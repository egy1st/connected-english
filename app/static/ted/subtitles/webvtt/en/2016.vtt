00:00:00.671 --> 00:00:03.612
Election night 2008

00:00:03.612 --> 00:00:06.971
was a night that tore me in half.

00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:11.360
It was the night that Barack Obama was elected.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.733
[One hundred and forty-three] 
years after the end of slavery,

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.010
and [43] years after the passage

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.750
of the Voting Rights Act,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.790
an African-American was elected president.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.537
Many of us never thought that this was possible

00:00:27.537 --> 00:00:30.309
until the moment that it happened.

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:33.524
And in many ways, it was the climax

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:35.330
of the black civil rights movement

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.388
in the United States.

00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:39.237
I was in California that night,

00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:41.123
which was ground zero at the time

00:00:41.123 --> 00:00:42.947
for another movement:

00:00:42.947 --> 00:00:45.940
the marriage equality movement.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.746
Gay marriage was on the ballot

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.830
in the form of Proposition 8,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.535
and as the election returns started to come in,

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:56.651
it became clear that the right

00:00:56.651 --> 00:00:59.024
for same sex couples to marry,

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:02.076
which had recently been granted
by the California courts,

00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:04.365
was going to be taken away.

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:06.548
So on the same night

00:01:06.548 --> 00:01:10.830
that Barack Obama won his historic presidency,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.322
the lesbian and gay community suffered

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:16.600
one of our most painful defeats.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.127
And then it got even worse.

00:01:20.127 --> 00:01:22.121
Pretty much immediately,

00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:24.567
African-Americans started to be blamed

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.899
for the passage of Proposition 8.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.496
This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said

00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:32.255
that blacks had voted for the measure

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:34.740
by something like 70 percent.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.455
This turned out not to be true,

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:42.029
but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in,

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:45.286
and was grabbed on by the media.

00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:47.972
I couldn't tear myself away from the coverage.

00:01:47.972 --> 00:01:50.999
I listened to some gay commentator say

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:53.388
that the African-American community

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:55.403
was notoriously homophobic,

00:01:55.403 --> 00:01:58.677
and now that civil rights had been achieved for us,

00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:00.810
we wanted to take away other people's rights.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.617
There were even reports of racist epithets

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:05.534
being thrown at some of the participants

00:02:05.534 --> 00:02:07.200
of the gay rights rallies

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.819
that took place after the election.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.810
And on the other side,

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.631
some African-Americans dismissed or ignored

00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:19.150
homophobia that was indeed real in our community.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.800
And others resented this comparison

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.130
between gay rights and civil rights,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.675
and once again, the sinking feeling

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:29.694
that two minority groups

00:02:29.694 --> 00:02:32.144
of which I'm both a part of

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:35.086
were competing with each other

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:37.777
instead of supporting each other

00:02:37.777 --> 00:02:42.303
overwhelmed and, frankly, pissed me off.

00:02:42.303 --> 00:02:45.436
Now, I'm a documentary filmmaker,

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.479
so after going through my pissed off stage

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.559
and yelling at the television and radio,

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.849
my next instinct was

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.928
to make a movie.

00:02:55.928 --> 00:03:00.280
And what guided me in making this film was,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.078
how was this happening?

00:03:02.078 --> 00:03:05.278
How was it that the gay rights movement

00:03:05.278 --> 00:03:08.589
was being pitted against the civil rights movement?

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.834
And this wasn't just an abstract question.

00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:14.189
I'm a beneficiary of both movements,

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.273
so this was actually personal.

00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:18.868
But then something else happened

00:03:18.868 --> 00:03:21.829
after that election in 2008.

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.217
The march towards gay equality

00:03:24.217 --> 00:03:26.266
accelerated at a pace

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:29.288
that surprised and shocked everyone,

00:03:29.288 --> 00:03:33.910
and is still reshaping our laws and our policies,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.963
our institutions and our entire country.

00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:40.828
And so it started to become increasingly clear to me

00:03:40.828 --> 00:03:42.926
that this pitting of the two movements

00:03:42.926 --> 00:03:46.508
against each other actually didn't make sense,

00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:47.740
and that they were in fact

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.061
much, much more interconnected,

00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:53.251
and that, in fact, some of the way

00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:55.570
that the gay rights movement has been able

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.145
to make such incredible gains so quickly

00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:01.193
is that it's used some of the same tactics

00:04:01.193 --> 00:04:04.880
and strategies that were first laid down

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.740
by the civil rights movement.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.493
Let's just look at a few of these strategies.

00:04:10.493 --> 00:04:12.772
First off, it's really interesting to see,

00:04:12.772 --> 00:04:14.740
to actually visually see, how quick

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.810
the gay rights movement has made its gains,

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.996
if you look at a few of the major events

00:04:19.996 --> 00:04:23.720
on a timeline of both freedom movements.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.302
Now, there are tons of milestones

00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:28.523
in the civil rights movement,

00:04:28.523 --> 00:04:30.416
but the first one we're going to start with

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:34.312
is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.

00:04:34.312 --> 00:04:36.900
This was a protest campaign

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.845
against Montgomery, Alabama's segregation

00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:41.852
on their public transit system,

00:04:41.852 --> 00:04:44.711
and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks

00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:47.839
refused to give up her seat to a white person.

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.117
The campaign lasted a year,

00:04:50.117 --> 00:04:52.216
and it galvanized the civil rights movement

00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:55.183
like nothing had before it.

00:04:55.183 --> 00:04:58.035
And I call this strategy the

00:04:58.035 --> 00:05:02.962
"I'm tired of your foot on my neck" strategy.

00:05:02.962 --> 00:05:07.303
So gays and lesbians have been in society

00:05:07.303 --> 00:05:09.770
since societies began,

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.377
but up until the mid-20th century,

00:05:12.377 --> 00:05:16.762
homosexual acts were still illegal in most states.

00:05:16.762 --> 00:05:20.872
So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott,

00:05:20.872 --> 00:05:25.276
a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy.

00:05:25.276 --> 00:05:28.495
It's known as Stonewall, in 1969,

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.710
and it's where a group of LGBT patrons

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.392
fought back against police beatings

00:05:34.392 --> 00:05:36.348
at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked

00:05:36.348 --> 00:05:38.540
three days of rioting.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.266
Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:43.197
were at the forefront of this rebellion,

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:45.466
and it's a really interesting example

00:05:45.466 --> 00:05:48.677
of the intersection of our struggles against racism,

00:05:48.677 --> 00:05:53.370
homophobia, gender identity and police brutality.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.932
After Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups

00:05:56.932 --> 00:05:59.271
sprang up all over the country,

00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:03.891
and the modern gay rights 
movement as we know it took off.

00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:07.085
So the next moment to look at on the timeline

00:06:07.085 --> 00:06:10.230
is the 1963 March on Washington.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.365
This was a seminal event
in the civil rights movement

00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:16.113
and it's where African-Americans called for both

00:06:16.113 --> 00:06:19.096
civil and economic justice.

00:06:19.096 --> 00:06:21.275
And it's of course where Martin Luther King

00:06:21.275 --> 00:06:23.538
delivered his famous "I have a dream" speech,

00:06:23.538 --> 00:06:25.533
but what's actually less known

00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:27.868
is that this march was organized

00:06:27.868 --> 00:06:31.178
by a man named Bayard Rustin.

00:06:31.178 --> 00:06:33.901
Bayard was an out gay man,

00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:36.533
and he's considered one of the most brilliant

00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:39.450
strategists of the civil rights movement.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.196
He later in his life became a fierce advocate

00:06:42.196 --> 00:06:45.073
of LGBT rights as well, and his life

00:06:45.073 --> 00:06:50.150
is testament to the intersection of the struggles.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.467
The March on Washington

00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:53.850
is one of the high points of the movement,

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.020
and it's where there was a fervent belief

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.215
that African-Americans too

00:06:59.215 --> 00:07:02.020
could be a part of American democracy.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.880
I call this strategy the

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.890
"We are visible and many in numbers" strategy.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.353
Some early gay activists were actually

00:07:11.353 --> 00:07:13.433
directly inspired by the march,

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.639
and some had taken part.

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.660
Gay pioneer Jack Nichols said,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.687
"We marched with Martin Luther King,

00:07:21.687 --> 00:07:24.289
seven of us from the Mattachine Society" --

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:26.740
which was an early gay rights organization —

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.291
"and from that moment on, we had our own dream

00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:33.440
about a gay rights march of similar proportions."

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.130
Several years later, a series of marches took place,

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.475
each one gaining the momentum

00:07:39.475 --> 00:07:41.281
of the gay freedom struggle.

00:07:41.281 --> 00:07:43.718
The first one was in 1979,

00:07:43.718 --> 00:07:48.267
and the second one took place in 1987.

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:51.993
The third one was held in 1993.

00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:55.258
Almost a million people showed up,

00:07:55.258 --> 00:07:58.799
and people were so energized and excited

00:07:58.799 --> 00:07:59.899
by what had taken place,

00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:02.298
they went back to their own communities

00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:03.931
and started their own political

00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:05.621
and social organizations,

00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:09.512
further increasing the visibility of the movement.

00:08:09.512 --> 00:08:11.429
The day of that march, October 11,

00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:14.090
was then declared National Coming Out Day,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.984
and is still celebrated all over the world.

00:08:16.984 --> 00:08:19.505
These marches set the groundwork

00:08:19.505 --> 00:08:22.225
for the historic changes that we see happening

00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:25.073
today in the United States.

00:08:25.073 --> 00:08:28.614
And lastly, the "Loving" strategy.

00:08:28.614 --> 00:08:30.790
The name speaks for itself.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.603
In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled

00:08:33.603 --> 00:08:35.492
in Loving v. Virginia,

00:08:35.492 --> 00:08:37.612
and invalidated all laws

00:08:37.612 --> 00:08:40.845
that prohibited interracial marriage.

00:08:40.845 --> 00:08:42.760
This is considered one of the Supreme Court's

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.097
landmark civil rights cases.

00:08:46.097 --> 00:08:49.010
In 1996, President Clinton signed

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.581
the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA,

00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:54.920
and that made the federal government

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.307
only have to recognize marriages

00:08:57.307 --> 00:09:01.276
between a man and a woman.

00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:03.690
In United States v. Windsor,

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.837
a 79-year-old lesbian named Edith Windsor

00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:08.800
sued the federal government

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.546
when she was forced to pay estate taxes

00:09:11.546 --> 00:09:13.048
on her deceased wife's property,

00:09:13.048 --> 00:09:16.365
something that heterosexual 
couples don't have to do.

00:09:16.365 --> 00:09:18.674
And as the case wound its way

00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:20.430
through the lower courts,

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:24.267
the Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent.

00:09:24.267 --> 00:09:26.561
When it got to the Supreme Court in 2013,

00:09:26.561 --> 00:09:28.284
the Supreme Court agreed,

00:09:28.284 --> 00:09:30.737
and DOMA was thrown out.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:33.131
It was incredible.

00:09:33.131 --> 00:09:34.778
But the gay marriage movement

00:09:34.778 --> 00:09:38.365
has been making gains for years now.

00:09:38.365 --> 00:09:40.930
To date, 17 states

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.509
have passed laws allowing marriage equality.

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:46.187
It's become the de facto battle

00:09:46.187 --> 00:09:48.710
for gay equality,

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.360
and it seems like daily,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.240
laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.827
even in places like Texas and Utah,

00:09:55.827 --> 00:09:59.145
which no one saw coming.

00:09:59.145 --> 00:10:01.140
So a lot has changed

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.402
since that night in 2008

00:10:03.402 --> 00:10:05.860
when I felt torn in half.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.210
I did go on to make that film.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.887
It's a documentary film,

00:10:09.887 --> 00:10:11.950
and it's called "The New Black,"

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.905
and it looks at how the African-American community

00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:16.918
is grappling with the gay rights issue

00:10:16.918 --> 00:10:19.364
in light of the gay marriage movement

00:10:19.364 --> 00:10:22.925
and this fight over the meaning of civil rights.

00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:24.717
And I wanted to capture

00:10:24.717 --> 00:10:27.798
some of this incredible change that was happening,

00:10:27.798 --> 00:10:30.890
and as luck or politics would have it,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.886
another marriage battle started gearing up,

00:10:33.886 --> 00:10:35.510
this time in Maryland,

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.997
where African-Americans make up 30 percent

00:10:37.997 --> 00:10:39.199
of the electorate.

00:10:39.199 --> 00:10:42.265
So this tension between gay rights

00:10:42.265 --> 00:10:46.229
and civil rights started to bubble up once again,

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.292
and I was lucky enough to capture

00:10:48.292 --> 00:10:51.702
how some people were making the connection

00:10:51.702 --> 00:10:54.780
between the movements this time.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.378
This is a clip of Karess Taylor-Hughes

00:10:57.378 --> 00:11:00.632
and Samantha Masters, two characters in the film,

00:11:00.632 --> 00:11:03.220
as they hit the streets of Baltimore

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.557
and try to convince potential voters.

00:11:05.557 --> 00:11:09.625
(Video) Samantha Masters: That's what's up,
man, this is a righteous man over here.

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:11.910
Okay, are you registered to vote?

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.090
Man: No.
Karess Taylor-Hughes: Okay. How old are you?

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.901
Man: 21.
KTH: 21? You gotta get registered to vote.

00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:16.691
We got to get you registered to vote.

00:11:16.691 --> 00:11:19.007
Man: I ain't voting on no gay shit.

00:11:19.007 --> 00:11:22.041
SM: Okay, why? What's up?
Man: I ain't with that.

00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:23.350
SM: That's not cool.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:28.362
Man: What made you be gay?
SM: So what made you be straight?

00:11:28.362 --> 00:11:33.175
So what made you be straight?

00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:37.322
Man 2: You can't answer that question. (Laughter)

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.050
KSM: I used to not have the same rights as you,

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.304
but I know that because a black man like yourself

00:11:41.304 --> 00:11:42.723
stood up for a woman like me,

00:11:42.723 --> 00:11:44.532
I know that I've got the same opportunities.

00:11:44.532 --> 00:11:46.408
So you, as a black man, have the opportunity

00:11:46.408 --> 00:11:47.720
to stand up for somebody else.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.919
Whether you're gay or not,

00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:50.400
these are your brothers and sisters out here,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.608
and they need you to represent.

00:11:51.608 --> 00:11:53.380
Man 2: Who is you to tell somebody

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.000
who they can't have sex with,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.325
who they can't be with?

00:11:56.325 --> 00:11:58.224
They ain't got that power.

00:11:58.224 --> 00:12:00.892
Nobody has that power to say,
you can't marry that young lady.

00:12:00.892 --> 00:12:02.696
Who has that power? Nobody.

00:12:02.696 --> 00:12:03.743
SM: But you know what?

00:12:03.743 --> 00:12:05.853
Our state has put the power in your hands,

00:12:05.853 --> 00:12:07.430
and so what we need you to do

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.910
is vote for, you gonna vote for 6.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.495
Man 2: I got you.

00:12:11.495 --> 00:12:13.409
SM: Vote for 6, okay?
Man 2: I got you.

00:12:13.409 --> 00:12:15.563
KSM: All right, do y'all need
community service hours?

00:12:15.563 --> 00:12:17.487
You do? All right, you can always volunteer with us

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:18.918
to get community service hours.

00:12:18.918 --> 00:12:20.244
Y'all want to do that?

00:12:20.244 --> 00:12:22.982
We feed you. We bring you pizza.

00:12:22.982 --> 00:12:25.672
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:25.672 --> 00:12:28.940
Yoruba Richen: Thank you.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.998
What's amazing to me about that clip

00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:34.392
that we just captured as we were filming

00:12:34.392 --> 00:12:37.160
is, it really shows how Karess

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.328
understands the history
of the civil rights movement,

00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:42.494
but she's not restricted by it.

00:12:42.494 --> 00:12:44.797
She doesn't just limit it to black people.

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:46.857
She sees it as a blueprint

00:12:46.857 --> 00:12:50.461
for expanding rights to gays and lesbians.

00:12:50.461 --> 00:12:53.390
Maybe because she's younger, she's like 25,

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.648
she's able to do this a little bit more easily,

00:12:55.648 --> 00:12:58.787
but the fact is that Maryland voters

00:12:58.787 --> 00:13:01.913
did pass that marriage equality amendment,

00:13:01.913 --> 00:13:04.333
and in fact it was the first time

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:07.212
that marriage equality was directly voted on

00:13:07.212 --> 00:13:09.581
and passed by the voters.

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:12.545
African-Americans supported it at a higher level

00:13:12.545 --> 00:13:13.731
than had ever been recorded.

00:13:13.731 --> 00:13:16.720
It was a complete turnaround from that night

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.074
in 2008 when Proposition 8 was passed.

00:13:21.074 --> 00:13:24.874
It was, and feels, monumental.

00:13:24.874 --> 00:13:28.108
We in the LGBT community have gone

00:13:28.108 --> 00:13:32.055
from being a pathologized and reviled

00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:33.859
and criminalized group

00:13:33.859 --> 00:13:38.166
to being seen as part of the great human quest

00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:40.890
for dignity and equality.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:44.767
We've gone from having to hide our sexuality

00:13:44.767 --> 00:13:47.381
in order to maintain our jobs and our families

00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:50.236
to literally getting a place at the table

00:13:50.236 --> 00:13:51.520
with the president

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.646
and a shout out at his second inauguration.

00:13:54.646 --> 00:13:56.207
I just want to read what he said

00:13:56.207 --> 00:13:58.169
at that inauguration:

00:13:58.169 --> 00:14:00.489
"We the people declare today

00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:03.525
that the most evident of truths,

00:14:03.525 --> 00:14:06.579
that all of us are created equal.

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:09.059
It is the star that guides us still,

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:11.285
just as it guided our forebears

00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:12.799
through Seneca Falls

00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:17.220
and Selma and Stonewall."

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.057
Now we know that everything is not perfect,

00:14:21.057 --> 00:14:22.970
especially when you look at what's happening

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.953
with the LGBT rights issue internationally,

00:14:25.953 --> 00:14:29.504
but it says something about how far we've come

00:14:29.504 --> 00:14:32.908
when our president puts the gay freedom struggle

00:14:32.908 --> 00:14:34.893
in the context of the other great freedom struggles

00:14:34.893 --> 00:14:37.260
of our time: the women's rights movement

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.556
and the civil rights movement.

00:14:39.556 --> 00:14:41.899
His statement demonstrates not only

00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:44.571
the interconnectedness of those movements,

00:14:44.571 --> 00:14:46.819
but how each one borrowed

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:50.084
and was inspired by the other.

00:14:50.084 --> 00:14:52.832
So just as Martin Luther King

00:14:52.832 --> 00:14:55.892
learned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics

00:14:55.892 --> 00:14:58.131
of civil disobedience and nonviolence,

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:01.230
which became a bedrock of
the civil rights movement,

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.238
the gay rights movement saw what worked

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:05.730
in the civil rights movement,

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.959
and they used some of those same strategies

00:15:07.959 --> 00:15:09.875
and tactics to make gains

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:12.910
at an even quicker pace.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.997
Maybe one more other reason

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.792
for the relative quick progress

00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:18.967
of the gay rights movement.

00:15:18.967 --> 00:15:21.847
Whereas a lot of us continue to still live

00:15:21.847 --> 00:15:24.516
in racially segregated spaces,

00:15:24.516 --> 00:15:27.326
LGBT folks, we are everywhere.

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:29.589
We are in urban communities

00:15:29.589 --> 00:15:31.072
and rural communities,

00:15:31.072 --> 00:15:33.533
communities of color, immigrant communities,

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:37.097
churches and mosques and synagogues.

00:15:37.097 --> 00:15:40.248
We are your mothers and brothers

00:15:40.248 --> 00:15:43.056
and sisters and sons.

00:15:43.056 --> 00:15:45.682
And when someone that you love

00:15:45.682 --> 00:15:47.562
or a family member comes out,

00:15:47.562 --> 00:15:52.066
it may be easier to support their quest for equality.

00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:54.245
And in fact, the gay rights movement

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.920
asks us to support justice and equality

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.423
from a space of love.

00:15:59.423 --> 00:16:01.883
That may be the biggest, greatest gift

00:16:01.883 --> 00:16:03.738
that the movement has given us.

00:16:03.738 --> 00:16:08.821
It calls on us to access that which is most universal

00:16:08.821 --> 00:16:10.733
and most intimate:

00:16:10.733 --> 00:16:13.470
a love of our brother and our sister

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.395
and our neighbor.

00:16:15.395 --> 00:16:18.198
I just want to end with a quote

00:16:18.198 --> 00:16:20.332
by one of our greatest freedom fighters

00:16:20.332 --> 00:16:23.100
who's no longer with us, Nelson Mandela

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.403
of South Africa.

00:16:24.403 --> 00:16:27.304
Nelson Mandela led South Africa

00:16:27.304 --> 00:16:30.664
after the dark and brutal days of Apartheid,

00:16:30.664 --> 00:16:35.399
and out of the ashes of that 
legalized racial discrimination,

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:38.363
he led South Africa to become the first country

00:16:38.363 --> 00:16:41.472
in the world to ban discrimination

00:16:41.472 --> 00:16:45.626
based on sexual orientation within its constitution.

00:16:45.626 --> 00:16:48.281
Mandela said,

00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:53.207
"For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains,

00:16:53.207 --> 00:16:56.150
but to live in a way that respects

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.399
and enhances the freedom of others."

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:04.077
So as these movements continue on,

00:17:04.077 --> 00:17:07.038
and as freedom struggles
around the world continue on,

00:17:07.038 --> 00:17:10.698
let's remember that not only are they interconnected,

00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:14.589
but they must support and enhance each other

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:17.873
for us to be truly victorious.

00:17:17.873 --> 00:17:19.848
Thank you.

00:17:19.848 --> 00:17:25.408
(Applause)
