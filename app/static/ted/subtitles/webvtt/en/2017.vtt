00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.463
I grew up in a very small country town

00:00:02.463 --> 00:00:03.763
in Victoria.

00:00:03.763 --> 00:00:08.180
I had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.580
I went to school, I hung out with my friends,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.966
I fought with my younger sisters.

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.755
It was all very normal.

00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:19.927
And when I was 15, a member of my local community

00:00:19.927 --> 00:00:21.347
approached my parents

00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:22.740
and wanted to nominate me

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.860
for a community achievement award.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.103
And my parents said, "Hm, that's really nice,

00:00:29.103 --> 00:00:32.320
but there's kind of one glaring problem with that.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.254
She hasn't actually achieved anything." (Laughter)

00:00:37.254 --> 00:00:38.849
And they were right, you know.

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:41.835
I went to school, I got good marks,

00:00:41.835 --> 00:00:44.283
I had a very low-key after school job

00:00:44.283 --> 00:00:46.065
in my mum's hairdressing salon,

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:47.863
and I spent a lot of time watching

00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:50.994
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Dawson's Creek."

00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:55.037
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.

00:00:55.037 --> 00:00:56.377
But they were right, you know.

00:00:56.377 --> 00:00:58.930
I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.611
at all.

00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:03.554
I wasn't doing anything that could
be considered an achievement

00:01:03.554 --> 00:01:07.156
if you took disability out of the equation.

00:01:07.156 --> 00:01:11.022
Years later, I was on my second teaching round

00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:12.758
in a Melbourne high school,

00:01:12.758 --> 00:01:17.709
and I was about 20 minutes into
a year 11 legal studies class

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:19.488
when this boy put up his hand and said,

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:23.732
"Hey miss, when are you going
to start doing your speech?"

00:01:23.732 --> 00:01:25.709
And I said, "What speech?"

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:27.013
You know, I'd been talking them

00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:29.909
about defamation law for a good 20 minutes.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.580
And he said, "You know, like,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.900
your motivational speaking.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.890
You know, when people in
wheelchairs come to school,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.813
they usually say, like, inspirational stuff?"

00:01:40.813 --> 00:01:42.259
(Laughter)

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.557
"It's usually in the big hall."

00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:48.770
And that's when it dawned on me:

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.041
This kid had only ever experienced disabled people

00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:55.699
as objects of inspiration.

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.560
We are not, to this kid --

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.861
and it's not his fault, I mean,

00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:00.672
that's true for many of us.

00:02:00.672 --> 00:02:04.418
For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers

00:02:04.418 --> 00:02:07.477
or our doctors or our manicurists.

00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:12.846
We're not real people. We are there to inspire.

00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:16.352
And in fact, I am sitting on this stage

00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:19.434
looking like I do in this wheelchair,

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:22.367
and you are probably kind of expecting me

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:27.147
to inspire you. Right? (Laughter)

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.990
Yeah.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.004
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid

00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:34.861
I'm going to disappoint you dramatically.

00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.030
I am not here to inspire you.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.607
I am here to tell you that we have been lied to

00:02:39.607 --> 00:02:41.574
about disability.

00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:43.681
Yeah, we've been sold the lie

00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:48.886
that disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T.

00:02:48.886 --> 00:02:51.827
It's a bad thing, and to live with a disability

00:02:51.827 --> 00:02:53.973
makes you exceptional.

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:56.888
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't

00:02:56.888 --> 00:02:59.517
make you exceptional.

00:02:59.517 --> 00:03:01.252
And in the past few years, we've been able

00:03:01.252 --> 00:03:03.875
to propagate this lie even further

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.149
via social media.

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:08.382
You may have seen images like this one:

00:03:08.382 --> 00:03:11.985
"The only disability in life is a bad attitude."

00:03:12.975 --> 00:03:17.326
Or this one: "Your excuse is invalid." Indeed.

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:23.686
Or this one: "Before you quit, try!"

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:25.342
These are just a couple of examples,

00:03:25.342 --> 00:03:27.311
but there are a lot of these images out there.

00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:28.940
You know, you might have seen the one,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.689
the little girl with no hands

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.400
drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.120
You might have seen a child running

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.993
on carbon fiber prosthetic legs.

00:03:38.993 --> 00:03:40.344
And these images,

00:03:40.344 --> 00:03:41.970
there are lots of them out there,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.884
they are what we call inspiration porn.

00:03:45.884 --> 00:03:48.110
(Laughter)

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.328
And I use the term porn deliberately,

00:03:50.328 --> 00:03:53.477
because they objectify one group of people

00:03:53.477 --> 00:03:56.288
for the benefit of another group of people.

00:03:56.288 --> 00:03:59.167
So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:01.824
for the benefit of nondisabled people.

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:03.952
The purpose of these images

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:07.763
is to inspire you, to motivate you,

00:04:07.763 --> 00:04:09.838
so that we can look at them

00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:12.927
and think, "Well, however bad my life is,

00:04:12.927 --> 00:04:14.958
it could be worse.

00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.286
I could be that person."

00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:21.662
But what if you are that person?

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:23.750
I've lost count of the number of times that I've

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.218
been approached by strangers

00:04:26.218 --> 00:04:29.123
wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave

00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:30.880
or inspirational,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.539
and this was long before my work

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.593
had any kind of public profile.

00:04:34.593 --> 00:04:36.295
They were just kind of congratulating me

00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:38.001
for managing to get up in the morning

00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:42.009
and remember my own name. (Laughter)

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.547
And it is objectifying.

00:04:44.547 --> 00:04:46.640
These images, those images

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.571
objectify disabled people

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:51.496
for the benefit of nondisabled people.

00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:54.110
They are there so that you can look at them

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.813
and think that things aren't so bad for you,

00:04:56.813 --> 00:05:00.960
to put your worries into perspective.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.881
And life as a disabled person

00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:05.965
is actually somewhat difficult.

00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:08.071
We do overcome some things.

00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:10.283
But the things that we're overcoming

00:05:10.283 --> 00:05:12.900
are not the things that you think they are.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.507
They are not things to do with our bodies.

00:05:15.507 --> 00:05:17.885
I use the term "disabled people" quite deliberately,

00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:22.083
because I subscribe to what's called
the social model of disability,

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:24.381
which tells us that we are more disabled

00:05:24.381 --> 00:05:28.295
by the society that we live in

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:31.178
than by our bodies and our diagnoses.

00:05:31.178 --> 00:05:35.086
So I have lived in this body a long time.

00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:37.349
I'm quite fond of it.

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.402
It does the things that I need it to do,

00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:43.695
and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity

00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:44.829
just as you have,

00:05:44.829 --> 00:05:47.853
and that's the thing about those
kids in those pictures as well.

00:05:47.853 --> 00:05:51.132
They're not doing anything out of the ordinary.

00:05:51.132 --> 00:05:53.481
They are just using their bodies

00:05:53.481 --> 00:05:55.790
to the best of their capacity.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.293
So is it really fair to objectify them

00:05:59.293 --> 00:06:01.016
in the way that we do,

00:06:01.016 --> 00:06:03.118
to share those images?

00:06:03.118 --> 00:06:07.641
People, when they say, "You're an inspiration,"

00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.926
they mean it as a compliment.

00:06:10.926 --> 00:06:12.292
And I know why it happens.

00:06:12.292 --> 00:06:14.564
It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold

00:06:14.564 --> 00:06:18.778
this lie that disability makes you exceptional.

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:20.612
And it honestly doesn't.

00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:21.971
And I know what you're thinking.

00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:24.720
You know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.639
and you're thinking, "Jeez, Stella,

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.756
aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:32.850
And the thing is, I am.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.888
I learn from other disabled people all the time.

00:06:35.888 --> 00:06:40.827
I'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.

00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:43.982
I am learning that it's a genius idea

00:06:43.982 --> 00:06:45.403
to use a pair of barbecue tongs

00:06:45.403 --> 00:06:51.160
to pick up things that you dropped. (Laughter)

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.681
I'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge

00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:58.266
your mobile phone battery from your chair battery.

00:06:58.266 --> 00:06:59.480
Genius.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.061
We are learning from each
others' strength and endurance,

00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:04.702
not against our bodies and our diagnoses,

00:07:04.702 --> 00:07:07.506
but against a world that exceptionalizes

00:07:07.506 --> 00:07:09.963
and objectifies us.

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:12.598
I really think that this lie that we've been sold

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:16.821
about disability is the greatest injustice.

00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:20.956
It makes life hard for us.

00:07:20.956 --> 00:07:24.829
And that quote, "The only disability in life

00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:26.827
is a bad attitude,"

00:07:26.827 --> 00:07:29.954
the reason that that's bullshit

00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:31.575
is because it's just not true,

00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:34.237
because of the social model of disability.

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:38.402
No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs

00:07:38.402 --> 00:07:43.348
has ever made it turn into a ramp.

00:07:43.348 --> 00:07:49.930
Never. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.810
Smiling at a television screen

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.641
isn't going to make closed captions appear

00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:55.374
for people who are deaf.

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:57.836
No amount of standing
in the middle of a bookshop

00:07:57.836 --> 00:07:59.606
and radiating a positive attitude

00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:02.305
is going to turn all those books into braille.

00:08:02.305 --> 00:08:06.509
It's just not going to happen.

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:09.236
I really want to live in a world

00:08:09.236 --> 00:08:12.900
where disability is not the exception, but the norm.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.096
I want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl

00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:16.830
sitting in her bedroom

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.007
watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"

00:08:19.007 --> 00:08:21.545
isn't referred to as achieving anything

00:08:21.545 --> 00:08:23.811
because she's doing it sitting down.

00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:25.236
I want to live in a world

00:08:25.236 --> 00:08:28.361
where we don't have such low expectations

00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:29.910
of disabled people

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.236
that we are congratulated for getting out of bed

00:08:32.236 --> 00:08:35.033
and remembering our own names in the morning.

00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:38.454
I want to live in a world where
we value genuine achievement

00:08:38.454 --> 00:08:40.217
for disabled people,

00:08:40.217 --> 00:08:41.824
and I want to live in a world

00:08:41.824 --> 00:08:45.236
where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:47.589
is not one bit surprised

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:50.747
that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.

00:08:50.747 --> 00:08:53.790
Disability doesn't make you exceptional,

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.243
but questioning what you
think you know about it does.

00:08:57.243 --> 00:08:58.510
Thank you.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.469
(Applause)
