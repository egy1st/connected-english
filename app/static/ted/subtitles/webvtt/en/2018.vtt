00:00:00.531 --> 00:00:03.107
It was less than a year after September 11,

00:00:03.107 --> 00:00:04.782
and I was at the Chicago Tribune

00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:06.656
writing about shootings and murders,

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:08.118
and it was leaving me feeling

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:09.900
pretty dark and depressed.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.482
I had done some activism in college,

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:13.129
so I decided to help a local group

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.838
hang door knockers against animal testing.

00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:17.345
I thought it would be a safe way

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:19.227
to do something positive,

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.793
but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever,

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:24.118
and we were all arrested.

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:26.330
Police took this blurry photo of me

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.556
holding leaflets as evidence.

00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:31.420
My charges were dismissed,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.556
but a few weeks later,

00:00:32.556 --> 00:00:34.593
two FBI agents knocked on my door,

00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:36.354
and they told me that unless I helped them

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:38.455
by spying on protest groups,

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:42.272
they would put me on a domestic terrorist list.

00:00:42.272 --> 00:00:44.308
I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch,

00:00:44.308 --> 00:00:46.299
but I was terrified,

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:48.183
and when my fear subsided,

00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:50.100
I became obsessed with finding out

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.217
how this happened,

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.395
how animal rights and environmental activists

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:55.609
who have never injured anyone

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.522
could become the FBI's number one

00:00:57.522 --> 00:01:00.726
domestic terrorism threat.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:02.696
A few years later, I was invited to testify

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:05.200
before Congress about my reporting,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.558
and I told lawmakers that, while everybody

00:01:06.558 --> 00:01:08.283
is talking about going green,

00:01:08.283 --> 00:01:09.821
some people are risking their lives

00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:13.333
to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines.

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.382
They're physically putting their bodies on the line

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:18.807
between the whalers' harpoons and the whales.

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:20.496
These are everyday people,

00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:22.582
like these protesters in Italy

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.644
who spontaneously climbed over

00:01:24.644 --> 00:01:26.945
barbed wire fences to rescue beagles

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:29.106
from animal testing.

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:31.782
And these movements have been incredibly effective

00:01:31.782 --> 00:01:33.720
and popular,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.581
so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word,

00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:39.145
eco-terrorist,

00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:41.269
to shift how we view them.

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:43.156
They just made it up.

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:45.693
Now these companies have backed new laws

00:01:45.693 --> 00:01:48.432
like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act,

00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:50.551
which turns activism into terrorism

00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:53.319
if it causes a loss of profits.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.318
Now most people never even heard about this law,

00:01:56.318 --> 00:01:58.444
including members of Congress.

00:01:58.444 --> 00:02:00.355
Less than one percent were in the room

00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:02.815
when it passed the House.

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:05.718
The rest were outside at a new memorial.

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:07.379
They were praising Dr. King

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:10.805
as his style of activism was branded as terrorism

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:14.456
if done in the name of animals or the environment.

00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:16.393
Supporters say laws like this are needed

00:02:16.393 --> 00:02:18.242
for the extremists:

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:21.191
the vandals, the arsonists, the radicals.

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:23.453
But right now, companies like TransCanada

00:02:23.453 --> 00:02:26.778
are briefing police in presentations like this one

00:02:26.778 --> 00:02:29.467
about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:31.605
as terrorists.

00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:35.228
The FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism

00:02:35.228 --> 00:02:36.779
are not about violence,

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:39.492
they're about public relations.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.465
Today, in multiple countries,

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:42.953
corporations are pushing new laws

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:44.667
that make it illegal to photograph

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:47.927
animal cruelty on their farms.

00:02:47.927 --> 00:02:50.454
The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago,

00:02:50.454 --> 00:02:52.227
and today we released a lawsuit

00:02:52.227 --> 00:02:53.954
challenging it as unconstitutional

00:02:53.954 --> 00:02:56.527
as a threat to journalism.

00:02:56.527 --> 00:02:58.865
The first of these ag-gag prosecutions,

00:02:58.865 --> 00:03:00.300
as they're called,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.952
was a young woman named Amy Meyer,

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:03.565
and Amy saw a sick cow being moved

00:03:03.565 --> 00:03:06.114
by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse

00:03:06.114 --> 00:03:08.528
as she was on the public street.

00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:10.739
And Amy did what any of us would:

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.514
She filmed it.

00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:15.563
When I found out about her story, I wrote about it,

00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:18.488
and within 24 hours, it created such an uproar

00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:21.738
that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges.

00:03:21.738 --> 00:03:23.756
But apparently, even exposing stuff like that

00:03:23.756 --> 00:03:25.576
is a threat.

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:27.240
Through the Freedom of Information Act,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.100
I learned that the counter-terrorism unit

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.177
has been monitoring my articles

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.463
and speeches like this one.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.689
They even included this nice
little write-up of my book.

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.804
They described it as "compelling and well-written."

00:03:38.804 --> 00:03:43.525
(Applause)

00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:46.760
Blurb on the next book, right?

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.400
The point of all of this is to make us afraid,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.289
but as a journalist, I have an unwavering faith

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:54.120
in the power of education.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.687
Our best weapon is sunlight.

00:03:57.687 --> 00:03:59.574
Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man

00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:02.899
is to prove he's a man and not a piano key.

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:04.461
Over and over throughout history,

00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:06.449
people in power have used fear

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:10.248
to silence the truth and to silence dissent.

00:04:10.248 --> 00:04:12.287
It's time we strike a new note.

00:04:12.287 --> 00:04:14.262
Thank you.

00:04:14.262 --> 00:04:16.116
(Applause)
