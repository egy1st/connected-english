00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:02.620
Four years ago,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.422
a security researcher,

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:08.671
or, as most people would call it, a hacker,

00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:10.838
found a way to literally

00:00:10.838 --> 00:00:14.041
make ATMs throw money at him.

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:17.382
His name was Barnaby Jack,

00:00:17.382 --> 00:00:21.041
and this technique was later called "jackpotting"

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:22.950
in his honor.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.799
I'm here today because I think

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:27.850
we actually need hackers.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.712
Barnaby Jack

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:31.199
could have easily turned

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.397
into a career criminal or James Bond villain

00:00:35.397 --> 00:00:36.893
with his knowledge,

00:00:36.893 --> 00:00:39.381
but he chose to show the world

00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:42.070
his research instead.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.923
He believed that sometimes

00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:45.963
you have to demo a threat

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:48.880
to spark a solution.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.810
And I feel the same way.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.660
That's why I'm here today.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.938
We are often terrified and fascinated

00:00:55.938 --> 00:00:59.399
by the power hackers now have.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.131
They scare us.

00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:03.116
But the choices they make

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:05.286
have dramatic outcomes

00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:08.274
that influence us all.

00:01:08.274 --> 00:01:11.609
So I am here today because I think we need hackers,

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.192
and in fact, they just might be

00:01:15.192 --> 00:01:19.532
the immune system for the information age.

00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:21.565
Sometimes they make us sick,

00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:24.920
but they also find those hidden threats

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.244
in our world,

00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:29.089
and they make us fix it.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.447
I knew that I might get hacked

00:01:31.447 --> 00:01:33.855
for giving this talk,

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:36.328
so let me save you the effort.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:38.162
In true TED fashion,

00:01:38.162 --> 00:01:42.135
here is my most embarrassing picture.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:45.005
But it would be difficult for you to find me in it,

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:48.743
because I'm the one who looks like a boy

00:01:48.743 --> 00:01:50.548
standing to the side.

00:01:50.548 --> 00:01:52.930
I was such a nerd back then

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.532
that even the boys on the
Dungeons and Dragons team

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.729
wouldn't let me join.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.714
This is who I was,

00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:03.829
but this is who I wanted to be:

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.727
Angelina Jolie.

00:02:05.727 --> 00:02:07.282
She portrayed Acid Burn

00:02:07.282 --> 00:02:09.776
in the '95 film "Hackers."

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:12.954
She was pretty and she could rollerblade,

00:02:12.954 --> 00:02:17.063
but being a hacker, that made her powerful.

00:02:17.063 --> 00:02:19.523
And I wanted to be just like her,

00:02:19.523 --> 00:02:21.889
so I started spending a lot of time

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.774
on hacker chat rooms and online forums.

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:27.107
I remember one late night

00:02:27.107 --> 00:02:29.368
I found a bit of PHP code.

00:02:29.368 --> 00:02:30.990
I didn't really know what it did,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.615
but I copy-pasted it

00:02:32.615 --> 00:02:34.329
and used it anyway

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.802
to get into a password-protected site

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:38.606
like that.

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:40.009
Open Sesame.

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:41.531
It was a simple trick,

00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:44.536
and I was just a script kiddie back then,

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:45.974
but to me, that trick,

00:02:45.974 --> 00:02:48.189
it felt like this,

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.633
like I had discovered limitless potential

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:52.424
at my fingertips.

00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:55.733
This is the rush of power that hackers feel.

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:58.637
It's geeks just like me

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:01.869
discovering they have access to superpower,

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.496
one that requires the skill and tenacity

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:06.004
of their intellect,

00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:09.565
but thankfully no radioactive spiders.

00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:11.406
But with great power

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:13.710
comes great responsibility,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.374
and you all like to think that if we had such powers,

00:03:17.374 --> 00:03:19.653
we would only use them for good.

00:03:19.653 --> 00:03:23.000
But what if you could read your ex's emails,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.112
or add a couple zeros to your bank account.

00:03:26.112 --> 00:03:28.132
What would you do then?

00:03:28.132 --> 00:03:30.369
Indeed, many hackers do not resist

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:32.357
those temptations,

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:35.482
and so they are responsible in one way or another

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.886
to billions of dollars lost each year

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:41.147
to fraud, malware or plain old identity theft,

00:03:41.147 --> 00:03:43.025
which is a serious issue.

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:45.010
But there are other hackers,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.772
hackers who just like to break things,

00:03:47.772 --> 00:03:50.480
and it is precisely those hackers

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.773
that can find the weaker elements in our world

00:03:53.773 --> 00:03:55.450
and make us fix it.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.370
This is what happened last year

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.379
when another security researcher

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.944
called Kyle Lovett

00:04:00.944 --> 00:04:02.501
discovered a gaping hole

00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.461
in the design of certain wireless routers

00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:08.000
like you might have in your home or office.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.645
He learned that anyone could remotely connect

00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:12.967
to these devices over the Internet

00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:15.728
and download documents from hard drives

00:04:15.728 --> 00:04:17.903
attached to those routers,

00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:19.750
no password needed.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.087
He reported it to the company, of course,

00:04:22.087 --> 00:04:24.401
but they ignored his report.

00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.265
Perhaps they thought universal access

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:29.250
was a feature, not a bug,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.105
until two months ago

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:32.538
when a group of hackers used it

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.992
to get into people's files.

00:04:34.992 --> 00:04:37.393
But they didn't steal anything.

00:04:37.393 --> 00:04:39.410
They left a note:

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.288
Your router and your documents

00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:43.447
can be accessed by anyone in the world.

00:04:43.447 --> 00:04:45.715
Here's what you should do to fix it.

00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:48.093
We hope we helped.

00:04:48.093 --> 00:04:50.623
By getting into people's files like that,

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.083
yeah, they broke the law,

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.551
but they also forced that company

00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:56.532
to fix their product.

00:04:56.532 --> 00:04:58.700
Making vulnerabilities known to the public

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.445
is a practice called full disclosure

00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:03.047
in the hacker community,

00:05:03.047 --> 00:05:05.081
and it is controversial,

00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:07.613
but it does make me think of how hackers

00:05:07.613 --> 00:05:10.599
have an evolving effect on technologies we use

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.095
every day.

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:14.373
This is what Khalil did.

00:05:14.373 --> 00:05:16.988
Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank,

00:05:16.988 --> 00:05:20.997
and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook

00:05:20.997 --> 00:05:22.847
which he attempted to report

00:05:22.847 --> 00:05:25.837
through the company's bug bounty program.

00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:28.494
These are usually great arrangements for companies

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:31.671
to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities

00:05:31.671 --> 00:05:33.360
they find in their code.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.910
Unfortunately, due to some miscommunications,

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.946
his report was not acknowledged.

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:41.791
Frustrated with the exchange,

00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:45.068
he took to use his own discovery

00:05:45.068 --> 00:05:48.203
to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall.

00:05:48.203 --> 00:05:50.970
This got their attention, all right,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.265
and they fixed the bug,

00:05:54.265 --> 00:05:57.120
but because he hadn't reported it properly,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.345
he was denied the bounty usually paid out

00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:01.349
for such discoveries.

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.338
Thankfully for Khalil,

00:06:03.338 --> 00:06:06.224
a group of hackers were watching out for him.

00:06:06.224 --> 00:06:10.033
In fact, they raised more than 13,000 dollars

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:12.111
to reward him for this discovery,

00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:15.311
raising a vital discussion in the technology industry

00:06:15.311 --> 00:06:18.370
about how we come up with incentives

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.960
for hackers to do the right thing.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.980
But I think there's a greater story here still.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.915
Even companies founded by hackers,

00:06:26.915 --> 00:06:29.302
like Facebook was,

00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:31.885
still have a complicated relationship

00:06:31.885 --> 00:06:33.689
when it comes to hackers.

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:36.520
And so for more conservative organizations,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.038
it is going to take time and adapting

00:06:40.038 --> 00:06:42.620
in order to embrace hacker culture

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.741
and the creative chaos that it brings with it.

00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:48.183
But I think it's worth the effort,

00:06:48.183 --> 00:06:50.163
because the alternative,

00:06:50.163 --> 00:06:53.993
to blindly fight all hackers,

00:06:53.993 --> 00:06:56.581
is to go against the power you cannot control

00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:59.882
at the cost of stifling innovation

00:06:59.882 --> 00:07:02.076
and regulating knowledge.

00:07:02.076 --> 00:07:06.370
These are things that will come back and bite you.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.848
It is even more true

00:07:07.848 --> 00:07:09.927
if we go after hackers

00:07:09.927 --> 00:07:12.964
that are willing to risk their own freedom

00:07:12.964 --> 00:07:15.867
for ideals like the freedom of the web,

00:07:15.867 --> 00:07:19.930
especially in times like this, like today even,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.550
as governments and corporates

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.776
fight to control the Internet.

00:07:25.776 --> 00:07:28.100
I find it astounding

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.113
that someone from the shadowy
corners of cyberspace

00:07:31.113 --> 00:07:33.928
can become its voice of opposition,

00:07:33.928 --> 00:07:36.570
its last line of defense even,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.987
perhaps someone like Anonymous,

00:07:39.987 --> 00:07:43.840
the leading brand of global hacktivism.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.100
This universal hacker movement

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.706
needs no introduction today,

00:07:47.706 --> 00:07:49.809
but six years ago

00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:53.238
they were not much more than an Internet subculture

00:07:53.238 --> 00:07:56.157
dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats

00:07:56.157 --> 00:07:59.587
and Internet trolling campaigns.

00:07:59.587 --> 00:08:04.429
Their moment of transformation was in early 2008

00:08:04.429 --> 00:08:06.079
when the Church of Scientology

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:09.146
attempted to remove certain leaked videos

00:08:09.146 --> 00:08:13.549
from appearing on certain websites.

00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:15.989
This is when Anonymous was forged

00:08:15.989 --> 00:08:18.620
out of the seemingly random collection

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.363
of Internet dwellers.

00:08:20.363 --> 00:08:22.817
It turns out,

00:08:22.817 --> 00:08:24.146
the Internet doesn't like it

00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:26.769
when you try to remove things from it,

00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:29.739
and it will react with cyberattacks

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:31.840
and elaborate pranks

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.489
and with a series of organized protests

00:08:34.489 --> 00:08:35.834
all around the world,

00:08:35.834 --> 00:08:37.822
from my hometown of Tel Aviv

00:08:37.822 --> 00:08:40.066
to Adelaide, Australia.

00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:43.196
This proved that Anonymous and this idea

00:08:43.196 --> 00:08:46.279
can rally the masses from the keyboards

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:47.855
to the streets,

00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:49.802
and it laid the foundations

00:08:49.802 --> 00:08:52.020
for dozens of future operations

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.960
against perceived injustices

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.316
to their online and offline world.

00:08:57.316 --> 00:08:59.341
Since then, they've gone after many targets.

00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:02.130
They've uncovered corruption, abuse.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.950
They've hacked popes and politicians,

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.627
and I think their effect is larger

00:09:06.627 --> 00:09:09.424
than simple denial of service attacks

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:10.800
that take down websites

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.438
or even leak sensitive documents.

00:09:14.438 --> 00:09:17.480
I think that, like Robin Hood,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.380
they are in the business of redistribution,

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.112
but what they are after isn't your money.

00:09:24.112 --> 00:09:28.842
It's not your documents. It's your attention.

00:09:28.842 --> 00:09:33.382
They grab the spotlight for causes they support,

00:09:33.382 --> 00:09:36.013
forcing us to take note,

00:09:36.013 --> 00:09:38.478
acting as a global magnifying glass

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:40.622
for issues that we are not as aware of

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.731
but perhaps we should be.

00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:44.584
They have been called many names

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.355
from criminals to terrorists,

00:09:46.355 --> 00:09:49.801
and I cannot justify their illegal means,

00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:51.942
but the ideas they fight for

00:09:51.942 --> 00:09:55.968
are ones that matter to us all.

00:09:55.968 --> 00:09:57.951
The reality is,

00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:00.756
hackers can do a lot more than break things.

00:10:00.756 --> 00:10:03.229
They can bring people together.

00:10:03.229 --> 00:10:05.552
And if the Internet doesn't like it

00:10:05.552 --> 00:10:08.199
when you try to remove things from it,

00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:09.100
just watch what happens

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.929
when you try to shut the Internet down.

00:10:11.929 --> 00:10:16.521
This took place in Egypt in January 2011,

00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:19.737
and as President Hosni Mubarak

00:10:19.737 --> 00:10:21.791
attempted a desperate move

00:10:21.791 --> 00:10:25.633
to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo,

00:10:25.633 --> 00:10:27.503
he sent his personal troops

00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:31.146
down to Egypt's Internet service providers

00:10:31.146 --> 00:10:33.617
and had them physically kill the switch

00:10:33.617 --> 00:10:37.862
on the country's connection to the world overnight.

00:10:37.862 --> 00:10:39.477
For a government to do a thing like that

00:10:39.477 --> 00:10:41.196
was unprecedented,

00:10:41.196 --> 00:10:44.660
and for hackers, it made it personal.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.748
Hackers like the Telecomix group

00:10:46.748 --> 00:10:48.621
were already active on the ground,

00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:51.439
helping Egyptians bypass censorship

00:10:51.439 --> 00:10:53.929
using clever workarounds like Morse code

00:10:53.929 --> 00:10:55.957
and ham radio.

00:10:55.957 --> 00:10:58.086
It was high season for low tech,

00:10:58.086 --> 00:11:00.650
which the government couldn't block,

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.892
but when the Net went completely down,

00:11:03.892 --> 00:11:06.830
Telecomix brought in the big guns.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.001
They found European service providers

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.310
that still had 20-year-old

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.890
analog dial-up access infrastructure.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.292
They opened up 300 of those lines

00:11:17.292 --> 00:11:19.766
for Egyptians to use,

00:11:19.766 --> 00:11:22.603
serving slow but sweet Internet connection

00:11:22.603 --> 00:11:24.004
for Egyptians.

00:11:24.004 --> 00:11:25.299
This worked.

00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:27.092
It worked so well, in fact,

00:11:27.092 --> 00:11:29.372
one guy even used it to download an episode

00:11:29.372 --> 00:11:33.710
of "How I Met Your Mother."

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.631
But while Egypt's future is still uncertain,

00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:40.284
when the same thing happened in Syria

00:11:40.284 --> 00:11:41.804
just one year later,

00:11:41.804 --> 00:11:45.539
Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines,

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:46.708
and Anonymous,

00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:48.954
they were perhaps the first international group

00:11:48.954 --> 00:11:50.658
to officially denounce the actions

00:11:50.658 --> 00:11:52.571
of the Syrian military

00:11:52.571 --> 00:11:55.375
by defacing their website.

00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:58.867
But with this sort of power,

00:11:58.867 --> 00:12:01.213
it really depends on where you stand,

00:12:01.213 --> 00:12:04.722
because one man's hero

00:12:04.722 --> 00:12:06.969
can be another's villain,

00:12:06.969 --> 00:12:09.367
and so the Syrian Electronic Army

00:12:09.367 --> 00:12:11.838
is a pro-Assad group of hackers

00:12:11.838 --> 00:12:14.503
who support his contentious regime.

00:12:14.503 --> 00:12:17.185
They've taken down multiple high-profile targets

00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:18.820
in the past few years,

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.203
including the Associated Press's Twitter account,

00:12:22.203 --> 00:12:25.219
in which they posted a message

00:12:25.219 --> 00:12:27.375
about an attack on the White House

00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:30.638
injuring President Obama.

00:12:30.638 --> 00:12:32.783
This tweet was fake, of course,

00:12:32.783 --> 00:12:35.722
but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index

00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:39.099
that day was most certainly not,

00:12:39.099 --> 00:12:42.361
and a lot of people lost a lot of money.

00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:46.267
This sort of thing is happening
all over the world right now.

00:12:46.267 --> 00:12:49.214
In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula

00:12:49.214 --> 00:12:51.576
to Latin America,

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:53.880
from Europe to the United States,

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.937
hackers are a force for social,

00:12:56.937 --> 00:13:00.703
political and military influence.

00:13:00.703 --> 00:13:02.954
As individuals or in groups,

00:13:02.954 --> 00:13:05.594
volunteers or military conflicts,

00:13:05.594 --> 00:13:08.235
there are hackers everywhere.

00:13:08.235 --> 00:13:10.330
They come from all walks of life,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.254
ethnicities, ideologies and genders, I might add.

00:13:15.254 --> 00:13:19.053
They are now shaping the world's stage.

00:13:19.053 --> 00:13:21.898
Hackers represent an exceptional force for change

00:13:21.898 --> 00:13:24.062
in the 21st century.

00:13:24.062 --> 00:13:26.599
This is because access to information

00:13:26.599 --> 00:13:29.912
is a critical currency of power,

00:13:29.912 --> 00:13:32.878
one which governments would like to control,

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:35.339
a thing they attempt to do by setting up

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:38.999
all-you-can-eat surveillance programs,

00:13:38.999 --> 00:13:41.737
a thing they need hackers for, by the way.

00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:44.384
And so the establishment has long had

00:13:44.384 --> 00:13:48.091
a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers,

00:13:48.091 --> 00:13:50.849
because the same people who demonize hacking

00:13:50.849 --> 00:13:55.931
also utilize it at large.

00:13:55.931 --> 00:13:57.179
Two years ago,

00:13:57.179 --> 00:13:59.952
I saw General Keith Alexander.

00:13:59.952 --> 00:14:04.170
He's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander,

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.878
but instead of his four star general uniform,

00:14:07.878 --> 00:14:10.174
he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt.

00:14:10.174 --> 00:14:11.918
This was at DEF CON,

00:14:11.918 --> 00:14:15.023
the world's largest hacker conference.

00:14:15.023 --> 00:14:16.950
Perhaps like me, General Alexander

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.770
didn't see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.881
I think he saw untapped potential.

00:14:23.881 --> 00:14:27.254
In fact, he was there to give a hiring pitch.

00:14:27.254 --> 00:14:29.894
"In this room right here," he said,

00:14:29.894 --> 00:14:32.284
"is the talent our nation needs."

00:14:32.284 --> 00:14:35.664
Well, hackers in the back row replied,

00:14:35.664 --> 00:14:37.790
"Then stop arresting us."

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.224
(Applause)

00:14:41.224 --> 00:14:43.803
Indeed, for years,

00:14:43.803 --> 00:14:46.619
hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence,

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:49.527
but in light of what we know now,

00:14:49.527 --> 00:14:53.800
who is more watchful of our online world?

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.806
The rules of the game are not that clear anymore,

00:14:56.806 --> 00:15:00.218
but hackers are perhaps the only ones

00:15:00.218 --> 00:15:04.101
still capable of challenging
overreaching governments

00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:06.316
and data-hoarding corporates

00:15:06.316 --> 00:15:08.794
on their own playing field.

00:15:08.794 --> 00:15:11.914
To me, that represents hope.

00:15:11.914 --> 00:15:13.238
For the past three decades,

00:15:13.238 --> 00:15:14.789
hackers have done a lot of things,

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:18.006
but they have also impacted civil liberties,

00:15:18.006 --> 00:15:20.376
innovation and Internet freedom,

00:15:20.376 --> 00:15:23.305
so I think it's time we take a good look

00:15:23.305 --> 00:15:25.435
at how we choose to portray them,

00:15:25.435 --> 00:15:29.019
because if we keep expecting
them to be the bad guys,

00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:32.489
how can they be the heroes too?

00:15:32.489 --> 00:15:34.500
My years in the hacker world

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.142
have made me realize

00:15:36.142 --> 00:15:41.875
both the problem and the beauty about hackers:

00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:45.033
They just can't see something broken in the world

00:15:45.033 --> 00:15:46.680
and leave it be.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.360
They are compelled

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.890
to either exploit it or try and change it,

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:55.806
and so they find the vulnerable aspects

00:15:55.806 --> 00:15:57.940
in our rapidly changing world.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.282
They make us, they force us to fix things

00:16:02.282 --> 00:16:04.001
or demand something better,

00:16:04.001 --> 00:16:05.995
and I think we need them

00:16:05.995 --> 00:16:08.201
to do just that,

00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:11.470
because after all, it is not information

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.575
that wants to be free, it's us.

00:16:14.575 --> 00:16:17.937
Thank you very much.

00:16:17.937 --> 00:16:20.295
Thank you. (Applause)

00:16:20.295 --> 00:16:22.180
Hack the planet!
