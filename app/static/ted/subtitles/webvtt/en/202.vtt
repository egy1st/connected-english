00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:04.976
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do."

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.976
I don't have children.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.310
I borrow my friends' children, so --

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:12.548
(Laughter)

00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:14.976
take all this advice with a grain of salt.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:18.169
I'm Gever Tulley.

00:00:18.193 --> 00:00:22.753
I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade,

00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:26.674
but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School.

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:30.323
It's a summer program
which aims to help kids

00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:32.925
learn how to build the things
that they think of.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.838
So we build a lot of things,

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:38.982
and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.060
So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School,

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:45.468
they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody.

00:00:45.492 --> 00:00:46.766
(Laughter)

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:49.357
You know, we live in a world

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:53.316
that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.407
There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy

00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:01.364
child safety regulations can get.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.976
We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.634
manufactured in the United States,

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:10.237
or for sale with an item
in the United States.

00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:12.968
We put warnings on coffee cups

00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:15.719
to tell us that the contents may be hot.

00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:22.610
And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp

00:01:22.634 --> 00:01:24.690
for children under the age of 10.

00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:27.909
So where does this trend stop?

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:32.727
When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object,

00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:35.644
every pokey bit in the world,

00:01:35.668 --> 00:01:40.739
then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp,

00:01:40.763 --> 00:01:44.052
or not made out of round plastic,

00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:45.976
they'll hurt themselves with it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.304
So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone

00:01:52.328 --> 00:01:53.892
grow ever smaller,

00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:57.861
we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities

00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:00.477
to learn how to interact
with the world around them.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.231
And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions,

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:06.953
kids are always going to figure out

00:02:06.977 --> 00:02:09.032
how to do the most dangerous
thing they can,

00:02:09.056 --> 00:02:11.000
in whatever environment they can.

00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:12.416
(Laughter)

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.788
So despite the provocative title,

00:02:15.812 --> 00:02:18.565
this presentation is really about safety,

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:23.318
and about some simple things
that we can do

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:27.898
to raise our kids to be creative,

00:02:27.922 --> 00:02:31.613
confident and in control
of the environment around them.

00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:34.136
And what I now present to you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.406
is an excerpt from a book in progress.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.733
The book is called "50 Dangerous Things."

00:02:39.757 --> 00:02:41.976
This is "Five Dangerous Things."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.563
Thing number one: Play with fire.

00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:50.128
Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature

00:02:50.152 --> 00:02:54.277
is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history.

00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:56.252
Whether we remember it or not,

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:59.728
it's the first time we really get control

00:02:59.752 --> 00:03:01.976
of one of these mysterious things.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.241
These mysteries are only revealed

00:03:04.265 --> 00:03:06.646
to those who get the opportunity
to play with it.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.625
So, playing with fire.

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:14.975
This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire.

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:18.143
From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire,

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:21.976
about intake, combustion, exhaust.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.096
These are the three working
elements of fire

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.976
that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire.

00:03:27.317 --> 00:03:32.221
And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.260
You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it.

00:03:35.284 --> 00:03:39.707
Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me,

00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:41.533
they're going to learn things

00:03:41.557 --> 00:03:46.569
that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys.

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:48.291
(Laughter)

00:03:48.315 --> 00:03:50.577
Number two: Own a pocketknife.

00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:55.587
Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness,

00:03:55.611 --> 00:03:57.906
which I think is a terrible thing.

00:03:58.398 --> 00:04:01.861
(Laughter)

00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:05.757
Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool

00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:06.976
that you're given.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.976
You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.976
it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.588
And it's a powerful and empowering tool.

00:04:17.612 --> 00:04:20.416
And in a lot of cultures
they give knives --

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.971
like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives.

00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:26.569
These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber.

00:04:26.593 --> 00:04:30.561
I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10,

00:04:30.585 --> 00:04:32.823
and it left a lasting impression,

00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:34.976
to see babies playing with knives.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.976
And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.130
through a tool at a very young age.

00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:43.976
You lay down a couple
of very simple rules --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.562
always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it --

00:04:48.586 --> 00:04:51.552
and these are things kids
can understand and practice with.

00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:53.590
And yeah, they're going to cut themselves.

00:04:53.614 --> 00:04:56.725
I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself.

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:59.213
But you know, they're young.
They heal fast.

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:02.546
(Laughter)

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.821
Number three: Throw a spear.

00:05:05.444 --> 00:05:09.469
It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things,

00:05:09.493 --> 00:05:15.181
and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain,

00:05:15.205 --> 00:05:17.000
they tend to atrophy over time.

00:05:17.595 --> 00:05:20.800
But when you exercise them,

00:05:20.824 --> 00:05:23.381
any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system,

00:05:23.405 --> 00:05:25.268
and that applies to your brain, too.

00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:30.886
So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.873
the frontal and parietal lobes,

00:05:32.897 --> 00:05:38.252
which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding,

00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:41.823
and structural problem solving,

00:05:41.847 --> 00:05:46.871
so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability.

00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:52.976
And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.778
so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training.

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:04.915
These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.561
attention and concentration skills,

00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:09.224
so those are great.

00:06:09.248 --> 00:06:13.308
Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances.

00:06:14.064 --> 00:06:17.976
There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.904
Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance,

00:06:21.928 --> 00:06:23.085
don't throw it out.

00:06:23.109 --> 00:06:24.523
Take it apart with your kid,

00:06:24.547 --> 00:06:27.908
or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them.

00:06:27.932 --> 00:06:30.204
Even if you don't know what the parts are,

00:06:30.228 --> 00:06:32.792
puzzling out what they might be for

00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:36.266
is a really good practice for the kids

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.732
to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart,

00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:43.945
and no matter how complex they are,

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:46.089
they can understand parts of them.

00:06:46.113 --> 00:06:49.188
And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them.

00:06:49.212 --> 00:06:53.000
It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable.

00:06:53.443 --> 00:06:57.175
So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.976
are actually complex things
made by other people,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.558
and you can understand them.

00:07:03.137 --> 00:07:07.086
Number five: Two-parter.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.222
Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act.

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:11.532
(Laughter)

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:15.342
There are laws beyond safety regulations

00:07:15.366 --> 00:07:18.081
that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:20.501
that we own -- in this case,
digital media.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.135
It's a very simple exercise:

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:27.564
Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD,

00:07:27.588 --> 00:07:31.437
then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer.

00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:33.270
You've just broken a law.

00:07:33.294 --> 00:07:36.789
Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you.

00:07:36.813 --> 00:07:39.381
It's an important lesson
for kids to understand,

00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:42.881
that some of these laws
get broken by accident,

00:07:42.905 --> 00:07:45.255
and that laws have to be interpreted.

00:07:45.675 --> 00:07:48.025
That's something we often
talk about with the kids

00:07:48.049 --> 00:07:52.141
when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open,

00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:54.881
and taking them apart
and using them for other things.

00:07:54.905 --> 00:07:59.580
And also when we go out and drive a car.

00:08:00.755 --> 00:08:04.976
Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.976
so this is the alternate --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.675
(Laughter)

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:12.640
For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law,

00:08:12.664 --> 00:08:15.976
you can drive a car with your child.

00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:19.742
This is a great stage for a kid.

00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:21.643
This happens about the same time

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.996
that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs,

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.121
these big things in the outside world,

00:08:26.145 --> 00:08:28.121
that they're trying to get a grip on.

00:08:28.145 --> 00:08:32.899
A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it.

00:08:32.923 --> 00:08:37.268
And that really gives them
a handle on a world

00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:41.841
in a way that they don't often
have access to.

00:08:41.865 --> 00:08:43.495
And it's perfectly legal.

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:46.169
Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it,

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:49.976
and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.609
It's very safe actually.

00:08:51.633 --> 00:08:53.602
And it's fun for the whole family.

00:08:53.626 --> 00:08:57.246
(Laughter)

00:08:57.984 --> 00:09:01.000
Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.
