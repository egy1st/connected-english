00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:02.388
In the middle of my Ph.D.,

00:00:02.388 --> 00:00:05.850
I was hopelessly stuck.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.630
Every research direction that I tried

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.246
led to a dead end.

00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:11.148
It seemed like my basic assumptions

00:00:11.148 --> 00:00:13.076
just stopped working.

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:16.075
I felt like a pilot flying through the mist,

00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:18.870
and I lost all sense of direction.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.351
I stopped shaving.

00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:23.092
I couldn't get out of bed in the morning.

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:24.825
I felt unworthy

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:27.978
of stepping across the gates of the university,

00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:30.126
because I wasn't like Einstein or Newton

00:00:30.126 --> 00:00:32.279
or any other scientist whose results

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.810
I had learned about, because in science,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.192
we just learn about the results, not the process.

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:41.893
And so obviously, I couldn't be a scientist.

00:00:41.893 --> 00:00:43.557
But I had enough support

00:00:43.557 --> 00:00:44.954
and I made it through

00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:47.174
and discovered something new about nature.

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:49.917
This is an amazing feeling of calmness,

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:51.249
being the only person in the world

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.474
who knows a new law of nature.

00:00:53.474 --> 00:00:56.516
And I started the second project in my Ph.D,

00:00:56.516 --> 00:00:57.880
and it happened again.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.169
I got stuck and I made it through.

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:01.555
And I started thinking,

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:02.712
maybe there's a pattern here.

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:04.553
I asked the other graduate students, and they said,

00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:06.596
"Yeah, that's exactly what happened to us,

00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:08.945
except nobody told us about it."

00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:10.895
We'd all studied science as if it's a series

00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:14.471
of logical steps between question and answer,

00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:17.217
but doing research is nothing like that.

00:01:17.217 --> 00:01:19.551
At the same time, I was also studying

00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:21.638
to be an improvisation theater actor.

00:01:21.638 --> 00:01:23.072
So physics by day,

00:01:23.072 --> 00:01:25.090
and by night, laughing, jumping, singing,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.402
playing my guitar.

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:27.881
Improvisation theater,

00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:30.890
just like science, goes into the unknown,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.302
because you have to make a scene onstage

00:01:32.302 --> 00:01:34.005
without a director, without a script,

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.283
without having any idea what you'll portray

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:38.689
or what the other characters will do.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.538
But unlike science,

00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:43.561
in improvisation theater, they tell you from day one

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.776
what's going to happen to
you when you get onstage.

00:01:45.776 --> 00:01:48.548
You're going to fail miserably.

00:01:48.548 --> 00:01:49.725
You're going to get stuck.

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:51.843
And we would practice staying creative

00:01:51.843 --> 00:01:53.046
inside that stuck place.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.951
For example, we had an exercise

00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:56.093
where we all stood in a circle,

00:01:56.093 --> 00:01:59.058
and each person had to do
the world's worst tap dance,

00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:00.644
and everybody else applauded

00:02:00.644 --> 00:02:01.886
and cheered you on,

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:04.649
supporting you onstage.

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.557
When I became a professor

00:02:06.557 --> 00:02:07.938
and had to guide my own students

00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:09.911
through their research projects,

00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:11.278
I realized again,

00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:12.990
I don't know what to do.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.984
I'd studied thousands of hours of physics,

00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:16.598
biology, chemistry,

00:02:16.598 --> 00:02:18.970
but not one hour, not one concept

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.556
on how to mentor, how to guide someone

00:02:21.556 --> 00:02:23.293
to go together into the unknown,

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:25.214
about motivation.

00:02:25.214 --> 00:02:27.144
So I turned to improvisation theater,

00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:29.317
and I told my students from day one

00:02:29.317 --> 00:02:32.218
what's going to happen when you start research,

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:33.944
and this has to do with our mental schema

00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:35.956
of what research will be like.

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:38.234
Because you see, whenever people do anything,

00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:40.876
for example if I want to touch this blackboard,

00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:42.536
my brain first builds up a schema,

00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:44.395
a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do

00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:46.551
before I even start moving my hand,

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.399
and if I get blocked,

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:50.274
if my schema doesn't match reality,

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:52.558
that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance.

00:02:52.558 --> 00:02:55.467
That's why your schemas had better match reality.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.622
But if you believe the way science is taught,

00:02:58.622 --> 00:03:00.519
and if you believe textbooks, you're liable

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.813
to have the following schema of research.

00:03:06.813 --> 00:03:10.131
If A is the question,

00:03:10.131 --> 00:03:13.531
and B is the answer,

00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:18.124
then research is a direct path.

00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:21.242
The problem is that if an experiment doesn't work,

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:24.904
or a student gets depressed,

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.990
it's perceived as something utterly wrong

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.020
and causes tremendous stress.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.803
And that's why I teach my students

00:03:31.803 --> 00:03:35.665
a more realistic schema.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.384
Here's an example

00:03:40.384 --> 00:03:43.520
where things don't match your schema.

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.641
(Laughter)

00:03:49.641 --> 00:03:52.840
(Applause)

00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:05.010
So I teach my students a different schema.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.204
If A is the question,

00:04:07.204 --> 00:04:09.385
B is the answer,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.855
stay creative in the cloud,

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:16.830
and you start going,

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.193
and experiments don't work, experiments don't work,

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:21.728
experiments don't work, experiments don't work,

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.404
until you reach a place linked
with negative emotions

00:04:24.404 --> 00:04:26.682
where it seems like your basic assumptions

00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:27.798
have stopped making sense,

00:04:27.798 --> 00:04:30.853
like somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet.

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:34.181
And I call this place the cloud.

00:04:47.685 --> 00:04:50.363
Now you can be lost in the cloud

00:04:50.363 --> 00:04:52.871
for a day, a week, a month, a year,

00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:54.369
a whole career,

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:56.531
but sometimes, if you're lucky enough

00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:58.387
and you have enough support,

00:04:58.387 --> 00:05:00.377
you can see in the materials at hand,

00:05:00.377 --> 00:05:03.625
or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud,

00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:05.627
a new answer,

00:05:07.285 --> 00:05:10.969
C, and you decide to go for it.

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.338
And experiments don't work, experiments don't work,

00:05:13.338 --> 00:05:14.807
but you get there,

00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:16.027
and then you tell everyone about it

00:05:16.027 --> 00:05:19.529
by publishing a paper that reads A arrow C,

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.488
which is a great way to communicate,

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.832
but as long as you don't forget the path

00:05:23.832 --> 00:05:25.631
that brought you there.

00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:27.606
Now this cloud is an inherent part

00:05:27.606 --> 00:05:30.210
of research, an inherent part of our craft,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.420
because the cloud stands guard at the boundary.

00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:39.990
It stands guard at the boundary

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.962
between the known

00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:49.399
and the unknown,

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.385
because in order to discover something truly new,

00:05:55.385 --> 00:05:58.962
at least one of your basic
assumptions has to change,

00:05:58.962 --> 00:06:00.216
and that means that in science,

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:02.178
we do something quite heroic.

00:06:02.178 --> 00:06:03.999
Every day, we try to bring ourselves

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:05.811
to the boundary between
the known and the unknown

00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:07.632
and face the cloud.

00:06:07.632 --> 00:06:09.337
Now notice that I put B

00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:10.080
in the land of the known,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.891
because we knew about it in the beginning,

00:06:11.891 --> 00:06:15.540
but C is always more interesting

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.263
and more important than B.

00:06:18.263 --> 00:06:20.456
So B is essential in order to get going,

00:06:20.456 --> 00:06:22.274
but C is much more profound,

00:06:22.274 --> 00:06:26.771
and that's the amazing thing about resesarch.

00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:28.959
Now just knowing that word, the cloud,

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:31.514
has been transformational in my research group,

00:06:31.514 --> 00:06:33.384
because students come to me and say,

00:06:33.384 --> 00:06:34.982
"Uri, I'm in the cloud,"

00:06:34.982 --> 00:06:38.148
and I say, "Great, you must be feeling miserable."

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:40.290
(Laughter)

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.203
But I'm kind of happy,

00:06:42.203 --> 00:06:43.881
because we might be close to the boundary

00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:45.777
between the known and the unknown,

00:06:45.777 --> 00:06:47.323
and we stand a chance of discovering

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.184
something truly new,

00:06:49.184 --> 00:06:50.526
since the way our mind works,

00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:53.674
it's just knowing that the cloud

00:06:53.674 --> 00:06:58.100
is normal, it's essential,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.305
and in fact beautiful,

00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:02.928
we can join the Cloud Appreciation Society,

00:07:02.928 --> 00:07:04.846
and it detoxifies the feeling that something

00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:07.408
is deeply wrong with me.

00:07:07.408 --> 00:07:09.858
And as a mentor, I know what to do,

00:07:09.858 --> 00:07:12.060
which is to step up my support for the student,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.541
because research in psychology shows

00:07:13.541 --> 00:07:17.100
that if you're feeling fear and despair,

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.097
your mind narrows down

00:07:18.097 --> 00:07:20.928
to very safe and conservative ways of thinking.

00:07:20.928 --> 00:07:22.503
If you'd like to explore the risky paths

00:07:22.503 --> 00:07:23.891
needed to get out of the cloud,

00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:25.652
you need other emotions --

00:07:25.652 --> 00:07:27.853
solidarity, support, hope —

00:07:27.853 --> 00:07:29.590
that come with your connection from somebody else,

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.140
so like in improvisation theater,

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.441
in science, it's best to walk into the unknown

00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:35.410
together.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.852
So knowing about the cloud,

00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:41.176
you also learn from improvisation theater

00:07:41.176 --> 00:07:43.778
a very effective way to have conversations

00:07:43.778 --> 00:07:45.538
inside the cloud.

00:07:45.538 --> 00:07:47.515
It's based on the central principle

00:07:47.515 --> 00:07:49.282
of improvisation theater,

00:07:49.282 --> 00:07:50.375
so here improvisation theater

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:51.671
came to my help again.

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:53.962
It's called saying "Yes, and"

00:07:53.962 --> 00:07:57.427
to the offers made by other actors.

00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:07.191
That means accepting the offers

00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:09.702
and building on them, saying, "Yes, and."

00:08:09.702 --> 00:08:10.941
For example, if one actor says,

00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:12.096
"Here is a pool of water,"

00:08:12.096 --> 00:08:13.141
and the other actor says,

00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:15.010
"No, that's just a stage,"

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.748
the improvisation is over.

00:08:16.748 --> 00:08:20.520
It's dead, and everybody feels frustrated.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.868
That's called blocking.

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.475
If you're not mindful of communications,

00:08:23.475 --> 00:08:26.412
scientific conversations can have a lot of blocking.

00:08:26.412 --> 00:08:28.648
Saying "Yes, and" sounds like this.

00:08:28.648 --> 00:08:31.156
"Here is a pool of water."
"Yeah, let's jump in."

00:08:31.156 --> 00:08:34.165
"Look, there's a whale! Let's grab it by its tail.

00:08:34.165 --> 00:08:36.266
It's pulling us to the moon!"

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:39.286
So saying "Yes, and" bypasses our inner critic.

00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:40.980
We all have an inner critic

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.221
that kind of guards what we say,

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:44.144
so people don't think that we're obscene

00:08:44.144 --> 00:08:45.259
or crazy or unoriginal,

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:46.519
and science is full of the fear

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:48.076
of appearing unoriginal.

00:08:48.076 --> 00:08:50.243
Saying "Yes, and" bypasses the critic

00:08:50.243 --> 00:08:52.855
and unlocks hidden voices of creativity

00:08:52.855 --> 00:08:54.380
you didn't even know that you had,

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.410
and they often carry the answer

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.815
about the cloud.

00:08:58.815 --> 00:09:01.416
So you see, knowing about the cloud

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:02.820
and about saying "Yes, and"

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.679
made my lab very creative.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:08.207
Students started playing off of each others' ideas,

00:09:08.207 --> 00:09:10.321
and we made surprising discoveries

00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:13.190
in the interface between physics and biology.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.140
For example, we were stuck for a year

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.289
trying to understand the intricate

00:09:17.289 --> 00:09:19.982
biochemical networks inside our cells,

00:09:19.982 --> 00:09:22.439
and we said, "We are deeply in the cloud,"

00:09:22.439 --> 00:09:24.419
and we had a playful conversation

00:09:24.419 --> 00:09:26.207
where my student Shai Shen Orr said,

00:09:26.207 --> 00:09:29.050
"Let's just draw this on a
piece of paper, this network,"

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.503
and instead of saying,

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.654
"But we've done that so many times

00:09:32.654 --> 00:09:33.688
and it doesn't work,"

00:09:33.688 --> 00:09:36.631
I said, "Yes, and

00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:38.672
let's use a very big piece of paper,"

00:09:38.672 --> 00:09:39.764
and then Ron Milo said,

00:09:39.764 --> 00:09:41.984
"Let's use a gigantic architect's

00:09:41.984 --> 00:09:43.780
blueprint kind of paper, and I know where to print it,"

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.280
and we printed out the network and looked at it,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.789
and that's where we made
our most important discovery,

00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:50.990
that this complicated network is just made

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.453
of a handful of simple, repeating interaction patterns

00:09:54.453 --> 00:09:57.616
like motifs in a stained glass window.

00:09:57.616 --> 00:09:59.664
We call them network motifs,

00:09:59.664 --> 00:10:01.816
and they're the elementary circuits

00:10:01.816 --> 00:10:03.201
that help us understand

00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:05.901
the logic of the way cells make decisions

00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:08.750
in all organisms, including our body.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.675
Soon enough, after this,

00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:12.295
I started being invited to give talks

00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:15.306
to thousands of scientists across the world,

00:10:15.306 --> 00:10:17.139
but the knowledge about the cloud

00:10:17.139 --> 00:10:18.271
and saying "Yes, and"

00:10:18.271 --> 00:10:20.110
just stayed within my own lab,

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.241
because you see, in science,
we don't talk about the process,

00:10:22.241 --> 00:10:24.674
anything subjective or emotional.

00:10:24.674 --> 00:10:26.537
We talk about the results.

00:10:26.537 --> 00:10:28.606
So there was no way to talk about it in conferences.

00:10:28.606 --> 00:10:30.530
That was unthinkable.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.606
And I saw scientists in other groups get stuck

00:10:32.606 --> 00:10:34.380
without even having a word to describe

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.701
what they're seeing,

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:37.056
and their ways of thinking

00:10:37.056 --> 00:10:38.584
narrowed down to very safe paths,

00:10:38.584 --> 00:10:40.244
their science didn't reach its full potential,

00:10:40.244 --> 00:10:41.997
and they were miserable.

00:10:41.997 --> 00:10:43.936
I thought, that's the way it is.

00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:45.957
I'll try to make my lab as creative as possible,

00:10:45.957 --> 00:10:47.637
and if everybody else does the same,

00:10:47.637 --> 00:10:49.827
science will eventually become

00:10:49.827 --> 00:10:52.041
more and more better and better.

00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:54.961
That way of thinking got turned on its head

00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:57.300
when by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.658
give a talk about her experiences

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.349
as a woman in science.

00:11:00.349 --> 00:11:02.172
And she asked,

00:11:02.172 --> 00:11:04.120
"Why is it that we don't talk about the subjective

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.306
and emotional aspects of doing science?

00:11:06.306 --> 00:11:10.298
It's not by chance. It's a matter of values."

00:11:10.298 --> 00:11:12.476
You see, science seeks knowledge

00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:14.271
that's objective and rational.

00:11:14.271 --> 00:11:16.469
That's the beautiful thing about science.

00:11:16.469 --> 00:11:18.425
But we also have a cultural myth

00:11:18.425 --> 00:11:19.679
that the doing of science,

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.979
what we do every day to get that knowledge,

00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:24.419
is also only objective and rational,

00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:26.851
like Mr. Spock.

00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:28.265
And when you label something

00:11:28.265 --> 00:11:30.078
as objective and rational,

00:11:30.078 --> 00:11:31.720
automatically, the other side,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.177
the subjective and emotional,

00:11:33.177 --> 00:11:35.279
become labeled as non-science

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:37.250
or anti-science or threatening to science,

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.061
and we just don't talk about it.

00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:41.015
And when I heard that,

00:11:41.015 --> 00:11:43.182
that science has a culture,

00:11:43.182 --> 00:11:44.729
everything clicked into place for me,

00:11:44.729 --> 00:11:46.393
because if science has a culture,

00:11:46.393 --> 00:11:47.649
culture can be changed,

00:11:47.649 --> 00:11:49.242
and I can be a change agent

00:11:49.242 --> 00:11:51.954
working to change the culture
of science wherever I could.

00:11:51.954 --> 00:11:55.023
And so the very next lecture I gave in a conference,

00:11:55.023 --> 00:11:56.635
I talked about my science,

00:11:56.635 --> 00:11:58.147
and then I talked about the importance

00:11:58.147 --> 00:12:00.329
of the subjective and emotional
aspects of doing science

00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:01.449
and how we should talk about them,

00:12:01.449 --> 00:12:02.683
and I looked at the audience,

00:12:02.683 --> 00:12:05.043
and they were cold.

00:12:05.043 --> 00:12:08.334
They couldn't hear what I was saying

00:12:08.334 --> 00:12:09.585
in the context of a 10 back-to-back

00:12:09.585 --> 00:12:11.424
PowerPoint presentation conference.

00:12:11.424 --> 00:12:13.906
And I tried again and again,
conference after conference,

00:12:13.906 --> 00:12:16.279
but I wasn't getting through.

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:19.185
I was in the cloud.

00:12:19.185 --> 00:12:22.699
And eventually I managed to get out the cloud

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:25.510
using improvisation and music.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.249
Since then, every conference I go to,

00:12:28.249 --> 00:12:31.111
I give a science talk and a second, special talk

00:12:31.111 --> 00:12:33.104
called "Love and fear in the lab,"

00:12:33.104 --> 00:12:35.321
and I start it off by doing a song

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:37.893
about scientists' greatest fear,

00:12:37.893 --> 00:12:40.805
which is that we work hard,

00:12:40.805 --> 00:12:43.147
we discover something new,

00:12:43.147 --> 00:12:46.504
and somebody else publishes it before we do.

00:12:46.504 --> 00:12:49.120
We call it being scooped,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.334
and being scooped feels horrible.

00:12:52.334 --> 00:12:54.547
It makes us afraid to talk to each other,

00:12:54.547 --> 00:12:55.380
which is no fun,

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.140
because we came to science to share our ideas

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.451
and to learn from each other,

00:12:59.451 --> 00:13:02.940
and so I do a blues song,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.544
which — (Applause) —

00:13:10.544 --> 00:13:13.767
called "Scooped Again,"

00:13:13.767 --> 00:13:16.425
and I ask the audience to be my backup singers,

00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:20.405
and I tell them, "Your text is 'Scoop, Scoop.'"

00:13:20.405 --> 00:13:23.050
It sounds like this: "Scoop, scoop!"

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.013
Sounds like this.

00:13:24.013 --> 00:13:26.232
♪ I've been scooped again ♪

00:13:26.232 --> 00:13:27.975
♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪

00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:29.253
And then we go for it.

00:13:29.253 --> 00:13:31.298
♪ I've been scooped again ♪

00:13:31.298 --> 00:13:32.584
♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪

00:13:32.584 --> 00:13:34.479
♪ I've been scooped again ♪

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:35.785
♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪

00:13:35.785 --> 00:13:37.568
♪ I've been scooped again ♪

00:13:37.568 --> 00:13:39.207
♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪

00:13:39.207 --> 00:13:40.875
♪ I've been scooped again ♪

00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:42.637
♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪

00:13:42.637 --> 00:13:45.912
♪ Oh mama, can't you feel my pain ♪

00:13:45.912 --> 00:13:49.698
♪ Heavens help me, I've been scooped again ♪

00:13:50.925 --> 00:13:57.316
(Applause)

00:13:57.735 --> 00:13:58.965
Thank you.

00:13:58.965 --> 00:14:00.464
Thank you for your backup singing.

00:14:00.464 --> 00:14:02.548
So everybody starts laughing, starts breathing,

00:14:02.548 --> 00:14:04.560
notices that there's other scientists around them

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.867
with shared issues,

00:14:05.867 --> 00:14:07.672
and we start talking about the emotional

00:14:07.672 --> 00:14:09.522
and subjective things that go on in research.

00:14:09.522 --> 00:14:11.706
It feels like a huge taboo has been lifted.

00:14:11.706 --> 00:14:14.505
Finally, we can talk about
this in a scientific conference.

00:14:14.505 --> 00:14:16.691
And scientists have gone on to form peer groups

00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:18.301
where they meet regularly

00:14:18.301 --> 00:14:19.930
and create a space to talk about the emotional

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.231
and subjective things that
happen as they're mentoring,

00:14:22.231 --> 00:14:23.594
as they're going into the unknown,

00:14:23.594 --> 00:14:25.164
and even started courses

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:26.839
about the process of doing science,

00:14:26.839 --> 00:14:28.734
about going into the unknown together,

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:30.150
and many other things.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.484
So my vision is that,

00:14:31.484 --> 00:14:34.946
just like every scientist knows the word "atom,"

00:14:34.946 --> 00:14:36.913
that matter is made out of atoms,

00:14:36.913 --> 00:14:38.397
every scientist would know the words

00:14:38.397 --> 00:14:40.741
like "the cloud," saying "Yes, and,"

00:14:40.741 --> 00:14:43.820
and science will become much more creative,

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.824
make many, many more unexpected discoveries

00:14:46.824 --> 00:14:49.360
for the benefit of us all,

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.576
and would also be much more playful.

00:14:51.576 --> 00:14:54.166
And what I might ask you to remember from this talk

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:56.862
is that next time you face

00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:58.588
a problem you can't solve

00:14:58.588 --> 00:15:01.180
in work or in life,

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.056
there's a word for what you're going to see:

00:15:03.056 --> 00:15:04.233
the cloud.

00:15:04.233 --> 00:15:05.766
And you can go through the cloud

00:15:05.766 --> 00:15:07.174
not alone but together

00:15:07.174 --> 00:15:09.212
with someone who is your source of support

00:15:09.212 --> 00:15:11.260
to say "Yes, and" to your ideas,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.577
to help you say "Yes, and" to your own ideas,

00:15:13.577 --> 00:15:15.464
to increase the chance that,

00:15:15.464 --> 00:15:17.190
through the wisps of the cloud,

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.688
you'll find that moment of calmness

00:15:18.688 --> 00:15:20.491
where you get your first glimpse

00:15:20.491 --> 00:15:23.741
of your unexpected discovery,

00:15:23.741 --> 00:15:26.465
your C.

00:15:26.465 --> 00:15:28.785
Thank you.

00:15:28.785 --> 00:15:32.785
(Applause)
