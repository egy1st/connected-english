00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:02.673
Six months ago, I got an email

00:00:02.673 --> 00:00:04.080
from a man in Israel

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.461
who had read one of my books,

00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:06.964
and the email said,

00:00:06.964 --> 00:00:08.971
"You don't know me,

00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:11.443
but I'm your 12th cousin."

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:13.820
And it said, "I have a family tree

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.724
with 80,000 people on it, including you,

00:00:17.724 --> 00:00:18.878
Karl Marx,

00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:21.478
and several European aristocrats."

00:00:21.478 --> 00:00:23.880
Now I did not know what to make of this.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.231
Part of me was like, okay,

00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:28.191
when's he going to ask me to wire

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:31.888
10,000 dollars to his Nigerian bank, right?

00:00:31.888 --> 00:00:35.561
I also thought, 80,000 relatives,

00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:36.854
do I want that?

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:38.672
I have enough trouble with some of the ones

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.109
I have already.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.775
And I won't name names, but you know who you are.

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:47.024
But another part of me said, this is remarkable.

00:00:47.024 --> 00:00:49.760
Here I am alone in my office, but I'm not alone at all.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.320
I'm connected to 80,000 people around the world,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.697
and that's four Madison Square Gardens

00:00:56.697 --> 00:00:58.412
full of cousins.

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:01.349
And some of them are going to be great,

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:03.679
and some of them are going to be irritating,

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.495
but they're all related to me.

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:10.366
So this email inspired me to dive into genealogy,

00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:13.766
which I always thought was
a very staid and proper field,

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.691
but it turns out it's going through a fascinating

00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:19.184
revolution, and a controversial one.

00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:22.950
Partly, this is because of DNA and genetic testing,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.900
but partly, it's because of the Internet.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.660
There are sites that now take

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.827
the Wikipedia approach to family trees,

00:01:31.827 --> 00:01:34.180
collaboration and crowdsourcing,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.358
and what you do is,

00:01:35.358 --> 00:01:38.240
you load your family tree on,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.720
and then these sites search

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.402
to see if the A.J. Jacobs in your tree

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.882
is the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree,

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:48.115
and if it is, then you can combine,

00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:50.010
and then you combine and combine and combine

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.911
until you get these massive,

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.761
mega-family trees

00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.262
with thousands of people on them,

00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:57.677
or even millions.

00:01:57.677 --> 00:02:00.004
I'm on something on Geni called

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:01.930
the world family tree,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.487
which has no less than a jaw-dropping

00:02:04.487 --> 00:02:08.017
75 million people.

00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:11.857
So that's 75 million people connected by blood

00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:14.337
or marriage, sometimes both.

00:02:14.337 --> 00:02:16.904
(Laughter)

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:21.089
It's in all seven continents, including Antarctica.

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:23.466
I'm on it. Many of you are on it,

00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:25.170
whether you know it or not,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.634
and you can see the links.

00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:32.226
Here's my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow.

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:34.109
She has no idea I exist,

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.800
but we are officially cousins.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.996
We have just 17 links between us.

00:02:40.996 --> 00:02:43.689
And there's my cousin Barack Obama.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:44.881
(Laughter)

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:48.506
And he is my aunt's fifth great-aunt's husband's

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:52.014
father's wife's seventh great-nephew,

00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:57.079
so practically my old brother.

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.602
And my cousin, of course,

00:02:58.602 --> 00:02:59.919
the actor Kevin Bacon --

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.571
(Laughter) —

00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:04.535
who is my first cousin's twice removed's

00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:06.927
wife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed's

00:03:06.927 --> 00:03:08.137
niece's husband.

00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:10.272
So six degrees of Kevin Bacon,

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:14.391
plus or minus several degrees.

00:03:14.391 --> 00:03:16.772
Now, I'm not boasting, because all of you

00:03:16.772 --> 00:03:19.000
have famous people and historical figures

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.667
in your tree, because we are all connected,

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:25.830
and 75 million may seem like a lot,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.556
but in a few years, it's quite likely

00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:30.069
we will have a family tree

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.820
with all, almost all, seven billion people on Earth.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.613
But does it really matter?

00:03:36.613 --> 00:03:37.955
What's the importance?

00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:39.633
And I do think it is important,

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:42.111
and I'll give you five reasons why, really quickly.

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:44.931
First, it's got scientific value.

00:03:44.931 --> 00:03:48.545
This is an unprecedented history of the human race,

00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:51.976
and it's giving us valuable data

00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:54.125
about how diseases are inherited,

00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:55.993
how people migrate,

00:03:55.993 --> 00:03:58.913
and there's a team of scientists at MIT right now

00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:01.593
studying the world family tree.

00:04:01.593 --> 00:04:04.479
Number two, it brings history alive.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.940
I found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.000
so I told my seven-year-old son that,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.846
and he was totally engaged.

00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:16.213
Now Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy

00:04:16.213 --> 00:04:17.423
with weird hair.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:21.580
He's Uncle Albert. (Laughter)

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.140
And my son wanted to know,

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.297
"What did he say? What is E = MC squared?"

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:27.356
Also, it's not all good news.

00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:31.343
I found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer,

00:04:31.343 --> 00:04:33.960
but I will say that's on my wife's side.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.648
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:36.648 --> 00:04:39.243
So I want to make that clear. Sorry, honey.

00:04:39.243 --> 00:04:42.132
Number three, interconnectedness.

00:04:42.132 --> 00:04:45.495
We all come from the same ancestor,

00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:48.063
and you don't have to believe
the literal Bible version,

00:04:48.063 --> 00:04:52.151
but scientists talk about Y chromosomal Adam

00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:55.004
and mitochondrial Eve,

00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:58.320
and these were about 100,000 to 300,000 years ago.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.373
We all have a bit of their DNA in us.

00:05:01.373 --> 00:05:04.190
They are our great-great-great-great-great-great --

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.930
continue that for about 7,000 times --

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.745
grandparents,

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:11.391
and so that means we literally all are

00:05:11.391 --> 00:05:13.546
biological cousins as well,

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:16.102
and estimates vary, but probably

00:05:16.102 --> 00:05:18.804
the farthest cousin you have on Earth

00:05:18.804 --> 00:05:21.259
is about a 50th cousin.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.440
Now, it's not just ancestors we share, descendants.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.140
If you have kids, and they have kids,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.605
look how quickly the descendants accumulate.

00:05:31.605 --> 00:05:33.298
So in 10, 12 generations,

00:05:33.298 --> 00:05:35.429
you're going to have thousands of offspring,

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:36.946
and millions of offspring.

00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:38.935
Number four, a kinder world.

00:05:38.935 --> 00:05:41.424
Now, I know that there are family feuds.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.719
I have three sons, so I see how they fight.

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.385
But I think that there's also a human bias

00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:48.911
to treat your family a little better than strangers.

00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:52.735
I think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots,

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:56.160
because they're going to have to realize

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.770
that they are cousins with thousands of people

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.521
in whatever ethnic group they happen

00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:03.783
to have issues with,

00:06:03.783 --> 00:06:05.668
and I think you look back at history,

00:06:05.668 --> 00:06:08.669
and a lot of the terrible things
we've done to each other

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.575
is because one group thinks
another group is sub-human,

00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:13.040
and you can't do that anymore.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.410
We're not just part of the same species.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.177
We're part of the same family.

00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:19.813
We share 99.9 percent of our DNA.

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:22.114
Now the final one is number five,

00:06:22.114 --> 00:06:23.793
a democratizing effect.

00:06:23.793 --> 00:06:27.250
Some genealogy has an elitist strain,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.240
like people say, "Oh, I'm descended

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.511
from Mary Queen of Scots

00:06:30.511 --> 00:06:33.718
and you're not, so you cannot join my country club."

00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:36.659
But that's really going to be hard to do now,

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.090
because everyone is related.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.778
I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots --

00:06:40.778 --> 00:06:44.131
by marriage, but still.

00:06:44.131 --> 00:06:47.627
So it's really a fascinating time

00:06:47.627 --> 00:06:49.183
in the history of family,

00:06:49.183 --> 00:06:52.690
because it's changing so fast.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.265
There is gay marriage and sperm donors

00:06:55.265 --> 00:07:00.185
and there's intermarriage
on an unprecedented scale,

00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:02.411
and this makes some of my
more conservative cousins

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:04.020
a little nervous,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.824
but I actually think it's a good thing.

00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:09.653
I think the more inclusive the idea of family is,

00:07:09.653 --> 00:07:10.680
the better,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.784
because then you have more potential caretakers,

00:07:12.784 --> 00:07:17.099
and as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:19.226
Hillary Clinton says --

00:07:19.226 --> 00:07:20.970
(Laughter) —

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.299
it takes a village.

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:27.562
So I have all these hundreds and thousands,

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:28.680
millions of new cousins.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.421
I thought, what can I do with this information?

00:07:31.421 --> 00:07:33.277
And that's when I decided,

00:07:33.277 --> 00:07:35.516
why not throw a party?

00:07:35.516 --> 00:07:37.752
So that's what I'm doing.

00:07:37.752 --> 00:07:40.312
And you're all invited.

00:07:40.312 --> 00:07:42.210
Next year, next summer,

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.141
I will be hosting what I hope is

00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:48.619
the biggest and best family reunion in history.

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:49.651
(Applause)

00:07:49.651 --> 00:07:52.053
Thank you. I want you there.

00:07:52.053 --> 00:07:53.165
I want you there.

00:07:53.165 --> 00:07:55.639
It's going to be at the New York Hall of Science,

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:57.921
which is a great venue,

00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:01.701
but it's also on the site of the former World's Fair,

00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:05.346
which is, I think, very appropriate,

00:08:05.346 --> 00:08:07.576
because I see this as a family reunion

00:08:07.576 --> 00:08:08.994
meets a world's fair.

00:08:08.994 --> 00:08:11.935
There's going to be exhibits and food, music.

00:08:11.935 --> 00:08:14.244
Paul McCartney is 11 steps away,

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:17.844
so I'm hoping he brings his guitar.

00:08:17.844 --> 00:08:20.579
He hasn't RSVP'd yet, but fingers crossed.

00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:22.970
And there is going to be a day of speakers,

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.971
of fascinating cousins.

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:26.153
It's early, but I've already,

00:08:26.153 --> 00:08:28.025
I've got some lined up.

00:08:28.025 --> 00:08:30.749
Cass Sunstein, my cousin who is perhaps

00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:33.137
the most brilliant legal scholar, will be talking.

00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:36.376
He was a former member
of the Obama administration.

00:08:36.376 --> 00:08:39.200
And on the other side of the political spectrum,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.332
George H.W. Bush, number 41, the father,

00:08:42.332 --> 00:08:44.187
he has agreed to participate,

00:08:44.187 --> 00:08:46.623
and Nick Kroll, the comedian,

00:08:46.623 --> 00:08:50.122
and Dr. Oz, and many more to come.

00:08:50.122 --> 00:08:54.520
And, of course, the most important is that you,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.466
I want you guys there,

00:08:56.466 --> 00:08:59.901
and I invite you to go to GlobalFamilyReunion.org

00:08:59.901 --> 00:09:02.996
and figure out how you're on the family tree,

00:09:02.996 --> 00:09:07.189
because these are big issues, family and tribe,

00:09:07.189 --> 00:09:09.907
and I don't know all the answers,

00:09:09.907 --> 00:09:12.756
but I have a lot of smart relatives,

00:09:12.756 --> 00:09:14.337
including you guys,

00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:17.604
so together, I think we can figure it out.

00:09:17.604 --> 00:09:20.259
Only together can we solve these big problems.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:22.289
So from cousin to cousin,

00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:24.681
I thank you. I can't wait to see you.

00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:26.582
Goodbye.

00:09:26.582 --> 00:09:28.520
(Applause)
