00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:03.066
I need to start by telling you a little bit

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.555
about my social life,

00:00:04.555 --> 00:00:07.473
which I know may not seem relevant,

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:09.220
but it is.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.150
When people meet me at parties

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.342
and they find out that I'm an English professor

00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:15.739
who specializes in language,

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.189
they generally have one of two reactions.

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.378
One set of people look frightened. (Laughter)

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:25.971
They often say something like,

00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:29.277
"Oh, I'd better be careful what I say.

00:00:29.277 --> 00:00:32.495
I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make."

00:00:32.495 --> 00:00:36.553
And then they stop talking. (Laughter)

00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:38.950
And they wait for me to go away

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.187
and talk to someone else.

00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:43.222
The other set of people,

00:00:43.222 --> 00:00:45.647
their eyes light up,

00:00:45.647 --> 00:00:46.878
and they say,

00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:51.187
"You are just the person I want to talk to."

00:00:51.187 --> 00:00:53.607
And then they tell me about whatever it is

00:00:53.607 --> 00:00:56.142
they think is going wrong with the English language.

00:00:56.142 --> 00:00:58.511
(Laughter)

00:00:58.511 --> 00:01:00.828
A couple of weeks ago, I was at a dinner party

00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:03.065
and the man to my right

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:05.100
started telling me about all the ways

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.381
that the Internet is degrading the English language.

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:11.620
He brought up Facebook, and he said,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.470
"To defriend? I mean, is that even a real word?"

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.040
I want to pause on that question:

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.826
What makes a word real?

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:26.910
My dinner companion and I both know

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.077
what the verb "defriend" means,

00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:32.777
so when does a new word like "defriend"

00:01:32.777 --> 00:01:34.858
become real?

00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:37.362
Who has the authority to make those kinds

00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:40.780
of official decisions about words, anyway?

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.075
Those are the questions I want to talk about today.

00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:48.375
I think most people, when they say a word isn't real,

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.236
what they mean is, it doesn't appear

00:01:50.236 --> 00:01:51.864
in a standard dictionary.

00:01:51.864 --> 00:01:54.327
That, of course, raises a host of other questions,

00:01:54.327 --> 00:01:59.724
including, who writes dictionaries?

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:01.048
Before I go any further,

00:02:01.048 --> 00:02:03.490
let me clarify my role in all of this.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.998
I do not write dictionaries.

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:08.695
I do, however, collect new words

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:11.750
much the way dictionary editors do,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.573
and the great thing about being a historian

00:02:13.573 --> 00:02:14.640
of the English language

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.276
is that I get to call this "research."

00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:20.620
When I teach the history of the English language,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.377
I require that students teach me

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:26.903
two new slang words before I will begin class.

00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:29.220
Over the years, I have learned

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.454
some great new slang this way,

00:02:32.454 --> 00:02:36.492
including "hangry," which --

00:02:36.492 --> 00:02:40.188
(Applause) â€”

00:02:40.188 --> 00:02:42.535
which is when you are cranky or angry

00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:46.774
because you are hungry,

00:02:46.774 --> 00:02:51.550
and "adorkable,"

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.257
which is when you are adorable

00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:56.278
in kind of a dorky way,

00:02:56.278 --> 00:02:59.471
clearly, terrific words that fill

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:02.176
important gaps in the English language.

00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:06.389
(Laughter)

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.060
But how real are they

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.279
if we use them primarily as slang

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:15.396
and they don't yet appear in a dictionary?

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:18.213
With that, let's turn to dictionaries.

00:03:18.213 --> 00:03:20.053
I'm going to do this as a show of hands:

00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:22.387
How many of you still regularly

00:03:22.387 --> 00:03:25.515
refer to a dictionary, either print or online?

00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:29.532
Okay, so that looks like most of you.

00:03:29.532 --> 00:03:32.697
Now, a second question. Again, a show of hands:

00:03:32.697 --> 00:03:35.902
How many of you have ever looked to see

00:03:35.902 --> 00:03:38.791
who edited the dictionary you are using?

00:03:42.048 --> 00:03:45.680
Okay, many fewer.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.360
At some level, we know that there are human hands

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.936
behind dictionaries,

00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:55.207
but we're really not sure who those hands belong to.

00:03:55.207 --> 00:03:57.547
I'm actually fascinated by this.

00:03:57.547 --> 00:04:00.020
Even the most critical people out there

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.614
tend not to be very critical about dictionaries,

00:04:02.614 --> 00:04:04.497
not distinguishing among them

00:04:04.497 --> 00:04:06.568
and not asking a whole lot of questions

00:04:06.568 --> 00:04:08.791
about who edited them.

00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:10.414
Just think about the phrase

00:04:10.414 --> 00:04:12.890
"Look it up in the dictionary,"

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.567
which suggests that all dictionaries

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:16.273
are exactly the same.

00:04:16.273 --> 00:04:18.873
Consider the library here on campus,

00:04:18.873 --> 00:04:20.569
where you go into the reading room,

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.442
and there is a large, unabridged dictionary

00:04:23.442 --> 00:04:27.320
up on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.667
lying open so we can go stand before it

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:31.870
to get answers.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.176
Now, don't get me wrong,

00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:37.381
dictionaries are fantastic resources,

00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:38.930
but they are human

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.211
and they are not timeless.

00:04:41.211 --> 00:04:43.013
I'm struck as a teacher

00:04:43.013 --> 00:04:46.230
that we tell students to critically question

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.964
every text they read, every website they visit,

00:04:49.964 --> 00:04:51.452
except dictionaries,

00:04:51.452 --> 00:04:54.617
which we tend to treat as un-authored,

00:04:54.617 --> 00:04:57.259
as if they came from nowhere to give us answers

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.603
about what words really mean.

00:05:01.603 --> 00:05:05.200
Here's the thing: If you ask dictionary editors,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.358
what they'll tell you

00:05:06.358 --> 00:05:08.672
is they're just trying to keep up with us

00:05:08.672 --> 00:05:10.427
as we change the language.

00:05:10.427 --> 00:05:12.912
They're watching what we say and what we write

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:15.070
and trying to figure out what's going to stick

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.220
and what's not going to stick.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.537
They have to gamble,

00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:20.286
because they want to appear cutting edge

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.942
and catch the words that are going to make it,

00:05:22.942 --> 00:05:25.381
such as LOL,

00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:27.585
but they don't want to appear faddish

00:05:27.585 --> 00:05:30.127
and include the words that aren't going to make it,

00:05:30.127 --> 00:05:31.940
and I think a word that they're watching right now

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.359
is YOLO, you only live once.

00:05:37.317 --> 00:05:39.811
Now I get to hang out with dictionary editors,

00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:41.319
and you might be surprised

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.535
by one of the places where we hang out.

00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:45.672
Every January, we go

00:05:45.672 --> 00:05:48.825
to the American Dialect Society annual meeting,

00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:50.172
where among other things,

00:05:50.172 --> 00:05:53.930
we vote on the word of the year.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.933
There are about 200 or 300 people who come,

00:05:56.933 --> 00:05:59.373
some of the best known
linguists in the United States.

00:05:59.373 --> 00:06:01.231
To give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting,

00:06:01.231 --> 00:06:04.532
it occurs right before happy hour.

00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:06.608
Anyone who comes can vote.

00:06:06.608 --> 00:06:07.920
The most important rule is

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.049
that you can vote with only one hand.

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:14.513
In the past, some of the winners have been

00:06:14.513 --> 00:06:16.998
"tweet" in 2009

00:06:16.998 --> 00:06:20.403
and "hashtag" in 2012.

00:06:20.403 --> 00:06:23.462
"Chad" was the word of the year in the year 2000,

00:06:23.462 --> 00:06:27.282
because who knew what a chad was before 2000,

00:06:27.282 --> 00:06:31.696
and "WMD" in 2002.

00:06:31.696 --> 00:06:34.497
Now, we have other categories in which we vote too,

00:06:34.497 --> 00:06:36.090
and my favorite category

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.474
is most creative word of the year.

00:06:38.474 --> 00:06:41.224
Past winners in this category have included

00:06:41.224 --> 00:06:44.277
"recombobulation area,"

00:06:44.277 --> 00:06:48.080
which is at the Milwaukee Airport after security,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.640
where you can recombobulate.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.124
(Laughter)

00:06:52.124 --> 00:06:53.643
You can put your belt back on,

00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:56.104
put your computer back in your bag.

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.621
And then my all-time favorite word at this vote,

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:03.847
which is "multi-slacking."

00:07:03.847 --> 00:07:06.350
(Laughter)

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.633
And multi-slacking is the act

00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:11.501
of having multiple windows up on your screen

00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:12.902
so it looks like you're working

00:07:12.902 --> 00:07:14.996
when you're actually goofing around on the web.

00:07:14.996 --> 00:07:19.825
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:24.989
Will all of these words stick? Absolutely not.

00:07:24.989 --> 00:07:27.888
And we have made some questionable choices,

00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:29.565
for example in 2006

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:31.604
when the word of the year was "Plutoed,"

00:07:31.604 --> 00:07:33.596
to mean demoted.

00:07:33.596 --> 00:07:37.351
(Laughter)

00:07:38.586 --> 00:07:40.955
But some of the past winners

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:43.870
now seem completely unremarkable,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.388
such as "app"

00:07:45.388 --> 00:07:47.401
and "e" as a prefix,

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:50.360
and "google" as a verb.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.427
Now, a few weeks before our vote,

00:07:54.427 --> 00:07:56.208
Lake Superior State University

00:07:56.208 --> 00:08:00.987
issues its list of banished words for the year.

00:08:00.987 --> 00:08:02.920
What is striking about this

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.691
is that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap

00:08:05.691 --> 00:08:08.528
between their list and the list that we are considering

00:08:08.528 --> 00:08:10.778
for words of the year,

00:08:10.778 --> 00:08:14.870
and this is because we're noticing the same thing.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.900
We're noticing words that are coming into prominence.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.053
It's really a question of attitude.

00:08:20.053 --> 00:08:23.720
Are you bothered by language
fads and language change,

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.130
or do you find it fun, interesting,

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.484
something worthy of study

00:08:28.484 --> 00:08:31.369
as part of a living language?

00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:33.525
The list by Lake Superior State University

00:08:33.525 --> 00:08:36.170
continues a fairly long tradition in English

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.443
of complaints about new words.

00:08:38.443 --> 00:08:42.795
So here is Dean Henry Alford in 1875,

00:08:42.795 --> 00:08:45.041
who was very concerned that "desirability"

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:47.490
is really a terrible word.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.224
In 1760, Benjamin Franklin

00:08:50.224 --> 00:08:51.680
wrote a letter to David Hume

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.483
giving up the word "colonize" as bad.

00:08:55.483 --> 00:08:57.682
Over the years, we've also seen worries

00:08:57.682 --> 00:08:59.572
about new pronunciations.

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:02.620
Here is Samuel Rogers in 1855

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.219
who is concerned about some
fashionable pronunciations

00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:07.226
that he finds offensive,

00:09:07.226 --> 00:09:10.714
and he says "as if contemplate were not bad enough,

00:09:10.714 --> 00:09:13.132
balcony makes me sick."

00:09:13.132 --> 00:09:16.528
(Laughter)

00:09:16.528 --> 00:09:18.878
The word is borrowed in from Italian

00:09:18.878 --> 00:09:22.418
and it was pronounced bal-COE-nee.

00:09:22.418 --> 00:09:25.361
These complaints now strike us as quaint,

00:09:25.361 --> 00:09:30.306
if not downright adorkable -- (Laughter) --

00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:33.040
but here's the thing:

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.413
we still get quite worked up about language change.

00:09:37.413 --> 00:09:39.475
I have an entire file in my office

00:09:39.475 --> 00:09:42.537
of newspaper articles

00:09:42.537 --> 00:09:45.230
which express concern about illegitimate words

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.109
that should not have been included in the dictionary,

00:09:47.109 --> 00:09:48.557
including "LOL"

00:09:48.557 --> 00:09:50.627
when it got into the Oxford English Dictionary

00:09:50.627 --> 00:09:52.402
and "defriend"

00:09:52.402 --> 00:09:55.174
when it got into the Oxford American Dictionary.

00:09:55.174 --> 00:09:57.391
I also have articles expressing concern

00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:00.260
about "invite" as a noun,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.216
"impact" as a verb,

00:10:02.216 --> 00:10:05.187
because only teeth can be impacted,

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:08.162
and "incentivize" is described

00:10:08.162 --> 00:10:12.673
as "boorish, bureaucratic misspeak."

00:10:12.673 --> 00:10:14.634
Now, it's not that dictionary editors

00:10:14.634 --> 00:10:17.325
ignore these kinds of attitudes about language.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.880
They try to provide us some guidance about words

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.150
that are considered slang or informal

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.293
or offensive, often through usage labels,

00:10:25.293 --> 00:10:26.983
but they're in something of a bind,

00:10:26.983 --> 00:10:30.635
because they're trying to describe what we do,

00:10:30.635 --> 00:10:32.964
and they know that we often go to dictionaries

00:10:32.964 --> 00:10:35.732
to get information about how we should use a word

00:10:35.732 --> 00:10:37.640
well or appropriately.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.664
In response, the American Heritage Dictionaries

00:10:40.664 --> 00:10:42.805
include usage notes.

00:10:42.805 --> 00:10:44.922
Usage notes tend to occur with words

00:10:44.922 --> 00:10:46.245
that are troublesome in one way,

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:49.110
and one of the ways that they can be troublesome

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.043
is that they're changing meaning.

00:10:51.043 --> 00:10:54.469
Now usage notes involve very human decisions,

00:10:54.469 --> 00:10:56.528
and I think, as dictionary users,

00:10:56.528 --> 00:10:58.770
we're often not as aware of those human decisions

00:10:58.770 --> 00:10:59.869
as we should be.

00:10:59.869 --> 00:11:00.993
To show you what I mean,

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.710
we'll look at an example, but before we do,

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.692
I want to explain what the dictionary editors

00:11:05.692 --> 00:11:08.990
are trying to deal with in this usage note.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.664
Think about the word "peruse"

00:11:11.664 --> 00:11:15.302
and how you use that word.

00:11:15.302 --> 00:11:17.838
I would guess many of you are thinking

00:11:17.838 --> 00:11:22.375
of skim, scan, reading quickly.

00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:25.210
Some of you may even have some walking involved,

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.456
because you're perusing grocery store shelves,

00:11:27.456 --> 00:11:29.127
or something like that.

00:11:29.127 --> 00:11:31.611
You might be surprised to learn

00:11:31.611 --> 00:11:33.480
that if you look in most standard dictionaries,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.253
the first definition will be to read carefully,

00:11:36.253 --> 00:11:38.697
or pore over.

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:41.556
American Heritage has that as the first definition.

00:11:41.556 --> 00:11:44.521
They then have, as the second definition, skim,

00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:48.316
and next to that, they say "usage problem."

00:11:48.316 --> 00:11:50.226
(Laughter)

00:11:50.226 --> 00:11:52.314
And then they include a usage note,

00:11:52.314 --> 00:11:54.191
which is worth looking at.

00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:56.102
So here's the usage note:

00:11:56.102 --> 00:11:58.459
"Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly'...

00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:00.226
But the word is often used more loosely,

00:12:00.226 --> 00:12:02.386
to mean simply 'to read.'...

00:12:02.386 --> 00:12:05.315
Further extension of the word
to mean 'to glance over, skim,'

00:12:05.315 --> 00:12:07.771
has traditionally been considered an error,

00:12:07.771 --> 00:12:10.174
but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming

00:12:10.174 --> 00:12:11.870
somewhat more acceptable.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.269
When asked about the sentence,

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:16.000
'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly,'

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.075
66 percent of the [Usage] Panel

00:12:18.075 --> 00:12:20.422
found it unacceptable in 1988,

00:12:20.422 --> 00:12:22.529
58 percent in 1999,

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:26.397
and 48 percent in 2011."

00:12:26.397 --> 00:12:28.358
Ah, the Usage Panel,

00:12:28.358 --> 00:12:30.968
that trusted body of language authorities

00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:33.820
who is getting more lenient about this.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.890
Now, what I hope you're thinking right now is,

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.885
"Wait, who's on the Usage Panel?

00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:42.997
And what should I do with their pronouncements?"

00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:44.960
If you look in the front matter

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.068
of American Heritage Dictionaries,

00:12:46.068 --> 00:12:47.643
you can actually find the names

00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:49.212
of the people on the Usage Panel.

00:12:49.212 --> 00:12:51.244
But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries?

00:12:51.244 --> 00:12:54.291
There are about 200 people on the Usage Panel.

00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:56.668
They include academicians,

00:12:56.668 --> 00:12:58.345
journalists, creative writers.

00:12:58.345 --> 00:13:00.437
There's a Supreme Court justice on it

00:13:00.437 --> 00:13:02.336
and a few linguists.

00:13:02.336 --> 00:13:07.168
As of 2005, the list includes me.

00:13:07.168 --> 00:13:10.980
(Applause)

00:13:11.342 --> 00:13:14.710
Here's what we can do for you.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.070
We can give you a sense

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.122
of the range of opinions about contested usage.

00:13:20.122 --> 00:13:23.479
That is and should be the extent of our authority.

00:13:23.479 --> 00:13:26.890
We are not a language academy.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.837
About once a year, I get a ballot

00:13:29.837 --> 00:13:32.869
that asks me about whether new uses,

00:13:32.869 --> 00:13:36.207
new pronunciations, new meanings, are acceptable.

00:13:36.207 --> 00:13:39.099
Now here's what I do to fill out the ballot.

00:13:39.099 --> 00:13:42.607
I listen to what other people are saying and writing.

00:13:42.607 --> 00:13:44.851
I do not listen to my own likes

00:13:44.851 --> 00:13:48.060
and dislikes about the English language.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.529
I will be honest with you:

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:52.478
I do not like the word "impactful,"

00:13:52.478 --> 00:13:54.480
but that is neither here nor there

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.719
in terms of whether "impactful"
is becoming common usage

00:13:57.719 --> 00:14:00.970
and becoming more acceptable in written prose.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.018
So to be responsible,

00:14:02.018 --> 00:14:04.546
what I do is go look at usage,

00:14:04.546 --> 00:14:06.382
which often involves going to look

00:14:06.382 --> 00:14:09.077
at online databases such as Google Books.

00:14:09.077 --> 00:14:11.897
Well, if you look for "impactful" in Google Books,

00:14:11.897 --> 00:14:15.103
here is what you find.

00:14:15.103 --> 00:14:17.344
Well, it sure looks like "impactful"

00:14:17.344 --> 00:14:19.074
is proving useful

00:14:19.074 --> 00:14:20.703
for a certain number of writers,

00:14:20.703 --> 00:14:22.303
and has become more and more useful

00:14:22.303 --> 00:14:24.262
over the last 20 years.

00:14:24.262 --> 00:14:26.415
Now, there are going to be changes

00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:29.049
that all of us don't like in the language.

00:14:29.049 --> 00:14:31.233
There are going to be changes where you think,

00:14:31.233 --> 00:14:32.220
"Really?

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.905
Does the language have to change that way?"

00:14:35.905 --> 00:14:37.588
What I'm saying is,

00:14:37.588 --> 00:14:39.310
we should be less quick

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:43.101
to decide that that change is terrible,

00:14:43.101 --> 00:14:44.815
we should be less quick to impose

00:14:44.815 --> 00:14:48.116
our likes and dislikes about words on other people,

00:14:48.116 --> 00:14:51.030
and we should be entirely reluctant

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.774
to think that the English language is in trouble.

00:14:53.774 --> 00:14:57.970
It's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.980
with the creativity of the speakers who speak it.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.598
In retrospect, we think it's fascinating

00:15:03.598 --> 00:15:06.976
that the word "nice" used to mean silly,

00:15:06.976 --> 00:15:08.660
and that the word "decimate"

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.165
used to mean to kill one in every 10.

00:15:12.165 --> 00:15:16.358
(Laughter)

00:15:17.162 --> 00:15:22.255
We think that Ben Franklin was being silly

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.904
to worry about "notice" as a verb.

00:15:24.904 --> 00:15:26.367
Well, you know what?

00:15:26.367 --> 00:15:29.067
We're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years

00:15:29.067 --> 00:15:31.364
for worrying about "impact" as a verb

00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:34.176
and "invite" as a noun.

00:15:34.176 --> 00:15:36.416
The language is not going to change so fast

00:15:36.416 --> 00:15:38.313
that we can't keep up.

00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:40.596
Language just doesn't work that way.

00:15:40.596 --> 00:15:42.209
I hope that what you can do

00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:45.038
is find language change not worrisome

00:15:45.038 --> 00:15:47.076
but fun and fascinating,

00:15:47.076 --> 00:15:50.085
just the way dictionary editors do.

00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:52.047
I hope you can enjoy being part

00:15:52.047 --> 00:15:57.051
of the creativity that is continually remaking

00:15:57.051 --> 00:16:00.327
our language and keeping it robust.

00:16:00.327 --> 00:16:03.247
So how does a word get into a dictionary?

00:16:03.247 --> 00:16:05.716
It gets in because we use it

00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:07.340
and we keep using it,

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.575
and dictionary editors are paying attention to us.

00:16:11.575 --> 00:16:14.695
If you're thinking, "But that lets all of us decide

00:16:14.695 --> 00:16:16.444
what words mean,"

00:16:16.444 --> 00:16:20.495
I would say, "Yes it does,

00:16:20.495 --> 00:16:22.847
and it always has."

00:16:22.847 --> 00:16:26.774
Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource,

00:16:26.774 --> 00:16:30.270
but there is no objective
dictionary authority out there

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:34.043
that is the final arbiter about what words mean.

00:16:34.043 --> 00:16:36.556
If a community of speakers is using a word

00:16:36.556 --> 00:16:40.152
and knows what it means, it's real.

00:16:40.152 --> 00:16:41.520
That word might be slangy,

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.162
that word might be informal,

00:16:43.162 --> 00:16:45.067
that word might be a word that you think

00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:47.524
is illogical or unnecessary,

00:16:47.524 --> 00:16:50.075
but that word that we're using,

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:52.433
that word is real.

00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:54.774
Thank you.

00:16:54.774 --> 00:16:56.453
(Applause)
