00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:04.031
Think of a hard choice
you'll face in the near future.

00:00:04.391 --> 00:00:06.212
It might be between two careers --

00:00:06.236 --> 00:00:07.683
artist and accountant --

00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:10.734
or places to live --
the city or the country --

00:00:11.123 --> 00:00:12.997
or even between two people to marry --

00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:15.969
you could marry Betty
or you could marry Lolita.

00:00:16.572 --> 00:00:19.565
Or it might be a choice
about whether to have children,

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.936
to have an ailing parent move in with you,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.177
to raise your child in a religion
that your partner lives by

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.593
but leaves you cold.

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:30.073
Or whether to donate
your life savings to charity.

00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:33.536
Chances are, the hard choice
you thought of was something big,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.064
something momentous,
something that matters to you.

00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:39.029
Hard choices seem to be occasions

00:00:39.053 --> 00:00:42.563
for agonizing, hand-wringing,
the gnashing of teeth.

00:00:44.073 --> 00:00:46.138
But I think we've
misunderstood hard choices

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:48.229
and the role they play in our lives.

00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:50.131
Understanding hard choices

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.638
uncovers a hidden power
each of us possesses.

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:58.321
What makes a choice hard
is the way the alternatives relate.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.359
In any easy choice,

00:01:00.383 --> 00:01:02.521
one alternative is better than the other.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.379
In a hard choice,

00:01:04.403 --> 00:01:06.931
one alternative is better in some ways,

00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:09.156
the other alternative
is better in other ways,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.851
and neither is better
than the other overall.

00:01:12.732 --> 00:01:16.979
You agonize over whether to stay
in your current job in the city

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:21.352
or uproot your life
for more challenging work in the country,

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.681
because staying is better in some ways,

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:25.305
moving is better in others,

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.067
and neither is better
than the other overall.

00:01:29.368 --> 00:01:32.650
We shouldn't think
that all hard choices are big.

00:01:33.023 --> 00:01:35.630
Let's say you're deciding
what to have for breakfast.

00:01:35.654 --> 00:01:38.510
You could have high fiber bran cereal

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:39.886
or a chocolate donut.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:43.769
Suppose what matters in the choice
is tastiness and healthfulness.

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.805
The cereal is better for you,

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.986
the donut tastes way better,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.212
but neither is better
than the other overall,

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.650
a hard choice.

00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:57.348
Realizing that small choices
can also be hard,

00:01:57.372 --> 00:02:00.698
may make big hard choices
seem less intractable.

00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:04.469
After all, we manage to figure out
what to have for breakfast,

00:02:04.493 --> 00:02:07.624
so maybe we can figure out
whether to stay in the city

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:09.925
or uproot for the new job in the country.

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:16.341
We also shouldn't think
that hard choices are hard

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:17.942
because we are stupid.

00:02:18.692 --> 00:02:20.608
When I graduated from college,

00:02:20.632 --> 00:02:24.134
I couldn't decide between two careers,
philosophy and law.

00:02:24.158 --> 00:02:26.823
I really loved philosophy.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.552
There are amazing things
you can learn as a philosopher,

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:33.051
and all from the comfort of an armchair.

00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:36.984
But I came from a modest immigrant family

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:38.457
where my idea of luxury

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:40.966
was having a pork tongue
and jelly sandwich

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.533
in my school lunchbox,

00:02:43.232 --> 00:02:45.597
so the thought of spending my whole life

00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:48.580
sitting around in armchairs
just thinking ...

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.516
Well, that struck me as the height
of extravagance and frivolity.

00:02:53.357 --> 00:02:55.103
So I got out my yellow pad,

00:02:55.127 --> 00:02:57.010
I drew a line down the middle,

00:02:57.034 --> 00:02:59.431
and I tried my best
to think of the reasons

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:02.128
for and against each alternative.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.389
I remember thinking to myself,

00:03:05.413 --> 00:03:09.825
if only I knew what my life
in each career would be like.

00:03:10.428 --> 00:03:16.415
If only God or Netflix would send me a DVD
of my two possible future careers,

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:17.611
I'd be set.

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:19.537
I'd compare them side by side,

00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:21.468
I'd see that one was better,

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:23.280
and the choice would be easy.

00:03:23.867 --> 00:03:25.476
But I got no DVD,

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:28.819
and because I couldn't
figure out which was better,

00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:31.556
I did what many of us do in hard choices:

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.569
I took the safest option.

00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:38.731
Fear of being an unemployed philosopher
led me to become a lawyer,

00:03:40.256 --> 00:03:43.586
and as I discovered,
lawyering didn't quite fit.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.239
It wasn't who I was.

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.503
So now I'm a philosopher,

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.465
and I study hard choices,

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.814
and I can tell you,
that fear of the unknown,

00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:57.264
while a common motivational default
in dealing with hard choices,

00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.011
rests on a misconception of them.

00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:03.435
It's a mistake to think
that in hard choices,

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.453
one alternative
really is better than the other,

00:04:06.477 --> 00:04:08.436
but we're too stupid to know which,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.903
and since we don't know which,

00:04:09.927 --> 00:04:12.403
we might as well take
the least risky option.

00:04:12.825 --> 00:04:15.183
Even taking two alternatives side by side

00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:18.854
with full information,
a choice can still be hard.

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.155
Hard choices are hard
not because of us or our ignorance;

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:27.421
they're hard because there
is no best option.

00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:31.155
Now, if there's no best option,

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:35.600
if the scales don't tip in favor
of one alternative over another,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.746
then surely the alternatives
must be equally good.

00:04:39.797 --> 00:04:42.068
So maybe the right thing
to say in hard choices

00:04:42.092 --> 00:04:44.315
is that they're
between equally good options.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.931
But that can't be right.

00:04:45.955 --> 00:04:49.509
If alternatives are equally good,
you should just flip a coin between them,

00:04:49.898 --> 00:04:52.309
and it seems a mistake to think,

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.883
here's how you should
decide between careers,

00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:56.477
places to live, people to marry:

00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:57.680
Flip a coin.

00:04:59.156 --> 00:05:00.867
There's another reason for thinking

00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:04.978
that hard choices aren't choices
between equally good options.

00:05:06.063 --> 00:05:09.195
Suppose you have a choice
between two jobs:

00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:12.295
you could be an investment banker

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.561
or a graphic artist.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.012
There are a variety of things
that matter in such a choice,

00:05:18.036 --> 00:05:20.591
like the excitement of the work,

00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:22.352
achieving financial security,

00:05:22.376 --> 00:05:24.726
having time to raise a family, and so on.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.185
Maybe the artist's career
puts you on the cutting edge

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:31.485
of new forms of pictorial expression.

00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:34.845
Maybe the banking career
puts you on the cutting edge

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:37.881
of new forms of financial manipulation.

00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:39.464
(Laughter)

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.560
Imagine the two jobs however you like,

00:05:42.584 --> 00:05:44.545
so that neither is better than the other.

00:05:45.696 --> 00:05:48.649
Now suppose we improve one of them, a bit.

00:05:48.673 --> 00:05:50.657
Suppose the bank, wooing you,

00:05:51.612 --> 00:05:54.044
adds 500 dollars a month to your salary.

00:05:54.432 --> 00:05:55.782
Does the extra money

00:05:55.806 --> 00:05:59.812
now make the banking job
better than the artist one?

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.557
Not necessarily.

00:06:03.049 --> 00:06:07.156
A higher salary makes the banking job
better than it was before,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.798
but it might not be enough

00:06:08.822 --> 00:06:12.410
to make being a banker
better than being an artist.

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:17.766
But if an improvement in one of the jobs
doesn't make it better than the other,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.073
then the two original jobs
could not have been equally good.

00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:24.209
If you start with two things
that are equally good,

00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:25.574
and you improve one of them,

00:06:25.598 --> 00:06:27.684
it now must be better than the other.

00:06:28.653 --> 00:06:31.593
That's not the case
with options in hard choices.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.953
So now we've got a puzzle.

00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:37.363
We've got two jobs.

00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:40.875
Neither is better than the other,
nor are they equally good.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.560
So how are we supposed to choose?

00:06:43.955 --> 00:06:46.527
Something seems to have gone wrong here.

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:52.915
Maybe the choice itself is problematic,
and comparison is impossible.

00:06:54.184 --> 00:06:55.724
But that can't be right.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:59.703
It's not like we're trying to choose
between two things that can't be compared.

00:07:00.234 --> 00:07:03.111
We're weighing the merits
of two jobs, after all,

00:07:03.135 --> 00:07:06.268
not the merits of the number nine
and a plate of fried eggs.

00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:11.396
A comparison of the overall
merits of two jobs

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.307
is something we can make,

00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:15.468
and one we often do make.

00:07:17.407 --> 00:07:19.463
I think the puzzle arises

00:07:19.487 --> 00:07:23.265
because of an unreflective assumption
we make about value.

00:07:23.995 --> 00:07:29.433
We unwittingly assume that values
like justice, beauty, kindness,

00:07:30.006 --> 00:07:35.093
are akin to scientific quantities,
like length, mass and weight.

00:07:37.247 --> 00:07:40.338
Take any comparative question
not involving value,

00:07:40.362 --> 00:07:43.169
such as which of two suitcases is heavier.

00:07:43.907 --> 00:07:46.140
There are only three possibilities.

00:07:46.648 --> 00:07:51.690
The weight of one is greater, lesser
or equal to the weight of the other.

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:55.779
Properties like weight can be
represented by real numbers --

00:07:55.803 --> 00:07:57.741
one, two, three and so on --

00:07:57.765 --> 00:08:00.504
and there are only
three possible comparisons

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.693
between any two real numbers.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.765
One number is greater, lesser,
or equal to the other.

00:08:08.475 --> 00:08:10.197
Not so with values.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.267
As post-Enlightenment creatures,

00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:15.241
we tend to assume

00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:20.169
that scientific thinking holds the key
to everything of importance in our world,

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.616
but the world of value
is different from the world of science.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.228
The stuff of the one world
can be quantified by real numbers.

00:08:28.252 --> 00:08:30.572
The stuff of the other world can't.

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:35.984
We shouldn't assume that the world of is,
of lengths and weights,

00:08:36.008 --> 00:08:38.915
has the same structure
as the world of ought,

00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:40.166
of what we should do.

00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:42.985
So if what matters to us --

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:46.523
a child's delight, the love
you have for your partner —

00:08:46.547 --> 00:08:49.351
can't be represented by real numbers,

00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:51.317
then there's no reason to believe

00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:55.157
that in choice, there are only
three possibilities --

00:08:55.181 --> 00:08:59.124
that one alternative is better,
worse or equal to the other.

00:09:00.464 --> 00:09:04.706
We need to introduce
a new, fourth relation

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.345
beyond being better, worse or equal,

00:09:08.369 --> 00:09:11.519
that describes what's going on
in hard choices.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.769
I like to say that
the alternatives are "on a par."

00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:17.051
When alternatives are on a par,

00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:20.441
it may matter very much which you choose,

00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:23.380
but one alternative
isn't better than the other.

00:09:23.404 --> 00:09:27.782
Rather, the alternatives are
in the same neighborhood of value,

00:09:27.806 --> 00:09:29.853
in the same league of value,

00:09:29.877 --> 00:09:34.034
while at the same time
being very different in kind of value.

00:09:34.444 --> 00:09:36.603
That's why the choice is hard.

00:09:37.754 --> 00:09:40.163
Understanding hard choices in this way

00:09:40.187 --> 00:09:43.460
uncovers something
about ourselves we didn't know.

00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:47.585
Each of us has the power
to create reasons.

00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:53.486
Imagine a world
in which every choice you face

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.883
is an easy choice,

00:09:54.907 --> 00:09:57.183
that is, there's always
a best alternative.

00:09:57.207 --> 00:10:00.590
If there's a best alternative,
then that's the one you should choose,

00:10:00.614 --> 00:10:02.376
because part of being rational

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.115
is doing the better thing
rather than the worse thing,

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:07.559
choosing what you have
most reason to choose.

00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:10.273
In such a world,

00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:12.698
we'd have most reason

00:10:12.722 --> 00:10:15.169
to wear black socks instead of pink socks,

00:10:15.193 --> 00:10:17.129
to eat cereal instead of donuts,

00:10:17.153 --> 00:10:19.207
to live in the city
rather than the country,

00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:21.102
to marry Betty instead of Lolita.

00:10:21.126 --> 00:10:26.653
A world full of only easy choices
would enslave us to reasons.

00:10:27.963 --> 00:10:29.266
When you think about it,

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.480
(Laughter)

00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:35.507
it's nuts to believe
that the reasons given to you

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:40.982
dictated that you had
most reason to pursue

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:42.904
the exact hobbies you do,

00:10:43.952 --> 00:10:46.149
to live in the exact house you do,

00:10:46.173 --> 00:10:48.074
to work at the exact job you do.

00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:53.372
Instead, you faced alternatives
that were on a par --

00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:55.125
hard choices --

00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:58.162
and you made reasons for yourself

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:01.766
to choose that hobby,
that house and that job.

00:11:03.004 --> 00:11:05.237
When alternatives are on a par,

00:11:05.261 --> 00:11:06.789
the reasons given to us,

00:11:06.813 --> 00:11:09.769
the ones that determine
whether we're making a mistake,

00:11:09.793 --> 00:11:12.084
are silent as to what to do.

00:11:12.989 --> 00:11:16.678
It's here, in the space of hard choices,

00:11:16.702 --> 00:11:20.344
that we get to exercise
our normative power --

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.792
the power to create reasons for yourself,

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:28.202
to make yourself into the kind of person

00:11:28.226 --> 00:11:32.130
for whom country living
is preferable to the urban life.

00:11:33.337 --> 00:11:36.719
When we choose between options
that are on a par,

00:11:36.743 --> 00:11:39.854
we can do something
really rather remarkable.

00:11:40.495 --> 00:11:43.350
We can put our very selves
behind an option.

00:11:44.325 --> 00:11:46.109
Here's where I stand.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.108
Here's who I am, I am for banking.

00:11:50.132 --> 00:11:52.267
I am for chocolate donuts.

00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:53.859
(Laughter)

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.697
This response in hard choices
is a rational response,

00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:01.397
but it's not dictated
by reasons given to us.

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.854
Rather, it's supported
by reasons created by us.

00:12:07.765 --> 00:12:10.332
When we create reasons for ourselves

00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:13.622
to become this kind
of person rather than that,

00:12:13.646 --> 00:12:16.826
we wholeheartedly become
the people that we are.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.048
You might say that we become
the authors of our own lives.

00:12:23.047 --> 00:12:27.644
So when we face hard choices,
we shouldn't beat our head against a wall

00:12:27.668 --> 00:12:30.021
trying to figure out
which alternative is better.

00:12:30.045 --> 00:12:32.010
There is no best alternative.

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:35.038
Instead of looking for reasons out there,

00:12:35.062 --> 00:12:37.339
we should be looking for reasons in here:

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:39.342
Who am I to be?

00:12:40.278 --> 00:12:43.720
You might decide to be
a pink sock-wearing,

00:12:43.744 --> 00:12:47.633
cereal-loving, country-living banker,

00:12:47.657 --> 00:12:50.849
and I might decide to be
a black sock-wearing,

00:12:50.873 --> 00:12:52.917
urban, donut-loving artist.

00:12:54.132 --> 00:12:58.478
What we do in hard choices
is very much up to each of us.

00:13:00.887 --> 00:13:05.712
Now, people who don't exercise
their normative powers in hard choices

00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:07.062
are drifters.

00:13:07.513 --> 00:13:09.101
We all know people like that.

00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:11.421
I drifted into being a lawyer.

00:13:11.445 --> 00:13:13.579
I didn't put my agency behind lawyering.

00:13:13.603 --> 00:13:15.201
I wasn't for lawyering.

00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:21.415
Drifters allow the world
to write the story of their lives.

00:13:21.439 --> 00:13:25.267
They let mechanisms
of reward and punishment --

00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:29.206
pats on the head, fear,
the easiness of an option --

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.920
to determine what they do.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.764
So the lesson of hard choices:

00:13:34.373 --> 00:13:38.837
reflect on what you can
put your agency behind,

00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:41.506
on what you can be for,

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.745
and through hard choices,

00:13:43.769 --> 00:13:45.042
become that person.

00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:50.032
Far from being sources of agony and dread,

00:13:50.056 --> 00:13:53.408
hard choices are precious opportunities

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:57.346
for us to celebrate what is special
about the human condition,

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.973
that the reasons that govern
our choices as correct or incorrect

00:14:01.997 --> 00:14:03.663
sometimes run out,

00:14:03.687 --> 00:14:06.762
and it is here, in the space
of hard choices,

00:14:06.786 --> 00:14:10.903
that we have the power
to create reasons for ourselves

00:14:10.927 --> 00:14:13.782
to become the distinctive
people that we are.

00:14:14.496 --> 00:14:17.222
And that's why hard
choices are not a curse

00:14:17.246 --> 00:14:18.419
but a godsend.

00:14:18.967 --> 00:14:20.138
Thank you.

00:14:20.162 --> 00:14:23.610
(Applause)
