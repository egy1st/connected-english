00:00:01.912 --> 00:00:04.333
On November 5th, 1990,

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.132
a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:09.517
into a hotel in Manhattan

00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:12.482
and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane,

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:16.280
the leader of the Jewish Defense League.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.940
Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.566
but while serving time on lesser charges,

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.160
he and other men began planning attacks

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.051
on a dozen New York City landmarks,

00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:29.395
including tunnels, synagogues

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:32.281
and the United Nations headquarters.

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.004
Thankfully, those plans were foiled

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.841
by an FBI informant.

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:39.397
Sadly, the 1993 bombing

00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:42.578
of the World Trade Center was not.

00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:44.317
Nosair would eventually be convicted

00:00:44.317 --> 00:00:47.741
for his involvement in the plot.

00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:51.988
El-Sayyid Nosair is my father.

00:00:51.988 --> 00:00:53.898
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

00:00:53.898 --> 00:00:57.622
in 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer,

00:00:57.622 --> 00:01:00.817
and a loving American mother
and grade school teacher,

00:01:00.817 --> 00:01:02.068
who together tried their best

00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:05.181
to create a happy childhood for me.

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:06.723
It wasn't until I was seven years old

00:01:06.723 --> 00:01:10.266
that our family dynamic started to change.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.416
My father exposed me to a side of Islam

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:16.343
that few people, including the majority of Muslims,

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:19.060
get to see.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.729
It's been my experience that when people

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.091
take the time to interact with one another,

00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:26.149
it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part,

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.601
we all want the same things out of life.

00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.778
However, in every religion, in every population,

00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:34.366
you'll find a small percentage of people

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:37.324
who hold so fervently to their beliefs

00:01:37.324 --> 00:01:40.088
that they feel they must use any means necessary

00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:43.684
to make others live as they do.

00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:45.545
A few months prior to his arrest,

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:47.547
he sat me down and explained that

00:01:47.547 --> 00:01:50.666
for the past few weekends, he and some friends

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.780
had been going to a shooting range on Long Island

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.963
for target practice.

00:01:54.963 --> 00:01:58.653
He told me I'd be going with him the next morning.

00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:00.464
We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range,

00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:02.979
which unbeknownst to our group was being watched

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.100
by the FBI.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.081
When it was my turn to shoot,

00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:09.767
my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder

00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:11.212
and explained how to aim at the target

00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:14.353
about 30 yards off.

00:02:14.353 --> 00:02:16.696
That day, the last bullet I shot

00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:19.715
hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target

00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:22.844
and to everyone's surprise, especially mine,

00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:26.818
the entire target burst into flames.

00:02:26.818 --> 00:02:28.719
My uncle turned to the other men,

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.040
and in Arabic said, "Ibn abuh."

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.795
Like father, like son.

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:38.402
They all seemed to get a really
big laugh out of that comment,

00:02:38.402 --> 00:02:40.182
but it wasn't until a few years later

00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:43.957
that I fully understood what
they thought was so funny.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:46.257
They thought they saw in me the same destruction

00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:49.588
my father was capable of.

00:02:49.588 --> 00:02:51.967
Those men would eventually be convicted

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:55.940
of placing a van filled with
1,500 pounds of explosives

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.089
into the sub-level parking lot of the
World Trade Center's North Tower,

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.930
causing an explosion that killed six people

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.310
and injured over 1,000 others.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.701
These were the men I looked up to.

00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:12.897
These were the men I called
ammu, which means uncle.

00:03:12.897 --> 00:03:14.668
By the time I turned 19,

00:03:14.668 --> 00:03:17.937
I had already moved 20 times in my life,

00:03:17.937 --> 00:03:19.966
and that instability during my childhood

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.440
didn't really provide an opportunity

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.321
to make many friends.

00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:26.474
Each time I would begin to feel
comfortable around someone,

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:29.643
it was time to pack up and move to the next town.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.822
Being the perpetual new face in class,

00:03:31.822 --> 00:03:34.461
I was frequently the target of bullies.

00:03:34.461 --> 00:03:36.771
I kept my identity a secret from my classmates

00:03:36.771 --> 00:03:38.089
to avoid being targeted,

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.485
but as it turns out, being the
quiet, chubby new kid in class

00:03:41.485 --> 00:03:44.002
was more than enough ammunition.

00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:46.199
So for the most part, I spent my time at home

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.870
reading books and watching TV

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.639
or playing video games.

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.509
For those reasons, my social skills were lacking,

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:54.759
to say the least,

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.194
and growing up in a bigoted household,

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.674
I wasn't prepared for the real world.

00:03:58.674 --> 00:04:00.393
I'd been raised to judge people

00:04:00.393 --> 00:04:02.460
based on arbitrary measurements,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.203
like a person's race or religion.

00:04:06.203 --> 00:04:09.354
So what opened my eyes?

00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:10.948
One of my first experiences

00:04:10.948 --> 00:04:13.130
that challenged this way of thinking

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.117
was during the 2000 presidential elections.

00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:18.151
Through a college prep program,

00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:19.285
I was able to take part

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:22.655
in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.

00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:25.586
My particular group's focus was on youth violence,

00:04:25.586 --> 00:04:27.937
and having been the victim
of bullying for most of my life,

00:04:27.937 --> 00:04:32.009
this was a subject in which
I felt particularly passionate.

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.322
The members of our group came
from many different walks of life.

00:04:36.322 --> 00:04:38.330
One day toward the end of the convention,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.418
I found out that one of the kids I had befriended

00:04:41.418 --> 00:04:43.640
was Jewish.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.961
Now, it had taken several days

00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:46.604
for this detail to come to light,

00:04:46.604 --> 00:04:50.364
and I realized that there was no natural animosity

00:04:50.364 --> 00:04:52.609
between the two of us.

00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:55.665
I had never had a Jewish friend before,

00:04:55.665 --> 00:04:58.474
and frankly I felt a sense of pride

00:04:58.474 --> 00:05:00.459
in having been able to overcome a barrier

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:02.743
that for most of my life I had been led to believe

00:05:02.743 --> 00:05:05.184
was insurmountable.

00:05:05.184 --> 00:05:07.200
Another major turning point came when

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.722
I found a summer job at Busch Gardens,

00:05:09.722 --> 00:05:12.114
an amusement park.

00:05:12.114 --> 00:05:15.010
There, I was exposed to people
from all sorts of faiths and cultures,

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.367
and that experience proved to be fundamental

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:21.248
to the development of my character.

00:05:21.248 --> 00:05:22.508
Most of my life, I'd been taught

00:05:22.508 --> 00:05:26.254
that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension,

00:05:26.254 --> 00:05:29.719
that all gay people were a negative influence.

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.980
As chance would have it, I had the opportunity

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.746
to work with some of the gay performers

00:05:33.746 --> 00:05:35.126
at a show there,

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.660
and soon found that many were the kindest,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.549
least judgmental people I had ever met.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.792
Being bullied as a kid

00:05:43.792 --> 00:05:46.080
created a sense of empathy in me

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.626
toward the suffering of others,

00:05:47.626 --> 00:05:49.574
and it comes very unnaturally to me

00:05:49.574 --> 00:05:51.542
to treat people who are kind

00:05:51.542 --> 00:05:55.570
in any other way than how
I would want to be treated.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.505
Because of that feeling, I was able

00:05:57.505 --> 00:06:01.892
to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child

00:06:01.892 --> 00:06:05.255
with real life experience and interaction.

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:07.597
I don't know what it's like to be gay,

00:06:07.597 --> 00:06:09.260
but I'm well acquainted with being judged

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.236
for something that's beyond my control.

00:06:13.236 --> 00:06:16.971
Then there was "The Daily Show."

00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:19.243
On a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me

00:06:19.243 --> 00:06:22.922
to be intellectually honest with
myself about my own bigotry

00:06:22.922 --> 00:06:25.239
and helped me to realize that a person's race,

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:28.335
religion or sexual orientation

00:06:28.335 --> 00:06:32.978
had nothing to do with the quality of one's character.

00:06:32.978 --> 00:06:36.353
He was in many ways a father figure to me

00:06:36.353 --> 00:06:39.694
when I was in desperate need of one.

00:06:39.694 --> 00:06:43.598
Inspiration can often come
from an unexpected place,

00:06:43.598 --> 00:06:45.983
and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more

00:06:45.983 --> 00:06:48.323
to positively influence my worldview

00:06:48.323 --> 00:06:50.170
than my own extremist father

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.553
is not lost on me.

00:06:53.553 --> 00:06:55.713
One day, I had a conversation with my mother

00:06:55.713 --> 00:06:57.883
about how my worldview was starting to change,

00:06:57.883 --> 00:07:00.559
and she said something to me

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:02.090
that I will hold dear to my heart

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.339
for as long as I live.

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:06.810
She looked at me with the weary eyes

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.532
of someone who had experienced

00:07:08.532 --> 00:07:12.590
enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said,

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.263
"I'm tired of hating people."

00:07:16.263 --> 00:07:19.140
In that instant, I realized how much negative energy

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.556
it takes to hold that hatred inside of you.

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.880
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.915
I changed it when my family decided

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.580
to end our connection with my father

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.942
and start a new life.

00:07:32.942 --> 00:07:35.100
So why would I out myself

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.500
and potentially put myself in danger?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.368
Well, that's simple.

00:07:40.368 --> 00:07:44.130
I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.343
who is compelled to use violence

00:07:46.343 --> 00:07:48.704
may hear my story and realize

00:07:48.704 --> 00:07:51.201
that there is a better way,

00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:52.675
that although I had been subjected

00:07:52.675 --> 00:07:55.431
to this violent, intolerant ideology,

00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:57.920
that I did not become fanaticized.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.557
Instead, I choose to use my experience

00:08:00.557 --> 00:08:02.930
to fight back against terrorism,

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.321
against the bigotry.

00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:10.109
I do it for the victims of terrorism

00:08:10.109 --> 00:08:12.291
and their loved ones,

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.124
for the terrible pain and loss

00:08:14.124 --> 00:08:17.325
that terrorism has forced upon their lives.

00:08:17.325 --> 00:08:19.693
For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out

00:08:19.693 --> 00:08:22.225
against these senseless acts

00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:26.219
and condemn my father's actions.

00:08:26.219 --> 00:08:28.862
And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof

00:08:28.862 --> 00:08:33.520
that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.433
and the son does not have to follow

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.515
the ways of his father.

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:42.305
I am not my father.

00:08:42.305 --> 00:08:45.205
Thank you. (Applause)

00:08:45.205 --> 00:08:48.864
Thank you, everybody. (Applause)

00:08:48.864 --> 00:08:51.504
Thank you all. (Applause)

00:08:51.504 --> 00:08:55.504
Thanks a lot. (Applause)
