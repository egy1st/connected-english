00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:02.783
I'm a lifelong traveler.

00:00:02.783 --> 00:00:04.442
Even as a little kid,

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:07.922
I was actually working out
that it would be cheaper

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:10.048
to go to boarding school in England

00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:15.168
than just to the best school down the road
from my parents' house in California.

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:18.547
So, from the time I was nine years old

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:21.775
I was flying alone several times a year

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:25.241
over the North Pole, just to go to school.

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.876
And of course the more I flew
the more I came to love to fly,

00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:32.150
so the very week after I graduated
from high school,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.864
I got a job mopping tables

00:00:34.864 --> 00:00:39.065
so that I could spend
every season of my 18th year

00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:42.066
on a different continent.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:46.187
And then, almost inevitably,
I became a travel writer

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:50.296
so my job and my joy could become one.

00:00:50.636 --> 00:00:54.522
And I really began to feel
that if you were lucky enough

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:57.954
to walk around
the candlelit temples of Tibet

00:00:57.954 --> 00:01:00.758
or to wander along the seafronts in Havana

00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:03.138
with music passing all around you,

00:01:03.138 --> 00:01:06.435
you could bring those sounds 
and the high cobalt skies

00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:08.777
and the flash of the blue ocean

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.790
back to your friends at home,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.581
and really bring some magic

00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:15.402
and clarity to your own life.

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:17.868
Except, as you all know,

00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:20.700
one of the first things you learn
when you travel

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.077
is that nowhere is magical
unless you can bring the right eyes to it.

00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:28.557
You take an angry man to the Himalayas,

00:01:28.557 --> 00:01:31.873
he just starts complaining about the food.

00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:34.395
And I found that the best way

00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:38.439
that I could develop more attentive
and more appreciative eyes

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.037
was, oddly,

00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:43.505
by going nowhere, just by sitting still.

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:46.354
And of course sitting still
is how many of us get

00:01:46.354 --> 00:01:51.404
what we most crave and need
in our accelerated lives, a break.

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:53.846
But it was also the only way

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:59.347
that I could find to sift through
the slideshow of my experience

00:01:59.347 --> 00:02:02.631
and make sense of the future and the past.

00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:05.673
And so, to my great surprise,

00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:07.575
I found that going nowhere

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.697
was at least as exciting
as going to Tibet or to Cuba.

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:15.749
And by going nowhere,
I mean nothing more intimidating

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:18.584
than taking a few minutes out of every day

00:02:18.584 --> 00:02:20.555
or a few days out of every season,

00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:22.524
or even, as some people do,

00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:25.343
a few years out of a life

00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:28.044
in order to sit still long enough

00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:31.435
to find out what moves you most,

00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:34.779
to recall where your truest happiness lies

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.549
and to remember that sometimes

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.264
making a living and making a life

00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:42.447
point in opposite directions.

00:02:42.457 --> 00:02:45.654
And of course, this is what wise beings
through the centuries

00:02:45.654 --> 00:02:47.897
from every tradition have been telling us.

00:02:47.897 --> 00:02:49.823
It's an old idea.

00:02:49.823 --> 00:02:53.117
More than 2,000 years ago, 
the Stoics were reminding us

00:02:53.117 --> 00:02:56.171
it's not our experience
that makes our lives,

00:02:56.171 --> 00:02:58.379
it's what we do with it.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.231
Imagine a hurricane suddenly 
sweeps through your town

00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:06.739
and reduces every last thing to rubble.

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.401
One man is traumatized for life.

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:14.265
But another, maybe even his brother,
almost feels liberated,

00:03:14.265 --> 00:03:18.507
and decides this is a great chance
to start his life anew.

00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:20.357
It's exactly the same event,

00:03:20.357 --> 00:03:22.909
but radically different responses.

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.290
There is nothing either good or bad,
as Shakespeare told us in "Hamlet,"

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.430
but thinking makes it so.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.060
And this has certainly been
my experience as a traveler.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.233
Twenty-four years ago I took 
the most mind-bending trip

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:39.915
across North Korea.

00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:42.804
But the trip lasted a few days.

00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:46.384
What I've done with it sitting still,
going back to it in my head,

00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:50.056
trying to understand it,
finding a place for it in my thinking,

00:03:50.056 --> 00:03:52.320
that's lasted 24 years already

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.683
and will probably last a lifetime.

00:03:55.683 --> 00:03:59.059
The trip, in other words,
gave me some amazing sights,

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:01.124
but it's only sitting still

00:04:01.124 --> 00:04:04.816
that allows me to turn those
into lasting insights.

00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:07.762
And I sometimes think
that so much of our life

00:04:07.762 --> 00:04:09.779
takes place inside our heads,

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:14.592
in memory or imagination
or interpretation or speculation,

00:04:14.592 --> 00:04:17.395
that if I really want to change my life

00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:21.430
I might best begin by changing my mind.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.950
Again, none of this is new;

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.250
that's why Shakespeare and the Stoics
were telling us this centuries ago,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.503
but Shakespeare never had to face
200 emails in a day.

00:04:31.503 --> 00:04:32.905
(Laughter)

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:37.228
The Stoics, as far as I know,
were not on Facebook.

00:04:37.228 --> 00:04:40.074
We all know that in our on-demand lives,

00:04:40.084 --> 00:04:42.192
one of the things that's most on demand

00:04:42.192 --> 00:04:43.420
is ourselves.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.052
Wherever we are, any time of night or day,

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:49.783
our bosses, junk-mailers,
our parents can get to us.

00:04:50.443 --> 00:04:53.772
Sociologists have actually found
that in recent years

00:04:53.772 --> 00:04:57.230
Americans are working fewer hours
than 50 years ago,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.396
but we feel as if we're working more.

00:05:00.396 --> 00:05:02.942
We have more and more time-saving devices,

00:05:02.942 --> 00:05:06.742
but sometimes, it seems,
less and less time.

00:05:06.742 --> 00:05:09.226
We can more and more easily 
make contact with people

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.585
on the furthest corners of the planet,

00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:13.579
but sometimes in that process

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:17.325
we lose contact with ourselves.

00:05:17.325 --> 00:05:21.118
And one of my biggest surprises 
as a traveler

00:05:21.118 --> 00:05:24.296
has been to find
that often it's exactly the people

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:27.413
who have most enabled us to get anywhere

00:05:27.413 --> 00:05:30.128
who are intent on going nowhere.

00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:32.313
In other words, precisely those beings

00:05:32.313 --> 00:05:34.646
who have created the technologies

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:38.196
that override so many
of the limits of old,

00:05:38.196 --> 00:05:41.207
are the ones wisest
about the need for limits,

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:44.883
even when it comes to technology.

00:05:44.883 --> 00:05:47.512
I once went to the Google headquarters

00:05:47.512 --> 00:05:50.315
and I saw all the things
many of you have heard about;

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:53.539
the indoor tree houses, the trampolines,

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.017
workers at that time enjoying 20 percent
of their paid time free

00:05:58.017 --> 00:06:02.057
so that they could just let
their imaginations go wandering.

00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:04.975
But what impressed me even more

00:06:04.975 --> 00:06:08.554
was that as I was waiting
for my digital I.D.,

00:06:08.554 --> 00:06:11.323
one Googler was telling me
about the program

00:06:11.323 --> 00:06:15.117
that he was about to start
to teach the many, many Googlers

00:06:15.117 --> 00:06:18.510
who practice yoga
to become trainers in it,

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.764
and the other Googler was telling me
about the book that he was about to write

00:06:22.764 --> 00:06:25.778
on the inner search engine,

00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:28.771
and the ways in which science
has empirically shown

00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:31.308
that sitting still, or meditation,

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:34.920
can lead not just to better 
health or to clearer thinking,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.440
but even to emotional intelligence.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.753
I have another friend in Silicon Valley

00:06:40.753 --> 00:06:43.875
who is really one 
of the most eloquent spokesmen

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:45.678
for the latest technologies,

00:06:45.678 --> 00:06:49.563
and in fact was one of the founders
of Wired magazine, Kevin Kelly.

00:06:49.563 --> 00:06:53.316
And Kevin wrote his last book
on fresh technologies

00:06:53.316 --> 00:06:57.879
without a smartphone
or a laptop or a TV in his home.

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:00.761
And like many in Silicon Valley,

00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:03.737
he tries really hard to observe

00:07:03.737 --> 00:07:06.923
what they call an Internet sabbath,

00:07:07.643 --> 00:07:10.741
whereby for 24 or 48 hours every week

00:07:10.741 --> 00:07:13.821
they go completely offline

00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:15.969
in order to gather the sense of direction

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:19.463
and proportion they'll need 
when they go online again.

00:07:19.463 --> 00:07:23.190
The one thing perhaps
that technology hasn't always given us

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.899
is a sense of how to make
the wisest use of technology.

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:30.564
And when you speak of the sabbath,

00:07:30.564 --> 00:07:32.501
look at the Ten Commandments --

00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:36.874
there's only one word there
for which the adjective "holy" is used,

00:07:36.874 --> 00:07:39.150
and that's the Sabbath.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.180
I pick up the Jewish holy book
of the Torah --

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.521
its longest chapter, it's on the Sabbath.

00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:49.418
And we all know that it's really
one of our greatest luxuries,

00:07:49.418 --> 00:07:51.606
the empty space.

00:07:51.606 --> 00:07:55.528
In many a piece of music, 
it's the pause or the rest

00:07:55.528 --> 00:07:58.638
that gives the piece
its beauty and its shape.

00:07:58.638 --> 00:08:00.221
And I know I as a writer

00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:04.354
will often try to include
a lot of empty space on the page

00:08:04.354 --> 00:08:08.066
so that the reader can complete
my thoughts and sentences

00:08:08.066 --> 00:08:12.168
and so that her imagination
has room to breathe.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.196
Now, in the physical domain, 
of course, many people,

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:17.720
if they have the resources,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.200
will try to get a place in the country,
a second home.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.342
I've never begun to have those resources,

00:08:24.342 --> 00:08:28.057
but I sometimes remember
that any time I want,

00:08:28.057 --> 00:08:32.422
I can get a second home in time,
if not in space,

00:08:32.422 --> 00:08:34.853
just by taking a day off.

00:08:34.853 --> 00:08:38.418
And it's never easy because, of course, 
whenever I do I spend much of it

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:40.096
worried about all the extra stuff

00:08:40.096 --> 00:08:42.770
that's going to crash down on me
the following day.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.792
I sometimes think I'd rather give up
meat or sex or wine

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:47.834
than the chance to check on my emails.

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:48.958
(Laughter)

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:53.266
And every season I do try to take
three days off on retreat

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:57.568
but a part of me still feels guilty
to be leaving my poor wife behind

00:08:57.568 --> 00:09:00.616
and to be ignoring
all those seemingly urgent emails

00:09:00.616 --> 00:09:02.370
from my bosses

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.437
and maybe to be missing
a friend's birthday party.

00:09:05.437 --> 00:09:09.265
But as soon as I get
to a place of real quiet,

00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:11.734
I realize that it's only by going there

00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:15.761
that I'll have anything fresh
or creative or joyful to share

00:09:15.761 --> 00:09:18.267
with my wife or bosses or friends.

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:19.547
Otherwise, really,

00:09:19.547 --> 00:09:23.067
I'm just foisting on them
my exhaustion or my distractedness,

00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:25.639
which is no blessing at all.

00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:29.317
And so when I was 29,

00:09:29.317 --> 00:09:32.382
I decided to remake my entire life

00:09:32.382 --> 00:09:35.099
in the light of going nowhere.

00:09:35.099 --> 00:09:37.600
One evening I was coming back
from the office,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.779
it was after midnight, I was in a taxi
driving through Times Square,

00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:45.279
and I suddenly realized
that I was racing around so much

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:48.435
I could never catch up with my life.

00:09:48.435 --> 00:09:50.251
And my life then, as it happened,

00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:54.072
was pretty much the one
I might have dreamed of as a little boy.

00:09:54.072 --> 00:09:56.387
I had really interesting friends
and colleagues,

00:09:56.387 --> 00:10:00.635
I had a nice apartment
on Park Avenue and 20th Street.

00:10:00.635 --> 00:10:05.068
I had, to me, a fascinating job 
writing about world affairs,

00:10:05.068 --> 00:10:08.056
but I could never separate myself
enough from them

00:10:08.056 --> 00:10:09.759
to hear myself think --

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:13.885
or really, to understand
if I was truly happy.

00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:17.072
And so, I abandoned my dream life

00:10:17.072 --> 00:10:21.227
for a single room on the backstreets
of Kyoto, Japan,

00:10:22.382 --> 00:10:25.668
which was the place
that had long exerted a strong,

00:10:25.668 --> 00:10:29.518
really mysterious gravitational pull on me.

00:10:29.518 --> 00:10:30.853
Even as a child

00:10:30.853 --> 00:10:34.224
I would just look at a painting
of Kyoto and feel I recognized it;

00:10:34.224 --> 00:10:37.471
I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it.

00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:39.400
But it's also, as you all know,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.119
a beautiful city encircled by hills,

00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:45.748
filled with more than 2,000 temples
and shrines,

00:10:45.748 --> 00:10:50.860
where people have been sitting still
for 800 years or more.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.853
And quite soon after I moved there,
I ended up where I still am

00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:57.432
with my wife, formerly our kids,

00:10:57.432 --> 00:11:00.013
in a two-room apartment
in the middle of nowhere

00:11:00.013 --> 00:11:02.401
where we have no bicycle, no car,

00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:04.570
no TV I can understand,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.123
and I still have to support my loved ones

00:11:07.123 --> 00:11:09.654
as a travel writer and a journalist,

00:11:09.654 --> 00:11:13.018
so clearly this is not ideal
for job advancement

00:11:13.018 --> 00:11:14.845
or for cultural excitement

00:11:14.845 --> 00:11:17.212
or for social diversion.

00:11:17.212 --> 00:11:21.740
But I realized that it gives me
what I prize most,

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.040
which is days

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.773
and hours.

00:11:25.773 --> 00:11:28.400
I have never once had to use
a cell phone there.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.943
I almost never have to look at the time,

00:11:31.943 --> 00:11:34.497
and every morning when I wake up,

00:11:34.497 --> 00:11:36.858
really the day stretches in front of me

00:11:36.858 --> 00:11:39.832
like an open meadow.

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:43.028
And when life throws up
one of its nasty surprises,

00:11:43.028 --> 00:11:44.989
as it will, more than once,

00:11:44.989 --> 00:11:47.170
when a doctor comes into my room

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.065
wearing a grave expression,

00:11:49.065 --> 00:11:52.693
or a car suddenly veers
in front of mine on the freeway,

00:11:52.693 --> 00:11:55.437
I know, in my bones,

00:11:55.437 --> 00:11:58.147
that it's the time I've spent
going nowhere

00:11:58.147 --> 00:12:00.149
that is going to sustain me much more

00:12:00.149 --> 00:12:05.102
than all the time I've spent
racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island.

00:12:06.306 --> 00:12:07.710
I'll always be a traveler --

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.614
my livelihood depends on it --

00:12:09.614 --> 00:12:11.793
but one of the beauties of travel

00:12:11.793 --> 00:12:15.899
is that it allows you to bring stillness

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:20.019
into the motion and the commotion
of the world.

00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:23.397
I once got on a plane
in Frankfurt, Germany,

00:12:23.397 --> 00:12:26.345
and a young German woman 
came down and sat next to me

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:28.965
and engaged me
in a very friendly conversation

00:12:28.965 --> 00:12:30.716
for about 30 minutes,

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:32.709
and then she just turned around

00:12:32.709 --> 00:12:35.982
and sat still for 12 hours.

00:12:35.982 --> 00:12:38.616
She didn't once turn on her video monitor,

00:12:38.616 --> 00:12:41.911
she never pulled out a book,
she didn't even go to sleep,

00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:44.698
she just sat still,

00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:49.229
and something of her clarity and calm
really imparted itself to me.

00:12:49.999 --> 00:12:54.321
I've noticed more and more people
taking conscious measures these days

00:12:54.321 --> 00:12:57.594
to try to open up a space
inside their lives.

00:12:57.605 --> 00:12:59.935
Some people go to black-hole resorts

00:12:59.935 --> 00:13:02.295
where they'll spend hundreds
of dollars a night

00:13:02.295 --> 00:13:05.453
in order to hand over
their cell phone and their laptop

00:13:05.453 --> 00:13:07.657
to the front desk on arrival.

00:13:07.657 --> 00:13:10.622
Some people I know,
just before they go to sleep,

00:13:10.622 --> 00:13:12.746
instead of scrolling through
their messages

00:13:12.746 --> 00:13:14.418
or checking out YouTube,

00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:17.662
just turn out the lights
and listen to some music,

00:13:17.662 --> 00:13:20.088
and notice that they sleep much better

00:13:20.088 --> 00:13:23.301
and wake up much refreshed.

00:13:23.301 --> 00:13:25.507
I was once fortunate enough

00:13:25.507 --> 00:13:30.547
to drive into the high, dark mountains
behind Los Angeles,

00:13:30.547 --> 00:13:33.095
where the great poet and singer

00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:36.317
and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen

00:13:36.317 --> 00:13:40.488
was living and working for many years
as a full-time monk

00:13:40.488 --> 00:13:43.339
in the Mount Baldy Zen Center.

00:13:43.339 --> 00:13:45.304
And I wasn't entirely surprised

00:13:45.304 --> 00:13:49.014
when the record that he released
at the age of 77,

00:13:49.014 --> 00:13:54.295
to which he gave the deliberately 
unsexy title of "Old Ideas,"

00:13:54.296 --> 00:13:57.258
went to number one in the charts 
in 17 nations in the world,

00:13:57.258 --> 00:14:00.488
hit the top five in nine others.

00:14:00.488 --> 00:14:03.255
Something in us, I think, is crying out

00:14:03.255 --> 00:14:07.761
for the sense of intimacy and depth
that we get from people like that.

00:14:07.761 --> 00:14:11.543
who take the time
and trouble to sit still.

00:14:11.543 --> 00:14:13.781
And I think many
of us have the sensation,

00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:15.309
I certainly do,

00:14:15.309 --> 00:14:19.758
that we're standing about two inches away
from a huge screen,

00:14:19.767 --> 00:14:21.605
and it's noisy and it's crowded

00:14:21.605 --> 00:14:23.781
and it's changing with every second,

00:14:23.781 --> 00:14:26.530
and that screen is our lives.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.153
And it's only by stepping back,
and then further back,

00:14:30.153 --> 00:14:31.891
and holding still,

00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:34.709
that we can begin to see
what the canvas means

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:37.005
and to catch the larger picture.

00:14:37.005 --> 00:14:40.990
And a few people do that for us
by going nowhere.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:43.972
So, in an age of acceleration,

00:14:43.972 --> 00:14:48.021
nothing can be more exhilarating
than going slow.

00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:50.202
And in an age of distraction,

00:14:50.202 --> 00:14:53.865
nothing is so luxurious
as paying attention.

00:14:54.715 --> 00:14:57.441
And in an age of constant movement,

00:14:57.441 --> 00:15:01.214
nothing is so urgent as sitting still.

00:15:01.214 --> 00:15:03.443
So you can go on your next vacation

00:15:03.443 --> 00:15:06.509
to Paris or Hawaii, or New Orleans;

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:10.049
I bet you'll have a wonderful time.

00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:15.117
But, if you want to come back home
alive and full of fresh hope,

00:15:15.117 --> 00:15:17.277
in love with the world,

00:15:17.277 --> 00:15:21.713
I think you might want
to try considering going nowhere.

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:22.860
Thank you.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.131
(Applause)
