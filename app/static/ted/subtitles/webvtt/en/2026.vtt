00:00:00.951 --> 00:00:04.660
My grandfather was a cobbler.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.899
Back in the day, he made custom-made shoes.

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.110
I never got to meet him.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.910
He perished in the Holocaust.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.988
But I did inherit his love for making,

00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:20.926
except that it doesn't exist that much anymore.

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:23.436
You see, while the Industrial Revolution

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:26.179
did a great deal to improve humanity,

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.116
it eradicated the very skill

00:00:29.116 --> 00:00:32.136
that my grandfather loved,

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.437
and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it.

00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:40.740
But all of that is about to change with 3D printing,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.818
and it all started with this,

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:47.650
the very first part

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.910
that was ever printed.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.473
It's a little older than TED.

00:00:52.473 --> 00:00:55.120
It was printed in 1983

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.840
by Chuck Hull,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.448
who invented 3D printing.

00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:03.631
But the thing that I want to talk to you about today,

00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:05.561
the big idea that I want to discuss with you,

00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:07.464
is not that 3D printing

00:01:07.464 --> 00:01:10.724
is going to catapult us into the future,

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:13.120
but rather that it's actually going

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.213
to connect us with our heritage,

00:01:16.213 --> 00:01:19.237
and it's going to usher in a new era

00:01:19.237 --> 00:01:23.121
of localized, distributed manufacturing

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:24.853
that is actually based

00:01:24.853 --> 00:01:27.312
on digital fabrication.

00:01:27.312 --> 00:01:33.110
So think about useful things.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.953
You all know your shoe size.

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:36.631
How many of you know the size

00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:38.116
of the bridge of your nose

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:41.379
or the distance between your temples?

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:43.910
Anybody?

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.708
Wouldn't it be awesome if you could,

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:47.980
for the first time, get eyewear

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.190
that actually fits you perfectly

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.865
and doesn't require any hinge assembly,

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:58.422
so chances are, the hinges are not going to break?

00:01:58.422 --> 00:02:01.020
But the implications of 3D printing

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.477
go well beyond the tips of our noses.

00:02:04.477 --> 00:02:06.805
When I met Amanda for the first time,

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:09.400
she could already stand up and walk a little bit

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.355
even though she was paralyzed from the waist down,

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:15.070
but she complained to me that her suit

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.995
was uncomfortable.

00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:18.446
It was a beautiful robotic suit

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:20.134
made by Ekso Bionics,

00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:23.902
but it wasn't inspired by her body.

00:02:23.902 --> 00:02:26.219
It wasn't made to measure.

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.942
So she challenged me to make her something

00:02:28.942 --> 00:02:32.103
that was a little bit more feminine,

00:02:32.103 --> 00:02:35.331
a little bit more elegant,

00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:36.585
and lightweight,

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:38.117
and like good tailors,

00:02:38.117 --> 00:02:42.497
we thought that we would measure her digitally.

00:02:42.497 --> 00:02:45.586
And we did. We built her an amazing suit.

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:48.594
The incredible part about what I learned

00:02:48.594 --> 00:02:51.744
from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing

00:02:51.744 --> 00:02:53.442
and we say to ourselves,

00:02:53.442 --> 00:02:56.300
it's going to replace traditional methods.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.280
Amanda looked at it and she said,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.170
it's an opportunity for me

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.375
to reclaim my symmetry

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:05.353
and to embrace my authenticity.

00:03:05.353 --> 00:03:07.482
And you know what? She's not standing still.

00:03:07.482 --> 00:03:10.283
She now wants to walk in high heels.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.339
It doesn't stop there.

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.290
3D printing is changing

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.641
personalized medical devices as we know them,

00:03:20.641 --> 00:03:25.086
from new, beautiful, conformal,

00:03:25.086 --> 00:03:28.167
ventilated scoliosis braces

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:31.529
to millions of dental restorations

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:35.026
and to beautiful bracings

00:03:35.026 --> 00:03:38.189
for amputees,

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.361
another opportunity to emotionally reconnect

00:03:41.361 --> 00:03:43.881
with your symmetry.

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:46.332
And as we sit here today,

00:03:46.332 --> 00:03:49.179
you can go wireless on your braces

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:51.260
with clear aligners,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.399
or your dental restorations.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.591
Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids

00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:58.358
are already 3D printed today.

00:03:58.358 --> 00:04:00.723
Millions of people are served today

00:04:00.723 --> 00:04:03.419
from these devices.

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.179
What about full knee replacements,

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.246
from your data, made to measure,

00:04:10.246 --> 00:04:14.708
where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed?

00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:18.216
G.E. is using 3D printing

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.894
to make the next generation LEAP engine

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:24.590
that will save fuel to the tune

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.306
of about 15 percent

00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:29.498
and cost for an airline

00:04:29.498 --> 00:04:31.893
of about 14 million dollars.

00:04:31.893 --> 00:04:33.575
Good for G.E., right?

00:04:33.575 --> 00:04:36.108
And their customers and the environment.

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:38.568
But, you know, the even better news

00:04:38.568 --> 00:04:41.799
is that this technology is no longer reserved

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:44.465
for deep-pocketed corporations.

00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:47.700
Planetary Resources, a startup

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.194
for space explorations

00:04:49.194 --> 00:04:53.750
is going to put out its first 
space probe later this year.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.200
It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.669
it costs a fraction of its cost,

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.360
and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.039
and it's going to be out in space later this year.

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.402
Google is taking on this very audacious project

00:05:11.402 --> 00:05:14.104
of making the block phone, the Ara.

00:05:14.104 --> 00:05:16.617
It's only possible because of the development

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:19.166
of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:23.526
will make functional, usable modules

00:05:23.526 --> 00:05:24.922
that will go into it.

00:05:24.922 --> 00:05:28.220
A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.768
How about food?

00:05:30.768 --> 00:05:33.292
What if we could, for the first time,

00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:36.279
make incredible delectables

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:41.000
like this beautiful TED Teddy here,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.826
that are edible?

00:05:42.826 --> 00:05:46.510
What if we could completely
change the experience,

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.315
like you see with that absinthe serving

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:54.065
that is completely 3D printed?

00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:58.868
And what if we could begin to put ingredients

00:05:58.868 --> 00:06:02.309
and colors and flavors in every taste,

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:05.107
which means not only delicious foods

00:06:05.107 --> 00:06:08.924
but the promise of personalized nutrition

00:06:08.924 --> 00:06:10.278
around the corner?

00:06:10.278 --> 00:06:13.423
And that gets me to one of the
biggest deals about 3D printing.

00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:16.284
With 3D printing, complexity is free.

00:06:16.284 --> 00:06:19.146
The printer doesn't care

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:21.790
if it makes the most rudimentary shape

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.990
or the most complex shape,

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.148
and that is completely turning design

00:06:27.148 --> 00:06:30.694
and manufacturing on its head as we know it.

00:06:30.694 --> 00:06:33.021
Many people think that 3D printing will be

00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:36.759
the end of manufacturing as we know it.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.272
I think that it's the opportunity to put

00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:42.933
tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters

00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:45.536
that will create endless abundance

00:06:45.536 --> 00:06:47.456
of job opportunities,

00:06:47.456 --> 00:06:49.420
and with that,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.314
everybody can become an expert maker

00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:54.418
and an expert manufacturer.

00:06:54.418 --> 00:06:56.304
That will take new tools.

00:06:56.304 --> 00:06:59.037
Not everybody knows how to use CAD,

00:06:59.037 --> 00:07:01.080
so we're developing haptics,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.019
perceptual devices

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:04.920
that will allow you to touch

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.685
and feel your designs

00:07:06.685 --> 00:07:09.563
as if you play with digital clay.

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:11.260
When you do things like that,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.263
and we also developed things that take

00:07:13.263 --> 00:07:15.817
physical photographs that are instantly printable,

00:07:15.817 --> 00:07:18.467
it will make it easier to create content,

00:07:18.467 --> 00:07:21.498
but with all of the unimagined,

00:07:21.498 --> 00:07:23.890
we will also have the unintended,

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:29.166
like democratized counterfeiting

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:32.150
and ubiquitous illegal possession.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.633
So many people ask me,

00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:36.141
will we have a 3D printer in every home?

00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:38.394
I think it's the wrong question to ask.

00:07:38.394 --> 00:07:39.775
The right question to ask is,

00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:43.540
how will 3D printing change my life?

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.730
Or, in other words, what room in my house

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.894
will 3D printing fit in?

00:07:47.894 --> 00:07:49.890
So everything that you see here

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.001
has been 3D printed,

00:07:52.001 --> 00:07:55.080
including these shoes

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.322
at the Amsterdam fashion show.

00:07:57.322 --> 00:08:01.018
Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes.

00:08:01.018 --> 00:08:02.710
These are shoes that represent

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.908
the continuation of his passion

00:08:04.908 --> 00:08:07.288
for hyper-local manufacturing.

00:08:07.288 --> 00:08:12.531
My grandfather didn't get to see Nike

00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:17.080
printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.487
and my father didn't get to see me standing

00:08:20.487 --> 00:08:23.597
in my hybridized 3D printed shoes.

00:08:23.597 --> 00:08:26.348
He passed away three years ago.

00:08:26.348 --> 00:08:29.591
But Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all,

00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:31.960
is right here in the house today,

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.742
and thanks to him,

00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:36.460
I can say, thanks to his invention, I can say

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.437
that I am a cobbler too,

00:08:38.437 --> 00:08:40.891
and by standing in these shoes

00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:43.225
I am honoring my past

00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:45.377
while manufacturing the future.

00:08:45.377 --> 00:08:46.900
Thank you.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.390
(Applause)
