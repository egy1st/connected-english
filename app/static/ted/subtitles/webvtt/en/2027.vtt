00:00:00.826 --> 00:00:02.642
Puzzles

00:00:02.642 --> 00:00:04.941
and magic.

00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:07.085
I work in what most people think

00:00:07.085 --> 00:00:09.523
are two distinct fields,

00:00:09.523 --> 00:00:12.594
but I believe they are the same.

00:00:12.594 --> 00:00:14.570
I am both a magician and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.406
a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor,

00:00:18.406 --> 00:00:19.770
which basically means I've taken

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.392
the world's two nerdiest hobbies

00:00:21.392 --> 00:00:24.320
and combined them into one career.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.443
And I believe that magic and puzzles are the same

00:00:27.443 --> 00:00:29.369
because they both key into one of

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.030
the most important human drives:

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.116
the urge to solve.

00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:37.249
Human beings are wired to solve,

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:40.253
to make order out of chaos.

00:00:40.253 --> 00:00:41.760
It's certainly true for me.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.599
I've been solving my whole life.

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:47.903
High school consisted of epic
Scrabble matches in the cafeteria

00:00:47.903 --> 00:00:49.612
and not really talking to girls,

00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:51.435
and then at about that time

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:53.130
I started learning magic tricks

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.597
and definitely not talking to girls.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.644
There's nothing like starting a conversation with,

00:00:57.644 --> 00:01:00.200
"Hey, did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.224
20 points in Scrabble?"

00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:06.011
But back then, I noticed an intersection

00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:08.736
between puzzles and illusion.

00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:10.682
When you do the crossword puzzle

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:12.628
or when you watch a magic show,

00:01:12.628 --> 00:01:14.880
you become a solver,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.658
and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos,

00:01:18.658 --> 00:01:21.898
the chaos of, say, a black-and-white puzzle grid,

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:24.042
a mixed-up bag of Scrabble tiles,

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.850
or a shuffled pack of playing cards.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.864
And today, as a cruciverbalist —

00:01:29.864 --> 00:01:31.450
23 points —

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.207
and an illusion designer, I create that chaos.

00:01:35.207 --> 00:01:38.552
I test your ability to solve.

00:01:38.552 --> 00:01:40.962
Now, it turns out research tells us

00:01:40.962 --> 00:01:44.960
that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.695
From birth, we are wired to solve.

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:52.532
In one UCLA study, newborns still in the hospital

00:01:52.532 --> 00:01:55.220
were shown patterns, patterns like this:

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.831
circle, cross, circle, cross.

00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:03.150
And then the pattern was changed: triangle, square.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.806
And by tracking an infant's gaze,

00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:09.110
we know that newborns as young as a day old

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.722
can notice and respond to disruptions in order.

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:13.140
It's remarkable.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.738
So from infancy through old age,

00:02:15.738 --> 00:02:18.110
the urge to solve unites us all,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.750
and I even found this photo on Instagram

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.904
of pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle

00:02:23.904 --> 00:02:26.130
with her morning coffee.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.801
Like.

00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:31.669
(Laughter)

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:36.210
Now, solving exists across all cultures.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.154
The American invention is the crossword puzzle,

00:02:39.154 --> 00:02:40.553
and this year we are celebrating

00:02:40.553 --> 00:02:43.226
the 100th anniversary of the crossword puzzle,

00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:45.733
first published in The New York World.

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:48.372
But many other cultures have
their signature puzzles as well.

00:02:48.372 --> 00:02:50.382
China gives us tangrams,

00:02:50.382 --> 00:02:52.427
which would test solvers' abilities

00:02:52.427 --> 00:02:55.567
to form shapes from the jumbled pieces.

00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:58.570
Chaos. Order.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.628
Order.

00:03:00.628 --> 00:03:03.823
And order.

00:03:03.823 --> 00:03:06.393
That one's my favorite, let's hear it again.

00:03:06.393 --> 00:03:08.064
Okay.

00:03:08.064 --> 00:03:09.840
And how about this puzzle

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.279
invented in 18th-century England:

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.330
the jigsaw puzzle.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.144
Is this not making order out of chaos?

00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:19.613
So as you can see,

00:03:19.613 --> 00:03:21.392
we are always solving.

00:03:21.392 --> 00:03:25.354
We are always trying to decode our world.

00:03:25.354 --> 00:03:26.884
It's an eternal quest.

00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:29.528
It's just like the one Cervantes wrote about

00:03:29.528 --> 00:03:30.979
in "Don Quixote,"

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.981
which by the way is the root of the word "quixotry,"

00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:34.804
the highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time,

00:03:34.804 --> 00:03:36.660
365 points.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.877
But anyway, "Don Quixote" is an important book.

00:03:39.877 --> 00:03:41.914
You guys have read "Don Quixote," yes?

00:03:41.914 --> 00:03:43.420
I'm seeing some heads nod.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.702
Come on guys, really?

00:03:44.702 --> 00:03:47.239
Who's read "Don Quixote?" Let's do this.
Raise your hands if you've read "Don Quixote."

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.349
There we go. Smart audience.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.063
Who's read "Don Quixote?" Get them up.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:54.276
Okay, good, because I need somebody smart here

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:55.478
because now I'm going to demonstrate

00:03:55.478 --> 00:03:57.350
with the help of one of you

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.686
just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is,

00:04:00.686 --> 00:04:03.185
just how wired to solve all of you really are,

00:04:03.185 --> 00:04:04.627
so I'm going to come into the audience

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:07.625
and find somebody to help me.

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:09.747
Let's see.

00:04:09.747 --> 00:04:13.639
Everybody's looking away all of a sudden.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.556
Can I? Would you? What is your name? Gwen.

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:19.997
I'm not a mind reader, I can see your name tag.

00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:24.310
Come with me, Gwen. Everyone give her 
a round of applause, make her feel welcome.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.982
Gwen, after you.

00:04:25.982 --> 00:04:27.864
(Applause)

00:04:27.864 --> 00:04:31.275
Are you so excited?

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:32.730
Did you know that your name is worth

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.328
eight points in Scrabble?

00:04:34.328 --> 00:04:38.615
Okay, stand right here, Gwen, right here.

00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:41.117
Now, Gwen, before we begin,

00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:43.726
I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle,

00:04:43.726 --> 00:04:45.263
which is here in this envelope,

00:04:45.263 --> 00:04:46.883
and I will not go near it. Okay?

00:04:46.883 --> 00:04:48.891
And over here we have a
drawing of some farm animals.

00:04:48.891 --> 00:04:50.251
You can see we have an owl, we have a horse,

00:04:50.251 --> 00:04:52.480
a donkey, a rooster, an ox, and a sheep,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.690
and then here, Gwen, we have

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.110
some fancy art store markers,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.450
colors like, can you see that word right there?

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.789
Gwen: Cobalt.
David Kwong: Cobalt, yes. Cobalt.

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.407
But we have a silver, a red, an emerald,

00:05:03.407 --> 00:05:04.865
and an amber marker,

00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:07.130
and Gwen, you are going to color this drawing

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.607
just like you were five years old,

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:09.715
one marker at a time.

00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:11.234
It's going to be a lot of fun.

00:05:11.234 --> 00:05:12.255
But I'm going to go over here.

00:05:12.255 --> 00:05:14.342
I don't want to see what you're doing.

00:05:14.342 --> 00:05:15.412
Okay, so don't start yet.

00:05:15.412 --> 00:05:16.839
Wait for me to get over here and close my eyes.

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:18.717
Now Gwen, are you ready?

00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:22.227
Pick up just one marker, pick up just one marker,

00:05:22.227 --> 00:05:23.612
and why don't you color in the horse for me?

00:05:23.612 --> 00:05:27.165
Color in the horse — big, big, big scribbles,

00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:30.123
broad strokes, don't worry about staying in the lines.

00:05:30.123 --> 00:05:31.399
All right. Great.

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:32.975
And why don't you take that marker and recap it

00:05:32.975 --> 00:05:34.905
and place it on the table for me.

00:05:34.905 --> 00:05:38.125
Okay, and pick up another marker out of the cup

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:40.575
and take off the cap

00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:42.641
and color in the donkey for me, color in the donkey.

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:45.709
Big scribbles.

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:47.943
Okay, cool, and re-cap that marker

00:05:47.943 --> 00:05:49.445
and place it on the table.

00:05:49.445 --> 00:05:51.723
And pick up another marker for me

00:05:51.723 --> 00:05:54.186
and take off the cap. Isn't this fun?

00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:55.513
And color in the owl for me.

00:05:55.513 --> 00:05:58.564
Color in the owl.

00:05:58.564 --> 00:06:01.050
Okay, and recap that marker

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.838
and pick up another marker out of the cup

00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:06.414
and color in the rooster for me, color in the rooster.

00:06:06.414 --> 00:06:07.838
Good, good, good, good, good.

00:06:07.838 --> 00:06:08.931
Big, big, big strokes. Good, good.

00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:11.196
Pick up another marker out of the cup

00:06:11.196 --> 00:06:14.693
and color in the ox for me. Color in the ox.

00:06:14.693 --> 00:06:15.956
Okay, good.

00:06:15.956 --> 00:06:18.406
A lot of color on that, and recap,
and place it on the table,

00:06:18.406 --> 00:06:21.110
and pick up another marker out of the cup.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.849
Oh, I'm out? Okay, I'm going to turn around.

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:29.109
Did I forget? Oh, I forgot my purple marker.

00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:30.452
This is still going to work, though.

00:06:30.452 --> 00:06:32.735
I think this is still going to work, mostly.

00:06:32.735 --> 00:06:35.888
So Gwen, I'm going to hand you this envelope.

00:06:35.888 --> 00:06:38.840
Don't open it yet. Do not open it yet,

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.231
but I am going to write down your choices

00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:43.390
so that everybody can see

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.663
the choices that you made.

00:06:44.663 --> 00:06:53.046
Okay, great. So we have a cobalt horse,

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:58.452
amber owl,

00:06:58.452 --> 00:07:03.233
a silver ox,

00:07:03.233 --> 00:07:06.675
yes, okay, a red donkey,

00:07:06.675 --> 00:07:10.050
and what was the emerald color? A rooster.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.120
An emerald rooster. Okay.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.286
Now for the moment of truth, Gwen,

00:07:16.286 --> 00:07:17.971
we're going to take a look in that envelope.

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:19.886
Why don't you open it up and remove

00:07:19.886 --> 00:07:21.178
the one piece of paper from inside

00:07:21.178 --> 00:07:22.207
and hand it to me,

00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:26.910
and we will see if it matches your choices.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.345
Yes, I think it does.

00:07:28.345 --> 00:07:29.909
We have a cobalt horse, we have a red donkey,

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:32.206
we have an amber owl, we have
an emerald rooster, a silver ox,

00:07:32.206 --> 00:07:34.217
I forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep,

00:07:34.217 --> 00:07:36.932
but that's a pretty amazing
coincidence, don't you think?

00:07:36.932 --> 00:07:41.113
Gwen, well done. That's beautiful. (Applause)

00:07:41.113 --> 00:07:42.880
I'll take that back from you.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.744
So ladies and gentlemen, how is this possible?

00:07:46.744 --> 00:07:49.561
How is this possible? Well, could it be

00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:53.823
that Gwen's brain is so wired to solve

00:07:53.823 --> 00:07:56.669
that she decoded hidden messages?

00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:58.716
Well this is the puzzle I present to you.

00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:00.696
Could there be order

00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:03.700
in the chaos that I created?

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.440
Let's take a closer look.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.451
Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces?

00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:15.208
What image did it ultimately become? A cobalt horse.

00:08:15.208 --> 00:08:16.985
The plot thickens.

00:08:16.985 --> 00:08:19.190
And then we played a game of tangrams

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:24.180
with an emerald rooster.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.378
That one's my favorite.

00:08:26.378 --> 00:08:32.633
And then we had an experiment with a silver ox.

00:08:32.633 --> 00:08:35.333
And Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee

00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:39.162
out of an amber owl.

00:08:39.162 --> 00:08:40.841
Thank you, Katy, for taking that photo for me.

00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:42.806
Oh, and there's one more, there's one more.

00:08:42.806 --> 00:08:46.234
I believe you colored a red donkey, Gwen.

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:47.864
Ladies and gentlemen, could you raise your hands

00:08:47.864 --> 00:08:50.284
for me if you've read "Don Quixote?"

00:08:50.284 --> 00:08:53.179
Who's read "Don Quixote?" (Laughter)

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:54.955
But wait, but wait, wait, wait, wait, there's more.

00:08:54.955 --> 00:08:56.450
There's more.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.209
Gwen, I was so confident

00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:01.133
that you were going to make these choices

00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:03.771
that I made another prediction,

00:09:03.771 --> 00:09:07.101
and I put it in an even more indelible place,

00:09:07.101 --> 00:09:09.519
and it's right here.

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:10.801
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:14.379
we have today's New York Times.

00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:18.204
The date is March 18th, 2014.

00:09:18.204 --> 00:09:20.050
Many of you in the first couple of rows

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.170
have it underneath your seats as well.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.380
Really dig. We hid them under there.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.921
See if you can fish out the newspaper

00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:28.319
and open up to the arts section

00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:31.782
and you will find the crossword puzzle,

00:09:31.782 --> 00:09:33.345
and the crossword puzzle today

00:09:33.345 --> 00:09:35.404
was written by yours truly.

00:09:35.404 --> 00:09:36.470
You can see my name above the grid.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.003
I'm going to give this to you, Gwen, to take a look.

00:09:39.003 --> 00:09:43.196
And I will also put it up on the screen.

00:09:43.196 --> 00:09:45.078
Now let's take a look

00:09:45.078 --> 00:09:48.385
at another piece of the puzzle.

00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:51.603
If you look at the first clue for 1-across,

00:09:51.603 --> 00:09:54.899
it starts with the letter C, for corrupt,

00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:57.825
and just below that we have an O, for outfielder,

00:09:57.825 --> 00:10:00.771
and if you keep reading the
first letters of the clues down,

00:10:00.771 --> 00:10:03.572
you get cobalt horse,

00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:07.060
amber owl, silver ox,

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.558
red donkey, and emerald rooster.

00:10:10.558 --> 00:10:12.164
(Applause)

00:10:12.164 --> 00:10:17.735
That's pretty cool, right?

00:10:17.735 --> 00:10:19.446
It's The New York Times.

00:10:19.446 --> 00:10:21.022
But wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

00:10:21.022 --> 00:10:22.544
Oh, Gwen,

00:10:22.544 --> 00:10:25.148
do you recall how I forgot my purple marker,

00:10:25.148 --> 00:10:28.195
and you were unable to color the sheep?

00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:29.648
Well, if you keep reading

00:10:29.648 --> 00:10:31.279
starting with 25-down,

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:32.185
it says,

00:10:32.185 --> 00:10:33.958
"Oh, by the way,

00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:38.270
the sheep can be left blank."

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.706
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:42.706 --> 00:10:44.280
But wait, wait, wait, there's one more thing,

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.483
there's one more thing,

00:10:45.483 --> 00:10:48.322
there's one final piece of the puzzle.

00:10:48.322 --> 00:10:52.641
Gwen, I am so grateful for your choices

00:10:52.641 --> 00:10:54.632
because if we take a look

00:10:54.632 --> 00:10:56.863
at the first letters of your combinations,

00:10:56.863 --> 00:10:59.875
we get "C-H-A-O-S" for chaos

00:10:59.875 --> 00:11:02.698
and "O-R-D-E-R" for order.

00:11:02.698 --> 00:11:04.228
That's chaos and order.

00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:05.904
We've all made order out of chaos.

00:11:05.904 --> 00:11:07.907
So ladies and gentlemen, the next time

00:11:07.907 --> 00:11:09.459
you find yourself with a puzzle,

00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:12.501
whether it's in your life or in your work,

00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:13.682
or maybe it's at the Sunday morning

00:11:13.682 --> 00:11:16.090
breakfast table with The New York Times,

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.932
remember, you are all wired to solve.

00:11:19.932 --> 00:11:21.524
Thank you.

00:11:21.524 --> 00:11:25.524
(Applause)
