00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:02.684
Today,

00:00:02.684 --> 00:00:04.324
a baffled lady observed

00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:06.316
the shell where my soul dwells

00:00:06.316 --> 00:00:09.457
And announced that I'm

00:00:09.457 --> 00:00:11.364
"articulate"

00:00:11.364 --> 00:00:13.702
Which means that when it comes

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:15.697
to enunciation and diction

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:16.703
I don't even think of it

00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:19.390
‘Cause I’m "articulate"

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.970
So when my professor asks a question

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.129
And my answer is tainted with a connotation

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:25.477
of urbanized suggestion

00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:27.943
There’s no misdirected intention

00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:28.920
Pay attention

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.258
‘Cause I’m “articulate”

00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:34.815
So when my father asks, “Wha’ kinda ting is dis?”

00:00:34.815 --> 00:00:37.953
My “articulate” answer never goes amiss

00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:41.469
I say “father, this is the impending problem at hand”

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:42.796
And when I’m on the block

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:44.491
I switch it up just because I can

00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:47.129
So when my boy says, “What’s good with you son?”

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.539
I just say, “I jus’ fall out wit dem people but I done!”

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.131
And sometimes in class

00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:57.060
I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.725
“Yo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples”

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:02.890
Yes, I have decided to treat

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.952
all three of my languages as equals

00:01:04.952 --> 00:01:08.950
Because I’m “articulate”

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.371
But who controls articulation?

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.525
Because the English language
is a multifaceted oration

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:16.344
Subject to indefinite transformation

00:01:16.344 --> 00:01:19.957
Now you may think that it is
ignorant to speak broken English

00:01:19.957 --> 00:01:23.114
But I’m here to tell you that
even “articulate” Americans

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:25.114
sound foolish to the British

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:28.363
So when my Professor comes on
the block and says, “Hello”

00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:31.000
I stop him and say “Noooo …

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.144
You’re being inarticulate …

00:01:33.144 --> 00:01:35.307
the proper way is to say ‘what’s good’”

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:38.922
Now you may think that’s too hood, that’s not cool

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:41.900
But I’m here to tell you that
even our language has rules


00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.512
So when Mommy mocks me and says

00:01:44.512 --> 00:01:46.770
“ya’ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store”

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.756
I say “Mommy, no, that sentence is not following the law

00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:55.447
Never does the word "madd" go 
before a present participle

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:57.950
That’s simply the principle of this English”

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.620
If I had the vocal capacity I would

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.674
sing this from every mountaintop,

00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:03.950
From every suburbia, and every hood

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.503
‘Cause the only God of language is
the one recorded in the Genesis

00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:09.220
Of this world saying “it is good"

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.791
So I may not always come before you

00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:13.185
with excellency of speech

00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:15.716
But do not judge me by my language and assume

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:17.235
That I’m too ignorant to teach

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:18.785
‘Cause I speak three tongues

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:19.933
One for each:

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:21.678
Home, school and friends

00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:23.882
I’m a tri-lingual orator

00:02:23.882 --> 00:02:25.851
Sometimes I’m consistent with my language now

00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:27.810
Then switch it up so I don’t bore later

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.687
Sometimes I fight back two tongues

00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:31.622
While I use the other one in the classroom

00:02:31.622 --> 00:02:33.547
And when I mistakenly mix them up

00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:37.040
I feel crazy like … I’m cooking in the bathroom

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.632
I know that I had to borrow your language

00:02:41.632 --> 00:02:44.477
because mines was stolen

00:02:44.477 --> 00:02:48.377
But you can’t expect me to speak your history wholly

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:49.879
while mines is broken

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.398
These words are spoken

00:02:51.398 --> 00:02:53.705
By someone who is simply fed up with

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:56.325
the Eurocentric ideals of this season

00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:59.808
And the reason I speak a composite
version of your language

00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:03.560
Is because mines was raped
away along with my history

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.790
I speak broken English so the
profusing gashes can remind us

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.050
That our current state is not a mystery

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.258
I’m so tired of the negative images
that are driving my people mad

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:19.501
So unless you’ve seen it rob
a bank stop calling my hair bad

00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:23.157
I’m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity

00:03:23.157 --> 00:03:25.710
So don’t call it good unless your hair is known

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.255
for donating to charity

00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:32.182
As much as has been raped away from our people

00:03:32.182 --> 00:03:36.121
How can you expect me to treat
their imprint on your language

00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:38.735
As anything less than equal

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:40.607
Let there be no confusion

00:03:40.607 --> 00:03:42.421
Let there be no hesitation

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.485
This is not a promotion of ignorance

00:03:44.485 --> 00:03:47.930
This is a linguistic celebration

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.009
That’s why I put "tri-lingual" on my last job application

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.740
I can help to diversify your consumer market

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.372
is all I wanted them to know

00:03:57.372 --> 00:03:59.105
And when they call me for the interview

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:00.615
I’ll be more than happy to show that

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:01.350
I can say:

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.563
“What’s good”

00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:03.548
“Whatagwan”

00:04:03.548 --> 00:04:06.452
And of course …“Hello”

00:04:06.452 --> 00:04:09.126
Because I’m “articulate”

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:10.899
Thank you.

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:12.284
(Applause)
