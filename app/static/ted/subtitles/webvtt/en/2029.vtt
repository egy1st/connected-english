00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.395
Twenty-three years ago,

00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:06.150
at the age of 19,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.451
I shot and killed a man.

00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:11.594
I was a young drug dealer

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:13.963
with a quick temper

00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:18.018
and a semi-automatic pistol.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.789
But that wasn't the end of my story.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.930
In fact, it was beginning,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.105
and the 23 years since

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:30.827
is a story of acknowledgment,

00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:34.310
apology and atonement.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.733
But it didn't happen in the way

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:39.027
that you might imagine or think.

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:40.485
These things occurred in my life

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:42.628
in a way that was surprising,

00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:44.263
especially to me.

00:00:44.263 --> 00:00:47.404
See, like many of you,

00:00:47.404 --> 00:00:49.978
growing up, I was an honor roll student,

00:00:49.978 --> 00:00:51.321
a scholarship student,

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:53.925
with dreams of becoming a doctor.

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:56.556
But things went dramatically wrong

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.730
when my parents separated

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.567
and eventually divorced.

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:05.417
The actual events are pretty straightforward.

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:07.865
At the age of 17,

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:09.510
I got shot three times

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.135
standing on the corner of my block in Detroit.

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:16.830
My friend rushed me to the hospital.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.054
Doctors pulled the bullets out,

00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:21.845
patched me up,

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:26.216
and sent me back to the same 
neighborhood where I got shot.

00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:28.971
Throughout this ordeal,

00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:31.031
no one hugged me,

00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:33.401
no one counseled me,

00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:36.341
no one told me I would be okay.

00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:39.265
No one told me that I would live in fear,

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.878
that I would become paranoid,

00:01:41.878 --> 00:01:44.871
or that I would react hyper-violently

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.249
to being shot.

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:50.070
No one told me that one day,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.127
I would become the person behind the trigger.

00:01:54.127 --> 00:01:56.801
Fourteen months later,

00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:59.411
at 2 a.m.,

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.047
I fired the shots

00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:04.900
that caused a man's death.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.810
When I entered prison,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.317
I was bitter, I was angry, I was hurt.

00:02:12.317 --> 00:02:15.287
I didn't want to take responsibility.

00:02:15.287 --> 00:02:17.339
I blamed everybody from my parents

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:20.312
to the system.

00:02:20.312 --> 00:02:22.524
I rationalized my decision to shoot

00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.963
because in the hood where I come from,

00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:26.589
it's better to be the shooter

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.901
than the person getting shot.

00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:33.223
As I sat in my cold cell,

00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:34.870
I felt helpless,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.257
unloved and abandoned.

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:42.135
I felt like nobody cared,

00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:44.154
and I reacted

00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:47.165
with hostility to my confinement.

00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:48.303
And I found myself getting

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.618
deeper and deeper into trouble.

00:02:50.618 --> 00:02:53.398
I ran black market stores,

00:02:53.398 --> 00:02:56.117
I loan sharked,

00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:58.183
and I sold drugs that were illegally smuggled

00:02:58.183 --> 00:03:00.044
into the prison.

00:03:00.044 --> 00:03:01.614
I had in fact become

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:04.295
what the warden of the Michigan Reformatory called

00:03:04.295 --> 00:03:07.132
"the worst of the worst."

00:03:07.132 --> 00:03:09.457
And because of my activity,

00:03:09.457 --> 00:03:12.149
I landed in solitary confinement

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.578
for seven and a half years

00:03:14.578 --> 00:03:17.790
out of my incarceration.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.459
Now as I see it, solitary confinement

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.399
is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.298
you can find yourself,

00:03:24.298 --> 00:03:27.189
but find myself I did.

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.700
One day, I was pacing my cell,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.217
when an officer came and delivered mail.

00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:36.954
I looked at a couple of letters

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:38.868
before I looked at the letter

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:41.930
that had my son's squiggly handwriting on it.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.367
And anytime I would get a letter from my son,

00:03:43.367 --> 00:03:45.272
it was like a ray of light

00:03:45.272 --> 00:03:48.029
in the darkest place you can imagine.

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:51.844
And on this particular day, I opened this letter,

00:03:51.844 --> 00:03:54.950
and in capital letters, he wrote,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.205
"My mama told me why you was in prison:

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:00.899
murder."

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:02.818
He said, "Dad, don't kill.

00:04:02.818 --> 00:04:08.265
Jesus watches what you do. Pray to Him."

00:04:08.265 --> 00:04:10.100
Now, I wasn't religious at that time,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.807
nor am I religious now,

00:04:11.807 --> 00:04:14.291
but it was something so profound

00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:17.053
about my son's words.

00:04:17.063 --> 00:04:18.685
They made me examine things about my life

00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:20.621
that I hadn't considered.

00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:22.557
It was the first time in my life

00:04:22.557 --> 00:04:24.529
that I had actually thought about the fact

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:28.195
that my son would see me as a murderer.

00:04:28.195 --> 00:04:30.249
I sat back on my bunk

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.268
and I reflected on something I had read

00:04:32.268 --> 00:04:34.865
in [Plato],

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:36.840
where Socrates stated in "Apology"

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.111
that the unexamined life isn't worth living.

00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:46.943
At that point is when the transformation began.

00:04:46.943 --> 00:04:49.863
But it didn't come easy.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.764
One of the things I realized,

00:04:53.764 --> 00:04:55.921
which was part of the transformation,

00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:59.663
was that there were four key things.

00:04:59.663 --> 00:05:01.970
The first thing was,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.283
I had great mentors.

00:05:04.283 --> 00:05:06.159
Now, I know some of you all are probably thinking,

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.328
how did you find a great mentor in prison?

00:05:09.328 --> 00:05:12.193
But in my case,

00:05:12.193 --> 00:05:13.423
some of my mentors

00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:15.300
who are serving life sentences

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.009
were some of the best people
to ever come into my life,

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.273
because they forced me to look at my life honestly,

00:05:21.273 --> 00:05:23.098
and they forced me to challenge myself

00:05:23.098 --> 00:05:25.613
about my decision making.

00:05:25.613 --> 00:05:29.867
The second thing was literature.

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:31.610
Prior to going to prison,

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.607
I didn't know that there were so many brilliant

00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:36.888
black poets, authors and philosophers,

00:05:36.888 --> 00:05:39.907
and then I had the great fortune

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:44.074
of encountering Malcolm X's autobiography,

00:05:44.074 --> 00:05:48.621
and it shattered every
stereotype I had about myself.

00:05:48.621 --> 00:05:51.062
The third thing was family.

00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:55.738
For 19 years, my father stood by my side

00:05:55.738 --> 00:05:58.167
with an unshakable faith,

00:05:58.167 --> 00:05:59.831
because he believed that I had what it took

00:05:59.831 --> 00:06:02.125
to turn my life around.

00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:05.018
I also met an amazing woman

00:06:05.018 --> 00:06:08.452
who is now the mother of
my two-year-old son Sekou,

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:10.680
and she taught me how to love myself

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.958
in a healthy way.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.654
The final thing was writing.

00:06:17.654 --> 00:06:19.068
When I got that letter from my son,

00:06:19.068 --> 00:06:21.278
I began to write a journal

00:06:21.278 --> 00:06:24.079
about things I had experienced in my childhood

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:26.872
and in prison,

00:06:26.872 --> 00:06:30.138
and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea

00:06:30.138 --> 00:06:33.106
of atonement.

00:06:33.106 --> 00:06:35.188
Earlier in my incarceration, I had received

00:06:35.188 --> 00:06:38.995
a letter from one of the relatives of my victim,

00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:41.840
and in that letter,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.685
she told me she forgave me,

00:06:43.685 --> 00:06:45.634
because she realized I was a young child

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:46.971
who had been abused

00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:48.763
and had been through some hardships

00:06:48.763 --> 00:06:51.501
and just made a series of poor decisions.

00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:53.972
It was the first time in my life

00:06:53.972 --> 00:07:01.701
that I ever felt open to forgiving myself.

00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:02.945
One of the things that happened

00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:05.268
after that experience is that

00:07:05.268 --> 00:07:07.156
I thought about the other men who were incarcerated

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:08.968
alongside of me,

00:07:08.968 --> 00:07:11.890
and how much I wanted to share this with them.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.644
And so I started talking to them about

00:07:13.644 --> 00:07:15.571
some of their experiences,

00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:17.053
and I was devastated to realize

00:07:17.053 --> 00:07:20.431
that most of them came from
the same abusive environments,

00:07:20.431 --> 00:07:23.970
And most of them wanted help
and they wanted to turn it around,

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.710
but unfortunately the system

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.928
that currently holds 2.5 million people in prison

00:07:28.928 --> 00:07:31.128
is designed to warehouse

00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:35.420
as opposed to rehabilitate or transform.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.311
So I made it up in my mind

00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:39.065
that if I was ever released from prison

00:07:39.065 --> 00:07:41.522
that I would do everything in my power

00:07:41.522 --> 00:07:45.223
to help change that.

00:07:45.223 --> 00:07:47.989
In 2010, I walked out of prison

00:07:47.989 --> 00:07:51.067
for the first time after two decades.

00:07:51.067 --> 00:07:52.655
Now imagine, if you will,

00:07:52.655 --> 00:07:55.237
Fred Flintstone walking into an episode

00:07:55.237 --> 00:07:57.620
of "The Jetsons."

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.555
That was pretty much what my life was like.

00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:03.870
For the first time, I was exposed to the Internet,

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.606
social media,

00:08:05.606 --> 00:08:09.743
cars that talk like KITT from "Knight Rider."

00:08:09.743 --> 00:08:11.527
But the thing that fascinated me the most

00:08:11.527 --> 00:08:13.310
was phone technology.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.582
See, when I went to prison,

00:08:14.582 --> 00:08:16.357
our car phones were this big

00:08:16.357 --> 00:08:18.958
and required two people to carry them.

00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.046
So imagine what it was like when I first grabbed

00:08:21.046 --> 00:08:23.172
my little Blackberry

00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:25.123
and I started learning how to text.

00:08:25.123 --> 00:08:26.790
But the thing is, the people around me,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.386
they didn't realize that I had no idea

00:08:28.386 --> 00:08:31.080
what all these abbreviated texts meant,

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.110
like LOL, OMG, LMAO,

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.852
until one day I was having a conversation

00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:40.108
with one of my friends via text,

00:08:40.108 --> 00:08:44.139
and I asked him to do something,
and he responded back, "K."

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:47.318
And I was like, "What is K?"

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:49.280
And he was like, "K is okay."

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.279
So in my head, I was like,

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:53.297
"Well what the hell is wrong with K?"

00:08:53.297 --> 00:08:55.810
And so I text him a question mark.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.481
And he said, "K = okay."

00:08:59.481 --> 00:09:04.170
And so I tap back, "FU." (Laughter)

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.926
And then he texts back, and he asks me

00:09:05.926 --> 00:09:07.600
why was I cussing him out.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.260
And I said, "LOL FU,"

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.959
as in, I finally understand.

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:13.996
(Laughter)

00:09:13.996 --> 00:09:17.261
And so fast forward three years,

00:09:17.261 --> 00:09:19.135
I'm doing relatively good.

00:09:19.135 --> 00:09:21.813
I have a fellowship at MIT Media Lab,

00:09:21.813 --> 00:09:25.030
I work for an amazing company called BMe,

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.360
I teach at the University of Michigan,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.337
but it's been a struggle

00:09:29.337 --> 00:09:30.800
because I realize that there are more

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.435
men and women coming home

00:09:32.435 --> 00:09:35.596
who are not going to be
afforded those opportunities.

00:09:35.596 --> 00:09:37.401
I've been blessed to work with some amazing

00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:40.085
men and women,

00:09:40.085 --> 00:09:41.847
helping others reenter society,

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:46.060
and one of them is my friend named Calvin Evans.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.015
He served 24 years for a crime he didn't commit.

00:09:49.015 --> 00:09:52.783
He's 45 years old. He's currently enrolled in college.

00:09:52.783 --> 00:09:54.507
And one of the things that we talked about

00:09:54.507 --> 00:09:56.219
is the three things that I found important

00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:57.839
in my personal transformation,

00:09:57.839 --> 00:09:59.778
the first being acknowledgment.

00:09:59.778 --> 00:10:02.204
I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others.

00:10:02.204 --> 00:10:05.000
I also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.421
The second thing was apologizing.

00:10:07.421 --> 00:10:09.571
I had to apologize to the people I had hurt.

00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:11.643
Even though I had no expectations
of them accepting it,

00:10:11.643 --> 00:10:14.395
it was important to do because it was the right thing.

00:10:14.395 --> 00:10:17.354
But I also had to apologize to myself.

00:10:17.354 --> 00:10:20.171
The third thing was atoning.

00:10:20.171 --> 00:10:21.854
For me, atoning meant

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:23.447
going back into my community

00:10:23.447 --> 00:10:24.990
and working with at-risk youth

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.790
who were on the same path,

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.530
but also becoming at one with myself.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.294
Through my experience of being locked up,

00:10:32.294 --> 00:10:34.475
one of the things I discovered is this:

00:10:34.475 --> 00:10:35.691
the majority of men and women

00:10:35.691 --> 00:10:39.112
who are incarcerated are redeemable,

00:10:39.112 --> 00:10:40.372
and the fact is,

00:10:40.372 --> 00:10:42.723
90 percent of the men and
women who are incarcerated

00:10:42.723 --> 00:10:45.411
will at some point return to the community,

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.326
and we have a role in determining what kind

00:10:47.326 --> 00:10:50.945
of men and women return to our community.

00:10:50.945 --> 00:10:53.556
My wish today

00:10:53.556 --> 00:10:57.209
is that we will embrace

00:10:57.209 --> 00:10:59.358
a more empathetic approach

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:02.578
toward how we deal with mass incarceration,

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:03.722
that we will do away with

00:11:03.722 --> 00:11:06.037
the lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key mentality,

00:11:06.037 --> 00:11:09.960
because it's proven it doesn't work.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.413
My journey is a unique journey,

00:11:12.413 --> 00:11:15.078
but it doesn't have to be that way.

00:11:15.078 --> 00:11:17.484
Anybody can have a transformation

00:11:17.484 --> 00:11:20.324
if we create the space for that to happen.

00:11:20.324 --> 00:11:22.086
So what I'm asking today

00:11:22.086 --> 00:11:23.793
is that you envision

00:11:23.793 --> 00:11:26.133
a world where men and women

00:11:26.133 --> 00:11:29.829
aren't held hostage to their pasts,

00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:31.262
where misdeeds and mistakes

00:11:31.262 --> 00:11:34.030
don't define you for the rest of your life.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.221
I think collectively, we can create that reality,

00:11:37.221 --> 00:11:38.924
and I hope you do too.

00:11:38.924 --> 00:11:40.690
Thank you.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.773
(Applause)
