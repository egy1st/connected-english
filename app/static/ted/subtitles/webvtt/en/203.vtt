00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We are going to talk today about the sequel of "Inconvenient Truth."

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's time again to talk about "Inconvenient Truth,"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a truth that everyone is concerned about,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but nobody is willing to talk about.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Somebody has to take the lead, and I decided to do it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If you are scared by global warming,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
wait until we learn about local warming.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We will talk today about local warming.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Important health message: blogging may be hazardous to your health,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
especially if you are a male.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This message is given as a public service.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Blogging affects your posture. We start with the posture.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This is the posture of ladies who are not blogging;

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
this is the posture of ladies who are blogging.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
(Laughter)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This is the natural posture of a man sitting,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
squatting for ventilation purposes.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
(Laughter)

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And this is the natural posture of a standing man,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and I think this picture inspired Chris to insert me

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
into the lateral thinking session.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This is male blogging posture sitting, and the result is,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
"For greater comfort,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
when working on laptop.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
However, they will adopt a less natural posture

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
in order to balance it on their laps,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which resulted in a significant rise of body heat

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
between their thighs." This is the issue of local warming.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
(Laughter)

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is a very serious newspaper; it's Times of England --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
very serious. This is a very --

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
(Laughter)

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
-- gentlemen and ladies, be serious.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This is a very serious research, that you should read the underline.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And be careful, your genes are in danger.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Will geeks become endangered species?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The fact: population growth in countries with high laptop --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
(Laughter)

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I need Hans Rosling to give me a graph.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
(Applause)

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Global warming fun.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
(Laughter)

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But let's keep things in proportion.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
How to take care in five easy steps:

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
first of all, you can use natural ventilation. You can use body breath.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You should stay cool with the appropriate clothing.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
You should care about your posture -- this is not right.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Can you extract from Chris another minute and a half for me,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
because I have a video I have to show you.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
(Applause)

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You are great. This is the correct posture.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Another benefit of Wi-Fi, we learned yesterday about the benefits of Wi-Fi.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Wi-Fi enables you to avoid the processor. And there are some enhanced

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
protection measures, which I would like to share with you,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and I would like, in a minute, to thank Philips for helping.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
This is a research which was done in '86, but it's still valid.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Scrotal temperature reflects intratesticular temperature

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and is lowered by shaving.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
By the way, I must admit, my English is not so good,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I didn't know what is scrotal; I understand it's a scrotum.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I guess in plural it's scrotal, like medium and media.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Digital scrotum, digital media.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And only last year I recognized that I'm a proud scrotum owner.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
(Laughter)

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And this research is being precipitated by the U.S. government,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Video: Man: The Philips Bodygroom has a sleek,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
ergonomic design for a safe and easy way to trim

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
those scruffy underarm hairs, the untidy curls on and around your

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
[bleep], as well as the hard to reach locks on the underside of your

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
[bleep] and [bleep]. Once you use the Bodygroom, the world looks different.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And so does your [bleep]. These days, with a hair-free back,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
well-groomed shoulders and an extra optical inch on my [bleep],

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
well, let's just say life has gotten pretty darn cozy.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Yossi Vardi: This is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
known as the optical inch by Philips. Let's applaud Philips --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
(Applause)

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
-- for this gesture for humanity.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And this is how they are promoting the product. This is --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I didn't touch it, this is original.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Laptop use to solve overpopulation. And if everything failed,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
there are some secondary uses.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And then our next talk, our next TED if you invite me

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
will be why you should not carry a cell phone in your pocket.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And this is what the young generation says.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
(Applause)

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And I just want to show you that I'm not just preaching,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
but I also practice.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
(Laughter)

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
4 am in the morning.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Laughter)

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
You cannot use this picture.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
(Applause)

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Now, I have some mini TED Prizes, this is the Philips Bodygroom,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
one for our leader.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
(Applause)

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Anybody feels threatened, anybody really need it?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
(Laughter)

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Any lady, any lady? Thank you very much.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
(Applause)
