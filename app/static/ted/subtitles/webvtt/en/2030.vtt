00:00:00.535 --> 00:00:03.980
I am a computer science and engineering
professor here at Carnegie Mellon,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.228
and my research focuses on
usable privacy and security,

00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:10.996
and so my friends like to give me examples

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:13.198
of their frustrations with computing systems,

00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:16.552
especially frustrations related to

00:00:16.552 --> 00:00:20.664
unusable privacy and security.

00:00:20.664 --> 00:00:23.375
So passwords are something that I hear a lot about.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:26.255
A lot of people are frustrated with passwords,

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:27.949
and it's bad enough

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.593
when you have to have one really good password

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:32.415
that you can remember

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:35.309
but nobody else is going to be able to guess.

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.946
But what do you do when you have accounts

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:38.754
on a hundred different systems

00:00:38.754 --> 00:00:41.030
and you're supposed to have a unique password

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.067
for each of these systems?

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:46.251
It's tough.

00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:48.010
At Carnegie Mellon, they used to make it

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.309
actually pretty easy for us

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.046
to remember our passwords.

00:00:51.046 --> 00:00:53.449
The password requirement up through 2009

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.828
was just that you had to have a password

00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:58.039
with at least one character.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.927
Pretty easy. But then they changed things,

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:03.597
and at the end of 2009, they announced

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:05.973
that we were going to have a new policy,

00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:07.836
and this new policy required

00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:10.517
passwords that were at least eight characters long,

00:01:10.517 --> 00:01:12.292
with an uppercase letter, lowercase letter,

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:13.580
a digit, a symbol,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.218
you couldn't use the same
character more than three times,

00:01:16.218 --> 00:01:18.652
and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary.

00:01:18.652 --> 00:01:20.834
Now, when they implemented this new policy,

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.144
a lot of people, my colleagues and friends,

00:01:23.144 --> 00:01:24.998
came up to me and they said, "Wow,

00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:26.510
now that's really unusable.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.703
Why are they doing this to us,

00:01:27.703 --> 00:01:29.414
and why didn't you stop them?"

00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:30.770
And I said, "Well, you know what?

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.278
They didn't ask me."

00:01:32.278 --> 00:01:35.743
But I got curious, and I decided to go talk

00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:37.680
to the people in charge of our computer systems

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.511
and find out what led them to introduce

00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.359
this new policy,

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:43.943
and they said that the university

00:01:43.943 --> 00:01:46.309
had joined a consortium of universities,

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:48.943
and one of the requirements of membership

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:51.191
was that we had to have stronger passwords

00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:53.463
that complied with some new requirements,

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:55.567
and these requirements were that our passwords

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:57.171
had to have a lot of entropy.

00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:59.449
Now entropy is a complicated term,

00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:02.247
but basically it measures the strength of passwords.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.226
But the thing is, there isn't actually

00:02:04.226 --> 00:02:06.175
a standard measure of entropy.

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:08.574
Now, the National Institute
of Standards and Technology

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:10.127
has a set of guidelines

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:12.695
which have some rules of thumb

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:14.135
for measuring entropy,

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:17.030
but they don't have anything too specific,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.367
and the reason they only have rules of thumb

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:22.503
is it turns out they don't actually have any good data

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:24.023
on passwords.

00:02:24.023 --> 00:02:26.335
In fact, their report states,

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:28.663
"Unfortunately, we do not have much data

00:02:28.663 --> 00:02:31.505
on the passwords users
choose under particular rules.

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:33.838
NIST would like to obtain more data

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:36.300
on the passwords users actually choose,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.763
but system administrators
are understandably reluctant

00:02:38.763 --> 00:02:41.703
to reveal password data to others."

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:44.800
So this is a problem, but our research group

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.940
looked at it as an opportunity.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.040
We said, "Well, there's a need
for good password data.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.188
Maybe we can collect some good password data

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:54.892
and actually advance the state of the art here.

00:02:54.892 --> 00:02:56.564
So the first thing we did is,

00:02:56.564 --> 00:02:58.120
we got a bag of candy bars

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.206
and we walked around campus

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:02.004
and talked to students, faculty and staff,

00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:03.534
and asked them for information

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.086
about their passwords.

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:08.090
Now we didn't say, "Give us your password."

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.751
No, we just asked them about their password.

00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:12.229
How long is it? Does it have a digit?

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:13.297
Does it have a symbol?

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:15.342
And were you annoyed at having to create

00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:18.086
a new one last week?

00:03:18.086 --> 00:03:21.292
So we got results from 470 students,

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:22.263
faculty and staff,

00:03:22.263 --> 00:03:24.777
and indeed we confirmed that the new policy

00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:26.230
was very annoying,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.022
but we also found that people said

00:03:28.022 --> 00:03:31.152
they felt more secure with these new passwords.

00:03:31.152 --> 00:03:33.458
We found that most people knew

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:35.610
they were not supposed to
write their password down,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.001
and only 13 percent of them did,

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:40.417
but disturbingly, 80 percent of people

00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:42.541
said they were reusing their password.

00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:44.337
Now, this is actually more dangerous

00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:46.359
than writing your password down,

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.920
because it makes you much
more susceptible to attackers.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.038
So if you have to, write your passwords down,

00:03:53.038 --> 00:03:54.837
but don't reuse them.

00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:56.588
We also found some interesting things

00:03:56.588 --> 00:03:59.549
about the symbols people use in passwords.

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.348
So CMU allows 32 possible symbols,

00:04:02.348 --> 00:04:04.781
but as you can see, there's only a small number

00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:06.583
that most people are using,

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:09.524
so we're not actually getting very much strength

00:04:09.524 --> 00:04:11.990
from the symbols in our passwords.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.701
So this was a really interesting study,

00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:17.165
and now we had data from 470 people,

00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:18.470
but in the scheme of things,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.050
that's really not very much password data,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.495
and so we looked around to see

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:25.055
where could we find additional password data?

00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:27.231
So it turns out there are a lot of people

00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:29.433
going around stealing passwords,

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:31.910
and they often go and post these passwords

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.247
on the Internet.

00:04:33.247 --> 00:04:34.920
So we were able to get access

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.890
to some of these stolen password sets.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.218
This is still not really ideal for research, though,

00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:43.255
because it's not entirely clear

00:04:43.255 --> 00:04:45.439
where all of these passwords came from,

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.681
or exactly what policies were in effect

00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:49.789
when people created these passwords.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.341
So we wanted to find some better source of data.

00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:54.975
So we decided that one thing we could do

00:04:54.975 --> 00:04:57.104
is we could do a study and have people

00:04:57.104 --> 00:05:00.344
actually create passwords for our study.

00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:03.165
So we used a service called
Amazon Mechanical Turk,

00:05:03.165 --> 00:05:05.499
and this is a service where you can post

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:07.803
a small job online that takes a minute,

00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:09.303
a few minutes, an hour,

00:05:09.303 --> 00:05:11.887
and pay people, a penny, ten cents, a few dollars,

00:05:11.887 --> 00:05:13.233
to do a task for you,

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:15.355
and then you pay them through Amazon.com.

00:05:15.355 --> 00:05:17.649
So we paid people about 50 cents

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:20.245
to create a password following our rules

00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:21.655
and answering a survey,

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:24.180
and then we paid them again to come back

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.251
two days later and log in

00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:28.825
using their password and answering another survey.

00:05:28.825 --> 00:05:33.289
So we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords,

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.984
and we gave people a bunch of different policies

00:05:35.984 --> 00:05:37.492
to create passwords with.

00:05:37.492 --> 00:05:39.402
So some people had a pretty easy policy,

00:05:39.402 --> 00:05:40.941
we call it Basic8,

00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:43.087
and here the only rule was that your password

00:05:43.087 --> 00:05:46.503
had to have at least eight characters.

00:05:46.503 --> 00:05:48.754
Then some people had a much harder policy,

00:05:48.754 --> 00:05:51.291
and this was very similar to the CMU policy,

00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:53.225
that it had to have eight characters

00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:55.601
including uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol,

00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:57.990
and pass a dictionary check.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.325
And one of the other policies we tried,

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:00.595
and there were a whole bunch more,

00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:02.835
but one of the ones we tried was called Basic16,

00:06:02.835 --> 00:06:05.467
and the only requirement here

00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:08.620
was that your password had
to have at least 16 characters.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.078
All right, so now we had 5,000 passwords,

00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:14.641
and so we had much more detailed information.

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:17.200
Again we see that there's only a small number

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.115
of symbols that people are actually using

00:06:19.115 --> 00:06:21.001
in their passwords.

00:06:21.001 --> 00:06:23.600
We also wanted to get an idea of how strong

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.371
the passwords were that people were creating,

00:06:26.371 --> 00:06:28.991
but as you may recall, there isn't a good measure

00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:30.745
of password strength.

00:06:30.745 --> 00:06:33.057
So what we decided to do was to see

00:06:33.057 --> 00:06:35.427
how long it would take to crack these passwords

00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:36.841
using the best cracking tools

00:06:36.841 --> 00:06:38.649
that the bad guys are using,

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.665
or that we could find information about

00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:42.202
in the research literature.

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:44.960
So to give you an idea of how bad guys

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.130
go about cracking passwords,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.081
they will steal a password file

00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:51.234
that will have all of the passwords

00:06:51.234 --> 00:06:54.123
in kind of a scrambled form, called a hash,

00:06:54.123 --> 00:06:56.685
and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess

00:06:56.685 --> 00:06:58.397
as to what a password is,

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:00.294
run it through a hashing function,

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:02.059
and see whether it matches

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:06.009
the passwords they have on
their stolen password list.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.114
So a dumb attacker will try every password in order.

00:07:09.114 --> 00:07:12.682
They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB,

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.100
and this is going to take a really long time

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.626
before they get any passwords

00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:19.323
that people are really likely to actually have.

00:07:19.323 --> 00:07:21.506
A smart attacker, on the other hand,

00:07:21.506 --> 00:07:22.892
does something much more clever.

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:24.718
They look at the passwords

00:07:24.718 --> 00:07:26.518
that are known to be popular

00:07:26.518 --> 00:07:28.245
from these stolen password sets,

00:07:28.245 --> 00:07:29.434
and they guess those first.

00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:31.568
So they're going to start by guessing "password,"

00:07:31.568 --> 00:07:34.319
and then they'll guess "I love you," and "monkey,"

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.902
and "12345678,"

00:07:36.902 --> 00:07:38.214
because these are the passwords

00:07:38.214 --> 00:07:40.119
that are most likely for people to have.

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:43.380
In fact, some of you probably have these passwords.

00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:46.489
So what we found

00:07:46.489 --> 00:07:49.895
by running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected

00:07:49.895 --> 00:07:54.001
through these tests to see how strong they were,

00:07:54.001 --> 00:07:56.753
we found that the long passwords

00:07:56.753 --> 00:07:58.033
were actually pretty strong,

00:07:58.033 --> 00:08:01.295
and the complex passwords were pretty strong too.

00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:03.737
However, when we looked at the survey data,

00:08:03.737 --> 00:08:06.761
we saw that people were really frustrated

00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:09.100
by the very complex passwords,

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.730
and the long passwords were a lot more usable,

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.055
and in some cases, they were actually

00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:15.963
even stronger than the complex passwords.

00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:17.132
So this suggests that,

00:08:17.132 --> 00:08:18.835
instead of telling people that they need

00:08:18.835 --> 00:08:20.357
to put all these symbols and numbers

00:08:20.357 --> 00:08:23.199
and crazy things into their passwords,

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:25.221
we might be better off just telling people

00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:27.873
to have long passwords.

00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:29.665
Now here's the problem, though:

00:08:29.665 --> 00:08:31.920
Some people had long passwords

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.475
that actually weren't very strong.

00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:35.472
You can make long passwords

00:08:35.472 --> 00:08:37.028
that are still the sort of thing

00:08:37.028 --> 00:08:38.770
that an attacker could easily guess.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.135
So we need to do more than
just say long passwords.

00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:44.071
There has to be some additional requirements,

00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:47.040
and some of our ongoing research is looking at

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.479
what additional requirements we should add

00:08:49.479 --> 00:08:51.583
to make for stronger passwords

00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:53.895
that also are going to be easy for people

00:08:53.895 --> 00:08:56.593
to remember and type.

00:08:56.593 --> 00:08:58.719
Another approach to getting people to have

00:08:58.719 --> 00:09:00.976
stronger passwords is to use a password meter.

00:09:00.976 --> 00:09:02.361
Here are some examples.

00:09:02.361 --> 00:09:03.762
You may have seen these on the Internet

00:09:03.762 --> 00:09:06.819
when you were creating passwords.

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:09.067
We decided to do a study to find out

00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:11.954
whether these password meters actually work.

00:09:11.954 --> 00:09:13.375
Do they actually help people

00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:14.828
have stronger passwords,

00:09:14.828 --> 00:09:16.914
and if so, which ones are better?

00:09:16.914 --> 00:09:19.421
So we tested password meters that were

00:09:19.421 --> 00:09:21.519
different sizes, shapes, colors,

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.935
different words next to them,

00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:26.210
and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.792
As you type a better password,

00:09:27.792 --> 00:09:30.331
the bunny dances faster and faster.

00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:32.860
So this was pretty fun.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.427
What we found

00:09:34.427 --> 00:09:37.999
was that password meters do work.

00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:39.800
(Laughter)

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.133
Most of the password meters were actually effective,

00:09:43.133 --> 00:09:45.654
and the dancing bunny was very effective too,

00:09:45.654 --> 00:09:48.535
but the password meters that were the most effective

00:09:48.535 --> 00:09:50.890
were the ones that made you work harder

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.870
before they gave you that thumbs up and said

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.247
you were doing a good job,

00:09:54.247 --> 00:09:55.759
and in fact we found that most

00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:58.040
of the password meters on the Internet today

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.992
are too soft.

00:09:58.992 --> 00:10:01.195
They tell you you're doing a good job too early,

00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:03.124
and if they would just wait a little bit

00:10:03.124 --> 00:10:05.173
before giving you that positive feedback,

00:10:05.173 --> 00:10:08.333
you probably would have better passwords.

00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:12.180
Now another approach to better passwords, perhaps,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.070
is to use pass phrases instead of passwords.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.488
So this was an xkcd cartoon 
from a couple of years ago,

00:10:18.488 --> 00:10:20.162
and the cartoonist suggests

00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:22.358
that we should all use pass phrases,

00:10:22.358 --> 00:10:25.528
and if you look at the second row of this cartoon,

00:10:25.528 --> 00:10:27.385
you can see the cartoonist is suggesting

00:10:27.385 --> 00:10:30.826
that the pass phrase "correct horse battery staple"

00:10:30.826 --> 00:10:33.307
would be a very strong pass phrase

00:10:33.307 --> 00:10:35.223
and something really easy to remember.

00:10:35.223 --> 00:10:38.020
He says, in fact, you've already remembered it.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.170
And so we decided to do a research study

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.762
to find out whether this was true or not.

00:10:42.762 --> 00:10:44.537
In fact, everybody who I talk to,

00:10:44.537 --> 00:10:46.579
who I mention I'm doing password research,

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:47.979
they point out this cartoon.

00:10:47.979 --> 00:10:49.553
"Oh, have you seen it? That xkcd.

00:10:49.553 --> 00:10:51.155
Correct horse battery staple."

00:10:51.155 --> 00:10:52.961
So we did the research study to see

00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:55.320
what would actually happen.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.380
So in our study, we used Mechanical Turk again,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.547
and we had the computer pick the random words

00:11:02.547 --> 00:11:03.647
in the pass phrase.

00:11:03.647 --> 00:11:04.800
Now the reason we did this

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.386
is that humans are not very good

00:11:06.386 --> 00:11:07.770
at picking random words.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.032
If we asked a human to do it,

00:11:09.032 --> 00:11:12.030
they would pick things that were not very random.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.062
So we tried a few different conditions.

00:11:14.062 --> 00:11:16.152
In one condition, the computer picked

00:11:16.152 --> 00:11:18.368
from a dictionary of the very common words

00:11:18.368 --> 00:11:19.730
in the English language,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.494
and so you'd get pass phrases like

00:11:21.494 --> 00:11:23.418
"try there three come."

00:11:23.418 --> 00:11:25.150
And we looked at that, and we said,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.200
"Well, that doesn't really seem very memorable."

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.440
So then we tried picking words

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.961
that came from specific parts of speech,

00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:35.143
so how about noun-verb-adjective-noun.

00:11:35.143 --> 00:11:37.720
That comes up with something
that's sort of sentence-like.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.790
So you can get a pass phrase like

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.098
"plan builds sure power"

00:11:41.098 --> 00:11:43.884
or "end determines red drug."

00:11:43.884 --> 00:11:46.560
And these seemed a little bit more memorable,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.382
and maybe people would like those a little bit better.

00:11:49.382 --> 00:11:51.954
We wanted to compare them with passwords,

00:11:51.954 --> 00:11:55.150
and so we had the computer
pick random passwords,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.140
and these were nice and short, but as you can see,

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.946
they don't really look very memorable.

00:11:59.946 --> 00:12:01.342
And then we decided to try something called

00:12:01.342 --> 00:12:02.988
a pronounceable password.

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:05.233
So here the computer picks random syllables

00:12:05.233 --> 00:12:06.367
and puts them together

00:12:06.367 --> 00:12:08.842
so you have something sort of pronounceable,

00:12:08.842 --> 00:12:11.444
like "tufritvi" and "vadasabi."

00:12:11.444 --> 00:12:13.591
That one kind of rolls off your tongue.

00:12:13.591 --> 00:12:15.807
So these were random passwords that were

00:12:15.807 --> 00:12:18.551
generated by our computer.

00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:21.529
So what we found in this study was that, surprisingly,

00:12:21.529 --> 00:12:25.297
pass phrases were not actually all that good.

00:12:25.297 --> 00:12:28.090
People were not really better at remembering

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.043
the pass phrases than these random passwords,

00:12:31.043 --> 00:12:33.797
and because the pass phrases are longer,

00:12:33.797 --> 00:12:35.023
they took longer to type

00:12:35.023 --> 00:12:38.033
and people made more errors while typing them in.

00:12:38.033 --> 00:12:41.260
So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.605
Sorry, all of you xkcd fans.

00:12:44.605 --> 00:12:46.497
On the other hand, we did find

00:12:46.497 --> 00:12:48.301
that pronounceable passwords

00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:49.772
worked surprisingly well,

00:12:49.772 --> 00:12:52.190
and so we actually are doing some more research

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.385
to see if we can make that
approach work even better.

00:12:55.385 --> 00:12:57.197
So one of the problems

00:12:57.197 --> 00:12:58.820
with some of the studies that we've done

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.503
is that because they're all done

00:13:00.503 --> 00:13:02.093
using Mechanical Turk,

00:13:02.093 --> 00:13:03.905
these are not people's real passwords.

00:13:03.905 --> 00:13:06.010
They're the passwords that they created

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.505
or the computer created for them for our study.

00:13:08.505 --> 00:13:10.073
And we wanted to know whether people

00:13:10.073 --> 00:13:12.385
would actually behave the same way

00:13:12.385 --> 00:13:14.612
with their real passwords.

00:13:14.612 --> 00:13:18.293
So we talked to the information
security office at Carnegie Mellon

00:13:18.293 --> 00:13:22.096
and asked them if we could
have everybody's real passwords.

00:13:22.096 --> 00:13:23.850
Not surprisingly, they were a little bit reluctant

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.400
to share them with us,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.210
but we were actually able to work out

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:28.250
a system with them

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.359
where they put all of the real passwords

00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:33.450
for 25,000 CMU students, faculty and staff,

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.898
into a locked computer in a locked room,

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:37.292
not connected to the Internet,

00:13:37.292 --> 00:13:39.140
and they ran code on it that we wrote

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.292
to analyze these passwords.

00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:42.618
They audited our code.

00:13:42.618 --> 00:13:43.930
They ran the code.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.668
And so we never actually saw

00:13:45.668 --> 00:13:48.485
anybody's password.

00:13:48.485 --> 00:13:50.000
We got some interesting results,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.696
and those of you Tepper students in the back

00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:54.571
will be very interested in this.

00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:58.302
So we found that the passwords created

00:13:58.302 --> 00:14:00.460
by people affiliated with the
school of computer science

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.784
were actually 1.8 times stronger

00:14:02.784 --> 00:14:06.522
than those affiliated with the business school.

00:14:06.522 --> 00:14:08.562
We have lots of other really interesting

00:14:08.562 --> 00:14:10.800
demographic information as well.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.646
The other interesting thing that we found

00:14:12.646 --> 00:14:15.086
is that when we compared
the Carnegie Mellon passwords

00:14:15.086 --> 00:14:17.369
to the Mechanical Turk-generated passwords,

00:14:17.369 --> 00:14:19.988
there was actually a lot of similarities,

00:14:19.988 --> 00:14:21.936
and so this helped validate our research method

00:14:21.936 --> 00:14:24.446
and show that actually, collecting passwords

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:26.254
using these Mechanical Turk studies

00:14:26.254 --> 00:14:29.042
is actually a valid way to study passwords.

00:14:29.042 --> 00:14:31.327
So that was good news.

00:14:31.327 --> 00:14:33.741
Okay, I want to close by talking about

00:14:33.741 --> 00:14:35.809
some insights I gained while on sabbatical

00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:39.010
last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.291
One of the things that I did

00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:41.815
is I made a number of quilts,

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:43.363
and I made this quilt here.

00:14:43.363 --> 00:14:45.262
It's called "Security Blanket."

00:14:45.262 --> 00:14:47.693
(Laughter)

00:14:47.693 --> 00:14:50.788
And this quilt has the 1,000

00:14:50.788 --> 00:14:53.116
most frequent passwords stolen

00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:55.687
from the RockYou website.

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.748
And the size of the passwords is proportional

00:14:57.748 --> 00:14:59.649
to how frequently they appeared

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.897
in the stolen dataset.

00:15:01.897 --> 00:15:04.529
And what I did is I created this word cloud,

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.661
and I went through all 1,000 words,

00:15:06.661 --> 00:15:08.456
and I categorized them into

00:15:08.456 --> 00:15:10.836
loose thematic categories.

00:15:10.836 --> 00:15:12.739
And it was, in some cases,

00:15:12.739 --> 00:15:14.777
it was kind of difficult to figure out

00:15:14.777 --> 00:15:16.532
what category they should be in,

00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:18.431
and then I color-coded them.

00:15:18.431 --> 00:15:21.050
So here are some examples of the difficulty.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.231
So "justin."

00:15:22.231 --> 00:15:24.060
Is that the name of the user,

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.382
their boyfriend, their son?

00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:28.270
Maybe they're a Justin Bieber fan.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.495
Or "princess."

00:15:30.495 --> 00:15:32.130
Is that a nickname?

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.725
Are they Disney princess fans?

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:37.419
Or maybe that's the name of their cat.

00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:39.074
"Iloveyou" appears many times

00:15:39.074 --> 00:15:40.619
in many different languages.

00:15:40.619 --> 00:15:44.354
There's a lot of love in these passwords.

00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:46.034
If you look carefully, you'll see there's also

00:15:46.034 --> 00:15:48.301
some profanity,

00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:50.251
but it was really interesting to me to see

00:15:50.251 --> 00:15:52.558
that there's a lot more love than hate

00:15:52.558 --> 00:15:54.850
in these passwords.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.340
And there are animals,

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.700
a lot of animals,

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.004
and "monkey" is the most common animal

00:16:00.004 --> 00:16:03.679
and the 14th most popular password overall.

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:05.910
And this was really curious to me,

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.433
and I wondered, "Why are monkeys so popular?"

00:16:08.433 --> 00:16:11.785
And so in our last password study,

00:16:11.785 --> 00:16:13.471
any time we detected somebody

00:16:13.471 --> 00:16:16.120
creating a password with the word "monkey" in it,

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.150
we asked them why they had
a monkey in their password.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.060
And what we found out --

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.163
we found 17 people so far, I think,

00:16:23.163 --> 00:16:24.446
who have the word "monkey" --

00:16:24.446 --> 00:16:26.258
We found out about a third of them said

00:16:26.258 --> 00:16:27.998
they have a pet named "monkey"

00:16:27.998 --> 00:16:30.289
or a friend whose nickname is "monkey,"

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.949
and about a third of them said

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:33.482
that they just like monkeys

00:16:33.482 --> 00:16:35.120
and monkeys are really cute.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.759
And that guy is really cute.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:42.167
So it seems that at the end of the day,

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.950
when we make passwords,

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.924
we either make something that's really easy

00:16:45.924 --> 00:16:48.933
to type, a common pattern,

00:16:48.933 --> 00:16:51.419
or things that remind us of the word password

00:16:51.419 --> 00:16:54.731
or the account that we've created the password for,

00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:57.348
or whatever.

00:16:57.348 --> 00:16:59.990
Or we think about things that make us happy,

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.294
and we create our password

00:17:01.294 --> 00:17:03.532
based on things that make us happy.

00:17:03.532 --> 00:17:06.395
And while this makes typing

00:17:06.395 --> 00:17:09.265
and remembering your password more fun,

00:17:09.265 --> 00:17:11.072
it also makes it a lot easier

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.578
to guess your password.

00:17:12.578 --> 00:17:14.326
So I know a lot of these TED Talks

00:17:14.326 --> 00:17:15.960
are inspirational

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.421
and they make you think about nice, happy things,

00:17:18.421 --> 00:17:20.318
but when you're creating your password,

00:17:20.318 --> 00:17:22.309
try to think about something else.

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:23.416
Thank you.

00:17:23.416 --> 00:17:23.969
(Applause)
