00:00:00.927 --> 00:00:03.108
I want to talk to you about one thing

00:00:03.108 --> 00:00:04.864
and just one thing only,

00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:08.620
and this has to do with when people ask me,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.867
what do you do?

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:13.767
To which I usually respond,

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:16.907
I do computer music.

00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:18.852
Now, a number of people

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.089
just stop talking to me right then and there,

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.502
and the rest who are left usually have

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:25.750
this blank look in their eye,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.919
as if to say, what does that mean?

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.137
And I feel like I'm actually depriving them

00:00:30.137 --> 00:00:33.342
of information by telling them this,

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:35.070
at which point I usually panic

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.660
and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.442
which is, I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:42.054
Which is true.

00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:44.910
That's usually followed by a second thought,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.210
which is, whatever it is that I'm doing,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.902
I love it.

00:00:49.902 --> 00:00:53.699
And today, I want to, well,

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.870
share with you something I love,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.354
and also why.

00:00:57.354 --> 00:01:01.283
And I think we'll begin with just this question:

00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:02.620
What is computer music?

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.400
And I'm going to try to do my
best to provide a definition,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.131
maybe by telling you a story

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:09.778
that goes through some of the stuff

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.704
I've been working on.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.516
And the first thing, I think, in our story

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:16.064
is going to be something called ChucK.

00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:21.437
Now, ChucK is a programming language for music,

00:01:21.437 --> 00:01:24.146
and it's open-source, it's freely available,

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:26.066
and I like to think that it crashes equally well

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.410
on all modern operating systems.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.370
And instead of telling you more about it,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.196
I'm just going to give you a demo.

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:34.352
By the way, I'm just going to nerd out

00:01:34.352 --> 00:01:35.981
for just a few minutes here,

00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:38.779
so I would say, don't freak out.

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:40.850
In fact, I would invite all of you to join me

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.034
in just geeking out.

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:45.096
If you've never written a line
of code before in your life,

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:46.282
do not worry.

00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:49.799
I'll bet you'll be able to come along on this.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.218
First thing I'm going to do is to make

00:01:51.218 --> 00:01:53.051
a sine wave oscillator,

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:56.085
and we're going to called the sine wave generator

00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:58.847
"Ge."

00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:00.937
And then we're going to connect "Ge" to the DAC.

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:02.091
Now this is kind of the abstraction

00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:04.699
for the sound output on my computer. Okay?

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:07.899
So I've connected myself into the speaker.

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.491
Next, I'm going to say my frequency

00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:11.459
is 440 hertz,

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.278
and I'm going to let time advance

00:02:15.278 --> 00:02:18.000
by two seconds through this operation.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.068
All right, so if I were to play this --

00:02:22.068 --> 00:02:24.740
(Tone) —

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.161
you would hear a sine wave
at 440 hertz for two seconds.

00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:30.187
Okay, great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this,

00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:31.931
and then just change some of these numbers,

00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:35.891
220.5, 440 I shall leave it as that,

00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:38.331
and .5 and 880.

00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:39.693
By doubling the frequency,

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:42.210
we're actually going up in successive octaves,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.547
and then we have this sequence --

00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:45.674
(Tones) — of tones.

00:02:45.674 --> 00:02:47.580
Okay, great, now I can imagine creating

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.022
all kinds of really horrible

00:02:49.022 --> 00:02:51.420
single sine wave pieces of music with this,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.332
but I'm going to do something
that computers are really good at,

00:02:54.332 --> 00:02:56.156
which is repetition.

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:57.860
I'm going to put this all in a while loop,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.156
and you actually don't need to indent,

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:01.280
but this is purely for aesthetic reasons.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.884
It's good practice.

00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:04.464
And when we do this —

00:03:04.464 --> 00:03:08.961
(Tones) —

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:10.134
that's going to go on for a while.

00:03:10.134 --> 00:03:11.628
In fact, it's probably not going to stop

00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:13.411
until this computer disintegrates.

00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:16.110
And I can't really empirically prove that to you,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.779
but I hope you'll believe me when I say that.

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.655
Next, I'm going to replace this 220

00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:24.461
by math.random2f.

00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:25.739
I'm going to generate a random number

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.879
between 30 and 1,000 and send that

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.965
to the frequency of me.

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:33.065
And I'm going to do this every half a second.

00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:36.007
(Tones)

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.668
Let's do this every 200 milliseconds.

00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:43.290
(Tones)

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.745
One hundred.

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:46.357
(Tones)

00:03:46.357 --> 00:03:47.591
All right.

00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.535
At this point, we've reached something

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:50.605
that I would like to think of as

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:54.626
the canonical computer music.

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:58.443
This is, to me, the sound that mainframes

00:03:58.443 --> 00:03:59.565
are supposed to be making

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:02.807
when they're thinking really hard.

00:04:02.807 --> 00:04:04.900
It's this sound, it's like,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.471
the square root of five million.

00:04:10.427 --> 00:04:14.211
So is this computer music?

00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:16.190
Yeah, I guess by definition,

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.395
it's kind of computer music.

00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:20.403
It's probably not the kind of music you would listen to

00:04:20.403 --> 00:04:21.891
cruising down the highway,

00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:26.907
but it's a foundation of computer-generated music,

00:04:26.907 --> 00:04:29.110
and using ChucK,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.803
we've actually been building instruments

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.699
in the Stanford Laptop Orchestra,

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.900
based right here at Stanford Center for
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.683
Now the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops,

00:04:39.683 --> 00:04:42.312
humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays.

00:04:42.312 --> 00:04:43.909
Now the reason we have these

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.379
is so that for the instruments that we create

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.603
out of the laptop, we want the sound to come

00:04:48.603 --> 00:04:51.123
out of somewhere near the instrument

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:52.491
and the performer,

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:55.193
kind of much like a traditional, acoustic instrument.

00:04:55.193 --> 00:04:57.079
Like, if I were to play a violin here,

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:59.190
the sound would naturally not come out of

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.964
the P.A. system, but from the artifact itself.

00:05:01.964 --> 00:05:05.171
So these speakers are meant to emulate that.

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.500
In fact, I'm going to show you

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.243
how we actually built them.

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:11.307
The first step is to go to IKEA

00:05:11.307 --> 00:05:12.687
and buy a salad bowl.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:15.917
This is an 11-inch Blanda Matt.

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:17.415
That's the actual name,

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:18.837
and I actually use one of these

00:05:18.837 --> 00:05:21.065
to make salad at home as well, I kid you not.

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:24.236
And the first step is you turn it upside down,

00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:26.711
and then you drill holes in them,

00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:29.220
six holes per hemi,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.934
and then make a base plate,

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:33.614
put car speaker drivers in them

00:05:33.614 --> 00:05:36.205
along with amplifiers in the enclosure,

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:37.559
and you put that all together and you have

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:39.333
these hemispherical speaker arrays.

00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:40.896
Add people, add laptops,

00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:43.584
you have a laptop orchestra.

00:05:43.584 --> 00:05:47.114
And what might a laptop orchestra sound like?

00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:49.033
Well, let me give you a demonstration

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:52.268
of about 200 instruments we've created so far

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.511
for the Laptop Orchestra.

00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.938
And what I'm going to do is
actually come over to this thing.

00:05:57.938 --> 00:06:00.143
This thing I have in front of me

00:06:00.143 --> 00:06:03.355
actually used to be a commodity gaming controller

00:06:03.355 --> 00:06:05.145
called a Gametrak.

00:06:05.145 --> 00:06:07.021
This thing actually has a glove
you can put on your hands.

00:06:07.021 --> 00:06:08.581
It's tethered to the base,

00:06:08.581 --> 00:06:11.110
and this will track the position of your hands

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.163
in real time.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:15.537
It was originally designed as a golfing controller

00:06:15.537 --> 00:06:17.453
to detect the motion of your swing.

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:19.984
That turned out to be a rather large

00:06:19.984 --> 00:06:21.688
commercial non-success,

00:06:21.688 --> 00:06:25.442
at which point they slashed prices to 10 dollars,

00:06:25.442 --> 00:06:27.450
at which point computer music researchers

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.508
said, "This is awesome!

00:06:29.508 --> 00:06:32.257
We can prototype instruments out of this."

00:06:32.257 --> 00:06:35.201
So let me show you one instrument we've created,

00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:37.113
one of many, and this instrument

00:06:37.113 --> 00:06:38.682
is called "Twilight,"

00:06:38.682 --> 00:06:41.368
and it's meant to go with this metaphor

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:44.401
of pulling a sound out of the ground.

00:06:44.401 --> 00:06:47.752
So let me see if this will work.

00:06:47.752 --> 00:06:54.188
(Music)

00:06:56.968 --> 00:06:58.791
And put it back.

00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:02.886
And then if you go to the left,

00:07:02.886 --> 00:07:05.381
right,

00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:13.231
it sounds like an elephant in pain.

00:07:13.231 --> 00:07:16.259
This is a slightly metallic sound.

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:19.613
Turn it just a bit.

00:07:19.613 --> 00:07:22.569
(Music)

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:28.785
It's like a hovering car.

00:07:32.406 --> 00:07:33.799
Okay.

00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:37.965
This third one is a ratchet-like interaction, so

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.911
let me turn it up.

00:07:44.915 --> 00:07:49.710
(Music)

00:07:50.068 --> 00:07:51.948
So it's a slightly different interaction.

00:07:51.948 --> 00:07:54.902
The fourth one is a drone.

00:07:55.583 --> 00:08:00.760
(Music)

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:11.319
And finally, let's see,

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:13.130
this is a totally different interaction,

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.940
and I think you have to imagine that there's

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.872
this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage,

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:20.315
and I'm going to bang it.

00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:24.902
(Drum)

00:08:24.902 --> 00:08:27.689
(Laughter)

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:30.685
So there we go, so that's one of many instruments

00:08:30.685 --> 00:08:32.455
in the Laptop Orchestra.

00:08:32.455 --> 00:08:36.009
(Applause)

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:38.290
Thank you.

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.396
And when you put that together,

00:08:40.396 --> 00:08:44.464
you get something that sounds like this.

00:08:44.464 --> 00:08:51.123
(Music)

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.820
Okay, and so, I think from the experience

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.343
of building a lot of instruments
for the Laptop Orchestra,

00:09:38.343 --> 00:09:40.847
and I think from the curiosity of wondering,

00:09:40.847 --> 00:09:42.350
what if we took these

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.942
hopefully expressive instruments

00:09:43.942 --> 00:09:46.575
and we brought it to a lot of people,

00:09:46.575 --> 00:09:48.982
plus then a healthy bout of insanity —

00:09:48.982 --> 00:09:50.471
put those three things together —

00:09:50.471 --> 00:09:53.987
led to me actually co-founding a startup company

00:09:53.987 --> 00:09:56.446
in 2008 called Smule.

00:09:56.446 --> 00:09:58.366
Now Smule's mission is to create

00:09:58.366 --> 00:10:02.223
expressive, mobile music things,

00:10:02.223 --> 00:10:06.985
and one of the first musical instruments

00:10:06.985 --> 00:10:08.845
we created is called Ocarina.

00:10:08.845 --> 00:10:11.610
And I'm going to just demo this for you real quick.

00:10:15.234 --> 00:10:17.650
So Ocarina —

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.248
(Music) —

00:10:21.248 --> 00:10:24.371
is based on this ancient flute-like instrument

00:10:24.371 --> 00:10:25.780
called the ocarina,

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.163
and this one is the four-hole
English pendant configuration,

00:10:29.163 --> 00:10:32.566
and you're literally blowing into the microphone

00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:35.492
to make the sound.

00:10:35.492 --> 00:10:37.125
And there's actually a little ChucK script

00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:38.293
running in here that's detecting

00:10:38.293 --> 00:10:39.775
the strength of your blowing

00:10:39.775 --> 00:10:41.893
and also synthesizing the sound.

00:10:41.893 --> 00:10:45.478
(Music)

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.808
And vibrato is mapped to the accelerometer,

00:10:48.808 --> 00:10:50.461
so you can get —

00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:53.790
(Music)

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.500
All right. So let me play a little ditty for you,

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:01.349
a little Bach.

00:11:01.349 --> 00:11:03.941
And here, you'll hear a little
accompaniment with the melody.

00:11:03.941 --> 00:11:06.509
The accompaniment actually follows the melody,

00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:10.290
not the other way around.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.625
(Music)

00:11:23.132 --> 00:11:24.789
And this was designed

00:11:24.789 --> 00:11:26.065
to let you take your time

00:11:26.065 --> 00:11:29.270
and figure out where your expressive space is,

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.077
and you can just hang out here

00:11:31.077 --> 00:11:34.139
for a while, for a really
dramatic effect, if you want,

00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:37.205
and whenever you're ready —

00:11:37.205 --> 00:11:41.857
(Music)

00:11:52.981 --> 00:11:54.089
And on these longer notes,

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:56.190
I'm going to use more vibrato

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.082
towards the end of the notes

00:11:57.082 --> 00:12:00.134
to give it a little bit more of an expressive quality.

00:12:00.134 --> 00:12:03.750
(Music)

00:12:07.473 --> 00:12:11.160
Huh, that's a nice chord to end this excerpt on.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.581
(Applause)

00:12:14.581 --> 00:12:17.841
Thank you.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.746
So I think a good question to ask about Ocarina is,

00:12:23.746 --> 00:12:28.493
is this a toy or it an instrument? Maybe it's both,

00:12:28.493 --> 00:12:30.502
but for me, I think the more important question is,

00:12:30.502 --> 00:12:32.043
is it expressive?

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:34.117
And at the same time, I think

00:12:34.117 --> 00:12:35.421
creating these types of instruments

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:38.783
asks a question about the role of technology,

00:12:38.783 --> 00:12:40.477
and its place for how we make music.

00:12:40.477 --> 00:12:42.214
Apparently, for example,

00:12:42.214 --> 00:12:44.120
not that long ago, like only a hundred years ago —

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.640
that's not that long in the course of human history —

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.621
families back then

00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:49.509
used to make music together

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:52.557
as a common form of entertainment.

00:12:52.557 --> 00:12:53.802
I don't think that's really happening

00:12:53.802 --> 00:12:55.337
that much anymore.

00:12:55.337 --> 00:12:57.007
You know, this is before radio, before recording.

00:12:57.007 --> 00:12:59.214
In the last hundred years, with all this technology,

00:12:59.214 --> 00:13:01.388
we now have more access to music

00:13:01.388 --> 00:13:03.021
as listeners and consumers,

00:13:03.021 --> 00:13:06.084
but somehow, I think we're making less music

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:07.770
than ever before.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.401
I'm not sure why that would be.

00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:12.050
Maybe it's because it's too easy just to hit play.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.509
And while listening to music is wonderful,

00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:17.918
there's a special joy to making music

00:13:17.918 --> 00:13:19.573
that's all its own.

00:13:19.573 --> 00:13:20.836
And I think that's one part

00:13:20.836 --> 00:13:22.926
of the goal of why I do what I do

00:13:22.926 --> 00:13:27.682
is kind of to take us back to the past a little bit. Right?

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:29.462
Now, if that's one goal, the other goal

00:13:29.462 --> 00:13:30.892
is to look to the future and think about

00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:33.229
what kind of new musical things can we make

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:35.822
that we don't perhaps yet have names for

00:13:35.822 --> 00:13:38.685
that's enabled by technology, but ultimately

00:13:38.685 --> 00:13:41.126
might change the way that humans make music.

00:13:41.126 --> 00:13:43.498
And I'll just give you one example here,

00:13:43.498 --> 00:13:49.723
and this is Ocarina's other feature.

00:13:49.723 --> 00:13:51.910
This is a globe,

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.683
and here you're actually listening

00:13:54.683 --> 00:13:56.735
to other users of Ocarina

00:13:56.735 --> 00:14:00.715
blow into their iPhones to play something.

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:05.568
This is "G.I.R." from Texas,

00:14:05.568 --> 00:14:11.501
"R.I.K." I don't know why it's these
three-letter names today, Los Angeles.

00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:16.519
They're all playing pretty,

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:19.879
somewhat minimal music here.

00:14:19.879 --> 00:14:25.327
(Music)

00:14:25.327 --> 00:14:27.933
And the idea with this is that, well,

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:31.850
technology should not be foregrounded here,

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.933
and — (Laughter) —

00:14:33.933 --> 00:14:36.646
we've actually opened this up.

00:14:36.646 --> 00:14:38.153
The first thought is that, hey, you know

00:14:38.153 --> 00:14:41.343
there's somebody somewhere out there

00:14:41.343 --> 00:14:42.613
playing some music,

00:14:42.613 --> 00:14:44.393
and this is a small but I think important

00:14:44.393 --> 00:14:45.613
human connection to make

00:14:45.613 --> 00:14:48.611
that perhaps the technology affords.

00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:51.435
As a final example,

00:14:51.435 --> 00:14:52.790
and perhaps my favorite example,

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.941
is that in the wake of the 2011 earthquake

00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:58.427
and tsunami disaster in Japan,

00:14:58.427 --> 00:15:01.270
a woman reached out in one of our singing apps

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.157
to try to get people to join in to sing with her

00:15:04.157 --> 00:15:05.762
on a version of "Lean on Me."

00:15:05.762 --> 00:15:08.810
Now, in these apps, there's this thing that allows

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.511
any user to add their voice

00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:13.309
to an existing performance by any other user

00:15:13.309 --> 00:15:14.363
or group of users,

00:15:14.363 --> 00:15:16.388
so in some sense, she's created this kind of

00:15:16.388 --> 00:15:19.772
global ad hoc corral of strangers,

00:15:19.772 --> 00:15:21.980
and within weeks, thousands of people

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.612
joined in on this,

00:15:23.612 --> 00:15:25.991
and you can kind of see people
coming from all around the world

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:28.272
and all these lines converging on the origin

00:15:28.272 --> 00:15:30.620
where the first rendition of the song was sung,

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.254
and that's in Tokyo.

00:15:32.254 --> 00:15:35.686
And this is what it sounds like 
when there's 1,000 people.

00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:37.663
This is 1,000 voices.

Is this computer music?

00:16:25.296 --> 00:16:28.884
(Applause)

00:16:30.728 --> 00:16:32.696
Was that computer music?

00:16:32.696 --> 00:16:34.743
Yeah, I guess so; it's something that you really

00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:37.028
couldn't have done without computers.

00:16:37.028 --> 00:16:41.264
But at the same time, it's also just human,

00:16:41.264 --> 00:16:44.353
and I think what I've essentially answered so far

00:16:44.353 --> 00:16:47.744
is maybe why I do the stuff that I do,

00:16:47.744 --> 00:16:50.136
and let's just finally return to the first question:

00:16:50.136 --> 00:16:52.248
What is computer music?

00:16:52.248 --> 00:16:54.552
And I think that the catch here is that,

00:16:54.552 --> 00:16:55.808
at least to me, computer music

00:16:55.808 --> 00:16:57.656
isn't really about computers.

00:16:57.656 --> 00:16:59.182
It is about people.

00:16:59.182 --> 00:17:00.816
It's about how we can use technology

00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:02.862
to change the way we think

00:17:02.862 --> 00:17:04.306
and do and make music,

00:17:04.306 --> 00:17:07.992
and maybe even add to how we can

00:17:07.992 --> 00:17:10.502
connect with each other through music.

00:17:10.502 --> 00:17:12.655
And with that, I want to say,

00:17:12.655 --> 00:17:15.752
this is computer music, and thank you for listening.

00:17:15.752 --> 00:17:19.752
(Applause)
