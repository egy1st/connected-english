WEBVTT

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.046
The human voice:

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.634
It's the instrument we all play.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.069
It's the most powerful sound
in the world, probably.

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:11.916
It's the only one that can start a war
or say "I love you."

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.798
And yet many people have the experience

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:16.186
that when they speak, people
don't listen to them.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.322
And why is that?

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:21.112
How can we speak powerfully
to make change in the world?

00:00:21.485 --> 00:00:22.797
What I'd like to suggest,

00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:25.666
there are a number of habits
that we need to move away from.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.420
I've assembled for your pleasure here
seven deadly sins of speaking.

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:31.852
I'm not pretending
this is an exhaustive list,

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:37.108
but these seven, I think, are pretty large
habits that we can all fall into.

00:00:37.132 --> 00:00:39.139
First, gossip.

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.097
Speaking ill of somebody
who's not present.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.796
Not a nice habit,
and we know perfectly well

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.700
the person gossiping, five minutes later,
will be gossiping about us.

00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:51.491
Second, judging.

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.899
We know people who are like this
in conversation,

00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:55.855
and it's very hard to listen to somebody

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.005
if you know that you're being judged
and found wanting at the same time.

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:01.905
Third, negativity.

00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:03.735
You can fall into this.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:06.796
My mother, in the last years of her life,
became very negative,

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.142
and it's hard to listen.

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.899
I remember one day, I said to her,
"It's October 1 today,"

00:01:10.923 --> 00:01:13.016
and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?"

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.238
(Laughter)

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.611
It's hard to listen
when somebody's that negative.

00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:18.907
(Laughter)

00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:21.451
And another form
of negativity, complaining.

00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:25.518
Well, this is the national art of the U.K.

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:26.953
It's our national sport.

00:01:26.977 --> 00:01:30.411
We complain about the weather, sport,
about politics, about everything,

00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:32.531
but actually, complaining is viral misery.

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:35.187
It's not spreading sunshine
and lightness in the world.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:38.024
Excuses.

00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:39.372
We've all met this guy.

00:01:39.396 --> 00:01:40.972
Maybe we've all been this guy.

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:43.466
Some people have a blamethrower.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.694
They just pass it on to everybody else

00:01:45.718 --> 00:01:48.022
and don't take responsibility
for their actions,

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:50.958
and again, hard to listen
to somebody who is being like that.

00:01:50.982 --> 00:01:52.780
Penultimate, the sixth of the seven,

00:01:52.804 --> 00:01:56.186
embroidery, exaggeration.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.614
It demeans our language,
actually, sometimes.

00:01:58.638 --> 00:02:01.906
For example, if I see something
that really is awesome,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.196
what do I call it?

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.816
(Laughter)

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.276
And then, of course,
this exaggeration becomes lying,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.299
and we don't want to listen
to people we know are lying to us.

00:02:12.323 --> 00:02:14.563
And finally, dogmatism.

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:19.299
The confusion of facts with opinions.

00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:21.238
When those two things get conflated,

00:02:21.262 --> 00:02:22.739
you're listening into the wind.

00:02:22.763 --> 00:02:26.430
You know, somebody is bombarding you
with their opinions as if they were true.

00:02:26.454 --> 00:02:28.523
It's difficult to listen to that.

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:31.564
So here they are, seven deadly
sins of speaking.

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:33.997
These are things I think we need to avoid.

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.866
But is there a positive
way to think about this?

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.149
Yes, there is.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:43.950
I'd like to suggest that there are four
really powerful cornerstones, foundations,

00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:46.396
that we can stand on if we want our speech

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.631
to be powerful and to make
change in the world.

00:02:50.288 --> 00:02:52.499
Fortunately, these things spell a word.

00:02:52.523 --> 00:02:55.595
The word is "hail," and it has
a great definition as well.

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.263
I'm not talking about the stuff
that falls from the sky

00:02:58.287 --> 00:02:59.551
and hits you on the head.

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:01.195
I'm talking about this definition,

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.016
to greet or acclaim enthusiastically,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.283
which is how I think
our words will be received

00:03:05.307 --> 00:03:06.879
if we stand on these four things.

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:08.401
So what do they stand for?

00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:09.801
See if you can guess.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.259
The H, honesty, of course,

00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:16.230
being true in what you say,
being straight and clear.

00:03:16.254 --> 00:03:20.271
The A is authenticity,
just being yourself.

00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:23.481
A friend of mine described it as
standing in your own truth,

00:03:23.505 --> 00:03:25.419
which I think is a lovely way to put it.

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:28.055
The I is integrity, being your word,

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.843
actually doing what you say,

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:31.697
and being somebody people can trust.

00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:34.355
And the L is love.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.227
I don't mean romantic love,

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:40.636
but I do mean wishing people
well, for two reasons.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.050
First of all, I think absolute honesty
may not be what we want.

00:03:44.074 --> 00:03:46.639
I mean, my goodness,
you look ugly this morning.

00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:49.997
Perhaps that's not necessary.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.355
Tempered with love, of course,
honesty is a great thing.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.450
But also, if you're really
wishing somebody well,

00:03:56.474 --> 00:03:59.087
it's very hard to judge
them at the same time.

00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:02.673
I'm not even sure you can do
those two things simultaneously.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.886
So hail.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.643
Also, now that's what you say,

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:08.911
and it's like the old song,
it is what you say,

00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:10.614
it's also the way that you say it.

00:04:10.638 --> 00:04:12.386
You have an amazing toolbox.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.246
This instrument is incredible,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.786
and yet this is a toolbox
that very few people have ever opened.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.407
I'd like to have a little rummage
in there with you now

00:04:20.431 --> 00:04:21.831
and just pull a few tools out

00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:24.094
that you might like to take
away and play with,

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:26.418
which will increase
the power of your speaking.

00:04:26.442 --> 00:04:27.962
Register, for example.

00:04:27.986 --> 00:04:32.156
Now, falsetto register may not
be very useful most of the time,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.210
but there's a register in between.

00:04:34.234 --> 00:04:36.395
I'm not going to get very
technical about this

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.181
for any of you who are voice coaches.

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:39.918
You can locate your voice, however.

00:04:39.942 --> 00:04:42.800
So if I talk up here in my nose,
you can hear the difference.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.308
If I go down here in my throat,

00:04:44.332 --> 00:04:46.961
which is where most of us
speak from most of the time.

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:48.618
But if you want weight,

00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:51.096
you need to go down here to the chest.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.706
You hear the difference?

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.746
We vote for politicians
with lower voices, it's true,

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.714
because we associate depth with power

00:04:59.738 --> 00:05:01.500
and with authority.

00:05:02.445 --> 00:05:03.812
That's register.

00:05:04.134 --> 00:05:05.477
Then we have timbre.

00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:07.246
It's the way your voice feels.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.602
Again, the research shows

00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:12.400
that we prefer voices
which are rich, smooth, warm,

00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:13.910
like hot chocolate.

00:05:14.635 --> 00:05:17.899
Well if that's not you,
that's not the end of the world,

00:05:17.923 --> 00:05:19.341
because you can train.

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:20.585
Go and get a voice coach.

00:05:20.609 --> 00:05:22.467
And there are amazing things you can do

00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:24.897
with breathing, with posture,
and with exercises

00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:27.411
to improve the timbre of your voice.

00:05:27.435 --> 00:05:29.203
Then prosody. I love prosody.

00:05:29.227 --> 00:05:31.379
This is the sing-song, the meta-language

00:05:31.403 --> 00:05:33.453
that we use in order to impart meaning.

00:05:33.477 --> 00:05:36.291
It's root one for meaning in conversation.

00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:40.371
People who speak all on one note
are really quite hard to listen to

00:05:40.395 --> 00:05:42.587
if they don't have any prosody at all.

00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:45.562
That's where the word
"monotonic" comes from,

00:05:45.586 --> 00:05:47.523
or monotonous, monotone.

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:51.579
Also, we have repetitive
prosody now coming in,

00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:54.299
where every sentence ends
as if it were a question

00:05:54.323 --> 00:05:56.800
when it's actually not
a question, it's a statement?

00:05:56.824 --> 00:05:59.130
(Laughter)

00:05:59.154 --> 00:06:00.716
And if you repeat that one,

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.084
it's actually restricting your ability
to communicate through prosody,

00:06:04.108 --> 00:06:05.970
which I think is a shame,

00:06:05.994 --> 00:06:07.979
so let's try and break that habit.

00:06:09.315 --> 00:06:10.394
Pace.

00:06:10.418 --> 00:06:13.179
I can get very excited by saying
something really quickly,

00:06:13.203 --> 00:06:16.555
or I can slow right down to emphasize,

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:20.195
and at the end of that, of course,
is our old friend silence.

00:06:22.555 --> 00:06:25.695
There's nothing wrong with a bit
of silence in a talk, is there?

00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:29.000
We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs.

00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:31.063
It can be very powerful.

00:06:31.823 --> 00:06:34.127
Of course, pitch often
goes along with pace

00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:36.771
to indicate arousal, but you
can do it just with pitch.

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:38.359
Where did you leave my keys?

00:06:38.383 --> 00:06:40.463
(Higher pitch) Where did you
leave my keys?

00:06:40.487 --> 00:06:44.132
So, slightly different meaning
in those two deliveries.

00:06:44.156 --> 00:06:46.378
And finally, volume.

00:06:46.402 --> 00:06:49.779
(Loud) I can get really excited
by using volume.

00:06:49.803 --> 00:06:51.956
Sorry about that, if I startled anybody.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.503
Or, I can have you really pay attention
by getting very quiet.

00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:58.503
Some people broadcast the whole time.

00:06:58.527 --> 00:06:59.876
Try not to do that.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.728
That's called sodcasting,

00:07:01.752 --> 00:07:03.421
(Laughter)

00:07:03.445 --> 00:07:07.989
Imposing your sound on people around you
carelessly and inconsiderately.

00:07:08.013 --> 00:07:09.091
Not nice.

00:07:09.115 --> 00:07:11.647
Of course, where this all comes
into play most of all

00:07:11.671 --> 00:07:14.175
is when you've got something
really important to do.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.627
It might be standing on a stage like this
and giving a talk to people.

00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:19.515
It might be proposing marriage,

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.669
asking for a raise, a wedding speech.

00:07:22.693 --> 00:07:24.675
Whatever it is, if it's really important,

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:28.448
you owe it to yourself
to look at this toolbox

00:07:28.472 --> 00:07:30.485
and the engine that it's going to work on,

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:33.580
and no engine works well
without being warmed up.

00:07:33.604 --> 00:07:35.073
Warm up your voice.

00:07:35.482 --> 00:07:37.533
Actually, let me show you how to do that.

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:40.512
Would you all like to stand
up for a moment?

00:07:40.536 --> 00:07:41.667
I'm going to show you

00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:46.901
the six vocal warm-up exercises
that I do before every talk I ever do.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.835
Any time you're going to talk
to anybody important, do these.

00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:52.638
First, arms up, deep breath in,

00:07:52.662 --> 00:07:55.740
and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that.

00:07:55.764 --> 00:07:57.368
One more time.

00:07:57.392 --> 00:08:00.366
Ahhhh, very good.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.108
Now we're going to warm up our lips,

00:08:02.132 --> 00:08:04.460
and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba,

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.412
Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good.

00:08:07.436 --> 00:08:10.852
And now, brrrrrrrrrr,

00:08:10.876 --> 00:08:12.402
just like when you were a kid.

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:14.829
Brrrr. Now your lips
should be coming alive.

00:08:14.853 --> 00:08:16.504
We're going to do the tongue next

00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:20.826
with exaggerated la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.041
Beautiful. You're getting
really good at this.

00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:25.931
And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr.

00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:28.147
That's like champagne for the tongue.

00:08:28.171 --> 00:08:30.467
Finally, and if I can only do one,

00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:32.274
the pros call this the siren.

00:08:32.298 --> 00:08:34.918
It's really good. It starts
with "we" and goes to "aw."

00:08:34.942 --> 00:08:36.562
The "we" is high, the "aw" is low.

00:08:36.586 --> 00:08:42.682
So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.

00:08:42.706 --> 00:08:44.945
Fantastic. Give yourselves
a round of applause.

00:08:44.969 --> 00:08:46.214
Take a seat, thank you.

00:08:46.238 --> 00:08:47.688
(Applause)

00:08:47.712 --> 00:08:50.312
Next time you speak, do those in advance.

00:08:50.336 --> 00:08:52.952
Now let me just put this
in context to close.

00:08:52.976 --> 00:08:55.248
This is a serious point here.

00:08:55.272 --> 00:08:57.079
This is where we are now, right?

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.744
We speak not very well

00:08:58.768 --> 00:09:00.612
to people who simply aren't listening

00:09:00.636 --> 00:09:03.531
in an environment that's all
about noise and bad acoustics.

00:09:03.555 --> 00:09:06.774
I have talked about that on this stage
in different phases.

00:09:06.798 --> 00:09:08.408
What would the world be like

00:09:08.432 --> 00:09:10.128
if we were speaking powerfully

00:09:10.152 --> 00:09:12.184
to people who were listening consciously

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:15.578
in environments which were
actually fit for purpose?

00:09:15.602 --> 00:09:18.561
Or to make that a bit larger,

00:09:18.585 --> 00:09:19.919
what would the world be like

00:09:19.943 --> 00:09:22.286
if we were creating sound consciously

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.319
and consuming sound consciously

00:09:24.343 --> 00:09:26.046
and designing all our environments

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.523
consciously for sound?

00:09:27.547 --> 00:09:30.647
That would be a world
that does sound beautiful,

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:34.558
and one where understanding
would be the norm,

00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:37.231
and that is an idea worth spreading.

00:09:37.255 --> 00:09:38.387
Thank you.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.933
(Applause)
