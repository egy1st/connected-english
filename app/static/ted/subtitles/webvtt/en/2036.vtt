00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:04.045
I've been thinking a lot about the world recently

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:07.732
and how it's changed over the last 20, 30, 40 years.

00:00:07.732 --> 00:00:10.151
Twenty or 30 years ago,

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:12.681
if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:14.650
in a remote village in East Asia,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.020
it would have been a tragedy for the chicken

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.217
and its closest relatives,

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.425
but I don't think there was much possibility

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:23.100
of us fearing a global pandemic

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.093
and the deaths of millions.

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:27.821
Twenty or 30 years ago, if a bank in North America

00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:29.966
lent too much money to some people

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.987
who couldn't afford to pay it back

00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:33.719
and the bank went bust,

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.736
that was bad for the lender

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:36.368
and bad for the borrower,

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:38.231
but we didn't imagine it would bring

00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:40.446
the global economic system to its knees

00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:43.248
for nearly a decade.

00:00:43.248 --> 00:00:44.834
This is globalization.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:47.320
This is the miracle that has enabled us

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.414
to transship our bodies and our minds

00:00:50.414 --> 00:00:52.776
and our words and our pictures and our ideas

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:55.961
and our teaching and our learning around the planet

00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:58.969
ever faster and ever cheaper.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.457
It's brought a lot of bad stuff,

00:01:00.457 --> 00:01:02.101
like the stuff that I just described,

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:04.703
but it's also brought a lot of good stuff.

00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:06.293
A lot of us are not aware

00:01:06.293 --> 00:01:10.270
of the extraordinary successes of
the Millennium Development Goals,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.000
several of which have achieved their targets

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.687
long before the due date.

00:01:13.687 --> 00:01:16.702
That proves that this species of humanity

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.706
is capable of achieving extraordinary progress

00:01:19.706 --> 00:01:24.156
if it really acts together and it really tries hard.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:26.473
But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days,

00:01:26.473 --> 00:01:29.371
I sort of feel that globalization

00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:31.214
has taken us by surprise,

00:01:31.214 --> 00:01:33.994
and we've been slow to respond to it.

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:36.225
If you look at the downside of globalization,

00:01:36.225 --> 00:01:39.177
it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming.

00:01:39.177 --> 00:01:41.286
All of the grand challenges that we face today,

00:01:41.286 --> 00:01:44.443
like climate change and human rights

00:01:44.443 --> 00:01:48.741
and demographics and terrorism and pandemics

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.384
and narco-trafficking and human slavery

00:01:51.384 --> 00:01:54.104
and species loss, I could go on,

00:01:54.104 --> 00:01:56.060
we're not making an awful lot of progress

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.442
against an awful lot of those challenges.

00:01:58.442 --> 00:02:00.305
So in a nutshell, that's the challenge

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:01.744
that we all face today

00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:04.242
at this interesting point in history.

00:02:04.242 --> 00:02:06.144
That's clearly what we've got to do next.

00:02:06.144 --> 00:02:09.190
We've somehow got to get our act together

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.068
and we've got to figure out how to globalize

00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:13.003
the solutions better

00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:15.547
so that we don't simply become a species

00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:20.463
which is the victim of the globalization of problems.

00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:24.110
Why are we so slow at achieving these advances?

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.267
What's the reason for it?

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:28.211
Well, there are, of course, a number of reasons,

00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:30.722
but perhaps the primary reason

00:02:30.722 --> 00:02:34.176
is because we're still organized as a species

00:02:34.176 --> 00:02:35.778
in the same way that we were organized

00:02:35.778 --> 00:02:38.450
200 or 300 years ago.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.138
There's one superpower left on the planet

00:02:40.138 --> 00:02:42.210
and that is the seven billion people,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.600
the seven billion of us who cause all these problems,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.483
the same seven billion, by the way,

00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:48.323
who will resolve them all.

00:02:48.323 --> 00:02:50.762
But how are those seven billion organized?

00:02:50.762 --> 00:02:54.452
They're still organized in 200 or so nation-states,

00:02:54.452 --> 00:02:56.949
and the nations have governments

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.764
that make rules

00:02:58.764 --> 00:03:01.696
and cause us to behave in certain ways.

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:03.586
And that's a pretty efficient system,

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:06.567
but the problem is that the
way that those laws are made

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:09.132
and the way those governments think

00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:11.618
is absolutely wrong for the
solution of global problems,

00:03:11.618 --> 00:03:14.229
because it all looks inwards.

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:15.818
The politicians that we elect

00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:18.210
and the politicians we don't elect, on the whole,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.709
have minds that microscope.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.409
They don't have minds that telescope.

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.876
They look in. They pretend, they behave,

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:30.270
as if they believed that every country was an island

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.251
that existed quite happily, independently

00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:33.726
of all the others

00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:35.543
on its own little planet

00:03:35.543 --> 00:03:37.495
in its own little solar system.

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:39.298
This is the problem:

00:03:39.298 --> 00:03:41.416
countries competing against each other,

00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:43.218
countries fighting against each other.

00:03:43.218 --> 00:03:44.949
This week, as any week you care to look at,

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:48.382
you'll find people actually trying to kill
each other from country to country,

00:03:48.382 --> 00:03:50.203
but even when that's not going on,

00:03:50.203 --> 00:03:52.138
there's competition between countries,

00:03:52.138 --> 00:03:54.750
each one trying to shaft the next.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.829
This is clearly not a good arrangement.

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.790
We clearly need to change it.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.768
We clearly need to find ways

00:04:00.768 --> 00:04:03.413
of encouraging countries to start working together

00:04:03.413 --> 00:04:05.024
a little bit better.

00:04:05.024 --> 00:04:07.294
And why won't they do that?

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:11.422
Why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards?

00:04:11.422 --> 00:04:13.138
Well, the first and most obvious reason

00:04:13.138 --> 00:04:15.051
is because that's what we ask them to do.

00:04:15.051 --> 00:04:16.735
That's what we tell them to do.

00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:18.155
When we elect governments

00:04:18.155 --> 00:04:20.686
or when we tolerate unelected governments,

00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:23.162
we're effectively telling them that what we want

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.845
is for them to deliver us in our country

00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:27.578
a certain number of things.

00:04:27.578 --> 00:04:30.533
We want them to deliver prosperity,

00:04:30.533 --> 00:04:35.299
growth, competitiveness, transparency, justice

00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:36.974
and all of those things.

00:04:36.974 --> 00:04:39.244
So unless we start asking our governments

00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:41.525
to think outside a little bit,

00:04:41.525 --> 00:04:43.977
to consider the global problems that will finish us all

00:04:43.977 --> 00:04:45.936
if we don't start considering them,

00:04:45.936 --> 00:04:48.254
then we can hardly blame them

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:50.969
if what they carry on doing is looking inwards,

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:52.781
if they still have minds that microscope

00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:54.707
rather than minds that telescope.

00:04:54.707 --> 00:04:57.645
That's the first reason why
things tend not to change.

00:04:57.645 --> 00:05:00.899
The second reason is that these governments,

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:02.725
just like all the rest of us,

00:05:02.725 --> 00:05:05.350
are cultural psychopaths.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.657
I don't mean to be rude,

00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:08.064
but you know what a psychopath is.

00:05:08.064 --> 00:05:09.792
A psychopath is a person who,

00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:11.329
unfortunately for him or her,

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:13.368
lacks the ability to really empathize

00:05:13.368 --> 00:05:15.181
with other human beings.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:16.320
When they look around,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.982
they don't see other human beings

00:05:17.982 --> 00:05:21.096
with deep, rich, three-dimensional personal lives

00:05:21.096 --> 00:05:22.224
and aims and ambitions.

00:05:22.224 --> 00:05:25.221
What they see is cardboard cutouts,

00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:27.794
and it's very sad and it's very lonely,

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:30.532
and it's very rare, fortunately.

00:05:30.532 --> 00:05:33.687
But actually, aren't most of us

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:35.926
not really so very good at empathy?

00:05:35.926 --> 00:05:37.147
Oh sure, we're very good at empathy

00:05:37.147 --> 00:05:38.900
when it's a question of dealing with people

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.327
who kind of look like us

00:05:40.327 --> 00:05:42.809
and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.491
and wear like us,

00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:46.512
but when it comes to people who don't do that,

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:47.929
who don't quite dress like us

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:49.776
and don't quite pray like us

00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:52.181
and don't quite talk like us,

00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:54.060
do we not also have a tendency to see them

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.486
ever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too?

00:05:57.486 --> 00:05:59.194
And this is a question we need to ask ourselves.

00:05:59.194 --> 00:06:01.680
I think constantly we have to monitor it.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.774
Are we and our politicians to a degree

00:06:04.774 --> 00:06:07.160
cultural psychopaths?

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.808
The third reason is hardly worth mentioning

00:06:08.808 --> 00:06:10.259
because it's so silly,

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.199
but there's a belief amongst governments

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:13.713
that the domestic agenda

00:06:13.713 --> 00:06:15.220
and the international agenda

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.920
are incompatible and always will be.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.830
This is just nonsense.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.308
In my day job, I'm a policy adviser.

00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:23.767
I've spent the last 15 years or so

00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:25.577
advising governments around the world,

00:06:25.577 --> 00:06:28.631
and in all of that time I have never once seen

00:06:28.631 --> 00:06:30.995
a single domestic policy issue

00:06:30.995 --> 00:06:33.744
that could not be more imaginatively,

00:06:33.744 --> 00:06:36.128
effectively and rapidly resolved

00:06:36.128 --> 00:06:38.732
than by treating it as an international problem,

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.523
looking at the international context,

00:06:40.523 --> 00:06:42.318
comparing what others have done,

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:45.277
bringing in others, working externally

00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:48.644
instead of working internally.

00:06:48.644 --> 00:06:51.866
And so you may say, well, given all of that,

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:53.535
why then doesn't it work?

00:06:53.535 --> 00:06:55.916
Why can we not make our politicians change?

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.238
Why can't we demand them?

00:06:58.238 --> 00:07:01.116
Well I, like a lot of us, spend
a lot of time complaining

00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:03.469
about how hard it is to make people change,

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:05.248
and I don't think we should fuss about it.

00:07:05.248 --> 00:07:06.844
I think we should just accept

00:07:06.844 --> 00:07:09.615
that we are an inherently conservative species.

00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:11.408
We don't like to change.

00:07:11.408 --> 00:07:14.352
It exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons.

00:07:14.352 --> 00:07:17.119
We probably wouldn't still be here today

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:19.189
if we weren't so resistant to change.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.742
It's very simple: Many thousands of years ago,

00:07:21.742 --> 00:07:23.688
we discovered that if we carried on

00:07:23.688 --> 00:07:26.118
doing the same things, we wouldn't die,

00:07:26.118 --> 00:07:27.960
because the things that we've done before

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.538
by definition didn't kill us,

00:07:29.538 --> 00:07:31.615
and therefore as long as we carry on doing them,

00:07:31.615 --> 00:07:33.022
we'll be okay,

00:07:33.022 --> 00:07:34.690
and it's very sensible not to do anything new,

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.150
because it might kill you.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.432
But of course, there are exceptions to that.

00:07:39.432 --> 00:07:41.934
Otherwise, we'd never get anywhere.

00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:43.700
And one of the exceptions, the interesting exception,

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.414
is when you can show to people

00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:47.762
that there might be some self-interest

00:07:47.762 --> 00:07:49.449
in them making that leap of faith

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:51.716
and changing a little bit.

00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:54.118
So I've spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years

00:07:54.118 --> 00:07:57.256
trying to find out what could be that self-interest

00:07:57.256 --> 00:07:59.405
that would encourage not just politicians

00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:01.958
but also businesses and general populations,

00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.973
all of us, to start to think a little more outwardly,

00:08:04.973 --> 00:08:07.212
to think in a bigger picture,

00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:10.554
not always to look inwards,
sometimes to look outwards.

00:08:10.554 --> 00:08:12.645
And this is where I discovered

00:08:12.645 --> 00:08:15.120
something quite important.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.680
In 2005, I launched a study

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.270
called the Nation Brands Index.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.778
What it is, it's a very large-scale study that polls

00:08:23.778 --> 00:08:25.865
a very large sample of the world's population,

00:08:25.865 --> 00:08:28.362
a sample that represents about 70 percent

00:08:28.362 --> 00:08:31.591
of the planet's population,

00:08:31.591 --> 00:08:33.627
and I started asking them a series of questions

00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:36.511
about how they perceive other countries.

00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:38.155
And the Nation Brands Index over the years

00:08:38.155 --> 00:08:40.658
has grown to be a very, very large database.

00:08:40.658 --> 00:08:43.090
It's about 200 billion data points

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.666
tracking what ordinary people
think about other countries

00:08:45.666 --> 00:08:47.649
and why.

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:50.411
Why did I do this? Well, because
the governments that I advise

00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:51.716
are very, very keen on knowing

00:08:51.716 --> 00:08:53.331
how they are regarded.

00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:54.776
They've known, partly because

00:08:54.776 --> 00:08:56.654
I've encouraged them to realize it,

00:08:56.654 --> 00:08:58.252
that countries depend

00:08:58.252 --> 00:08:59.808
enormously on their reputations

00:08:59.808 --> 00:09:02.755
in order to survive and prosper in the world.

00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:05.004
If a country has a great, positive image,

00:09:05.004 --> 00:09:07.521
like Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland,

00:09:07.521 --> 00:09:09.616
everything is easy and everything is cheap.

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:11.852
You get more tourists. You get more investors.

00:09:11.852 --> 00:09:13.899
You sell your products more expensively.

00:09:13.899 --> 00:09:15.857
If, on the other hand, you have a country

00:09:15.857 --> 00:09:17.870
with a very weak or a very negative image,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.300
everything is difficult and everything is expensive.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.201
So governments care desperately

00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:23.466
about the image of their country,

00:09:23.466 --> 00:09:25.600
because it makes a direct difference

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.241
to how much money they can make,

00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:28.950
and that's what they've promised their populations

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.307
they're going to deliver.

00:09:31.307 --> 00:09:33.270
So a couple of years ago, I thought I would take

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.499
some time out and speak to that gigantic database

00:09:36.499 --> 00:09:38.706
and ask it,

00:09:38.706 --> 00:09:40.598
why do some people prefer one country

00:09:40.598 --> 00:09:42.361
more than another?

00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:43.900
And the answer that the database gave me

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.596
completely staggered me.

00:09:45.596 --> 00:09:47.785
It was 6.8.

00:09:47.785 --> 00:09:49.874
I haven't got time to explain in detail.

00:09:49.874 --> 00:09:52.230
Basically what it told me was —

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.452
(Laughter) (Applause) —

00:09:56.452 --> 00:10:00.684
the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries.

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.505
We don't admire countries
primarily because they're rich,

00:10:03.505 --> 00:10:05.529
because they're powerful,
because they're successful,

00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:08.893
because they're modern, because
they're technologically advanced.

00:10:08.893 --> 00:10:11.746
We primarily admire countries that are good.

00:10:11.746 --> 00:10:13.109
What do we mean by good?

00:10:13.109 --> 00:10:14.780
We mean countries that seem to contribute

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.349
something to the world in which we live,

00:10:17.349 --> 00:10:19.908
countries that actually make the world safer

00:10:19.908 --> 00:10:22.485
or better or richer or fairer.

00:10:22.485 --> 00:10:23.950
Those are the countries we like.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.471
This is a discovery of significant importance —

00:10:26.471 --> 00:10:27.824
you see where I'm going —

00:10:27.824 --> 00:10:29.691
because it squares the circle.

00:10:29.691 --> 00:10:32.563
I can now say, and often do, to any government,

00:10:32.563 --> 00:10:35.421
in order to do well, you need to do good.

00:10:35.421 --> 00:10:36.916
If you want to sell more products,

00:10:36.916 --> 00:10:38.452
if you want to get more investment,

00:10:38.452 --> 00:10:41.450
if you want to become more competitive,

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.115
then you need to start behaving,

00:10:43.115 --> 00:10:44.758
because that's why people will respect you

00:10:44.758 --> 00:10:46.827
and do business with you,

00:10:46.827 --> 00:10:49.910
and therefore, the more you collaborate,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.755
the more competitive you become.

00:10:52.755 --> 00:10:54.533
This is quite an important discovery,

00:10:54.533 --> 00:10:55.613
and as soon as I discovered this,

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.858
I felt another index coming on.

00:10:57.858 --> 00:11:00.204
I swear that as I get older, my ideas become simpler

00:11:00.204 --> 00:11:01.500
and more and more childish.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.468
This one is called the Good Country Index,

00:11:05.468 --> 00:11:09.521
and it does exactly what it says on the tin.

00:11:09.521 --> 00:11:11.875
It measures, or at least it tries to measure,

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:14.638
exactly how much each country on Earth contributes

00:11:14.638 --> 00:11:17.793
not to its own population but to the rest of humanity.

00:11:17.793 --> 00:11:19.060
Bizarrely, nobody had ever thought

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.749
of measuring this before.

00:11:20.749 --> 00:11:22.796
So my colleague Dr. Robert Govers and I have spent

00:11:22.796 --> 00:11:24.539
the best part of the last two years,

00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:28.193
with the help of a large number
of very serious and clever people,

00:11:28.193 --> 00:11:30.879
cramming together all the reliable data in the world

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:33.522
we could find about what countries give

00:11:33.522 --> 00:11:35.115
to the world.

00:11:35.115 --> 00:11:37.493
And you're waiting for me to
tell you which one comes top.

00:11:37.493 --> 00:11:39.221
And I'm going to tell you,

00:11:39.221 --> 00:11:40.751
but first of all I want to tell you

00:11:40.751 --> 00:11:43.456
precisely what I mean

00:11:43.456 --> 00:11:45.515
when I say a good country.

00:11:45.515 --> 00:11:47.739
I do not mean morally good.

00:11:47.739 --> 00:11:49.701
When I say that Country X

00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:51.714
is the goodest country on Earth,

00:11:51.714 --> 00:11:53.023
and I mean goodest, I don't mean best.

00:11:53.023 --> 00:11:54.476
Best is something different.

00:11:54.476 --> 00:11:55.770
When you're talking about a good country,

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.904
you can be good, gooder and goodest.

00:11:57.904 --> 00:12:01.376
It's not the same thing as good, better and best.

00:12:01.376 --> 00:12:03.877
This is a country which simply gives more

00:12:03.877 --> 00:12:06.203
to humanity than any other country.

00:12:06.203 --> 00:12:07.945
I don't talk about how they behave at home

00:12:07.945 --> 00:12:10.345
because that's measured elsewhere.

00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:12.405
And the winner is

00:12:12.405 --> 00:12:14.216
Ireland.

00:12:14.216 --> 00:12:19.890
(Applause)

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.795
According to the data here,

00:12:21.795 --> 00:12:24.685
no country on Earth, per head of population,

00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:27.610
per dollar of GDP, contributes more

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.246
to the world that we live in than Ireland.

00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:30.341
What does this mean?

00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:32.563
This means that as we go to sleep at night,

00:12:32.563 --> 00:12:35.631
all of us in the last 15 seconds
before we drift off to sleep,

00:12:35.631 --> 00:12:37.626
our final thought should be,

00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:39.943
godammit, I'm glad that Ireland exists.

00:12:39.943 --> 00:12:42.141
(Laughter)

00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:49.238
And that — (Applause) —

00:12:49.238 --> 00:12:52.238
In the depths of a very severe economic recession,

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.756
I think that there's a really important lesson there,

00:12:54.756 --> 00:12:56.872
that if you can remember
your international obligations

00:12:56.872 --> 00:12:58.842
whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy,

00:12:58.842 --> 00:12:59.880
that's really something.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.535
Finland ranks pretty much the same.

00:13:01.535 --> 00:13:02.800
The only reason why it's below Ireland

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.883
is because its lowest score is
lower than Ireland's lowest score.

00:13:05.883 --> 00:13:07.680
Now the other thing you'll
notice about the top 10 there

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.540
is, of course, they're all, apart from New Zealand,

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.250
Western European nations.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.930
They're also all rich.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.670
This depressed me,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.182
because one of the things that I did not want

00:13:17.182 --> 00:13:18.760
to discover with this index

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.116
is that it's purely the province of rich countries

00:13:21.116 --> 00:13:22.141
to help poor countries.

00:13:22.141 --> 00:13:24.197
This is not what it's all about.

00:13:24.197 --> 00:13:25.773
And indeed, if you look further down the list,

00:13:25.773 --> 00:13:28.099
I don't have the slide here, you will see

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.388
something that made me very happy indeed,

00:13:30.388 --> 00:13:32.919
that Kenya is in the top 30,

00:13:32.919 --> 00:13:35.804
and that demonstrates one
very, very important thing.

00:13:35.804 --> 00:13:37.667
This is not about money.

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:39.064
This is about attitude.

00:13:39.064 --> 00:13:40.530
This is about culture.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.977
This is about a government and a people that care

00:13:43.977 --> 00:13:45.171
about the rest of the world

00:13:45.171 --> 00:13:47.163
and have the imagination and the courage

00:13:47.163 --> 00:13:50.400
to think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.180
I'm going to whip through the other slides

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.128
just so you can see some
of the lower-lying countries.

00:13:55.128 --> 00:13:58.410
There's Germany at 13th, the U.S. comes 21st,

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.151
Mexico comes 66th,

00:14:00.151 --> 00:14:02.269
and then we have some of
the big developing countries,

00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:05.409
like Russia at 95th, China at 107th.

00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:08.413
Countries like China and Russia and India,

00:14:08.413 --> 00:14:10.966
which is down in the same part of the index,

00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:13.319
well, in some ways, it's not surprising.

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:14.858
They've spent a great deal of time

00:14:14.858 --> 00:14:17.021
over the last decades building their own economy,

00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:19.707
building their own society and their own polity,

00:14:19.707 --> 00:14:21.373
but it is to be hoped

00:14:21.373 --> 00:14:22.740
that the second phase of their growth

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.725
will be somewhat more outward-looking

00:14:24.725 --> 00:14:27.252
than the first phase has been so far.

00:14:27.252 --> 00:14:29.360
And then you can break down each country

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.716
in terms of the actual datasets that build into it.

00:14:32.716 --> 00:14:33.565
I'll allow you to do that.

00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:36.227
From midnight tonight it's going
to be on goodcountry.org,

00:14:36.227 --> 00:14:37.410
and you can look at the country.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.278
You can look right down to the
level of the individual datasets.

00:14:41.278 --> 00:14:43.496
Now that's the Good Country Index.

00:14:43.496 --> 00:14:44.865
What's it there for?

00:14:44.865 --> 00:14:47.150
Well, it's there really because I want to try

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.601
to introduce this word,

00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:53.924
or reintroduce this word, into the discourse.

00:14:53.924 --> 00:14:56.113
I've had enough hearing about competitive countries.

00:14:56.113 --> 00:14:57.908
I've had enough hearing about

00:14:57.908 --> 00:15:01.694
prosperous, wealthy, fast-growing countries.

00:15:01.694 --> 00:15:04.942
I've even had enough hearing about happy countries

00:15:04.942 --> 00:15:06.983
because in the end that's still selfish.

00:15:06.983 --> 00:15:08.487
That's still about us,

00:15:08.487 --> 00:15:10.355
and if we carry on thinking about us,

00:15:10.355 --> 00:15:12.897
we are in deep, deep trouble.

00:15:12.897 --> 00:15:14.528
I think we all know what it is

00:15:14.528 --> 00:15:15.651
that we want to hear about.

00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:18.696
We want to hear about good countries,

00:15:18.696 --> 00:15:22.326
and so I want to ask you all a favor.

00:15:22.326 --> 00:15:23.922
I'm not asking a lot.

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:25.875
It's something that you might find easy to do

00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:26.900
and you might even find enjoyable

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.503
and even helpful to do,

00:15:28.503 --> 00:15:31.785
and that's simply to start using the word "good"

00:15:31.785 --> 00:15:33.467
in this context.

00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:35.654
When you think about your own country,

00:15:35.654 --> 00:15:37.783
when you think about other people's countries,

00:15:37.783 --> 00:15:39.566
when you think about companies,

00:15:39.566 --> 00:15:41.777
when you talk about the world that we live in today,

00:15:41.777 --> 00:15:43.675
start using that word

00:15:43.675 --> 00:15:46.443
in the way that I've talked about this evening.

00:15:46.443 --> 00:15:48.347
Not good, the opposite of bad,

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:50.623
because that's an argument that never finishes.

00:15:50.623 --> 00:15:52.967
Good, the opposite of selfish,

00:15:52.967 --> 00:15:56.150
good being a country that thinks about all of us.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.560
That's what I would like you to do,

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.945
and I'd like you to use it as a stick

00:15:58.945 --> 00:16:01.588
with which to beat your politicians.

00:16:01.588 --> 00:16:03.895
When you elect them, when you reelect them,

00:16:03.895 --> 00:16:05.307
when you vote for them, when you listen

00:16:05.307 --> 00:16:07.842
to what they're offering you,

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.554
use that word, "good,"

00:16:09.554 --> 00:16:11.038
and ask yourself,

00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:13.111
"Is that what a good country would do?"

00:16:13.111 --> 00:16:16.404
And if the answer is no, be very suspicious.

00:16:16.404 --> 00:16:18.829
Ask yourself, is that the behavior

00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:20.265
of my country?

00:16:20.265 --> 00:16:22.397
Do I want to come from a country

00:16:22.397 --> 00:16:23.964
where the government, in my name,

00:16:23.964 --> 00:16:25.826
is doing things like that?

00:16:25.826 --> 00:16:27.582
Or do I, on the other hand,

00:16:27.582 --> 00:16:29.210
prefer the idea of walking around the world

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.364
with my head held high thinking, "Yeah,

00:16:31.364 --> 00:16:33.855
I'm proud to come from a good country"?

00:16:33.855 --> 00:16:35.843
And everybody will welcome you.

00:16:35.843 --> 00:16:37.467
And everybody in the last 15 seconds

00:16:37.467 --> 00:16:40.137
before they drift off to sleep at night will say,

00:16:40.137 --> 00:16:43.018
"Gosh, I'm glad that person's country exists."

00:16:43.018 --> 00:16:45.205
Ultimately, that, I think,

00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:46.959
is what will make the change.

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:48.676
That word, "good,"

00:16:48.676 --> 00:16:50.323
and the number 6.8

00:16:50.323 --> 00:16:52.581
and the discovery that's behind it

00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:54.249
have changed my life.

00:16:54.249 --> 00:16:56.136
I think they can change your life,

00:16:56.136 --> 00:16:57.995
and I think we can use it to change

00:16:57.995 --> 00:17:00.415
the way that our politicians
and our companies behave,

00:17:00.415 --> 00:17:04.280
and in doing so, we can change the world.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.830
I've started thinking very differently about

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.523
my own country since I've been
thinking about these things.

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:10.610
I used to think that I wanted to live in a rich country,

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:13.010
and then I started thinking I
wanted to live in a happy country,

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.624
but I began to realize, it's not enough.

00:17:15.624 --> 00:17:17.669
I don't want to live in a rich country.

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:19.602
I don't want to live in a fast-growing

00:17:19.602 --> 00:17:22.285
or competitive country.

00:17:22.285 --> 00:17:25.403
I want to live in a good country,

00:17:25.403 --> 00:17:28.896
and I so, so hope that you do too.

00:17:28.896 --> 00:17:31.480
Thank you.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.480
(Applause)
