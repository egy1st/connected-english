WEBVTT

00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.539
I'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise.

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:07.899
I soared through the galaxy

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.635
driving a huge starship

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:12.034
with a crew made up of people

00:00:12.034 --> 00:00:14.970
from all over this world,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.420
many different races, many different cultures,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.264
many different heritages,

00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:22.221
all working together,

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:25.866
and our mission was to explore strange new worlds,

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:29.742
to seek out new life and new civilizations,

00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:34.705
to boldly go where no one has gone before.

00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:36.190
Well —

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.654
(Applause) —

00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:47.561
I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan

00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:49.692
who went to America,

00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:53.177
boldly going to a strange new world,

00:00:53.177 --> 00:00:56.013
seeking new opportunities.

00:00:56.013 --> 00:00:59.499
My mother was born in Sacramento, California.

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:01.940
My father was a San Franciscan.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.685
They met and married in Los Angeles,

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:08.406
and I was born there.

00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:10.659
I was four years old

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.489
when Pearl Harbor was bombed

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:17.231
on December 7, 1941 by Japan,

00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:21.240
and overnight, the world was plunged

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.674
into a world war.

00:01:24.674 --> 00:01:27.627
America suddenly was swept up

00:01:27.627 --> 00:01:31.551
by hysteria.

00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:33.025
Japanese-Americans,

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:36.185
American citizens of Japanese ancestry,

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:37.520
were looked on

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.542
with suspicion and fear

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:44.514
and with outright hatred

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:47.174
simply because we happened to look like

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:49.870
the people that bombed Pearl Harbor.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.340
And the hysteria grew and grew

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.930
until in February 1942,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.074
the president of the United States,

00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:01.244
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

00:02:01.244 --> 00:02:03.917
ordered all Japanese-Americans

00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:06.026
on the West Coast of America

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:08.942
to be summarily rounded up

00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:12.147
with no charges, with no trial,

00:02:12.147 --> 00:02:14.574
with no due process.

00:02:14.574 --> 00:02:17.165
Due process, this is a core pillar

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:18.778
of our justice system.

00:02:18.778 --> 00:02:21.207
That all disappeared.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.306
We were to be rounded up

00:02:23.306 --> 00:02:27.567
and imprisoned in 10 barbed-wire prison camps

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:31.759
in some of the most desolate places in America:

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:35.186
the blistering hot desert of Arizona,

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:38.651
the sultry swamps of Arkansas,

00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:42.344
the wastelands of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,

00:02:42.344 --> 00:02:47.778
and two of the most desolate places in California.

00:02:47.778 --> 00:02:52.546
On April 20th, I celebrated my fifth birthday,

00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:56.163
and just a few weeks after my birthday,

00:02:56.163 --> 00:02:58.934
my parents got my younger brother,

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:00.992
my baby sister and me

00:03:00.992 --> 00:03:03.021
up very early one morning,

00:03:03.021 --> 00:03:06.246
and they dressed us hurriedly.

00:03:06.246 --> 00:03:08.240
My brother and I were in the living room

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.303
looking out the front window,

00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:15.147
and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway.

00:03:15.147 --> 00:03:19.669
They carried bayonets on their rifles.

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.470
They stomped up the front porch

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.989
and banged on the door.

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.094
My father answered it,

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:31.835
and the soldiers ordered us out of our home.

00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:34.160
My father gave my brother and me

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.902
small luggages to carry,

00:03:35.902 --> 00:03:39.418
and we walked out and stood on the driveway

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:42.413
waiting for our mother to come out,

00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:45.728
and when my mother finally came out,

00:03:45.728 --> 00:03:48.791
she had our baby sister in one arm,

00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.163
a huge duffel bag in the other,

00:03:52.163 --> 00:03:57.305
and tears were streaming down both her cheeks.

00:03:57.305 --> 00:04:01.092
I will never be able to forget that scene.

00:04:01.092 --> 00:04:05.440
It is burned into my memory.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.231
We were taken from our home

00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:10.749
and loaded on to train cars

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.759
with other Japanese-American families.

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.239
There were guards stationed

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.699
at both ends of each car,

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.398
as if we were criminals.

00:04:21.398 --> 00:04:25.555
We were taken two thirds of
the way across the country,

00:04:25.555 --> 00:04:29.767
rocking on that train for four days and three nights,

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:33.502
to the swamps of Arkansas.

00:04:33.502 --> 00:04:35.515
I still remember the barbed wire fence

00:04:35.515 --> 00:04:38.125
that confined me.

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:40.712
I remember the tall sentry tower

00:04:40.712 --> 00:04:44.965
with the machine guns pointed at us.

00:04:44.965 --> 00:04:47.654
I remember the searchlight that followed me

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:49.093
when I made the night runs

00:04:49.093 --> 00:04:52.344
from my barrack to the latrine.

00:04:52.344 --> 00:04:54.504
But to five-year-old me,

00:04:54.504 --> 00:04:56.800
I thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.054
for me to pee.

00:05:00.054 --> 00:05:01.947
I was a child,

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:04.572
too young to understand the circumstances

00:05:04.572 --> 00:05:07.003
of my being there.

00:05:07.003 --> 00:05:11.769
Children are amazingly adaptable.

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:15.326
What would be grotesquely abnormal

00:05:15.326 --> 00:05:18.180
became my normality

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.794
in the prisoner of war camps.

00:05:21.794 --> 00:05:25.484
It became routine for me to line up three times a day

00:05:25.484 --> 00:05:30.231
to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall.

00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:32.436
It became normal for me to go with my father

00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:35.384
to bathe in a mass shower.

00:05:35.384 --> 00:05:39.645
Being in a prison, a barbed-wire prison camp,

00:05:39.645 --> 00:05:43.269
became my normality.

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:44.910
When the war ended,

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.962
we were released,

00:05:46.962 --> 00:05:48.968
and given a one-way ticket

00:05:48.968 --> 00:05:52.534
to anywhere in the United States.

00:05:52.534 --> 00:05:54.435
My parents decided to go back home

00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:57.003
to Los Angeles,

00:05:57.003 --> 00:06:01.384
but Los Angeles was not a welcoming place.

00:06:01.384 --> 00:06:02.780
We were penniless.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.256
Everything had been taken from us,

00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:07.689
and the hostility was intense.

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:10.540
Our first home was on Skid Row

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.493
in the lowest part of our city,

00:06:15.493 --> 00:06:18.060
living with derelicts, drunkards

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.080
and crazy people,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.674
the stench of urine all over,

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:25.787
on the street, in the alley,

00:06:25.787 --> 00:06:28.108
in the hallway.

00:06:28.108 --> 00:06:30.810
It was a horrible experience,

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.226
and for us kids, it was terrorizing.

00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:36.738
I remember once

00:06:36.738 --> 00:06:39.690
a drunkard came staggering down,

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.207
fell down right in front of us,

00:06:42.207 --> 00:06:43.857
and threw up.

00:06:43.857 --> 00:06:49.174
My baby sister said, "Mama, let's go back home,"

00:06:49.174 --> 00:06:51.480
because behind barbed wires

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.096
was for us

00:06:54.096 --> 00:06:56.939
home.

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.590
My parents worked hard

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.547
to get back on their feet.

00:07:00.547 --> 00:07:01.666
We had lost everything.

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:04.170
They were at the middle of their lives

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.805
and starting all over.

00:07:05.805 --> 00:07:08.354
They worked their fingers to the bone,

00:07:08.354 --> 00:07:11.632
and ultimately they were able

00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:14.120
to get the capital together to buy

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.285
a three-bedroom home in a nice neighborhood.

00:07:17.285 --> 00:07:18.876
And I was a teenager,

00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:20.670
and I became very curious

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.940
about my childhood imprisonment.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.980
I had read civics books that told me about

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.691
the ideals of American democracy.

00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:33.356
All men are created equal,

00:07:33.356 --> 00:07:36.267
we have an inalienable right

00:07:36.267 --> 00:07:41.206
to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,

00:07:41.206 --> 00:07:43.440
and I couldn't quite make that fit

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.829
with what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment.

00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:48.910
I read history books,

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.781
and I couldn't find anything about it.

00:07:51.781 --> 00:07:55.685
And so I engaged my father after dinner

00:07:55.685 --> 00:08:00.245
in long, sometimes heated conversations.

00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:03.013
We had many, many conversations like that,

00:08:03.013 --> 00:08:05.792
and what I got from them

00:08:05.792 --> 00:08:07.982
was my father's wisdom.

00:08:07.982 --> 00:08:10.294
He was the one that suffered the most

00:08:10.294 --> 00:08:13.760
under those conditions of imprisonment,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.737
and yet he understood American democracy.

00:08:17.737 --> 00:08:20.464
He told me that our democracy

00:08:20.464 --> 00:08:22.571
is a people's democracy,

00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:25.630
and it can be as great as the people can be,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.821
but it is also as fallible as people are.

00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:33.081
He told me that American democracy

00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:37.077
is vitally dependent on good people

00:08:37.077 --> 00:08:41.048
who cherish the ideals of our system

00:08:41.048 --> 00:08:44.548
and actively engage in the process

00:08:44.548 --> 00:08:47.278
of making our democracy work.

00:08:47.278 --> 00:08:51.343
And he took me to a campaign headquarters —

00:08:51.343 --> 00:08:55.134
the governor of Illinois was
running for the presidency —

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:59.822
and introduced me to American electoral politics.

00:08:59.822 --> 00:09:02.183
And he also told me about

00:09:02.183 --> 00:09:03.961
young Japanese-Americans

00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.021
during the Second World War.

00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:09.825
When Pearl Harbor was bombed,

00:09:09.825 --> 00:09:12.806
young Japanese-Americans,
like all young Americans,

00:09:12.806 --> 00:09:15.304
rushed to their draft board

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:18.712
to volunteer to fight for our country.

00:09:18.712 --> 00:09:21.144
That act of patriotism

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:25.462
was answered with a slap in the face.

00:09:25.462 --> 00:09:28.466
We were denied service,

00:09:28.466 --> 00:09:34.328
and categorized as enemy non-alien.

00:09:34.328 --> 00:09:37.372
It was outrageous to be called an enemy

00:09:37.372 --> 00:09:40.590
when you're volunteering to fight for your country,

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.960
but that was compounded with the word "non-alien,"

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.070
which is a word that means

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:52.111
"citizen" in the negative.

00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:55.761
They even took the word "citizen" away from us,

00:09:55.761 --> 00:10:00.389
and imprisoned them for a whole year.

00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:02.377
And then the government realized

00:10:02.377 --> 00:10:06.747
that there's a wartime manpower shortage,

00:10:06.747 --> 00:10:11.126
and as suddenly as they'd rounded us up,

00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:13.253
they opened up the military for service

00:10:13.253 --> 00:10:16.171
by young Japanese-Americans.

00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:18.838
It was totally irrational,

00:10:18.838 --> 00:10:21.072
but the amazing thing,

00:10:21.072 --> 00:10:23.429
the astounding thing,

00:10:23.429 --> 00:10:25.382
is that thousands of young

00:10:25.382 --> 00:10:28.340
Japanese-American men and women

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.303
again went from behind those barbed-wire fences,

00:10:32.303 --> 00:10:35.760
put on the same uniform as that of our guards,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.288
leaving their families in imprisonment,

00:10:39.288 --> 00:10:41.602
to fight for this country.

00:10:41.602 --> 00:10:43.563
They said that they were going to fight

00:10:43.563 --> 00:10:46.829
not only to get their families out

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:49.387
from behind those barbed-wire fences,

00:10:49.387 --> 00:10:52.617
but because they cherished the very ideal

00:10:52.617 --> 00:10:54.840
of what our government stands for,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.731
should stand for,

00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:59.232
and that was being abrogated

00:10:59.232 --> 00:11:03.145
by what was being done.

00:11:03.145 --> 00:11:05.479
All men are created equal.

00:11:05.479 --> 00:11:09.300
And they went to fight for this country.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.980
They were put into a segregated

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.202
all Japanese-American unit

00:11:13.202 --> 00:11:15.826
and sent to the battlefields of Europe,

00:11:15.826 --> 00:11:18.897
and they threw themselves into it.

00:11:18.897 --> 00:11:21.742
They fought with amazing,

00:11:21.742 --> 00:11:25.200
incredible courage and valor.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.962
They were sent out on the most dangerous missions

00:11:28.962 --> 00:11:31.843
and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate

00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:35.649
of any unit proportionally.

00:11:35.649 --> 00:11:38.944
There is one battle that illustrates that.

00:11:38.944 --> 00:11:41.988
It was a battle for the Gothic Line.

00:11:41.988 --> 00:11:44.290
The Germans were embedded

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.877
in this mountain hillside,

00:11:46.877 --> 00:11:48.449
rocky hillside,

00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:50.929
in impregnable caves,

00:11:50.929 --> 00:11:54.200
and three allied battalions

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.978
had been pounding away at it

00:11:55.978 --> 00:11:57.462
for six months,

00:11:57.462 --> 00:11:59.892
and they were stalemated.

00:11:59.892 --> 00:12:02.786
The 442nd was called in

00:12:02.786 --> 00:12:06.108
to add to the fight,

00:12:06.108 --> 00:12:08.274
but the men of the 442nd

00:12:08.274 --> 00:12:11.434
came up with a unique

00:12:11.434 --> 00:12:13.734
but dangerous idea:

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:15.529
The backside of the mountain

00:12:15.529 --> 00:12:18.190
was a sheer rock cliff.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.599
The Germans thought an attack from the backside

00:12:21.599 --> 00:12:24.109
would be impossible.

00:12:24.109 --> 00:12:28.480
The men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.223
On a dark, moonless night,

00:12:32.223 --> 00:12:36.471
they began scaling that rock wall,

00:12:36.471 --> 00:12:40.090
a drop of more than 1,000 feet,

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.737
in full combat gear.

00:12:42.737 --> 00:12:45.581
They climbed all night long

00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:48.631
on that sheer cliff.

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:52.232
In the darkness,

00:12:52.232 --> 00:12:54.312
some lost their handhold

00:12:54.312 --> 00:12:55.925
or their footing

00:12:55.925 --> 00:12:58.122
and they fell to their deaths

00:12:58.122 --> 00:13:00.203
in the ravine below.

00:13:00.203 --> 00:13:04.630
They all fell silently.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.195
Not a single one cried out,

00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:10.427
so as not to give their position away.

00:13:10.427 --> 00:13:14.285
The men climbed for eight hours straight,

00:13:14.285 --> 00:13:17.404
and those who made it to the top

00:13:17.404 --> 00:13:21.886
stayed there until the first break of light,

00:13:21.886 --> 00:13:24.965
and as soon as light broke,

00:13:24.965 --> 00:13:26.558
they attacked.

00:13:26.558 --> 00:13:28.212
The Germans were surprised,

00:13:28.212 --> 00:13:29.960
and they took the hill

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.970
and broke the Gothic Line.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.258
A six-month stalemate

00:13:35.258 --> 00:13:37.463
was broken by the 442nd

00:13:37.463 --> 00:13:40.444
in 32 minutes.

00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:44.080
It was an amazing act,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.930
and when the war ended,

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.147
the 442nd returned to the United States

00:13:50.147 --> 00:13:52.563
as the most decorated unit

00:13:52.563 --> 00:13:55.480
of the entire Second World War.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.210
They were greeted back on the White House Lawn

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.816
by President Truman, who said to them,

00:14:00.816 --> 00:14:04.074
"You fought not only the enemy

00:14:04.074 --> 00:14:08.694
but prejudice, and you won."

00:14:08.694 --> 00:14:12.290
They are my heroes.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.337
They clung to their belief

00:14:15.337 --> 00:14:18.389
in the shining ideals of this country,

00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:22.680
and they proved that being an American

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.890
is not just for some people,

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:31.323
that race is not how we define being an American.

00:14:31.323 --> 00:14:34.900
They expanded what it means to be an American,

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.224
including Japanese-Americans

00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:41.398
that were feared and suspected and hated.

00:14:41.398 --> 00:14:44.609
They were change agents,

00:14:44.609 --> 00:14:47.091
and they left for me

00:14:47.091 --> 00:14:49.308
a legacy.

00:14:49.308 --> 00:14:51.097
They are my heroes

00:14:51.097 --> 00:14:53.448
and my father is my hero,

00:14:53.448 --> 00:14:55.258
who understood democracy

00:14:55.258 --> 00:14:59.329
and guided me through it.

00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:01.819
They gave me a legacy,

00:15:01.819 --> 00:15:05.181
and with that legacy comes a responsibility,

00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:07.597
and I am dedicated

00:15:07.597 --> 00:15:09.586
to making my country

00:15:09.586 --> 00:15:12.790
an even better America,

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.000
to making our government

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.497
an even truer democracy,

00:15:18.497 --> 00:15:22.237
and because of the heroes that I have

00:15:22.237 --> 00:15:25.859
and the struggles that we've gone through,

00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:27.858
I can stand before you

00:15:27.858 --> 00:15:30.717
as a gay Japanese-American,

00:15:30.717 --> 00:15:33.184
but even more than that,

00:15:33.184 --> 00:15:37.192
I am a proud American.

00:15:37.192 --> 00:15:39.379
Thank you very much.

00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:41.350
(Applause)
