WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
among the smartest of the smart.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
There's a Jewish saying that I love.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What is truer than truth? Answer: The story.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
about our common humanity.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
All stories interest me, and some haunt me

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
until I end up writing them.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Certain themes keep coming up:

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
freedom.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm aware of the mystery around us,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so I write about coincidences, premonitions,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In the last 20 years I have published a few books,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
(Laughter)

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
of the opening ceremony,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
called me and said that I had been selected

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to be one of the flag-bearers.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
without a walker.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
(Laughter)

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I was told that this was no laughing matter.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This would be the first time

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that only women would carry the Olympic flag.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Five women, representing five continents,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and three Olympic gold medal winners.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
My first question was, naturally,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
what was I going to wear?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
(Laughter)

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
A uniform, she said,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and asked for my measurements.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
My measurements.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
looking like the Michelin Man.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
(Laughter)

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
By the middle of February,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
can determine the result of a race or a game.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It is all about passion.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The streets of Turin were covered with red posters

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
announcing the slogan of the Olympics.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Passion lives here. Isn't it always true?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That is what I need for my characters in my books:

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
a passionate heart.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
People like all of you in this room.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
(Laughter)

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
They only make good former spouses.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
(Laughter)

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
(Applause)

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
In the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers:

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
three athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Also, two women with passionate hearts:

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Wangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
who has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
she has changed the soil, the weather,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
in some places in Africa, and of course

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
the economic conditions in many villages.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
against child prostitution.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And of brothels where children are forced to receive five,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
15 clients per day,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
In the green room I received my uniform.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
but it was far from the Michelin Man suit

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that I had anticipated. Not bad, really.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I looked like a refrigerator.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
(Laughter)

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
the universal symbol of beauty and passion.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I don't know.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
She replied, "Posture. My back is always straight,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and I don't make old people's noises."

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
(Laughter)

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So, there you have some free advice

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
from one of the most beautiful women on earth.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
no talking to yourselves, no farting.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
(Laughter)

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Well, she didn't say that exactly.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
(Laughter)

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
At some point around midnight,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
we were summoned to the wings of the stadium,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started --

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
by the way, the same music that starts here,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
the Aida March.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
not counting the poofy hair.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
(Laughter)

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
(Laughter)

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
-- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
so that my head was actually under the damn flag.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
(Laughter)

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
All the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
That was fortunate for me, because in most press photos

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
(Laughter)

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
A place where most men would love to be.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
(Laughter)

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
(Applause)

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
The best four minutes of my entire life

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
were those in the Olympic stadium.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
My husband is offended when I say this --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
although I have explained to him that what we do in private

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
usually takes less than four minutes --

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
(Laughter)

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
-- so he shouldn't take it personally.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
because I don't want to forget them

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
when old age destroys my brain cells.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics --

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
passion.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So here's a tale of passion.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
for Tutsi refugees in Congo.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
are women and girls.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
We can call this place in Congo a death camp,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
The protagonists of this story

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
are a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
She's pregnant and a widow.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Soldiers have forced her to watch

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
as her husband was tortured and killed.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Two tiny little boys.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and ties it with her own hair.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
She names the twins after the camp's commanders

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
to gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
because her milk cannot sustain them.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
even when they hold a gun to her head.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Somehow, the family survives for 16 months,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
where they're now living and thriving.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
like Rose Mapendo.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I don't make them up. There's no need for that.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I look around and I see them everywhere.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I have worked with women and for women all my life.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I know them well.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
although the term had not reached Chile yet,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
(Laughter)

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
for my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
I was able to deliver two.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
(Laughter)

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Once, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
she said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
who are still forced into premature marriage,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
prostitution, forced labor --

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They have no control over their bodies or their lives.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
They have no education and no freedom.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
For most Western young women of today,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
being called a feminist is an insult.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that it never stopped me from flirting,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
(Laughter)

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Feminism is not dead, by no means.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
It has evolved. If you don't like the term,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
change it, for Goddess' sake.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want;

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
the name doesn't matter,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
The year is 2005.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Jenny is a young American dental hygienist

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
during her three-week vacation.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
She's prepared to clean teeth,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Outside, there is a line of women

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
who have waited several hours to be treated.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
The first patient is in excruciating pain

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
because she has several rotten molars.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
She risks a lot and she's terrified.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
She doesn't even have the proper instruments,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
The woman's face looks like a watermelon.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
The husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Jenny is horrified at what she has done,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
but then the translator explains

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
in time to prepare dinner for him.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Millions of women live like this today.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
They are the poorest of the poor.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
they own less than one percent of the world's assets.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
They are paid less than men for the same work

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
if they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
because they have no economic independence,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and they are constantly threatened by exploitation,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
violence and abuse.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
It is a fact that giving women education, work,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
the ability to control their own income,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
inherit and own property, benefits the society.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
If a woman is empowered,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
her children and her family will be better off.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
If families prosper, the village prospers,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and eventually so does the whole country.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
because they have cut and sold the trees.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
She gets the women to plant new trees and water them,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
drop by drop.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
The poorest and most backward societies

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
are always those that put women down.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and also by philanthropy.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
For every dollar given to a women's program,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
20 dollars are given to men's programs.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Women are 51 percent of humankind.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Empowering them will change everything --

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
more than technology and design and entertainment.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I can promise you that women working together --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
linked, informed and educated --

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
mainly women and children. They are collateral damage.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Men run the world, and look at the mess we have.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
What kind of world do we want?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We want a world where life is preserved

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and the quality of life is enriched for everybody,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
not only for the privileged.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
at the UC Berkeley library.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
No museum or gallery in the United States,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
has dared to show the paintings because the theme

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
is the Abu Ghraib prison.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
in the voluminous Botero style.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
or my heart.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
What I fear most is power with impunity.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
In our species, the alpha males define reality,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and follow the rules.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and in this case, the trickle-down effect,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
which does not work in economics, works perfectly.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse --

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
a woman or a child.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
through gender, income, race, and class.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
in our civilization.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
But for real change, we need feminine energy

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
in the management of the world.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
We need a critical number of women in positions of power,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
(Laughter)

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
and legendary breasts.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I want to make this world good.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Not better, but to make it good.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room --

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and get to work, passionately,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
in creating an almost perfect world.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Thank you.
