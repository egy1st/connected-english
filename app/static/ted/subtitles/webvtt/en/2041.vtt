00:00:00.543 --> 00:00:03.286
On March 10, 2011,

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:06.293
I was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab

00:00:06.293 --> 00:00:09.522
meeting with faculty, students and staff,

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:11.311
and we were trying to figure out whether

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.671
I should be the next director.

00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:16.040
That night, at midnight,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.810
a magnitude 9 earthquake

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.676
hit off of the Pacific coast of Japan.

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:22.961
My wife and family were in Japan,

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:26.271
and as the news started to come in,

00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:27.970
I was panicking.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.232
I was looking at the news streams

00:00:29.232 --> 00:00:32.060
and listening to the press conferences

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.270
of the government officials

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.860
and the Tokyo Power Company,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.411
and hearing about this explosion

00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:39.610
at the nuclear reactors

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.291
and this cloud of fallout

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.190
that was headed towards our house

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.089
which was only about 200 kilometers away.

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.920
And the people on TV weren't telling us

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.860
anything that we wanted to hear.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.820
I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.242
what was going on with the radiation,

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.570
whether my family was in danger.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.759
So I did what instinctively felt like the right thing,

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:01.430
which was to go onto the Internet

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.772
and try to figure out

00:01:02.772 --> 00:01:05.183
if I could take matters into my own hands.

00:01:05.183 --> 00:01:07.024
On the Net, I found there were a lot of other people

00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:09.090
like me trying to figure out what was going on,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.306
and together we sort of loosely formed a group

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:13.777
and we called it Safecast,

00:01:13.777 --> 00:01:14.949
and we decided we were going to try

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.695
to measure the radiation

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:18.469
and get the data out to everybody else,

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.141
because it was clear that the government

00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:23.043
wasn't going to be doing this for us.

00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:24.460
Three years later,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.554
we have 16 million data points,

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.299
we have designed our own Geiger counters

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.952
that you can download the designs

00:01:31.952 --> 00:01:32.826
and plug it into the network.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.730
We have an app that shows you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.757
most of the radiation in Japan
and other parts of the world.

00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:39.962
We are arguably one of the most successful

00:01:39.962 --> 00:01:41.817
citizen science projects in the world,

00:01:41.817 --> 00:01:44.169
and we have created

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:47.670
the largest open dataset of radiation measurements.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.412
And the interesting thing here

00:01:50.412 --> 00:01:55.060
is how did — (Applause) — Thank you.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.151
How did a bunch of amateurs

00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:59.320
who really didn't know what we were doing

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.009
somehow come together

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.193
and do what NGOs and the government

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.611
were completely incapable of doing?

00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:09.369
And I would suggest that this has something to do

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.129
with the Internet. It's not a fluke.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.980
It wasn't luck, and it wasn't because it was us.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.398
It helped that it was an event

00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:17.033
that pulled everybody together,

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:18.791
but it was a new way of doing things

00:02:18.791 --> 00:02:20.870
that was enabled by the Internet

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.462
and a lot of the other things that were going on,

00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:24.475
and I want to talk a little bit about

00:02:24.475 --> 00:02:27.144
what those new principles are.

00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:31.952
So remember before the Internet? (Laughter)

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:33.740
I call this B.I. Okay?

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.351
So, in B.I., life was simple.

00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.097
Things were Euclidian, Newtonian,

00:02:40.097 --> 00:02:41.556
somewhat predictable.

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:43.966
People actually tried to predict the future,

00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:45.680
even the economists.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.894
And then the Internet happened,

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:50.965
and the world became extremely complex,

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:53.602
extremely low-cost, extremely fast,

00:02:53.602 --> 00:02:55.720
and those Newtonian laws

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.519
that we so dearly cherished

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.716
turned out to be just local ordinances,

00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:01.467
and what we found was that in this

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:04.080
completely unpredictable world

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.112
that most of the people who were surviving

00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:09.445
were working with sort of a different set of principles,

00:03:09.445 --> 00:03:12.076
and I want to talk a little bit about that.

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:13.440
Before the Internet, if you remember,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.345
when we tried to create services,

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:16.371
what you would do is you'd create

00:03:16.371 --> 00:03:18.683
the hardware layer and the
network layer and the software

00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:20.711
and it would cost millions of dollars

00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.018
to do anything that was substantial.

00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:25.457
So when it costs millions of dollars
to do something substantial,

00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:27.529
what you would do is you'd get an MBA

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:28.987
who would write a plan

00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:29.930
and get the money

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.674
from V.C.s or big companies,

00:03:31.674 --> 00:03:33.787
and then you'd hire the designers and the engineers,

00:03:33.787 --> 00:03:34.810
and they'd build the thing.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.429
This is the Before Internet, B.I., innovation model.

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:41.736
What happened after the Internet was

00:03:41.736 --> 00:03:43.492
the cost of innovation went down so much

00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:45.979
because the cost of collaboration,
the cost of distribution,

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.622
the cost of communication, and Moore's Law

00:03:48.622 --> 00:03:51.298
made it so that the cost of trying a new thing

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:52.692
became nearly zero,

00:03:52.692 --> 00:03:54.961
and so you would have Google, Facebook, Yahoo,

00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:56.732
students that didn't have permission —

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:58.105
permissionless innovation —

00:03:58.105 --> 00:03:59.725
didn't have permission, didn't have PowerPoints,

00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:01.828
they just built the thing,

00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:03.272
then they raised the money,

00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:05.473
and then they sort of figured out a business plan

00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:07.830
and maybe later on they hired some MBAs.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.141
So the Internet caused innovation,

00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:11.265
at least in software and services,

00:04:11.265 --> 00:04:14.124
to go from an MBA-driven innovation model

00:04:14.124 --> 00:04:18.027
to a designer-engineer-driven innovation model,

00:04:18.027 --> 00:04:20.125
and it pushed innovation to the edges,

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:21.671
to the dorm rooms, to the startups,

00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:23.357
away from the large institutions,

00:04:23.357 --> 00:04:25.712
the stodgy old institutions that had the power

00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:27.399
and the money and the authority.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:30.008
And we all know this. We all know
this happened on the Internet.

00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:32.773
It turns out it's happening in other things, too.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:36.015
Let me give you some examples.

00:04:36.015 --> 00:04:38.800
So at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.842
We do all kinds of things.

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:41.727
We do biology, we do hardware,

00:04:41.727 --> 00:04:45.348
and Nicholas Negroponte
famously said, "Demo or die,"

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:47.070
as opposed to "Publish or perish,"

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.313
which was the traditional academic way of thinking.

00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:52.875
And he often said, the demo only has to work once,

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.691
because the primary mode of us impacting the world

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:57.469
was through large companies

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:58.732
being inspired by us

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:02.248
and creating products like
the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms.

00:05:02.248 --> 00:05:04.190
But today, with the ability

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.499
to deploy things into the real world at such low cost,

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:08.649
I'm changing the motto now,

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:10.462
and this is the official public statement.

00:05:10.462 --> 00:05:12.959
I'm officially saying, "Deploy or die."

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:15.180
You have to get the stuff into the real world

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.536
for it to really count,

00:05:16.536 --> 00:05:18.415
and sometimes it will be large companies,

00:05:18.415 --> 00:05:20.372
and Nicholas can talk about satellites.

00:05:20.372 --> 00:05:21.658
(Applause)

00:05:21.658 --> 00:05:22.740
Thank you.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.514
But we should be getting out there ourselves

00:05:24.514 --> 00:05:28.098
and not depending on large
institutions to do it for us.

00:05:28.098 --> 00:05:30.800
So last year, we sent a bunch
of students to Shenzhen,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.380
and they sat on the factory floors

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.685
with the innovators in Shenzhen, and it was amazing.

00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:36.162
What was happening there

00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:38.346
was you would have these manufacturing devices,

00:05:38.346 --> 00:05:40.539
and they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints.

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.004
They were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment

00:05:43.004 --> 00:05:46.214
and innovating right on the
manufacturing equipment.

00:05:46.214 --> 00:05:48.100
The factory was in the designer,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.374
and the designer was literally in the factory.

00:05:50.374 --> 00:05:52.000
And so what you would do is,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.241
you'd go down to the stalls

00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:55.797
and you would see these cell phones.

00:05:55.797 --> 00:05:58.322
So instead of starting little websites

00:05:58.322 --> 00:05:59.870
like the kids in Palo Alto do,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.410
the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.107
They make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto

00:06:05.107 --> 00:06:06.365
make websites,

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.478
and so there's a rainforest

00:06:08.478 --> 00:06:10.034
of innovation going on in the cell phone.

00:06:10.034 --> 00:06:11.634
What they do is, they make a cell phone,

00:06:11.634 --> 00:06:13.858
go down to the stall, they sell some,

00:06:13.858 --> 00:06:16.183
they look at the other kids' stuff, go up,

00:06:16.183 --> 00:06:18.774
make a couple thousand more, go down.

00:06:18.774 --> 00:06:20.765
Doesn't this sound like a software thing?

00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:22.412
It sounds like agile software development,

00:06:22.412 --> 00:06:25.340
A/B testing and iteration,

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.423
and what we thought you could only do with software

00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:29.693
kids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware.

00:06:29.693 --> 00:06:31.160
My next fellow, I hope, is going to be

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.645
one of these innovators from Shenzhen.

00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:34.310
And so what you see is

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.279
that is pushing innovation to the edges.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.384
We talk about 3D printers and stuff like that,

00:06:38.384 --> 00:06:40.375
and that's great, but this is Limor.

00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.634
She is one of our favorite graduates,

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:44.710
and she is standing in front of a Samsung

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.543
Techwin Pick and Place Machine.

00:06:46.543 --> 00:06:50.467
This thing can put 23,000 components per hour

00:06:50.467 --> 00:06:52.460
onto an electronics board.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.283
This is a factory in a box.

00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:56.781
So what used to take a factory full of workers

00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:57.800
working by hand

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.509
in this little box in New York,

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:00.559
she's able to have effectively —

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:02.192
She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen

00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:03.436
to do this manufacturing.

00:07:03.436 --> 00:07:05.697
She can buy this box and she can manufacture it.

00:07:05.697 --> 00:07:07.940
So manufacturing, the cost of innovation,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.630
the cost of prototyping, distribution,
manufacturing, hardware,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.093
is getting so low

00:07:12.093 --> 00:07:14.410
that innovation is being pushed to the edges

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.838
and students and startups are being able to build it.

00:07:16.838 --> 00:07:18.716
This is a recent thing, but this will happen

00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:20.199
and this will change

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:22.624
just like it did with software.

00:07:22.624 --> 00:07:25.870
Sorona is a DuPont process

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.890
that uses a genetically engineered microbe

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.840
to turn corn sugar into polyester.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.318
It's 30 percent more efficient
than the fossil fuel method,

00:07:35.318 --> 00:07:38.977
and it's much better for the environment.

00:07:38.977 --> 00:07:40.382
Genetic engineering and bioengineering

00:07:40.382 --> 00:07:41.913
are creating a whole bunch

00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:43.671
of great new opportunities

00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.500
for chemistry, for computation, for memory.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.550
We will probably be doing a lot,
obviously doing health things,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.754
but we will probably be growing chairs

00:07:50.754 --> 00:07:51.794
and buildings soon.

00:07:51.794 --> 00:07:55.704
The problem is, Sorona costs
about 400 million dollars

00:07:55.704 --> 00:07:57.085
and took seven years to build.

00:07:57.085 --> 00:08:00.164
It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days.

00:08:00.164 --> 00:08:02.656
The thing is, the cost of innovation

00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.242
in bioengineering is also going down.

00:08:04.242 --> 00:08:06.211
This is desktop gene sequencer.

00:08:06.211 --> 00:08:09.765
It used to cost millions and millions
of dollars to sequence genes.

00:08:09.765 --> 00:08:11.509
Now you can do it on a desktop like this,

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:13.602
and kids can do this in dorm rooms.

00:08:13.602 --> 00:08:16.290
This is Gen9 gene assembler,

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.369
and so right now when you try to print a gene,

00:08:18.369 --> 00:08:19.637
what you do is somebody in a factory

00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:21.577
with pipettes puts the thing together by hand,

00:08:21.577 --> 00:08:23.928
you have one error per 100 base pairs,

00:08:23.928 --> 00:08:26.504
and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money.

00:08:26.504 --> 00:08:27.890
This new device

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.564
assembles genes on a chip,

00:08:29.564 --> 00:08:31.713
and instead of one error per 100 base pairs,

00:08:31.713 --> 00:08:33.839
it's one error per 10,000 base pairs.

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:36.584
In this lab, we will have the world's capacity

00:08:36.584 --> 00:08:38.687
of gene printing within a year,

00:08:38.687 --> 00:08:41.299
200 million base pairs a year.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.862
This is kind of like when we went

00:08:43.862 --> 00:08:46.123
from transistor radios wrapped by hand

00:08:46.123 --> 00:08:47.394
to the Pentium.

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:49.790
This is going to become the
Pentium of bioengineering,

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.826
pushing bioengineering into the hands

00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:54.427
of dorm rooms and startup companies.

00:08:54.427 --> 00:08:57.200
So it's happening in software and in hardware

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.163
and bioengineering,

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:01.444
and so this is a fundamental new
way of thinking about innovation.

00:09:01.444 --> 00:09:04.121
It's a bottom-up innovation, it's democratic,

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:06.325
it's chaotic, it's hard to control.

00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:08.632
It's not bad, but it's very different,

00:09:08.632 --> 00:09:10.599
and I think that the traditional rules that we have

00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:12.671
for institutions don't work anymore,

00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:14.350
and most of us here

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.433
operate with a different set of principles.

00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:20.269
One of my favorite principles is the power of pull,

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:22.560
which is the idea of pulling resources

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.326
from the network as you need them

00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:26.171
rather than stocking them in the center

00:09:26.171 --> 00:09:27.756
and controlling everything.

00:09:27.756 --> 00:09:30.520
So in the case of the Safecast story,

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.362
I didn't know anything when
the earthquake happened,

00:09:32.362 --> 00:09:33.990
but I was able to find Sean

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.186
who was the hackerspace community organizer,

00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:37.972
and Peter, the analog hardware hacker

00:09:37.972 --> 00:09:39.688
who made our first Geiger counter,

00:09:39.688 --> 00:09:41.686
and Dan, who built the Three Mile Island

00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:45.020
monitoring system after the
Three Mile Island meltdown.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.406
And these people I wouldn't have been able to find

00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:49.840
beforehand and probably were better

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.967
that I found them just in time from the network.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.834
I'm a three-time college dropout,

00:09:54.834 --> 00:09:56.507
so learning over education

00:09:56.507 --> 00:09:57.932
is very near and dear to my heart,

00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:00.456
but to me, education is what people do to you

00:10:00.456 --> 00:10:03.455
and learning is what you do to yourself.

00:10:03.455 --> 00:10:07.231
(Applause)

00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:08.990
And it feels like, and I'm biased,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.787
it feels like they're trying to make you memorize

00:10:11.787 --> 00:10:14.901
the whole encyclopedia before
they let you go out and play,

00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:18.998
and to me, I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone,

00:10:18.998 --> 00:10:20.701
and it feels like they assume

00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:22.488
you're going to be on top of some mountain

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:24.949
all by yourself with a number 2 pencil

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:26.332
trying to figure out what to do

00:10:26.332 --> 00:10:28.448
when in fact you're always going to be connected,

00:10:28.448 --> 00:10:30.093
you're always going to have friends,

00:10:30.093 --> 00:10:32.052
and you can pull Wikipedia
up whenever you need it,

00:10:32.052 --> 00:10:35.500
and what you need to learn is how to learn.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.144
In the case of Safecast, a bunch of amateurs

00:10:38.144 --> 00:10:39.742
when we started three years ago,

00:10:39.742 --> 00:10:42.250
I would argue that we probably as a group

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.666
know more than any other organization

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:47.875
about how to collect data and publish data

00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:50.647
and do citizen science.

00:10:50.647 --> 00:10:51.767
Compass over maps.

00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:55.492
So this one, the idea is that the cost of writing a plan

00:10:55.492 --> 00:10:58.595
or mapping something is getting so expensive

00:10:58.595 --> 00:11:01.768
and it's not very accurate or useful.

00:11:01.768 --> 00:11:04.880
So in the Safecast story, we
knew we needed to collect data,

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.303
we knew we wanted to publish the data,

00:11:07.303 --> 00:11:10.192
and instead of trying to come up with the exact plan,

00:11:10.192 --> 00:11:12.600
we first said, oh, let's get Geiger counters.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.366
Oh, they've run out.

00:11:14.366 --> 00:11:16.369
Let's build them. There aren't enough sensors.

00:11:16.369 --> 00:11:18.596
Okay, then we can make a mobile Geiger counter.

00:11:18.596 --> 00:11:20.643
We can drive around. We can get volunteers.

00:11:20.643 --> 00:11:22.522
We don't have enough money. Let's Kickstarter it.

00:11:22.522 --> 00:11:24.513
We could not have planned this whole thing,

00:11:24.513 --> 00:11:26.257
but by having a very strong compass,

00:11:26.257 --> 00:11:27.692
we eventually got to where we were going,

00:11:27.692 --> 00:11:30.110
and to me it's very similar to
agile software development,

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.468
but this idea of compasses is very important.

00:11:33.468 --> 00:11:35.409
So I think the good news is

00:11:35.409 --> 00:11:38.910
that even though the world is extremely complex,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.302
what you need to do is very simple.

00:11:41.302 --> 00:11:44.000
I think it's about stopping this notion

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.572
that you need to plan everything,

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:46.664
you need to stock everything,

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.134
and you need to be so prepared,

00:11:48.134 --> 00:11:51.128
and focus on being connected,

00:11:51.128 --> 00:11:52.979
always learning,

00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:54.840
fully aware,

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.620
and super present.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.566
So I don't like the word "futurist."

00:11:59.566 --> 00:12:05.181
I think we should be now-ists,

00:12:05.181 --> 00:12:07.227
like we are right now.

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.070
Thank you.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:13.049
(Applause)
