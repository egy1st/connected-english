00:00:00.621 --> 00:00:01.993
Could I protect my father

00:00:01.993 --> 00:00:05.168
from the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife?

00:00:05.168 --> 00:00:06.729
That was the question I faced

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.497
one Tuesday morning in June of 1993,

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:11.339
when I was a law student.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.277
I woke up early that morning

00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:14.397
in Dad's apartment

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:16.695
on the outskirts of Algiers, Algeria,

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:19.969
to an unrelenting pounding on the front door.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:22.729
It was a season as described by a local paper

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:25.585
when every Tuesday a scholar fell

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:28.768
to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins.

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:31.130
My father's university teaching of Darwin

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.130
had already provoked a classroom visit

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.601
from the head of the so-called
Islamic Salvation Front,

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:39.657
who denounced Dad as an advocate of biologism

00:00:39.657 --> 00:00:42.323
before Dad had ejected the man,

00:00:42.323 --> 00:00:43.810
and now whoever was outside

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.910
would neither identify himself nor go away.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.882
So my father tried to get the police on the phone,

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.980
but perhaps terrified by the rising tide

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.404
of armed extremism that had already claimed

00:00:54.404 --> 00:00:56.937
the lives of so many Algerian officers,

00:00:56.937 --> 00:00:59.063
they didn't even answer.

00:00:59.063 --> 00:01:01.402
And that was when I went to the kitchen,

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:02.777
got out a paring knife,

00:01:02.777 --> 00:01:05.755
and took up a position inside the entryway.

00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:07.302
It was a ridiculous thing to do, really,

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:09.151
but I couldn't think of anything else,

00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.740
and so there I stood.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.247
When I look back now, I think
that that was the moment

00:01:14.247 --> 00:01:16.761
that set me on the path was to writing a book

00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:19.413
called "Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here:

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:23.450
Untold Stories from the Fight
Against Muslim Fundamentalism."

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.416
The title comes from a Pakistani play.

00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:29.266
I think it was actually that moment

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.010
that sent me on the journey

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.960
to interview 300 people of Muslim heritage

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.494
from nearly 30 countries,

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:37.910
from Afghanistan to Mali,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.251
to find out how they fought fundamentalism

00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:42.479
peacefully like my father did,

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.214
and how they coped with the attendant risks.

00:01:46.214 --> 00:01:48.431
Luckily, back in June of 1993,

00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:51.263
our unidentified visitor went away,

00:01:51.263 --> 00:01:54.308
but other families were so much less lucky,

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:58.161
and that was the thought
that motivated my research.

00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:59.691
In any case, someone would return

00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:01.275
a few months later and leave a note

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:02.727
on Dad's kitchen table,

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:06.857
which simply said, "Consider yourself dead."

00:02:06.857 --> 00:02:09.845
Subsequently, Algeria's
fundamentalist armed groups

00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:12.908
would murder as many as 200,000 civilians

00:02:12.908 --> 00:02:14.260
in what came to be known

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.138
as the dark decade of the 1990s,

00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:19.010
including every single one

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.257
of the women that you see here.

00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:25.130
In its harsh counterterrorist response,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.127
the state resorted to torture

00:02:27.127 --> 00:02:28.838
and to forced disappearances,

00:02:28.838 --> 00:02:32.200
and as terrible as all of these events became,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.835
the international community largely ignored them.

00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:39.558
Finally, my father, an Algerian
peasant's son turned professor,

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:41.661
was forced to stop teaching at the university

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.850
and to flee his apartment,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.223
but what I will never forget

00:02:45.223 --> 00:02:47.458
about Mahfoud Bennoune, my dad,

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:50.167
was that like so many other Algerian intellectuals,

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:51.941
he refused to leave the country

00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:54.999
and he continued to publish pointed criticisms,

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.949
both of the fundamentalists

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.919
and sometimes of the government they battled.

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.041
For example, in a November 1994 series

00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.195
in the newspaper El Watan

00:03:05.195 --> 00:03:06.704
entitled "How Fundamentalism

00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:10.246
Produced a Terrorism without Precedent,"

00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:11.483
he denounced what he called

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:14.816
the terrorists' radical break with the true Islam

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:17.684
as it was lived by our ancestors.

00:03:17.684 --> 00:03:20.515
These were words that could get you killed.

00:03:20.515 --> 00:03:21.992
My father's country taught me

00:03:21.992 --> 00:03:24.546
in that dark decade of the 1990s that

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:27.954
the popular struggle against Muslim fundamentalism

00:03:27.954 --> 00:03:29.642
is one of the most important

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:32.173
and overlooked human rights struggles

00:03:32.173 --> 00:03:33.928
in the world.

00:03:33.928 --> 00:03:37.539
This remains true today, nearly 20 years later.

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.120
You see, in every country

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.970
where you hear about armed jihadis

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.726
targeting civilians,

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:44.401
there are also unarmed people

00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:47.248
defying those militants that you don't hear about,

00:03:47.248 --> 00:03:51.830
and those people need our support to succeed.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.648
In the West, it's often assumed

00:03:53.648 --> 00:03:56.685
that Muslims generally condone terrorism.

00:03:56.685 --> 00:03:58.687
Some on the right think this because they view

00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:00.950
Muslim culture as inherently violent,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.535
and some on the left imagine this

00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:04.323
because they view Muslim violence,

00:04:04.323 --> 00:04:05.674
fundamentalist violence,

00:04:05.674 --> 00:04:09.307
solely as a product of legitimate grievances.

00:04:09.307 --> 00:04:11.804
But both views are dead wrong.

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:13.619
In fact, many people of Muslim heritage

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.383
around the world are staunch opponents

00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:19.644
both of fundamentalism and of terrorism,

00:04:19.644 --> 00:04:22.110
and often for very good reason.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.150
You see, they're much more likely to be victims

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.305
of this violence than its perpetrators.

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:29.322
Let me just give you one example.

00:04:29.322 --> 00:04:32.165
According to a 2009 survey

00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:34.505
of Arabic language media resources,

00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:37.756
between 2004 and 2008,

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:40.880
no more than 15 percent of al Qaeda's victims

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.461
were Westerners.

00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:45.406
That's a terrible toll, but the vast majority

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:47.175
were people of Muslim heritage,

00:04:47.175 --> 00:04:49.991
killed by Muslim fundamentalists.

00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:52.819
Now I've been talking for the last five minutes

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.302
about fundamentalism, and you have a right to know

00:04:55.302 --> 00:04:56.996
exactly what I mean.

00:04:56.996 --> 00:05:00.901
I cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.940
Marieme Helie Lucas,

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.336
and she says that fundamentalisms,

00:05:05.336 --> 00:05:07.834
note the "s," so within all of the world's

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:09.656
great religious traditions,

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:13.627
"fundamentalisms are political
movements of the extreme right

00:05:13.627 --> 00:05:15.790
which in a context of globalization

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.284
manipulate religion in order to achieve

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:19.933
their political aims."

00:05:19.933 --> 00:05:23.616
Sadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization

00:05:23.616 --> 00:05:25.127
of theology.

00:05:25.127 --> 00:05:27.542
Now I want to avoid projecting the notion

00:05:27.542 --> 00:05:29.328
that there's sort of a monolith out there

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:32.541
called Muslim fundamentalism
that is the same everywhere,

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:35.257
because these movements
also have their diversities.

00:05:35.257 --> 00:05:37.720
Some use and advocate violence.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.350
Some do not, though they're often interrelated.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.920
They take different forms.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.544
Some may be non-governmental organizations,

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:47.076
even here in Britain like Cageprisoners.

00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:49.169
Some may become political parties,

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.740
like the Muslim Brotherhood,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.458
and some may be openly armed groups

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:54.183
like the Taliban.

00:05:54.183 --> 00:05:57.504
But in any case, these are all radical projects.

00:05:57.504 --> 00:06:00.733
They're not conservative or traditional approaches.

00:06:00.733 --> 00:06:03.946
They're most often about changing
people's relationship with Islam

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:05.501
rather than preserving it.

00:06:05.501 --> 00:06:08.891
What I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right,

00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:10.890
and the fact that its adherents are

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.730
or purport to be Muslim

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.140
makes them no less offensive

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.631
than the extreme right anywhere else.

00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:18.498
So in my view, if we consider ourselves

00:06:18.498 --> 00:06:20.248
liberal or left-wing,

00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:22.708
human rights-loving or feminist,

00:06:22.708 --> 00:06:24.909
we must oppose these movements

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.754
and support their grassroots opponents.

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:29.370
Now let me be clear

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.372
that I support an effective struggle

00:06:31.372 --> 00:06:33.317
against fundamentalism,

00:06:33.317 --> 00:06:35.597
but also a struggle that must itself

00:06:35.597 --> 00:06:37.535
respect international law,

00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:39.964
so nothing I am saying should be taken

00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:41.809
as a justification for refusals

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:43.274
to democratize,

00:06:43.274 --> 00:06:45.949
and here I send out a shout-out of support

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.000
to the pro-democracy movement 
in Algeria today, Barakat.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.282
Nor should anything I say be taken

00:06:52.282 --> 00:06:55.149
as a justification of violations of human rights,

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:56.555
like the mass death sentences

00:06:56.555 --> 00:06:59.475
handed out in Egypt earlier this week.

00:06:59.475 --> 00:07:00.998
But what I am saying

00:07:00.998 --> 00:07:04.305
is that we must challenge these
Muslim fundamentalist movements

00:07:04.305 --> 00:07:06.123
because they threaten human rights

00:07:06.123 --> 00:07:08.706
across Muslim-majority contexts,

00:07:08.706 --> 00:07:11.087
and they do this in a range of ways,

00:07:11.087 --> 00:07:14.050
most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.289
by the armed groups that carry those out.

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:19.336
But that violence is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:22.127
These movements as a whole purvey discrimination

00:07:22.127 --> 00:07:25.448
against religious minorities and sexual minorities.

00:07:25.448 --> 00:07:27.528
They seek to curtail the freedom of religion

00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:30.427
of everyone who either practices in a different way

00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:32.391
or chooses not to practice.

00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:35.815
And most definingly, they lead an all-out war

00:07:35.815 --> 00:07:37.896
on the rights of women.

00:07:37.896 --> 00:07:39.692
Now, faced with these movements

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.264
in recent years, Western discourse

00:07:41.264 --> 00:07:42.899
has most often offered

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:45.156
two flawed responses.

00:07:45.156 --> 00:07:47.719
The first that one sometimes finds on the right

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:50.261
suggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.607
or something about Islam is
inherently fundamentalist,

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:56.898
and this is just offensive and wrong,

00:07:56.898 --> 00:07:59.306
but unfortunately on the left
one sometimes encounters

00:07:59.306 --> 00:08:01.488
a discourse that is too politically correct

00:08:01.488 --> 00:08:05.290
to acknowledge the problem of
Muslim fundamentalism at all

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.651
or, even worse, apologizes for it,

00:08:07.651 --> 00:08:10.199
and this is unacceptable as well.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:12.261
So what I'm seeking is a new way

00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.382
of talking about this all together,

00:08:14.382 --> 00:08:17.110
which is grounded in the lived experiences

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.059
and the hope of the people on the front lines.

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:22.010
I'm painfully aware that there has been

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.191
an increase in discrimination
against Muslims in recent years

00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:27.662
in countries like the U.K. and the U.S.,

00:08:27.662 --> 00:08:30.716
and that too is a matter of grave concern,

00:08:30.716 --> 00:08:31.855
but I firmly believe

00:08:31.855 --> 00:08:34.816
that telling these counter-stereotypical stories

00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:36.142
of people of Muslim heritage

00:08:36.142 --> 00:08:38.314
who have confronted the fundamentalists

00:08:38.314 --> 00:08:40.329
and been their primary victims

00:08:40.329 --> 00:08:44.906
is also a great way of countering that discrimination.

00:08:44.906 --> 00:08:46.686
So now let me introduce you

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:48.342
to four people whose stories

00:08:48.342 --> 00:08:51.558
I had the great honor of telling.

00:08:51.558 --> 00:08:53.791
Faizan Peerzada and the Rafi Peer Theatre

00:08:53.791 --> 00:08:55.793
workshop named for his father

00:08:55.793 --> 00:08:57.931
have for years promoted the performing arts

00:08:57.931 --> 00:08:59.663
in Pakistan.

00:08:59.663 --> 00:09:01.124
With the rise of jihadist violence,

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.700
they began to receive threats

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.950
to call off their events, which they refused to heed.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.220
And so a bomber struck their 2008

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.104
eighth world performing arts festival in Lahore,

00:09:12.104 --> 00:09:13.792
producing rain of glass

00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:15.457
that fell into the venue

00:09:15.457 --> 00:09:17.392
injuring nine people,

00:09:17.392 --> 00:09:18.960
and later that same night,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.711
the Peerzadas made a very difficult decision:

00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:23.580
they announced that their festival

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.987
would continue as planned the next day.

00:09:26.987 --> 00:09:28.438
As Faizan said at the time,

00:09:28.438 --> 00:09:30.380
if we bow down to the Islamists,

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.491
we'll just be sitting in a dark corner.

00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:35.149
But they didn't know what would happen.

00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:37.586
Would anyone come?

00:09:37.586 --> 00:09:40.475
In fact, thousands of people came out the next day

00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:42.877
to support the performing arts in Lahore,

00:09:42.877 --> 00:09:44.722
and this simultaneously thrilled

00:09:44.722 --> 00:09:46.544
and terrified Faizan,

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:47.997
and he ran up to a woman

00:09:47.997 --> 00:09:50.214
who had come in with her two small children,

00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:53.408
and he said, "You do know there
was a bomb here yesterday,

00:09:53.408 --> 00:09:55.735
and you do know there's a threat here today."

00:09:55.735 --> 00:09:57.618
And she said, "I know that,

00:09:57.618 --> 00:09:59.182
but I came to your festival

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.612
with my mother when I was their age,

00:10:01.612 --> 00:10:04.660
and I still have those images in my mind.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.798
We have to be here."

00:10:06.798 --> 00:10:08.655
With stalwart audiences like this,

00:10:08.655 --> 00:10:10.309
the Peerzadas were able to conclude

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.769
their festival on schedule.

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:14.006
And then the next year,

00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:15.889
they lost all of their sponsors

00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:18.258
due to the security risk.

00:10:18.258 --> 00:10:20.558
So when I met them in 2010,

00:10:20.558 --> 00:10:22.844
they were in the middle of the first subsequent event

00:10:22.844 --> 00:10:25.910
that they were able to have in the same venue,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.174
and this was the ninth youth performing arts festival

00:10:29.174 --> 00:10:32.149
held in Lahore in a year when that city

00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:36.219
had already experienced 44 terror attacks.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.322
This was a time when the Pakistani Taliban

00:10:38.322 --> 00:10:40.139
had commenced their systematic targeting

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.347
of girls' schools that would culminate

00:10:42.347 --> 00:10:45.106
in the attack on Malala Yousafzai.

00:10:45.106 --> 00:10:49.501
What did the Peerzadas do in that environment?

00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:52.674
They staged girls' school theater.

00:10:52.674 --> 00:10:55.486
So I had the privilege of watching "Naang Wal,"

00:10:55.486 --> 00:10:58.118
which was a musical in the Punjabi language,

00:10:58.118 --> 00:10:59.880
and the girls of Lahore Grammar School

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.606
played all the parts.

00:11:01.606 --> 00:11:02.840
They sang and danced,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.498
they played the mice and the water buffalo,

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.962
and I held my breath, wondering,

00:11:07.962 --> 00:11:09.229
would we get to the end

00:11:09.229 --> 00:11:11.515
of this amazing show?

00:11:11.515 --> 00:11:14.071
And when we did, the whole audience

00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:15.809
collectively exhaled,

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:18.073
and a few people actually wept,

00:11:18.073 --> 00:11:20.596
and then they filled the auditorium

00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:23.435
with the peaceful boom of their applause.

00:11:23.435 --> 00:11:26.422
And I remember thinking in that moment

00:11:26.422 --> 00:11:28.853
that the bombers made headlines here

00:11:28.853 --> 00:11:30.516
two years before

00:11:30.516 --> 00:11:32.880
but this night and these people

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.171
are as important a story.

00:11:38.488 --> 00:11:40.968
Maria Bashir is the first and only

00:11:40.968 --> 00:11:44.092
woman chief prosecutor in Afghanistan.

00:11:44.092 --> 00:11:46.306
She's been in the post since 2008

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:48.492
and actually opened an office to investigate

00:11:48.492 --> 00:11:50.318
cases of violence against women,

00:11:50.318 --> 00:11:52.576
which she says is the most important area

00:11:52.576 --> 00:11:54.310
in her mandate.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.375
When I meet her in her office in Herat,

00:11:57.375 --> 00:11:59.120
she enters surrounded by

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.486
four large men with four huge guns.

00:12:02.486 --> 00:12:05.450
In fact, she now has 23 bodyguards,

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.870
because she has weathered bomb attacks

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.548
that nearly killed her kids,

00:12:08.548 --> 00:12:11.899
and it took the leg off of one of her guards.

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:14.009
Why does she continue?

00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:16.663
She says with a smile that that is the question

00:12:16.663 --> 00:12:18.710
that everyone asks—

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.535
as she puts it, "Why you risk not living?"

00:12:22.535 --> 00:12:24.174
And it is simply that for her,

00:12:24.174 --> 00:12:27.643
a better future for all the Maria Bashirs to come

00:12:27.643 --> 00:12:29.127
is worth the risk,

00:12:29.127 --> 00:12:30.837
and she knows that if people like her

00:12:30.837 --> 00:12:32.752
do not take the risk,

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.049
there will be no better future.

00:12:35.049 --> 00:12:36.776
Later on in our interview,

00:12:36.776 --> 00:12:39.139
Prosecutor Bashir tells me how worried she is

00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:40.658
about the possible outcome

00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:43.157
of government negotiations with the Taliban,

00:12:43.157 --> 00:12:45.551
the people who have been trying to kill her.

00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:47.303
"If we give them a place in the government,"

00:12:47.303 --> 00:12:50.520
she asks, "Who will protect women's rights?"

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.886
And she urges the international community

00:12:52.886 --> 00:12:55.518
not to forget its promise about women

00:12:55.518 --> 00:12:59.345
because now they want peace with Taliban.

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:01.550
A few weeks after I leave Afghanistan,

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.425
I see a headline on the Internet.

00:13:04.425 --> 00:13:08.030
An Afghan prosecutor has been assassinated.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.166
I google desperately,

00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:11.840
and thankfully that day I find out

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.926
that Maria was not the victim,

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:16.149
though sadly, another Afghan prosecutor

00:13:16.149 --> 00:13:18.180
was gunned down on his way to work.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.175
And when I hear headlines like that now,

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:23.473
I think that as international troops

00:13:23.473 --> 00:13:26.521
leave Afghanistan this year and beyond,

00:13:26.521 --> 00:13:28.427
we must continue to care

00:13:28.427 --> 00:13:29.860
about what happens to people there,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.886
to all of the Maria Bashirs.

00:13:32.886 --> 00:13:35.499
Sometimes I still hear her voice in my head

00:13:35.499 --> 00:13:38.580
saying, with no bravado whatsoever,

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.185
"The situation of the women of Afghanistan

00:13:41.185 --> 00:13:43.091
will be better someday.

00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:45.326
We should prepare the ground for this,

00:13:45.326 --> 00:13:48.269
even if we are killed."

00:13:49.854 --> 00:13:51.502
There are no words adequate

00:13:51.502 --> 00:13:53.478
to denounce the al Shabaab terrorists

00:13:53.478 --> 00:13:55.740
who attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.202
on the same day as a children's cooking competition

00:13:59.202 --> 00:14:01.620
in September of 2013.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.119
They killed 67, including poets and pregnant women.

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:08.218
Far away in the American Midwest,

00:14:08.218 --> 00:14:10.565
I had the good fortune of meeting Somali-Americans

00:14:10.565 --> 00:14:13.413
who were working to counter
the efforts of al Shabaab

00:14:13.413 --> 00:14:15.637
to recruit a small number of young people

00:14:15.637 --> 00:14:17.581
from their city of Minneapolis

00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:21.279
to take part in atrocities like Westgate.

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:23.239
Abdirizak Bihi's studious

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:26.128
17-year-old nephew Burhan Hassan

00:14:26.128 --> 00:14:28.776
was recruited here in 2008,

00:14:28.776 --> 00:14:30.536
spirited to Somalia,

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:33.906
and then killed when he tried to come home.

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:35.500
Since that time, Mr. Bihi,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.753
who directs the no-budget Somali
Education and Advocacy Center,

00:14:39.753 --> 00:14:42.204
has been vocally denouncing the recruitment

00:14:42.204 --> 00:14:44.060
and the failures of government

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.279
and Somali-American institutions

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:49.304
like the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center

00:14:49.304 --> 00:14:51.535
where he believes his nephew was radicalized

00:14:51.535 --> 00:14:53.641
during a youth program.

00:14:53.641 --> 00:14:55.794
But he doesn't just criticize the mosque.

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.373
He also takes on the government

00:14:57.373 --> 00:14:59.158
for its failure to do more

00:14:59.158 --> 00:15:01.656
to prevent poverty in his community.

00:15:01.656 --> 00:15:03.945
Given his own lack of financial resources,

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.256
Mr. Bihi has had to be creative.

00:15:06.256 --> 00:15:08.150
To counter the efforts of al Shabaab

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.535
to sway more disaffected youth,

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.970
in the wake of the group's 2010 attack

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.564
on World Cup viewers in Uganda,

00:15:15.564 --> 00:15:18.904
he organized a Ramadan basketball tournament

00:15:18.904 --> 00:15:21.436
in Minneapolis in response.

00:15:21.436 --> 00:15:24.120
Scores of Somali-American kids came out

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.508
to embrace sport

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.000
despite the fatwa against it.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.745
They played basketball

00:15:29.745 --> 00:15:33.612
as Burhan Hassan never would again.

00:15:33.612 --> 00:15:36.262
For his efforts, Mr. Bihi has been ostracized

00:15:36.262 --> 00:15:39.334
by the leadership of the Abubakar
As-Saddique Islamic Center,

00:15:39.334 --> 00:15:41.899
with which he used to have good relations.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:44.285
He told me, "One day we saw the imam on TV

00:15:44.285 --> 00:15:46.343
calling us infidels and saying,

00:15:46.343 --> 00:15:49.912
'These families are trying to destroy the mosque.'"

00:15:49.912 --> 00:15:51.323
This is at complete odds

00:15:51.323 --> 00:15:53.856
with how Abdirizak Bihi understands

00:15:53.856 --> 00:15:55.656
what he is trying to do

00:15:55.656 --> 00:15:58.062
by exposing al Shabaab recruitment,

00:15:58.062 --> 00:16:00.484
which is to save the religion I love

00:16:00.484 --> 00:16:03.610
from a small number of extremists.

00:16:04.938 --> 00:16:07.499
Now I want to tell one last story,

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:10.513
that of a 22-year-old law student in Algeria

00:16:10.513 --> 00:16:12.459
named Amel Zenoune-Zouani

00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:14.338
who had the same dreams of a legal career

00:16:14.338 --> 00:16:17.040
that I did back in the '90s.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.969
She refused to give up her studies,

00:16:18.969 --> 00:16:20.938
despite the fact that the fundamentalists

00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:23.468
battling the Algerian state back then

00:16:23.468 --> 00:16:27.090
threatened all who continued their education.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.200
On January 26, 1997, Amel boarded the bus

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.122
in Algiers where she was studying

00:16:33.122 --> 00:16:35.305
to go home and spend a Ramadan evening

00:16:35.305 --> 00:16:36.994
with her family,

00:16:36.994 --> 00:16:39.380
and would never finish law school.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.840
When the bus reached the outskirts

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.615
of her hometown, it was stopped

00:16:42.615 --> 00:16:44.757
at a checkpoint manned by men

00:16:44.757 --> 00:16:47.051
from the Armed Islamic Group.

00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:48.780
Carrying her schoolbag,

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.766
Amel was taken off the bus

00:16:50.766 --> 00:16:53.355
and killed in the street.

00:16:53.355 --> 00:16:54.491
The men who cut her throat

00:16:54.491 --> 00:16:56.341
then told everyone else,

00:16:56.341 --> 00:16:58.235
"If you go to university,

00:16:58.235 --> 00:17:00.789
the day will come when we will kill all of you

00:17:00.789 --> 00:17:04.020
just like this."

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.720
Amel died at exactly 5:17 p.m.,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.568
which we know because when she fell in the street,

00:17:09.568 --> 00:17:11.345
her watch broke.

00:17:11.345 --> 00:17:12.574
Her mother showed me the watch

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:14.575
with the second hand still aimed

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:16.071
optimistically upward

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:19.507
towards a 5:18 that would never come.

00:17:19.507 --> 00:17:20.656
Shortly before her death,

00:17:20.656 --> 00:17:22.511
Amel had said to her mother of herself

00:17:22.511 --> 00:17:24.398
and her sisters,

00:17:24.398 --> 00:17:28.015
"Nothing will happen to us, Inshallah, God willing,

00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:29.885
but if something happens,

00:17:29.885 --> 00:17:32.768
you must know that we are dead for knowledge.

00:17:32.768 --> 00:17:36.978
You and father must keep your heads held high."

00:17:36.978 --> 00:17:40.960
The loss of such a young woman is unfathomable,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.515
and so as I did my research

00:17:42.515 --> 00:17:45.769
I found myself searching for Amel's hope again

00:17:45.769 --> 00:17:48.706
and her name even means "hope" in Arabic.

00:17:48.706 --> 00:17:51.957
I think I found it in two places.

00:17:51.957 --> 00:17:54.252
The first is in the strength of her family

00:17:54.252 --> 00:17:57.518
and all the other families to
continue telling their stories

00:17:57.518 --> 00:18:00.583
and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism.

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:03.865
In fact, Amel's sister Lamia overcame her grief,

00:18:03.865 --> 00:18:05.236
went to law school,

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:07.990
and practices as a lawyer in Algiers today,

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:09.591
something which is only possible

00:18:09.591 --> 00:18:10.780
because the armed fundamentalists

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.658
were largely defeated in the country.

00:18:13.658 --> 00:18:16.505
And the second place I found Amel's hope

00:18:16.505 --> 00:18:18.977
was everywhere that women and men

00:18:18.977 --> 00:18:21.672
continue to defy the jihadis.

00:18:21.672 --> 00:18:24.930
We must support all of those in honor of Amel

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.563
who continue this human rights struggle today,

00:18:27.563 --> 00:18:31.560
like the Network of Women
Living Under Muslim Laws.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.187
It is not enough, as the victims rights advocate

00:18:34.187 --> 00:18:36.074
Cherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers,

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:39.139
it is not enough just to battle terrorism.

00:18:39.139 --> 00:18:41.683
We must also challenge fundamentalism,

00:18:41.683 --> 00:18:44.120
because fundamentalism is the ideology

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.711
that makes the bed of this terrorism.

00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:50.150
Why is it that people like her, like all of them

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.844
are not more well known?

00:18:51.844 --> 00:18:55.121
Why is it that everyone knows
who Osama bin Laden was

00:18:55.121 --> 00:18:57.054
and so few know of all of those

00:18:57.054 --> 00:19:00.747
standing up to the bin Ladens in their own contexts.

00:19:00.747 --> 00:19:03.404
We must change that, and so I ask you

00:19:03.404 --> 00:19:05.172
to please help share these stories

00:19:05.172 --> 00:19:06.945
through your networks.

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:09.044
Look again at Amel Zenoune's watch,

00:19:09.044 --> 00:19:10.704
forever frozen,

00:19:10.704 --> 00:19:13.066
and now please look at your own watch

00:19:13.066 --> 00:19:16.090
and decide this is the moment that you commit

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.998
to supporting people like Amel.

00:19:17.998 --> 00:19:20.379
We don't have the right to be silent about them

00:19:20.379 --> 00:19:21.877
because it is easier

00:19:21.877 --> 00:19:24.738
or because Western policy is flawed as well,

00:19:24.738 --> 00:19:27.074
because 5:17 is still coming

00:19:27.074 --> 00:19:28.941
to too many Amel Zenounes

00:19:28.941 --> 00:19:30.911
in places like northern Nigeria,

00:19:30.911 --> 00:19:33.487
where jihadis still kill students.

00:19:33.487 --> 00:19:36.568
The time to speak up in support of all of those

00:19:36.568 --> 00:19:38.876
who peacefully challenge fundamentalism

00:19:38.876 --> 00:19:41.840
and terrorism in their own communities

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.376
is now.

00:19:43.376 --> 00:19:45.659
Thank you.

00:19:45.659 --> 00:19:48.165
(Applause)
