00:00:00.657 --> 00:00:03.111
(Video) Nicholas Negroponte: 
Can we switch to the video disc,

00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:05.234
which is in play mode?

00:00:05.234 --> 00:00:10.464
I'm really interested in how you put people and computers together.

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:13.834
We will be using the TV screens or their equivalents

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:18.208
for electronic books of the future.

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:21.822
(Music, crosstalk)

00:00:38.117 --> 00:00:40.369
Very interested in touch-sensitive displays,

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:44.696
high-tech, high-touch, not having
to pick up your fingers to use them.

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:46.496
There is another way where computers

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:48.959
touch people: wearing, physically wearing.

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:58.667
Suddenly on September 11th,

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:01.304
the world got bigger.

00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:04.289
NN: Thank you. (Applause)

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:06.348
Thank you.

00:01:06.348 --> 00:01:08.456
When I was asked to do this,

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:12.652
I was also asked to look at all 14 TED Talks

00:01:12.652 --> 00:01:14.362
that I had given,

00:01:14.362 --> 00:01:16.160
chronologically.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.434
The first one was actually two hours.

00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:19.890
The second one was an hour,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.439
and then they became half hours,

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.375
and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger.

00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:26.995
(Laughter)

00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:31.163
Imagine seeing your life, 30 years of it, go by,

00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:34.570
and it was, to say the least,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.943
for me, quite a shocking experience.

00:01:38.943 --> 00:01:40.536
So what I'm going to do in my time

00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:42.080
is try and share with you what happened

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.882
during the 30 years,

00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:46.400
and then also make a prediction,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.461
and then tell you a little bit

00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:51.115
about what I'm doing next.

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:54.066
And I put on a slide

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:58.126
where TED 1 happened in my life.

00:01:58.126 --> 00:02:00.040
And it's rather important

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.100
because I had done 15 years of research before it,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.528
so I had a backlog, so it was easy.

00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:08.288
It's not that I was Fidel Castro

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:10.121
and I could talk for two hours,

00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:11.443
or Bucky Fuller.

00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:13.358
I had 15 years of stuff,

00:02:13.358 --> 00:02:15.830
and the Media Lab was about to start.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.630
So that was easy.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.294
But there are a couple of things

00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:21.982
about that period

00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:24.035
and about what happened that are

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.890
really quite important.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.446
One is that

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:31.342
it was a period when computers

00:02:31.342 --> 00:02:33.979
weren't yet for people.

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.124
And the other thing that sort of happened

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:40.195
during that time is that

00:02:40.195 --> 00:02:43.577
we were considered sissy computer scientists.

00:02:43.577 --> 00:02:45.140
We weren't considered the real thing.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.139
So what I'm going to show you is, in retrospect,

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.647
a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted

00:02:51.647 --> 00:02:53.713
than it was at the time.

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:56.267
So I'm going to characterize the years

00:02:56.267 --> 00:02:58.100
and I'm even going to go back

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.204
to some very early work of mine,

00:03:00.204 --> 00:03:03.090
and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '60s:

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.277
very direct manipulation,

00:03:05.277 --> 00:03:07.932
very influenced as I studied architecture

00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:10.019
by the architect Moshe Safdie,

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.781
and you can see that we even built robotic things

00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:15.537
that could build habitat-like structures.

00:03:15.537 --> 00:03:17.224
And this for me was

00:03:17.224 --> 00:03:19.140
not yet the Media Lab,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.957
but was the beginning of what I'll call

00:03:21.957 --> 00:03:23.476
sensory computing,

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:25.348
and I pick fingers

00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:29.550
partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.705
Papers were published

00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:35.957
about how stupid it was to use fingers.

00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:38.775
Three reasons: One was they were low-resolution.

00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:40.704
The other is your hand would occlude

00:03:40.704 --> 00:03:42.145
what you wanted to see,

00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:43.903
and the third, which was the winner,

00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:47.559
was that your fingers would get the screen dirty,

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.885
and hence, fingers would never be

00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:51.673
a device that you'd use.

00:03:51.673 --> 00:03:54.722
And this was a device we built in the '70s,

00:03:54.722 --> 00:03:56.593
which has never even been picked up.

00:03:56.593 --> 00:03:58.034
It's not just touch sensitive,

00:03:58.034 --> 00:04:00.212
it's pressure sensitive.

00:04:00.212 --> 00:04:02.189
(Video) Voice: Put a yellow circle there.

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.633
NN: Later work, and again this was before TED 1 —

00:04:05.633 --> 00:04:08.436
(Video) Voice: Move that west of the diamond.

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:11.648
Create a large green circle there.

00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:13.977
Man: Aw, shit.

00:04:13.977 --> 00:04:17.407
NN: — was to sort of do interface concurrently,

00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:19.215
so when you talked and you pointed

00:04:19.215 --> 00:04:22.402
and you had, if you will,

00:04:22.402 --> 00:04:23.961
multiple channels.

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:25.968
Entebbe happened.

00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:29.515
1976, Air France was hijacked,

00:04:29.515 --> 00:04:31.013
taken to Entebbe,

00:04:31.013 --> 00:04:36.070
and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.033
they did it partly because they had practiced

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.528
on a physical model of the airport,

00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:41.684
because they had built the airport,

00:04:41.684 --> 00:04:43.417
so they built a model in the desert,

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:45.133
and when they arrived at Entebbe,

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:48.053
they knew where to go because
they had actually been there.

00:04:48.053 --> 00:04:51.305
The U.S. government asked some of us, '76,

00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:54.080
if we could replicate that computationally,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.269
and of course somebody like myself says yes.

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:58.295
Immediately, you get a contract,

00:04:58.295 --> 00:04:59.780
Department of Defense,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.468
and we built this truck and this rig.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.988
We did sort of a simulation,

00:05:04.988 --> 00:05:06.814
because you had video discs,

00:05:06.814 --> 00:05:09.142
and again, this is '76.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.839
And then many years later,

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.308
you get this truck,

00:05:13.308 --> 00:05:16.266
and so you have Google Maps.

00:05:16.266 --> 00:05:17.786
Still people thought,

00:05:17.786 --> 00:05:21.806
no, that was not serious computer science,

00:05:21.806 --> 00:05:23.865
and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner,

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.272
who happened to be the president of MIT,

00:05:26.272 --> 00:05:28.620
who did think it was computer science.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.257
And one of the keys for anybody

00:05:31.257 --> 00:05:34.641
who wants to start something in life:

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:37.910
Make sure your president is part of it.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.930
So when I was doing the Media Lab,

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.087
it was like having a gorilla in the front seat.

00:05:44.087 --> 00:05:46.272
If you were stopped for speeding

00:05:46.272 --> 00:05:48.512
and the officer looked in the window

00:05:48.512 --> 00:05:50.521
and saw who was in the passenger seat,

00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:52.483
then, "Oh, continue on, sir."

00:05:52.483 --> 00:05:54.168
And so we were able,

00:05:54.168 --> 00:05:57.961
and this is a cute, actually, device, parenthetically.

00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:01.010
This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.373
where the only thing that changed in the photograph

00:06:03.373 --> 00:06:04.716
were the lips.

00:06:04.716 --> 00:06:07.692
So when you oscillated that little piece

00:06:07.692 --> 00:06:10.922
of lenticular sheet with his photograph,

00:06:10.922 --> 00:06:12.935
it would be in lip sync

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:15.174
with zero bandwidth.

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:17.885
It was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system

00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:19.727
at the time.

00:06:19.727 --> 00:06:23.708
So this was the Media Lab's —

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:25.401
this is what we said we'd do,

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:27.976
that the world of computers, publishing,

00:06:27.976 --> 00:06:30.664
and so on would come together.

00:06:30.664 --> 00:06:32.768
Again, not generally accepted,

00:06:32.768 --> 00:06:37.740
but very much part of TED in the early days.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.946
And this is really where we were headed.

00:06:40.946 --> 00:06:42.633
And that created the Media Lab.

00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:46.884
One of the things about age

00:06:46.884 --> 00:06:51.151
is that I can tell you with great confidence,

00:06:51.151 --> 00:06:53.615
I've been to the future.

00:06:53.615 --> 00:06:56.899
I've been there, actually, many times.

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:58.407
And the reason I say that is,

00:06:58.407 --> 00:07:00.848
how many times in my life have I said,

00:07:00.848 --> 00:07:02.625
"Oh, in 10 years, this will happen,"

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:04.673
and then 10 years comes.

00:07:04.673 --> 00:07:06.431
And then you say, "Oh, in
five years, this will happen."

00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:08.115
And then five years comes.

00:07:08.115 --> 00:07:11.873
So I say this a little bit with having felt

00:07:11.873 --> 00:07:14.210
that I'd been there a number of times,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.850
and one of the things that is most quoted

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.999
that I've ever said

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:21.382
is that computing is not about computers,

00:07:21.382 --> 00:07:24.938
and that didn't quite get enough traction,

00:07:24.938 --> 00:07:26.457
and then it started to.

00:07:26.457 --> 00:07:30.152
It started to because people caught on

00:07:30.152 --> 00:07:33.290
that the medium wasn't the message.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.935
And the reason I show this car

00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:38.263
in actually a rather ugly slide

00:07:38.263 --> 00:07:40.767
is just again to tell you the kind of story

00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:43.595
that characterized a little bit of my life.

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:45.609
This is a student of mine

00:07:45.609 --> 00:07:49.160
who had done a Ph.D. called "Backseat Driver."

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.242
It was in the early days of GPS,

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:52.808
the car knew where it was,

00:07:52.808 --> 00:07:54.723
and it would give audio instructions

00:07:54.723 --> 00:07:58.150
to the driver, when to turn right, 
when to turn left and so on.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.761
Turns out, there are a lot of things

00:07:59.761 --> 00:08:02.796
in those instructions that back in that period

00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:04.046
were pretty challenging,

00:08:04.046 --> 00:08:07.274
like what does it mean, take the next right?

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:09.174
Well, if you're coming up on a street,

00:08:09.174 --> 00:08:11.357
the next right's probably the one after,

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:12.588
and there are lots of issues,

00:08:12.588 --> 00:08:14.833
and the student did a wonderful thesis,

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:19.680
and the MIT patent office said "Don't patent it.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.620
It'll never be accepted.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.930
The liabilities are too large.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.321
There will be insurance issues.

00:08:25.321 --> 00:08:26.965
Don't patent it."

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.058
So we didn't,

00:08:28.058 --> 00:08:31.696
but it shows you how people, again, at times,

00:08:31.696 --> 00:08:35.895
don't really look at what's happening.

00:08:35.895 --> 00:08:38.790
Some work, and I'll just go
through these very quickly,

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.395
a lot of sensory stuff.

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.870
You might recognize a young Yo-Yo Ma

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.840
and tracking his body for playing

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.188
the cello or the hypercello.

00:08:49.188 --> 00:08:53.165
These fellows literally walked 
around like that at the time.

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:55.800
It's now a little bit more discreet

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.841
and more commonplace.

00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:00.110
And then there are at least three heroes

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.239
I want to quickly mention.

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:03.717
Marvin Minsky, who taught me a lot

00:09:03.717 --> 00:09:05.104
about common sense,

00:09:05.104 --> 00:09:08.545
and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper,

00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:11.163
who was very important to Ricky Wurman

00:09:11.163 --> 00:09:14.898
and to TED, and in fact, when she got onstage,

00:09:14.898 --> 00:09:16.845
she said, the first thing she said was,

00:09:16.845 --> 00:09:18.999
"I introduced Ricky to Nicky."

00:09:18.999 --> 00:09:20.699
And nobody calls me Nicky

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:22.458
and nobody calls Richard Ricky,

00:09:22.458 --> 00:09:25.860
so nobody knew who she was talking about.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.257
And then, of course, Seymour Papert,

00:09:28.257 --> 00:09:29.762
who is the person who said,

00:09:29.762 --> 00:09:31.177
"You can't think about thinking

00:09:31.177 --> 00:09:33.592
unless you think about thinking about something."

00:09:33.592 --> 00:09:39.255
And that's actually — you can unpack that later.

00:09:39.255 --> 00:09:43.361
It's a pretty profound statement.

00:09:43.361 --> 00:09:45.101
I'm showing some slides

00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:47.187
that were from TED 2,

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:50.929
a little silly as slides, perhaps.

00:09:50.929 --> 00:09:56.270
Then I felt television really was about displays.

00:09:56.273 --> 00:09:59.336
Again, now we're past TED 1,

00:09:59.336 --> 00:10:02.362
but just around the time of TED 2,

00:10:02.362 --> 00:10:04.511
and what I'd like to mention here is,

00:10:04.511 --> 00:10:06.626
even though you could imagine

00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:08.680
intelligence in the device,

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.112
I look today at some of the work

00:10:10.112 --> 00:10:12.550
being done about the Internet of Things,

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.490
and I think it's kind of tragically pathetic,

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.920
because what has happened is people take

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.418
the oven panel and put it on your cell phone,

00:10:21.418 --> 00:10:23.207
or the door key onto your cell phone,

00:10:23.207 --> 00:10:25.380
just taking it and bringing it to you,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.101
and in fact that's actually what you don't want.

00:10:28.101 --> 00:10:30.159
You want to put a chicken in the oven,

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:32.487
and the oven says, "Aha, it's a chicken,"

00:10:32.487 --> 00:10:33.636
and it cooks the chicken.

00:10:33.636 --> 00:10:35.402
"Oh, it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas,

00:10:35.402 --> 00:10:37.236
and he likes it this way and that way."

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:40.289
So the intelligence, instead of being in the device,

00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:41.998
we have started today

00:10:41.998 --> 00:10:44.110
to move it back onto the cell phone

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.480
or closer to the user,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.668
not a particularly enlightened view

00:10:48.668 --> 00:10:51.409
of the Internet of Things.

00:10:51.409 --> 00:10:54.873
Television, again, television what I said today,

00:10:54.873 --> 00:10:57.495
that was back in 1990,

00:10:57.495 --> 00:10:58.965
and the television of tomorrow

00:10:58.965 --> 00:11:01.288
would look something like that.

00:11:01.288 --> 00:11:04.832
Again, people, but they laughed cynically,

00:11:04.832 --> 00:11:10.083
they didn't laugh with much appreciation.

00:11:10.083 --> 00:11:12.733
Telecommunications in the 1990s,

00:11:12.733 --> 00:11:18.433
George Gilder decided that he would call this diagram

00:11:18.433 --> 00:11:20.862
the Negroponte switch.

00:11:20.862 --> 00:11:22.868
I'm probably much less famous than George,

00:11:22.868 --> 00:11:26.475
so when he called it the Negroponte switch, it stuck,

00:11:26.475 --> 00:11:29.140
but the idea of things that came in the ground

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.855
would go in the air and stuff in the air

00:11:30.855 --> 00:11:32.314
would go into the ground

00:11:32.314 --> 00:11:34.199
has played itself out.

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:38.944
That is the original slide from that year,

00:11:38.944 --> 00:11:42.319
and it has worked in lockstep obedience.

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:44.486
We started Wired magazine.

00:11:44.486 --> 00:11:48.222
Some people, I remember we shared

00:11:48.222 --> 00:11:50.944
the reception desk periodically,

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:55.002
and some parent called up irate that his son

00:11:55.002 --> 00:11:57.231
had given up Sports Illustrated

00:11:57.231 --> 00:11:59.110
to subscribe for Wired,

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.307
and he said, "Are you some
porno magazine or something?"

00:12:02.307 --> 00:12:04.891
and couldn't understand why his son

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:08.790
would be interested in Wired, at any rate.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.394
I will go through this a little quicker.

00:12:11.394 --> 00:12:14.893
This is my favorite, 1995,

00:12:14.893 --> 00:12:17.930
back page of Newsweek magazine.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.899
Okay. Read it. (Laughter)

00:12:19.899 --> 00:12:21.800
["Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh, sure."
—Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, 1995]

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.445
You must admit that gives you,

00:12:23.445 --> 00:12:25.672
at least it gives me pleasure

00:12:25.672 --> 00:12:29.430
when somebody says how dead wrong you are.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.576
"Being Digital" came out.

00:12:31.576 --> 00:12:34.217
For me, it gave me an opportunity

00:12:34.217 --> 00:12:36.419
to be more in the trade press

00:12:36.419 --> 00:12:39.690
and get this out to the public,

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.705
and it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab,

00:12:42.705 --> 00:12:44.638
which if you haven't been to, visit,

00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:47.657
because it's a beautiful piece of architecture

00:12:47.657 --> 00:12:50.482
aside from being a wonderful place to work.

00:12:50.482 --> 00:12:53.177
So these are the things we were saying in those TEDs.

00:12:53.177 --> 00:12:54.744
[Today, multimedia is a desktop or living room experience, because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small, bright, thin, high-resolution displays. — 1995]

00:12:54.744 --> 00:12:56.236
We came to them.

00:12:56.236 --> 00:12:58.228
I looked forward to it every year.

00:12:58.228 --> 00:13:01.280
It was the party that Ricky Wurman never had

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.189
in the sense that he invited many of his old friends,

00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:05.848
including myself.

00:13:05.848 --> 00:13:08.240
And then something for me changed

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.709
pretty profoundly.

00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:13.662
I became more involved with computers and learning

00:13:13.662 --> 00:13:16.124
and influenced by Seymour,

00:13:16.124 --> 00:13:18.739
but particularly looking at learning

00:13:18.739 --> 00:13:22.649
as something that is best approximated

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:24.403
by computer programming.

00:13:24.403 --> 00:13:26.417
When you write a computer program,

00:13:26.417 --> 00:13:29.212
you've got to not just list things out

00:13:29.212 --> 00:13:30.940
and sort of take an algorithm

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.816
and translate it into a set of instructions,

00:13:33.816 --> 00:13:36.499
but when there's a bug, and all programs have bugs,

00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:38.208
you've got to de-bug it.

00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:40.198
You've got to go in, change it,

00:13:40.198 --> 00:13:41.820
and then re-execute,

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.624
and you iterate,

00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:46.531
and that iteration is really

00:13:46.531 --> 00:13:49.434
a very, very good approximation of learning.

00:13:49.434 --> 00:13:53.101
So that led to my own work with Seymour

00:13:53.101 --> 00:13:55.459
in places like Cambodia

00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:58.363
and the starting of One Laptop per Child.

00:13:58.363 --> 00:14:01.177
Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child,

00:14:01.177 --> 00:14:02.938
so I'll go through it very fast,

00:14:02.938 --> 00:14:06.863
but it did give us the chance

00:14:06.863 --> 00:14:10.369
to do something at a relatively large scale

00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:14.362
in the area of learning, development and computing.

00:14:14.362 --> 00:14:17.179
Very few people know that One Laptop per Child

00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:19.814
was a $1 billion project,

00:14:19.814 --> 00:14:22.461
and it was, at least over the seven years I ran it,

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:24.607
but even more important, the World Bank

00:14:24.607 --> 00:14:27.722
contributed zero, USAID zero.

00:14:27.722 --> 00:14:31.877
It was mostly the countries
using their own treasuries,

00:14:31.877 --> 00:14:33.480
which is very interesting,

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.836
at least to me it was very interesting

00:14:34.836 --> 00:14:37.980
in terms of what I plan to do next.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.005
So these are the various places it happened.

00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:43.907
I then tried an experiment,

00:14:43.907 --> 00:14:48.188
and the experiment happened in Ethiopia.

00:14:48.188 --> 00:14:50.830
And here's the experiment.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.461
The experiment is,

00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:56.241
can learning happen where there are no schools.

00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:58.771
And we dropped off tablets

00:14:58.771 --> 00:15:01.014
with no instructions

00:15:01.014 --> 00:15:04.287
and let the children figure it out.

00:15:04.287 --> 00:15:07.934
And in a short period of time,

00:15:07.934 --> 00:15:10.032
they not only

00:15:10.032 --> 00:15:13.104
turned them on and were using 50 apps per child

00:15:13.104 --> 00:15:15.206
within five days,

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:18.140
they were singing "ABC" songs within two weeks,

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.033
but they hacked Android within six months.

00:15:22.033 --> 00:15:25.551
And so that seemed sufficiently interesting.

00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:28.110
This is perhaps the best picture I have.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:32.261
The kid on your right

00:15:32.261 --> 00:15:34.736
has sort of nominated himself as teacher.

00:15:34.736 --> 00:15:37.256
Look at the kid on the left, and so on.

00:15:37.256 --> 00:15:40.406
There are no adults involved in this at all.

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:41.830
So I said, well can we do this

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.427
at a larger scale?

00:15:43.427 --> 00:15:45.908
And what is it that's missing?

00:15:45.908 --> 00:15:48.177
The kids are giving a press conference at this point,

00:15:48.177 --> 00:15:50.862
and sort of writing in the dirt.

00:15:50.862 --> 00:15:54.307
And the answer is, what is missing?

00:15:54.307 --> 00:15:56.843
And I'm going to skip over my prediction, actually,

00:15:56.843 --> 00:15:58.371
because I'm running out of time,

00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:02.339
and here's the question, is what's going to happen?

00:16:02.339 --> 00:16:03.826
I think the challenge

00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:06.454
is to connect the last billion people,

00:16:06.454 --> 00:16:09.105
and connecting the last billion

00:16:09.105 --> 00:16:12.502
is very different than connecting the next billion,

00:16:12.502 --> 00:16:13.896
and the reason it's different

00:16:13.896 --> 00:16:15.760
is that the next billion

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.710
are sort of low-hanging fruit,

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.077
but the last billion are rural.

00:16:21.077 --> 00:16:24.829
Being rural and being poor

00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:25.961
are very different.

00:16:25.961 --> 00:16:29.594
Poverty tends to be created by our society,

00:16:29.594 --> 00:16:35.044
and the people in that community are not poor

00:16:35.044 --> 00:16:36.953
in the same way at all.

00:16:36.953 --> 00:16:38.358
They may be primitive,

00:16:38.358 --> 00:16:42.402
but the way to approach it and to connect them,

00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:44.933
the history of One Laptop per Child,

00:16:44.933 --> 00:16:48.589
and the experiment in Ethiopia,

00:16:48.589 --> 00:16:51.864
lead me to believe that we can in fact

00:16:51.864 --> 00:16:54.665
do this in a very short period of time.

00:16:54.665 --> 00:16:56.506
And so my plan,

00:16:56.506 --> 00:16:58.740
and unfortunately I haven't been able

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.608
to get my partners at this point

00:17:01.608 --> 00:17:02.899
to let me announce them,

00:17:02.899 --> 00:17:07.806
but is to do this with a stationary satellite.

00:17:07.806 --> 00:17:10.265
There are many reasons

00:17:10.265 --> 00:17:14.780
that stationary satellites aren't the best things,

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.717
but there are a lot of reasons why they are,

00:17:17.717 --> 00:17:20.812
and for two billion dollars,

00:17:20.812 --> 00:17:24.496
you can connect a lot more than 100 million people,

00:17:24.496 --> 00:17:27.157
but the reason I picked two,

00:17:27.157 --> 00:17:30.540
and I will leave this as my last slide,

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.324
is two billion dollars

00:17:32.324 --> 00:17:35.243
is what we were spending

00:17:35.243 --> 00:17:37.336
in Afghanistan

00:17:37.336 --> 00:17:39.248
every week.

00:17:39.248 --> 00:17:42.555
So surely if we can connect

00:17:42.555 --> 00:17:45.255
Africa and the last billion people

00:17:45.255 --> 00:17:46.809
for numbers like that,

00:17:46.809 --> 00:17:48.122
we should be doing it.

00:17:48.122 --> 00:17:50.419
Thank you very much.

00:17:50.419 --> 00:17:53.948
(Applause)

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:58.278
Chris Anderson: Stay up there. Stay up there.

00:17:58.278 --> 00:18:00.308
NN: You're going to give me extra time?

00:18:00.308 --> 00:18:02.670
CA: No. That was wickedly clever, wickedly clever.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.535
You gamed it beautifully.

00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:07.165
Nicholas, what is your prediction?

00:18:07.165 --> 00:18:09.191
(Laughter)

00:18:09.191 --> 00:18:11.627
NN: Thank you for asking.

00:18:11.627 --> 00:18:14.400
I'll tell you what my prediction is,

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.100
and my prediction, and this is a prediction,

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.762
because it'll be 30 years. I won't be here.

00:18:19.762 --> 00:18:24.490
But one of the things about learning how to read,

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.339
we have been doing a lot of consuming

00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:29.624
of information going through our eyes,

00:18:29.624 --> 00:18:32.700
and so that may be a very inefficient channel.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:37.785
So my prediction is that we are 
going to ingest information

00:18:37.785 --> 00:18:40.982
You're going to swallow a pill and know English.

00:18:40.982 --> 00:18:43.674
You're going to swallow a
pill and know Shakespeare.

00:18:43.674 --> 00:18:46.283
And the way to do it is through the bloodstream.

00:18:46.283 --> 00:18:48.140
So once it's in your bloodstream,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.358
it basically goes through it and gets into the brain,

00:18:50.358 --> 00:18:52.540
and when it knows that it's in the brain

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.862
in the different pieces,

00:18:53.862 --> 00:18:56.487
it deposits it in the right places.

00:18:56.487 --> 00:18:57.819
So it's ingesting.

00:18:57.819 --> 00:19:00.339
CA: Have you been hanging out
with Ray Kurzweil by any chance?

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:03.552
NN: No, but I've been hanging
around with Ed Boyden

00:19:03.552 --> 00:19:05.397
and hanging around with one of the speakers

00:19:05.397 --> 00:19:07.210
who is here, Hugh Herr,

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.107
and there are a number of people.

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:10.504
This isn't quite as far-fetched,

00:19:10.504 --> 00:19:13.449
so 30 years from now.

00:19:13.449 --> 00:19:15.191
CA: We will check it out.

00:19:15.191 --> 00:19:17.493
We're going to be back and we're going
to play this clip 30 years from now,

00:19:17.493 --> 00:19:20.524
and then all eat the red pill.

00:19:20.524 --> 00:19:22.709
Well thank you for that.

00:19:22.709 --> 00:19:24.153
Nicholas Negroponte.

00:19:24.153 --> 00:19:25.501
NN: Thank you.

00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:26.315
(Applause)
