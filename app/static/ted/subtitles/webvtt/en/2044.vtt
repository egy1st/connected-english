00:00:00.916 --> 00:00:03.170
When I was preparing for this talk,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.146
I went to search for a couple of quotes

00:00:05.146 --> 00:00:06.991
that I can share with you.

00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.162
Good news: I found three

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:10.994
that I particularly liked,

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:14.472
the first by Samuel Johnson, who said,

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:16.712
"When making your choice in life,

00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:19.468
do not forget to live,"

00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:23.000
the second by Aeschylus, who reminded us that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.305
"happiness is a choice that requires effort,"

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:30.830
and the third is one by Groucho Marx

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.920
who said, "I wouldn't want to choose to belong

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.252
to any club that would have me as a member."

00:00:39.252 --> 00:00:41.318
Now, bad news:

00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:43.429
I didn't know which one of these quotes

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.178
to choose and share with you.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:49.403
The sweet anxiety of choice.

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:53.446
In today's times of post-industrial capitalism,

00:00:53.446 --> 00:00:57.109
choice, together with individual freedom

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.970
and the idea of self-making,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.500
has been elevated to an ideal.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.387
Now, together with this, we also have a belief

00:01:07.387 --> 00:01:10.155
in endless progress.

00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:12.911
But the underside of this ideology

00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:16.443
has been an increase of anxiety,

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.513
feelings of guilt,

00:01:18.513 --> 00:01:22.217
feelings of being inadequate,

00:01:22.217 --> 00:01:26.954
feeling that we are failing in our choices.

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:30.950
Sadly, this ideology of individual choice

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.400
has prevented us from thinking about social changes.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.319
It appears that this ideology was actually

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.001
very efficient in pacifying us

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.797
as political and social thinkers.

00:01:44.797 --> 00:01:47.113
Instead of making social critiques,

00:01:47.113 --> 00:01:50.869
we are more and more engaging in self-critique,

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.122
sometimes to the point of self-destruction.

00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:57.867
Now, how come that ideology of choice

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.450
is still so powerful,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.546
even among people who have

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:04.655
not many things to choose among?

00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:08.229
How come that even people who are poor

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.620
very much still identify with the idea of choice,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.689
the kind of rational idea of choice

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.322
which we embrace?

00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:21.340
Now, the ideology of choice is very successful

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.320
in opening for us a space to think

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.987
about some imagined future.

00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:31.000
Let me give you an example.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.913
My friend Manya,

00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:35.962
when she was a student at university in California,

00:02:35.962 --> 00:02:37.660
was earning money

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.720
by working for a car dealer.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.531
Now, Manya, when she encountered

00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:45.389
the typical customer, would debate with him

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.233
about his lifestyle,

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.956
how much he wants to spend,

00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:51.700
how many children he has,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.973
what does he need the car for?

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:56.660
They would usually come to a good conclusion

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.214
what would be a perfect car.

00:02:59.214 --> 00:03:02.702
Now, before Manya's customer would go home

00:03:02.702 --> 00:03:05.140
and think things through,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.960
she would say to him,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.745
"The car that you are buying now is perfect,

00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:12.770
but in a few year's time,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.403
when your kids will be already out of the house,

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:18.370
when you will have a little bit more money,

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.399
that other car will be ideal.

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.936
But what you are buying now is great."

00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:27.293
Now, the majority of Manya's customers

00:03:27.293 --> 00:03:28.913
who came back the next day

00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:31.738
bought that other car,

00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:33.795
the car they did not need,

00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:36.833
the car that cost far too much money.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:39.769
Now, Manya became so successful in selling cars

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.671
that soon she moved on to selling airplanes.

00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:47.265
(Laughter)

00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:51.350
And knowing so much about
the psychology of people

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.924
prepared her well for her current job,

00:03:52.924 --> 00:03:56.755
which is that of a psychoanalyst.

00:03:56.755 --> 00:04:01.278
Now, why were Manya's customers so irrational?

00:04:01.278 --> 00:04:03.775
Manya's success was that she was able

00:04:03.775 --> 00:04:06.700
to open in their heads an image

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.280
of an idealized future,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.190
an image of themselves

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.420
when they are already more successful, freer,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.669
and for them, choosing that other car

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.729
was as if they are coming closer to this ideal

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.578
in which it was as if Manya already saw them.

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:30.981
Now, we rarely make really totally rational choices.

00:04:30.981 --> 00:04:34.559
Choices are influenced by our unconscious,

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:36.398
by our community.

00:04:36.398 --> 00:04:38.328
We're often choosing

00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:40.482
by guessing, what would other people

00:04:40.482 --> 00:04:43.466
think about our choice?

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:44.671
Also we are choosing

00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:47.040
by looking at what others are choosing.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.845
We're also guessing what is
socially acceptable choice.

00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:54.916
Now, because of this, we actually

00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:56.805
even after we have already chosen,

00:04:56.805 --> 00:04:58.560
like bought a car,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.710
endlessly read reviews about cars,

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.070
as if we still want to convince ourselves

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.671
that we made the right choice.

00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:09.870
Now, choices are anxiety-provoking.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.951
They are linked to risks, losses.

00:05:12.951 --> 00:05:15.306
They are highly unpredictable.

00:05:15.306 --> 00:05:17.415
Now, because of this,

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:19.918
people have now more and more problems

00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:23.376
that they are not choosing anything.

00:05:23.376 --> 00:05:27.207
Not long ago, I was at a wedding reception,

00:05:27.207 --> 00:05:29.511
and I met a young, beautiful woman

00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:34.137
who immediately started telling
me about her anxiety over choice.

00:05:34.137 --> 00:05:36.108
She said to me, "I needed one month

00:05:36.108 --> 00:05:39.154
to decide which dress to wear."

00:05:39.154 --> 00:05:41.675
Then she said, "For weeks I was researching

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:44.936
which hotel to stay for this one night.

00:05:44.936 --> 00:05:49.434
And now, I need to choose a sperm donor."

00:05:49.434 --> 00:05:52.201
(Laughter)

00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:55.700
I looked at this woman in shock.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.737
"Sperm donor? What's the rush?"

00:05:58.737 --> 00:06:02.911
She said, "I'm turning 40 at the end of this year,

00:06:02.911 --> 00:06:07.736
and I've been so bad in choosing men in my life."

00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:12.142
Now choice, because it's linked to risk,

00:06:12.142 --> 00:06:14.419
is anxiety-provoking,

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.276
and it was already the famous

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:19.869
Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:22.583
who pointed out that anxiety

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:25.848
is linked to the possibility of possibility.

00:06:25.848 --> 00:06:30.281
Now, we think today that we can prevent these risks.

00:06:30.281 --> 00:06:33.362
We have endless market analysis,

00:06:33.362 --> 00:06:35.871
projections of the future earnings.

00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:38.571
Even with market, which is about chance,

00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:42.711
randomness, we think we can predict rationally

00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:44.434
where it's going.

00:06:44.434 --> 00:06:49.281
Now, chance is actually becoming very traumatic.

00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:52.171
Last year, my friend Bernard Harcourt

00:06:52.171 --> 00:06:56.446
at the University of Chicago organized an event,

00:06:56.446 --> 00:06:59.843
a conference on the idea of chance.

00:06:59.843 --> 00:07:01.929
He and I were together on the panel,

00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:04.446
and just before delivering our papers —

00:07:04.446 --> 00:07:06.796
we didn't know each other's papers —

00:07:06.796 --> 00:07:09.304
we decided to take chance seriously.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.140
So we informed our audience

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.489
that what they will just now hear

00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:15.502
will be a random paper,

00:07:15.502 --> 00:07:17.674
a mixture of the two papers

00:07:17.674 --> 00:07:21.545
which we didn't know what each was writing.

00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:25.725
Now, we delivered the conference in such a way.

00:07:25.725 --> 00:07:27.946
Bernard read his first paragraph,

00:07:27.946 --> 00:07:30.070
I read my first paragraph,

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.277
Bernard read his second paragraph,

00:07:32.277 --> 00:07:33.762
I read my second paragraph,

00:07:33.762 --> 00:07:37.384
in this way towards the end of our papers.

00:07:37.384 --> 00:07:39.263
Now, you will be surprised

00:07:39.263 --> 00:07:41.445
that a majority of our audience

00:07:41.445 --> 00:07:44.188
did not think that what they'd just listened to

00:07:44.188 --> 00:07:47.473
was a completely random paper.

00:07:47.473 --> 00:07:49.419
They couldn't believe that

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:51.939
speaking from the position of authority

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:53.817
like two professors we were,

00:07:53.817 --> 00:07:56.888
we would take chance seriously.

00:07:56.888 --> 00:07:59.475
They thought we prepared the papers together

00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:02.953
and were just joking that it's random.

00:08:02.953 --> 00:08:07.120
Now, we live in times with a lot of information,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.711
big data,

00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:11.715
a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies.

00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:13.458
We decoded our genome.

00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:16.569
We know about our brains more than before.

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:19.205
But surprisingly, people are more and more

00:08:19.205 --> 00:08:23.640
turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.633
Ignorance and denial are on the rise.

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:31.851
Now, in regard to the current economic crisis,

00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:34.505
we think that we will just wake up again

00:08:34.505 --> 00:08:36.721
and everything will be the same as before,

00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:39.984
and no political or social changes are needed.

00:08:39.984 --> 00:08:42.234
In regard to ecological crisis,

00:08:42.234 --> 00:08:45.350
we think nothing needs to be done just now,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.252
or others need to act before us.

00:08:48.252 --> 00:08:51.548
Or even when ecological crisis already happens,

00:08:51.548 --> 00:08:53.877
like a catastrophe in Fukushima,

00:08:53.877 --> 00:08:56.701
often we have people living in the same environment

00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:58.523
with the same amount of information,

00:08:58.523 --> 00:09:02.210
and half of them will be anxious about radiation

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.531
and half of them will ignore it.

00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:08.343
Now, psychoanalysts know very well

00:09:08.343 --> 00:09:10.818
that people surprisingly don't have

00:09:10.818 --> 00:09:12.607
passion for knowledge

00:09:12.607 --> 00:09:15.689
but passion for ignorance.

00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:17.174
Now, what does that mean?

00:09:17.174 --> 00:09:18.990
Let's say when we are facing

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.783
a life-threatening illness,

00:09:21.783 --> 00:09:24.989
a lot of people don't want to know that.

00:09:24.989 --> 00:09:28.387
They'd rather prefer denying the illness,

00:09:28.387 --> 00:09:31.661
which is why it's not so wise to inform them

00:09:31.661 --> 00:09:33.370
if they don't ask.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.800
Surprisingly, research shows that sometimes

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.644
people who deny their illness

00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:41.560
live longer than those who are rationally choosing

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.999
the best treatment.

00:09:43.999 --> 00:09:46.120
Now, this ignorance, however,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.849
is not very helpful on the level of the social.

00:09:50.849 --> 00:09:54.179
When we are ignorant about where we are heading,

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:58.364
a lot of social damage can be caused.

00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:00.445
Now, on top of facing ignorance,

00:10:00.445 --> 00:10:02.683
we are also facing today

00:10:02.683 --> 00:10:05.844
some kind of an obviousness.

00:10:05.844 --> 00:10:07.971
Now, it was French philosopher

00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:10.080
Louis Althusser who pointed out

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.643
that ideology functions in such a way

00:10:12.643 --> 00:10:16.509
that it creates a veil of obviousness.

00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:20.244
Before we do any social critique,

00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:24.631
it is necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness

00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:27.960
and to think through a little bit differently.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.997
If we go back to this ideology

00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:32.528
of individual, rational choice

00:10:32.528 --> 00:10:34.856
we often embrace,

00:10:34.856 --> 00:10:36.836
it's necessary precisely here

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:39.165
to lift this obviousness

00:10:39.165 --> 00:10:42.296
and to think a little bit differently.

00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:45.260
Now for me, a question often is

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.863
why we still embrace this idea of a self-made man

00:10:49.863 --> 00:10:53.395
on which capitalism relied from its beginning?

00:10:53.395 --> 00:10:55.880
Why do we think that we are really such masters

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.705
of our lives that we can rationally

00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:01.157
make the best ideal choices,

00:11:01.157 --> 00:11:04.386
that we don't accept losses and risks?

00:11:04.386 --> 00:11:07.671
And for me, it's very shocking to
see sometimes very poor people,

00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:10.015
for example, not supporting the idea

00:11:10.015 --> 00:11:13.633
of the rich being taxed more.

00:11:13.633 --> 00:11:15.681
Quite often here they still identify

00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:18.279
with a certain kind of a lottery mentality.

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:21.562
Okay, maybe they don't think that they will make it

00:11:21.562 --> 00:11:22.964
in the future, but maybe they think,

00:11:22.964 --> 00:11:26.153
my son might become the next Bill Gates.

00:11:26.153 --> 00:11:29.370
And who would want to tax one's son?

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.200
Or, a question for me is also,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.580
why would people who have no health insurance

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.561
not embrace universal healthcare?

00:11:38.561 --> 00:11:40.090
Sometimes they don't embrace it,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.914
again identifying with the idea of choice,

00:11:42.914 --> 00:11:45.472
but they have nothing to choose from.

00:11:45.472 --> 00:11:49.922
Now, Margaret Thatcher famously said

00:11:49.922 --> 00:11:52.554
that there is nothing like a society.

00:11:52.554 --> 00:11:56.334
Society doesn't exist, it is only individuals

00:11:56.334 --> 00:11:58.130
and their families.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:03.263
Sadly, this ideology still functions very well,

00:12:03.263 --> 00:12:05.547
which is why people who are poor might feel

00:12:05.547 --> 00:12:07.470
ashamed for their poverty.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.732
We might endlessly feel guilty that we are

00:12:09.732 --> 00:12:11.846
not making the right choices,

00:12:11.846 --> 00:12:14.142
and that's why we didn't succeed.

00:12:14.142 --> 00:12:17.674
We are anxious that we are not good enough.

00:12:17.674 --> 00:12:19.597
That's why we work very hard,

00:12:19.597 --> 00:12:21.138
long hours at the workplace

00:12:21.138 --> 00:12:25.576
and equally long hours on remaking ourselves.

00:12:25.576 --> 00:12:27.989
Now, when we are anxious over choices,

00:12:27.989 --> 00:12:32.421
sometimes we easily give our power of choice away.

00:12:32.421 --> 00:12:34.217
We identify with the guru

00:12:34.217 --> 00:12:35.496
who tells us what to do,

00:12:35.496 --> 00:12:38.140
self-help therapist,

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.919
or we embrace a totalitarian leader

00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:43.706
who appears to have no doubts about choices,

00:12:43.706 --> 00:12:45.790
who sort of knows.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.566
Now, often people ask me,

00:12:48.566 --> 00:12:50.940
"What did you learn by studying choice?"

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.111
And there is an important message that I did learn.

00:12:54.111 --> 00:12:56.598
When thinking about choices,

00:12:56.598 --> 00:13:01.558
I stopped taking choices too seriously, personally.

00:13:01.558 --> 00:13:04.180
First, I realized a lot of choice I make

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.639
is not rational.

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:07.543
It's linked to my unconscious,

00:13:07.543 --> 00:13:09.737
my guesses of what others are choosing,

00:13:09.737 --> 00:13:13.393
or what is a socially embraced choice.

00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:15.690
I also embrace the idea

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.330
that we should go beyond

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.254
thinking about individual choices,

00:13:19.254 --> 00:13:22.910
that it's very important to rethink social choices,

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.611
since this ideology of individual
choice has pacified us.

00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:29.749
It really prevented us to think about social change.

00:13:29.749 --> 00:13:33.480
We spend so much time
choosing things for ourselves

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.250
and barely reflect on

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.476
communal choices we can make.

00:13:37.476 --> 00:13:39.176
Now, we should not forget that choice

00:13:39.176 --> 00:13:41.860
is always linked to change.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.676
We can make individual changes,

00:13:43.676 --> 00:13:45.861
but we can make social changes.

00:13:45.861 --> 00:13:49.627
We can choose to have more wolves.

00:13:49.627 --> 00:13:52.394
We can choose to change our environment

00:13:52.394 --> 00:13:54.824
to have more bees.

00:13:54.824 --> 00:13:59.110
We can choose to have different rating agencies.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.573
We can choose to control corporations

00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:05.437
instead of allowing corporations to control us.

00:14:05.437 --> 00:14:08.852
We have a possibility to make changes.

00:14:08.852 --> 00:14:12.130
Now, I started with a quote from Samuel Johnson,

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.859
who said that when we make choice in life,

00:14:14.859 --> 00:14:17.446
we shouldn't forget to live.

00:14:17.446 --> 00:14:19.673
Finally, you can see

00:14:19.673 --> 00:14:21.180
I did have a choice

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.467
to choose one of the three quotes

00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:26.491
with which I wanted to start my lecture.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.390
I did have a choice,

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.698
such as nations, as people,

00:14:30.698 --> 00:14:32.970
we have choices too to rethink

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.282
in what kind of society we want to live in the future.

00:14:36.282 --> 00:14:38.333
Thank you.

00:14:38.333 --> 00:14:42.563
(Applause)
