00:00:00.774 --> 00:00:02.515
Right now

00:00:02.515 --> 00:00:05.989
you have a movie playing inside your head.

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:08.516
It's an amazing multi-track movie.

00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:11.840
It has 3D vision and surround sound

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.476
for what you're seeing and hearing right now,

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:16.795
but that's just the start of it.

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:21.978
Your movie has smell and taste and touch.

00:00:21.978 --> 00:00:24.530
It has a sense of your body,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.849
pain, hunger, orgasms.

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.890
It has emotions,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.426
anger and happiness.

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:38.220
It has memories, like scenes from your childhood

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.920
playing before you.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.375
And it has this constant voiceover narrative

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:49.751
in your stream of conscious thinking.

00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:54.824
At the heart of this movie is you

00:00:54.824 --> 00:00:59.189
experiencing all this directly.

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:04.881
This movie is your stream of consciousness,

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:06.188
the subject of experience

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:11.326
of the mind and the world.

00:01:11.326 --> 00:01:13.631
Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:15.648
of human existence.

00:01:15.648 --> 00:01:18.580
Each of us is conscious.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.309
We all have our own inner movie,

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:24.040
you and you and you.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.760
There's nothing we know about more directly.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.232
At least, I know about my consciousness directly.

00:01:31.232 --> 00:01:35.230
I can't be certain that you guys are conscious.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.658
Consciousness also is what makes life worth living.

00:01:38.658 --> 00:01:42.358
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives

00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:45.723
would have meaning or value.

00:01:45.723 --> 00:01:46.889
But at the same time, it's the most

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:51.059
mysterious phenomenon in the universe.

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:54.432
Why are we conscious?

00:01:54.432 --> 00:01:55.973
Why do we have these inner movies?

00:01:55.973 --> 00:01:58.226
Why aren't we just robots

00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:00.469
who process all this input,

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.486
produce all that output,

00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:06.341
without experiencing the inner movie at all?

00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:08.850
Right now, nobody knows the answers

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.596
to those questions.

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:14.305
I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness

00:02:14.305 --> 00:02:19.000
into science, some radical ideas may be needed.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.966
Some people say a science of consciousness

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:23.918
is impossible.

00:02:23.918 --> 00:02:27.686
Science, by its nature, is objective.

00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:31.111
Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective.

00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:35.560
So there can never be a science of consciousness.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.780
For much of the 20th century, that view held sway.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.598
Psychologists studied behavior objectively,

00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:46.660
neuroscientists studied the brain objectively,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.210
and nobody even mentioned consciousness.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.966
Even 30 years ago, when TED got started,

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:55.348
there was very little scientific work

00:02:55.348 --> 00:02:57.900
on consciousness.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.605
Now, about 20 years ago,

00:02:59.605 --> 00:03:02.578
all that began to change.

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:05.355
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick

00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:08.111
and physicists like Roger Penrose

00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:10.351
said now is the time for science

00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:13.127
to attack consciousness.

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:15.447
And since then, there's been a real explosion,

00:03:15.447 --> 00:03:17.784
a flowering of scientific work

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:19.048
on consciousness.

00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:21.087
And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.

00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:23.175
But it also has some fundamental

00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:27.000
limitations so far.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.658
The centerpiece

00:03:28.658 --> 00:03:31.478
of the science of consciousness in recent years

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:33.973
has been the search for correlations,

00:03:33.973 --> 00:03:37.102
correlations between certain areas of the brain

00:03:37.102 --> 00:03:41.120
and certain states of consciousness.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.210
We saw some of this kind of work

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.970
from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.246
she presented just a few minutes ago.

00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:50.809
Now we understand much better, for example,

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:53.126
the kinds of brain areas that go along with

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:56.497
the conscious experience of seeing faces

00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:59.617
or of feeling pain

00:03:59.617 --> 00:04:02.106
or of feeling happy.

00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:04.922
But this is still a science of correlations.

00:04:04.922 --> 00:04:08.278
It's not a science of explanations.

00:04:08.278 --> 00:04:10.901
We know that these brain areas

00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:14.825
go along with certain kinds of conscious experience,

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:18.461
but we don't know why they do.

00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:20.786
I like to put this by saying

00:04:20.786 --> 00:04:24.183
that this kind of work from neuroscience

00:04:24.183 --> 00:04:25.929
is answering some of the questions

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:27.734
we want answered about consciousness,

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:31.507
the questions about what certain brain areas do

00:04:31.507 --> 00:04:33.616
and what they correlate with.

00:04:33.616 --> 00:04:36.772
But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.

00:04:36.772 --> 00:04:39.213
No knock on the neuroscientists.

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:41.834
There are no truly easy
problems with consciousness.

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:46.425
But it doesn't address the real mystery

00:04:46.425 --> 00:04:48.355
at the core of this subject:

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:52.575
why is it that all that physical processing in a brain

00:04:52.575 --> 00:04:55.500
should be accompanied by consciousness at all?

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.706
Why is there this inner subjective movie?

00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:01.960
Right now, we don't really have a bead on that.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.993
And you might say,

00:05:03.993 --> 00:05:07.548
let's just give neuroscience a few years.

00:05:07.548 --> 00:05:11.328
It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon

00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:16.210
like traffic jams, like hurricanes,

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.831
like life, and we'll figure it out.

00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:20.902
The classical cases of emergence

00:05:20.902 --> 00:05:24.280
are all cases of emergent behavior,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.627
how a traffic jam behaves,

00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:28.123
how a hurricane functions,

00:05:28.123 --> 00:05:30.316
how a living organism reproduces

00:05:30.316 --> 00:05:33.905
and adapts and metabolizes,

00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:36.188
all questions about objective functioning.

00:05:36.188 --> 00:05:39.010
You could apply that to the human brain

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.519
in explaining some of the behaviors

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:42.792
and the functions of the human brain

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:43.951
as emergent phenomena:

00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:48.349
how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess,

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.239
all these questions about behavior.

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:52.366
But when it comes to consciousness,

00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:54.255
questions about behavior

00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:57.180
are among the easy problems.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.777
When it comes to the hard problem,

00:05:58.777 --> 00:06:01.154
that's the question of why is it

00:06:01.154 --> 00:06:02.965
that all this behavior

00:06:02.965 --> 00:06:05.810
is accompanied by subjective experience?

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.565
And here, the standard paradigm

00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:09.411
of emergence,

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.358
even the standard paradigms of neuroscience,

00:06:12.358 --> 00:06:16.801
don't really, so far, have that much to say.

00:06:16.801 --> 00:06:20.446
Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:24.473
I want a scientific theory of consciousness

00:06:24.473 --> 00:06:26.802
that works,

00:06:26.802 --> 00:06:29.209
and for a long time, I banged my head

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:30.650
against the wall

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.787
looking for a theory of consciousness

00:06:32.787 --> 00:06:34.543
in purely physical terms

00:06:34.543 --> 00:06:35.870
that would work.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.613
But I eventually came to the conclusion

00:06:37.613 --> 00:06:41.798
that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.

00:06:41.798 --> 00:06:43.733
It's a long story,

00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:46.450
but the core idea is just that what you get

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.790
from purely reductionist explanations

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.434
in physical terms, in brain-based terms,

00:06:51.434 --> 00:06:53.549
is stories about the functioning of a system,

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:55.675
its structure, its dynamics,

00:06:55.675 --> 00:06:57.667
the behavior it produces,

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.747
great for solving the easy problems —

00:06:59.747 --> 00:07:02.245
how we behave, how we function —

00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:05.698
but when it comes to subjective experience —

00:07:05.698 --> 00:07:09.259
why does all this feel like
something from the inside? —

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:11.334
that's something fundamentally new,

00:07:11.334 --> 00:07:15.227
and it's always a further question.

00:07:15.227 --> 00:07:20.640
So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.855
We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,

00:07:23.855 --> 00:07:27.455
we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,

00:07:27.455 --> 00:07:30.695
chemistry explains biology,

00:07:30.695 --> 00:07:34.542
biology explains parts of psychology.

00:07:34.542 --> 00:07:36.000
But consciousness

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.771
doesn't seem to fit into this picture.

00:07:38.771 --> 00:07:40.661
On the one hand, it's a datum

00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:42.630
that we're conscious.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.916
On the other hand, we don't know how

00:07:43.916 --> 00:07:47.894
to accommodate it into our
scientific view of the world.

00:07:47.894 --> 00:07:49.841
So I think consciousness right now

00:07:49.841 --> 00:07:52.304
is a kind of anomaly,

00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:54.340
one that we need to integrate

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.240
into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.168
Faced with an anomaly like this,

00:08:00.168 --> 00:08:03.407
radical ideas may be needed,

00:08:03.407 --> 00:08:06.412
and I think that we may need one or two ideas

00:08:06.412 --> 00:08:08.852
that initially seem crazy

00:08:08.852 --> 00:08:11.788
before we can come to grips with consciousness

00:08:11.788 --> 00:08:13.880
scientifically.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.479
Now, there are a few candidates

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:17.975
for what those crazy ideas might be.

00:08:17.975 --> 00:08:22.317
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.

00:08:22.317 --> 00:08:24.714
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem

00:08:24.714 --> 00:08:26.457
of consciousness.

00:08:26.457 --> 00:08:29.820
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.432
involves a kind of illusion or confusion.

00:08:34.432 --> 00:08:36.330
Actually, all we've got to do is explain

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.337
the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,

00:08:39.337 --> 00:08:41.362
and then we've explained everything

00:08:41.362 --> 00:08:43.837
that needs to be explained.

00:08:43.837 --> 00:08:46.446
Well I say, more power to him.

00:08:46.446 --> 00:08:48.460
That's the kind of radical idea

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.384
that we need to explore

00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:52.723
if you want to have a purely reductionist

00:08:52.723 --> 00:08:56.273
brain-based theory of consciousness.

00:08:56.273 --> 00:08:58.344
At the same time, for me and for many other people,

00:08:58.344 --> 00:09:00.171
that view is a bit too close to simply

00:09:00.171 --> 00:09:02.192
denying the datum of consciousness

00:09:02.192 --> 00:09:03.695
to be satisfactory.

00:09:03.695 --> 00:09:06.763
So I go in a different direction.

00:09:06.763 --> 00:09:07.949
In the time remaining,

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:10.948
I want to explore two crazy ideas

00:09:10.948 --> 00:09:14.665
that I think may have some promise.

00:09:14.665 --> 00:09:16.285
The first crazy idea

00:09:16.285 --> 00:09:20.910
is that consciousness is fundamental.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.751
Physicists sometimes take
some aspects of the universe

00:09:23.751 --> 00:09:25.911
as fundamental building blocks:

00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:29.660
space and time and mass.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.270
They postulate fundamental laws governing them,

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.160
like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.470
These fundamental properties and laws

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.687
aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.

00:09:42.687 --> 00:09:45.427
Rather, they're taken as primitive,

00:09:45.427 --> 00:09:48.806
and you build up the world from there.

00:09:48.806 --> 00:09:53.905
Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.

00:09:53.905 --> 00:09:56.362
In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:59.530
that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.881
in terms of the existing fundamentals —

00:10:01.881 --> 00:10:04.950
space, time, mass, Newton's laws —

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.521
so he postulated fundamental laws

00:10:07.521 --> 00:10:09.335
of electromagnetism

00:10:09.335 --> 00:10:11.746
and postulated electric charge

00:10:11.746 --> 00:10:13.514
as a fundamental element

00:10:13.514 --> 00:10:16.473
that those laws govern.

00:10:16.473 --> 00:10:19.756
I think that's the situation we're in

00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:21.366
with consciousness.

00:10:21.366 --> 00:10:23.851
If you can't explain consciousness

00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:26.269
in terms of the existing fundamentals —

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:28.940
space, time, mass, charge —

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.370
then as a matter of logic,
you need to expand the list.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.846
The natural thing to do is to postulate

00:10:34.846 --> 00:10:38.102
consciousness itself as something fundamental,

00:10:38.102 --> 00:10:41.134
a fundamental building block of nature.

00:10:41.134 --> 00:10:44.102
This doesn't mean you suddenly
can't do science with it.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:47.700
This opens up the way for you to do science with it.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.604
What we then need is to study

00:10:49.604 --> 00:10:52.557
the fundamental laws governing consciousness,

00:10:52.557 --> 00:10:54.937
the laws that connect consciousness

00:10:54.937 --> 00:10:57.738
to other fundamentals: space, time, mass,

00:10:57.738 --> 00:11:00.674
physical processes.

00:11:00.674 --> 00:11:02.856
Physicists sometimes say

00:11:02.856 --> 00:11:05.736
that we want fundamental laws so simple

00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:09.538
that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.

00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:11.259
Well I think something like that is the situation

00:11:11.259 --> 00:11:13.127
we're in with consciousness.

00:11:13.127 --> 00:11:15.877
We want to find fundamental laws so simple

00:11:15.877 --> 00:11:17.964
we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.

00:11:17.964 --> 00:11:19.539
We don't know what those laws are yet,

00:11:19.539 --> 00:11:23.566
but that's what we're after.

00:11:23.566 --> 00:11:25.983
The second crazy idea

00:11:25.983 --> 00:11:29.461
is that consciousness might be universal.

00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:32.522
Every system might have some degree

00:11:32.522 --> 00:11:36.247
of consciousness.

00:11:36.247 --> 00:11:39.208
This view is sometimes called panpsychism:

00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:42.210
pan for all, psych for mind,

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.981
every system is conscious,

00:11:43.981 --> 00:11:48.228
not just humans, dogs, mice, flies,

00:11:48.228 --> 00:11:50.805
but even Rob Knight's microbes,

00:11:50.805 --> 00:11:52.992
elementary particles.

00:11:52.992 --> 00:11:55.705
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.

00:11:55.705 --> 00:11:59.484
The idea is not that photons are intelligent

00:11:59.484 --> 00:12:00.561
or thinking.

00:12:00.561 --> 00:12:01.991
It's not that a photon

00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:03.436
is wracked with angst

00:12:03.436 --> 00:12:06.728
because it's thinking, "Aww, I'm always
buzzing around near the speed of light.

00:12:06.728 --> 00:12:09.720
I never get to slow down and smell the roses."

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.864
No, not like that.

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:14.912
But the thought is maybe photons might have

00:12:14.912 --> 00:12:17.535
some element of raw, subjective feeling,

00:12:17.535 --> 00:12:21.687
some primitive precursor to consciousness.

00:12:21.687 --> 00:12:24.541
This may sound a bit kooky to you.

00:12:24.541 --> 00:12:27.324
I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?

00:12:27.324 --> 00:12:30.884
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea,

00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:33.030
that consciousness is fundamental.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:37.405
If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,

00:12:37.405 --> 00:12:40.070
it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.970
the way they are.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.919
It's also worth noting that although the idea

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:45.943
seems counterintuitive to us,

00:12:45.943 --> 00:12:48.687
it's much less counterintuitive to people

00:12:48.687 --> 00:12:50.418
from different cultures,

00:12:50.418 --> 00:12:51.938
where the human mind is seen as much more

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:55.010
continuous with nature.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.744
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that

00:12:58.744 --> 00:13:00.753
perhaps the most simple and powerful way

00:13:00.753 --> 00:13:02.987
to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness

00:13:02.987 --> 00:13:04.967
to physical processing

00:13:04.967 --> 00:13:08.062
is to link consciousness to information.

00:13:08.062 --> 00:13:10.073
Wherever there's information processing,

00:13:10.073 --> 00:13:11.138
there's consciousness.

00:13:11.138 --> 00:13:13.678
Complex information processing, like in a human,

00:13:13.688 --> 00:13:15.220
complex consciousness.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.349
Simple information processing,

00:13:17.349 --> 00:13:19.307
simple consciousness.

00:13:19.307 --> 00:13:21.638
A really exciting thing is in recent years

00:13:21.638 --> 00:13:24.903
a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,

00:13:24.903 --> 00:13:26.146
has taken this kind of theory

00:13:26.146 --> 00:13:28.221
and developed it rigorously

00:13:28.221 --> 00:13:30.070
with a mathematical theory.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.587
He has a mathematical measure

00:13:31.587 --> 00:13:33.317
of information integration

00:13:33.317 --> 00:13:35.236
which he calls phi,

00:13:35.236 --> 00:13:36.843
measuring the amount of information

00:13:36.843 --> 00:13:38.463
integrated in a system.

00:13:38.463 --> 00:13:40.832
And he supposes that phi goes along

00:13:40.832 --> 00:13:42.270
with consciousness.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.591
So in a human brain,

00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:46.110
incredibly large amount of information integration,

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.144
high degree of phi,

00:13:48.144 --> 00:13:49.693
a whole lot of consciousness.

00:13:49.693 --> 00:13:53.386
In a mouse, medium degree
of information integration,

00:13:53.386 --> 00:13:54.405
still pretty significant,

00:13:54.405 --> 00:13:56.430
pretty serious amount of consciousness.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.695
But as you go down to worms,

00:13:58.695 --> 00:14:02.172
microbes, particles,

00:14:02.172 --> 00:14:03.706
the amount of phi falls off.

00:14:03.706 --> 00:14:06.139
The amount of information integration falls off,

00:14:06.139 --> 00:14:07.587
but it's still non-zero.

00:14:07.587 --> 00:14:09.526
On Tononi's theory,

00:14:09.526 --> 00:14:11.733
there's still going to be a non-zero degree

00:14:11.733 --> 00:14:13.562
of consciousness.

00:14:13.562 --> 00:14:16.101
In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law

00:14:16.101 --> 00:14:19.485
of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.

00:14:19.485 --> 00:14:22.107
Now, I don't know if this theory is right,

00:14:22.107 --> 00:14:25.318
but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now

00:14:25.318 --> 00:14:26.704
in the science of consciousness,

00:14:26.704 --> 00:14:28.935
and it's been used to integrate a whole range

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:31.322
of scientific data,

00:14:31.322 --> 00:14:33.565
and it does have a nice property
that it is in fact simple enough

00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:37.060
you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.685
Another final motivation is that

00:14:39.685 --> 00:14:41.736
panpsychism might help us to integrate

00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:44.950
consciousness into the physical world.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.127
Physicists and philosophers have often observed

00:14:48.127 --> 00:14:50.568
that physics is curiously abstract.

00:14:50.568 --> 00:14:52.716
It describes the structure of reality

00:14:52.716 --> 00:14:54.800
using a bunch of equations,

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.824
but it doesn't tell us about the reality

00:14:57.824 --> 00:14:59.392
that underlies it.

00:14:59.392 --> 00:15:01.289
As Stephen Hawking puts it,

00:15:01.289 --> 00:15:05.343
what puts the fire into the equations?

00:15:05.343 --> 00:15:07.961
Well, on the panpsychist view,

00:15:07.961 --> 00:15:10.600
you can leave the equations of physics as they are,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.164
but you can take them to be describing

00:15:12.164 --> 00:15:13.838
the flux of consciousness.

00:15:13.838 --> 00:15:15.876
That's what physics really is ultimately doing,

00:15:15.876 --> 00:15:18.205
describing the flux of consciousness.

00:15:18.205 --> 00:15:19.858
On this view, it's consciousness

00:15:19.858 --> 00:15:24.104
that puts the fire into the equations.

00:15:24.104 --> 00:15:25.764
On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle

00:15:25.764 --> 00:15:27.440
outside the physical world

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.858
as some kind of extra.

00:15:28.858 --> 00:15:32.314
It's there right at its heart.

00:15:32.314 --> 00:15:35.188
This view, I think, the panpsychist view,

00:15:35.188 --> 00:15:38.489
has the potential to transfigure our relationship

00:15:38.489 --> 00:15:39.984
to nature,

00:15:39.984 --> 00:15:42.219
and it may have some pretty serious social

00:15:42.219 --> 00:15:45.912
and ethical consequences.

00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:48.071
Some of these may be counterintuitive.

00:15:48.071 --> 00:15:51.142
I used to think I shouldn't eat anything

00:15:51.142 --> 00:15:53.604
which is conscious,

00:15:53.604 --> 00:15:56.208
so therefore I should be vegetarian.

00:15:56.208 --> 00:15:58.775
Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,

00:15:58.775 --> 00:16:01.505
you're going to go very hungry.

00:16:01.505 --> 00:16:02.793
So I think when you think about it,

00:16:02.793 --> 00:16:04.960
this tends to transfigure your views,

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.203
whereas what matters for ethical purposes

00:16:07.203 --> 00:16:08.477
and moral considerations,

00:16:08.477 --> 00:16:11.554
not so much the fact of consciousness,

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:15.510
but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.448
It's also natural to ask about consciousness

00:16:17.448 --> 00:16:20.498
in other systems, like computers.

00:16:20.498 --> 00:16:22.287
What about the artificially intelligent system

00:16:22.287 --> 00:16:25.729
in the movie "Her," Samantha?

00:16:25.729 --> 00:16:27.129
Is she conscious?

00:16:27.129 --> 00:16:28.560
Well, if you take the informational,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.740
panpsychist view,

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.211
she certainly has complicated information processing

00:16:33.211 --> 00:16:34.632
and integration,

00:16:34.632 --> 00:16:37.299
so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.

00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:40.237
If that's right, it raises pretty serious

00:16:40.237 --> 00:16:42.602
ethical issues about both the ethics

00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:46.123
of developing intelligent computer systems

00:16:46.123 --> 00:16:48.859
and the ethics of turning them off.

00:16:48.859 --> 00:16:51.359
Finally, you might ask about the consciousness

00:16:51.359 --> 00:16:53.241
of whole groups,

00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:55.078
the planet.

00:16:55.078 --> 00:16:58.001
Does Canada have its own consciousness?

00:16:58.001 --> 00:17:00.100
Or at a more local level,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.308
does an integrated group

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:03.571
like the audience at a TED conference,

00:17:03.571 --> 00:17:07.020
are we right now having a
collective TED consciousness,

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.513
an inner movie

00:17:08.513 --> 00:17:11.319
for this collective TED group

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.999
which is distinct from the inner movies

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:14.088
of each of our parts?

00:17:14.088 --> 00:17:16.243
I don't know the answer to that question,

00:17:16.253 --> 00:17:17.624
but I think it's at least one

00:17:17.624 --> 00:17:20.098
worth taking seriously.

00:17:20.098 --> 00:17:22.435
Okay, so this panpsychist vision,

00:17:22.435 --> 00:17:24.248
it is a radical one,

00:17:24.248 --> 00:17:26.462
and I don't know that it's correct.

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.315
I'm actually more confident about

00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:29.948
the first crazy idea,

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:32.117
that consciousness is fundamental,

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:33.920
than about the second one,

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.141
that it's universal.

00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:38.219
I mean, the view raises any number of questions,

00:17:38.219 --> 00:17:39.760
has any number of challenges,

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.120
like how do those little bits

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.860
of consciousness add up

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.157
to the kind of complex consciousness

00:17:45.157 --> 00:17:47.480
we know and love.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.940
If we can answer those questions,

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.445
then I think we're going to be well on our way

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:53.532
to a serious theory of consciousness.

00:17:53.532 --> 00:17:56.920
If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.764
in science and philosophy.

00:17:58.764 --> 00:18:02.209
We can't expect to solve it overnight.

00:18:02.209 --> 00:18:05.749
But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.

00:18:05.749 --> 00:18:08.736
Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think,

00:18:08.736 --> 00:18:11.188
both to understanding the universe

00:18:11.188 --> 00:18:13.718
and to understanding ourselves.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:16.621
It may just take the right crazy idea.

00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:18.612
Thank you.

00:18:18.612 --> 00:18:20.300
(Applause)
