WEBVTT

00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:02.855
The first time I stood
in the operating room

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:04.727
and watched a real surgery,

00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:07.302
I had no idea what to expect.

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:09.277
I was a college student in engineering.

00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:11.477
I thought it was going to be like on TV.

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.382
Ominous music playing in the background,

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:16.381
beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon's face.

00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:18.541
But it wasn't like that at all.

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.140
There was music playing on this day,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.862
I think it was Madonna's greatest hits. (Laughter)

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:24.989
And there was plenty of conversation,

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.989
not just about the patient's heart rate,

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.762
but about sports and weekend plans.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.698
And since then, the more surgeries I watched,

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.525
the more I realized this is how it is.

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:36.278
In some weird way, it's just
another day at the office.

00:00:36.278 --> 00:00:38.183
But every so often

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:40.281
the music gets turned down,

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:41.711
everyone stops talking,

00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:44.695
and stares at exactly the same thing.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:46.855
And that's when you know
that something absolutely critical

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:49.295
and dangerous is happening.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:50.311
The first time I saw that

00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:51.543
I was watching a type of surgery

00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:53.832
called laparoscopic surgery

00:00:53.832 --> 00:00:56.390
And for those of you who are unfamiliar,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.783
laparoscopic surgery, instead of the large

00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:01.277
open incision you might
be used to with surgery,

00:01:01.277 --> 00:01:03.485
a laparoscopic surgery
is where the surgeon creates

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:06.502
these three or more small
incisions in the patient.

00:01:06.502 --> 00:01:09.368
And then inserts these long, thin instruments

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:10.482
and a camera,

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:14.333
and actually does the procedure inside the patient.

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.925
This is great because there's
much less risk of infection,

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:20.085
much less pain, shorter recovery time.

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:22.677
But there is a trade-off,

00:01:22.677 --> 00:01:24.461
because these incisions are created

00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.959
with a long, pointed device

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.423
called a trocar.

00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:30.617
And the way the surgeon uses this device

00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:32.033
is that he takes it

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.000
and he presses it into the abdomen

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.255
until it punctures through.

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:40.327
And now the reason why 
everyone in the operating room

00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:42.974
was staring at that device on that day

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:46.205
was because he had to be absolutely careful

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:47.672
not to plunge it through

00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:51.613
and puncture it into the organs 
and blood vessels below.

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:53.452
But this problem should seem 
pretty familiar to all of you

00:01:53.452 --> 00:01:56.373
because I'm pretty sure 
you've seen it somewhere else.

00:01:56.373 --> 00:01:58.165
(Laughter)

00:01:58.165 --> 00:01:59.821
Remember this?

00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:03.937
(Applause)

00:02:03.937 --> 00:02:05.813
You knew that at any second

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:07.693
that straw was going to plunge through,

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.278
and you didn't know if it was 
going to go out the other side

00:02:09.278 --> 00:02:10.581
and straight into your hand,

00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:12.277
or if you were going to
get juice everywhere,

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:15.580
but you were terrified. Right?

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.556
Every single time you did this,

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:20.112
you experienced the same
fundamental physics

00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:23.192
that I was watching in the operating room that day.

00:02:23.192 --> 00:02:25.738
And it turns out it really is a problem.

00:02:25.738 --> 00:02:28.530
In 2003, the FDA actually came out and said

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.907
that trocar incisions might 
be the most dangerous step

00:02:31.907 --> 00:02:33.923
in minimally invasive surgery.

00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:36.363
Again in 2009, we see a paper that says

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:38.547
that trocars account for over half

00:02:38.547 --> 00:02:42.234
of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery.

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:43.376
And, oh by the way,

00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:46.970
this hasn't changed for 25 years.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.500
So when I got to graduate school,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.368
this is what I wanted to work on.

00:02:50.368 --> 00:02:52.176
I was trying to explain to a friend of mine

00:02:52.176 --> 00:02:54.291
what exactly I was spending my time doing,

00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:56.107
and I said,

00:02:56.107 --> 00:02:58.283
"It's like when you're drilling through a wall

00:02:58.283 --> 00:03:01.483
to hang something in your apartment.

00:03:01.483 --> 00:03:05.395
There's that moment when the drill
first punctures through the wall

00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:09.047
and there's this plunge. Right?

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.430
And he looked at me and he said,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.901
"You mean like when they drill 
into people's brains?"

00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.233
And I said, "Excuse me?" (Laughter)

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.281
And then I looked it up and they
do drill into people's brains.

00:03:22.281 --> 00:03:24.345
A lot of neurosurgical procedures

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:28.127
actually start with a drill
incision through the skull.

00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:29.912
And if the surgeon isn't careful,

00:03:29.912 --> 00:03:33.496
he can plunge directly into the brain.

00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:35.662
So this is the moment when I started thinking,

00:03:35.662 --> 00:03:38.970
okay, cranial drilling, laparoscopic surgery,

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.634
why not other areas of medicine?

00:03:40.634 --> 00:03:42.578
Because think about it, when was
the last time you went to the doctor

00:03:42.578 --> 00:03:45.325
and you didn't get stuck with something? Right?

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.642
So the truth is

00:03:46.642 --> 00:03:49.194
in medicine puncture is everywhere.

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:51.986
And here are just a couple
of the procedures that I've found

00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:55.195
that involve some tissue puncture step.

00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:57.274
And if we take just three of them —

00:03:57.274 --> 00:04:01.370
laparoscopic surgery, 
epidurals, and cranial drilling —

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.349
these procedures account 
for over 30,000 complications

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.200
every year in this country alone.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.915
I call that a problem worth solving.

00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:13.240
So let's take a look at some of the devices

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.744
that are used in these types of procedures.

00:04:15.744 --> 00:04:18.969
I mentioned epidurals. This is an epidural needle.

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.286
It's used to puncture through 
the ligaments in the spine

00:04:21.286 --> 00:04:23.725
and deliver anesthesia during childbirth.

00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:26.278
Here's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools.

00:04:26.278 --> 00:04:28.214
These are actually used
to burrow into the bone

00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:31.714
and collect bone marrow
or sample bone lesions.

00:04:31.714 --> 00:04:33.624
Here's a bayonette from the Civil War.

00:04:33.624 --> 00:04:36.640
(Laughter)

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.233
If I had told you it was a 
medical puncture device

00:04:39.233 --> 00:04:41.449
you probably would have believed me.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.642
Because what's the difference?

00:04:43.642 --> 00:04:45.577
So, the more I did this research

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.161
the more I thought there has to be

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.190
a better way to do this.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.609
And for me the key to this problem

00:04:51.609 --> 00:04:54.020
is that all these different puncture devices

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.822
share a common set of fundamental physics.

00:04:57.822 --> 00:04:59.374
So what are those physics?

00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:00.966
Let's go back to drilling through a wall.

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:04.598
So you're applying a force 
on a drill towards the wall.

00:05:04.598 --> 00:05:07.942
And Newton says the wall
is going to apply force back,

00:05:07.942 --> 00:05:09.207
equal and opposite.

00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:11.170
So, as you drill through the wall,

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.100
those forces balance.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.641
But then there's that moment

00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.777
when the drill first punctures
through the other side of the wall,

00:05:16.777 --> 00:05:19.633
and right at that moment 
the wall can't push back anymore.

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:23.100
But your brain hasn't reacted 
to that change in force.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.161
So for that millisecond,

00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:26.793
or however long it takes you 
to react, you're still pushing,

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.337
and that unbalanced force 
causes an acceleration,

00:05:29.337 --> 00:05:32.449
and that is the plunge.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.353
But what if right at the moment of puncture

00:05:36.353 --> 00:05:37.977
you could pull that tip back,

00:05:37.977 --> 00:05:40.990
actually oppose the forward acceleration?

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.127
That's what I set out to do.

00:05:43.127 --> 00:05:44.447
So imagine you have a device

00:05:44.447 --> 00:05:47.647
and it's got some kind of sharp tip 
to cut through tissue.

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:50.860
What's the simplest way 
you could pull that tip back?

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.671
I chose a spring.

00:05:52.671 --> 00:05:55.255
So when you extend that spring, 
you extend that tip out

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:57.470
so it's ready to puncture tissue,

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.910
the spring wants to pull the tip back.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.663
How do you keep the tip in place

00:06:00.663 --> 00:06:03.127
until the moment of puncture?

00:06:03.127 --> 00:06:05.550
I used this mechanism.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.111
When the tip of the device
is pressed against tissue,

00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:11.951
the mechanism expands outwards 
and wedges in place against the wall.

00:06:11.951 --> 00:06:13.655
And the friction that's generated

00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:16.847
locks it in place and prevents
the spring from retracting the tip.

00:06:16.847 --> 00:06:18.734
But right at the moment of puncture,

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:20.798
the tissue can't push back
on the tip anymore.

00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:23.980
So the mechanism unlocks 
and the spring retracts the tip.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.630
Let me show you that 
happening in slow motion.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.278
This is about 2,000 frames a second,

00:06:27.278 --> 00:06:29.150
and I'd like you to notice the tip

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.778
that's right there on the bottom, 
about to puncture through tissue.

00:06:31.778 --> 00:06:34.839
And you'll see that 
right at the moment of puncture,

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.892
right there, the mechanism unlocks 
and retracts that tip back.

00:06:39.892 --> 00:06:42.236
I want to show it to you again, a little closer up.

00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:44.428
You're going to see the sharp bladed tip,

00:06:44.428 --> 00:06:46.420
and right when it punctures 
that rubber membrane

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.572
it's going to disappear
into this white blunt sheath.

00:06:50.572 --> 00:06:52.437
Right there.

00:06:52.437 --> 00:06:57.101
That happens within four 100ths 
of a second after puncture.

00:06:57.101 --> 00:07:00.901
And because this device is designed
to address the physics of puncture

00:07:00.901 --> 00:07:02.733
and not the specifics of cranial drilling

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:04.940
or laparoscopic surgery, 
or another procedure,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.597
it's applicable across these
different medical disciplines

00:07:07.597 --> 00:07:10.628
and across different length scales.

00:07:10.628 --> 00:07:12.741
But it didn't always look like this.

00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:14.926
This was my first prototype.

00:07:14.926 --> 00:07:17.568
Yes, those are popsicle sticks,

00:07:17.568 --> 00:07:19.470
and there's a rubber band at the top.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.870
It took about 30 minutes to do this, but it worked.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.566
And it proved to me that my idea worked

00:07:24.566 --> 00:07:27.958
and it justified the next couple
years of work on this project.

00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.766
I worked on this because

00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:31.429
this problem really fascinated me.

00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:33.558
It kept me up at night.

00:07:33.558 --> 00:07:36.540
But I think it should fascinate you too,

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.442
because I said puncture is everywhere.

00:07:38.442 --> 00:07:42.706
That means at some point 
it's going to be your problem too.

00:07:42.706 --> 00:07:44.266
That first day in the operating room

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:47.250
I never expected to find myself 
on the other end of a trocar.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.140
But last year, I got appendicitis 
when I was visiting Greece.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.970
So I was in the hospital in Athens,

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.458
and the surgeon was telling me

00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:56.594
he was going to perform 
a laparoscopic surgery.

00:07:56.594 --> 00:07:59.346
He was going to remove my appendix 
through these tiny incisions,

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:02.040
and he was talking about what
I could expect for the recovery,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.482
and what was going to happen.

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:05.900
He said, "Do you have any questions?"
And I said, "Just one, doc.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.374
What kind of trocar do you use?"

00:08:09.374 --> 00:08:12.879
So my favorite quote 
about laparoscopic surgery

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:15.525
comes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus:

00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:19.189
"It is puncture itself that causes risk."

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:22.325
That's my favorite quote 
because H.C. Jacobaeus

00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:26.365
was the first person to ever perform 
laparoscopic surgery on humans,

00:08:26.365 --> 00:08:29.797
and he wrote that in 1912.

00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:35.581
This is a problem that's been injuring and
even killing people for over 100 years.

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:37.815
So it's easy to think that for
every major problem out there

00:08:37.815 --> 00:08:41.751
there's some team of experts 
working around the clock to solve it.

00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:45.100
The truth is that's not always the case.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.545
We have to be better at finding those problems

00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:50.313
and finding ways to solve them.

00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:53.569
So if you come across a problem that grabs you,

00:08:53.569 --> 00:08:55.450
let it keep you up at night.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.593
Allow yourself to be fascinated,

00:08:57.593 --> 00:09:00.505
because there are so many lives to save.

00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:03.904
(Applause)
