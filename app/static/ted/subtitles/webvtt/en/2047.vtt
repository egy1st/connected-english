00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.595
I was born in Taiwan.

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:04.419
I grew up surrounded by

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:07.119
different types of hardware stores,

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:09.467
and I like going to night markets.

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:11.307
I love the energy of the night markets,

00:00:11.307 --> 00:00:13.859
the colors, the lights, the toys,

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.302
and all the unexpected things I find every time I go,

00:00:17.302 --> 00:00:20.672
things like watermelon with straw antennas

00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:24.494
or puppies with mohawks.

00:00:24.494 --> 00:00:27.304
When I was growing up, I liked taking toys apart,

00:00:27.304 --> 00:00:29.328
any kind of toys I'd find around the house,

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.562
like my brother's BB gun when he's not home.

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.580
I also liked to make environments

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.668
for people to explore and play.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.618
In these early installations,

00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:40.146
I would take plastic sheets, plastic bags,

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:41.986
and things I would find in the hardware store

00:00:41.986 --> 00:00:43.202
or around the house.

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:45.938
I would take things like highlighter pen,

00:00:45.938 --> 00:00:49.390
mix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.902
creating these glowing circulatory systems

00:00:51.902 --> 00:00:54.286
for people to walk through and enjoy.

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:56.794
I like these materials because of the way they look,

00:00:56.794 --> 00:01:00.090
the way they feel, and they're very affordable.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.916
I also liked to make devices
that work with body parts.

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:05.094
I would take camera LED lights

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:07.235
and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:09.394
and I would videotape my belly button,

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:10.416
get a different perspective,

00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:12.778
and see what it does.

00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:14.940
(Laughter)

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.522
I also like to modify household appliances.

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:18.820
This is an automatic night light.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.434
Some of you might have them at home.

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:22.066
I would cut out the light sensor,

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.970
add an extension line,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.466
and use modeling clay,

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.242
stick it onto the television,

00:01:27.242 --> 00:01:29.254
and then I would videotape my eye,

00:01:29.254 --> 00:01:31.122
and using the dark part of my eye

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:33.002
tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time,

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:34.754
so you turn on the lightbulb.

00:01:34.754 --> 00:01:36.674
The white of the eye and the eyelid

00:01:36.674 --> 00:01:38.866
will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime,

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.632
and it will shut off the light.

00:01:41.632 --> 00:01:43.720
I wanted to collect more different types of eyes,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.464
so I built this device using bicycle helmets,

00:01:46.464 --> 00:01:48.880
some lightbulbs and television sets.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.271
It would be easier for other
people to wear the helmet

00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:53.596
and record their eyes.

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:56.718
This device allows me to symbolically

00:01:56.718 --> 00:01:58.262
extract other people's eyes,

00:01:58.262 --> 00:02:00.159
so I have a diversity of eyes to use

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.289
for my other sculptures.

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.589
This sculpture has four eyes.

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.757
Each eye is controlling a different device.

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:16.237
This eye is turning itself around in a television.

00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:18.653
This eye is inflating a plastic tube.

00:02:18.653 --> 00:02:22.229
This eye is watching a video
of another piece being made.

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:26.191
And these two eyes are activating glowing water.

00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:28.173
Many of these pieces are later on shown

00:02:28.173 --> 00:02:30.517
in museums, biennials, triennial exhibitions

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.867
around the world.

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:35.230
I love science and biology.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.717
In 2007, I was doing a research fellowship

00:02:37.717 --> 00:02:39.765
at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum

00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:42.573
looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean.

00:02:42.573 --> 00:02:45.677
I love these creatures. I love the
way they look, the way they feel.

00:02:45.677 --> 00:02:48.535
They're soft, they're slimy,

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.725
and I was fascinated by the way they use light

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:51.950
in their environment,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.020
either to attract mates, for self-defense,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.818
or to attract food.

00:02:56.818 --> 00:02:59.237
This research inspired my
work in many different ways,

00:02:59.237 --> 00:03:03.501
things like movement or different light patterns.

00:03:06.184 --> 00:03:07.621
So I started gathering a lot of

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:10.352
different types of material in my studio

00:03:10.352 --> 00:03:11.547
and just experimenting

00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:13.371
and trying this out, trying that out,

00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:15.995
and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.259
I used a lot of computer cooling fans

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.755
and just kind of put them
together and see what happens.

00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:23.955
This is an 8,000-square-foot installation

00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:25.363
composed of many different creatures,

00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:28.846
some hanging from the ceiling
and some resting on the floor.

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:30.134
From afar, they look alien-like,

00:03:30.134 --> 00:03:31.802
but when you look closer,

00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:33.330
they're all made out of black garbage bags

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.950
or Tupperware containers.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.910
I'd like to share with you how ordinary things

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.418
can become something magical and wondrous.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.986
(Applause)

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:54.735
Thank you.

00:04:54.735 --> 00:04:57.865
(Applause)
