00:00:00.632 --> 00:00:03.737
I'd like to introduce you to an organism:

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:07.193
a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.

00:00:07.193 --> 00:00:10.015
It's a mold with an identity
crisis, because it's not a mold,

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:11.945
so let's get that straight to start with.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.481
It is one of 700 known slime molds

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.618
belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba.

00:00:16.618 --> 00:00:19.241
It is a single-celled organism, a cell,

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:21.481
that joins together with other cells

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.713
to form a mass super-cell

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:25.953
to maximize its resources.

00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:28.113
So within a slime mold you might find thousands

00:00:28.113 --> 00:00:30.360
or millions of nuclei,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.121
all sharing a cell wall,

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:35.229
all operating as one entity.

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:36.833
In its natural habitat,

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:39.629
you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands,

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.330
eating rotting vegetation,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.870
but you might equally find it

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.412
in research laboratories,

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:50.614
classrooms, and even artists' studios.

00:00:50.614 --> 00:00:53.549
I first came across the slime
mold about five years ago.

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.106
A microbiologist friend of mine

00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:58.230
gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.238
and told me to go home and play with it.

00:01:01.238 --> 00:01:03.245
The only instructions I was given,

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:05.029
that it likes it dark and damp

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:09.360
and its favorite food is porridge oats.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.378
I'm an artist who's worked for many years

00:01:11.378 --> 00:01:14.225
with biology, with scientific processes,

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:17.236
so living material is not uncommon for me.

00:01:17.236 --> 00:01:19.341
I've worked with plants, bacteria,

00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:20.860
cuttlefish, fruit flies.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.462
So I was keen to get my new collaborator home

00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:24.838
to see what it could do.

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:28.040
So I took it home and I watched.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.810
I fed it a varied diet.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.734
I observed as it networked.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:35.010
It formed a connection between food sources.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.848
I watched it leave a trail behind it,

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:39.607
indicating where it had been.

00:01:39.607 --> 00:01:42.555
And I noticed that when it was
fed up with one petri dish,

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:45.534
it would escape and find a better home.

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:47.262
I captured my observations

00:01:47.262 --> 00:01:49.022
through time-lapse photography.

00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:51.860
Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.441
so it's not really ideal for live viewing

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:57.294
unless there's some form of
really extreme meditation,

00:01:57.294 --> 00:01:59.822
but through the time lapse,

00:01:59.822 --> 00:02:02.918
I could observe some really interesting behaviors.

00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:06.418
For instance, having fed on a nice pile of oats,

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:10.862
the slime mold goes off to explore new territories

00:02:10.862 --> 00:02:13.594
in different directions simultaneously.

00:02:13.594 --> 00:02:15.833
When it meets itself,

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:17.700
it knows it's already there,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.654
it recognizes it's there,

00:02:19.654 --> 00:02:21.201
and instead retreats back

00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:24.881
and grows in other directions.

00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:27.205
I was quite impressed by this feat,

00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:30.755
at how what was essentially
just a bag of cellular slime

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:33.985
could somehow map its territory,

00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:37.457
know itself, and move with seeming intention.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:41.110
I found countless scientific studies,

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.155
research papers, journal articles,

00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:47.379
all citing incredible work with this one organism,

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.343
and I'm going to share a few of those with you.

00:02:49.343 --> 00:02:52.303
For example, a team in Hokkaido University in Japan

00:02:52.303 --> 00:02:54.335
filled a maze with slime mold.

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:56.431
It joined together and formed a mass cell.

00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:58.783
They introduced food at two points,

00:02:58.783 --> 00:02:59.981
oats of course,

00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:01.627
and it formed a connection

00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:03.041
between the food.

00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.525
It retracted from empty areas and dead ends.

00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:08.335
There are four possible routes through this maze,

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:10.440
yet time and time again,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.607
the slime mold established the shortest

00:03:12.607 --> 00:03:15.060
and the most efficient route.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.311
Quite clever.

00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:18.050
The conclusion from their experiment

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.047
was that the slime mold had
a primitive form of intelligence.

00:03:21.047 --> 00:03:24.910
Another study exposed cold air at
regular intervals to the slime mold.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.255
It didn't like it. It doesn't like it cold.

00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:28.448
It doesn't like it dry.

00:03:28.448 --> 00:03:30.563
They did this at repeat intervals,

00:03:30.563 --> 00:03:32.221
and each time, the slime mold

00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:35.351
slowed down its growth in response.

00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.195
However, at the next interval,

00:03:37.195 --> 00:03:40.019
the researchers didn't put the cold air on,

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.313
yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation

00:03:43.313 --> 00:03:44.649
of it happening.

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:47.175
It somehow knew that it was about the time

00:03:47.175 --> 00:03:49.131
for the cold air that it didn't like.

00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:50.820
The conclusion from their experiment

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.090
was that the slime mold was able to learn.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.321
A third experiment:

00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:57.088
the slime mold was invited

00:03:57.088 --> 00:04:01.280
to explore a territory covered in oats.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.327
It fans out in a branching pattern.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.975
As it goes, each food node it finds,

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:09.675
it forms a network, a connection to,

00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:11.423
and keeps foraging.

00:04:11.423 --> 00:04:13.864
After 26 hours, it established

00:04:13.864 --> 00:04:15.481
quite a firm network

00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:17.271
between the different oats.

00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:19.091
Now there's nothing remarkable in this

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.503
until you learn that the center oat that it started from

00:04:21.503 --> 00:04:23.517
represents the city of Tokyo,

00:04:23.517 --> 00:04:27.583
and the surrounding oats are
suburban railway stations.

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:30.064
The slime mold had replicated

00:04:30.064 --> 00:04:32.480
the Tokyo transport network

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.135
— (Laughter) —

00:04:34.135 --> 00:04:37.130
a complex system developed over time

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.030
by community dwellings, civil
engineering, urban planning.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.303
What had taken us well over 100 years

00:04:43.303 --> 00:04:46.469
took the slime mold just over a day.

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.122
The conclusion from their experiment

00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:50.632
was that the slime mold can form efficient networks

00:04:50.632 --> 00:04:53.255
and solve the traveling salesman problem.

00:04:53.255 --> 00:04:55.519
It is a biological computer.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:58.143
As such, it has been mathematically modeled,

00:04:58.143 --> 00:04:59.804
algorithmically analyzed.

00:04:59.804 --> 00:05:02.509
It's been sonified, replicated, simulated.

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.479
World over, teams of researchers

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.449
are decoding its biological principles

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.590
to understand its computational rules

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.844
and applying that learning
to the fields of electronics,

00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:15.080
programming and robotics.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.234
So the question is,

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:19.254
how does this thing work?

00:05:19.254 --> 00:05:21.414
It doesn't have a central nervous system.

00:05:21.414 --> 00:05:23.112
It doesn't have a brain,

00:05:23.112 --> 00:05:24.940
yet it can perform behaviors

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.928
that we associate with brain function.

00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:28.836
It can learn, it can remember,

00:05:28.836 --> 00:05:31.593
it can solve problems, it can make decisions.

00:05:31.593 --> 00:05:34.308
So where does that intelligence lie?

00:05:34.308 --> 00:05:36.800
So this is a microscopy, a video I shot,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.453
and it's about 100 times magnification,

00:05:39.453 --> 00:05:42.320
sped up about 20 times,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.106
and inside the slime mold,

00:05:44.106 --> 00:05:47.548
there is a rhythmic pulsing flow,

00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:49.716
a vein-like structure carrying

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:53.488
cellular material, nutrients and chemical information

00:05:53.488 --> 00:05:55.346
through the cell,

00:05:55.346 --> 00:05:58.964
streaming first in one direction
and then back in another.

00:05:58.964 --> 00:06:02.781
And it is this continuous, synchronous oscillation

00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:05.037
within the cell that allows it to form

00:06:05.037 --> 00:06:08.019
quite a complex understanding of its environment,

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:11.388
but without any large-scale control center.

00:06:11.388 --> 00:06:13.969
This is where its intelligence lies.

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:17.213
So it's not just academic researchers

00:06:17.213 --> 00:06:19.857
in universities that are interested in this organism.

00:06:19.857 --> 00:06:22.730
A few years ago, I set up SliMoCo,

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.070
the Slime Mould Collective.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.293
It's an online, open, democratic network

00:06:28.293 --> 00:06:30.389
for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.118
to share knowledge and experimentation

00:06:33.118 --> 00:06:36.086
across disciplinary divides

00:06:36.086 --> 00:06:39.781
and across academic divides.

00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:43.221
The Slime Mould Collective
membership is self-selecting.

00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:46.017
People have found the collective

00:06:46.017 --> 00:06:49.715
as the slime mold finds the oats.

00:06:49.715 --> 00:06:51.408
And it comprises of scientists

00:06:51.408 --> 00:06:52.967
and computer scientists and researchers

00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:55.254
but also artists like me,

00:06:55.254 --> 00:07:00.346
architects, designers, writers, activists, you name it.

00:07:00.346 --> 00:07:04.529
It's a very interesting, eclectic membership.

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:05.866
Just a few examples:

00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:08.991
an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum;

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:10.563
a collaborative team

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:14.341
who are combining biological and electronic design

00:07:14.341 --> 00:07:17.486
with 3D printing technologies in a workshop;

00:07:17.486 --> 00:07:19.620
another artist who is using the slime mold

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.720
as a way of engaging a community

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.724
to map their area.

00:07:24.724 --> 00:07:26.886
Here, the slime mold is being used directly

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:29.764
as a biological tool, but metaphorically

00:07:29.764 --> 00:07:31.748
as a symbol for ways of talking

00:07:31.748 --> 00:07:35.602
about social cohesion, communication

00:07:35.602 --> 00:07:37.466
and cooperation.

00:07:37.466 --> 00:07:39.976
Other public engagement activities,

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:41.994
I run lots of slime mold workshops,

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:44.456
a creative way of engaging with the organism.

00:07:44.456 --> 00:07:46.140
So people are invited to come and learn

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.036
about what amazing things it can do,

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:50.682
and they design their own petri dish experiment,

00:07:50.682 --> 00:07:52.998
an environment for the slime mold to navigate

00:07:52.998 --> 00:07:54.636
so they can test its properties.

00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:57.080
Everybody takes home a new pet

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.020
and is invited to post their results

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.438
on the Slime Mould Collective.

00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:03.886
And the collective has enabled me

00:08:03.886 --> 00:08:06.248
to form collaborations

00:08:06.248 --> 00:08:08.841
with a whole array of interesting people.

00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:10.434
I've been working with filmmakers

00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:13.900
on a feature-length slime mold documentary,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.558
and I stress feature-length,

00:08:16.558 --> 00:08:18.267
which is in the final stages of edit

00:08:18.267 --> 00:08:21.293
and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon.

00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:22.773
(Laughter)

00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:26.108
It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is

00:08:26.108 --> 00:08:28.981
the world's first human slime mold experiment.

00:08:28.981 --> 00:08:31.953
This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year.

00:08:31.953 --> 00:08:36.644
We invited people to become
slime mold for half an hour.

00:08:36.644 --> 00:08:39.985
So we essentially tied people together

00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:42.309
so they were a giant cell,

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.153
and invited them to follow slime mold rules.

00:08:45.153 --> 00:08:48.584
You have to communicate through oscillations,

00:08:48.584 --> 00:08:49.880
no speaking.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.813
You have to operate as one entity, one mass cell,

00:08:54.813 --> 00:08:56.397
no egos,

00:08:56.397 --> 00:08:58.982
and the motivation for moving

00:08:58.982 --> 00:09:00.890
and then exploring the environment

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.789
is in search of food.

00:09:02.789 --> 00:09:06.420
So a chaotic shuffle ensued
as this bunch of strangers

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.328
tied together with yellow ropes
wearing "Being Slime Mold" t-shirts

00:09:10.328 --> 00:09:13.284
wandered through the museum park.

00:09:13.284 --> 00:09:16.610
When they met trees, they had to reshape

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.742
their connections and reform as a mass cell

00:09:19.742 --> 00:09:23.729
through not speaking.

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:27.087
This is a ludicrous experiment in many, many ways.

00:09:27.087 --> 00:09:29.036
This isn't hypothesis-driven.

00:09:29.036 --> 00:09:31.479
We're not trying to prove, demonstrate anything.

00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:33.613
But what it did provide us was a way

00:09:33.613 --> 00:09:35.961
of engaging a broad section of the public

00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:40.392
with ideas of intelligence, agency, autonomy,

00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:42.721
and provide a playful platform

00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:46.453
for discussions about

00:09:46.453 --> 00:09:48.837
the things that ensued.

00:09:48.837 --> 00:09:51.170
One of the most exciting things

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.030
about this experiment

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.217
was the conversation that happened afterwards.

00:09:56.217 --> 00:10:00.040
An entirely spontaneous symposium
happened in the park.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.069
People talked about the human psychology,

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:03.726
of how difficult it was to let go

00:10:03.726 --> 00:10:07.035
of their individual personalities and egos.

00:10:07.035 --> 00:10:10.218
Other people talked about bacterial communication.

00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:12.197
Each person brought in their own

00:10:12.197 --> 00:10:15.054
individual interpretation,

00:10:15.054 --> 00:10:16.959
and our conclusion from this experiment was that

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:20.865
the people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative,

00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:23.661
especially when given beer.

00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:25.627
We didn't just give them oats.

00:10:25.627 --> 00:10:27.189
We gave them beer as well.

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:29.383
But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold,

00:10:29.383 --> 00:10:31.367
and the slime mold, for me,

00:10:31.367 --> 00:10:33.736
is a fascinating subject matter.

00:10:33.736 --> 00:10:35.593
It's biologically fascinating,

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.177
it's computationally interesting,

00:10:37.177 --> 00:10:39.251
but it's also a symbol,

00:10:39.251 --> 00:10:42.909
a way of engaging with ideas of community,

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:46.563
collective behavior, cooperation.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:48.689
A lot of my work draws on the scientific research,

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:51.873
so this pays homage to the maze experiment

00:10:51.873 --> 00:10:53.455
but in a different way.

00:10:53.455 --> 00:10:55.813
And the slime mold is also my working material.

00:10:55.813 --> 00:11:01.030
It's a coproducer of photographs, prints, animations,

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.629
participatory events.

00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:04.977
Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose

00:11:04.977 --> 00:11:06.883
to work with me, exactly,

00:11:06.883 --> 00:11:09.485
it is a collaboration of sorts.

00:11:09.485 --> 00:11:11.577
I can predict certain behaviors

00:11:11.577 --> 00:11:13.633
by understanding how it operates,

00:11:13.633 --> 00:11:15.363
but I can't control it.

00:11:15.363 --> 00:11:16.947
The slime mold has the final say

00:11:16.947 --> 00:11:19.078
in the creative process.

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:22.567
And after all, it has its own internal aesthetics.

00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:24.371
These branching patterns that we see

00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:26.921
we see across all forms, scales of nature,

00:11:26.921 --> 00:11:29.721
from river deltas to lightning strikes,

00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:33.757
from our own blood vessels to neural networks.

00:11:33.757 --> 00:11:36.220
There's clearly significant rules at play

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.485
in this simple yet complex organism,

00:11:38.485 --> 00:11:42.277
and no matter what our disciplinary
perspective or our mode of inquiry,

00:11:42.277 --> 00:11:44.060
there's a great deal that we can learn

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.829
from observing and engaging

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:48.950
with this beautiful, brainless blob.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.165
I give you Physarum polycephalum.

00:11:52.165 --> 00:11:53.918
Thank you.

00:11:53.918 --> 00:11:54.880
(Applause)
