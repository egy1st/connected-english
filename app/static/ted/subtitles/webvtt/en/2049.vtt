00:00:00.736 --> 00:00:03.770
(Music) This is the human test,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.290
a test to see if you are a human.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.489
Please raise your hand if something applies to you.

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:15.330
Are we agreed? Yes?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.486
Then let's begin.

00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:19.395
Have you ever eaten a booger

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:21.937
long past your childhood?

00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:24.583
(Laughter)

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:28.161
It's okay, it's safe here.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:31.510
Have you ever made a small, weird sound

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.150
when you remembered something embarrassing?

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.206
Have you ever purposely lowercased

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.310
the first letter of a text

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.320
in order to come across as sad or disappointed?

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.454
(Laughter)

00:00:47.454 --> 00:00:50.168
Okay.

00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:52.940
Have you ever ended a text with a period

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.650
as a sign of aggression? Okay. Period.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.817
Have you ever laughed or smiled

00:01:01.817 --> 00:01:04.489
when someone said something shitty to you

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.250
and then spent the rest of the day

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.354
wondering why you reacted that way?

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:12.532
Yes.

00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:15.292
Have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:17.180
a thousand times as you walked

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.210
from the check-in to the gate?

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.260
Yes.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.837
Have you ever put on a pair of pants

00:01:24.837 --> 00:01:26.676
and then much later realized that there was

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:29.308
a loose sock smushed up against your thigh?

00:01:29.308 --> 00:01:31.280
(Laughter)

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.812
Good.

00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:36.708
Have you ever tried to guess
someone else's password

00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:40.985
so many times that it locked their account?

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:42.674
Mmm.

00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:45.820
Have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.240
you will be discovered as a fraud?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.314
Yes, it's safe here.

00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:55.910
Have you ever hoped that there was some ability

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.840
you hadn't discovered yet

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.760
that you were just naturally great at?

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.360
Mmm.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.264
Have you ever broken something in real life,

00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:07.976
and then found yourself looking

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:13.050
for an "undo" button in real life?

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.232
Have you ever misplaced your TED badge

00:02:15.232 --> 00:02:16.800
and then immediately started imagining

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.829
what a three-day Vancouver
vacation might look like?

00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:25.402
Have you ever marveled

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:28.537
at how someone you thought was so ordinary

00:02:28.537 --> 00:02:32.946
could suddenly become so beautiful?

00:02:32.946 --> 00:02:35.010
Have you ever stared at your phone

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.460
smiling like an idiot while texting with someone?

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.820
Have you ever subsequently texted that person

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.612
the phrase "I'm staring at the phone

00:02:45.612 --> 00:02:49.158
smiling like an idiot"?

00:02:49.158 --> 00:02:51.228
Have you ever been tempted to,

00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:53.166
and then gave in to the temptation,

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:57.111
of looking through someone else's phone?

00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:59.391
Have you ever had a conversation with yourself

00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:01.375
and then suddenly realized

00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:04.568
you're a real asshole to yourself?

00:03:04.568 --> 00:03:06.975
(Laughter)

00:03:06.975 --> 00:03:09.879
Has your phone ever run out of battery

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.265
in the middle of an argument,

00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:13.863
and it sort of felt like the phone

00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:17.915
was breaking up with both of you?

00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:19.513
Have you ever thought

00:03:19.513 --> 00:03:22.483
that working on an issue between you was futile

00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:25.204
because it should just be easier than this,

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:29.948
or this is supposed to happen just naturally?

00:03:29.948 --> 00:03:33.356
Have you ever realized that very little, in the long run,

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:35.812
just happens naturally?

00:03:35.812 --> 00:03:39.341
Have you ever woken up blissfully

00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:42.148
and suddenly been flooded
by the awful remembrance

00:03:42.148 --> 00:03:45.212
that someone had left you?

00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:47.949
Have you ever lost the ability to imagine a future

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.246
without a person

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:52.500
that no longer was in your life?

00:03:54.418 --> 00:03:56.458
Have you ever looked back on that event

00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:58.366
with the sad smile of autumn

00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:01.766
and the realization that futures will happen

00:04:01.766 --> 00:04:04.901
regardless?

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.966
Congratulations.

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:09.341
You have now completed the test.

00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:12.540
You are all human.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.054
(Applause)
