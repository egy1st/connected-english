00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.536
Here's my thing.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.760
Hold on. There I go. Hey.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.286
I want to start today --
talk about the structure of a polypeptide.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.656
(Laughter)

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.856
I get a lot of people asking me,
in terms of "Lost," you know,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.336
"What the hell's that island?"

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.296
You know, it's usually followed by,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.496
"No, seriously,
what the hell is that island?"

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.776
Why so many mysteries?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.160
What is it about mystery
that I seem to be drawn to?

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.456
And I was thinking about this,
what to talk about at TED.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.656
When I talked to the kind rep from TED,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.376
and I said, "Listen, you know,
what should I talk about?"

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.776
He said, "Don't worry about it.
Just be profound."

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.096
(Laughter)

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.856
And I took enormous comfort in that.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.496
So thank you, if you're here.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.336
I was trying to think,
what do I talk about? Good question.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.616
Why do I do so much
stuff that involves mystery?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.496
And I started trying to figure it out.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.256
And I started thinking
about why do I do any of what I do,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.376
and I started thinking
about my grandfather.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.176
I loved my grandfather.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.296
Harry Kelvin was his name,
my mother's father.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.056
He died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.935
And one of the reasons he was amazing:

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.388
After World War II,
he began an electronics company.

00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:11.976
He started selling surplus parts,
kits, to schools and stuff.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.776
So he had this incredible curiosity.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.696
As a kid, I saw him come over to me

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.136
with radios and telephones
and all sorts of things.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.616
And he'd open them up, he'd unscrew them
and reveal the inner workings --

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.776
which many of us,
I'm sure, take for granted.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.376
But it's an amazing gift to give a kid.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.976
To open up this thing
and show how it works

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.616
and why it works and what it is.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.616
He was the ultimate
deconstructor, in many ways.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.896
And my grandfather was a kind of guy
who would not only take things apart,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.176
but he got me interested
in all sorts of different odd crafts,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.336
like, you know, printing,
like the letter press.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.736
I'm obsessed with printing.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.216
I'm obsessed with silk-screening
and bookbinding and box making.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.496
When I was a kid, I was always,
like, taking apart boxes and stuff.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.256
And last night in the hotel,
I took apart the Kleenex box.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.616
I was just looking at it.
And I'm telling you --

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.056
(Laughter)

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.976
It's a beautiful thing. I swear to God.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.136
I mean, when you look at the box
and you sort of see how it works.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.735
Rives is here, and I met him
years ago at a book fair;

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.976
he does pop-up books.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.056
And I'm obsessed
with engineering of paper.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.936
The scoring of it, the printing of it,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.936
where the thing gets glued,
the registration marks for the ink.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.176
I just love boxes.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.456
My grandfather was the guy

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.256
who kind of got me
into all sorts of these things.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.976
He would also supply me with tools.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.576
He was this amazing encourager --
this patron, sort of, to make stuff.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.136
And he got me a Super 8 camera
when I was 10 years old.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.656
And in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.656
to be a 10-year-old kid
that had access to a camera.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.296
And you know, he was so generous;
I couldn't believe it.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.776
He wasn't doing it
entirely without some manipulation.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.816
I mean, I would call him, and I'd be like,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.376
"Listen, Grandpa,
I really need this camera.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.176
You don't understand.
This is, like, I want to make movies.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.576
I'll get invited to TED one day --"

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.616
(Laughter)

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.856
And, you know, my grandmother
was the greatest.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.616
Because she'd be like, you know --
she'd get on the phone.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.336
She'd be like, "Harry,
it's better than the drugs.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.324
She was fantastic.

00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:11.576
So I found myself getting this stuff,
thanks to her assist,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.856
and suddenly, you know,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.976
I had a synthesizer
when I was 14 years old --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.216
this kind of stuff.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.296
And it let me make things,
which, to me, was sort of the dream.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.856
He sort of humored my obsession
to other things too, like magic.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.616
The thing is, we'd go
to this magic store in New York City

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.016
called Lou Tannen's Magic.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.496
It was this great magic store.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.536
It was a crappy
little building in Midtown,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.216
but you'd be in the elevator,
the elevator would open --

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.296
there'd be this little, small magic store.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.976
You'd be in the magic store.
And it was a magical place.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.496
So I got all these magic tricks.
Here. I'll show you.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.376
This is the kind of thing.
So it would be like, you know.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.216
Which is good, but now I can't move.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.656
Now, I have to do
the rest of the thing like this.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.136
I'm like, "Oh, wow.
Look at my computer over there!"

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.376
(Laughter)

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.776
So one of the things
that I bought at the magic store was this:

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.576
Tannen's Mystery Magic Box.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.376
The premise behind the Mystery
Magic Box was the following:

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.160
15 dollars buys you
50 dollars worth of magic.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.296
Which is a savings.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.176
(Laughter)

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.616
Now, I bought this decades ago
and I'm not kidding.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.256
If you look at this,
you'll see it's never been opened.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.416
But I've had this forever.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.776
Now, I was looking at this,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.216
it was in my office,
as it always is, on the shelf,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.616
and I was thinking,
why have I not opened this?

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.880
And why have I kept it?

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.976
Because I'm not a pack rat.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.216
I don't keep everything,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.416
but for some reason
I haven't opened this box.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.776
And I felt like there was
a key to this, somehow,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.176
in talking about something at TED
that I haven't discussed before,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.416
and bored people elsewhere.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.696
So I thought, maybe
there's something with this.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.616
And there was this giant question mark.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.176
I love the design,
for what it's worth, of this thing.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.456
And I started thinking,
why haven't I opened it?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.376
And I realized that I haven't opened it

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.976
because it represents
something important -- to me.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.400
It represents my grandfather.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.736
Am I allowed to cry at TED?

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.475
Because -- no, I'm not going to cry.

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:59.656
(Laughter)

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.831
But --

00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:04.576
(Laughter)

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.000
The thing is that it represents
infinite possibility.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.896
It represents hope.
It represents potential.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.960
And what I love about this box,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.360
and what I realize I sort of do
in whatever it is that I do,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.456
is I find myself
drawn to infinite possibility,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.696
that sense of potential.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.496
And I realize that mystery
is the catalyst for imagination.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.616
Now, it's not the most
ground-breaking idea,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.216
but when I started to think
that maybe there are times

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.416
when mystery is more important
than knowledge.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.256
I started getting interested in this.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.296
And so I started thinking about "Lost"
and the stuff that we do,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.816
and I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes
are everywhere in what I do!

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.256
In the creation of "Lost,"
Damon Lindelof and I,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.696
who created the show with me,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.856
we were basically tasked
with creating this series

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.576
that we had very little time to do.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.096
We had 11 and a half weeks

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.896
to write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it,
cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.296
So it was not a lot of time.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.096
And that sense of possibility --
what could this thing be?

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.696
There was no time to develop it.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.656
I'm sure you're all familiar with people

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.416
who tell you what you can't do
and what you should change.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.936
There was no time for that,
which is kind of amazing.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.216
And so we did this show,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.016
and for those of you
who haven't seen it, or don't know it,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.376
I can show you one
little clip from the pilot,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.616
just to show you some stuff that we did.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.360
(Engine roaring)

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.600
(Video) Claire: Help!

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.536
Please help me!

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.640
Help me! Please, help me!

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.376
Jack: Get him out of here!
Get him away from the engine!

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.664
Get him out of here!

00:06:40.688 --> 00:06:46.776
(Engine roaring)

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.136
C: Help me, please!
I'm having contractions!

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.896
J: How many months pregnant are you?

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.376
C: I'm only eight months.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.216
J: And how far apart are they coming?

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.280
C: I don't know. I think it just happened.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.720
Man: Hey! Hey! Hey, get away from --

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.736
JJ Abrams: 10 years ago,
if we wanted to do that,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.176
we'd have to kill a stuntman.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.256
(Laughter)

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.216
It would be harder.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.576
Take two would be a bitch.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.856
(Laughter)

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.976
So the amazing thing was,
we were able to do this thing.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.856
And part of that was
the amazing availability of technology,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.296
knowing we could do anything.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.176
I mean, we could never have done that.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.936
We might have been able to write it;

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.416
we wouldn't have been able
to depict it like we did.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.416
So part of the amazing thing for me
is in the creative process,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.576
technology is mind-blowingly
inspiring to me.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.856
I realize that that blank page
is a magic box, you know?

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.096
It needs to be filled
with something fantastic.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.256
I used to have the "Ordinary People"
script that I'd flip through.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.696
The romance was amazing to me;
it would inspire me.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.176
I wanted to try and fill pages

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.976
with the same kind of spirit
and thought and emotion

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.216
that that script did.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.696
So, you know, I love Apple computers.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.936
I'm obsessed.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.656
So the Apple computer --
the PowerBook -- this computer,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.896
it challenges me.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.776
It basically says, what are you
going to write worthy of me?

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.496
I feel this -- I'm compelled.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.816
(Laughter)

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.256
And I often am like,
you know, dude, today I'm out.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.416
I got nothing. You know? So there's that.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.896
In terms of the content of it,

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.096
you look at stories, you think,
what are stories but mystery boxes?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.736
There's a fundamental question --
in TV, the first act is called the teaser.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.096
It's literally the teaser.
It's the big question.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.736
So you're drawn into it.
Then there's another question.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.496
And it goes on. Look at "Star Wars."

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.336
The droids meet the mysterious woman.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.616
Who's that? We don't know. Mystery box!
Then you meet Luke Skywalker.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.976
He gets the droid,
you see the holographic image.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.816
You learn it's a message.
She wants to find Obi Wan Kenobi.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.976
He's her only hope.
But who's Obi Wan Kenobi?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.953
Mystery box! So then he meets Ben Kenobi.

00:08:48.977 --> 00:08:51.696
Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi.
Holy shit! So it keeps us --

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.736
(Laughter)

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.136
Have you guys not seen that?

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.176
(Laughter)

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.416
It's huge! Anyway --

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:02.016
So there's this thing with mystery boxes
that I started feeling compelled.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.616
Then there's the thing of mystery
in terms of imagination --

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.136
the withholding of information.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.176
You know, doing that intentionally
is much more engaging.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.136
Whether it's like the shark in "Jaws" --

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.656
if Spielberg's mechanical shark,
Bruce, had worked,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.856
it would not be remotely as scary;
you would have seen it too much.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.696
In "Alien", they never
really showed the alien: terrifying!

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.856
Even in a movie like
a romantic comedy, "The Graduate,"

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.216
they're having that date,
and they're in the car,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.496
and it's loud, and so they put the top up.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.416
You don't hear anything they're saying!

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.296
You can't hear a word!
But it's the most romantic date ever.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.376
And you love it because you don't hear it.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.976
So to me, there's that.
And then, finally, there's this idea --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.256
stretching the paradigm a little bit --

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.536
but the idea of the mystery box.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.976
Meaning, what you think you're getting,
then what you're really getting.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.096
And it's true in so many
movies and stories.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.576
Look at "E.T.," for example --

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.736
"E.T." is this unbelievable
movie about what?

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.776
It's about an alien
who meets a kid, right?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.736
Well, it's not. "E.T." is about divorce.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.376
"E.T." is about a heartbroken,
divorce-crippled family,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.656
and ultimately,
this kid who can't find his way.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.216
"Die Hard," right? Crazy, great, fun,
action-adventure movie in a building.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.456
It's about a guy
who's on the verge of divorce.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.696
He's showing up to L.A.,
tail between his legs.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.936
There are great scenes --

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.096
maybe not the most amazing
dramatic scenes in the history of time,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.336
but pretty great scenes.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.696
There's a half an hour
of investment in character

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.096
before you get to the stuff
that you're expecting.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.936
When you look at a movie like "Jaws,"

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.216
the scene that you expect --
we have the screen?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.616
These are the kind of scenes

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.096
that you remember and expect from "Jaws."

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.216
And she's being eaten;

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.536
there's a shark.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.776
(Woman screaming)

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.176
The thing about "Jaws" is,
it's really about a guy

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.736
who is sort of dealing with his place
in the world -- with his masculinity,

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.336
with his family, how he's going to,
you know, make it work in this new town.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.256
This is one of my favorite scenes ever,

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.016
and this is a scene
that you wouldn't necessarily think of

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.480
when you think of "Jaws."
But it's an amazing scene.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.840
(Video) Father: C'mere.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.640
Give us a kiss.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.600
Son: Why?

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.880
Father: 'Cause I need it.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.530
JJA: Come on. "Why? 'Cause I need it"?

00:12:00.554 --> 00:12:01.796
Best scene ever, right?

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.836
(Laughter)

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.656
Come on! So you think of "Jaws" --

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.296
so that's the kind of stuff that,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.256
like, you know --
the investment of character,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.056
which is the stuff that really
is inside the box, you know?

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.536
It's why when people do sequels,
or rip off movies, you know, of a genre,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.296
they're ripping off the wrong thing.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.976
You're not supposed
to rip off the shark or the monster.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.856
You know, if you rip something off --
rip off the character.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.416
Rip off the stuff that matters.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.416
I mean, look inside yourself
and figure out what is inside you.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.896
Because ultimately,
the mystery box is all of us.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.778
So there's that. Then the distribution.

00:12:31.802 --> 00:12:34.616
What's a bigger mystery box
than a movie theater? You know?

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.576
You go to the theater,
you're just so excited to see anything.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.096
The moment the lights go down
is often the best part.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.576
And you're full of that amazing --
that feeling of excited anticipation.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.696
And often, the movie's there
and it's going,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.896
and then something happens
and you go, "Oh --", and then, "Mmm ..."

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.296
When it's a great movie,
you're along for the ride

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.463
because you're willing
to give yourself to it.

00:12:54.487 --> 00:12:58.296
So to me, whether it's a TV,
an iPod, computer, cell phone --

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.656
It's funny, I'm an --
as I said, Apple fanatic --

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.416
and one day, about a year or so ago,

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.136
I was signing on online in the morning
to watch Steve Jobs' keynote,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.376
because I always do.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.536
And he came on,
he was presenting the video iPod,

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.336
and what was on
the enormous iPod behind him?

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.656
"Lost"! I had no idea!

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.016
And I realized, holy shit,
it'd come full circle.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.993
The inspiration I get from the technology

00:13:20.017 --> 00:13:22.976
is now using the stuff that I do
to sell technology. It's nuts!

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.216
(Laughter)

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.496
I was going to show you a couple
of other things I'm going to skip.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.696
I'll show you one other thing
that has nothing to do with anything.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.356
This is something online;
six years ago, they did this.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.956
This is an online thing done by guys
who had some visual effects experience.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.156
But the point was,
that they were doing things

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.476
that were using these mystery boxes
that they had -- everyone has now.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.836
What I've realized is what my grandfather
did for me when I was a kid,

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.656
everyone has access to now.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.656
You don't need to have my grandfather,
though you wish you had.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.936
But I have to tell you --

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.456
this is a guy doing stuff
on a Quadra 950 computer --

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.216
the resolution's a little bit low --

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.936
using Infinity software
they stopped making 15 years ago.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.816
He's doing stuff that looks as amazing

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.016
as stuff I've seen
released from Hollywood.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.016
The most incredible
sort of mystery, I think,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.776
is now the question of what comes next.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.816
Because it is now democratized.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.336
So now, the creation of media --
it's everywhere.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.176
The stuff that I was lucky
and begging for to get when I was a kid

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.416
is now ubiquitous.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.256
And so, there's an amazing sense
of opportunity out there.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.376
And when I think of the filmmakers
who exist out there now

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.376
who would have been silenced, you know --

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.816
who have been silenced in the past --

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.176
it's a very exciting thing.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.336
I used to say in classes
and lectures and stuff,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.096
to someone who wants to write,
"Go! Write! Do your thing."

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.896
It's free, you don't need permission.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.176
But now I can say, "Go make your movie!"
There's nothing stopping you

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.456
from going out there
and getting the technology.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.896
You can lease, rent,
buy stuff off the shelf

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.696
that is either as good, or just as good,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.256
as the stuff that's being used
by the, you know, "legit people."

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.416
No community is best served
when only the elite have control.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.616
And I feel like
this is an amazing opportunity

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.096
to see what else is out there.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.336
When I did "Mission: Impossible III,"
we had amazing visual effects.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.256
ILM did the effects; it was incredible.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.016
And sort of my dream to be involved.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.376
And there are a couple
of sequences in the movie,

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.440
like these couple of moments
I'll show you.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.720
There's that.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.814
(Video) Luther: Ethan, move!

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.600
(Explosion)

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.376
Obviously, I have an obsession
with big crazy explosions.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.976
So my favorite visual effect in the movie
is the one I'm about to show you.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.216
It's a scene in which
Tom's character wakes up.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.496
He's drowsy. He's crazy.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.176
And the guy wakes up,
and he shoves this gun in his nose

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.336
and shoots this little capsule
into his brain

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.040
that he's going to use later
to kill him, as bad guys do.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.760
(Video) Brownway: Good morning.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.936
JJA: OK, now.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.176
When we shot that scene,

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.256
the actor who had the gun,
an English actor, Eddie Marsan --

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.496
sweetheart, great guy --

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.096
he kept taking the gun
and putting it into Tom's nose,

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.616
and it was hurting Tom's nose.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.816
And I learned this
very early on in my career:

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.096
Don't hurt Tom's nose.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.016
(Laughter)

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.136
There are three things
you don't want to do.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.976
Number two is: Don't hurt Tom's nose.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.696
So Eddie has this gun --
and he's this sweet English guy.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.856
He's like, "Sorry,
I don't want to hurt you."

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.896
I'm like, "We have to
make this look good."

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.159
And I realized that we had to do something
because it wasn't working.

00:16:38.183 --> 00:16:40.416
And I thought back
to what I would have done

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.856
using the Super 8 camera
that my grandfather got me

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.096
sitting in that room,

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.856
and I realized that hand
didn't have to be Eddie Marsan's.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.096
It could be Tom's.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.456
And Tom would know
just how hard to push the gun.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.696
He wouldn't hurt himself.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.376
So we took his hand and we painted it
to look a little bit more like Eddie's.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.256
We put it in Eddie's sleeve,

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.776
and so the hand that you see --

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.976
that's not Eddie's hand, that's Tom's.
So Tom is playing two roles.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.416
(Laughter)

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.256
And he didn't ask for any more money.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.839
So here, here. Watch it again.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.335
There he is. He's waking up.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.480
He's drowsy, been through a lot.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.976
(Video) Brownway: Good morning.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.136
JJA: Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.376
Anyway.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.616
So ...

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.016
(Applause)

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.256
Thanks.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.335
(Applause)

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:32.976
So you don't need the greatest technology
to do things that can work in movies.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.336
And the mystery box,
in honor of my grandfather, stays closed.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.576
Thank you.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.200
(Applause)
