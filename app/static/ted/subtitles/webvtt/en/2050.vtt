00:00:01.071 --> 00:00:05.478
I would like to share with you
a new model of higher education,

00:00:05.502 --> 00:00:08.284
a model that, once expanded,

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.626
can enhance the collective intelligence

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.119
of millions of creative
and motivated individuals

00:00:15.143 --> 00:00:17.575
that otherwise would be left behind.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.469
Look at the world.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.281
Pick a place and focus on it.

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:26.354
You will find humans
chasing higher education.

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:28.636
Let's meet some of them.

00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:30.797
Patrick.

00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:35.615
Patrick was born in Liberia
to a family of 20 children.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.980
During the civil war,

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.923
he and his family were forced
to flee to Nigeria.

00:00:42.468 --> 00:00:45.206
There, in spite of his situation,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.738
he graduated high school
with nearly perfect grades.

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:52.453
He wanted to continue to higher education,

00:00:52.477 --> 00:00:55.737
but due to his family
living on the poverty line,

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.268
he was soon sent to South Africa

00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:02.005
to work and send back money
to feed his family.

00:01:03.036 --> 00:01:06.868
Patrick never gave up his dream
of higher education.

00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:09.291
Late at night, after work,

00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:13.027
he surfed the net,
looking for ways to study.

00:01:13.827 --> 00:01:15.093
Meet Debbie.

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:16.983
Debbie is from Florida.

00:01:17.897 --> 00:01:22.046
Her parents didn't go to college,
and neither did any of her siblings.

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:24.687
Debbie has worked all her life,

00:01:26.013 --> 00:01:29.823
pays taxes, supports herself
month to month,

00:01:29.847 --> 00:01:32.175
proud of the American dream,

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:36.180
a dream that just won't be complete
without higher education.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.589
But Debbie doesn't have the savings
for higher education.

00:01:40.613 --> 00:01:42.523
She can't pay the tuition.

00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:44.829
Neither could she leave work.

00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:47.277
Meet Wael.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.145
Wael is from Syria.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.187
He's experiencing firsthand

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:57.554
the misery, fear and failure
imposed on his country.

00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:01.306
He's a big believer in education.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.363
He knew that if he could find
an opportunity for higher education,

00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:08.182
an opportunity to get ahead of the rest,

00:02:08.206 --> 00:02:12.667
he has a better chance to survive
in a world turned upside down.

00:02:14.057 --> 00:02:16.059
The higher education system

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:20.217
failed Patrick, Debbie and Wael,

00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:25.186
exactly as it is failing
millions of potential students --

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.163
millions that graduate high school,

00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:31.575
millions that are qualified
for higher education,

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.103
millions that want to study
yet cannot access it for various reasons.

00:02:37.618 --> 00:02:39.523
First: financial.

00:02:40.412 --> 00:02:43.307
Universities are expensive;
we all know it.

00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:45.435
In large parts of the world,

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.346
higher education is unattainable
for an average citizen.

00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:54.102
This is probably the biggest problem
facing our society.

00:02:54.672 --> 00:02:58.258
Higher education stopped
being a right for all

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:00.952
and became a privilege for the few.

00:03:01.971 --> 00:03:04.053
Second: cultural.

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:08.890
Students who are qualified
for higher education

00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:12.153
can afford -- want to study -- cannot,

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.428
because it is not decent,
it is not a place for a woman.

00:03:19.047 --> 00:03:22.986
This is the story of countless women
in Africa, for example,

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.940
prevented from higher education
because of cultural barriers.

00:03:27.686 --> 00:03:30.086
And here comes the third reason:

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.922
UNESCO stated that in 2025,

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:39.590
100 million students will be deprived
of higher education,

00:03:39.614 --> 00:03:44.584
simply because there will not be enough
seats to accommodate them,

00:03:44.608 --> 00:03:46.339
to meet the demand.

00:03:46.363 --> 00:03:49.532
They will take a placement test,
they will pass it,

00:03:49.556 --> 00:03:53.863
but they still won't have access,
because there are no places available.

00:03:55.416 --> 00:04:00.116
These are the reasons
I founded University of the People,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.023
a nonprofit, tuition-free,
degree-granting university

00:04:05.047 --> 00:04:06.834
to give an alternative,

00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:10.352
to create an alternative,
to those who have no other;

00:04:10.376 --> 00:04:15.817
an alternative that will be
affordable and scalable,

00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:21.701
an alternative that will disrupt
the current education system,

00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:25.893
and open the gates to higher education
for every qualified student

00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:30.529
regardless of what they earn,
where they live,

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:32.846
or what society says about them.

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.421
Patrick, Debbie and Wael

00:04:35.445 --> 00:04:39.071
are only three examples
out of the 1,700 accepted students

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:41.446
from 143 countries.

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:44.872
(Applause)

00:04:44.896 --> 00:04:46.172
Thank you.

00:04:46.196 --> 00:04:48.004
(Applause)

00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:50.249
We didn't need to reinvent the wheel.

00:04:50.273 --> 00:04:52.785
We just looked at what wasn't working

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.548
and used the amazing power of the Internet

00:04:55.572 --> 00:04:56.868
to get around it.

00:04:57.386 --> 00:04:59.923
We set out to build a model

00:05:00.928 --> 00:05:04.924
that will cut down almost entirely
the cost of higher education.

00:05:05.927 --> 00:05:07.412
And that's how we did it.

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:10.405
First, bricks and mortar cost money.

00:05:11.324 --> 00:05:16.446
Universities have expenses
that virtual universities don't.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.616
We don't need to pass these expenses
on to our students.

00:05:20.124 --> 00:05:21.504
They don't exist.

00:05:21.528 --> 00:05:24.647
We also don't need
to worry about capacity.

00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:28.295
There are no limits of seats
in virtual university.

00:05:28.867 --> 00:05:32.657
Actually, nobody needs to stand
at the back of the lecture hall.

00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:37.119
Textbooks are also something
our students don't need to buy.

00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:40.707
By using open educational resources

00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:43.187
and the generosity of professors

00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:47.723
who are putting their material up
free and accessible,

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:50.499
we don't need to send
our students to buy textbooks.

00:05:50.523 --> 00:05:52.819
All of our materials come free.

00:05:53.635 --> 00:05:55.241
Even professors,

00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:59.136
the most expensive line
in any university balance sheet,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.816
come free to our students.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.587
Over 3,000 of them,

00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:09.624
including presidents, vice chancellors,
professors and academic advisers

00:06:09.648 --> 00:06:15.200
from top universities such as NYU,
Yale, Berkeley and Oxford,

00:06:15.224 --> 00:06:17.502
came on board to help our students.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.984
Finally, is our belief
in peer-to-peer learning.

00:06:22.394 --> 00:06:25.600
We use this sound pedagogical model

00:06:25.624 --> 00:06:28.337
to encourage our students
from all over the world

00:06:28.361 --> 00:06:30.691
to interact and study together,

00:06:30.715 --> 00:06:35.754
and also to reduce the time
our professors need

00:06:35.778 --> 00:06:38.030
to labor over class assignments.

00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:46.208
If the Internet has made us
a global village,

00:06:46.232 --> 00:06:49.997
this model can develop
its future leadership.

00:06:50.378 --> 00:06:51.645
Look how we do it.

00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:55.055
We only offer two programs:

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:57.752
business administration
and computer science,

00:06:57.776 --> 00:07:01.934
the two programs most in demand worldwide,

00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:06.175
the two programs that are likeliest
to help our students find a job.

00:07:07.512 --> 00:07:10.250
When our students are accepted,

00:07:10.274 --> 00:07:16.137
they are placed in a small classroom
of 20 to 30 students,

00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:20.313
to ensure that those who need
personalized attention get it.

00:07:20.827 --> 00:07:26.590
Moreover, for every nine-week course,
they meet a new peer,

00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:30.105
a whole new set of students
from all over the world.

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:33.385
Every week, when they go
into the classroom,

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:36.142
they find the lecture notes of the week,

00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:38.430
the reading assignment,
the homework assignment,

00:07:38.454 --> 00:07:42.381
and the discussion question,
which is the core of our studies.

00:07:42.405 --> 00:07:46.863
Every week, every student must contribute
to the class discussion,

00:07:46.887 --> 00:07:51.085
and also must comment
on the contribution of others.

00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:54.607
This way, we open our students' minds,

00:07:54.631 --> 00:07:59.256
we develop a positive shift in attitude
toward different cultures.

00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:03.830
By the end of each week,
the students take a quiz,

00:08:03.854 --> 00:08:05.177
hand in their homework,

00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:09.403
which are assessed by their peers
under the supervision of the instructors,

00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:12.542
get a grade, move to the next week.

00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:15.212
By the end of the course,
they take the final exam,

00:08:15.236 --> 00:08:19.404
get a grade, and follow
to the next course.

00:08:20.703 --> 00:08:25.875
We open the gates for higher education
for every qualified student.

00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:29.769
Every student with a high school diploma,

00:08:29.793 --> 00:08:32.933
sufficient English and Internet connection

00:08:32.957 --> 00:08:34.549
can study with us.

00:08:34.573 --> 00:08:37.481
We don't use audio, we don't use video.

00:08:37.505 --> 00:08:39.865
Broadband is not necessary.

00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:44.468
Any student from any part of the world
with any Internet connection

00:08:44.492 --> 00:08:45.891
can study with us.

00:08:46.798 --> 00:08:48.170
We are tuition free.

00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:52.819
All we ask our students to cover
is the cost of their exams,

00:08:52.843 --> 00:08:54.922
100 dollars per exam.

00:08:55.396 --> 00:08:59.996
A full-time bachelor's degree
student taking 40 courses

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.017
will pay 1,000 dollars a year,

00:09:02.867 --> 00:09:05.497
4,000 dollars for the entire degree.

00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:09.097
And for those who cannot afford even this,

00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:11.871
we offer them a variety of scholarships.

00:09:11.895 --> 00:09:14.949
It is our mission that nobody
will be left behind

00:09:14.973 --> 00:09:16.423
for financial reasons.

00:09:17.058 --> 00:09:23.114
With 5,000 students in 2016,
this model is financially sustainable.

00:09:25.352 --> 00:09:28.958
Five years ago, it was a vision.

00:09:29.813 --> 00:09:32.139
Today, it is a reality.

00:09:32.862 --> 00:09:37.645
Last month, we got the ultimate
academic endorsement to our model.

00:09:38.325 --> 00:09:41.898
University of the People
is now fully accredited.

00:09:42.743 --> 00:09:44.005
(Applause)

00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:45.253
Thank you.

00:09:45.277 --> 00:09:49.225
(Applause)

00:09:49.386 --> 00:09:53.536
With this accreditation,
it's our time now to scale up.

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:57.324
We have demonstrated that our model works.

00:09:58.404 --> 00:10:01.392
I invite universities
and, even more important,

00:10:01.416 --> 00:10:03.085
developing countries' governments,

00:10:03.109 --> 00:10:05.015
to replicate this model

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:09.570
to ensure that the gates of higher
education will open widely.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.815
A new era is coming --

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.743
an era that will witness the disruption
of the higher education model

00:10:17.767 --> 00:10:19.211
as we know it today,

00:10:19.931 --> 00:10:22.727
from being a privilege for the few

00:10:23.658 --> 00:10:29.051
to becoming a basic right,
affordable and accessible for all.

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:31.098
Thank you.

00:10:31.122 --> 00:10:35.344
(Applause)
