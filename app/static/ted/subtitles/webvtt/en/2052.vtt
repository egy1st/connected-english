00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.579
Take a look at this drawing.

00:00:02.579 --> 00:00:04.183
Can you tell what it is?

00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:06.930
I'm a molecular biologist by training,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.533
and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.625
They're usually referred to as a model figure,

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:14.359
a drawing that shows how we think

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.023
a cellular or molecular process occurs.

00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:19.522
This particular drawing is of a process

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:23.845
called clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:26.455
It's a process by which a molecule can get

00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:28.693
from the outside of the cell to the inside

00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:31.230
by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.050
that then gets internalized by the cell.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.885
There's a problem with this drawing, though,

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:38.517
and it's mainly in what it doesn't show.

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:39.982
From lots of experiments,

00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:41.817
from lots of different scientists,

00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:44.813
we know a lot about what these molecules look like,

00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:46.495
how they move around in the cell,

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:48.320
and that this is all taking place

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.310
in an incredibly dynamic environment.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.783
So in collaboration with a clathrin
expert Tomas Kirchhausen,

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.102
we decided to create a new kind of model figure

00:00:57.102 --> 00:00:59.126
that showed all of that.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:00.862
So we start outside of the cell.

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:02.510
Now we're looking inside.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.590
Clathrin are these three-legged molecules

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.878
that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.

00:01:07.878 --> 00:01:09.575
Through connections with a membrane,

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:11.742
clathrin is able to deform the membrane

00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:13.155
and form this sort of a cup

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:15.462
that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle,

00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:17.246
that's now capturing some of the proteins

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:18.900
that were outside of the cell.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.398
Proteins are coming in now that
basically pinch off this vesicle,

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:24.982
making it separate from the rest of the membrane,

00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:27.374
and now clathrin is basically done with its job,

00:01:27.374 --> 00:01:28.612
and so proteins are coming in now —

00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:30.558
we've covered them yellow and orange —

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:33.100
that are responsible for taking
apart this clathrin cage.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.382
And so all of these proteins
can get basically recycled

00:01:36.382 --> 00:01:37.918
and used all over again.

00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:41.327
These processes are too small to be seen directly,

00:01:41.327 --> 00:01:43.159
even with the best microscopes,

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.790
so animations like this provide a really powerful way

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.808
of visualizing a hypothesis.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.654
Here's another illustration,

00:01:50.654 --> 00:01:53.390
and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.895
that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells.

00:01:56.895 --> 00:01:59.414
And again, this is a vast oversimplification

00:01:59.414 --> 00:02:01.158
and doesn't begin to show

00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:03.640
what we actually know about these processes.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.855
You might be surprised to know

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:08.622
that these simple drawings are the only way

00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:12.454
that most biologists visualize
their molecular hypotheses.

00:02:12.454 --> 00:02:13.482
Why?

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:15.472
Because creating movies of processes

00:02:15.472 --> 00:02:18.486
as we think they actually occur is really hard.

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:22.119
I spent months in Hollywood
learning 3D animation software,

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:24.400
and I spend months on each animation,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.750
and that's just time that most
researchers can't afford.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.950
The payoffs can be huge, though.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.334
Molecular animations are unparalleled

00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:35.775
in their ability to convey a great deal of information

00:02:35.775 --> 00:02:39.367
to broad audiences with extreme accuracy.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:40.870
And I'm working on a new project now

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.308
called "The Science of HIV"

00:02:42.308 --> 00:02:44.670
where I'll be animating the entire life cycle

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.774
of the HIV virus as accurately as possible

00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:49.735
and all in molecular detail.

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.886
The animation will feature data

00:02:51.886 --> 00:02:54.862
from thousands of researchers
collected over decades,

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:57.942
data on what this virus looks like,

00:02:57.942 --> 00:03:01.030
how it's able to infect cells in our body,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.002
and how therapeutics are
helping to combat infection.

00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:07.331
Over the years, I found that animations

00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.150
aren't just useful for communicating an idea,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.646
but they're also really useful

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:13.958
for exploring a hypothesis.

00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.152
Biologists for the most part are
still using a paper and pencil

00:03:17.152 --> 00:03:19.374
to visualize the processes they study,

00:03:19.374 --> 00:03:22.854
and with the data we have now,
that's just not good enough anymore.

00:03:22.854 --> 00:03:25.270
The process of creating an animation

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.927
can act as a catalyst that allows researchers

00:03:27.927 --> 00:03:30.878
to crystalize and refine their own ideas.

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.662
One researcher I worked with

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:34.438
who works on the molecular mechanisms

00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:36.222
of neurodegenerative diseases

00:03:36.222 --> 00:03:38.200
came up with experiments that were related

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.183
directly to the animation that
she and I worked on together,

00:03:41.183 --> 00:03:45.304
and in this way, animation can
feed back into the research process.

00:03:45.304 --> 00:03:48.157
I believe that animation can change biology.

00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:50.725
It can change the way that we
communicate with one another,

00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:52.348
how we explore our data

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:53.675
and how we teach our students.

00:03:53.675 --> 00:03:55.129
But for that change to happen,

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.286
we need more researchers creating animations,

00:03:58.286 --> 00:04:00.541
and toward that end, I brought together a team

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:03.678
of biologists, animators and programmers

00:04:03.678 --> 00:04:06.725
to create a new, free, open-source software —

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:08.629
we call it Molecular Flipbook —

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.525
that's created just for biologists

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:14.070
just to create molecular animations.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.782
From our testing, we've found
that it only takes 15 minutes

00:04:17.782 --> 00:04:21.050
for a biologist who has never
touched animation software before

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.786
to create her first molecular animation

00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:25.308
of her own hypothesis.

00:04:25.308 --> 00:04:27.458
We're also building an online database

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:30.233
where anyone can view, download and contribute

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:31.849
their own animations.

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.820
We're really excited to announce

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.282
that the beta version of the molecular animation

00:04:36.282 --> 00:04:40.490
software toolkit will be available for download today.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.233
We are really excited to see
what biologists will create with it

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:45.289
and what new insights they're able to gain

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:46.770
from finally being able to animate

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.473
their own model figures.

00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:50.713
Thank you.

00:04:50.713 --> 00:04:53.871
(Applause)
