00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:02.470
This year, Germany is celebrating

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.556
the 25th anniversary of the peaceful revolution

00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:07.092
in East Germany.

00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:11.858
In 1989, the Communist regime was moved away,

00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:15.320
the Berlin Wall came down, and one year later,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.485
the German Democratic Republic, the GDR,

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.154
in the East was unified

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.844
with the Federal Republic of Germany in the West

00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:27.117
to found today's Germany.

00:00:27.117 --> 00:00:30.511
Among many other things, Germany inherited

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:35.104
the archives of the East German secret police,

00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:38.420
known as the Stasi.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.960
Only two years after its dissolution,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.602
its documents were opened to the public,

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:47.677
and historians such as me started

00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:49.105
to study these documents

00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:53.797
to learn more about how the GDR surveillance state

00:00:53.797 --> 00:00:55.507
functioned.

00:00:55.507 --> 00:00:58.303
Perhaps you have watched the movie

00:00:58.303 --> 00:01:00.341
"The Lives of Others."

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:05.082
This movie made the Stasi known worldwide,

00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:07.942
and as we live in an age where words

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:11.229
such as "surveillance" or "wiretapping"

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.979
are on the front pages of newspapers,

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.802
I would like to speak about how the Stasi

00:01:16.802 --> 00:01:19.201
really worked.

00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:21.970
At the beginning, let's have a short look

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.928
at the history of the Stasi,

00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:26.219
because it's really important for understanding

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.706
its self-conception.

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:32.418
Its origins are located in Russia.

00:01:32.418 --> 00:01:34.736
In 1917, the Russian Communists founded

00:01:34.736 --> 00:01:36.930
the Emergency Commission for Combating

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.731
Counter-Revolution and Sabotage,

00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:41.950
shortly Cheka.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.960
It was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.203
The Cheka was an instrument of the Communists

00:01:48.203 --> 00:01:51.960
to establish their regime by terrorizing the population

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.435
and executing their enemies.

00:01:54.435 --> 00:02:00.244
It evolved later into the well-known KGB.

00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:03.750
The Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.822
They called themselves Chekists,

00:02:06.822 --> 00:02:09.680
and even the emblem was very similar,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.661
as you can see here.

00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:16.227
In fact, the secret police of Russia

00:02:16.227 --> 00:02:19.518
was the creator and instructor of the Stasi.

00:02:19.518 --> 00:02:23.109
When the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945,

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.497
it immediately expanded there,

00:02:25.497 --> 00:02:29.118
and soon it started to train the German Communists

00:02:29.118 --> 00:02:32.366
to build up their own secret police.

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:35.886
By the way, in this hall where we are now,

00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:41.566
the ruling party of the GDR was founded in 1946.

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:44.950
Five years later, the Stasi was established,

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.569
and step by step, the dirty job of oppression

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.111
was handed over to it.

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:52.542
For instance, the central jail

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:53.856
for political prisoners,

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:56.604
which was established by the Russians,

00:02:56.604 --> 00:02:58.864
was taken over by the Stasi

00:02:58.864 --> 00:03:02.048
and used until the end of Communism.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.850
You see it here.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.485
At the beginning, every important step

00:03:07.485 --> 00:03:11.040
took place under the attendance of the Russians.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.141
But the Germans are known to be very effective,

00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:17.519
so the Stasi grew very quickly,

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.207
and already in 1953, it had more employees

00:03:21.207 --> 00:03:22.905
than the Gestapo had,

00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:25.695
the secret police of Nazi Germany.

00:03:25.695 --> 00:03:28.133
The number doubled in each decade.

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:31.558
In 1989, more than 90,000 employees

00:03:31.558 --> 00:03:33.223
worked for the Stasi.

00:03:33.223 --> 00:03:35.597
This meant that one employee

00:03:35.597 --> 00:03:38.810
was responsible for 180 inhabitants,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.809
which was really unique in the world.

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:45.405
At the top of this tremendous apparatus,

00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:49.189
there was one man, Erich Mielke.

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.450
He ruled the Ministry of State Security

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.769
for more than 30 years.

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.400
He was a scrupulous functionary —

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.122
in his past, he killed two policemen

00:03:59.122 --> 00:04:01.130
not far away from here —

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.197
who in fact personalized the Stasi.

00:04:05.197 --> 00:04:09.690
But what was so exceptional about the Stasi?

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.600
Foremost, it was its enormous power,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.090
because it united different functions

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.365
in one organization.

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:20.476
First of all, the Stasi

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:23.571
was an intelligence service.

00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:26.050
It used all the imaginable instruments

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.333
for getting information secretly,

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:31.934
such as informers, or tapping phones,

00:04:31.934 --> 00:04:34.802
as you can see it on the picture here.

00:04:34.802 --> 00:04:37.806
And it was not only active in East Germany,

00:04:37.806 --> 00:04:40.543
but all over the world.

00:04:40.543 --> 00:04:44.506
Secondly, the Stasi was a secret police.

00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:46.650
It could stop people on the street

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.078
and arrest them in its own prisons.

00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:52.580
Thirdly, the Stasi worked

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.435
as a kind of public prosecutor.

00:04:55.435 --> 00:04:58.565
It had the right to open preliminary investigations

00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:02.262
and to interrogate people officially.

00:05:02.262 --> 00:05:04.353
Last but not least,

00:05:04.353 --> 00:05:08.218
the Stasi had its own armed forces.

00:05:08.218 --> 00:05:10.222
More than 11,000 soldiers were serving

00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:13.732
in its so-called Guards Regiment.

00:05:13.732 --> 00:05:18.148
It was founded to crash down protests and uprisings.

00:05:18.148 --> 00:05:20.875
Due to this concentration of power,

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:25.940
the Stasi was called a state in the state.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.199
But let's look in more and more detail

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.816
at the tools of the Stasi.

00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:32.459
Please keep in mind that at that time

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:36.284
the web and smartphones were not yet invented.

00:05:36.284 --> 00:05:39.525
Of course, the Stasi used all kinds

00:05:39.525 --> 00:05:42.598
of technical instruments to survey people.

00:05:42.598 --> 00:05:44.711
Telephones were wiretapped,

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:48.850
including the phone of the
German chancellor in the West,

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.802
and often also the apartments.

00:05:51.802 --> 00:05:55.195
Every day, 90,000 letters were being opened

00:05:55.195 --> 00:05:58.541
by these machines.

00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:02.239
The Stasi also shadowed
tens of thousands of people

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:05.471
using specially trained agents and secret cameras

00:06:05.471 --> 00:06:09.006
to document every step one took.

00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:11.674
In this picture, you can see me

00:06:11.674 --> 00:06:15.154
as a young man just in front of this building

00:06:15.154 --> 00:06:18.908
where we are now, photographed by a Stasi agent.

00:06:18.908 --> 00:06:23.304
The Stasi even collected the smell of people.

00:06:23.304 --> 00:06:26.563
It stored samples of it in closed jars

00:06:26.563 --> 00:06:31.022
which were found after the peaceful revolution.

00:06:31.022 --> 00:06:35.258
For all these tasks, highly specialized departments

00:06:35.258 --> 00:06:37.626
were responsible.

00:06:37.626 --> 00:06:39.806
The one which was tapping phone calls

00:06:39.806 --> 00:06:41.696
was completely separated

00:06:41.696 --> 00:06:44.242
from the one which controlled the letters,

00:06:44.242 --> 00:06:45.540
for good reasons,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.217
because if one agent quit the Stasi,

00:06:50.217 --> 00:06:52.131
his knowledge was very small.

00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:56.119
Contrast that with Snowden, for example.

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:59.196
But the vertical specialization was also important

00:06:59.196 --> 00:07:01.501
to prevent all kinds of empathy

00:07:01.501 --> 00:07:04.496
with the object of observation.

00:07:04.496 --> 00:07:06.800
The agent who shadowed me

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.657
didn't know who I was

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.522
or why I was surveyed.

00:07:10.522 --> 00:07:12.136
In fact, I smuggled forbidden books

00:07:12.136 --> 00:07:15.028
from West to East Germany.

00:07:15.028 --> 00:07:18.220
But what was even more typical for the Stasi

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.384
was the use of human intelligence,

00:07:21.384 --> 00:07:25.577
people who reported secretly to the Stasi.

00:07:25.577 --> 00:07:27.379
For the Minister of State Security,

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.291
these so-called unofficial employees

00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:33.186
were the most important tools.

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:38.509
From 1975 on, nearly 200,000 people

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:41.346
collaborated constantly with the Stasi,

00:07:41.346 --> 00:07:46.222
more than one percent of the population.

00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:48.950
And in a way, the minister was right,

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.891
because technical instruments

00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:54.463
can only register what people are doing,

00:07:54.463 --> 00:07:57.771
but agents and spies can also report

00:07:57.771 --> 00:07:59.474
what people are planning to do

00:07:59.474 --> 00:08:01.834
and what they are thinking.

00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:06.615
Therefore, the Stasi recruited so many informants.

00:08:06.615 --> 00:08:09.459
The system of how to get them

00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:12.491
and how to educate them, as it was called,

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:15.181
was very sophisticated.

00:08:15.181 --> 00:08:18.088
The Stasi had its own university,

00:08:18.088 --> 00:08:19.608
not far away from here,

00:08:19.608 --> 00:08:21.535
where the methods were explored

00:08:21.535 --> 00:08:24.204
and taught to the officers.

00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:27.955
This guideline gave a detailed description

00:08:27.955 --> 00:08:30.578
of every step you have to take

00:08:30.578 --> 00:08:32.940
if you want to convince human beings

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.920
to betray their fellow citizens.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.264
Sometimes it's said that informants were pressured

00:08:40.264 --> 00:08:41.720
to becoming one,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.314
but that's mostly not true,

00:08:44.314 --> 00:08:48.225
because a forced informant is a bad informant.

00:08:48.225 --> 00:08:51.312
Only someone who wants to give
you the information you need

00:08:51.312 --> 00:08:53.973
is an effective whistleblower.

00:08:53.973 --> 00:08:58.830
The main reasons why people
cooperated with the Stasi

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:04.330
were political conviction and material benefits.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.440
The officers also tried to create a personal bond

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.848
between themselves and the informant,

00:09:10.848 --> 00:09:16.000
and to be honest, the example of the Stasi shows

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.392
that it's not so difficult to win someone

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:22.835
in order to betray others.

00:09:22.835 --> 00:09:26.586
Even some of the top dissidents in East Germany

00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:28.421
collaborated with the Stasi,

00:09:28.421 --> 00:09:32.166
as for instance Ibrahim Böhme.

00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:34.956
In 1989, he was the leader of the peaceful revolution

00:09:34.956 --> 00:09:39.330
and he nearly became the first freely
elected Prime Minister of the GDR

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:44.475
until it came out that he was an informant.

00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:48.404
The net of spies was really broad.

00:09:48.404 --> 00:09:50.110
In nearly every institution,

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.355
even in the churches or in West Germany,

00:09:53.355 --> 00:09:55.543
there were many of them.

00:09:55.543 --> 00:09:59.032
I remember telling a leading Stasi officer,

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:02.461
"If you had sent an informant to me,

00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:05.091
I would surely have recognized him."

00:10:05.091 --> 00:10:06.950
His answer was,

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.393
"We didn't send anyone.

00:10:08.393 --> 00:10:11.415
We took those who were around you."

00:10:11.415 --> 00:10:14.070
And in fact, two of my best friends

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.401
reported about me to the Stasi.

00:10:18.401 --> 00:10:20.990
Not only in my case, informers were very close.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.693
For example, Vera Lengsfeld,
another leading dissident,

00:10:24.693 --> 00:10:28.906
in her case it was her husband who spied on her.

00:10:28.906 --> 00:10:32.259
A famous writer was betrayed by his brother.

00:10:32.259 --> 00:10:36.151
This reminds me of the novel "1984" by George Orwell,

00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:39.230
where the only apparently trustable person

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.043
was an informer.

00:10:42.043 --> 00:10:45.740
But why did the Stasi collect all this information

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.661
in its archives?

00:10:47.661 --> 00:10:51.720
The main purpose was to control the society.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.303
In nearly every speech, the Stasi minister

00:10:54.303 --> 00:10:57.025
gave the order to find out who is who,

00:10:57.025 --> 00:11:00.119
which meant who thinks what.

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:01.870
He didn't want to wait until somebody

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.390
tried to act against the regime.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.280
He wanted to know in advance

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.175
what people were thinking and planning.

00:11:09.175 --> 00:11:11.997
The East Germans knew, of course,

00:11:11.997 --> 00:11:15.167
that they were surrounded by informers,

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:19.140
in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.234
and a state of widespread fear,

00:11:22.234 --> 00:11:25.750
the most important tools to oppress people

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.909
in any dictatorship.

00:11:27.909 --> 00:11:30.512
That's why not many East Germans tried

00:11:30.512 --> 00:11:34.796
to fight against the Communist regime.

00:11:34.796 --> 00:11:39.378
If yes, the Stasi often used a method

00:11:39.378 --> 00:11:42.050
which was really diabolic.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.236
It was called Zersetzung,

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:47.907
and it's described in another guideline.

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:50.707
The word is difficult to translate because it means

00:11:50.707 --> 00:11:54.605
originally "biodegradation."

00:11:54.605 --> 00:11:57.959
But actually, it's a quite accurate description.

00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:01.518
The goal was to destroy secretly

00:12:01.518 --> 00:12:04.408
the self-confidence of people,

00:12:04.408 --> 00:12:07.521
for example by damaging their reputation,

00:12:07.521 --> 00:12:10.990
by organizing failures in their work,

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.620
and by destroying their personal relationships.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.995
Considering this, East Germany
was a very modern dictatorship.

00:12:20.995 --> 00:12:25.366
The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident.

00:12:25.366 --> 00:12:28.457
It preferred to paralyze them,

00:12:28.457 --> 00:12:30.960
and it could do so because

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.310
it had access to so much personal information

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:38.240
and to so many institutions.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.512
Detaining someone was used only

00:12:40.512 --> 00:12:43.042
as a last resort.

00:12:43.042 --> 00:12:46.347
For this, the Stasi owned 17 remand prisons,

00:12:46.347 --> 00:12:48.864
one in every district.

00:12:48.864 --> 00:12:51.538
Here, the Stasi also developed

00:12:51.538 --> 00:12:55.980
quite modern methods of detention.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.763
Normally, the interrogation officer

00:12:57.763 --> 00:13:01.226
didn't torture the prisoner.

00:13:01.226 --> 00:13:03.802
Instead, he used a sophisticated system

00:13:03.802 --> 00:13:05.940
of psychological pressure

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.034
in which strict isolation was central.

00:13:10.034 --> 00:13:12.318
Nearly no prisoner resisted

00:13:12.318 --> 00:13:15.547
without giving a testimony.

00:13:15.547 --> 00:13:17.609
If you have the occasion,

00:13:17.609 --> 00:13:21.060
do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.649
and attend a guided tour
with a former political prisoner

00:13:24.649 --> 00:13:27.505
who will explain to you how this worked.

00:13:27.505 --> 00:13:30.664
One more question needs to be answered:

00:13:30.664 --> 00:13:33.106
If the Stasi were so well organized,

00:13:33.106 --> 00:13:37.439
why did the Communist regime collapse?

00:13:37.439 --> 00:13:41.570
First, in 1989, the leadership in East Germany

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.831
was uncertain what to do against

00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:46.768
the growing protest of people.

00:13:46.768 --> 00:13:49.119
It was especially confused

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:51.890
because in the mother country of socialism,

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.410
the Soviet Union,

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.793
a more liberal policy took place.

00:13:56.793 --> 00:13:59.210
In addition, the regime was dependent

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.602
on the loans from the West.

00:14:02.602 --> 00:14:05.150
Therefore, no order to crash down the uprising

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.227
was given to the Stasi.

00:14:08.227 --> 00:14:11.860
Secondly, in the Communist ideology,

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.513
there's no place for criticism.

00:14:14.513 --> 00:14:16.820
Instead, the leadership stuck to the belief

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.614
that socialism is a perfect system,

00:14:19.614 --> 00:14:23.865
and the Stasi had to confirm that, of course.

00:14:23.865 --> 00:14:26.226
The consequence was

00:14:26.226 --> 00:14:28.722
that despite all the information,

00:14:28.722 --> 00:14:32.886
the regime couldn't analyze its real problems,

00:14:32.886 --> 00:14:35.571
and therefore it couldn't solve them.

00:14:35.571 --> 00:14:38.275
In the end, the Stasi died

00:14:38.275 --> 00:14:40.068
because of the structures

00:14:40.068 --> 00:14:43.788
that it was charged with protecting.

00:14:43.788 --> 00:14:45.858
The ending of the Stasi

00:14:45.858 --> 00:14:47.905
was something tragic,

00:14:47.905 --> 00:14:49.964
because these officers

00:14:49.964 --> 00:14:53.032
were kept busy during the peaceful revolution

00:14:53.032 --> 00:14:55.007
with only one thing:

00:14:55.007 --> 00:14:57.660
to destroy the documents

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.351
they had produced during decades.

00:15:01.351 --> 00:15:03.269
Fortunately,

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:06.806
they had been stopped by human rights activists.

00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:09.732
That's why today we can use the files

00:15:09.732 --> 00:15:11.356
to get a better understanding

00:15:11.356 --> 00:15:14.136
of how a surveillance state functions.

00:15:14.136 --> 00:15:16.133
Thank you.

00:15:16.133 --> 00:15:20.439
(Applause)

00:15:24.518 --> 00:15:30.578
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:15:30.578 --> 00:15:33.302
So Hubertus, I want to ask you a couple of questions

00:15:33.302 --> 00:15:36.090
because I have here Der Spiegel from last week.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:40.964
"Mein Nachbar NSA." My neighbor, the NSA.

00:15:40.964 --> 00:15:43.595
And you just told us about my neighbor,

00:15:43.595 --> 00:15:46.583
the spies and the informant from East Germany.

00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:49.283
So there is a direct link between these two stories

00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:51.161
or there isn't?

00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:53.183
What's your reaction as a
historian when you see this?

00:15:53.183 --> 00:15:54.908
Hubertus Knabe: I think there are

00:15:54.908 --> 00:15:56.811
several aspects to mention.

00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:59.877
At first, I think there's a difference

00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:03.965
of why you are collecting this data.

00:16:03.965 --> 00:16:06.283
Are you doing that for protecting your people

00:16:06.283 --> 00:16:07.830
against terrorist attacks,

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.600
or are you doing that for oppressing your people?

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.542
So that makes a fundamental difference.

00:16:12.542 --> 00:16:14.891
But on the other hand,

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:19.210
also in a democracy, these
instruments can be abused,

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.376
and that is something where we really have

00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:22.761
to be aware to stop that,

00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:25.634
and that also the intelligence services

00:16:25.634 --> 00:16:28.755
are respecting the rules we have.

00:16:28.755 --> 00:16:30.255
The third point, probably,

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:33.543
we really can be happy that we live in a democracy,

00:16:33.543 --> 00:16:37.223
because you can be sure that Russia and China

00:16:37.223 --> 00:16:38.755
are doing the same,

00:16:38.755 --> 00:16:40.321
but nobody speaks about that

00:16:40.321 --> 00:16:42.612
because nobody could do that.

00:16:42.612 --> 00:16:47.576
(Applause)

00:16:49.398 --> 00:16:51.451
BG: When the story came out first,

00:16:51.451 --> 00:16:53.646
last July, last year,

00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:56.474
you filed a criminal complaint

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:59.454
with a German tribunal. Why?

00:16:59.454 --> 00:17:02.667
HK: Yeah, I did so because of
the second point I mentioned,

00:17:02.667 --> 00:17:05.564
that I think especially in a democracy,

00:17:05.564 --> 00:17:09.022
the rules are for everybody.

00:17:09.022 --> 00:17:11.386
They are made for everybody, so it's not allowed

00:17:11.386 --> 00:17:15.177
that any institution doesn't respect the rules.

00:17:15.177 --> 00:17:17.155
In the criminal code of Germany, it's written

00:17:17.155 --> 00:17:19.010
that it's not allowed to tap somebody

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.398
without the permission of the judge.

00:17:21.398 --> 00:17:25.219
Fortunately, it's written in
the criminal code of Germany,

00:17:25.219 --> 00:17:29.150
so if it's not respected, then I think

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.046
an investigation is necessary,

00:17:31.046 --> 00:17:33.025
and it took a very long time that

00:17:33.025 --> 00:17:35.131
the public prosecutor of Germany started this,

00:17:35.131 --> 00:17:38.702
and he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel,

00:17:38.702 --> 00:17:41.658
and not in the case of all the
other people living in Germany.

00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:44.131
BG: That doesn't surprise me because —

00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:46.254
(Applause) —

00:17:46.254 --> 00:17:49.697
because of the story you told.

00:17:49.697 --> 00:17:52.180
Seen from the outside, I live outside of Germany,

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.957
and I expected the Germans to react

00:17:53.957 --> 00:17:57.177
much more strongly, immediately.

00:17:57.177 --> 00:17:59.789
And instead, the reaction really came only

00:17:59.789 --> 00:18:01.646
when Chancellor Merkel was revealed

00:18:01.646 --> 00:18:05.201
as being wiretapped. Why so?

00:18:05.201 --> 00:18:07.064
HK: I take it as a good sign,

00:18:07.064 --> 00:18:11.394
because people feel secure in this democracy.

00:18:11.394 --> 00:18:13.608
They aren't afraid that they will be arrested,

00:18:13.608 --> 00:18:16.771
and if you leave this hall after the conference,

00:18:16.771 --> 00:18:19.335
nobody has to be afraid that the secret police

00:18:19.335 --> 00:18:21.773
is standing out and is arresting you.

00:18:21.773 --> 00:18:23.367
So that's a good sign, I think.

00:18:23.367 --> 00:18:26.242
People are not really scared, as they could be.

00:18:26.242 --> 00:18:30.596
But of course, I think, the institutions

00:18:30.596 --> 00:18:33.163
are responsible to stop illegal actions

00:18:33.163 --> 00:18:36.281
in Germany or wherever they happen.

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:39.474
BG: A personal question,
and this is the last one.

00:18:39.474 --> 00:18:41.740
There has been a debate in Germany about

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.281
granting asylum to Edward Snowden.

00:18:43.281 --> 00:18:46.046
Would you be in favor or against?

00:18:46.046 --> 00:18:47.734
HK: Oh, that's a difficult question,

00:18:47.734 --> 00:18:49.420
but if you ask me,

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.075
and if I answer honestly,

00:18:51.075 --> 00:18:52.841
I would give him the asylum,

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:54.890
because I think it was really brave what he did,

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.502
and he destroyed his whole life

00:18:57.502 --> 00:18:59.171
and his family and everything.

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:02.380
So I think, for these people,
we should do something,

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.534
and especially if you see the German history,

00:19:06.534 --> 00:19:09.031
where so many people had to escape

00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:11.347
and they asked for asylum in other countries

00:19:11.347 --> 00:19:12.730
and they didn't get it,

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.567
so it would be a good sign to give him asylum.

00:19:15.567 --> 00:19:17.378
(Applause)

00:19:17.378 --> 00:19:23.680
BG: Hubertus, thank you very much.
