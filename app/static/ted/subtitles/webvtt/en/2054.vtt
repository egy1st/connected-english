WEBVTT

00:00:00.036 --> 00:00:04.605
I didn't know when I agreed to do this

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:10.285
whether I was expected to talk or to sing.

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:15.333
But when I was told that the topic was language,

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:20.104
I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment.

00:00:20.104 --> 00:00:24.453
I have a problem.

00:00:24.453 --> 00:00:26.467
It's not the worst thing in the world.

00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:27.664
I'm fine.

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:29.413
I'm not on fire.

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:31.314
I know that other people in the world

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:35.482
have far worse things to deal with,

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:41.432
but for me, language and music are

00:00:41.432 --> 00:00:45.867
inextricably linked through this one thing.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:53.556
And the thing is that I have a stutter.

00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:56.104
It might seem curious given that I spend

00:00:56.104 --> 00:00:59.902
a lot of my life on the stage.

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:02.926
One would assume that I'm comfortable

00:01:02.926 --> 00:01:05.358
in the public sphere and comfortable here,

00:01:05.358 --> 00:01:07.798
speaking to you guys.

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:12.568
But the truth is that I've spent
my life up until this point

00:01:12.568 --> 00:01:16.919
and including this point, living in mortal dread

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:20.229
of public speaking.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.931
Public singing, whole different thing. (Laughter)

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.432
But we'll get to that in a moment.

00:01:28.432 --> 00:01:34.342
I've never really talked about it before so explicitly.

00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:36.674
I think that that's because I've always lived in hope

00:01:36.674 --> 00:01:39.218
that when I was a grown-up,

00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:45.490
I wouldn't have one.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.705
I sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown,

00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:51.912
I'll have learned to speak French,

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:55.190
and when I'm grown, I'll learn
how to manage my money,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.468
and when I'm grown, I won't have a stutter,

00:01:57.468 --> 00:01:59.791
and then I'll be able to public speak
and maybe be the prime minister

00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:03.156
and anything's possible and, you know.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:06.556
(Laughter)

00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:09.605
So I can talk about it now

00:02:09.605 --> 00:02:13.427
because I've reached this point, where —

00:02:13.427 --> 00:02:17.367
I mean, I'm 28.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:19.857
I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now.

00:02:19.857 --> 00:02:21.679
(Laughter)

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:23.681
And I'm an adult woman

00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:27.757
who spends her life as a performer,

00:02:27.757 --> 00:02:30.659
with a speech impediment.

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.867
So, I might as well come clean about it.

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:38.849
There are some interesting
angles to having a stutter.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.223
For me, the worst thing that can happen

00:02:42.223 --> 00:02:45.485
is meeting another stutterer.

00:02:45.485 --> 00:02:48.701
(Laughter)

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:51.908
This happened to me in Hamburg, when

00:02:51.908 --> 00:02:53.911
this guy, we met and he said,

00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:57.532
"Hello, m-m-m-my name is Joe,"

00:02:57.532 --> 00:03:01.793
and I said, "Oh, hello, m-m-m-my name is Meg."

00:03:01.793 --> 00:03:04.450
Imagine my horror when I realized

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.355
he thought I was making fun of him.

00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:10.450
(Laughter)

00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:17.230
People think I'm drunk all the time.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.630
(Laughter)

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.306
People think that I've forgotten their name

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:28.997
when I hesitate before saying it.

00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:31.220
And it is a very weird thing, because

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.459
proper nouns are the worst.

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.249
If I'm going to use the word
"Wednesday" in a sentence,

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.152
and I'm coming up to the word,

00:03:42.152 --> 00:03:45.121
and I can feel that I'm going to stutter or something,

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:48.431
I can change the word to "tomorrow,"

00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:50.490
or "the day after Tuesday,"

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.883
or something else.

00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:57.866
It's clunky, but you can get away with it,

00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:00.408
because over time I've developed this

00:04:00.408 --> 00:04:04.795
loophole method of using speech

00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:07.926
where right at the last minute you

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:12.207
change the thing and you trick your brain.

00:04:12.207 --> 00:04:15.915
But with people's names, you can't change them.

00:04:15.915 --> 00:04:18.593
(Laughter)

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:21.762
When I was singing a lot of jazz,

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:27.285
I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve.

00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:29.899
As you can probably gather,

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:33.173
S's and T's, together or independently,

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:36.216
are my kryptonite.

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:39.439
But I would have to introduce the band

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.651
over this rolling vamp,

00:04:42.651 --> 00:04:45.500
and when I got around to Steve,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.271
I'd often find myself stuck on the "St."

00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:56.959
And it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable 
and it totally kills the vibe.

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:59.287
So after a few instances of this,

00:04:59.287 --> 00:05:04.387
Steve happily became "Seve,"

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:08.982
and we got through it that way. (Laughter)

00:05:09.887 --> 00:05:12.238
I've had a lot of therapy,

00:05:12.238 --> 00:05:14.525
and a common form of treatment is to use

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:19.433
this technique that's called smooth speech,

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:24.858
which is where you almost
sing everything that you say.

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:27.210
You kind of join everything together in this

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.475
very singsong, kindergarten teacher way,

00:05:31.475 --> 00:05:35.454
and it makes you sound very serene,
like you've had lots of Valium,

00:05:35.454 --> 00:05:39.246
and everything is calm. (Laughter)

00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:42.373
That's not actually me.

00:05:42.373 --> 00:05:45.698
And I do use that. I do.

00:05:45.698 --> 00:05:52.532
I use it when I have to be on panel shows,

00:05:52.532 --> 00:05:55.911
or when I have to do radio interviews,

00:05:55.911 --> 00:06:00.774
when the economy of airtime is paramount.

00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:03.828
(Laughter)

00:06:03.828 --> 00:06:08.216
I get through it that way for my job.

00:06:08.216 --> 00:06:10.933
But as an artist who feels that their work

00:06:10.933 --> 00:06:16.903
is based solely on a platform of honesty

00:06:16.903 --> 00:06:20.937
and being real,

00:06:20.937 --> 00:06:24.671
that feels often like cheating.

00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:27.885
Which is why before I sing, I wanted to tell you

00:06:27.885 --> 00:06:31.544
what singing means to me.

00:06:31.544 --> 00:06:35.595
It's more than making nice sounds,

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:40.997
and it's more than making nice songs.

00:06:40.997 --> 00:06:46.531
It's more than feeling known, or understood.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:52.696
It's more than making you feel the things that I feel.

00:06:52.696 --> 00:06:55.385
It's not about mythology,

00:06:55.385 --> 00:07:00.427
or mythologizing myself to you.

00:07:00.427 --> 00:07:05.805
Somehow, through some miraculous

00:07:05.805 --> 00:07:10.305
synaptic function of the human brain,

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:15.761
it's impossible to stutter when you sing.

00:07:15.761 --> 00:07:19.517
And when I was younger,
that was a method of treatment

00:07:19.517 --> 00:07:21.970
that worked very well for me,

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:27.850
singing, so I did it a lot.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.993
And that's why I'm here today.

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:36.358
(Applause)

00:07:36.358 --> 00:07:39.849
Thank you.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.583
Singing for me is sweet relief.

00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:55.430
It is the only time when I feel fluent.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.856
It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth

00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:01.448
is comprehensively exactly what I intended.

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.731
(Laughter)

00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:06.668
So I know that this is a TED Talk,

00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:10.417
but now i'm going to TED sing.

00:08:10.417 --> 00:08:11.976
This is a song that I wrote last year.

00:08:11.976 --> 00:08:14.374
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:08:14.374 --> 00:08:19.548
(Applause)
