WEBVTT

00:00:01.391 --> 00:00:03.670
You probably don't know me,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.014
but I am one of those .01 percenters

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:08.957
that you hear about and read about,

00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:13.022
and I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat.

00:00:13.022 --> 00:00:16.112
And tonight, what I would like to do is speak directly

00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:18.418
to other plutocrats, to my people,

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:21.229
because it feels like it's time for us all

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:23.305
to have a chat.

00:00:23.305 --> 00:00:25.883
Like most plutocrats, I too am a proud

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:28.226
and unapologetic capitalist.

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:31.763
I have founded, cofounded or funded

00:00:31.763 --> 00:00:35.293
over 30 companies across a range of industries.

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:38.888
I was the first non-family investor in Amazon.com.

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:41.609
I cofounded a company called aQuantive

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.479
that we sold to Microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:48.027
My friends and I, we own a bank.

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.923
I tell you this — (Laughter) —

00:00:50.923 --> 00:00:52.170
unbelievable, right?

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.380
I tell you this to show

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.143
that my life is like most plutocrats.

00:00:58.143 --> 00:01:01.450
I have a broad perspective on capitalism

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.250
and business,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.040
and I have been rewarded obscenely for that

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.197
with a life that most of you all

00:01:09.197 --> 00:01:11.456
can't even imagine:

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:14.157
multiple homes, a yacht, my own plane,

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:18.284
etc., etc., etc.

00:01:18.284 --> 00:01:21.546
But let's be honest: I am not the
smartest person you've ever met.

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:23.950
I am certainly not the hardest working.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.923
I was a mediocre student.

00:01:25.923 --> 00:01:27.141
I'm not technical at all.

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:29.639
I can't write a word of code.

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:32.772
Truly, my success is the consequence

00:01:32.772 --> 00:01:35.220
of spectacular luck,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.124
of birth, of circumstance and of timing.

00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:44.619
But I am actually pretty good at a couple of things.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.263
One, I have an unusually high tolerance for risk,

00:01:49.263 --> 00:01:51.678
and the other is I have a good sense,

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:54.303
a good intuition about what will happen in the future,

00:01:54.303 --> 00:01:57.586
and I think that that intuition about the future

00:01:57.586 --> 00:02:01.156
is the essence of good entrepreneurship.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:03.674
So what do I see in our future today,

00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:05.676
you ask?

00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:07.331
I see pitchforks,

00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:12.121
as in angry mobs with pitchforks,

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:17.335
because while people like us plutocrats

00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:20.866
are living beyond the dreams of avarice,

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:23.779
the other 99 percent of our fellow citizens

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.592
are falling farther and farther behind.

00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:29.080
In 1980, the top one percent of Americans

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.558
shared about eight percent of national [income],

00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:34.232
while the bottom 50 percent of Americans

00:02:34.232 --> 00:02:36.775
shared 18 percent.

00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:40.127
Thirty years later, today, the top one percent

00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:43.749
shares over 20 percent of national [income],

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.650
while the bottom 50 percent of Americans

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.564
share 12 or 13.

00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:51.010
If the trend continues,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.490
the top one percent will share

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.796
over 30 percent of national [income]

00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:56.588
in another 30 years,

00:02:56.588 --> 00:02:58.868
while the bottom 50 percent of Americans

00:02:58.868 --> 00:03:00.607
will share just six.

00:03:00.607 --> 00:03:02.603
You see, the problem isn't that we have

00:03:02.603 --> 00:03:04.684
some inequality.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.136
Some inequality is necessary

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:10.430
for a high-functioning capitalist democracy.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.140
The problem is that inequality

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.502
is at historic highs today

00:03:15.502 --> 00:03:18.921
and it's getting worse every day.

00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:21.545
And if wealth, power, and income

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:23.380
continue to concentrate

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.681
at the very tippy top,

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:27.529
our society will change

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.262
from a capitalist democracy

00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:33.034
to a neo-feudalist rentier society

00:03:33.034 --> 00:03:35.019
like 18th-century France.

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.213
That was France

00:03:38.213 --> 00:03:39.960
before the revolution

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.984
and the mobs with the pitchforks.

00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:44.538
So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats

00:03:44.538 --> 00:03:46.360
and zillionaires

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.834
and for anyone who lives

00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:50.070
in a gated bubble world:

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.421
Wake up.

00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:55.141
Wake up. It cannot last.

00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:57.160
Because if we do not do something

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.491
to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society,

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.236
the pitchforks will come for us,

00:04:04.236 --> 00:04:08.184
for no free and open society can long sustain

00:04:08.184 --> 00:04:11.188
this kind of rising economic inequality.

00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:14.110
It has never happened. There are no examples.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.969
You show me a highly unequal society,

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.448
and I will show you a police state

00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:19.215
or an uprising.

00:04:19.215 --> 00:04:21.358
The pitchforks will come for us

00:04:21.358 --> 00:04:23.269
if we do not address this.

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:27.117
It's not a matter of if, it's when.

00:04:27.117 --> 00:04:30.750
And it will be terrible when they come

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.201
for everyone,

00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:37.185
but particularly for people like us plutocrats.

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:40.605
I know I must sound like some liberal do-gooder.

00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:42.855
I'm not. I'm not making a moral argument

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:46.117
that economic inequality is wrong.

00:04:46.117 --> 00:04:50.403
What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality

00:04:50.403 --> 00:04:53.924
is stupid and ultimately self-defeating.

00:04:53.924 --> 00:04:57.152
Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks

00:04:57.152 --> 00:04:59.020
from pitchforks,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.587
but it's also terrible for business too.

00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:07.457
So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford.

00:05:07.457 --> 00:05:11.270
When Ford famously introduced the $5 day,

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.217
which was twice the prevailing wage at the time,

00:05:14.217 --> 00:05:16.287
he didn't just increase the productivity

00:05:16.287 --> 00:05:18.256
of his factories,

00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:21.653
he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor

00:05:21.653 --> 00:05:24.353
into a thriving middle class who could now afford

00:05:24.353 --> 00:05:27.570
to buy the products that they made.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.860
Ford intuited what we now know is true,

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.861
that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem

00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:37.780
and characterized by the same kinds

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.340
of feedback loops you find

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.080
in a natural ecosystem,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.018
a feedback loop between customers and businesses.

00:05:46.018 --> 00:05:49.124
Raising wages increases demand,

00:05:49.124 --> 00:05:51.205
which increases hiring,

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:53.286
which in turn increases wages

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:55.916
and demand and profits,

00:05:55.916 --> 00:06:00.760
and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.909
is precisely what is missing

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.904
from today's economic recovery.

00:06:07.904 --> 00:06:12.522
And this is why we need to put behind us

00:06:12.522 --> 00:06:16.230
the trickle-down policies that so dominate

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.027
both political parties

00:06:18.027 --> 00:06:21.432
and embrace something I call middle-out economics.

00:06:21.432 --> 00:06:23.967
Middle-out economics rejects

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.284
the neoclassical economic idea

00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:30.481
that economies are efficient, linear, mechanistic,

00:06:30.481 --> 00:06:33.608
that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness,

00:06:33.608 --> 00:06:37.046
and instead embraces the 21st-century idea

00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:40.820
that economies are complex, adaptive,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.822
ecosystemic,

00:06:42.822 --> 00:06:46.170
that they tend away from
equilibrium and toward inequality,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.920
that they're not efficient at all

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.205
but are effective if well managed.

00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:54.476
This 21st-century perspective

00:06:54.476 --> 00:06:57.140
allows you to clearly see that capitalism

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.427
does not work by [efficiently] allocating

00:07:00.427 --> 00:07:02.867
existing resources.

00:07:02.867 --> 00:07:08.865
It works by [efficiently] creating new solutions

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:10.120
to human problems.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.329
The genius of capitalism

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:17.211
is that it is an evolutionary solution-finding system.

00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:23.162
It rewards people for solving
other people's problems.

00:07:23.162 --> 00:07:26.109
The difference between a poor society

00:07:26.109 --> 00:07:28.426
and a rich society, obviously,

00:07:28.426 --> 00:07:31.364
is the degree to which that society

00:07:31.364 --> 00:07:33.297
has generated solutions in the form

00:07:33.297 --> 00:07:36.156
of products for its citizens.

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:37.977
The sum of the solutions

00:07:37.977 --> 00:07:39.968
that we have in our society

00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:42.342
really is our prosperity, and this explains

00:07:42.342 --> 00:07:44.625
why companies like Google and Amazon

00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:46.988
and Microsoft and Apple

00:07:46.988 --> 00:07:49.890
and the entrepreneurs who created those companies

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.450
have contributed so much

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.156
to our nation's prosperity.

00:07:56.156 --> 00:07:58.956
This 21st-century perspective

00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:01.545
also makes clear

00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:03.990
that what we think of as economic growth

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.937
is best understood as

00:08:05.937 --> 00:08:08.431
the rate at which we solve problems.

00:08:08.431 --> 00:08:11.849
But that rate is totally dependent upon

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:15.426
how many problem solvers —

00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:17.912
diverse, able problem solvers — we have,

00:08:17.912 --> 00:08:20.645
and thus how many of our fellow citizens

00:08:20.645 --> 00:08:22.870
actively participate,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.520
both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.162
and as customers who consume them.

00:08:30.162 --> 00:08:34.280
But this maximizing participation thing

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.899
doesn't happen by accident.

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:37.868
It doesn't happen by itself.

00:08:37.868 --> 00:08:41.597
It requires effort and investment,

00:08:41.597 --> 00:08:44.027
which is why all

00:08:44.027 --> 00:08:47.258
highly prosperous capitalist democracies

00:08:47.258 --> 00:08:49.807
are characterized by massive investments

00:08:49.807 --> 00:08:52.372
in the middle class and the infrastructure

00:08:52.372 --> 00:08:55.240
that they depend on.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.239
We plutocrats need to get this

00:08:57.239 --> 00:09:00.378
trickle-down economics thing behind us,

00:09:00.378 --> 00:09:02.284
this idea that the better we do,

00:09:02.284 --> 00:09:04.951
the better everyone else will do.

00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:08.871
It's not true. How could it be?

00:09:08.871 --> 00:09:12.999
I earn 1,000 times the median wage,

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:15.924
but I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff,

00:09:15.924 --> 00:09:16.988
do I?

00:09:16.988 --> 00:09:20.176
I actually bought two pairs of these pants,

00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:22.110
what my partner Mike calls

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.625
my manager pants.

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:26.561
I could have bought 2,000 pairs,

00:09:26.561 --> 00:09:29.627
but what would I do with them? (Laughter)

00:09:29.627 --> 00:09:32.656
How many haircuts can I get?

00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:36.361
How often can I go out to dinner?

00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:40.434
No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get,

00:09:40.434 --> 00:09:43.978
we can never drive a great national economy.

00:09:43.978 --> 00:09:49.671
Only a thriving middle class can do that.

00:09:49.671 --> 00:09:51.368
There's nothing to be done,

00:09:51.368 --> 00:09:55.509
my plutocrat friends might say.

00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:58.713
Henry Ford was in a different time.

00:09:58.713 --> 00:10:00.987
Maybe we can't do some things.

00:10:00.987 --> 00:10:03.923
Maybe we can do some things.

00:10:03.923 --> 00:10:07.784
June 19, 2013,

00:10:07.784 --> 00:10:11.217
Bloomberg published an article I wrote called

00:10:11.217 --> 00:10:16.150
"The Capitalist’s Case for a $15 Minimum Wage."

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.072
The good people at Forbes magazine,

00:10:19.072 --> 00:10:21.270
among my biggest admirers,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.990
called it "Nick Hanauer's near-insane proposal."

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.219
And yet, just 350 days

00:10:29.219 --> 00:10:31.795
after that article was published,

00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:34.744
Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law

00:10:34.744 --> 00:10:38.510
an ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.198
to 15 dollars an hour,

00:10:40.198 --> 00:10:41.638
more than double

00:10:41.638 --> 00:10:46.330
what the prevailing federal $7.25 rate is.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.110
How did this happen,

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.195
reasonable people might ask.

00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:51.863
It happened because a group of us

00:10:51.863 --> 00:10:53.227
reminded the middle class

00:10:53.227 --> 00:10:54.878
that they are the source

00:10:54.878 --> 00:10:58.544
of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies.

00:10:58.544 --> 00:11:02.110
We reminded them that when
workers have more money,

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.822
businesses have more customers,

00:11:03.822 --> 00:11:05.804
and need more employees.

00:11:05.804 --> 00:11:08.490
We reminded them that when businesses

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.210
pay workers a living wage,

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.102
taxpayers are relieved of the burden

00:11:13.102 --> 00:11:14.812
of funding the poverty programs

00:11:14.812 --> 00:11:17.714
like food stamps and medical assistance

00:11:17.714 --> 00:11:19.424
and rent assistance

00:11:19.424 --> 00:11:21.820
that those workers need.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.784
We reminded them that low-wage workers

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:27.110
make terrible taxpayers,

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.128
and that when you raise the minimum wage

00:11:29.128 --> 00:11:31.253
for all businesses,

00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:32.920
all businesses benefit

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.651
yet all can compete.

00:11:35.651 --> 00:11:37.372
Now the orthodox reaction, of course,

00:11:37.372 --> 00:11:41.175
is raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right?

00:11:41.175 --> 00:11:43.763
Your politician's always echoing

00:11:43.763 --> 00:11:46.855
that trickle-down idea by saying things like,

00:11:46.855 --> 00:11:48.948
"Well, if you raise the price of employment,

00:11:48.948 --> 00:11:51.740
guess what happens? You get less of it."

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.170
Are you sure?

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.823
Because there's some contravening evidence.

00:11:57.823 --> 00:12:02.582
Since 1980, the wages of CEOs in our country

00:12:02.582 --> 00:12:04.850
have gone from about 30 times the median wage

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.122
to 500 times.

00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:10.290
That's raising the price of employment.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.262
And yet, to my knowledge,

00:12:13.262 --> 00:12:15.434
I have never seen a company

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:19.180
outsource its CEO's job, automate their job,

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.267
export the job to China.

00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:23.293
In fact, we appear to be employing

00:12:23.293 --> 00:12:26.515
more CEOs and senior managers than ever before.

00:12:26.515 --> 00:12:30.705
So too for technology workers

00:12:30.705 --> 00:12:32.531
and financial services workers,

00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:35.149
who earn multiples of the median wage

00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:37.154
and yet we employ more and more of them,

00:12:37.154 --> 00:12:42.050
so clearly you can raise the price of employment

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.091
and get more of it.

00:12:44.091 --> 00:12:46.675
I know that most people

00:12:46.675 --> 00:12:48.397
think that the $15 minimum wage

00:12:48.397 --> 00:12:52.312
is this insane, risky economic experiment.

00:12:52.312 --> 00:12:54.210
We disagree.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.684
We believe that the $15 minimum wage

00:12:56.684 --> 00:12:57.950
in Seattle

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.803
is actually the continuation

00:12:59.803 --> 00:13:02.511
of a logical economic policy.

00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:04.471
It is allowing our city

00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:07.206
to kick your city's ass.

00:13:07.206 --> 00:13:08.965
Because, you see,

00:13:08.965 --> 00:13:10.677
Washington state already has

00:13:10.677 --> 00:13:12.170
the highest minimum wage

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.869
of any state in the nation.

00:13:13.869 --> 00:13:16.130
We pay all workers $9.32,

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.973
which is almost 30 percent more

00:13:17.973 --> 00:13:20.531
than the federal minimum of 7.25,

00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:24.484
but crucially, 427 percent more

00:13:24.484 --> 00:13:28.070
than the federal tipped minimum of 2.13.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.686
If trickle-down thinkers were right,

00:13:30.686 --> 00:13:33.798
then Washington state should
have massive unemployment.

00:13:33.798 --> 00:13:36.478
Seattle should be sliding into the ocean.

00:13:36.478 --> 00:13:39.501
And yet, Seattle

00:13:39.501 --> 00:13:43.399
is the fastest-growing big city in the country.

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:47.516
Washington state is generating small business jobs

00:13:47.516 --> 00:13:50.137
at a higher rate than any other major state

00:13:50.137 --> 00:13:51.993
in the nation.

00:13:51.993 --> 00:13:55.897
The restaurant business in Seattle? Booming.

00:13:55.897 --> 00:14:00.285
Why? Because the fundamental law of capitalism is,

00:14:00.285 --> 00:14:01.900
when workers have more money,

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.426
businesses have more customers

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:05.683
and need more workers.

00:14:05.683 --> 00:14:08.834
When restaurants pay restaurant workers enough

00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:12.456
so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants,

00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:15.121
that's not bad for the restaurant business.

00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:16.820
That's good for it,

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.399
despite what some restaurateurs may tell you.

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:23.457
Is it more complicated than I'm making out?

00:14:23.457 --> 00:14:24.454
Of course it is.

00:14:24.454 --> 00:14:26.322
There are a lot of dynamics at play.

00:14:26.322 --> 00:14:28.564
But can we please stop insisting

00:14:28.564 --> 00:14:31.365
that if low-wage workers earn a little bit more,

00:14:31.365 --> 00:14:32.873
unemployment will skyrocket

00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:34.201
and the economy will collapse?

00:14:34.201 --> 00:14:36.810
There is no evidence for it.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.041
The most insidious thing

00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:39.888
about trickle-down economics

00:14:39.888 --> 00:14:42.190
is not the claim that if the rich get richer,

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.727
everyone is better off.

00:14:43.727 --> 00:14:46.788
It is the claim made by those who oppose

00:14:46.788 --> 00:14:48.690
any increase in the minimum wage

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.545
that if the poor get richer,

00:14:50.545 --> 00:14:52.762
that will be bad for the economy.

00:14:52.762 --> 00:14:54.742
This is nonsense.

00:14:54.742 --> 00:14:58.607
So can we please dispense with this rhetoric

00:14:58.607 --> 00:15:00.950
that says that rich guys like me

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.804
and my plutocrat friends

00:15:03.804 --> 00:15:06.377
made our country?

00:15:06.377 --> 00:15:08.452
We plutocrats know,

00:15:08.452 --> 00:15:10.076
even if we don't like to admit it in public,

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.745
that if we had been born somewhere else,

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.642
not here in the United States,

00:15:14.642 --> 00:15:17.502
we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot

00:15:17.502 --> 00:15:20.652
by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.

00:15:20.652 --> 00:15:23.183
It's not that they don't have good
entrepreneurs in other places,

00:15:23.183 --> 00:15:25.208
even very, very poor places.

00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:26.760
It's just that that's all

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.296
that those entrepreneurs' customers can afford.

00:15:31.296 --> 00:15:35.895
So here's an idea for a new kind of economics,

00:15:35.895 --> 00:15:37.442
a new kind of politics

00:15:37.442 --> 00:15:40.329
that I call new capitalism.

00:15:40.329 --> 00:15:42.801
Let's acknowledge that capitalism

00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:44.598
beats the alternatives,

00:15:44.598 --> 00:15:48.595
but also that the more people we include,

00:15:48.595 --> 00:15:52.119
both as entrepreneurs and as customers,

00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:54.279
the better it works.

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:58.065
Let's by all means shrink the size of government,

00:15:58.065 --> 00:16:00.784
but not by slashing the poverty programs,

00:16:00.784 --> 00:16:02.801
but by ensuring that workers are paid enough

00:16:02.801 --> 00:16:06.123
so that they actually don't need those programs.

00:16:06.123 --> 00:16:09.040
Let's invest enough in the middle class

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.233
to make our economy fairer and more inclusive,

00:16:12.233 --> 00:16:16.167
and by fairer, more truly competitive,

00:16:16.167 --> 00:16:17.929
and by more truly competitive,

00:16:17.929 --> 00:16:20.745
more able to generate the solutions

00:16:20.745 --> 00:16:22.217
to human problems

00:16:22.217 --> 00:16:27.847
that are the true drivers of growth and prosperity.

00:16:27.847 --> 00:16:31.120
Capitalism is the greatest social technology

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.589
ever invented

00:16:32.589 --> 00:16:35.451
for creating prosperity in human societies,

00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:37.185
if it is well managed,

00:16:37.185 --> 00:16:40.356
but capitalism, because of the fundamental

00:16:40.356 --> 00:16:43.121
multiplicative dynamics of complex systems,

00:16:43.121 --> 00:16:46.649
tends towards, inexorably, inequality,

00:16:46.649 --> 00:16:51.070
concentration and collapse.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.518
The work of democracies

00:16:53.518 --> 00:16:58.021
is to maximize the inclusion of the many

00:16:58.021 --> 00:17:00.998
in order to create prosperity,

00:17:00.998 --> 00:17:04.920
not to enable the few to accumulate money.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.020
Government does create prosperity and growth,

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.246
by creating the conditions that allow

00:17:11.246 --> 00:17:14.137
both entrepreneurs and their customers

00:17:14.137 --> 00:17:15.982
to thrive.

00:17:15.982 --> 00:17:19.166
Balancing the power of capitalists like me

00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:22.338
and workers isn't bad for capitalism.

00:17:22.338 --> 00:17:24.138
It's essential to it.

00:17:24.138 --> 00:17:26.804
Programs like a reasonable minimum wage,

00:17:26.804 --> 00:17:28.818
affordable healthcare,

00:17:28.818 --> 00:17:30.121
paid sick leave,

00:17:30.121 --> 00:17:33.540
and the progressive taxation necessary

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.736
to pay for the important infrastructure

00:17:35.736 --> 00:17:39.787
necessary for the middle class like education, R and D,

00:17:39.787 --> 00:17:42.353
these are indispensable tools

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:44.462
shrewd capitalists should embrace

00:17:44.462 --> 00:17:48.448
to drive growth, because no one benefits from it

00:17:48.448 --> 00:17:50.094
like us.

00:17:50.094 --> 00:17:52.342
Many economists would have you believe

00:17:52.342 --> 00:17:55.422
that their field is an objective science.

00:17:55.422 --> 00:17:58.269
I disagree, and I think that it is equally

00:17:58.269 --> 00:18:00.338
a tool that humans use

00:18:00.338 --> 00:18:02.227
to enforce and encode

00:18:02.227 --> 00:18:05.803
our social and moral preferences and prejudices

00:18:05.803 --> 00:18:09.705
about status and power,

00:18:09.705 --> 00:18:11.982
which is why plutocrats like me

00:18:11.982 --> 00:18:15.988
have always needed to find persuasive stories

00:18:15.988 --> 00:18:17.662
to tell everyone else

00:18:17.662 --> 00:18:21.776
about why our relative positions

00:18:21.776 --> 00:18:25.908
are morally righteous and good for everyone:

00:18:25.908 --> 00:18:30.183
like, we are indispensable, the job creators,

00:18:30.183 --> 00:18:32.545
and you are not;

00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:35.931
like, tax cuts for us create growth,

00:18:35.931 --> 00:18:37.945
but investments in you

00:18:37.945 --> 00:18:39.621
will balloon our debt

00:18:39.621 --> 00:18:42.129
and bankrupt our great country;

00:18:42.129 --> 00:18:43.997
that we matter;

00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:46.348
that you don't.

00:18:46.348 --> 00:18:48.991
For thousands of years, these stories were called

00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:50.439
divine right.

00:18:50.439 --> 00:18:54.693
Today, we have trickle-down economics.

00:18:54.693 --> 00:18:58.576
How obviously, transparently self-serving

00:18:58.576 --> 00:19:00.170
all of this is.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.952
We plutocrats need to see

00:19:02.952 --> 00:19:05.305
that the United States of America made us,

00:19:05.305 --> 00:19:06.989
not the other way around;

00:19:06.989 --> 00:19:09.827
that a thriving middle class is the source

00:19:09.827 --> 00:19:12.123
of prosperity in capitalist economies,

00:19:12.123 --> 00:19:14.762
not a consequence of it.

00:19:14.762 --> 00:19:17.453
And we should never forget

00:19:17.453 --> 00:19:21.148
that even the best of us in
the worst of circumstances

00:19:21.148 --> 00:19:26.882
are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.

00:19:26.882 --> 00:19:29.496
Fellow plutocrats, I think it may be time for us

00:19:29.496 --> 00:19:31.699
to recommit to our country,

00:19:31.699 --> 00:19:34.261
to commit to a new kind of capitalism

00:19:34.261 --> 00:19:38.615
which is both more inclusive and more effective,

00:19:38.615 --> 00:19:40.673
a capitalism that will ensure

00:19:40.673 --> 00:19:43.834
that America's economy remains

00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:47.220
the most dynamic and prosperous in the world.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.380
Let's secure the future for ourselves,

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.114
our children and their children.

00:19:52.114 --> 00:19:55.162
Or alternatively, we could do nothing,

00:19:55.162 --> 00:19:57.243
hide in our gated communities

00:19:57.243 --> 00:20:00.100
and private schools,

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.136
enjoy our planes and yachts

00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:04.476
— they're fun —

00:20:04.476 --> 00:20:06.287
and wait for the pitchforks.

00:20:06.287 --> 00:20:07.810
Thank you.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.457
(Applause)
