00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.739
As a kid I always loved information

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:05.587
that I could get from data

00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:08.629
and the stories that could be told with numbers.

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.913
I remember, growing up, I'd be frustrated at

00:00:10.913 --> 00:00:16.459
how my own parents would lie to me using numbers.

00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:21.443
"Talithia, if I've told you once 
I've told you a thousand times."

00:00:21.443 --> 00:00:25.335
No dad, you've only told me 17 times

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:28.497
and twice it wasn't my fault. (Laughter)

00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:31.661
I think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics.

00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:32.569
I always wanted to know,

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:35.755
what are people trying to hide with numbers?

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:36.938
As a statistician,

00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:40.791
I want people to show me the data

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.126
so I can decide for myself.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:46.175
Donald and I were pregnant with our third child

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:48.909
and we were at about 41 and a half weeks,

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.286
what some of you may refer to as being overdue.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:54.121
Statisticians, we call that

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.807
being within the 95 percent confidence interval.

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:58.673
(Laughter)

00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:00.951
And at this point in the process

00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:03.144
we had to come in every couple of days

00:01:03.144 --> 00:01:04.952
to do a stress test on the baby,

00:01:04.952 --> 00:01:06.134
and this is just routine,

00:01:06.134 --> 00:01:10.720
it tests whether or not the baby 
is feeling any type of undue stress.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.113
And you are rarely, if ever, seen by your actual doctor,

00:01:14.113 --> 00:01:17.280
just whoever happens to be 
working at the hospital that day.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.026
So we go in for a stress test and after 20 minutes

00:01:20.026 --> 00:01:23.524
the doctor comes out and he says,

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:29.079
"Your baby is under stress, we need to induce you."

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.698
Now, as a statistician, what's my response?

00:01:33.698 --> 00:01:37.370
Show me the data!

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.072
So then he proceeds to tell us

00:01:40.072 --> 00:01:42.497
the baby's heart rate trace went from 18 minutes,

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:44.468
the baby's heart rate was in the normal zone

00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:47.421
and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be

00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:51.131
my heart rate zone and I said,

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:53.497
"Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate?

00:01:53.497 --> 00:01:55.492
I was moving around a little bit,

00:01:55.492 --> 00:01:57.790
it's hard to lay still on your back,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.308
41 weeks pregnant for 20 minutes.

00:02:00.308 --> 00:02:02.481
Maybe it was shifting around."

00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:07.457
He said, "Well, we don't want to take any chances."

00:02:07.457 --> 00:02:08.717
I said okay.

00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:10.436
I said, "What if I was at 36 weeks

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:12.245
with this same data?

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:16.124
Would your decision be to induce?"

00:02:16.124 --> 00:02:19.692
"Well, no, I would wait until you were at least

00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:21.702
38 weeks, but you are almost 42,

00:02:21.702 --> 00:02:23.709
there is no reason to leave that baby inside,

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.660
let's get you a room."

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.241
I said, "Well, why don't we just do it again?

00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:33.962
We can collect more data.

00:02:33.962 --> 00:02:36.373
I can try to be really still for 20 minutes.

00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:39.056
We can average the two and see

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:41.738
what that means. (Laughter)

00:02:41.738 --> 00:02:45.385
And he goes,

00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:52.434
"Ma'am, I just don't want you to have a miscarriage."

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:55.566
That makes three of us.

00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:56.720
And then he says,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.838
"Your chances of having a miscarriage double

00:03:00.838 --> 00:03:04.605
when you go past your due date. Let's get you a room."

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:10.892
Wow. So now as a statistician, what's my response?

00:03:10.892 --> 00:03:12.240
Show me the data!

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.445
Dude, you're talking chances,

00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:15.701
I do chances all day long, tell me all about chances.

00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:17.523
Let's talk chances. (Laughter)

00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:19.488
Let's talk chances.

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:20.689
So I say, "Okay, great.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.590
Do I go from a 30-percent 
chance to a 60-percent chance?

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.141
Where are we here with this miscarriage thing?

00:03:27.141 --> 00:03:30.437
And he goes, "Not quite, but it doubles,

00:03:30.437 --> 00:03:35.419
and we really just want what's best for the baby."

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.582
Undaunted, I try a different angle.

00:03:37.582 --> 00:03:43.089
I said, "Okay, out of 1,000 full-term pregnant women,

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:45.616
how many of them are going to miscarry

00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:47.411
just before their due date?

00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:50.259
And then he looks at me and looks at Donald,

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:54.962
and he goes, about one in 1,000.

00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:57.792
I said, "Okay, so of those 1,000 women, how many

00:03:57.792 --> 00:04:02.650
are going to miscarry just after their due date?"

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.222
"About two." (Laughter)

00:04:06.222 --> 00:04:08.266
I said, "Okay, so you are telling me that my chances

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:12.213
go from a 0.1-percent chance

00:04:12.213 --> 00:04:16.459
to a 0.2-percent chance."

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.757
Okay, so at this point the data is not convincing us

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:20.385
that we need to be induced,

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.334
and so then we proceed to have a conversation

00:04:22.334 --> 00:04:24.982
about how inductions lead to a higher rate

00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:28.973
of Cesarean sections, and if at all 
possible we'd like to avoid that.

00:04:28.973 --> 00:04:30.225
And then I said,

00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:33.105
"And I really don't think my due date is accurate."

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:35.705
(Laughter)

00:04:35.705 --> 00:04:38.445
And so this really stunned him

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.095
and he looked sort of puzzled

00:04:40.095 --> 00:04:42.227
and I said, "You may not know this,

00:04:42.227 --> 00:04:43.808
but pregnancy due dates are calculated

00:04:43.808 --> 00:04:46.346
assuming that you have a standard 28-day cycle,

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:47.748
and my cycle ranges —

00:04:47.748 --> 00:04:51.295
sometimes it's 27, sometimes it's up to 38 —

00:04:51.295 --> 00:04:54.449
and I have been collecting the data to prove it.

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.233
(Laughter)

00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:04.070
And so we ended up leaving the hospital 
that day without being induced.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.263
We actually had to sign a waiver 
to walk out of the hospital.

00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:13.951
And I'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors,

00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:15.869
because even with our first child,

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:19.511
we were induced at 38 weeks; cervical fluid was low.

00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:21.969
I'm not anti-medical intervention.

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.833
But why were confident to leave that day?

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:28.483
Well, we had data that told a different story.

00:05:28.483 --> 00:05:33.491
We had been collecting data for six years.

00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:35.789
I had this temperature data,

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.064
and it told a different story.

00:05:37.064 --> 00:05:44.477
In fact, we could probably pretty 
accurately estimate conception.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.379
Yeah, that's a story you want to tell

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.631
at your kid's wedding reception. (Laughter)

00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:53.324
I remember like it was yesterday.

00:05:53.324 --> 00:05:55.965
My temperature was a sizzling 97.8 degrees

00:05:55.965 --> 00:06:00.119
as I stared into your father's eyes. (Laughter)

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:06.931
Oh, yeah. Twenty-two more years, we're telling that story.

00:06:06.931 --> 00:06:09.982
But we were confident to leave 
because we had been collecting data.

00:06:09.984 --> 00:06:11.590
Now, what does that data look like?

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.427
Here's a standard chart

00:06:14.427 --> 00:06:17.729
of a woman's waking body temperature

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.246
during the course of a cycle.

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:20.699
So from the beginning of the menstrual cycle

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.051
till the beginning of the next.

00:06:22.051 --> 00:06:24.872
You'll see that the temperature is not random.

00:06:24.872 --> 00:06:26.936
Clearly there is a low pattern

00:06:26.936 --> 00:06:28.935
at the beginning of her cycle

00:06:28.935 --> 00:06:31.434
and then you see this jump and then a higher

00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:33.712
set of temperatures at the end of her cycle.

00:06:33.712 --> 00:06:35.133
So what's happening here?

00:06:35.133 --> 00:06:37.739
What is that data telling you?

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:40.438
Well, ladies, at the beginning of our cycle,

00:06:40.438 --> 00:06:43.780
the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.589
causes a suppression of your body temperature.

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:51.126
And at ovulation, your body releases an egg

00:06:51.126 --> 00:06:56.141
and progesterone takes over, pro-gestation.

00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:58.493
And so your body heats up in anticipation

00:06:58.493 --> 00:07:02.279
of housing this new little fertilized egg.

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.011
So why this temperature jump?

00:07:05.011 --> 00:07:08.687
Well, think about when a bird sits on her eggs.

00:07:08.687 --> 00:07:10.153
Why is she sitting on them?

00:07:10.153 --> 00:07:12.090
She wants to keep them warm,

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.594
protect them and keep them warm.

00:07:13.594 --> 00:07:15.865
Ladies, this is exactly what our bodies do every month,

00:07:15.865 --> 00:07:17.956
they heat up in anticipation

00:07:17.956 --> 00:07:21.092
of keeping a new little life warm.

00:07:21.092 --> 00:07:24.022
And if nothing happens, if you are not pregnant,

00:07:24.022 --> 00:07:28.564
then estrogen takes back over and 
that cycle starts all over again.

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:30.511
But if you do get pregnant, sometimes you

00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:33.055
actually see another shift in your temperatures

00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:36.342
and it stays elevated for those whole nine months.

00:07:36.342 --> 00:07:39.667
That's why you see those pregnant 
women just sweating and hot,

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:43.045
because their temperatures are high.

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:47.414
Here's a chart that we had about three or four years ago.

00:07:47.414 --> 00:07:49.434
We were really very excited about this chart.

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:51.970
You'll see the low temperature level

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.012
and then a shift and for about five days,

00:07:55.012 --> 00:07:57.471
that's about the time it takes for the egg to travel

00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.918
down the fallopian tube and implant,

00:07:59.918 --> 00:08:03.559
and then you see those temperatures 
start to go up a little bit.

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:06.772
And in fact, we had a second temperature shift,

00:08:06.772 --> 00:08:10.832
confirmed with a pregnancy test 
that were indeed pregnant

00:08:10.832 --> 00:08:13.913
with our first child, very exciting.

00:08:13.913 --> 00:08:15.944
Until a couple of days later

00:08:15.944 --> 00:08:20.885
I saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow,

00:08:20.885 --> 00:08:25.244
and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage.

00:08:25.244 --> 00:08:29.114
Had I not been taking my temperature

00:08:29.114 --> 00:08:33.012
I really would have just thought 
my period was late that month,

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:34.820
but we actually had data to show

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.447
that we had miscarried this baby,

00:08:37.447 --> 00:08:39.280
and even though this data revealed a really

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.064
unfortunate event in our lives,

00:08:41.064 --> 00:08:43.531
it was information that we could then take to our doctor.

00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:46.159
So if there was a fertility issue or some problem,

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.414
I had data to show:

00:08:47.414 --> 00:08:49.761
Look, we got pregnant, our temperature shifted,

00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:51.445
we somehow lost this baby.

00:08:51.445 --> 00:08:54.805
What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem?

00:08:54.805 --> 00:08:58.326
And it's not just about temperatures

00:08:58.326 --> 00:09:01.067
and it's not just about fertility;

00:09:01.067 --> 00:09:04.955
we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things.

00:09:04.955 --> 00:09:08.785
For instance, did you know that taking 
your temperature can tell you a lot

00:09:08.785 --> 00:09:10.924
about the condition of your thyroid?

00:09:10.924 --> 00:09:14.939
So, your thyroid works a lot like 
the thermostat in your house.

00:09:14.939 --> 00:09:17.157
There is an optimal temperature 
that you want in your house;

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:18.681
you set your thermostat.

00:09:18.681 --> 00:09:21.175
When it gets too cold in the house,
your thermostat kicks in

00:09:21.175 --> 00:09:24.393
and says, "Hey, we need to blow some heat around."

00:09:24.393 --> 00:09:26.062
Or if it gets too hot, your thermostat

00:09:26.062 --> 00:09:29.619
registers, "Turn the A.C. on. Cool us off."

00:09:29.619 --> 00:09:33.416
That's exactly how your thyroid works in your body.

00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:36.116
Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature

00:09:36.116 --> 00:09:37.144
for your body.

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:39.626
If it gets too cold, your thyroid 
says, "Hey, we need to heat up."

00:09:39.626 --> 00:09:42.814
If it gets too hot, your thyroid cools you down.

00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:47.220
But what happens when your 
thyroid is not functioning well?

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.587
When it doesn't function, then it shows up

00:09:49.587 --> 00:09:50.773
in your body temperatures,

00:09:50.773 --> 00:09:53.428
they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic.

00:09:53.428 --> 00:09:54.698
And so by collecting this data

00:09:54.698 --> 00:09:57.685
you can find out information about your thyroid.

00:09:57.685 --> 00:10:01.249
Now, what is it, if you had a thyroid 
problem and you went to the doctor,

00:10:01.249 --> 00:10:03.682
your doctor would actually test the amount of

00:10:03.682 --> 00:10:06.620
thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.803
Fine. But the problem with that test is

00:10:10.803 --> 00:10:13.568
it doesn't tell you how active the hormone is in your body.

00:10:13.568 --> 00:10:15.617
So you might have a lot of hormone present,

00:10:15.617 --> 00:10:17.365
but it might not be actively working to regulate

00:10:17.365 --> 00:10:18.613
your body temperature.

00:10:18.613 --> 00:10:20.362
So just by collecting your temperature every day,

00:10:20.362 --> 00:10:23.982
you get information about the condition of your thyroid.

00:10:23.982 --> 00:10:26.463
So, what if you don't want to take 
your temperature every day?

00:10:26.463 --> 00:10:28.021
I advocate that you do,

00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:29.876
but there are tons of other things you could take.

00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:32.681
You could take your blood pressure, 
you could take your weight —

00:10:32.681 --> 00:10:34.271
yeah, who's excited about

00:10:34.271 --> 00:10:37.808
taking their weight every day? (Laughter)

00:10:37.808 --> 00:10:42.599
Early on in our marriage, Donald had a stuffy nose

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:45.719
and he had been taking a slew of medications

00:10:45.719 --> 00:10:49.718
to try to relieve his stuffy nose, to no avail.

00:10:49.718 --> 00:10:53.957
And so, that night he comes and 
he wakes me up and he says,

00:10:53.957 --> 00:10:57.764
"Honey, I can't breath out of my nose."

00:10:57.764 --> 00:11:02.582
And I roll over and I look, and I said, 
"Well, can you breath out of your mouth?"

00:11:02.582 --> 00:11:04.060
(Laughter)

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:11.140
And he goes, "Yes, but I can't breath out of my nose!"

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.160
And so like any good wife, I rush him

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.995
to the emergency room

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:18.427
at 2 o'clock in the morning.

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:21.897
And the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking,

00:11:21.897 --> 00:11:24.746
you can't die on me now.

00:11:24.746 --> 00:11:26.916
We just got married,

00:11:26.916 --> 00:11:31.374
people will think I killed you! (Laughter)

00:11:31.374 --> 00:11:35.047
And so, we get to the emergency 
room, and the nurse sees us,

00:11:35.047 --> 00:11:37.668
and he can't breath out of his nose, and so

00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:39.751
she brings us to the back and the doctor says,

00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:42.940
"What seems to be the problem?" and 
he goes, "I can't breath out of my nose."

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.989
And he said, "You can't breath out of your nose?

00:11:44.989 --> 00:11:50.866
No, but he can breath out of his mouth. (Laughter)

00:11:50.866 --> 00:11:53.508
He takes a step back and he looks at both of us

00:11:53.508 --> 00:11:57.374
and he says "Sir, I think I know the problem.

00:11:57.374 --> 00:11:58.810
You're having a heart attack.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.861
I'm going to order an EKG and a CAT scan

00:12:00.861 --> 00:12:04.203
for you immediately."

00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:05.831
And we are thinking,

00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:08.771
no, no, no. It's not a heart attack. He can breathe,

00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:13.768
just out of his mouth. No, no, no, no, no.

00:12:13.768 --> 00:12:16.031
And so we go back and forth with this doctor

00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:18.509
because we think this is the incorrect diagnosis,

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:22.461
and he's like, "No really, it'll be fine, just calm down."

00:12:22.461 --> 00:12:26.380
And I'm thinking, how do you calm down? 
But I don't think he's having a heart attack.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.621
And so fortunately for us, this 
doctor was at the end of the shift.

00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:32.536
So this new doctor comes in, he sees us clearly

00:12:32.536 --> 00:12:35.537
distraught, with a husband who can't breath

00:12:35.537 --> 00:12:38.639
out of his nose. (Laughter)

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.425
And he starts asking us questions.

00:12:41.425 --> 00:12:46.305
He says, "Well, do you two exercise?"

00:12:46.305 --> 00:12:53.378
We ride our bikes, we go to the gym occasionally.

00:12:53.378 --> 00:12:55.031
(Laughter)

00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:57.896
We move around.

00:12:57.896 --> 00:13:00.559
And he says, "What were you doing 
just before you came here?"

00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:03.271
I'm thinking, I was sleeping, honestly.

00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:06.102
But okay, what was Donald doing just before?

00:13:06.102 --> 00:13:09.650
So Donald goes into this slew 
of medications he was taking.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.612
He lists, "I took this decongestant 
and then I took this nasal spray,"

00:13:12.612 --> 00:13:14.607
and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says,

00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:18.242
"Oh! You should never mix this 
decongestant with this nasal spray.

00:13:18.242 --> 00:13:21.059
Clogs you up every time. Here, take this one instead."

00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:23.325
He gives us a prescription.

00:13:23.325 --> 00:13:25.315
We're looking at each other, and I looked at the doctor,

00:13:25.315 --> 00:13:27.541
and I said, "Why is it that it seems like you

00:13:27.541 --> 00:13:29.952
were able to accurately diagnose his condition,

00:13:29.952 --> 00:13:32.168
but this previous doctor wanted to order

00:13:32.168 --> 00:13:34.674
an EKG and a CAT scan?"

00:13:34.674 --> 00:13:37.281
And he looks at us and says,

00:13:37.281 --> 00:13:41.499
"Well, when a 350-pound man walks in the 
emergency room and says he can't breath,

00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:43.263
you assume he's having a heart attack

00:13:43.263 --> 00:13:47.212
and you ask questions later."

00:13:47.212 --> 00:13:52.932
Now, emergency room doctors are 
trained to make decisions quickly,

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:55.023
but not always accurately.

00:13:55.023 --> 00:13:56.572
And so had we had some information

00:13:56.572 --> 00:13:58.966
about our heart health to share with him,

00:13:58.966 --> 00:14:02.741
maybe we would have gotten a 
better diagnosis the first time.

00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:04.973
I want you to consider the following chart,

00:14:04.973 --> 00:14:06.927
of systolic blood pressure measurements

00:14:06.927 --> 00:14:10.999
from October 2010 to July 2012.

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:12.692
You'll see that these measurements start

00:14:12.692 --> 00:14:16.360
in the prehypertension/hypertension zone,

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.946
but over about the course of a year and a half

00:14:18.946 --> 00:14:21.591
they move into the normal zone.

00:14:21.591 --> 00:14:25.700
This is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.731
What story is this data telling you?

00:14:29.731 --> 00:14:32.612
Obviously it's the data from someone

00:14:32.612 --> 00:14:35.285
who's made a drastic transformation,

00:14:35.285 --> 00:14:40.443
and fortunately for us, that person 
happens to be here today.

00:14:40.443 --> 00:14:44.697
So that 350-pound guy that walked 
into the emergency room with me

00:14:44.697 --> 00:14:47.669
is now an even sexier and healthier

00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:54.357
225-pound guy, and that's his blood pressure trace.

00:14:54.357 --> 00:14:57.818
So over the course of that year and a half

00:14:57.818 --> 00:14:59.387
Donald's eating changed

00:14:59.387 --> 00:15:01.378
and our exercise regimen changed,

00:15:01.378 --> 00:15:04.168
and his heart rate responded,

00:15:04.168 --> 00:15:05.670
his blood pressure responded to that change

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.969
that he made in his body.

00:15:07.969 --> 00:15:09.947
So what's the take-home message

00:15:09.947 --> 00:15:13.661
that I want you to leave with today?

00:15:13.661 --> 00:15:18.035
By taking ownership of your data just like we've done,

00:15:18.035 --> 00:15:21.982
just by taking this daily measurements about yourself,

00:15:21.982 --> 00:15:24.491
you become the expert on your body.

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:26.493
You become the authority.

00:15:26.493 --> 00:15:28.916
It's not hard to do.

00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:30.836
You don't have to have a Ph.D. in statistics

00:15:30.836 --> 00:15:32.168
to be an expert in yourself.

00:15:32.168 --> 00:15:33.609
You don't have to have a medical degree

00:15:33.609 --> 00:15:35.735
to be your body's expert.

00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:39.154
Medical doctors, they're experts on the population,

00:15:39.154 --> 00:15:41.432
but you are the expert on yourself.

00:15:41.432 --> 00:15:43.342
And so when two of you come together,

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:45.312
when two experts come together,

00:15:45.312 --> 00:15:48.107
the two of you are able to make a better decision

00:15:48.107 --> 00:15:50.107
than just your doctor alone.

00:15:50.107 --> 00:15:53.874
Now that you understand the power of information

00:15:53.874 --> 00:15:55.745
that you can get through personal data collection,

00:15:55.745 --> 00:15:59.414
I'd like you all to stand and raise your right hand.

00:15:59.414 --> 00:16:01.973
(Laughter)

00:16:01.973 --> 00:16:04.093
Yes, get it up.

00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:13.679
I challenge you to take ownership of your data.

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:17.241
And today, I hereby confer upon you

00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:21.586
a TEDx associate's degree in elementary statistics

00:16:21.586 --> 00:16:26.030
with a concentration in time-dependent data analysis

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.743
with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto.

00:16:29.743 --> 00:16:33.219
And so the next time you are in your doctor's office,

00:16:33.219 --> 00:16:36.410
as newly inducted statisticians,

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.920
what should always be your response?

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.752
Audience: Show me the data! 
Talithia Williams: I can't hear you!

00:16:40.752 --> 00:16:42.520
Audience: Show me the data!

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.828
TW: One more time!

00:16:43.828 --> 00:16:45.367
Audience: Show me the data!

00:16:45.367 --> 00:16:46.549
TW: Show me the data.

00:16:46.549 --> 00:16:49.570
Thank you.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:54.370
(Applause)
