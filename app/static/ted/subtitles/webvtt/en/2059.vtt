00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.750
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.636
in a 1968 speech where he reflects
upon the Civil Rights Movement,

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:09.330
states, "In the end,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.413
we will remember not the words of our enemies

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:15.280
but the silence of our friends."

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.800
As a teacher, I've internalized this message.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.780
Every day, all around us,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.456
we see the consequences of silence

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:23.893
manifest themselves in the form of discrimination,

00:00:23.893 --> 00:00:27.701
violence, genocide and war.

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:29.897
In the classroom, I challenge my students

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:32.328
to explore the silences in their own lives

00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:34.178
through poetry.

00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:36.030
We work together to fill those spaces,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.308
to recognize them, to name them,

00:00:39.308 --> 00:00:42.740
to understand that they don't
have to be sources of shame.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.203
In an effort to create a culture within my classroom

00:00:45.203 --> 00:00:47.301
where students feel safe sharing the intimacies

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:49.135
of their own silences,

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:51.216
I have four core principles posted on the board

00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:53.309
that sits in the front of my class,

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.370
which every student signs
at the beginning of the year:

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.543
read critically, write consciously,

00:00:58.543 --> 00:01:02.408
speak clearly, tell your truth.

00:01:02.408 --> 00:01:04.972
And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point,

00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:06.871
tell your truth.

00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.665
And I realized that

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:10.876
if I was going to ask my students to speak up,

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:13.014
I was going to have to tell my truth

00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:15.280
and be honest with them about the times

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.848
where I failed to do so.

00:01:16.848 --> 00:01:18.908
So I tell them that growing up,

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:21.576
as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans,

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:24.438
during Lent I was always taught

00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:26.246
that the most meaningful thing one could do

00:01:26.246 --> 00:01:27.788
was to give something up,

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.080
sacrifice something you typically indulge in

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.479
to prove to God you understand his sanctity.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.281
I've given up soda, McDonald's, French fries,

00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:38.183
French kisses, and everything in between.

00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:42.071
But one year, I gave up speaking.

00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:44.674
I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice

00:01:44.674 --> 00:01:48.375
was my own voice, but it was like I hadn't realized

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.286
that I had given that up a long time ago.

00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:53.105
I spent so much of my life

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:55.282
telling people the things they wanted to hear

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:56.758
instead of the things they needed to,

00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:59.174
told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience

00:01:59.174 --> 00:02:01.469
because I still had to figure out being my own,

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.701
so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything,

00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:07.150
appeasing ignorance with my silence,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.547
unaware that validation doesn't need words

00:02:09.547 --> 00:02:11.167
to endorse its existence.

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:12.955
When Christian was beat up for being gay,

00:02:12.955 --> 00:02:14.223
I put my hands in my pocket

00:02:14.223 --> 00:02:17.000
and walked with my head
down as if I didn't even notice.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.535
I couldn't use my locker for weeks
because the bolt on the lock

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:21.796
reminded me of the one I had put on my lips

00:02:21.796 --> 00:02:23.540
when the homeless man on the corner

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.320
looked at me with eyes up merely searching

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.502
for an affirmation that he was worth seeing.

00:02:27.502 --> 00:02:29.607
I was more concerned with
touching the screen on my Apple

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:31.170
than actually feeding him one.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.857
When the woman at the fundraising gala

00:02:32.857 --> 00:02:34.049
said "I'm so proud of you.

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.120
It must be so hard teaching
those poor, unintelligent kids,"

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.719
I bit my lip, because apparently
we needed her money


00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.699
more than my students needed their dignity.

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.640
We spend so much time

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.540
listening to the things people are saying

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.878
that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't.

00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:54.139
Silence is the residue of fear.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.689
It is feeling your flaws

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.615
gut-wrench guillotine your tongue.

00:02:57.615 --> 00:02:59.437
It is the air retreating from your chest

00:02:59.437 --> 00:03:01.429
because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs.

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.553
Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina.

00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:07.661
It is what you hear when there
aren't enough body bags left.

00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:10.062
It is the sound after the noose is already tied.

00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:13.409
It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.164
There is no time to pick your battles

00:03:15.164 --> 00:03:16.897
when your battles have already picked you.

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:19.960
I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.927
I will tell Christian that he is a lion,

00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:24.287
a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance.

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:26.683
I will ask that homeless man what his name is

00:03:26.683 --> 00:03:28.393
and how his day was, because sometimes

00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:30.340
all people want to be is human.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.826
I will tell that woman that my students can talk about

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:35.391
transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau,

00:03:35.391 --> 00:03:37.426
and just because you watched
one episode of "The Wire"

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:39.665
doesn't mean you know anything about my kids.

00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:41.338
So this year,

00:03:41.338 --> 00:03:43.485
instead of giving something up,

00:03:43.485 --> 00:03:45.897
I will live every day as if there were a microphone

00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:47.820
tucked under my tongue,

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.825
a stage on the underside of my inhibition.

00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:53.968
Because who has to have a soapbox

00:03:53.968 --> 00:03:58.207
when all you've ever needed is your voice?

00:03:58.207 --> 00:04:00.712
Thank you.

00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:04.712
(Applause)
