WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.976
We're going to go on a dive
to the deep sea,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.976
and anyone that's had
that lovely opportunity

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.681
knows that for about
two and half hours on the way down,

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:12.400
it's a perfectly positively
pitch-black world.

00:00:12.424 --> 00:00:15.416
And we used to see the most mysterious
animals out the window

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.803
that you couldn't describe:

00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:20.426
these blinking lights -- a world
of bioluminescence, like fireflies.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.583
Dr. Edith Widder -- she's now at the Ocean
Research and Conservation Association --

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.366
was able to come up with a camera

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.876
that could capture some
of these incredible animals,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.276
and that's what you're seeing
here on the screen.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.193
That's all bioluminescence.
Like I said: just like fireflies.

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:36.472
There's a flying turkey under a tree.

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:37.506
(Laughter)

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.678
I'm a geologist by training.

00:00:40.702 --> 00:00:42.154
But I love that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.429
And you see, some of the bioluminescence
they use to avoid being eaten,

00:00:46.453 --> 00:00:47.976
some they use to attract prey,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.751
but all of it,
from an artistic point of view,

00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:52.176
is just positively amazing.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.976
And a lot of what goes on inside --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.334
There's a fish with glowing eyes,
pulsating eyes.

00:00:56.358 --> 00:00:58.976
Some of the colors
are designed to hypnotize,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.460
these lovely patterns.

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:02.976
And then this last one,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.976
one of my favorites, this pinwheel design.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.976
Just absolutely amazing,
every single dive.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.063
That's the unknown world,
and today we've only explored

00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:14.813
about 3 percent
of what's out there in the ocean.

00:01:14.837 --> 00:01:17.443
Already we've found
the world's highest mountains,

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:18.976
the world's deepest valleys,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.077
underwater lakes, underwater waterfalls --

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:23.387
a lot of that we shared
with you from the stage.

00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:26.076
And in a place
where we thought no life at all,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.676
we find more life, we think,
and diversity and density

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.183
than the tropical rainforest,

00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:33.232
which tells us that we don't know
much about this planet at all.

00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:34.585
There's still 97 percent,

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.710
and either that 97 percent is empty
or just full of surprises.

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:39.785
But I want to jump up to shallow water now

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:42.495
and look at some creatures
that are positively amazing.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.076
Cephalopods -- head-foots.

00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:47.352
As a kid I knew them as calamari, mostly.

00:01:47.376 --> 00:01:48.453
(Laughter)

00:01:48.477 --> 00:01:49.676
This is an octopus.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.877
This is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon
at the Marine Biological Lab,

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:55.076
and it's just fascinating
how cephalopods can,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.654
with their incredible eyes,
sense their surroundings,

00:01:57.678 --> 00:01:59.454
look at light, look at patterns.

00:01:59.478 --> 00:02:01.976
Here's an octopus moving across the reef,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.801
finds a spot to settle down, curls up
and then disappears into the background.

00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:07.726
Tough thing to do.

00:02:08.892 --> 00:02:11.276
In the next bit, we're going
to see a couple squid.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.973
Now males, when they fight,

00:02:12.997 --> 00:02:15.174
if they're really aggressive,
they turn white.

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:16.776
And these two males are fighting.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.873
They do it by bouncing
their butts together,

00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:20.517
which is an interesting concept.

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:23.276
Now, here's a male on the left
and a female on the right,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.976
and the male has managed
to split his coloration

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.053
so the female only always sees
the kinder, gentler squid in him.

00:02:29.077 --> 00:02:32.976
(Laughter)

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.976
Let's take a look at it again.
Watch the coloration:

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.976
white on the right, brown on the left.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.711
He takes a step back,

00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:44.449
he's keeping off the other
males by splitting his body,

00:02:44.473 --> 00:02:46.176
and comes up on the other side --

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.264
Bingo!

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:50.341
Now, I'm told that's not not just
a squid phenomenon with males,

00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:51.615
but I don't know.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.976
(Laughter)

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.898
Cuttlefish. I love cuttlefish.

00:02:54.922 --> 00:02:56.786
This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.282
And there he is,
his droopy little eyes up here.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.238
But they can do
pretty amazing things, too.

00:03:03.262 --> 00:03:05.976
Here we're going to see
one backing into a crevice,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.976
and watch his tentacles --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.976
he just pulls them in,
makes them look just like algae.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.174
Disappears right into the background.

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:15.667
Positively amazing.

00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:17.091
Here's two males fighting.

00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:19.576
Once again, they're smart enough,
these cephalopods;

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.176
they know not to hurt each other.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.076
But look at the patterns
that they can do with their skin.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.976
That's an amazing thing.

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.796
Here's an octopus.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.252
Sometimes they don't want
to be seen when they move,

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:32.786
because predators can see them.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.886
This guy can make himself
look like a rock,

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.086
and, looking at his environment,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.105
can actually slide across the bottom,

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.106
using the waves and the shadows
so he can't be seen.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.443
His motion blends
right into the background --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.500
the moving rock trick.

00:03:48.798 --> 00:03:51.276
So, we're learning
lots new from the shallow water.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.477
Still exploring the deep,
but learning lots from the shallow water.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:55.764
There's a good reason why:

00:03:55.788 --> 00:03:58.700
the shallow water's full of predators
-- here's a barracuda --

00:03:58.724 --> 00:04:00.776
and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.976
you need to really understand
how to use your surroundings to hide.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.777
In the next scene, you're going to see
a nice coral bottom.

00:04:06.801 --> 00:04:08.841
And you see that an octopus
would stand out

00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:11.448
very easily there if you couldn't
use your camouflage,

00:04:11.472 --> 00:04:13.573
use your skin to change color and texture.

00:04:13.597 --> 00:04:15.976
Here's some algae in the foreground --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.751
and an octopus.

00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:20.175
Ain't that amazing?

00:04:21.847 --> 00:04:25.976
Now, Roger spooked him,
so he took off in a cloud of ink,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.976
and when he lands, the octopus says,
"Oh, I've been seen.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.477
The best thing to do is to get
as big as I can get."

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:33.976
That big brown makes his eyespot very big.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.977
So, he's bluffing.
Let's do it backwards.

00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:38.577
I thought he was joking
when he first showed it to me.

00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:41.262
I thought it was all graphics.
So here it is in reverse.

00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:43.476
Watch the skin color;
watch the skin texture.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.176
Just an amazing animal,
it can change color and texture

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.534
to match the surroundings.

00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:49.976
Watch him blend right into this algae.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.976
One, two, three.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.741
(Applause)

00:04:56.765 --> 00:05:00.741
And now he's gone, and so am I.
Thank you very much.

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:03.765
(Applause)
