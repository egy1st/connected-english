WEBVTT

00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.014
I'm a teacher and a practitioner

00:00:02.014 --> 00:00:04.499
of civics in America.

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:07.571
Now, I will kindly ask those of
you who have just fallen asleep

00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:09.683
to please wake up. (Laughter)

00:00:09.683 --> 00:00:11.974
Why is it that the very word "civics"

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:14.865
has such a soporific, 
even a narcoleptic effect

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:16.171
on us?

00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:20.312
I think it's because the very 
word signifies something

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:23.420
exceedingly virtuous, 
exceedingly important,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.830
and exceedingly boring.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.883
Well, I think it's the responsibility of people like us,

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:30.637
people who show up for gatherings like this

00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:33.384
in person or online, in any way we can,

00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:36.285
to make civics sexy again,

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:39.111
as sexy as it was during the American Revolution,

00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:42.554
as sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement.

00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:45.760
And I believe the way we make civics sexy again

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.110
is to make explicitly about the teaching of power.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.603
The way we do that, I believe,

00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:54.997
is at the level of the city.

00:00:54.997 --> 00:00:56.796
This is what I want to talk about today,

00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:59.108
and I want to start by defining some terms

00:00:59.108 --> 00:01:01.183
and then I want to describe the scale

00:01:01.183 --> 00:01:03.046
of the problem I think we face

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:05.472
and then suggest the ways that I believe cities

00:01:05.472 --> 00:01:07.992
can be the seat of the solution.

00:01:07.992 --> 00:01:11.780
So let me start with some definitions.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.557
By civics, I simply mean the art

00:01:13.557 --> 00:01:16.808
of being a pro-social, problem-solving contributor

00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:18.935
in a self-governing community.

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:21.364
Civics is the art of citizenship,

00:01:21.364 --> 00:01:23.479
what Bill Gates Sr. calls simply

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.571
showing up for life,

00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:27.956
and it encompasses three things:

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:31.500
a foundation of values,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.266
an understanding of the systems
that make the world go round,

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.620
and a set of skills

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.104
that allow you to pursue goals

00:01:39.104 --> 00:01:42.777
and to have others join in that pursuit.

00:01:42.777 --> 00:01:45.036
And that brings me to my definition of power,

00:01:45.036 --> 00:01:47.204
which is simply this:

00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:49.870
the capacity to make others do

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.631
what you would have them do.

00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:55.312
It sounds menacing, doesn't it?

00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:57.653
We don't like to talk about power.

00:01:57.653 --> 00:02:03.347
We find it scary. We find it somehow evil.

00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:05.129
We feel uncomfortable naming it.

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:07.542
In the culture and mythology of democracy,

00:02:07.542 --> 00:02:09.285
power resides with the people.

00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:11.078
Period. End of story.

00:02:11.078 --> 00:02:12.653
Any further inquiry not necessary

00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:14.633
and not really that welcome.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:18.691
Power has a negative moral valence.

00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:21.473
It sounds Machiavellian inherently.

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:24.107
It seems inherently evil.

00:02:24.107 --> 00:02:27.912
But in fact power is no more inherently good or evil

00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:31.030
than fire or physics.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.140
It just is.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.346
And power governs

00:02:34.346 --> 00:02:35.947
how any form of government operates,

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:39.427
whether a democracy or a dictatorship.

00:02:39.427 --> 00:02:42.668
And the problem we face today,
here in America in particular,

00:02:42.668 --> 00:02:44.198
but all around the world,

00:02:44.198 --> 00:02:47.483
is that far too many people 
are profoundly illiterate

00:02:47.483 --> 00:02:49.463
in power —

00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:51.533
what it is, who has it,

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:53.996
how it operates, how it flows,

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:56.516
what part of it is visible, 
what part of it is not,

00:02:56.516 --> 00:03:00.128
why some people have it, 
why that's compounded.

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:03.617
And as a result of this illiteracy,

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.483
those few who do understand

00:03:06.483 --> 00:03:08.973
how power operates in civic life,

00:03:08.973 --> 00:03:10.311
those who understand

00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:12.134
how a bill becomes a law, yes,

00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:16.289
but also how a friendship 
becomes a subsidy,

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.694
or how a bias becomes a policy,

00:03:19.694 --> 00:03:22.629
or how a slogan becomes a movement,

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.609
the people who understand those things

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.180
wield disproportionate influence,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.660
and they're perfectly happy

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.740
to fill the vacuum created by the ignorance

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.287
of the great majority.

00:03:35.124 --> 00:03:38.543
This is why it is so fundamental for us right now

00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:42.999
to grab hold of this idea of power

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.755
and to democratize it.

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:49.299
One of the things that is so profoundly exciting

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.282
and challenging about this moment

00:03:51.282 --> 00:03:54.484
is that as a result of this power illiteracy

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:57.151
that is so pervasive,

00:03:57.151 --> 00:04:00.240
there is a concentration

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.491
of knowledge, of understanding, of clout.

00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:06.578
I mean, think about it:

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:09.993
How does a friendship become a subsidy?

00:04:09.993 --> 00:04:11.270
Seamlessly,

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.905
when a senior government official decides

00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:16.402
to leave government and become a lobbyist

00:04:16.402 --> 00:04:18.316
for a private interest

00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:21.018
and convert his or her relationships into capital

00:04:21.018 --> 00:04:23.325
for their new masters.

00:04:23.325 --> 00:04:25.750
How does a bias become a policy?

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.350
Insidiously, just the way that

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.510
stop-and-frisk, for instance,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.166
became over time a bureaucratic numbers game.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:38.271
How does a slogan become a movement?

00:04:38.271 --> 00:04:41.252
Virally, in the way that the Tea Party, for instance,

00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:44.718
was able to take the "Don't Tread on Me" flag

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:46.465
from the American Revolution,

00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:48.315
or how, on the other side,

00:04:48.315 --> 00:04:51.279
a band of activists could take a magazine headline,

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:53.216
"Occupy Wall Street,"

00:04:53.216 --> 00:04:56.132
and turn that into a global meme and movement.

00:04:56.132 --> 00:04:58.638
The thing is, though, most people

00:04:58.638 --> 00:05:01.890
aren't looking for and don't
want to see these realities.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.325
So much of this ignorance, this civic illiteracy,

00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:07.122
is willful.

00:05:07.122 --> 00:05:08.970
There are some millennials, for instance,

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.636
who think the whole business is just sordid.

00:05:11.636 --> 00:05:13.312
They don't want to have anything to do with politics.

00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:14.391
They'd rather just opt out

00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:17.179
and engage in volunteerism.

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:19.372
There are some techies out there

00:05:19.372 --> 00:05:20.668
who believe that the cure-all

00:05:20.668 --> 00:05:23.216
for any power imbalance or power abuse

00:05:23.216 --> 00:05:25.610
is simply more data,

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.093
more transparency.

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:30.308
There are some on the left who think power resides

00:05:30.308 --> 00:05:32.167
only with corporations,

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:34.090
and some on the right who think power

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.603
resides only with government,

00:05:35.603 --> 00:05:39.964
each side blinded by their selective outrage.

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:42.008
There are the naive who believe that

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.315
good things just happen

00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:46.665
and the cynical who believe
that bad things just happen,

00:05:46.665 --> 00:05:49.017
the fortunate and unfortunate alike

00:05:49.017 --> 00:05:52.540
who think that their lot is simply what they deserve

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.501
rather than the eminently alterable result

00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:59.783
of a prior arrangement, an inherited allocation,

00:05:59.783 --> 00:06:03.446
of power.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:07.122
As a result of all of this
creeping fatalism in public life,

00:06:07.122 --> 00:06:09.259
we here, particularly in America today,

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.141
have depressingly low levels

00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:14.199
of civic knowledge, civic engagement, participation,

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.380
awareness.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.258
The whole business of politics has been

00:06:19.258 --> 00:06:22.950
effectively subcontracted out
to a band of professionals,

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.761
money people, outreach people,

00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:26.851
message people, research people.

00:06:26.851 --> 00:06:29.922
The rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:32.088
in the sense of suckers.

00:06:32.088 --> 00:06:34.614
We become demotivated to learn more

00:06:34.614 --> 00:06:35.996
about how things work.

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:38.251
We begin to opt out.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.221
Well, this problem, this challenge,

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:47.910
is a thing that we must now confront,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.901
and I believe that when you have

00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:51.880
this kind of disengagement, this willful ignorance,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.359
it becomes both a cause and a consequence

00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:58.235
of this concentration of opportunity

00:06:58.235 --> 00:07:00.596
of wealth and clout that I was
describing a moment ago,

00:07:00.596 --> 00:07:04.334
this profound civic inequality.

00:07:04.334 --> 00:07:07.475
This is why it is so important in our time right now

00:07:07.475 --> 00:07:10.922
to reimagine civics as the teaching of power.

00:07:10.922 --> 00:07:13.566
Perhaps it's never been more important

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:18.955
at any time in our lifetimes.

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:20.890
If people don't learn power,

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.458
people don't wake up,

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:24.213
and if they don't wake up,

00:07:24.213 --> 00:07:26.980
they get left out.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.452
Now, part of the art of practicing power

00:07:31.452 --> 00:07:33.512
means being awake and having a voice,

00:07:33.512 --> 00:07:35.897
but it also is about having an arena

00:07:35.897 --> 00:07:39.959
where you can plausibly practice deciding.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.141
All of civics boils down to the simple question

00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:43.899
of who decides,

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:45.661
and you have to play that out

00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:47.694
in a place, in an arena.

00:07:47.694 --> 00:07:50.622
And this brings me to the third
point that I want to make today,

00:07:50.622 --> 00:07:54.233
which is simply that there is no better arena

00:07:54.233 --> 00:07:57.282
in our time for the practicing of power

00:07:57.282 --> 00:08:00.174
than the city.

00:08:00.174 --> 00:08:02.028
Think about the city where you live,

00:08:02.028 --> 00:08:03.885
where you're from.

00:08:03.885 --> 00:08:07.136
Think about a problem in
the common life of your city.

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:08.169
It can be something small,

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:10.676
like where a street lamp should go,

00:08:10.676 --> 00:08:12.297
or something medium like

00:08:12.297 --> 00:08:16.234
which library should have its hours extended or cut,

00:08:16.234 --> 00:08:17.804
or maybe something bigger,

00:08:17.804 --> 00:08:20.502
like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be

00:08:20.502 --> 00:08:23.437
turned into a highway or a greenway,

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:25.135
or whether all the businesses in your town

00:08:25.135 --> 00:08:29.185
should be required to pay a living wage.

00:08:29.185 --> 00:08:31.536
Think about the change that you want in your city,

00:08:31.536 --> 00:08:35.248
and then think about how you would get it,

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:38.880
how you would make it happen.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.210
Take an inventory of all the forms of power

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.354
that are at play in your city's situation:

00:08:44.354 --> 00:08:48.693
money, of course, people, yes,

00:08:48.693 --> 00:08:53.603
ideas, information, misinformation,

00:08:53.603 --> 00:08:57.227
the threat of force, the force of norms.

00:08:57.227 --> 00:08:59.138
All of these form of power are at play.

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:00.680
Now think about how you would activate

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.483
or perhaps neutralize these various forms of power.

00:09:05.483 --> 00:09:08.689
This is not some Game of Thrones

00:09:08.689 --> 00:09:11.025
empire-level set of questions.

00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:12.918
These are questions that play out

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:15.664
in every single place on the planet.

00:09:15.664 --> 00:09:17.823
I'll just tell you quickly about two stories

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.859
drawn from recent headlines.

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:21.301
In Boulder, Colorado,

00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:25.290
voters not too long ago approved a process

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.182
to replace the private power company,

00:09:28.182 --> 00:09:30.494
literally the power company,
the electric company Xcel,

00:09:30.494 --> 00:09:32.790
with a publicly owned utility

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.136
that would forego profits

00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:37.845
and attend far more to climate change.

00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:39.970
Well, Xcel fought back,

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.330
and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.226
that would undermine or undo

00:09:44.226 --> 00:09:46.022
this municipalization.

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:48.636
And so the citizen activists in
Boulder who have been pushing this

00:09:48.636 --> 00:09:51.370
now literally have to fight the power

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.969
in order to fight for power.

00:09:53.969 --> 00:09:58.342
In Tuscaloosa, at the University of Alabama,

00:09:58.342 --> 00:10:00.278
there's an organization on campus

00:10:00.278 --> 00:10:04.151
called, kind of menacingly, the Machine,

00:10:04.151 --> 00:10:07.522
and it draws from largely white sororities

00:10:07.522 --> 00:10:08.962
and fraternities on campus,

00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:11.381
and for decades, the Machine has dominated

00:10:11.381 --> 00:10:13.234
student government elections.

00:10:13.234 --> 00:10:15.630
Well now, recently, the Machine

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.927
has started to get involved

00:10:16.927 --> 00:10:18.610
in actual city politics,

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.268
and they've engineered the election

00:10:20.268 --> 00:10:21.640
of a former Machine member,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.346
a young, pro-business recent graduate

00:10:24.346 --> 00:10:27.860
to the Tuscaloosa city school board.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.696
Now, as I say, these are just two examples

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:33.400
drawn almost at random from the headlines.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.600
Every day, there are thousands more like them.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.364
And you may like or dislike

00:10:38.364 --> 00:10:40.269
the efforts I'm describing here

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:41.598
in Boulder or in Tuscaloosa,

00:10:41.598 --> 00:10:44.240
but you cannot help but admire

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.311
the power literacy of the players involved,

00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:48.486
their skill.

00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:51.462
You cannot help but reckon with and recognize

00:10:51.462 --> 00:10:53.073
the command they have

00:10:53.073 --> 00:10:55.608
of the elemental questions

00:10:55.608 --> 00:10:57.484
of civic power —

00:10:57.484 --> 00:11:01.522
what objective, what strategy, what tactics,

00:11:01.522 --> 00:11:04.500
what is the terrain, who are your enemies,

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.650
who are your allies?

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.395
Now I want you to return

00:11:08.395 --> 00:11:11.790
to thinking about that problem or that opportunity

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.951
or that challenge in your city,

00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:15.824
and the thing it was that you want to fix

00:11:15.824 --> 00:11:17.635
or create in your city,

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.950
and ask yourself,

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.600
do you have command of these
elemental questions of power?

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.650
Could you put into practice effectively

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.664
what it is that you know?

00:11:29.664 --> 00:11:34.061
This is the challenge and the opportunity for us.

00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:36.577
We live in a time right now

00:11:36.577 --> 00:11:39.564
where in spite of globalization

00:11:39.564 --> 00:11:41.724
or perhaps because of globalization,

00:11:41.724 --> 00:11:43.760
all citizenship is ever more resonantly,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.540
powerfully local.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.248
Indeed, power in our time is flowing

00:11:48.248 --> 00:11:50.610
ever faster to the city.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.258
Here in the United States, the national government

00:11:52.258 --> 00:11:55.259
has tied itself up in partisan knots.

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:58.181
Civic imagination and innovation and creativity

00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:00.798
are emerging from local ecosystems now

00:12:00.798 --> 00:12:02.688
and radiating outward,

00:12:02.688 --> 00:12:06.128
and this great innovation,

00:12:06.128 --> 00:12:09.055
this great wave

00:12:09.055 --> 00:12:12.981
of localism that's now arriving,

00:12:12.981 --> 00:12:14.646
and you see it in how people eat

00:12:14.646 --> 00:12:17.294
and work and share and buy and move

00:12:17.294 --> 00:12:18.989
and live their everyday lives,

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:22.142
this isn't some precious parochialism,

00:12:22.142 --> 00:12:25.456
this isn't some retreat into insularity, no.

00:12:25.456 --> 00:12:27.819
This is emergent.

00:12:27.819 --> 00:12:31.610
The localism of our time is networked powerfully.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:32.873
And so, for instance,

00:12:32.873 --> 00:12:35.036
consider the ways that strategies

00:12:35.036 --> 00:12:37.470
for making cities more bike-friendly

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.016
have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen

00:12:40.016 --> 00:12:45.138
to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle.

00:12:45.138 --> 00:12:48.702
Think about how experiments
in participatory budgeting,

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:50.175
where everyday citizens get a chance

00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:52.976
to allocate and decide upon

00:12:52.976 --> 00:12:55.910
the allocation of city funds.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.490
Those experiments have
spread from Porto Alegre, Brazil

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.840
to here in New York City, 
to the wards of Chicago.

00:13:03.853 --> 00:13:05.991
Migrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles

00:13:05.991 --> 00:13:08.341
and many cities between

00:13:08.341 --> 00:13:10.624
are now organizing to stage strikes

00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:12.694
to remind the people who live in their cities

00:13:12.694 --> 00:13:15.980
what a day without immigrants would look like.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.438
In China, all across that country,

00:13:18.438 --> 00:13:20.646
members of the New Citizens' Movement

00:13:20.646 --> 00:13:22.232
are beginning to activate and organize

00:13:22.232 --> 00:13:24.886
to fight official corruption and graft,

00:13:24.886 --> 00:13:26.990
and they're drawing the ire of officials there,

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.733
but they're also drawing the attention

00:13:28.733 --> 00:13:32.288
of anti-corruption activists all around the world.

00:13:32.288 --> 00:13:34.223
In Seattle, where I'm from,

00:13:34.223 --> 00:13:36.669
we've become part of a great global array of cities

00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:38.228
that are now working together

00:13:38.228 --> 00:13:39.758
bypassing government altogether,

00:13:39.758 --> 00:13:42.138
national government altogether,

00:13:42.138 --> 00:13:44.487
in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals

00:13:44.487 --> 00:13:46.627
of the Kyoto Protocol.

00:13:46.627 --> 00:13:49.670
All of these citizens, united,

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.345
are forming a web,

00:13:51.345 --> 00:13:53.358
a great archipelago of power

00:13:53.358 --> 00:13:55.765
that allows us to bypass

00:13:55.765 --> 00:13:59.669
brokenness and monopolies of control.

00:13:59.669 --> 00:14:02.550
And our task now is to accelerate this work.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.664
Our task now is to bring more and more people

00:14:04.664 --> 00:14:06.695
into the fold of this work.

00:14:06.695 --> 00:14:09.444
That's why my organization, Citizen University,

00:14:09.444 --> 00:14:11.448
has undertaken a project now

00:14:11.448 --> 00:14:14.293
to create an everyman's curriculum

00:14:14.293 --> 00:14:16.610
in civic power.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.815
And this curriculum starts with this triad

00:14:18.815 --> 00:14:20.830
that I described earlier of values,

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.956
systems and skills.

00:14:23.956 --> 00:14:26.808
And what I'd like to do is to invite all of you

00:14:26.808 --> 00:14:29.458
to help create this curriculum

00:14:29.458 --> 00:14:31.885
with the stories and the experiences

00:14:31.885 --> 00:14:35.142
and the challenges that each of you lives and faces,

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:38.146
to create something powerfully collective.

00:14:38.146 --> 00:14:40.557
And I want to invite you in particular to try

00:14:40.557 --> 00:14:42.656
a simple exercise drawn

00:14:42.656 --> 00:14:45.199
from the early frameworks of this curriculum.

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:47.630
I want you to write a narrative,

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.680
a narrative from the future of your city,

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.221
and you can date it, set it out one year from now,

00:14:54.221 --> 00:14:55.965
five years from now, a decade from now,

00:14:55.965 --> 00:14:57.766
a generation from now,

00:14:57.766 --> 00:15:01.611
and write it as a case study looking back,

00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:03.256
looking back at the change

00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:05.352
that you wanted in your city,

00:15:05.352 --> 00:15:08.091
looking back at the cause
that you were championing,

00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:10.825
and describing the ways that that change

00:15:10.825 --> 00:15:15.036
and that cause came, in fact, to succeed.

00:15:15.036 --> 00:15:16.948
Describe the values

00:15:16.948 --> 00:15:19.333
of your fellow citizens that you activated,

00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:22.940
and the sense of moral purpose
that you were able to stir.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.602
Recount all the different ways

00:15:24.602 --> 00:15:27.230
that you engaged the systems of government,

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.741
of the marketplace,

00:15:28.741 --> 00:15:30.946
of social institutions, of faith organizations,

00:15:30.946 --> 00:15:34.148
of the media.

00:15:34.148 --> 00:15:38.113
Catalog all the skills you had to deploy,

00:15:38.113 --> 00:15:40.527
how to negotiate, how to advocate,

00:15:40.527 --> 00:15:41.922
how to frame issues,

00:15:41.922 --> 00:15:44.463
how to navigate diversity in conflict,

00:15:44.463 --> 00:15:46.282
all those skills that enabled you

00:15:46.282 --> 00:15:48.353
to bring folks on board

00:15:48.353 --> 00:15:51.050
and to overcome resistance.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.422
What you'll be doing when you write that narrative

00:15:54.422 --> 00:15:58.501
is you'll be discovering how to read power,

00:15:58.501 --> 00:16:03.698
and in the process, how to write power.

00:16:03.698 --> 00:16:05.903
So share what you write,

00:16:05.903 --> 00:16:07.241
do you what you write,

00:16:07.241 --> 00:16:11.058
and then share what you do.

00:16:11.058 --> 00:16:13.052
I invite you to literally share

00:16:13.052 --> 00:16:14.946
the narratives that you create

00:16:14.946 --> 00:16:17.890
on our Facebook page for Citizen University.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.572
But even beyond that, it's in the conversations

00:16:20.572 --> 00:16:22.128
that we have today

00:16:22.128 --> 00:16:24.389
all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings

00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:27.239
that are happening on this topic at this moment,

00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:28.990
and to think about how we can become

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.590
one another's teachers and students in power.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.863
If we do that, then together

00:16:34.863 --> 00:16:37.276
we can make civics sexy again.

00:16:37.276 --> 00:16:39.678
Together, we can democratize democracy

00:16:39.678 --> 00:16:42.888
and make it safe again for amateurs.

00:16:42.888 --> 00:16:47.237
Together, we can create a great network of city

00:16:47.237 --> 00:16:49.769
that will be the most powerful collective laboratory

00:16:49.769 --> 00:16:53.235
for self-government this planet has ever seen.

00:16:53.235 --> 00:16:56.221
We have the power to do that.

00:16:56.221 --> 00:16:58.690
Thank you very much.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.933
(Applause)
