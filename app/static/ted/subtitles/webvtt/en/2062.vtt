00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.570
When my first children's book was published

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.293
in 2001,

00:00:04.293 --> 00:00:06.506
I returned to my old elementary school

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.446
to talk to the students about being an author

00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:10.162
and an illustrator,

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:12.895
and when I was setting up my slide projector

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:16.100
in the cafetorium,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.148
I looked across the room,

00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:20.759
and there she was:

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.603
my old lunch lady.

00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:24.570
She was still there at the school

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.456
and she was busily preparing lunches for the day.

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:29.100
So I approached her to say hello,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.987
and I said, "Hi, Jeannie! How are you?"

00:00:30.987 --> 00:00:32.557
And she looked at me, and I could tell

00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:34.284
that she recognized me,

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.369
but she couldn't quite place me,
and she looked at me and she said,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.130
"Stephen Krosoczka?"

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.272
And I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka,

00:00:42.272 --> 00:00:45.703
but Stephen is my uncle who
is 20 years older than I am,

00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:48.840
and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.345
And she started telling me about her grandkids,

00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:54.050
and that blew my mind.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.844
My lunch lady had grandkids,

00:00:55.844 --> 00:00:56.808
and therefore kids,

00:00:56.808 --> 00:01:00.063
and therefore left school at the end of the day?

00:01:00.063 --> 00:01:01.806
I thought she lived in the cafeteria

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:02.679
with the serving spoons.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.622
I had never thought about any of that before.

00:01:04.622 --> 00:01:08.354
Well, that chance encounter inspired my imagination,

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:11.905
and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series,

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.082
a series of comics about a lunch lady

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:16.680
who uses her fish stick nunchucks

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.582
to fight off evil cyborg substitutes,

00:01:19.582 --> 00:01:22.889
a school bus monster, and mutant mathletes,

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:24.356
and the end of every book,

00:01:24.356 --> 00:01:25.862
they get the bad guy with their hairnet,

00:01:25.862 --> 00:01:29.616
and they proclaim, "Justice is served!"

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:33.869
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.476
And it's been amazing, because the series

00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:39.369
was so welcomed into the reading lives of children,

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.608
and they sent me the most amazing letters

00:01:41.608 --> 00:01:43.765
and cards and artwork.

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:46.239
And I would notice as I would visit schools,

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.793
the lunch staff would be involved in the programming

00:01:48.793 --> 00:01:50.939
in a very meaningful way.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.685
And coast to coast,

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:54.780
all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing:

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.675
"Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness."

00:01:58.675 --> 00:02:01.444
Because the lunch lady has not been treated

00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:04.966
very kindly in popular culture over time.

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:07.138
But it meant the most to Jeannie.

00:02:07.138 --> 00:02:08.828
When the books were first published,

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:10.932
I invited her to the book launch party,

00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:12.743
and in front of everyone there,

00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:14.040
everyone she had fed over the years,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.980
I gave her a piece of artwork and some books.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.549
And two years after this photo was taken,

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.360
she passed away,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.447
and I attended her wake,

00:02:22.447 --> 00:02:25.286
and nothing could have prepared
me for what I saw there,

00:02:25.286 --> 00:02:28.774
because next to her casket was this painting,

00:02:28.774 --> 00:02:32.340
and her husband told me it meant so much to her

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.758
that I had acknowledged her hard work,

00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:37.624
I had validated what she did.

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.516
And that inspired me to create a day

00:02:39.516 --> 00:02:41.766
where we could recreate that feeling

00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:44.781
in cafeterias across the country:

00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:46.434
School Lunch Hero Day, a day where kids

00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:49.292
can make creative projects for their lunch staff.

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:51.496
And I partnered with the
School Nutrition Association,

00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:54.624
and did you know that a little over 30 million kids

00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:56.446
participate in school lunch programs every day.

00:02:56.446 --> 00:02:59.798
That equals up to a little over five billion lunches

00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:01.305
made every school year.

00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:03.691
And the stories of heroism go well beyond

00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:05.678
just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets

00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:06.843
on their lunch tray.

00:03:06.843 --> 00:03:08.552
There is Ms. Brenda in California,

00:03:08.552 --> 00:03:11.341
who keeps a close eye on every
student that comes through her line

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:13.826
and then reports back to the guidance counselor

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.176
if anything is amiss.

00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:16.600
There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.235
who realized that 67 percent of their students

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:21.208
relied on those meals every day,

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.324
and they were going without food over the summer,

00:03:23.324 --> 00:03:25.348
so they retrofitted a school bus

00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:27.100
to create a mobile feeding unit,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.335
and they traveled around the neighborhoods

00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:31.134
feedings 500 kids a day during the summer.

00:03:31.134 --> 00:03:33.729
And kids made the most amazing projects.

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:34.779
I knew they would.

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:36.391
Kids made hamburger cards

00:03:36.391 --> 00:03:38.385
that were made out of construction paper.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.286
They took photos of their lunch lady's head

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:42.094
and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady

00:03:42.094 --> 00:03:43.887
and fixed that to a milk carton

00:03:43.887 --> 00:03:46.373
and presented them with flowers.

00:03:46.373 --> 00:03:48.376
And they made their own comics,

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:49.737
starring the cartoon lunch lady

00:03:49.737 --> 00:03:51.960
alongside their actual lunch ladies.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.896
And they made thank you pizzas,

00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:55.811
where every kid signed a different topping

00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.770
of a construction paper pizza.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.370
For me, I was so moved by the response

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.349
that came from the lunch ladies,

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.228
because one woman said to me, she said,

00:04:06.228 --> 00:04:08.763
"Before this day, I felt like I was

00:04:08.763 --> 00:04:11.200
at the end of the planet at this school.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.575
I didn't think that anyone noticed us down here."

00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:15.442
Another woman said to me,

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:17.990
"You know, what I got out of this

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.944
is that what I do is important."

00:04:20.944 --> 00:04:23.284
And of course what she does is important.

00:04:23.284 --> 00:04:25.388
What they all do is important.

00:04:25.388 --> 00:04:28.777
They're feeding our children every single day,

00:04:28.777 --> 00:04:31.236
and before a child can learn,

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:33.766
their belly needs to be full,

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:35.544
and these women and men

00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:37.467
are working on the front lines to create

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:39.670
an educated society.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.440
So I hope that

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.341
you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day

00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:46.376
to say thank you to your lunch staff,

00:04:46.376 --> 00:04:48.424
and I hope that you remember

00:04:48.424 --> 00:04:51.270
how powerful a thank you can be.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.265
A thank you can change a life.

00:04:53.265 --> 00:04:56.467
It changes the life of the person who receives it,

00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:58.751
and it changes the life of the person

00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:00.377
who expresses it.

00:05:00.377 --> 00:05:02.733
Thank you.

00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:06.733
(Applause)
