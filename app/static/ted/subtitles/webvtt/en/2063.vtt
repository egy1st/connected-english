00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.385
These are simple objects:

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:06.180
clocks, keys, combs, glasses.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.520
They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.517
carried with them on their final journey.

00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:14.240
We are all familiar with these mundane,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.974
everyday objects.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.559
The fact that some of the victims carried

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.973
personal items such as
toothpaste and a toothbrush

00:00:20.973 --> 00:00:23.492
is a clear sign they had no idea

00:00:23.492 --> 00:00:25.320
what was about to happen to them.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.711
Usually, they were told that they were going to be

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:30.199
exchanged for prisoners of war.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.212
These items have been recovered

00:00:32.212 --> 00:00:35.050
from numerous mass graves across my homeland,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.580
and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.714
from newly discovered mass graves,

00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:41.250
20 years after the war.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.333
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.611
During the four years of conflict

00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:50.457
that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s,

00:00:50.457 --> 00:00:53.888
approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians,

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:55.823
went missing, presumed killed,

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:57.803
and another 100,000 were killed

00:00:57.803 --> 00:00:59.530
during combat operations.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.159
Most of them were killed

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:02.932
either in the early days of the war

00:01:02.932 --> 00:01:04.298
or towards the end of the hostilities,

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:07.477
when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica

00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:10.522
fell into the hands of the Serb army.

00:01:10.522 --> 00:01:12.640
The international criminal tribunal

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.330
delivered a number of sentences

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.109
for crimes against humanity and genocide.

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:20.618
Genocide is a systematic and deliberate

00:01:20.618 --> 00:01:24.288
destruction of a racial, political, religious

00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:25.960
or ethnic group.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.540
As much as genocide is about killing.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.561
It is also about destroying their property,

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:33.451
their cultural heritage,

00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:36.713
and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed.

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:39.210
Genocide is not only about the killing;

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.383
it is about the denied identity.

00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:43.813
There are always traces â€”

00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:45.532
no such thing as a perfect crime.

00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:48.267
There are always remnants of the perished ones

00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:50.785
that are more durable than their fragile bodies

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:54.523
and our selective and fading memory of them.

00:01:54.523 --> 00:01:57.180
These items are recovered

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.352
from numerous mass graves,

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:01.766
and the main goal of this collection of the items

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:03.234
is a unique process

00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:06.512
of identifying those who disappeared in the killings,

00:02:06.512 --> 00:02:09.482
the first act of genocide on European soil

00:02:09.482 --> 00:02:10.905
since the Holocaust.

00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:13.419
Not a single body should remain undiscovered

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:15.285
or unidentified.

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:16.650
Once recovered,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.573
these items that the victims carried with them

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:21.052
on their way to execution

00:02:21.052 --> 00:02:23.409
are carefully cleaned, analyzed,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.647
catalogued and stored.

00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:28.797
Thousands of artifacts are
packed in white plastic bags

00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:31.200
just like the ones you see on CSI.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.938
These objects are used as a forensic tool

00:02:33.938 --> 00:02:36.393
in visual identification of the victims,

00:02:36.393 --> 00:02:39.640
but they are also used as
very valuable forensic evidence

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.477
in the ongoing war crimes trials.

00:02:42.477 --> 00:02:44.568
Survivors are occasionally called

00:02:44.568 --> 00:02:47.119
to try to identify these items physically,

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.449
but physical browsing is extremely difficult,

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.551
an ineffective and painful process.

00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:57.344
Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:58.486
are done with these objects,

00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:01.417
they become orphans of the narrative.

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:04.319
Many of them get destroyed, believe it or not,

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.956
or they get simply shelved,

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:08.198
out of sight and out of mind.

00:03:08.198 --> 00:03:10.714
I decided a few years ago

00:03:10.714 --> 00:03:13.380
to photograph every single exhumed item

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.281
in order to create a visual archive

00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:18.631
that survivors could easily browse.

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:22.688
As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community.

00:03:22.688 --> 00:03:25.431
I like to move beyond raising awareness.

00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:27.615
And in this case, someone may

00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:29.216
recognize these items

00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:31.912
or at least their photographs will remain

00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:35.714
as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:37.626
of what happened.

00:03:37.626 --> 00:03:39.764
Photography is about empathy,

00:03:39.764 --> 00:03:42.982
and the familiarity of these
items guarantee empathy.

00:03:42.982 --> 00:03:45.436
In this case, I am merely a tool,

00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:47.090
a forensic, if you like,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.755
and the result is a photography that is as close

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:52.376
as possible of being a document.

00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:55.515
Once all the missing persons are identified,

00:03:55.515 --> 00:03:57.288
only decaying bodies in their graves

00:03:57.288 --> 00:03:59.630
and these everyday items will remain.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.555
In all their simplicity,

00:04:01.555 --> 00:04:03.762
these items are the last testament

00:04:03.762 --> 00:04:05.319
to the identity of the victims,

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.347
the last permanent reminder

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.319
that these people ever existed.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.657
Thank you very much.

00:04:11.657 --> 00:04:15.470
(Applause)
