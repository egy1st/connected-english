00:00:00.465 --> 00:00:03.722
In Kenya, 1984 is known

00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:06.333
as the year of the cup,

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.753
or the goro goro.

00:00:08.753 --> 00:00:11.671
The goro goro is a cup used to measure

00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:14.981
two kilograms of maize flower on the market,

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:18.121
and the maize flower is used to make ugali,

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:22.078
a polenta-like cake that is eaten
together with vegetables.

00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:24.393
Both the maize and the vegetables are grown

00:00:24.393 --> 00:00:26.518
on most Kenyan farms,

00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:28.791
which means that most families can feed themselves

00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:30.972
from their own farm.

00:00:30.972 --> 00:00:34.900
One goro goro can feed three meals

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.881
for an average family,

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:39.970
and in 1984, the whole harvest

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.142
could fit in one goro goro.

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:45.992
It was and still is one of the worst droughts

00:00:45.992 --> 00:00:48.635
in living memory.

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:51.594
Now today, I insure farmers against droughts

00:00:51.594 --> 00:00:53.655
like those in the year of the cup,

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:58.641
or to be more specific, I insure the rains.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.090
I come from a family of missionaries

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.241
who built hospitals in Indonesia,

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:05.518
and my father built a psychiatric hospital

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:06.774
in Tanzania.

00:01:06.774 --> 00:01:09.875
This is me, age five, in front of that hospital.

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:12.196
I don't think they thought I'd grow up

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:15.162
to sell insurance. (Laughter)

00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:18.203
So let me tell you how that happened.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.920
In 2008, I was working

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.204
for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda,

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:24.200
and my boss had just been promoted

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.607
to become the minister.

00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:27.495
She launched an ambitious plan

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:29.824
to start a green revolution in her country,

00:01:29.824 --> 00:01:31.444
and before we knew it, we were importing

00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:33.737
tons of fertilizer and seed

00:01:33.737 --> 00:01:36.462
and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:37.997
and plant.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.890
A couple of weeks later,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.603
the International Monetary Fund visited us,

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:44.133
and asked my minister,

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.945
"Minister, it's great that you want to help farmers

00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:51.118
reach food security, but what if it doesn't rain?"

00:01:51.118 --> 00:01:53.267
My minister answered proudly

00:01:53.267 --> 00:01:55.281
and somewhat defiantly,

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:59.871
"I am going to pray for rain."

00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:03.071
That ended the discussion.

00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:05.225
On the way back to the ministry in the car,

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.306
she turned around to me and said,

00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:09.376
"Rose, you've always been interested in finance.

00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:12.515
Go find us some insurance."

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:14.552
It's been six years since,

00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:16.542
and last year I was fortunate enough

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:18.048
to be part of a team that insured

00:02:18.048 --> 00:02:21.953
over 185,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda

00:02:21.953 --> 00:02:23.890
against drought.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.970
They owned an average of half an acre

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.423
and paid on average two Euros in premium.

00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:31.800
It's microinsurance.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.855
Now, traditional insurance doesn't work

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:35.768
with two to three Euros of premium,

00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:38.675
because traditional insurance relies on farm visits.

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:40.617
A farmer here in Germany would be visited

00:02:40.617 --> 00:02:43.102
for the start of the season, halfway through,

00:02:43.102 --> 00:02:45.589
and at the end, and again if there was a loss,

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.995
to estimate the damages.

00:02:48.995 --> 00:02:52.130
For a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.959
the maths of doing those visits

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.030
simply don't add up.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.871
So instead, we rely on technology and data.

00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:03.077
This satellite measures

00:03:03.077 --> 00:03:05.239
whether there were clouds or not,

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.407
because think about it:

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:11.109
If there are clouds, then you might have some rain,

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.808
but if there are no clouds,

00:03:12.808 --> 00:03:15.659
then it's actually impossible for it to rain.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.939
These images show the onset of the rains

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.794
this season in Kenya.

00:03:19.794 --> 00:03:21.830
You see that around March 6,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.935
the clouds move in and then disappear,

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:26.963
and then around the March 11,

00:03:26.963 --> 00:03:30.213
the clouds really move in.

00:03:30.213 --> 00:03:33.140
That, and those clouds,

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.028
were the onset of the rains this year.

00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:38.715
This satellite covers the whole of Africa

00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:41.632
and goes back as far as 1984,

00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:43.980
and that's important, because if you know

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.421
how many times a place has had a drought

00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:48.370
in the last 30 years,

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.200
you can make a pretty good estimate

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.957
what the chances are of drought in the future,

00:03:52.957 --> 00:03:55.070
and that means that you can put a price tag

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.760
on the risk of drought.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.156
The data alone isn't enough.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.641
We devise agronomic algorithms

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:06.335
which tell us how much rainfall
a crop needs and when.

00:04:06.335 --> 00:04:08.749
For example, for maize at planting,

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.144
you need to have two days of rain

00:04:11.144 --> 00:04:13.000
for farmers to plant,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.194
and then it needs to rain once every two weeks

00:04:15.194 --> 00:04:17.673
for the crop to properly germinate.

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:20.998
After that, you need rain every three weeks

00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:23.901
for the crop to form its leaves,

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:26.667
whereas at flowering, you
need it to rain more frequently,

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:30.527
about once every 10 days
for the crop to form its cob.

00:04:30.527 --> 00:04:32.032
At the end of the season,

00:04:32.032 --> 00:04:34.244
you actually don't want it to rain,

00:04:34.244 --> 00:04:37.795
because rains then can damage the crop.

00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:41.150
Devising such a cover is difficult,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.046
but it turned out the real challenge

00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:47.574
was selling insurance.

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:50.061
We set ourselves a modest target

00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:54.061
of 500 farmers insured after our first season.

00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:56.631
After a couple of months' intense marketing,

00:04:56.631 --> 00:04:58.450
we had signed up the grand total

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.108
of 185 farmers.

00:05:02.108 --> 00:05:05.030
I was disappointed and confounded.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.684
Everybody kept telling me that farmers

00:05:06.684 --> 00:05:09.267
wanted insurance,

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:12.264
but our prime customers simply weren't buying.

00:05:12.264 --> 00:05:14.928
They were waiting to see what would happen,

00:05:14.928 --> 00:05:17.677
didn't trust insurance companies,

00:05:17.677 --> 00:05:19.963
or thought, "I've managed for so many years.

00:05:19.963 --> 00:05:23.720
Why would I buy insurance now?"

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.102
Now many of you know microcredit,

00:05:26.102 --> 00:05:29.596
the method of providing small loans to poor people

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.598
pioneered by Muhammad Yunus,

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:33.119
who won the Nobel Peace Prize

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:35.268
for his work with the Grameen Bank.

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:37.752
Turns out, selling microcredit

00:05:37.752 --> 00:05:41.153
isn't the same as selling insurance.

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:45.038
For credit, a farmer needs
to earn the trust of a bank,

00:05:45.038 --> 00:05:48.982
and if it succeeds, the bank will advance him money.

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.091
That's an attractive proposition.

00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:54.337
For insurance, the farmer needs to trust

00:05:54.337 --> 00:05:55.879
the insurance company, and needs

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.103
to advance the insurance company money.

00:05:59.103 --> 00:06:02.470
It's a very different value proposition.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.159
And so the uptick of insurance has been slow,

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.735
with so far only 4.4 percent of Africans

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:10.288
taking up insurance in 2012,

00:06:10.288 --> 00:06:12.280
and half of that number is in one country,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.323
South Africa.

00:06:14.323 --> 00:06:15.970
We tried for some years

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.421
selling insurance directly to farmers,

00:06:18.421 --> 00:06:20.420
with very high marketing cost

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.506
and very limited success.

00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:25.460
Then we realized that there were many organizations

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.169
working with farmers:

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.606
seed companies, microfinance institutions,

00:06:31.606 --> 00:06:33.552
mobile phone companies,

00:06:33.552 --> 00:06:34.874
government agencies.

00:06:34.874 --> 00:06:37.624
They were all providing loans to farmers,

00:06:37.624 --> 00:06:40.246
and often, just before they'd finalize the loan,

00:06:40.246 --> 00:06:42.346
the farmer would say,

00:06:42.346 --> 00:06:44.498
"But what if it doesn't rain?

00:06:44.498 --> 00:06:47.965
How do you expect me to repay my loan?"

00:06:47.965 --> 00:06:50.042
Many of these organizations

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.660
were taking on the risk themselves,

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.628
simply hoping that that year,

00:06:53.628 --> 00:06:55.990
the worst wouldn't happen.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.996
Most of the organizations, however,

00:06:57.996 --> 00:07:00.319
were limiting their growth in agriculture.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.991
They couldn't take on this kind of risk.

00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:06.714
These organizations became our customers,

00:07:06.714 --> 00:07:09.913
and when combining credit and insurance,

00:07:09.913 --> 00:07:12.632
interesting things can happen.

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:16.020
Let me tell you one more story.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.870
At the start of February 2012 in western Kenya,

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.869
the rains started, and they started early,

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:25.940
and when rains start early, farmers are encouraged,

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.506
because it usually means that
the season is going to be good.

00:07:29.506 --> 00:07:32.262
So they took out loans and planted.

00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:33.752
For the next three weeks,

00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:36.060
there wasn't a single drop of rain,

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.624
and the crops that had germinated so well

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:41.937
shriveled and died.

00:07:41.937 --> 00:07:44.692
We'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution

00:07:44.692 --> 00:07:45.812
that had provided those loans

00:07:45.812 --> 00:07:49.360
to about 6,000 farmers in that area,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.650
and we called them up and said,

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.350
"Look, we know about the drought.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.014
We've got you.

00:07:54.014 --> 00:07:58.327
We'll give you 200,000 Euros
at the end of the season."

00:07:58.327 --> 00:08:00.126
They said, "Wow, that's great,

00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:02.252
but that'll be late.

00:08:02.252 --> 00:08:04.435
Could you give us the money now?

00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:06.865
Then these farmers can still replant

00:08:06.865 --> 00:08:10.442
and can get a harvest this season."

00:08:10.442 --> 00:08:12.523
So we convinced our insurance partners,

00:08:12.523 --> 00:08:15.898
and later that April, these farmers replanted.

00:08:15.898 --> 00:08:18.692
We took the idea of replanting to a seed company

00:08:18.692 --> 00:08:20.802
and convinced them to price the cost of insurance

00:08:20.802 --> 00:08:22.941
into every bag of seed,

00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:24.920
and in every bag, we packed a card

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.494
that had a number on it,

00:08:26.494 --> 00:08:28.476
and when the farmers would open the card,

00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:30.477
they'd text in that number,

00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:31.850
and that number would actually help us

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.225
to locate the farmer

00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:36.349
and allocate them to a satellite pixel.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.891
A satellite would then measure the rainfall

00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:40.424
for the next three weeks,

00:08:40.424 --> 00:08:42.154
and if it didn't rain,

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:45.560
we'd replace their seed.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.800
One of the first —

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.023
(Applause) — Hold on, I'm not there!

00:08:52.023 --> 00:08:55.180
One of the first beneficiaries
of this replanting guarantee

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.396
was Bosco Mwinyi.

00:08:57.396 --> 00:09:00.087
We visited his farm later that August,

00:09:00.087 --> 00:09:03.643
and I wish I could show you the smile on his face

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:06.107
when he showed us his harvest,

00:09:06.107 --> 00:09:07.740
because it warmed my heart

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.678
and it made me realize why selling insurance

00:09:09.678 --> 00:09:12.388
can be a good thing.

00:09:12.388 --> 00:09:13.936
But you know, he insisted

00:09:13.936 --> 00:09:16.890
that we get his whole harvest in the picture,

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.753
so we had to zoom out a lot.

00:09:20.753 --> 00:09:23.982
Insurance secured his harvest that season,

00:09:23.982 --> 00:09:26.502
and I believe that today,

00:09:26.502 --> 00:09:29.685
we have all the tools to enable African farmers

00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:32.452
to take control of their own destiny.

00:09:32.452 --> 00:09:33.951
No more years of the cup.

00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:37.289
Instead, I am looking forward to, at least somehow,

00:09:37.289 --> 00:09:39.945
the year of the insurance,

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:42.648
or the year of the great harvest.

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:45.850
Thank you.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.464
(Applause)
