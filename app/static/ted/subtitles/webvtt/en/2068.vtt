00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.659
Talking about empowerment is odd,

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.761
because when we talk about empowerment,

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:08.967
what affects us most are the stories.

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:12.179
So I want to begin with an everyday story.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.702
What is it really like to be a young woman in India?

00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:18.974
Now, I've spent the last 27 years of my life

00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:21.073
in India, lived in three small towns,

00:00:21.073 --> 00:00:22.889
two major cities,

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:26.118
and I've had several experiences.

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:27.974
When I was seven,

00:00:27.974 --> 00:00:29.931
a private tutor who used to come home

00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:34.646
to teach me mathematics molested me.

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:37.363
He would put his hand up my skirt.

00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:43.970
He put his hand up my skirt and told me

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.930
he knew how to make me feel good.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.060
At 17, a boy from my high school

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.507
circulated an email

00:00:52.507 --> 00:00:54.940
detailing all the sexually aggressive things

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.704
he could do to me

00:00:57.704 --> 00:01:01.789
because I didn't pay attention to him.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.500
At 19, I helped a friend

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.592
whose parents had forcefully
married her to an older man

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:12.259
escape an abusive marriage.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.401
At 21, when my friend and I were walking

00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:18.734
down the road one afternoon,

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:20.273
a man pulled down his pants

00:01:20.273 --> 00:01:23.483
and masturbated in front of us.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:27.910
We called people for help, and nobody came.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.900
At 25, when I was walking home one evening,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.726
two men on a motorcycle attacked me.

00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:37.843
I spent two nights in the hospital

00:01:37.843 --> 00:01:41.085
recovering from trauma and injuries.

00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:46.305
So throughout my life, I've seen women —

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:48.171
family, friends, colleagues —

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:50.964
live through these experiences,

00:01:50.964 --> 00:01:54.137
and they seldom talk about it.

00:01:54.137 --> 00:01:58.777
So in simple words, life in India is not easy.

00:01:58.777 --> 00:02:02.295
But today I'm not going to talk to you about this fear.

00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:04.049
I'm going to talk to you about an interesting path

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.427
of learning that this fear took me on.

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:11.930
So, what happened one night in December 2012

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.704
changed my life.

00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:17.000
So a young girl, a 23-year-old student,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.904
boarded a bus in Delhi with her male friend.

00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:24.513
There were six men on the bus, young men

00:02:24.513 --> 00:02:27.591
who you might encounter every day in India,

00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:29.923
and the chilling account of what followed

00:02:29.923 --> 00:02:31.667
was played over and over again

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.491
in the Indian and international media.

00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:37.765
This girl was raped repeatedly,

00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:40.745
forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod,

00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:43.996
beaten, bitten, and left to die.

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:46.000
Her friend was gagged, attacked,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.577
and knocked unconscious.

00:02:49.577 --> 00:02:53.761
She died on the 29th of December.

00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:55.739
And at a time when most of us here

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.242
were preparing to welcome the new year,

00:02:58.242 --> 00:03:01.479
India plunged into darkness.

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.645
For the first time in our history,

00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:06.823
men and women in Indian cities

00:03:06.823 --> 00:03:09.014
woke up to the horrific truth

00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:12.536
about the true state of women in the country.

00:03:12.536 --> 00:03:14.955
Now, like many other young women,

00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:17.149
I was absolutely terrified.

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:18.416
I couldn't believe that something like this

00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:21.591
could happen in a national capital.

00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:24.144
I was angry and I was frustrated,

00:03:24.144 --> 00:03:28.247
but most of all, I felt utterly, completely helpless.

00:03:28.247 --> 00:03:30.388
But really, what do you do, right?

00:03:30.388 --> 00:03:32.413
Some write blogs, some ignore it,

00:03:32.413 --> 00:03:34.145
some join protests.

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:36.710
I did all of it. In fact, that was what everyone was doing

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.388
two years ago.

00:03:38.388 --> 00:03:41.367
So the media was filled with stories about

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:43.133
all the horrific deeds

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:45.237
that Indian men are capable of.

00:03:45.237 --> 00:03:46.472
They were compared to animals,

00:03:46.472 --> 00:03:48.659
sexually repressed beasts.

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.663
In fact, so alien and unthinkable was this event

00:03:52.663 --> 00:03:53.977
in an Indian mind

00:03:53.977 --> 00:03:56.393
that the response from the Indian media,

00:03:56.393 --> 00:04:00.300
public and politicians proved one point:

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.179
No one knew what to do.

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:04.776
And no one wanted to be responsible for it.

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:07.260
In fact, these were a few insensitive comments

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.441
which were made in the media

00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:10.468
by prominent people

00:04:10.468 --> 00:04:14.624
in response to sexual violence
against women in general.

00:04:14.624 --> 00:04:17.826
So the first one is made by a member of parliament,

00:04:17.826 --> 00:04:21.219
the second one is made by a spiritual leader,

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.930
and the third one was actually
the defendants' lawyer

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.776
when the girl was fighting for her life

00:04:25.776 --> 00:04:28.630
and she passed away.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.483
Now, as a woman watching this day after day,

00:04:32.483 --> 00:04:34.283
I was tired.

00:04:34.283 --> 00:04:35.927
So as a writer and gender activist,

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:39.176
I have written extensively on women,

00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:41.822
but this time, I realized it was different,

00:04:41.822 --> 00:04:43.403
because a part of me realized

00:04:43.403 --> 00:04:45.751
I was a part of that young woman too,

00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:47.929
and I decided I wanted to change this.

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:51.960
So I did something spontaneous, hasty.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.506
I logged on to a citizen journalism platform

00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:55.962
called iReport,

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.713
and I recorded a video talking about

00:04:58.713 --> 00:05:00.693
what the scene was like in Bangalore.

00:05:00.693 --> 00:05:02.380
I talked about how I felt,

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.722
I talked about the ground realities,

00:05:03.722 --> 00:05:09.227
and I talked about the frustrations of living in India.

00:05:09.227 --> 00:05:12.845
In a few hours, the blog was shared widely,

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:14.680
and comments and thoughts poured in

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.340
from across the world.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.015
In that moment, a few things occurred to me.

00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:23.743
One, technology was always at hand

00:05:23.743 --> 00:05:26.960
for many young women like me.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.504
Two, like me, most young women

00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:33.925
hardly use it to express their views.

00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:37.849
Three, I realized for the first time

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.707
that my voice mattered.

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:43.440
So in the months that followed,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.487
I covered a trail of events in Bangalore

00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:49.469
which had no space in the mainstream news.

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.240
In Cubbon Park, which is a big park in Bangalore,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.840
I gathered with over 100 others

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.749
when groups of young men came forward

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:57.561
to wear skirts to prove that clothing

00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:01.241
does not invite rape.

00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:03.075
When I reported about these events,

00:06:03.075 --> 00:06:06.168
I felt I had charge, I felt like I had a channel

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:10.337
to release all the emotions I had inside me.

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:12.409
I attended the town hall march

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.343
when students held up signs saying

00:06:14.343 --> 00:06:16.872
"Kill them, hang them."

00:06:16.872 --> 00:06:20.699
"You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters."

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.177
I went to a candlelight vigil

00:06:22.177 --> 00:06:24.280
where citizens gathered together

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.237
to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly,

00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:30.277
and I recorded a lot of blogs

00:06:30.277 --> 00:06:32.980
in response to how worrying the situation was

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.249
in India at that point.

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:35.898
["I am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say"]

00:06:35.898 --> 00:06:37.357
Now, the reactions confused me.

00:06:37.357 --> 00:06:40.227
While supportive comments poured
in from across the world,

00:06:40.227 --> 00:06:42.241
as did vicious ones.

00:06:42.241 --> 00:06:43.675
So some called me a hypocrite.

00:06:43.675 --> 00:06:46.438
Some called me a victim, a rape apologist.

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:49.403
Some even said I had a political motive.

00:06:49.403 --> 00:06:51.523
But this one comment kind of describes

00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:56.330
what we are discussing here today.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.440
But I was soon to learn that this was not all.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.429
As empowered as I felt

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:02.879
with the new liberty that this

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:05.236
citizen journalism channel gave me,

00:07:05.236 --> 00:07:08.570
I found myself in an unfamiliar situation.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.737
So sometime last August, I logged onto Facebook

00:07:11.737 --> 00:07:13.140
and I was looking through my news feed,

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.183
and I noticed there was a link

00:07:15.183 --> 00:07:16.856
that was being shared by my friends.

00:07:16.856 --> 00:07:19.039
I clicked on the link; it led me back

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.114
to a report uploaded by an American girl

00:07:23.114 --> 00:07:25.322
called Michaela Cross.

00:07:25.322 --> 00:07:26.710
The report was titled,

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.951
"India: The story you never wanted to hear."

00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:33.096
And in this report, she recounted her firsthand

00:07:33.096 --> 00:07:36.796
account of facing sexual harassment in India.

00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:40.763
She wrote, "There is no way to prepare for the eyes,

00:07:40.763 --> 00:07:42.850
the eyes that every day stared

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.574
with such entitlement at my body,

00:07:45.574 --> 00:07:47.424
with no change of expression

00:07:47.424 --> 00:07:50.072
whether I met their gaze or not.

00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:53.210
Walking to the fruit seller's or the tailor's,

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.309
I got stares so sharp

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:58.746
that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece."

00:07:58.746 --> 00:08:02.640
She called India a traveler's
heaven and a woman's hell.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.656
She said she was stalked, groped,

00:08:04.656 --> 00:08:06.253
and masturbated at.

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:08.692
Now, late that evening, the report went viral.

00:08:08.692 --> 00:08:12.304
It was on news channels across the world.

00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:13.910
Everyone was discussing it.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.018
It had over a million views,

00:08:15.018 --> 00:08:16.923
a thousand comments and shares,

00:08:16.923 --> 00:08:18.837
and I found myself witnessing

00:08:18.837 --> 00:08:21.401
a very similar thing.

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:24.097
The media was caught in this vicious cycle

00:08:24.097 --> 00:08:26.395
of opinion and outburst

00:08:26.395 --> 00:08:29.700
and no outcome whatsoever.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.105
So that night, as I sat wondering

00:08:32.105 --> 00:08:33.437
how I should respond,

00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:35.847
I found myself filled with doubt.

00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:39.208
You see, as a writer, I approached this issue

00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:41.586
as an observer,

00:08:41.586 --> 00:08:45.964
as an Indian, I felt embarrassment and disbelief,

00:08:45.964 --> 00:08:50.443
and as an activist, I looked
at it as a defender of rights,

00:08:50.443 --> 00:08:52.578
but as a citizen journalist,

00:08:52.578 --> 00:08:55.852
I suddenly felt very vulnerable.

00:08:55.852 --> 00:08:58.183
I mean, here she was, a young woman

00:08:58.183 --> 00:08:59.583
who was using a channel to talk about

00:08:59.583 --> 00:09:01.721
her experience just as I was,

00:09:01.731 --> 00:09:04.545
and yet I felt unsettled.

00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:06.467
You see, no one ever tells you

00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:09.407
that true empowerment comes from giving yourself

00:09:09.407 --> 00:09:11.783
the permission to think and act.

00:09:11.783 --> 00:09:14.245
Empowerment is often made to sound as if

00:09:14.245 --> 00:09:17.442
it's an ideal, it's a wonderful outcome.

00:09:17.442 --> 00:09:19.274
When we talk about empowerment, we often

00:09:19.274 --> 00:09:22.559
talk about giving people access to materials,

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:25.295
giving them access to tools.

00:09:25.295 --> 00:09:27.744
But the thing is, empowerment is an emotion.

00:09:27.744 --> 00:09:29.206
It's a feeling.

00:09:29.206 --> 00:09:31.938
The first step to empowerment

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:34.818
is to give yourself the authority,

00:09:34.818 --> 00:09:36.793
the key to independent will,

00:09:36.793 --> 00:09:38.393
and for women everywhere,

00:09:38.393 --> 00:09:40.941
no matter who we are or where we come from,

00:09:40.941 --> 00:09:44.261
that is the most difficult step.

00:09:44.261 --> 00:09:46.870
We fear the sound of our own voice,

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.656
for it means admission, but it is this that gives us

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:52.740
the power to change our environment.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.581
Now in this situation where I was faced

00:09:54.581 --> 00:09:57.267
with so many different kinds of realities,

00:09:57.267 --> 00:09:58.753
I was unsure how to judge,

00:09:58.753 --> 00:10:01.838
because I didn't know what it would mean for me.

00:10:01.838 --> 00:10:04.843
I feared to judge because I
didn't know what it would be

00:10:04.843 --> 00:10:08.124
if I didn't support the same view as this girl.

00:10:08.124 --> 00:10:09.490
I didn't know what it would mean for me

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:14.370
if I was challenging someone else's truth.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.863
But yet, it was simple.

00:10:15.863 --> 00:10:17.312
I had to make a decision:

00:10:17.312 --> 00:10:20.502
Should I speak up or should I stay quiet?

00:10:20.502 --> 00:10:22.786
So after a lot of thought,

00:10:22.786 --> 00:10:25.282
I recorded a video blog in response,

00:10:25.282 --> 00:10:27.252
and I told Michaela, well,

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.955
there are different sides to India,

00:10:29.955 --> 00:10:35.364
and I also tried to explain

00:10:35.364 --> 00:10:37.425
that things would be okay

00:10:37.425 --> 00:10:40.091
and I expressed my regret for what she had faced.

00:10:40.091 --> 00:10:42.692
And a few days later, I was invited to talk

00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:44.061
on air with her,

00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:48.181
and for the first time, I reached out to this girl

00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:50.982
who I had never met, who was so far away,

00:10:50.982 --> 00:10:53.820
but yet I felt so close to.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.350
Since this report came to light,

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.655
more young people than ever

00:10:58.655 --> 00:11:02.006
were discussing sexual harassment on the campus,

00:11:02.006 --> 00:11:04.797
and the university that Michaela belonged to

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:08.645
gave her the assistance she needed.

00:11:08.645 --> 00:11:10.990
The university even took measures

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.049
to train its students to equip them

00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:14.685
with the skills that they need

00:11:14.685 --> 00:11:18.155
to confront challenges such as harassment,

00:11:18.155 --> 00:11:22.448
and for the first the time, I felt I wasn't alone.

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:24.534
You see, if there's anything that I've learned

00:11:24.534 --> 00:11:27.169
as an active citizen journalist

00:11:27.169 --> 00:11:30.252
over the past few years,

00:11:30.252 --> 00:11:34.225
it is our dire lack as a society to actively find

00:11:34.225 --> 00:11:37.222
avenues where our voices can be heard.

00:11:37.222 --> 00:11:41.526
We don't realize that when we are standing up,

00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:43.368
we are not just standing up as individuals,

00:11:43.368 --> 00:11:46.605
we are standing up for our communities,

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:48.464
our friends, our peers.

00:11:48.464 --> 00:11:51.837
Most of us say that women are denied their rights,

00:11:51.837 --> 00:11:54.213
but the truth is, oftentimes,

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:57.613
women deny themselves these rights.

00:11:57.613 --> 00:12:00.250
In a recent survey in India,

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.781
95 percent of the women who work in I.T.,

00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:08.197
aviation, hospitality and call centers,

00:12:08.197 --> 00:12:10.764
said they didn't feel safe returning home alone

00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:14.150
after work in the late hours or in the evening.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.551
In Bangalore, where I come from,

00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:18.017
this number is 85 percent.

00:12:18.017 --> 00:12:20.563
In rural areas in India,

00:12:20.563 --> 00:12:23.720
if anything is to go by the recent

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.287
gang rapes in Badaun and acid attacks in Odisha

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.308
and Aligarh are supposed to go by,

00:12:28.308 --> 00:12:31.885
we need to act really soon.

00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:33.578
Don't get me wrong,

00:12:33.578 --> 00:12:36.285
the challenges that women will face

00:12:36.285 --> 00:12:39.077
in telling their stories is real,

00:12:39.077 --> 00:12:41.782
but we need to start pursuing

00:12:41.782 --> 00:12:44.269
and trying to identify mediums

00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:45.760
to participate in our system

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.124
and not just pursue the media blindly.

00:12:50.124 --> 00:12:53.122
Today, more women than ever

00:12:53.122 --> 00:12:54.767
are standing up and questioning

00:12:54.767 --> 00:12:56.146
the government in India,

00:12:56.146 --> 00:12:59.169
and this is a result of that courage.

00:12:59.169 --> 00:13:02.222
There is a sixfold increase in women

00:13:02.222 --> 00:13:03.784
reporting harassment,

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:05.173
and the government passed

00:13:05.173 --> 00:13:08.149
the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2013

00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:11.968
to protect women against sexual assault.

00:13:11.968 --> 00:13:13.920
As I end this talk,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.040
I just want to say

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.620
that I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets,

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.572
but let us speak up.

00:13:23.572 --> 00:13:26.241
Let us fight the shame and talk about it.

00:13:26.241 --> 00:13:29.761
It could be a platform, a community,

00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:33.648
your loved one, whoever or whatever you choose,

00:13:33.648 --> 00:13:35.740
but let us speak up.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.800
The truth is, the end to this problem

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.542
begins with us.

00:13:40.542 --> 00:13:42.187
Thank you.

00:13:42.187 --> 00:13:45.748
(Applause)
