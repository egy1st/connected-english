00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And in my idea, heaven is satisfied curiosity.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
where I can just lie down with my belly down,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
like I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I can basically look everywhere I want,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
see every movie I've always wanted to see.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in the subway in New York when you're reading,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
there's something really soothing and easy.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
because I discovered ...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it took me a while to understand it,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
with objects than with people, I finally decided to really embrace this passion.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Just to give you an example:

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
this is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We were in Queens,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so we were in the small, small, small boondocks.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That was one of the funnest moments of my career.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But it's not only that.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The typeface -- the typeface is Helvetica;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
it's its 50th anniversary this year.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And so I start thinking -- Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
trying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and the movie starts playing in my head already.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
is going to have the same effect on you.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
you know when they do homeworks at home?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Instead of having a tray with two peas, I was hoping that they would go

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So, everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and at MoMA we put out some books

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And a lot of nationalism came in.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
For instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but they were very proud

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
they had moonshine, laundry detergents and liquid nails.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And I keep it going, and I just got,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
(Laughter)

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
also, this suggestion from Milan:

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
it's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted;

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to define all the lanes of traffic.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So, think of your own,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Different parts of the world have a knack for different things.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that you don't see elsewhere, but the contemporary art was terrible.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
In Italy, in Milan especially,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
But design -- oh, my God.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
What you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
we are all so sophisticated.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It's just what you find at the store.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I'm always amazed -- three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and take you to the galleries.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
It's really interesting:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
what many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
this kind of overdesigned -- in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
decoration, interior decoration.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
They think of somebody choosing fabrics.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Design can be that, of course, but it can also be this.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
to design gas masks for people,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
because, as you know, Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So, what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
so that instead of being completely strangled, a teenager can also sip a Coke.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And then they make a little tent for the baby.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and it is miles away from the fancy furniture,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
but still, it's part of my same field of passion.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
harness the power of MoMA

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
because it's great to work there. You really have power

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
which is to try and see what's going on in the world

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and try to use that authority in order to make things better.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
There have been many episodes,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
were involved in two competitions:

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that then sparked a whole line of furniture.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And then there was good design for very low price.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So, I started out in '95 with this exhibition that was called

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It was about a new phase, in my opinion, in the world of design

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California;

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
at that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So you see, the range is really quite diverse.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And then, for instance, this other exhibition

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that was entitled Workspheres in 2001,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And you see IDEO there.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It was beautiful -- it was called Personal Skies.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The idea was that if you had a cubicle, you could project a sky on top

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
of your head and have your own "Cielo in Una Stanza" -- a sky in a room --

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
it's a very famous Italian song.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And other examples: this was Marti Guixe about working on the go,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and Hella Jongerius, my favorite, about how to work at home.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design:

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and then what they do at the end -- if they are good --

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
is much more than the sum of its parts.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
that is really quite amazing

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and also quite hilarious.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
The idea behind her work was that

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
at that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Instead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together."

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Yeah, that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
but I don't want to focus on my shows.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I would like, instead, to talk about how great some designers are.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I've always had a hard time with the word "maverick."

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I came to the United States 13 years ago, and to this day

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I have to ask, "What does that mean?"

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Therefore, he was not following everybody's lead,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and therefore, he was a maverick.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So, designers do need to be mavericks,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
because the best way to design a successful object --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and also an object that we were missing before --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
is to pretend that either it never existed

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and it ended at the beginning of last year.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
until, slowly but surely, it came back --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
as a half-full glass instead of half-empty --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and it was about protection and safety.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
these kind of water-sterilizing straws,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
so it was really wide-ranging.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
It also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore;

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
It's a suit for civil disobedience.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
so your heartbeat is amplified --

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and the police is reminded;

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
it's like having a flower in front of the rifle.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So, designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
functional, but they're functional to our understanding of issues.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
so it disappears completely and you can hide away;

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States --

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA;

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
the ultimate shelter is your sense of self,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
This is Cindy van den Bremen, who is a Dutch designer

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
that's done this series of Capsters.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000
They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski, play tennis,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And sometimes by doing this kind of research,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
you encounter such beautiful ideas of design.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Twan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
stimulation for children that have psychological impairments.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
They're quite beautiful.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you --

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
because autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside --

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
in the mirror and regain a sense of self.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Design really looks upon the whole world

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and it considers the world in all of its different ranges.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I want to make this point by showing you two examples of

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
design coming from a sense of economy -- very, very clear limits.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
This is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
they're so smart and economical.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Fernando and Humberto Campana, who got inspired by the poverty and

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
selling for an enormous amount of money.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So really, design takes everything into account,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
as we become more and more wireless and impalpable,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
designers, instead, want us to be hands-on.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Sometimes hammer-on.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
your imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
to these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
(Laughter)

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
It's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna, whose name was Marchetti,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
explain how the innovation in the military industry --

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
therefore, secret innovation -- and the innovation in the

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And that makes sense.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
In moments of war there's great technological innovation,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and in the world you have to do without --

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
well, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
you had to do without aluminum.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
available for the civilian market.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance:

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I think that this is a strange moment.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
But it surely is a very important moment for design,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
because not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
technology making open-source possible also in the world of design,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
but also the idea of sustainability --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
but also sustainability of human interrelationships --

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
is very much part of the work of so many designers.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And that's why designers, more and more, are working on behaviors

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
rather than on objects.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Especially the good ones, not all of them.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
which is quite fantastic.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
He's another young designer from France who's working --

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies --

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
on new ways to engage patients, especially children,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
in this particular kind of delivery.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Similarly, there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000
so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste, orally.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
The next show that I'm going to work on --

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here --

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
is about the relationship between design and science.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common --

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
the common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations --

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
as an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and therefore, really work at the scale of the very small

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
to make it very big and very meaningful.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Thank you. (Applause)
