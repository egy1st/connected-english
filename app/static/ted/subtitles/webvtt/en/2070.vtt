00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.539
Hi, kids.

00:00:02.539 --> 00:00:04.099
(Laughter)

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:06.683
I'm 71.

00:00:06.683 --> 00:00:08.778
(Applause)

00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:11.580
My husband is 76.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.040
My parents are in their late 90s,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.730
and Olivia, the dog, is 16.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.130
So let's talk about aging.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.548
Let me tell you how I feel

00:00:21.548 --> 00:00:23.875
when I see my wrinkles in the mirror

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:27.200
and I realize that some parts of me have dropped

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.832
and I can't find them down there.

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:30.970
(Laughter)

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.169
Mary Oliver says in one of her poems,

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:37.848
"Tell me, what is it that you plan to do

00:00:37.848 --> 00:00:41.531
with your one wild and precious life?"

00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:45.834
Me, I intend to live passionately.

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:47.846
When do we start aging?

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:50.233
Society decides when we are old,

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:54.464
usually around 65, when we get Medicare,

00:00:54.464 --> 00:00:57.230
but we really start aging at birth.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.190
We are aging right now,

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.383
and we all experience it differently.

00:01:02.383 --> 00:01:05.825
We all feel younger than our real age,

00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:07.996
because the spirit never ages.

00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:11.291
I am still 17.

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:14.820
Sophia Loren. Look at her.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.693
She says that everything you see

00:01:17.693 --> 00:01:19.976
she owes to spaghetti.

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:22.464
I tried it and gained 10 pounds

00:01:22.464 --> 00:01:24.566
in the wrong places.

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:29.718
But attitude, aging is also attitude and health.

00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:33.418
But my real mentor in this journey of aging

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:34.959
is Olga Murray.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.749
This California girl at 60

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:41.450
started working in Nepal to save young girls

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.509
from domestic bondage.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.900
At 88, she has saved 12,000 girls,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.393
and she has changed the culture in the country.

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:51.383
(Applause)

00:01:51.383 --> 00:01:54.830
Now it is illegal for fathers

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.986
to sell their daughters into servitude.

00:01:57.986 --> 00:02:00.513
She has also founded orphanages

00:02:00.513 --> 00:02:02.543
and nutritional clinics.

00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:04.196
She is always happy

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:07.697
and eternally young.

00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:11.725
What have I lost in the last decades?

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:13.896
People, of course,

00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:17.743
places, and the boundless energy of my youth,

00:02:17.743 --> 00:02:19.588
and I'm beginning to lose independence,

00:02:19.588 --> 00:02:21.973
and that scares me.

00:02:21.973 --> 00:02:26.146
Ram Dass says that dependency hurts,

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:29.039
but if you accept it, there is less suffering.

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.175
After a very bad stroke,

00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:34.527
his ageless soul watches the changes

00:02:34.527 --> 00:02:36.788
in the body with tenderness,

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:41.300
and he is grateful to the people who help him.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.370
What have I gained?

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.431
Freedom: I don't have to prove anything anymore.

00:02:48.431 --> 00:02:50.996
I'm not stuck in the idea of who I was,

00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:52.126
who I want to be,

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:55.990
or what other people expect me to be.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.040
I don't have to please men anymore,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.888
only animals.

00:03:02.888 --> 00:03:06.430
I keep telling my superego to back off

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.612
and let me enjoy what I still have.

00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:10.671
My body may be falling apart,

00:03:10.671 --> 00:03:14.125
but my brain is not, yet.

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:16.172
I love my brain.

00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:19.130
I feel lighter.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.407
I don't carry grudges, ambition, vanity,

00:03:24.407 --> 00:03:26.262
none of the deadly sins that are not even

00:03:26.262 --> 00:03:28.456
worth the trouble.

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:30.200
It's great to let go.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.290
I should have started sooner.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.036
And I also feel softer

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:39.060
because I'm not scared of being vulnerable.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.750
I don't see it as weakness anymore.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.274
And I've gained spirituality.

00:03:45.274 --> 00:03:47.197
I'm aware that before,

00:03:47.197 --> 00:03:49.493
death was in the neighborhood.

00:03:49.493 --> 00:03:54.794
Now, it's next door, or in my house.

00:03:54.794 --> 00:03:57.263
I try to live mindfully

00:03:57.263 --> 00:03:59.389
and be present in the moment.

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.150
By the way, the Dalai Lama

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.270
is someone who has aged beautifully,

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.677
but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate?

00:04:05.677 --> 00:04:09.261
(Laughter)

00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:15.206
Meditation helps.

00:04:15.206 --> 00:04:19.173
(Video) Child: Ommm. Ommm. Ommm.

00:04:19.173 --> 00:04:21.110
Isabel Allende: Ommm. Ommm. There it is.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.165
And it's good to start early.

00:04:23.165 --> 00:04:26.836
You know, for a vain female like myself,

00:04:26.836 --> 00:04:30.233
it's very hard to age in this culture.

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:34.958
Inside, I feel good, I feel charming, seductive, sexy.

00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.890
Nobody else sees that. (Laughter)

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.110
I'm invisible.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.754
I want to be the center of attention.

00:04:41.754 --> 00:04:44.812
I hate to be invisible.

00:04:44.812 --> 00:04:46.893
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:46.893 --> 00:04:48.992
This is Grace Dammann.

00:04:48.992 --> 00:04:51.415
She has been in a wheelchair for six years

00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:53.780
after a terrible car accident.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.637
She says that there is nothing more sensual

00:04:57.637 --> 00:04:59.137
than a hot shower,

00:04:59.137 --> 00:05:00.934
that every drop of water

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:04.144
is a blessing to the senses.

00:05:04.144 --> 00:05:06.512
She doesn't see herself as disabled.

00:05:06.512 --> 00:05:10.518
In her mind, she's still surfing in the ocean.

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:15.152
Ethel Seiderman, a feisty, beloved activist

00:05:15.152 --> 00:05:17.886
in the place where I live in California.

00:05:17.886 --> 00:05:21.778
She wears red patent shoes,

00:05:21.778 --> 00:05:24.030
and her mantra is that one scarf is nice

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.815
but two is better.

00:05:25.815 --> 00:05:28.618
She has been a widow for nine years,

00:05:28.618 --> 00:05:30.650
but she's not looking for another mate.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.735
She says that there is only a limited number

00:05:33.735 --> 00:05:35.985
of ways you can screw —

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:37.999
well, she says it in another way —

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.967
and she has tried them all.

00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:43.006
(Laughter)

00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:44.291
I, on the other hand,

00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:47.909
I still have erotic fantasies with Antonio Banderas —

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.187
(Laughter) —

00:05:49.187 --> 00:05:53.537
and my poor husband has to put up with it.

00:05:53.537 --> 00:05:55.795
So how can I stay passionate?

00:05:55.795 --> 00:05:59.747
I cannot will myself to be passionate at 71.

00:05:59.747 --> 00:06:01.986
I have been training for some time,

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:05.743
and when I feel flat and bored, I fake it.

00:06:05.743 --> 00:06:08.409
Attitude, attitude.

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.143
How do I train? I train by saying yes

00:06:11.143 --> 00:06:12.954
to whatever comes my way:

00:06:12.954 --> 00:06:15.732
drama, comedy, tragedy,

00:06:15.732 --> 00:06:18.724
love, death, losses.

00:06:18.724 --> 00:06:20.806
Yes to life.

00:06:20.806 --> 00:06:24.237
And I train by trying to stay in love.

00:06:24.237 --> 00:06:25.690
It doesn't always work,

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.544
but you cannot blame me for trying.

00:06:28.544 --> 00:06:31.043
And, on a final note,

00:06:31.043 --> 00:06:35.030
retirement in Spanish is jubilación.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.777
Jubilation. Celebration.

00:06:37.777 --> 00:06:39.263
We have paid our dues.

00:06:39.263 --> 00:06:41.340
We have contributed to society.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.673
Now it's our time, and it's a great time.

00:06:44.673 --> 00:06:47.710
Unless you are ill or very poor,

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.231
you have choices.

00:06:49.231 --> 00:06:51.884
I have chosen to stay passionate,

00:06:51.884 --> 00:06:54.483
engaged with an open heart.

00:06:54.483 --> 00:06:57.250
I am working on it every day.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.682
Want to join me?

00:07:00.682 --> 00:07:02.345
Thank you.

00:07:02.345 --> 00:07:07.644
(Applause)

00:07:07.644 --> 00:07:11.100
June Cohen: So Isabel —
IA: Thank you.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.461
JC: First of all,

00:07:14.461 --> 00:07:17.210
I never like to presume to
speak for the TED community,

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.388
but I would like to tell you that I have a feeling

00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:21.222
we can all agree that you are still charming,

00:07:21.222 --> 00:07:23.191
seductive and sexy. Yes?

00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:25.686
IA: Aww, thank you.
(Applause)

00:07:25.686 --> 00:07:28.172
JC: Hands down.
IA: No, it's makeup.

00:07:28.172 --> 00:07:29.612
Moderator: Now, would it be awkward

00:07:29.612 --> 00:07:32.132
if I asked you a follow-up question
about your erotic fantasies?

00:07:32.132 --> 00:07:33.810
IA: Oh, of course. About what?

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.811
(Laughter)

00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:37.847
Moderator: About your erotic fantasies.
IA: With Antonio Banderas.

00:07:37.847 --> 00:07:40.626
Moderator: I was just wondering
if you have anything more to share.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:45.800
IA: Well, one of them is that — (Laughter)

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.929
One of them is that I place a naked Antonio Banderas

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:50.862
on a Mexican tortilla,

00:07:50.862 --> 00:07:54.552
I slather him with guacamole and salsa,

00:07:54.552 --> 00:07:58.051
I roll him up, and I eat him. (Laughter)

00:07:58.051 --> 00:07:59.844
Thank you.

00:07:59.844 --> 00:08:03.210
(Applause)
