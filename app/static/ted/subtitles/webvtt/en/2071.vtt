00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:04.362
How many times have you used
the word "awesome" today?

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:08.497
Once? Twice? Seventeen times?

00:00:08.497 --> 00:00:09.863
Do you remember what you were describing

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:11.213
when you used the word?

00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:14.453
No, I didn't think so, because
it's come down to this, people:

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:16.355
You're using the word incorrectly,

00:00:16.355 --> 00:00:18.424
and tonight I hope to show you

00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:21.506
how to put the "awe" back in "awesome."

00:00:21.506 --> 00:00:24.330
Recently, I was dining at an outdoor cafe,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.243
and the server came up to our table,

00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:27.790
and asked us if we had dined there before,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.739
and I said, "Yes, yes, we have."

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.519
And she said, "Awesome."

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:34.754
And I thought, "Really?

00:00:34.754 --> 00:00:37.376
Awesome or just merely good

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:42.040
that we decided to visit your restaurant again?"

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.400
The other day, one of my coworkers asked me

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.880
if I could save that file as a PDF,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.621
and I said, "Well, of course," and he said, "Awesome."

00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:56.848
Seriously, can saving anything as a PDF

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.796
be awesome?

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:02.956
Sadly, the frequent overuse of the word "awesome"

00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:07.123
has now replaced words like "great" and "thank you."

00:01:07.123 --> 00:01:11.495
So Webster's dictionary defines the word "awesome"

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:15.623
as fear mingled with admiration or reverence,

00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:19.019
a feeling produced by something majestic.

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.943
Now, with that in mind,

00:01:20.943 --> 00:01:24.240
was your Quiznos sandwich awesome?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.510
How about that parking space? Was that awesome?

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.056
Or that game the other day? Was that awesome?

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:31.440
The answer is no, no and no.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.113
A sandwich can be delicious,

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:35.415
that parking space can be nearby,

00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:38.155
and that game can be a blowout,

00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:42.380
but not everything can be awesome.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.010
(Laughter)

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.659
So when you use the word "awesome"

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.977
to describe the most mundane of things,

00:01:48.977 --> 00:01:51.880
you're taking away the very power of the word.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.298
This author says, "Snowy days

00:01:54.298 --> 00:01:58.573
or finding money in your pants is awesome."

00:01:58.573 --> 00:01:59.451
(Laughter)

00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:01.433
Um, no, it is not,

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:07.831
and we need to raise the bar for this poor schmuck.
(Laughter)

00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:11.401
So in other words, if you have
everything, you value nothing.

00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:13.771
It's a lot like drinking from a firehose

00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:17.719
like this jackass right here.

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.138
There's no dynamic, there's no highs or lows,

00:02:20.138 --> 00:02:22.000
if everything is awesome.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.165
Ladies and gentlemen, here are 10 things

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:26.083
that are truly awesome.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:28.766
Imagine, if you will, having to schlep

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:30.227
everything on your back.

00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:32.220
Wouldn't this be easier for me

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.188
if I could roll this home?

00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:36.517
Yes, so I think I'll invent the wheel.

00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:39.389
The wheel, ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.186
Is the wheel awesome? Say it with me.

00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:45.809
Yes, the wheel is awesome!

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:47.870
The Great Pyramids were the tallest

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.488
man-made structure in the world

00:02:49.488 --> 00:02:51.872
for 4,000 years.

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:55.411
Pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks

00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:59.427
just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone.

00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:00.780
Were the Great Pyramids awesome?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.030
Yes, the pyramids were awesome.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.176
The Grand Canyon. Come on.

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:08.404
It's almost 80 million years old.

00:03:08.404 --> 00:03:10.171
Is the Grand Canyon awesome?

00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:11.712
Yes, the Grand Canyon is.

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:16.470
Louis Daguerre invented photography in 1829,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.989
and earlier today,

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.954
when you whipped out your smartphone

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:22.566
and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich,

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:24.311
and you know who you are —

00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:26.527
(Laughter) —

00:03:26.527 --> 00:03:28.867
wasn't that easier than exposing the image

00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:31.443
to copper plates coated with iodized silver?

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:33.515
I mean, come on. Is photography awesome?

00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:35.405
Yes, photography is awesome.

00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:37.818
D-Day, June 6, 1944,

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:40.186
the Allied invasion of Normandy,

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:44.282
the largest amphibious invasion in world history.

00:03:44.282 --> 00:03:47.422
Was D-Day awesome? Yes, it was awesome.

00:03:47.422 --> 00:03:49.973
Did you eat food today? Did you eat?

00:03:49.973 --> 00:03:52.301
Then you can thank the honeybee, that's the one,

00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:55.395
because if crops aren't pollinated, we can't grow food,

00:03:55.395 --> 00:03:57.217
and then we're all going to die.

00:03:57.217 --> 00:03:58.337
It's just like that.

00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:00.682
But it's not like a flower can just get up

00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:03.154
and have sex with another flower,

00:04:03.154 --> 00:04:05.485
although that would be awesome.

00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:08.304
(Laughter)

00:04:08.304 --> 00:04:11.242
Bees are awesome. Are you kidding me?

00:04:11.242 --> 00:04:15.198
Landing on the moon! Come on!

00:04:15.198 --> 00:04:18.171
Apollo 11. Are you kidding me?

00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:20.995
Sixty-six years after the Wright Brothers

00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:23.605
took off from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,

00:04:23.605 --> 00:04:26.934
Neil Armstrong was 240,000 miles away.

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.959
That's like from here to the moon.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:31.195
(Laughter)

00:04:31.195 --> 00:04:33.549
That's one small step for a man,

00:04:33.549 --> 00:04:36.131
one giant leap for awesome!

00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:38.152
You're damn right, it was.

00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:41.928
Woodstock, 1969: Rolling Stone Magazine said

00:04:41.928 --> 00:04:45.097
this changed the history of rock and roll.

00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:47.707
Tickets were only 24 dollars back then.

00:04:47.707 --> 00:04:51.339
You can't even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now.

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:54.459
Jimi Hendrix's version of "The Star-Spangled Banner"

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:56.690
was the most iconic.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.238
Was Woodstock awesome? Yes, it was awesome.

00:04:59.238 --> 00:05:01.987
Sharks! They're at the top of the food chain.

00:05:01.987 --> 00:05:04.424
Sharks have multiple rows of teeth

00:05:04.424 --> 00:05:05.669
that grow in their jaw

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.067
and they move forward like a conveyor belt.

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:12.760
Some sharks can lose 30,000 teeth in their lifetime.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.357
Does awesome inspire fear?

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:19.103
Oh, hell yeah, sharks are awesome!

00:05:19.103 --> 00:05:21.930
The Internet was born in 1982

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.695
and it instantly took over global communication,

00:05:25.695 --> 00:05:27.798
and later tonight, when all these PowerPoints

00:05:27.798 --> 00:05:29.756
are uplifted to the Internet

00:05:29.756 --> 00:05:32.580
so that a guy in Siberia can get drunk

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.549
and watch this crap,

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:38.303
the Internet is awesome.

00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:40.790
And finally, finally some of you can't wait

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.952
to come up and tell me how
awesome my PowerPoint was.

00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:45.620
I will save you the time.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.282
It was not awesome, but it was true,

00:05:48.282 --> 00:05:50.060
and I hope it was entertaining,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.407
and out of all the audiences I've ever had,

00:05:53.407 --> 00:05:56.107
y'all are the most recent. Thank you and good night.

00:05:56.107 --> 00:06:00.107
(Applause)
