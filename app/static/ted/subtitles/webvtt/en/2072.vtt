00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:03.001
Why does the universe exist?

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.996
Why is there — Okay. Okay. (Laughter)

00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:09.838
This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn.

00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:13.414
Why is there a world, why are we in it,

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:15.293
and why is there something rather than nothing at all?

00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:19.939
I mean, this is the super ultimate "why" question?

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.174
So I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence,

00:00:22.174 --> 00:00:23.730
the puzzle of existence,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.644
where we are now in addressing it,

00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:28.894
and why you should care,

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:30.810
and I hope you do care.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.636
The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that

00:00:33.636 --> 00:00:37.416
those who don't wonder about
the contingency of their existence,

00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:40.273
of the contingency of the world's existence,

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.936
are mentally deficient.

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:45.883
That's a little harsh, but still. (Laughter)

00:00:45.883 --> 00:00:47.560
So this has been called the most sublime

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.854
and awesome mystery,

00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:52.523
the deepest and most far-reaching question

00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:53.583
man can pose.

00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:55.297
It's obsessed great thinkers.

00:00:55.297 --> 00:00:56.901
Ludwig Wittgenstein, perhaps the greatest

00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:59.231
philosopher of the 20th century,

00:00:59.231 --> 00:01:01.714
was astonished that there should be a world at all.

00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:05.718
He wrote in his "Tractatus," Proposition 4.66,

00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:08.408
"It is not how things are in the world

00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:09.760
that is the mystical,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.095
it's that the world exists."

00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:14.313
And if you don't like taking your epigrams

00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:17.224
from a philosopher, try a scientist.

00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:19.825
John Archibald Wheeler, one of the great physicists

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:21.051
of the 20th century,

00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:22.976
the teacher of Richard Feynman,

00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:25.636
the coiner of the term "black hole,"

00:01:25.636 --> 00:01:28.059
he said, "I want to know

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:29.792
how come the quantum,

00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:32.936
how come the universe, how come existence?"

00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:34.935
And my friend Martin Amis —

00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:37.612
sorry that I'll be doing a lot of
name-dropping in this talk,

00:01:37.612 --> 00:01:38.987
so get used to it —

00:01:38.987 --> 00:01:43.963
my dear friend Martin Amis once said

00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:47.183
that we're about five Einsteins away from answering

00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:49.219
the mystery of where the universe came from.

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.200
And I've no doubt there are five Einsteins

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.387
in the audience tonight.

00:01:53.387 --> 00:01:54.890
Any Einsteins? Show of hands? No? No? No?

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.052
No Einsteins? Okay.

00:01:56.052 --> 00:02:00.274
So this question, why is there
something rather than nothing,

00:02:00.274 --> 00:02:02.242
this sublime question, was posed rather late

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:04.552
in intellectual history.

00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:07.031
It was towards the end of the 17th century,

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:09.993
the philosopher Leibniz who asked it,

00:02:09.993 --> 00:02:11.736
a very smart guy, Leibniz,

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:13.886
who invented the calculus

00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:16.740
independently of Isaac Newton,
at about the same time,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.342
but for Leibniz, who asked why is
there something rather than nothing,

00:02:19.342 --> 00:02:21.535
this was not a great mystery.

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:23.931
He either was or pretended to be

00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:26.687
an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook,

00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:29.702
and he said it's obvious why the world exists:

00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:32.164
because God created it.

00:02:32.164 --> 00:02:35.449
And God created, indeed, out of nothing at all.

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:36.960
That's how powerful God is.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.602
He doesn't need any preexisting
materials to fashion a world out of.

00:02:40.602 --> 00:02:42.762
He can make it out of sheer nothingness,

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:44.236
creation ex nihilo.

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:45.181
And by the way, this is what

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:48.020
most Americans today believe.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.734
There is no mystery of existence for them.

00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:51.302
God made it.

00:02:51.302 --> 00:02:53.888
So let's put this in an equation.

00:02:53.888 --> 00:02:56.515
I don't have any slides so
I'm going to mime my visuals,

00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:57.950
so use your imaginations.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.804
So it's God + nothing = the world.

00:03:03.804 --> 00:03:07.118
Okay? Now that's the equation.

00:03:07.118 --> 00:03:08.851
And so maybe you don't believe in God.

00:03:08.851 --> 00:03:10.681
Maybe you're a scientific atheist

00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:14.015
or an unscientific atheist,
and you don't believe in God,

00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:15.433
and you're not happy with it.

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:18.137
By the way, even if we have this equation,

00:03:18.137 --> 00:03:20.039
God + nothing = the world,

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.725
there's already a problem:

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:24.759
Why does God exist?

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.962
God doesn't exist by logic alone

00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:28.775
unless you believe the ontological argument,

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:31.102
and I hope you don't, because
it's not a good argument.

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:34.263
So it's conceivable, if God were to exist,

00:03:34.263 --> 00:03:37.413
he might wonder, I'm eternal, I'm all-powerful,

00:03:37.413 --> 00:03:39.843
but where did I come from?

00:03:39.843 --> 00:03:42.013
(Laughter)

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.432
Whence then am I?

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:46.640
God speaks in a more formal English.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.629
(Laughter)

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.677
And so one theory is that God was so bored with

00:03:51.677 --> 00:03:53.466
pondering the puzzle of His own existence

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:56.388
that He created the world just to distract himself.

00:03:56.388 --> 00:03:58.500
But anyway, let's forget about God.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.857
Take God out of the equation: We have

00:03:59.857 --> 00:04:02.980
________ + nothing = the world.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.761
Now, if you're a Buddhist,

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:06.505
you might want to stop right there,

00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:08.474
because essentially what you've got is

00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:10.050
nothing = the world,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.563
and by symmetry of identity, that means

00:04:11.563 --> 00:04:13.918
the world = nothing. Okay?

00:04:13.918 --> 00:04:16.337
And to a Buddhist, the world
is just a whole lot of nothing.

00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:19.443
It's just a big cosmic vacuity.

00:04:19.443 --> 00:04:21.995
And we think there's a lot of something out there

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.560
but that's because we're enslaved by our desires.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.271
If we let our desires melt away,

00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:30.151
we'll see the world for what it truly is,

00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:32.131
a vacuity, nothingness,

00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:34.313
and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana

00:04:34.313 --> 00:04:36.136
which has been defined as having

00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:39.454
just enough life to enjoy being dead. (Laughter)

00:04:39.454 --> 00:04:41.333
So that's the Buddhist thinking.

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:44.832
But I'm a Westerner, and I'm still concerned

00:04:44.832 --> 00:04:46.815
with the puzzle of existence, so I've got

00:04:46.815 --> 00:04:48.423
________ + —

00:04:48.423 --> 00:04:50.581
this is going to get serious in a minute, so —

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:53.607
________ + nothing = the world.

00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:54.830
What are we going to put in that blank?

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.678
Well, how about science?

00:04:56.678 --> 00:05:00.229
Science is our best guide to the nature of reality,

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.244
and the most fundamental science is physics.

00:05:03.244 --> 00:05:06.214
That tells us what naked reality really is,

00:05:06.214 --> 00:05:08.840
that reveals what I call TAUFOTU,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.830
the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.482
So maybe physics can fill this blank,

00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:19.544
and indeed, since about the late 1960s or around 1970,

00:05:19.544 --> 00:05:23.207
physicists have purported to give

00:05:23.207 --> 00:05:26.327
a purely scientific explanation of how

00:05:26.327 --> 00:05:29.322
a universe like ours could have popped into existence

00:05:29.322 --> 00:05:31.201
out of sheer nothingness,

00:05:31.201 --> 00:05:34.281
a quantum fluctuation out of the void.

00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:36.339
Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists,

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.645
more recently Alex Vilenkin,

00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:40.378
and the whole thing has been popularized

00:05:40.378 --> 00:05:42.571
by another very fine physicist and friend of mine,

00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:45.103
Lawrence Krauss, who wrote a book called

00:05:45.103 --> 00:05:47.229
"A Universe from Nothing,"

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.445
and Lawrence thinks that he's given —

00:05:49.445 --> 00:05:51.526
he's a militant atheist, by the way,

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:53.150
so he's gotten God out of the picture.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.531
The laws of quantum field theory,

00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:57.432
the state-of-the-art physics, can show how

00:05:57.432 --> 00:05:58.750
out of sheer nothingness,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.975
no space, no time, no matter, nothing,

00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:04.420
a little nugget of false vacuum

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.393
can fluctuate into existence,

00:06:06.393 --> 00:06:08.375
and then, by the miracle of inflation,

00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:11.460
blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.215
we see around us.

00:06:13.215 --> 00:06:16.769
Okay, this is a really ingenious scenario.

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:19.537
It's very speculative. It's fascinating.

00:06:19.537 --> 00:06:21.865
But I've got a big problem with it,

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:23.750
and the problem is this:

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.221
It's a pseudo-religious point of view.

00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:27.217
Now, Lawrence thinks he's an atheist,

00:06:27.217 --> 00:06:29.965
but he's still in thrall to a religious worldview.

00:06:29.965 --> 00:06:34.734
He sees physical laws as being like divine commands.

00:06:34.734 --> 00:06:36.784
The laws of quantum field theory for him

00:06:36.784 --> 00:06:39.395
are like fiat lux, "Let there be light."

00:06:39.395 --> 00:06:43.834
The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout

00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:45.941
that they can form the abyss,

00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:47.781
that it's pregnant with being.

00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:50.688
They can call a world into existence out of nothing.

00:06:50.688 --> 00:06:52.635
But that's a very primitive view of what

00:06:52.635 --> 00:06:54.108
a physical law is, right?

00:06:54.108 --> 00:06:57.363
We know that physical laws are actually

00:06:57.363 --> 00:07:00.407
generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities

00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:01.612
in the world.

00:07:01.612 --> 00:07:03.985
They don't exist outside the world.

00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:05.965
They don't have any ontic cloud of their own.

00:07:05.965 --> 00:07:07.960
They can't call a world into existence

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.278
out of nothingness.

00:07:09.278 --> 00:07:10.809
That's a very primitive view

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:12.993
of what a scientific law is.

00:07:12.993 --> 00:07:14.988
And if you don't believe me on this,

00:07:14.988 --> 00:07:16.790
listen to Stephen Hawking,

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.825
who himself put forward a model of the cosmos

00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:21.901
that was self-contained,

00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:25.539
didn't require any outside cause, any creator,

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:27.267
and after proposing this,

00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:29.681
Hawking admitted that he was still puzzled.

00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:32.993
He said, this model is just equations.

00:07:32.993 --> 00:07:35.852
What breathes fire into the equations

00:07:35.852 --> 00:07:38.774
and creates a world for them to describe?

00:07:38.774 --> 00:07:39.907
He was puzzled by this,

00:07:39.907 --> 00:07:43.712
so equations themselves can't do the magic,

00:07:43.712 --> 00:07:45.850
can't resolve the puzzle of existence.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.763
And besides, even if the laws could do that,

00:07:48.763 --> 00:07:50.586
why this set of laws?

00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:53.150
Why quantum field theory that describes

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.850
a universe with a certain number of forces

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:55.899
and particles and so forth?

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:58.190
Why not a completely different set of laws?

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.478
There are many, many mathematically
consistent sets of laws.

00:08:01.478 --> 00:08:04.917
Why not no laws at all? Why not sheer nothingness?

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.649
So this is a problem, believe it or not,

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:09.647
that reflective physicists really think a lot about,

00:08:09.647 --> 00:08:12.755
and at this point they tend to go metaphysical,

00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:14.970
say, well, maybe the set of laws

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.217
that describes our universe,

00:08:16.217 --> 00:08:17.952
it's just one set of laws

00:08:17.952 --> 00:08:19.988
and it describes one part of reality,

00:08:19.988 --> 00:08:22.784
but maybe every consistent set of laws

00:08:22.784 --> 00:08:24.570
describes another part of reality,

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:28.503
and in fact all possible physical worlds

00:08:28.503 --> 00:08:30.954
really exist, they're all out there.

00:08:30.954 --> 00:08:33.237
We just see a little tiny part of reality

00:08:33.237 --> 00:08:35.780
that's described by the laws of quantum field theory,

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.512
but there are many, many other worlds,

00:08:37.512 --> 00:08:39.278
parts of reality that are described

00:08:39.278 --> 00:08:41.235
by vastly different theories

00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:44.251
that are different from ours in ways we can't imagine,

00:08:44.251 --> 00:08:47.996
that are inconceivably exotic.

00:08:47.996 --> 00:08:49.733
Steven Weinberg, the father

00:08:49.733 --> 00:08:52.174
of the standard model of particle physics,

00:08:52.174 --> 00:08:55.000
has actually flirted with this idea himself,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.243
that all possible realities actually exist.

00:08:59.243 --> 00:09:02.332
Also, a younger physicist, Max Tegmark,

00:09:02.332 --> 00:09:06.708
who believes that all mathematical structures exist,

00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:08.845
and mathematical existence is the same thing

00:09:08.845 --> 00:09:10.612
as physical existence,

00:09:10.612 --> 00:09:12.930
so we have this vastly rich multiverse

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.371
that encompasses every logical possibility.

00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:19.881
Now, in taking this metaphysical way out,

00:09:19.881 --> 00:09:22.153
these physicists and also philosophers are actually

00:09:22.153 --> 00:09:24.675
reaching back to a very old idea

00:09:24.675 --> 00:09:26.132
that goes back to Plato.

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:29.330
It's the principle of plenitude or fecundity,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.243
or the great chain of being,

00:09:31.243 --> 00:09:35.110
that reality is actually as full as possible.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.811
It's as far removed from nothingness

00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:39.706
as it could possibly be.

00:09:39.706 --> 00:09:42.200
So we have these two extremes now.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.499
We have sheer nothingness on one side,

00:09:45.499 --> 00:09:47.997
and we have this vision of a reality

00:09:47.997 --> 00:09:51.180
that encompasses every conceivable world

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.909
at the other extreme: the fullest possible reality,

00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:56.802
nothingness, the simplest possible reality.

00:09:56.802 --> 00:09:59.681
Now what's in between these two extremes?

00:09:59.681 --> 00:10:01.708
There are all kinds of intermediate realities

00:10:01.708 --> 00:10:04.655
that include some things and leave out others.

00:10:04.655 --> 00:10:06.251
So one of these intermediate realities

00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:11.946
is, say, the most mathematically elegant reality,

00:10:11.946 --> 00:10:13.621
that leaves out the inelegant bits,

00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:16.267
the ugly asymmetries and so forth.

00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:18.593
Now, there are some physicists who will tell you

00:10:18.593 --> 00:10:22.227
that we're actually living in the most elegant reality.

00:10:22.227 --> 00:10:25.174
I think that Brian Greene is in the audience,

00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:28.787
and he has written a book
called "The Elegant Universe."

00:10:28.787 --> 00:10:31.058
He claims that the universe we live in mathematically

00:10:31.058 --> 00:10:32.767
is very elegant.

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:34.450
Don't believe him. (Laughter)

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.537
It's a pious hope, I wish it were true,

00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:39.450
but I think the other day he admitted to me

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.514
it's really an ugly universe.

00:10:42.514 --> 00:10:43.890
It's stupidly constructed,

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.144
it's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants

00:10:47.144 --> 00:10:48.810
and mass ratios

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.588
and superfluous families of elementary particles,

00:10:51.588 --> 00:10:53.736
and what the hell is dark energy?

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:57.135
It's a stick and bubble gum contraption.

00:10:57.135 --> 00:11:01.138
It's not an elegant universe. (Laughter)

00:11:01.138 --> 00:11:03.881
And then there's the best of all possible worlds

00:11:03.881 --> 00:11:05.471
in an ethical sense.

00:11:05.471 --> 00:11:06.650
You should get solemn now,

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.845
because a world in which sentient beings

00:11:09.845 --> 00:11:11.465
don't suffer needlessly,

00:11:11.465 --> 00:11:13.334
in which there aren't things like

00:11:13.334 --> 00:11:15.549
childhood cancer or the Holocaust.

00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:16.800
This is an ethical conception.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.865
Anyway, so between nothingness

00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:20.498
and the fullest possible reality,

00:11:20.498 --> 00:11:22.043
various special realities.

00:11:22.043 --> 00:11:24.323
Nothingness is special. It's the simplest.

00:11:24.323 --> 00:11:27.833
Then there's the most elegant possible reality.

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:29.197
That's special.

00:11:29.197 --> 00:11:31.849
The fullest possible reality, that's special.

00:11:31.849 --> 00:11:33.365
But what are we leaving out here?

00:11:33.365 --> 00:11:36.101
There's also just the crummy,

00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:37.856
generic realities

00:11:37.856 --> 00:11:40.477
that aren't special in any way,

00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:42.029
that are sort of random.

00:11:42.029 --> 00:11:44.756
They're infinitely removed from nothingness,

00:11:44.756 --> 00:11:48.682
but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness.

00:11:48.682 --> 00:11:51.202
They're a mixture of chaos and order,

00:11:51.202 --> 00:11:55.400
of mathematical elegance and ugliness.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.185
So I would describe these realities

00:11:57.185 --> 00:12:01.312
as an infinite, mediocre, incomplete mess,

00:12:01.312 --> 00:12:04.692
a generic reality, a kind of cosmic junk shot.

00:12:04.692 --> 00:12:06.876
And these realities,

00:12:06.876 --> 00:12:09.142
is there a deity in any of these realities?

00:12:09.142 --> 00:12:11.553
Maybe, but the deity isn't perfect

00:12:11.553 --> 00:12:13.889
like the Judeo-Christian deity.

00:12:13.889 --> 00:12:17.196
The deity isn't all-good and all-powerful.

00:12:17.196 --> 00:12:20.527
It might be instead 100 percent malevolent

00:12:20.527 --> 00:12:22.630
but only 80 percent effective,

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:28.767
which pretty much describes the world
we see around us, I think. (Laughter)

00:12:28.767 --> 00:12:31.499
So I would like to propose that the resolution

00:12:31.499 --> 00:12:33.335
to the mystery of existence

00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:37.425
is that the reality we exist in

00:12:37.425 --> 00:12:39.481
is one of these generic realities.

00:12:39.481 --> 00:12:42.136
Reality has to turn out some way.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.206
It can either turn out to be nothing

00:12:44.206 --> 00:12:47.887
or everything or something in between.

00:12:47.887 --> 00:12:51.578
So if it has some special feature,

00:12:51.578 --> 00:12:53.768
like being really elegant or really full

00:12:53.768 --> 00:12:55.376
or really simple, like nothingness,

00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:57.177
that would require an explanation.

00:12:57.177 --> 00:13:00.336
But if it's just one of these random, generic realities,

00:13:00.336 --> 00:13:02.486
there's no further explanation for it.

00:13:02.486 --> 00:13:03.870
And indeed, I would say

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.850
that's the reality we live in.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.107
That's what science is telling us.

00:13:08.107 --> 00:13:09.438
At the beginning of the week,

00:13:09.438 --> 00:13:12.554
we got the exciting information that

00:13:12.554 --> 00:13:15.693
the theory of inflation, which predicts a big,

00:13:15.693 --> 00:13:19.663
infinite, messy, arbitrary, pointless reality,

00:13:19.663 --> 00:13:23.488
it's like a big frothing champagne

00:13:23.488 --> 00:13:26.172
coming out of a bottle endlessly,

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.264
a vast universe, mostly a wasteland

00:13:28.264 --> 00:13:32.530
with little pockets of charm and order and peace,

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.895
this has been confirmed,

00:13:34.895 --> 00:13:37.797
this inflationary scenario, by the observations

00:13:37.797 --> 00:13:39.890
made by radio telescopes in Antarctica

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.713
that looked at the signature of the gravitational waves

00:13:42.713 --> 00:13:44.637
from just before the Big Bang.

00:13:44.637 --> 00:13:46.482
I'm sure you all know about this.

00:13:46.482 --> 00:13:49.306
So anyway, I think there's some evidence

00:13:49.306 --> 00:13:52.793
that this really is the reality that we're stuck with.

00:13:52.793 --> 00:13:55.900
Now, why should you care?

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.136
Well — (Laughter) —

00:13:57.136 --> 00:14:00.560
the question, "Why does the world exist?"

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.239
that's the cosmic question, it sort of rhymes

00:14:02.239 --> 00:14:03.693
with a more intimate question:

00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:06.776
Why do I exist? Why do you exist?

00:14:06.776 --> 00:14:10.376
you know, our existence would
seem to be amazingly improbable,

00:14:10.376 --> 00:14:14.695
because there's an enormous number
of genetically possible humans,

00:14:14.695 --> 00:14:16.099
if you can compute it by looking at

00:14:16.099 --> 00:14:18.441
the number of the genes and the
number of alleles and so forth,

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.737
and a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you

00:14:20.737 --> 00:14:22.892
there are about 10 to the 10,000th

00:14:22.892 --> 00:14:24.552
possible humans, genetically.

00:14:24.552 --> 00:14:28.020
That's between a googol and a googolplex.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.636
And the number of the actual
humans that have existed

00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:32.130
is 100 billion, maybe 50 billion,

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.195
an infinitesimal fraction, so all of us,

00:14:34.195 --> 00:14:36.125
we've won this amazing cosmic lottery.

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.244
We're here. Okay.

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:41.165
So what kind of reality do we want to live in?

00:14:41.165 --> 00:14:43.415
Do we want to live in a special reality?

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:47.644
What if we were living in the
most elegant possible reality?

00:14:47.644 --> 00:14:50.153
Imagine the existential pressure on us

00:14:50.153 --> 00:14:51.992
to live up to that, to be elegant,

00:14:51.992 --> 00:14:53.858
not to pull down the tone of it.

00:14:53.858 --> 00:14:56.939
Or, what if we were living
in the fullest possible reality?

00:14:56.939 --> 00:14:58.950
Well then our existence would be guaranteed,

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.728
because every possible thing

00:15:00.728 --> 00:15:02.094
exists in that reality,

00:15:02.094 --> 00:15:04.255
but our choices would be meaningless.

00:15:04.255 --> 00:15:07.250
If I really struggle morally and agonize

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.330
and I decide to do the right thing,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.525
what difference does it make,

00:15:10.525 --> 00:15:12.550
because there are an infinite number

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.564
of versions of me

00:15:13.564 --> 00:15:14.961
also doing the right thing

00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:16.616
and an infinite number doing the wrong thing.

00:15:16.616 --> 00:15:18.456
So my choices are meaningless.

00:15:18.456 --> 00:15:20.740
So we don't want to live in that special reality.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.327
And as for the special reality of nothingness,

00:15:23.327 --> 00:15:25.554
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

00:15:25.554 --> 00:15:32.489
So I think living in a generic reality that's mediocre,

00:15:32.489 --> 00:15:34.385
there are nasty bits and nice bits

00:15:34.385 --> 00:15:35.927
and we could make the nice bits bigger

00:15:35.927 --> 00:15:38.266
and the nasty bits smaller

00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:41.157
and that gives us a kind of purpose in life.

00:15:41.157 --> 00:15:42.563
The universe is absurd,

00:15:42.563 --> 00:15:44.290
but we can still construct a purpose,

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:45.230
and that's a pretty good one,

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.895
and the overall mediocrity of reality

00:15:47.895 --> 00:15:50.500
kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.812
we all feel in the core of our being.

00:15:52.812 --> 00:15:54.446
And I know you feel it.

00:15:54.446 --> 00:15:55.550
I know you're all special,

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.872
but you're still kind of secretly mediocre,

00:15:57.872 --> 00:15:59.261
don't you think?

00:15:59.261 --> 00:16:01.198
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:16:01.198 --> 00:16:05.250
So anyway, you may say, this 
puzzle, the mystery of existence,

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.668
it's just silly mystery-mongering.

00:16:06.668 --> 00:16:10.535
You're not astonished at the existence of the universe

00:16:10.535 --> 00:16:12.170
and you're in good company.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.386
Bertrand Russell said,

00:16:14.386 --> 00:16:18.041
"I should say the universe is just there, and that's all."

00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:19.442
Just a brute fact.

00:16:19.442 --> 00:16:22.276
And my professor at Columbia, Sidney Morgenbesser,

00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:23.985
a great philosophical wag,

00:16:23.985 --> 00:16:25.602
when I said to him, "Professor Morgenbesser,

00:16:25.602 --> 00:16:28.098
why is there something rather than nothing?"

00:16:28.098 --> 00:16:30.248
And he said, "Oh, even if there was nothing,

00:16:30.248 --> 00:16:32.244
you still wouldn't be satisfied."

00:16:32.244 --> 00:16:35.993
So — (Laughter) — okay.

00:16:35.993 --> 00:16:38.355
So you're not astonished. I don't care.

00:16:38.355 --> 00:16:41.328
But I will tell you something to conclude

00:16:41.328 --> 00:16:43.606
that I guarantee you will astonish you,

00:16:43.606 --> 00:16:46.273
because it's astonished all of the brilliant,

00:16:46.273 --> 00:16:48.586
wonderful people I've met at this TED conference,

00:16:48.586 --> 00:16:50.800
when I've told them, and it's this:

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.302
Never in my life have I had a cell phone.
