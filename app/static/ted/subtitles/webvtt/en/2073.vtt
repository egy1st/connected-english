00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.374
So recently,

00:00:02.374 --> 00:00:05.176
some white guys and some black women

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:07.808
swapped Twitter avatars, or pictures online.

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:09.093
They didn't change their content,

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:10.904
they kept tweeting the same as usual,

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:13.702
but suddenly, the white guys noticed

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:15.603
they were getting called the n-word all the time

00:00:15.603 --> 00:00:18.331
and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse,

00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:20.891
whereas the black women all of a sudden

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.962
noticed things got a lot more pleasant for them.

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:25.897
Now, if you're my five-year-old,

00:00:25.897 --> 00:00:29.130
your Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.285
and occasionally fairies riding puppies.

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:34.030
That's a thing. Google it.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.324
But the rest of us know that the Internet

00:00:36.324 --> 00:00:39.182
can be a really ugly place.

00:00:39.182 --> 00:00:42.157
I'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates

00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:44.445
that I think are healthy for our democracy.

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:47.823
I'm talking about nasty personal attacks.

00:00:47.823 --> 00:00:49.947
Maybe it's happened to you, but it's at least

00:00:49.947 --> 00:00:52.738
twice as likely to happen, and be worse,

00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:54.741
if you're a woman, a person of color, or gay,

00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:56.675
or more than one at the same time.

00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:59.364
In fact, just as I was writing this talk,

00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:02.363
I found a Twitter account called @SallyKohnSucks.

00:01:04.343 --> 00:01:07.215
The bio says that I'm a

00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:10.724
"man-hater and a bull dyke and the only
thing I've ever accomplished with my career

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:13.289
is spreading my perverse sexuality."

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.466
Which, incidentally, is only a third correct.

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:19.116
I mean, lies! (Laughter)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.113
But seriously, we all say we hate this crap.

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:24.930
The question is whether you're willing to make

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.118
a personal sacrifice to change it.

00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:29.980
I don't mean giving up the Internet.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.182
I mean changing the way you click,

00:01:32.182 --> 00:01:35.037
because clicking is a public act.

00:01:35.037 --> 00:01:36.710
It's no longer the case

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.121
that a few powerful elites control all the media

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:41.360
and the rest of us are just passive receivers.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.172
Increasingly, we're all the media.

00:01:44.172 --> 00:01:47.332
I used to think, oh, okay, I get dressed up,

00:01:47.332 --> 00:01:49.238
I put on a lot of makeup,

00:01:49.238 --> 00:01:51.116
I go on television, I talk about the news.

00:01:51.116 --> 00:01:54.457
That is a public act of making media.

00:01:54.457 --> 00:01:56.516
And then I go home and I browse the web

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:57.652
and I'm reading Twitter,

00:01:57.652 --> 00:01:59.769
and that's a private act of consuming media.

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:02.326
I mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas.

00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:04.152
Wrong.

00:02:04.152 --> 00:02:06.266
Everything we blog, everything we Tweet,

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:09.621
and everything we click

00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:12.937
is a public act of making media.

00:02:12.937 --> 00:02:14.481
We are the new editors.

00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:16.313
We decide what gets attention

00:02:16.313 --> 00:02:19.110
based on what we give our attention to.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.457
That's how the media works now.

00:02:20.457 --> 00:02:22.870
There's all these hidden algorithms that decide

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.133
what you see more of and what we all see more of

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:26.890
based on what you click on,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.956
and that in turn shapes our whole culture.

00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:32.911
Over three out of five Americans think we have

00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:36.901
a major incivility problem in our country right now,

00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:38.635
but I'm going to guess that at least three out of five

00:02:38.635 --> 00:02:42.655
Americans are clicking on the same insult-oriented,

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:44.803
rumor-mongering trash that feeds

00:02:44.803 --> 00:02:47.860
the nastiest impulses in our society.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.833
In an increasingly noisy media landscape,

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:55.213
the incentive is to make more noise to be heard,

00:02:55.213 --> 00:02:58.140
and that tyranny of the loud

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.477
encourages the tyranny of the nasty.

00:03:01.477 --> 00:03:04.395
It does not have to be that way.

00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:05.957
It does not.

00:03:05.957 --> 00:03:08.832
We can change the incentive.

00:03:08.832 --> 00:03:10.452
For starters, there are two things we can all do.

00:03:10.452 --> 00:03:14.385
First, don't just stand by the sidelines
when you see someone getting hurt.

00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:18.065
If someone is being abused online, do something.

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.194
Be a hero. This is your chance.

00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:22.545
Speak up. Speak out. Be a good person.

00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:24.841
Drown out the negative with the positive.

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:28.230
And second, we've got to stop clicking

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.633
on the lowest-common-denominator, bottom-feeding

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:31.999
linkbait.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:35.571
If you don't like the 24/7 all Kardashian

00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:37.253
all the time programming,

00:03:37.253 --> 00:03:39.127
you've got to stop clicking on the stories

00:03:39.127 --> 00:03:43.070
about Kim Kardashian's sideboob.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.874
I know you do it. (Applause)

00:03:45.874 --> 00:03:47.814
You too, apparently.

00:03:47.814 --> 00:03:48.939
I mean, really, same example:

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.436
if you don't like politicians calling each other names,

00:03:51.436 --> 00:03:53.147
stop clicking on the stories

00:03:53.147 --> 00:03:56.207
about what one guy in one party called
the other guy in the other party.

00:03:56.207 --> 00:03:58.998
Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it.

00:03:58.998 --> 00:04:00.920
It makes it worse, the fire spreads.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.917
Our whole culture gets burned.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:08.050
If what gets the most clicks wins,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.921
then we have to start shaping the world we want

00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:12.890
with our clicks,

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.776
because clicking is a public act.

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:19.256
So click responsibly. Thank you.

00:04:19.256 --> 00:04:23.256
(Applause)
