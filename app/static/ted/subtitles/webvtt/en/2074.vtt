00:00:00.937 --> 00:00:02.633
This is a photograph

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:05.449
of a man whom for many years

00:00:05.449 --> 00:00:09.170
I plotted to kill.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.190
This is my father,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.927
Clinton George "Bageye" Grant.

00:00:15.927 --> 00:00:18.198
He's called Bageye because he has

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:22.358
permanent bags under his eyes.

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:25.134
As a 10-year-old, along with my siblings,

00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:29.250
I dreamt of scraping off the poison

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.200
from fly-killer paper into his coffee,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.055
grounded down glass and sprinkling it

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:38.044
over his breakfast,

00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:39.754
loosening the carpet on the stairs

00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:43.482
so he would trip and break his neck.

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:45.109
But come the day, he would always

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.361
skip that loose step,

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:49.190
he would always bow out of the house

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.030
without so much as a swig of coffee

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.818
or a bite to eat.

00:00:53.818 --> 00:00:55.104
And so for many years,

00:00:55.104 --> 00:00:57.064
I feared that my father would die

00:00:57.064 --> 00:00:59.138
before I had a chance to kill him.

00:00:59.138 --> 00:01:03.730
(Laughter)

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.721
Up until our mother asked him to leave

00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.378
and not come back,

00:01:08.378 --> 00:01:12.634
Bageye had been a terrifying ogre.

00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:16.219
He teetered permanently on the verge of rage,

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.827
rather like me, as you see.

00:01:19.827 --> 00:01:23.127
He worked nights at Vauxhall Motors in Luton

00:01:23.127 --> 00:01:26.286
and demanded total silence throughout the house,

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.958
so that when we came home from school

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.998
at 3:30 in the afternoon, we would huddle

00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:34.248
beside the TV, and rather like safe-crackers,

00:01:34.248 --> 00:01:36.734
we would twiddle with the volume control knob

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:39.527
on the TV so it was almost inaudible.

00:01:39.527 --> 00:01:41.838
And at times, when we were like this,

00:01:41.838 --> 00:01:44.270
so much "Shhh," so much "Shhh"

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.135
going on in the house

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:48.110
that I imagined us to be like

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.610
the German crew of a U-boat

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.102
creeping along the edge of the ocean

00:01:54.102 --> 00:01:55.918
whilst up above, on the surface,

00:01:55.918 --> 00:01:59.663
HMS Bageye patrolled

00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:01.790
ready to drop death charges

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.777
at the first sound of any disturbance.

00:02:05.777 --> 00:02:08.712
So that lesson was the lesson that

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:10.160
"Do not draw attention to yourself

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.424
either in the home or outside of the home."

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:15.110
Maybe it's a migrant lesson.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.280
We were to be below the radar,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.775
so there was no communication, really,

00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:22.936
between Bageye and us and us and Bageye,

00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:25.544
and the sound that we most looked forward to,

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.298
you know when you're a child and you want

00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:30.736
your father to come home
and it's all going to be happy

00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:32.490
and you're waiting for that sound of the door opening.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.746
Well the sound that we looked forward to

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:35.639
was the click of the door closing,

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.347
which meant he'd gone and would not come back.

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:43.806
So for three decades,

00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:46.847
I never laid eyes on my father, nor he on me.

00:02:46.847 --> 00:02:48.615
We never spoke to each other for three decades,

00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:50.416
and then a couple of years ago, I decided

00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:54.687
to turn the spotlight on him.

00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:56.575
"You are being watched.

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:58.431
Actually, you are.

00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:00.495
You are being watched."

00:03:00.495 --> 00:03:03.159
That was his mantra to us, his children.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.832
Time and time again he would say this to us.

00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:07.935
And this was the 1970s, it was Luton,

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:09.564
where he worked at Vauxhall Motors,

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.391
and he was a Jamaican.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.450
And what he meant was,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.561
you as a child of a Jamaican immigrant

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.479
are being watched

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.136
to see which way you turn, to see whether

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:22.255
you conform to the host nation's stereotype of you,

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:24.855
of being feckless, work-shy,

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:27.416
destined for a life of crime.

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:29.150
You are being watched,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.493
so confound their expectations of you.

00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:37.771
To that end, Bageye and his friends,

00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:39.426
mostly Jamaican,

00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:43.180
exhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura:

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.794
Turn your best side to the world,

00:03:45.794 --> 00:03:48.068
show your best face to the world.

00:03:48.068 --> 00:03:49.842
If you have seen some of the images

00:03:49.842 --> 00:03:51.978
of the Caribbean people arriving

00:03:51.978 --> 00:03:53.630
in the '40s and '50s,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.026
you might have noticed that a lot of the men

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.915
wear trilbies.

00:03:56.915 --> 00:04:00.556
Now, there was no tradition
of wearing trilbies in Jamaica.

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:03.499
They invented that tradition for their arrival here.

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:05.266
They wanted to project themselves in a way

00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:07.600
that they wanted to be perceived,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.031
so that the way they looked

00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:11.974
and the names that they gave themselves

00:04:11.974 --> 00:04:13.646
defined them.

00:04:13.646 --> 00:04:19.135
So Bageye is bald and has baggy eyes.

00:04:19.135 --> 00:04:23.147
Tidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear.

00:04:23.147 --> 00:04:25.859
Anxious is always anxious.

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:28.588
Clock has one arm longer than the other.

00:04:28.588 --> 00:04:32.236
(Laughter)

00:04:32.236 --> 00:04:35.610
And my all-time favorite was the
guy they called Summerwear.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.444
When Summerwear came to this country

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.563
from Jamaica in the early '60s, he insisted

00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:41.940
on wearing light summer suits,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.596
no matter the weather,

00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:44.934
and in the course of researching their lives,

00:04:44.934 --> 00:04:47.910
I asked my mom, "Whatever
became of Summerwear?"

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.737
And she said, "He caught a cold and died." (Laughter)

00:04:52.737 --> 00:04:54.593
But men like Summerwear

00:04:54.593 --> 00:04:56.055
taught us the importance of style.

00:04:56.055 --> 00:04:58.177
Maybe they exaggerated their style

00:04:58.177 --> 00:05:01.393
because they thought that they were not considered

00:05:01.393 --> 00:05:03.497
to be quite civilized,

00:05:03.497 --> 00:05:06.313
and they transferred that generational attitude

00:05:06.313 --> 00:05:08.913
or anxiety onto us, the next generation,

00:05:08.913 --> 00:05:11.100
so much so that when I was growing up,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.473
if ever on the television news or radio

00:05:13.473 --> 00:05:14.981
a report came up about a black person

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.665
committing some crime —

00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:20.329
a mugging, a murder, a burglary —

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:23.881
we winced along with our parents,

00:05:23.881 --> 00:05:26.545
because they were letting the side down.

00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:27.998
You did not just represent yourself.

00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:29.740
You represented the group,

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.248
and it was a terrifying thing to come to terms with,

00:05:34.248 --> 00:05:36.512
in a way, that maybe you were going

00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:40.656
to be perceived in the same light.

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:44.428
So that was what needed to be challenged.

00:05:44.428 --> 00:05:48.709
Our father and many of his colleagues

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:52.170
exhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.392
They were built to transmit but not receive.

00:05:54.392 --> 00:05:57.243
We were to keep quiet.

00:05:57.243 --> 00:05:58.596
When our father did speak to us,

00:05:58.596 --> 00:06:01.461
it was from the pulpit of his mind.

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:03.049
They clung to certainty in the belief

00:06:03.049 --> 00:06:07.178
that doubt would undermine them.

00:06:07.178 --> 00:06:10.769
But when I am working in my house

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:14.620
and writing, after a day's writing, I rush downstairs

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.926
and I'm very excited to talk about
Marcus Garvey or Bob Marley

00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:20.790
and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.286
and I'm so excited that my children stop me,

00:06:23.286 --> 00:06:26.966
and they say, "Dad, nobody cares."

00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:30.956
(Laughter)

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:32.870
But they do care, actually.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.433
They cross over.

00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:36.940
Somehow they find their way to you.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.544
They shape their lives according
to the narrative of your life,

00:06:40.544 --> 00:06:44.570
as I did with my father and my mother, perhaps,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.184
and maybe Bageye did with his father.

00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:48.826
And that was clearer to me

00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:51.784
in the course of looking at his life

00:06:51.784 --> 00:06:54.840
and understanding, as they say,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.152
the Native Americans say,

00:06:56.152 --> 00:06:57.781
"Do not criticize the man until you can walk

00:06:57.781 --> 00:07:00.093
in his moccasins."

00:07:00.093 --> 00:07:02.992
But in conjuring his life, it was okay

00:07:02.992 --> 00:07:06.260
and very straightforward to portray

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.240
a Caribbean life in England in the 1970s

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.224
with bowls of plastic fruit,

00:07:14.224 --> 00:07:17.288
polystyrene ceiling tiles,

00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:19.576
settees permanently sheathed

00:07:19.576 --> 00:07:22.948
in their transparent covers
that they were delivered in.

00:07:22.948 --> 00:07:24.800
But what's more difficult to navigate

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.292
is the emotional landscape

00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:28.262
between the generations,

00:07:28.262 --> 00:07:33.000
and the old adage that with age comes wisdom

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.045
is not true.

00:07:35.045 --> 00:07:38.528
With age comes the veneer of respectability

00:07:38.528 --> 00:07:41.896
and a veneer of uncomfortable truths.

00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:44.668
But what was true was that my parents,

00:07:44.668 --> 00:07:47.144
my mother, and my father went along with it,

00:07:47.144 --> 00:07:49.912
did not trust the state to educate me.

00:07:49.912 --> 00:07:52.402
So listen to how I sound.

00:07:52.402 --> 00:07:56.684
They determined that they would
send me to a private school,

00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:58.441
but my father worked at Vauxhall Motors.

00:07:58.441 --> 00:08:02.232
It's quite difficult to fund a private school education

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.872
and feed his army of children.

00:08:04.872 --> 00:08:06.856
I remember going on to the school

00:08:06.856 --> 00:08:08.980
for the entrance exam, and my father said

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.580
to the priest — it was a Catholic school —

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.807
he wanted a better "heducation" for the boy,

00:08:16.807 --> 00:08:19.735
but also, he, my father,

00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:22.375
never even managed to pass worms,

00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:24.995
never mind entrance exams.

00:08:24.995 --> 00:08:26.940
But in order to fund my education,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.663
he was going to have to do some dodgy stuff,

00:08:29.663 --> 00:08:32.765
so my father would fund my education

00:08:32.765 --> 00:08:36.369
by trading in illicit goods from the back of his car,

00:08:36.369 --> 00:08:37.801
and that was made even more tricky because

00:08:37.801 --> 00:08:39.961
my father, that's not his car by the way.

00:08:39.961 --> 00:08:41.769
My father aspired to have a car like that,

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:43.845
but my father had a beaten-up Mini,

00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:48.343
and he never, being a
Jamaican coming to this country,

00:08:48.343 --> 00:08:50.696
he never had a driving license,

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:54.260
he never had any insurance or road tax or MOT.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.199
He thought, "I know how to drive;

00:08:56.199 --> 00:08:59.279
why do I need the state's validation?"

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.511
But it became a little tricky when
we were stopped by the police,

00:09:01.511 --> 00:09:03.724
and we were stopped a lot by the police,

00:09:03.724 --> 00:09:04.941
and I was impressed by the way

00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:06.840
that my father dealt with the police.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.648
He would promote the policeman immediately,

00:09:09.648 --> 00:09:13.735
so that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs

00:09:13.735 --> 00:09:14.919
in the course of the conversation

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:16.903
and wave us on merrily.

00:09:16.903 --> 00:09:18.771
So my father was exhibiting what we in Jamaica

00:09:18.771 --> 00:09:22.953
called "playing fool to catch wise."

00:09:22.953 --> 00:09:26.322
But it lent also an idea

00:09:26.322 --> 00:09:28.128
that actually he was being diminished

00:09:28.128 --> 00:09:30.432
or belittled by the policeman —

00:09:30.432 --> 00:09:32.249
as a 10-year-old boy, I saw that —

00:09:32.249 --> 00:09:34.820
but also there was an ambivalence towards authority.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.465
So on the one hand, there was

00:09:36.465 --> 00:09:38.092
a mocking of authority,

00:09:38.092 --> 00:09:40.408
but on the other hand, there was a deference

00:09:40.408 --> 00:09:42.229
towards authority,

00:09:42.229 --> 00:09:44.184
and these Caribbean people

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:48.321
had an overbearing obedience towards authority,

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:50.529
which is very striking, very strange in a way,

00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:53.633
because migrants are very courageous people.

00:09:53.633 --> 00:09:56.393
They leave their homes. My father and my mother

00:09:56.393 --> 00:10:00.320
left Jamaica and they traveled 4,000 miles,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.144
and yet they were infantilized by travel.

00:10:04.144 --> 00:10:05.912
They were timid,

00:10:05.912 --> 00:10:07.361
and somewhere along the line,

00:10:07.361 --> 00:10:09.202
the natural order was reversed.

00:10:09.202 --> 00:10:12.689
The children became the parents to the parent.

00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:17.143
The Caribbean people came to
this country with a five-year plan:

00:10:17.143 --> 00:10:19.142
they would work, some money, and then go back,

00:10:19.142 --> 00:10:21.965
but the five years became 10, the 10 became 15,

00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:24.310
and before you know it,
you're changing the wallpaper,

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.942
and at that point, you know you're here to stay.

00:10:27.942 --> 00:10:30.406
Although there's still the kind of temporariness

00:10:30.406 --> 00:10:32.853
that our parents felt about being here,

00:10:32.853 --> 00:10:37.040
but we children knew that the game was up.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.798
I think there was a feeling that

00:10:39.798 --> 00:10:45.148
they would not be able to continue with the ideals

00:10:45.148 --> 00:10:47.155
of the life that they expected.

00:10:47.155 --> 00:10:49.137
The reality was very much different.

00:10:49.137 --> 00:10:51.211
And also, that was true of the reality

00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:52.629
of trying to educate me.

00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:56.691
Having started the process,
my father did not continue.

00:10:56.691 --> 00:10:59.419
It was left to my mother to educate me,

00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:02.140
and as George Lamming would say,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.919
it was my mother who fathered me.

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:08.261
Even in his absence, that old mantra remained:

00:11:08.261 --> 00:11:09.948
You are being watched.

00:11:09.948 --> 00:11:13.150
But such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.399
so much so that years later, when I was investigating

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.713
why so many young black men

00:11:16.713 --> 00:11:18.844
were diagnosed with schizophrenia,

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:21.351
six times more than they ought to be,

00:11:21.351 --> 00:11:24.623
I was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say,

00:11:24.623 --> 00:11:29.081
"Black people are schooled in paranoia."

00:11:29.081 --> 00:11:32.952
And I wonder what Bageye would make of that.

00:11:32.952 --> 00:11:35.479
Now I also had a 10-year-old son,

00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:38.328
and turned my attention to Bageye

00:11:38.328 --> 00:11:39.704
and I went in search of him.

00:11:39.704 --> 00:11:43.306
He was back in Luton, he was now 82,

00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:46.946
and I hadn't seen him for 30-odd years,

00:11:46.946 --> 00:11:48.544
and when he opened the door,

00:11:48.544 --> 00:11:52.448
I saw this tiny little man with lambent, smiling eyes,

00:11:52.448 --> 00:11:54.791
and he was smiling, and I'd never seen him smile.

00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:57.839
I was very disconcerted by that.

00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:00.900
But we sat down, and he had
a Caribbean friend with him,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.455
talking some old time talk,

00:12:03.455 --> 00:12:05.929
and my father would look at me,

00:12:05.929 --> 00:12:07.583
and he looked at me as if I would

00:12:07.583 --> 00:12:11.227
miraculously disappear as I had arisen.

00:12:11.227 --> 00:12:13.463
And he turned to his friend, and he said,

00:12:13.463 --> 00:12:16.423
"This boy and me have a deep, deep connection,

00:12:16.423 --> 00:12:19.383
deep, deep connection."

00:12:19.383 --> 00:12:20.780
But I never felt that connection.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.559
If there was a pulse, it was very weak

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:26.383
or hardly at all.

00:12:26.383 --> 00:12:28.223
And I almost felt in the course of that reunion

00:12:28.223 --> 00:12:32.840
that I was auditioning to be my father's son.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.832
When the book came out,

00:12:34.832 --> 00:12:36.568
it had fair reviews in the national papers,

00:12:36.568 --> 00:12:39.840
but the paper of choice in Luton is not The Guardian,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.127
it's the Luton News,

00:12:42.127 --> 00:12:45.903
and the Luton News ran the headline about the book,

00:12:45.903 --> 00:12:51.122
"The Book That May Heal a 32-Year-Old Rift."

00:12:51.122 --> 00:12:54.434
And I understood that could also represent

00:12:54.434 --> 00:12:56.337
the rift between one generation and the next,

00:12:56.337 --> 00:13:00.341
between people like me and my father's generation,

00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:02.589
but there's no tradition in Caribbean life

00:13:02.589 --> 00:13:04.693
of memoirs or biographies.

00:13:04.693 --> 00:13:08.777
It was a tradition that you didn't
chat about your business in public.

00:13:08.777 --> 00:13:13.433
But I welcomed that title, and I thought actually, yes,

00:13:13.433 --> 00:13:15.329
there is a possibility that this

00:13:15.329 --> 00:13:19.522
will open up conversations
that we'd never had before.

00:13:19.522 --> 00:13:23.726
This will close the generation gap, perhaps.

00:13:23.726 --> 00:13:26.253
This could be an instrument of repair.

00:13:26.253 --> 00:13:28.654
And I even began to feel that this book

00:13:28.654 --> 00:13:31.542
may be perceived by my father

00:13:31.542 --> 00:13:35.718
as an act of filial devotion.

00:13:35.718 --> 00:13:39.453
Poor, deluded fool.

00:13:39.453 --> 00:13:43.494
Bageye was stung by what he perceived to be

00:13:43.494 --> 00:13:46.353
the public airing of his shortcomings.

00:13:46.353 --> 00:13:49.254
He was stung by my betrayal,

00:13:49.254 --> 00:13:51.326
and he went to the newspapers the next day

00:13:51.326 --> 00:13:52.510
and demanded a right of reply,

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.742
and he got it with the headline

00:13:54.742 --> 00:13:57.902
"Bageye Bites Back."

00:13:57.902 --> 00:14:00.870
And it was a coruscating account of my betrayal.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.748
I was no son of his.

00:14:03.748 --> 00:14:05.829
He recognized in his mind that his colors

00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:08.197
had been dragged through the
mud, and he couldn't allow that.

00:14:08.197 --> 00:14:10.782
He had to restore his dignity, and he did so,

00:14:10.782 --> 00:14:13.210
and initially, although I was disappointed,

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.890
I grew to admire that stance.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.293
There was still fire bubbling through his veins,

00:14:18.293 --> 00:14:21.910
even though he was 82 years old.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.472
And if it meant that we would now return

00:14:24.472 --> 00:14:27.703
to 30 years of silence,

00:14:27.703 --> 00:14:33.663
my father would say, "If it's so, then it's so."

00:14:33.663 --> 00:14:36.855
Jamaicans will tell you that
there's no such thing as facts,

00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:38.880
there are only versions.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.361
We all tell ourselves the versions of the story

00:14:41.361 --> 00:14:44.216
that we can best live with.

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:46.743
Each generation builds up an edifice

00:14:46.743 --> 00:14:48.810
which they are reluctant or sometimes unable

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.118
to disassemble,

00:14:51.118 --> 00:14:54.764
but in the writing, my version of the story

00:14:54.764 --> 00:14:56.832
began to change,

00:14:56.832 --> 00:15:00.826
and it was detached from me.

00:15:00.826 --> 00:15:03.755
I lost my hatred of my father.

00:15:03.755 --> 00:15:08.239
I did no longer want him to die or to murder him,

00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:12.483
and I felt free,

00:15:12.483 --> 00:15:17.347
much freer than I'd ever felt before.

00:15:17.347 --> 00:15:19.227
And I wonder whether that freedness

00:15:19.227 --> 00:15:22.142
could be transferred to him.

00:15:24.218 --> 00:15:28.570
In that initial reunion,

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.946
I was struck by an idea that I had

00:15:30.946 --> 00:15:34.390
very few photographs of myself

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.764
as a young child.

00:15:36.764 --> 00:15:38.954
This is a photograph of me,

00:15:38.954 --> 00:15:41.271
nine months old.

00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:43.193
In the original photograph,

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:46.146
I'm being held up by my father, Bageye,

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:48.390
but when my parents separated, my mother

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.160
excised him from all aspects of our lives.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.224
She took a pair of scissors and cut 
him out of every photograph,

00:15:55.224 --> 00:15:58.766
and for years, I told myself
the truth of this photograph

00:15:58.766 --> 00:16:01.770
was that you are alone,

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.570
you are unsupported.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.842
But there's another way of looking at this photograph.

00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:09.418
This is a photograph that has the potential

00:16:09.418 --> 00:16:11.922
for a reunion,

00:16:11.922 --> 00:16:14.710
a potential to be reunited with my father,

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.774
and in my yearning to be held up by my father,

00:16:18.774 --> 00:16:21.274
I held him up to the light.

00:16:21.274 --> 00:16:24.210
In that first reunion,

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.512
it was very awkward and tense moments,

00:16:26.512 --> 00:16:27.854
and to lessen the tension,

00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:31.192
we decided to go for a walk.

00:16:31.192 --> 00:16:33.193
And as we walked, I was struck

00:16:33.193 --> 00:16:35.464
that I had reverted to being the child

00:16:35.464 --> 00:16:38.957
even though I was now towering above my father.

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:41.208
I was almost a foot taller than my father.

00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:43.816
He was still the big man,

00:16:43.816 --> 00:16:48.537
and I tried to match his step.

00:16:48.537 --> 00:16:50.114
And I realized that he was walking

00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:52.890
as if he was still under observation,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.801
but I admired his walk.

00:16:55.801 --> 00:16:58.129
He walked like a man

00:16:58.129 --> 00:17:01.000
on the losing side of the F.A. Cup Final

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.952
mounting the steps to collect his condolence medal.

00:17:04.952 --> 00:17:08.576
There was dignity in defeat.

00:17:08.576 --> 00:17:10.993
Thank you.

00:17:10.993 --> 00:17:11.871
(Applause)
