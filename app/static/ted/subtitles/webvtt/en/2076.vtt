00:00:00.715 --> 00:00:02.464
For over a decade as a doctor,

00:00:02.464 --> 00:00:05.130
I've cared for homeless veterans,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.185
for working-class families.

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:11.406
I've cared for people who 
live and work in conditions

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:13.855
that can be hard, if not harsh,

00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:15.608
and that work has led me to believe

00:00:15.608 --> 00:00:17.553
that we need a fundamentally different way

00:00:17.553 --> 00:00:19.787
of looking at healthcare.

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:21.193
We simply need a healthcare system

00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:23.294
that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:24.973
that bring people into clinics,

00:00:24.973 --> 00:00:27.850
but instead actually is able to look

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.445
and improve health where it begins.

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:31.932
And where health begins

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:34.692
is not in the four walls of a doctor's office,

00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:36.102
but where we live

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.321
and where we work,

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:41.473
where we eat, sleep, learn and play,

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:44.900
where we spend the majority of our lives.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.568
So what does this different 
approach to healthcare look like,

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:50.794
an approach that can improve health where it begins?

00:00:50.794 --> 00:00:54.601
To illustrate this, I'll tell you about Veronica.

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:56.320
Veronica was the 17th patient

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.227
out of my 26-patient day

00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:01.174
at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles.

00:01:01.174 --> 00:01:03.693
She came into our clinic with a chronic headache.

00:01:03.693 --> 00:01:04.856
This headache had been going on

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.809
for a number of years, and this particular episode

00:01:06.809 --> 00:01:09.260
was very, very troubling.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.974
In fact, three weeks before she came to visit us

00:01:11.974 --> 00:01:15.130
for the first time, she went to an 
emergency room in Los Angeles.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.597
The emergency room doctors said,

00:01:17.597 --> 00:01:19.555
"We've run some tests, Veronica.

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:22.267
The results are normal, so
here's some pain medication,

00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:24.786
and follow up with a primary care doctor,

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:26.529
but if the pain persists or if it worsens,

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:28.258
then come on back."

00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:31.350
Veronica followed those standard instructions

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.100
and she went back.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.333
She went back not just once, but twice more.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.791
In the three weeks before Veronica met us,

00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:40.940
she went to the emergency room three times.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.807
She went back and forth,

00:01:42.807 --> 00:01:44.506
in and out of hospitals and clinics,

00:01:44.506 --> 00:01:46.272
just like she had done in years past,

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.712
trying to seek relief but still coming up short.

00:01:49.712 --> 00:01:51.840
Veronica came to our clinic,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.472
and despite all these encounters
with healthcare professionals,

00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:57.304
Veronica was still sick.

00:01:57.304 --> 00:02:00.925
When she came to our clinic, though, 
we tried a different approach.

00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:03.562
Our approach started with our medical assistant,

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:05.609
someone who had a GED-level training

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:06.959
but knew the community.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.080
Our medical assistant asked some routine questions.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.532
She asked, "What's your chief complaint?"

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:13.821
"Headache."

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:15.115
"Let's get your vital signs" —

00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:17.624
measure your blood pressure and your heart rate,

00:02:17.624 --> 00:02:19.637
but let's also ask something equally as vital

00:02:19.637 --> 00:02:21.707
to Veronica and a lot of patients like her

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:23.514
in South Los Angeles.

00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:26.155
"Veronica, can you tell me about where you live?

00:02:26.155 --> 00:02:27.908
Specifically, about your housing conditions?

00:02:27.908 --> 00:02:30.361
Do you have mold? Do you have water leaks?

00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.518
Do you have roaches in your home?"

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.925
Turns out, Veronica said yes
to three of those things:

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:37.232
roaches, water leaks, mold.

00:02:37.232 --> 00:02:40.347
I received that chart in hand, reviewed it,

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:41.674
and I turned the handle on the door

00:02:41.674 --> 00:02:43.666
and I entered the room.

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:45.116
You should understand that Veronica,

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:47.569
like a lot of patients that I have
the privilege of caring for,

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.292
is a dignified person, a formidable presence,

00:02:50.292 --> 00:02:52.125
a personality that's larger than life,

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:53.925
but here she was

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:56.760
doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.944
Her head, clearly throbbing, was resting in her hands.

00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:02.293
She lifted her head up,

00:03:02.293 --> 00:03:05.400
and I saw her face, said hello,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.659
and then I immediately noticed something

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.331
across the bridge of her nose,

00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:10.416
a crease in her skin.

00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:13.735
In medicine, we call that crease the allergic salute.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.547
It's usually seen among children
who have chronic allergies.

00:03:16.547 --> 00:03:19.303
It comes from chronically rubbing
one's nose up and down,

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:21.609
trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms,

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.646
and yet, here was Veronica, a grown woman,

00:03:23.646 --> 00:03:26.435
with the same telltale sign of allergies.

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:29.380
A few minutes later, in asking
Veronica some questions,

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.329
and examining her and listening to her,

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.134
I said, "Veronica, I think I know what you have.

00:03:34.134 --> 00:03:36.188
I think you have chronic allergies,

00:03:36.188 --> 00:03:38.451
and I think you have migraine
headaches and some sinus congestion,

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:41.989
and I think all of those are 
related to where you live."

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.733
She looked a little bit relieved,

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:45.708
because for the first time, she had a diagnosis,

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:47.945
but I said, "Veronica, now let's
talk about your treatment.

00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:51.387
We're going to order some
medications for your symptoms,

00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:54.920
but I also want to refer you to
a specialist, if that's okay."

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.226
Now, specialists are a little hard to find

00:03:57.226 --> 00:03:59.028
in South Central Los Angeles,

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:01.714
so she gave me this look, like, "Really?"

00:04:01.714 --> 00:04:04.391
And I said, "Veronica, actually,
the specialist I'm talking about

00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:06.677
is someone I call a community health worker,

00:04:06.677 --> 00:04:08.318
someone who, if it's okay with you,

00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:09.100
can come to your home

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.830
and try to understand what's going on

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.188
with those water leaks and that mold,

00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:16.226
trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms,

00:04:16.226 --> 00:04:18.318
and if required, that specialist might refer you

00:04:18.318 --> 00:04:20.810
to another specialist that we
call a public interest lawyer,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.503
because it might be that your landlord

00:04:22.503 --> 00:04:25.776
isn't making the fixes he's required to make."

00:04:25.776 --> 00:04:27.903
Veronica came back in a few months later.

00:04:27.903 --> 00:04:30.715
She agreed to all of those treatment plans.

00:04:30.715 --> 00:04:33.761
She told us that her symptoms
had improved by 90 percent.

00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:35.627
She was spending more time at work

00:04:35.627 --> 00:04:37.513
and with her family and less time

00:04:37.513 --> 00:04:42.123
shuttling back and forth between
the emergency rooms of Los Angeles.

00:04:42.123 --> 00:04:44.335
Veronica had improved remarkably.

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:46.329
Her sons, one of whom had asthma,

00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:48.104
were no longer as sick as they used to be.

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:50.491
She had gotten better, and not coincidentally,

00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:54.166
Veronica's home was better too.

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:56.010
What was it about this different approach we tried

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.604
that led to better care,

00:04:59.604 --> 00:05:03.163
fewer visits to the E.R., better health?

00:05:03.163 --> 00:05:05.260
Well, quite simply, it started with that question:

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.251
"Veronica, where do you live?"

00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:10.627
But more importantly, it was that we put in place

00:05:10.627 --> 00:05:13.197
a system that allowed us to routinely ask questions

00:05:13.197 --> 00:05:15.498
to Veronica and hundreds more like her

00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:17.357
about the conditions that mattered

00:05:17.357 --> 00:05:19.195
in her community, about where health,

00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:22.147
and unfortunately sometimes illness, do begin

00:05:22.147 --> 00:05:23.900
in places like South L.A.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.129
In that community, substandard housing

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:27.670
and food insecurity are the major conditions

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.492
that we as a clinic had to be aware of,

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:31.220
but in other communities it could be

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.300
transportation barriers, obesity,

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.685
access to parks, gun violence.

00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:38.919
The important thing is, we put in place a system

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.283
that worked,

00:05:40.283 --> 00:05:42.554
and it's an approach that I call an upstream approach.

00:05:42.554 --> 00:05:44.227
It's a term many of you are familiar with.

00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:46.344
It comes from a parable that's very common

00:05:46.344 --> 00:05:48.663
in the public health community.

00:05:48.663 --> 00:05:51.273
This is a parable of three friends.

00:05:51.273 --> 00:05:53.440
Imagine that you're one of these three friends

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.020
who come to a river.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.380
It's a beautiful scene, but it's
shattered by the cries of a child,

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.357
and actually several children,
in need of rescue in the water.

00:06:01.357 --> 00:06:03.250
So you do hopefully what everybody would do.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.041
You jump right in along with your friends.

00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:06.830
The first friend says, I'm going to rescue those

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.163
who are about to drown,

00:06:08.163 --> 00:06:10.199
those at most risk of falling over the waterfall.

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.134
The second friends says,
I'm going to build a raft.

00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:13.934
I'm going to make sure that fewer people

00:06:13.934 --> 00:06:15.419
need to end up at the waterfall's edge.

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:16.721
Let's usher more people to safety

00:06:16.721 --> 00:06:17.883
by building this raft,

00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:19.739
coordinating those branches together.

00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:22.110
Over time, they're successful, but not really,

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.012
as much as they want to be.

00:06:23.012 --> 00:06:25.273
More people slip through, and they finally look up

00:06:25.273 --> 00:06:26.543
and they see that their third friend

00:06:26.543 --> 00:06:27.960
is nowhere to be seen.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.391
They finally spot her.

00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:31.427
She's in the water. She's swimming away from them

00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:33.800
upstream, rescuing children as she goes,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.105
and they shout to her, "Where are you going?

00:06:35.105 --> 00:06:36.646
There are children here to save."

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.143
And she says back,

00:06:38.143 --> 00:06:39.372
"I'm going to find out

00:06:39.372 --> 00:06:43.430
who or what is throwing these children in the water."

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.329
In healthcare, we have that first friend —

00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:47.404
we have the specialist,

00:06:47.404 --> 00:06:49.950
we have the trauma surgeon, the ICU nurse,

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.974
the E.R. doctors.

00:06:50.974 --> 00:06:53.515
We have those people that are vital rescuers,

00:06:53.515 --> 00:06:56.920
people you want to be there
when you're in dire straits.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.179
We also know that we have the second friend —

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:00.874
we have that raft-builder.

00:07:00.874 --> 00:07:02.585
That's the primary care clinician,

00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:04.743
people on the care team who are there

00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:06.333
to manage your chronic conditions,

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:07.874
your diabetes, your hypertension,

00:07:07.874 --> 00:07:09.280
there to give you your annual checkups,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.485
there to make sure your vaccines are up to date,

00:07:11.485 --> 00:07:13.150
but also there to make sure that you have

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.626
a raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety.

00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:18.393
But while that's also vital and very necessary,

00:07:18.393 --> 00:07:20.237
what we're missing is that third friend.

00:07:20.237 --> 00:07:22.352
We don't have enough of that upstreamist.

00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:24.013
The upstreamists are the health care professionals

00:07:24.013 --> 00:07:26.300
who know that health does begin

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.291
where we live and work and play,

00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:30.823
but beyond that awareness, is able to mobilize

00:07:30.823 --> 00:07:33.110
the resources to create the system

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.918
in their clinics and in their hospitals

00:07:34.918 --> 00:07:38.304
that really does start to approach that,

00:07:38.304 --> 00:07:40.306
to connect people to the resources they need

00:07:40.306 --> 00:07:42.980
outside the four walls of the clinic.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.648
Now you might ask, and it's 
a very obvious question

00:07:44.648 --> 00:07:47.303
that a lot of colleagues in medicine ask:

00:07:47.303 --> 00:07:50.449
"Doctors and nurses thinking
about transportation and housing?

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:52.759
Shouldn't we just provide pills and procedures

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:54.491
and just make sure we focus on the task at hand?"

00:07:54.491 --> 00:07:57.337
Certainly, rescuing people at the water's edge

00:07:57.337 --> 00:08:00.454
is important enough work.

00:08:00.454 --> 00:08:01.725
Who has the time?

00:08:01.725 --> 00:08:04.616
I would argue, though, that if we
were to use science as our guide,

00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:07.349
that we would find an upstream
approach is absolutely necessary.

00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:09.104
Scientists now know that

00:08:09.104 --> 00:08:11.354
the living and working conditions that we all

00:08:11.354 --> 00:08:12.990
are part of

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.380
have more than twice the impact on our health

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.507
than does our genetic code,

00:08:17.507 --> 00:08:18.840
and living and working conditions,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.226
the structures of our environments,

00:08:20.226 --> 00:08:23.695
the ways in which our social fabric is woven together,

00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:25.877
and the impact those have on our behaviors,

00:08:25.877 --> 00:08:28.190
all together, those have more than five times

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.155
the impact on our health

00:08:29.155 --> 00:08:31.164
than do all the pills and procedures

00:08:31.164 --> 00:08:33.213
administered by doctors and hospitals combined.

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:36.384
All together, living and working conditions

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:40.480
account for 60 percent of preventable death.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.060
Let me give you an example of what this feels like.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.663
Let's say there was a company, a tech startup

00:08:44.663 --> 00:08:46.564
that came to you and said, "We have a great product.

00:08:46.564 --> 00:08:49.388
It's going to lower your risk
of death from heart disease."

00:08:49.388 --> 00:08:51.289
Now, you might be likely to invest

00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:54.473
if that product was a drug or a device,

00:08:54.473 --> 00:08:57.211
but what if that product was a park?

00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:58.767
A study in the U.K.,

00:08:58.767 --> 00:09:00.851
a landmark study that reviewed the records

00:09:00.851 --> 00:09:04.192
of over 40 million residents in the U.K.,

00:09:04.192 --> 00:09:06.020
looked at several variables,

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.587
controlled for a lot of factors, and found that

00:09:08.587 --> 00:09:12.670
when trying to adjust the risk of heart disease,

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.701
one's exposure to green
space was a powerful influence.

00:09:15.701 --> 00:09:17.580
The closer you were to green space,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.922
to parks and trees,

00:09:18.922 --> 00:09:20.417
the lower your chance of heart disease,

00:09:20.417 --> 00:09:23.224
and that stayed true for rich and for poor.

00:09:23.224 --> 00:09:25.544
That study illustrates what my friends in public health

00:09:25.544 --> 00:09:27.042
often say these days:

00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:29.110
that one's zip code matters more

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.786
than your genetic code.

00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:32.235
We're also learning that zip code

00:09:32.235 --> 00:09:34.670
is actually shaping our genetic code.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.887
The science of epigenetics looks
at those molecular mechanisms,

00:09:37.887 --> 00:09:40.920
those intricate ways in which
our DNA is literally shaped,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.488
genes turned on and off

00:09:42.488 --> 00:09:44.682
based on the exposures to the environment,

00:09:44.682 --> 00:09:47.426
to where we live and to where we work.

00:09:47.426 --> 00:09:49.283
So it's clear that these factors,

00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:51.366
these upstream issues, do matter.

00:09:51.366 --> 00:09:53.069
They matter to our health,

00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:55.562
and therefore our healthcare professionals
should do something about it.

00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:57.330
And yet, Veronica asked me

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.289
perhaps the most compelling question

00:09:58.289 --> 00:09:59.697
I've been asked in a long time.

00:09:59.697 --> 00:10:01.835
In that follow-up visit, she said,

00:10:01.835 --> 00:10:03.987
"Why did none of my doctors

00:10:03.987 --> 00:10:06.865
ask about my home before?

00:10:06.865 --> 00:10:09.069
In those visits to the emergency room,

00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:10.870
I had two CAT scans,

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.827
I had a needle placed in the lower part of my back

00:10:12.827 --> 00:10:14.357
to collect spinal fluid,

00:10:14.357 --> 00:10:15.831
I had nearly a dozen blood tests.

00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:18.485
I went back and forth, I saw
all sorts of people in healthcare,

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:22.770
and no one asked about my home."

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.508
The honest answer is that in healthcare,

00:10:24.508 --> 00:10:26.203
we often treat symptoms without addressing

00:10:26.203 --> 00:10:29.323
the conditions that make you sick in the first place.

00:10:29.323 --> 00:10:31.167
And there are many reasons for that, but the big three

00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:35.767
are first, we don't pay for that.

00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:39.152
In healthcare, we often pay 
for volume and not value.

00:10:39.152 --> 00:10:40.940
We pay doctors and hospitals usually

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.920
for the number of services they provide,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.219
but not necessarily on how healthy they make you.

00:10:46.219 --> 00:10:48.530
That leads to a second phenomenon that I call

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.910
the "don't ask, don't tell" approach

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.484
to upstream issues in healthcare.

00:10:52.484 --> 00:10:54.228
We don't ask about where you
live and where you work,

00:10:54.228 --> 00:10:55.453
because if there's a problem there,

00:10:55.453 --> 00:10:58.349
we don't know what to tell you.

00:10:58.349 --> 00:11:01.169
It's not that doctors don't know
these are important issues.

00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:03.040
In a recent survey done in the U.S. among physicians,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.931
over 1,000 physicians,

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:06.743
80 percent of them actually said that

00:11:06.743 --> 00:11:08.441
they know that their patients' upstream problems

00:11:08.441 --> 00:11:10.328
are as important as their health issues,

00:11:10.328 --> 00:11:12.020
as their medical problems,

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.381
and yet despite that widespread awareness

00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:16.315
of the importance of upstream issues,

00:11:16.315 --> 00:11:18.588
only one in five doctors said they had

00:11:18.588 --> 00:11:21.453
any sense of confidence to address those issues,

00:11:21.453 --> 00:11:23.301
to improve health where it begins.

00:11:23.301 --> 00:11:24.843
There's this gap between knowing

00:11:24.843 --> 00:11:27.272
that patients' lives, the context
of where they live and work,

00:11:27.272 --> 00:11:30.080
matters, and the ability to do something about it

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.857
in the systems in which we work.

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:34.191
This is a huge problem right now,

00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:36.339
because it leads them to this next question, which is,

00:11:36.339 --> 00:11:37.926
whose responsibility is it?

00:11:37.926 --> 00:11:39.635
And that brings me to that third point,

00:11:39.635 --> 00:11:42.909
that third answer to Veronica's compelling question.

00:11:42.909 --> 00:11:44.495
Part of the reason that we have this conundrum

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:48.250
is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.295
in the healthcare system.

00:11:50.295 --> 00:11:52.195
There are not nearly enough of that third friend,

00:11:52.195 --> 00:11:53.959
that person who is going to find out

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:56.816
who or what is throwing those kids in the water.

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:58.521
Now, there are many upstreamists,

00:11:58.521 --> 00:12:00.962
and I've had the privilege of meeting many of them,

00:12:00.962 --> 00:12:03.589
in Los Angeles and in other parts of the country

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:05.357
and around the world,

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:07.785
and it's important to note that upstreamists

00:12:07.785 --> 00:12:10.322
sometimes are doctors, but they need not be.

00:12:10.322 --> 00:12:12.515
They can be nurses, other clinicians,

00:12:12.515 --> 00:12:14.523
care managers, social workers.

00:12:14.523 --> 00:12:16.475
It's not so important what specific degree

00:12:16.475 --> 00:12:18.274
upstreamists have at the end of their name.

00:12:18.274 --> 00:12:20.030
What's more important is that they all seem

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:24.455
to share the same ability to implement a process

00:12:24.455 --> 00:12:26.244
that transforms their assistance,

00:12:26.244 --> 00:12:28.590
transforms the way they practice medicine.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.176
That process is a quite simple process.

00:12:30.176 --> 00:12:32.549
It's one, two and three.

00:12:32.549 --> 00:12:34.200
First, they sit down and they say,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.224
let's identify the clinical problem

00:12:36.224 --> 00:12:37.567
among a certain set of patients.

00:12:37.567 --> 00:12:39.310
Let's say, for instance,

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.244
let's try to help children

00:12:41.244 --> 00:12:43.048
who are bouncing in and out of the hospital

00:12:43.048 --> 00:12:45.130
with asthma.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.641
After identifying the problem, they 
then move on to that second step,

00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:50.380
and they say, let's identify the root cause.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.171
Now, a root cause analysis, in healthcare,

00:12:54.171 --> 00:12:55.886
usually says, well, let's look at your genes,

00:12:55.886 --> 00:12:58.344
let's look at how you're behaving.

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:00.424
Maybe you're not eating healthy enough.

00:13:00.424 --> 00:13:01.440
Eat healthier.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.835
It's a pretty simplistic

00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:04.241
approach to root cause analyses.

00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:05.906
It turns out, it doesn't really work

00:13:05.906 --> 00:13:08.370
when we just limit ourselves that worldview.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.471
The root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings

00:13:10.471 --> 00:13:12.408
to the table is to say, let's look at the living

00:13:12.408 --> 00:13:15.760
and the working conditions in your life.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.842
Perhaps, for children with asthma,

00:13:17.842 --> 00:13:19.450
it's what's happening in their home,

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.386
or perhaps they live close to a
freeway with major air pollution

00:13:22.386 --> 00:13:24.210
that triggers their asthma.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.830
And perhaps that's what we should
mobilize our resources to address,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.203
because that third element,
that third part of the process,

00:13:29.203 --> 00:13:31.734
is that next critical part of what upstreamists do.

00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:33.973
They mobilize the resources to create a solution,

00:13:33.973 --> 00:13:35.694
both within the clinical system,

00:13:35.694 --> 00:13:38.030
and then by bringing in people from public health,

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.372
from other sectors, lawyers,

00:13:39.372 --> 00:13:41.319
whoever is willing to play ball,

00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:43.402
let's bring in to create a solution that makes sense,

00:13:43.402 --> 00:13:46.212
to take those patients who
actually have clinical problems

00:13:46.212 --> 00:13:48.395
and address their root causes together

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:50.937
by linking them to the resources you need.

00:13:50.937 --> 00:13:52.714
It's clear to me that there are so many stories

00:13:52.714 --> 00:13:55.200
of upstreamists who are doing remarkable things.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.860
The problem is that there's just not
nearly enough of them out there.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.443
By some estimates, we need one upstreamist

00:14:00.443 --> 00:14:03.389
for every 20 to 30 clinicians
in the healthcare system.

00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:04.644
In the U.S., for instance, that would mean

00:14:04.644 --> 00:14:06.740
that we need 25,000 upstreamists

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.207
by the year 2020.

00:14:10.207 --> 00:14:14.317
But we only have a few thousand upstreamists
out there right now, by all accounts,

00:14:14.317 --> 00:14:16.870
and that's why, a few years ago, my colleagues and I

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.787
said, you know what, we need to train

00:14:18.787 --> 00:14:20.760
and make more upstreamists.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.466
So we decided to start an organization

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:24.684
called Health Begins,

00:14:24.684 --> 00:14:26.430
and Health Begins simply does that:

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.390
We train upstreamists.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.328
And there are a lot of measures
that we use for our success,

00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:30.689
but the main thing that we're interested in

00:14:30.689 --> 00:14:32.601
is making sure that we're changing

00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:34.140
the sense of confidence,

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.045
that "don't ask, don't tell" metric among clinicians.

00:14:36.045 --> 00:14:38.344
We're trying to make sure that clinicians,

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:40.284
and therefore their systems that they work in

00:14:40.284 --> 00:14:42.579
have the ability, the confidence

00:14:42.579 --> 00:14:45.254
to address the problems in the living

00:14:45.254 --> 00:14:48.261
and working conditions in our lives.

00:14:48.261 --> 00:14:50.240
We're seeing nearly a tripling

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.821
of that confidence in our work.

00:14:51.821 --> 00:14:53.124
It's remarkable,

00:14:53.124 --> 00:14:55.038
but I'll tell you the most compelling part

00:14:55.038 --> 00:14:56.607
of what it means to be working

00:14:56.607 --> 00:15:01.090
with upstreamists to gather them together.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.413
What is most compelling is that every day,

00:15:03.413 --> 00:15:07.184
every week, I hear stories just like Veronica's.

00:15:07.184 --> 00:15:09.662
There are stories out there of Veronica

00:15:09.662 --> 00:15:11.581
and many more like her,

00:15:11.581 --> 00:15:13.462
people who are coming to the healthcare system

00:15:13.462 --> 00:15:14.840
and getting a glimpse of what it feels like

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.400
to be part of something that works,

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.873
a health care system that stops
bouncing you back and forth

00:15:19.873 --> 00:15:21.694
but actually improves your health,

00:15:21.694 --> 00:15:22.821
listens to you who you are,

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:25.124
addresses the context of your life,

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:29.489
whether you're rich or poor or middle class.

00:15:29.489 --> 00:15:31.144
These stories are compelling because

00:15:31.144 --> 00:15:33.124
not only do they tell us that we're this close

00:15:33.124 --> 00:15:35.710
to getting the healthcare system that we want,

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.459
but that there's something
that we can all do to get there.

00:15:38.459 --> 00:15:40.321
Doctors and nurses can get better at asking

00:15:40.321 --> 00:15:42.165
about the context of patients' lives,

00:15:42.165 --> 00:15:44.676
not simply because it's better bedside manner,

00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:47.758
but frankly, because it's a better standard of care.

00:15:47.758 --> 00:15:50.100
Healthcare systems and payers

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.890
can start to bring in public health agencies

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.305
and departments and say,

00:15:54.305 --> 00:15:55.843
let's look at our data together.

00:15:55.843 --> 00:15:59.369
Let's see if we can discover some patterns
in our data about our patients' lives

00:15:59.369 --> 00:16:01.840
and see if we can identify an upstream cause,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.401
and then, as importantly, can we align the resources

00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:06.737
to be able to address them?

00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:08.131
Medical schools, nursing schools,

00:16:08.131 --> 00:16:10.427
all sorts of health professional education programs

00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:14.183
can help by training the
next generation of upstreamists.

00:16:14.183 --> 00:16:15.938
We can also make sure that these schools

00:16:15.938 --> 00:16:19.166
certify a backbone of the upstream approach,

00:16:19.166 --> 00:16:21.361
and that's the community health worker.

00:16:21.361 --> 00:16:22.880
We need many more of them
in the healthcare system

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.233
if we're truly going to have it be effective,

00:16:25.233 --> 00:16:26.740
to move from a sickcare system

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.238
to a healthcare system.

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:30.286
But finally, and perhaps most importantly,

00:16:30.286 --> 00:16:32.845
what do we do? What do we do as patients?

00:16:32.845 --> 00:16:35.110
We can start by simply going to our doctors

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.819
and our nurses, to our clinics,

00:16:36.819 --> 00:16:39.151
and asking, "Is there something in where I live

00:16:39.151 --> 00:16:41.494
and where I work that I should be aware of?"

00:16:41.494 --> 00:16:44.342
Are there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of,

00:16:44.342 --> 00:16:46.300
and more importantly, if there are barriers

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.281
that I'm surfacing, if I'm coming to you

00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:50.400
and I'm saying I think have a problem with

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.503
my apartment or at my workplace

00:16:52.503 --> 00:16:54.699
or I don't have access to transportation,

00:16:54.699 --> 00:16:56.330
or there's a park that's way too far,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.190
so sorry doctor, I can't take your advice

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.276
to go and jog,

00:17:00.276 --> 00:17:02.157
if those problems exist,

00:17:02.157 --> 00:17:05.453
then doctor, are you willing to listen?

00:17:05.453 --> 00:17:06.866
And what can we do together

00:17:06.866 --> 00:17:09.436
to improve my health where it begins?

00:17:09.436 --> 00:17:11.880
If we're all able to do this work,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.419
doctors and healthcare systems,

00:17:13.419 --> 00:17:15.499
payers, and all of us together,

00:17:15.499 --> 00:17:17.693
we'll realize something about health.

00:17:17.693 --> 00:17:21.115
Health is not just a personal
responsibility or phenomenon.

00:17:21.115 --> 00:17:24.617
Health is a common good.

00:17:24.617 --> 00:17:26.535
It comes from our personal investment in knowing

00:17:26.535 --> 00:17:28.816
that our lives matter,

00:17:28.816 --> 00:17:30.944
the context of where we live and where we work,

00:17:30.944 --> 00:17:32.680
eat, and sleep, matter,

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.304
and that what we do for ourselves,

00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:36.424
we also should do for those

00:17:36.424 --> 00:17:38.440
whose living and working conditions

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.058
again, can be hard, if not harsh.

00:17:41.058 --> 00:17:43.544
We can all invest in making sure that we improve

00:17:43.544 --> 00:17:45.794
the allocation of resources upstream,

00:17:45.794 --> 00:17:47.977
but at the same time work together

00:17:47.977 --> 00:17:50.710
and show that we can move healthcare

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.747
upstream.

00:17:52.747 --> 00:17:55.820
We can improve health where it begins.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.847
Thank you.

00:17:57.847 --> 00:18:00.401
(Applause)
