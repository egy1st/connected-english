00:00:00.604 --> 00:00:01.820
Today I want to tell you

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.623
about a project being carried out

00:00:03.623 --> 00:00:06.310
by scientists all over the world

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.598
to paint a neural portrait of the human mind.

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:11.770
And the central idea of this work

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.628
is that the human mind and brain

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:16.485
is not a single, general-purpose processor,

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:19.927
but a collection of highly specialized components,

00:00:19.927 --> 00:00:22.910
each solving a different specific problem,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.246
and yet collectively making up

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:29.602
who we are as human beings and thinkers.

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:31.078
To give you a feel for this idea,

00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:33.742
imagine the following scenario:

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.938
You walk into your child's day care center.

00:00:35.938 --> 00:00:38.175
As usual, there's a dozen kids there

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:39.766
waiting to get picked up,

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.398
but this time,

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:44.383
the children's faces look weirdly similar,

00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:47.191
and you can't figure out which child is yours.

00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:48.940
Do you need new glasses?

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.848
Are you losing your mind?

00:00:50.848 --> 00:00:53.300
You run through a quick mental checklist.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.194
No, you seem to be thinking clearly,

00:00:55.194 --> 00:00:57.585
and your vision is perfectly sharp.

00:00:57.585 --> 00:00:59.374
And everything looks normal

00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:01.536
except the children's faces.

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:03.322
You can see the faces,

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:05.030
but they don't look distinctive,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.888
and none of them looks familiar,

00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:09.386
and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:11.282
that you find your daughter.

00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:14.707
This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.253
actually happens to people.

00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:18.307
It's called prosopagnosia,

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:19.488
and it results from damage

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:21.614
to a particular part of the brain.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.114
The striking thing about it

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:25.709
is that only face recognition is impaired;

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.148
everything else is just fine.

00:01:28.148 --> 00:01:32.016
Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:36.551
mental deficits that can happen after brain damage.

00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:37.914
These syndromes collectively

00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:40.153
have suggested for a long time

00:01:40.153 --> 00:01:43.921
that the mind is divvied up into distinct components,

00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:46.306
but the effort to discover those components

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:47.920
has jumped to warp speed

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.502
with the invention of brain imaging technology,

00:01:50.502 --> 00:01:53.550
especially MRI.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.790
So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.376
at high resolution,

00:01:58.376 --> 00:01:59.806
so I'm going to show you in a second

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:03.158
a set of MRI cross-sectional images

00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:04.776
through a familiar object,

00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:05.651
and we're going to fly through them

00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:08.124
and you're going to try to figure out what the object is.

00:02:08.124 --> 00:02:10.235
Here we go.

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.130
It's not that easy. It's an artichoke.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.760
Okay, let's try another one,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.356
starting from the bottom and going through the top.

00:02:20.812 --> 00:02:21.963
Broccoli! It's a head of broccoli.

00:02:21.963 --> 00:02:23.627
Isn't it beautiful? I love that.

00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:26.384
Okay, here's another one. It's a brain, of course.

00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:27.970
In fact, it's my brain.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.703
We're going through slices through my head like that.

00:02:29.703 --> 00:02:31.461
That's my nose over on the right, and now

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:34.870
we're going over here, right there.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.471
So this picture's nice, if I do say so myself,

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:41.383
but it shows only anatomy.

00:02:41.383 --> 00:02:43.903
The really cool advance with functional imaging

00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:45.475
happened when scientists figured out how to make

00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:48.870
pictures that show not just anatomy but activity,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.305
that is, where neurons are firing.

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:52.821
So here's how this works.

00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:53.938
Brains are like muscles.

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:55.501
When they get active,

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:58.475
they need increased blood flow to supply that activity,

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:02.043
and lucky for us, blood flow
control to the brain is local,

00:03:02.043 --> 00:03:04.205
so if a bunch of neurons, say, right there

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:05.705
get active and start firing,

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:08.430
then blood flow increases just right there.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.151
So functional MRI picks up
on that blood flow increase,

00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:14.184
producing a higher MRI response

00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:17.110
where neural activity goes up.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.810
So to give you a concrete feel

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.295
for how a functional MRI experiment goes

00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:22.734
and what you can learn from it

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:24.118
and what you can't,

00:03:24.118 --> 00:03:27.560
let me describe one of the first studies I ever did.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.698
We wanted to know if there was a special
part of the brain for recognizing faces,

00:03:31.698 --> 00:03:34.770
and there was already reason to
think there might be such a thing

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.490
based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.613
that I described a moment ago,

00:03:38.613 --> 00:03:40.891
but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain

00:03:40.891 --> 00:03:42.810
in a normal person,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.866
so we set out to look for it.

00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:46.817
So I was the first subject.

00:03:46.817 --> 00:03:49.029
I went into the scanner, I lay on my back,

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.612
I held my head as still as I could

00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:56.629
while staring at pictures of faces like these

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.760
and objects like these

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.925
and faces and objects for hours.

00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:06.697
So as somebody who has
pretty close to the world record

00:04:06.697 --> 00:04:10.240
of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.672
I can tell you that one of the skills

00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:14.335
that's really important for MRI research

00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:16.113
is bladder control.

00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:17.915
(Laughter)

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:19.452
When I got out of the scanner,

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:21.768
I did a quick analysis of the data,

00:04:21.768 --> 00:04:23.271
looking for any parts of my brain

00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:26.077
that produced a higher response
when I was looking at faces

00:04:26.077 --> 00:04:27.947
than when I was looking at objects,

00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:30.118
and here's what I saw.

00:04:30.118 --> 00:04:33.774
Now this image looks just awful by today's standards,

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:36.582
but at the time I thought it was beautiful.

00:04:36.582 --> 00:04:38.532
What it shows is that region right there,

00:04:38.532 --> 00:04:39.815
that little blob,

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:41.562
it's about the size of an olive

00:04:41.562 --> 00:04:43.718
and it's on the bottom surface of my brain

00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:46.924
about an inch straight in from right there.

00:04:46.924 --> 00:04:49.714
And what that part of my brain is doing

00:04:49.714 --> 00:04:52.634
is producing a higher MRI response,

00:04:52.634 --> 00:04:54.382
that is, higher neural activity,

00:04:54.382 --> 00:04:55.864
when I was looking at faces

00:04:55.864 --> 00:04:58.130
than when I was looking at objects.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.490
So that's pretty cool,

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.808
but how do we know this isn't a fluke?

00:05:01.808 --> 00:05:03.228
Well, the easiest way

00:05:03.228 --> 00:05:05.342
is to just do the experiment again.

00:05:05.342 --> 00:05:06.981
So I got back in the scanner,

00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:09.412
I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects

00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:11.601
and I got a similar blob,

00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:13.496
and then I did it again

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:15.351
and I did it again

00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:18.423
and again and again,

00:05:18.423 --> 00:05:19.470
and around about then

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.411
I decided to believe it was for real.

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:26.164
But still, maybe this is
something weird about my brain

00:05:26.164 --> 00:05:28.626
and no one else has one of these things in there,

00:05:28.626 --> 00:05:31.081
so to find out, we scanned a bunch of other people

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.527
and found that pretty much everyone

00:05:33.527 --> 00:05:35.533
has that little face-processing region

00:05:35.533 --> 00:05:38.426
in a similar neighborhood of the brain.

00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:40.314
So the next question was,

00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:41.788
what does this thing really do?

00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:45.720
Is it really specialized just for face recognition?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.960
Well, maybe not, right?

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.762
Maybe it responds not only to faces

00:05:48.762 --> 00:05:50.871
but to any body part.

00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:53.240
Maybe it responds to anything human

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.020
or anything alive

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.676
or anything round.

00:05:56.676 --> 00:05:58.830
The only way to be really sure that that region

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.247
is specialized for face recognition

00:06:01.247 --> 00:06:03.890
is to rule out all of those hypotheses.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.720
So we spent much of the next couple of years

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.367
scanning subjects while they looked at lots

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:09.973
of different kinds of images,

00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:11.930
and we showed that that part of the brain

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.880
responds strongly when you look at

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.333
any images that are faces of any kind,

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:19.246
and it responds much less strongly

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:22.395
to any image you show that isn't a face,

00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:23.700
like some of these.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.939
So have we finally nailed the case

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:29.179
that this region is necessary for face recognition?

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:30.502
No, we haven't.

00:06:30.502 --> 00:06:32.453
Brain imaging can never tell you

00:06:32.453 --> 00:06:34.893
if a region is necessary for anything.

00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:36.333
All you can do with brain imaging

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:38.381
is watch regions turn on and off

00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:40.349
as people think different thoughts.

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.960
To tell if a part of the brain is
necessary for a mental function,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.469
you need to mess with it and see what happens,

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:48.744
and normally we don't get to do that.

00:06:48.744 --> 00:06:51.328
But an amazing opportunity came about

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:53.792
very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine

00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:56.863
tested this man who has epilepsy

00:06:56.863 --> 00:06:59.545
and who is shown here in his hospital bed

00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:00.912
where he's just had electrodes placed

00:07:00.912 --> 00:07:02.983
on the surface of his brain

00:07:02.983 --> 00:07:05.537
to identify the source of his seizures.

00:07:05.537 --> 00:07:08.070
So it turned out by total chance

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.019
that two of the electrodes

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:13.242
happened to be right on top of his face area.

00:07:13.242 --> 00:07:15.571
So with the patient's consent,

00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:18.158
the doctors asked him what happened

00:07:18.158 --> 00:07:22.324
when they electrically stimulated
that part of his brain.

00:07:22.324 --> 00:07:23.978
Now, the patient doesn't know

00:07:23.978 --> 00:07:25.362
where those electrodes are,

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.574
and he's never heard of the face area.

00:07:27.574 --> 00:07:29.565
So let's watch what happens.

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:31.534
It's going to start with a control condition

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.941
that will say "Sham" nearly invisibly

00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:35.651
in red in the lower left,

00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:37.933
when no current is delivered,

00:07:37.933 --> 00:07:41.748
and you'll hear the neurologist speaking
to the patient first. So let's watch.

00:07:41.748 --> 00:07:43.829
(Video) Neurologist: Okay, just look at my face

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:47.114
and tell me what happens when I do this.

00:07:47.114 --> 00:07:48.048
All right?

00:07:48.048 --> 00:07:50.871
Patient: Okay.

00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:55.191
Neurologist: One, two, three.

00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:58.206
Patient: Nothing.
Neurologist: Nothing? Okay.

00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:00.613
I'm going to do it one more time.

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:03.807
Look at my face.

00:08:03.807 --> 00:08:08.307
One, two, three.

00:08:08.307 --> 00:08:11.131
Patient: You just turned into somebody else.

00:08:11.131 --> 00:08:13.268
Your face metamorphosed.

00:08:13.268 --> 00:08:16.279
Your nose got saggy, it went to the left.

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:19.815
You almost looked like somebody I'd seen before,

00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:22.449
but somebody different.

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:24.521
That was a trip.

00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:27.653
(Laughter)

00:08:27.653 --> 00:08:29.268
Nancy Kanwisher: So this experiment —

00:08:29.268 --> 00:08:33.491
(Applause) —

00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:36.173
this experiment finally nails the case

00:08:36.173 --> 00:08:37.998
that this region of the brain is not only

00:08:37.998 --> 00:08:40.135
selectively responsive to faces

00:08:40.135 --> 00:08:43.180
but causally involved in face perception.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.310
So I went through all of these details

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.774
about the face region to show you what it takes

00:08:47.774 --> 00:08:50.113
to really establish that a part of the brain

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:53.241
is selectively involved in a specific mental process.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.400
Next, I'll go through much more quickly

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.060
some of the other specialized regions of the brain

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.160
that we and others have found.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.274
So to do this, I've spent a lot of time

00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:04.141
in the scanner over the last month

00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:06.402
so I can show you these things in my brain.

00:09:06.402 --> 00:09:09.635
So let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere.

00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:12.297
So we're oriented like that.
You're looking at my head this way.

00:09:12.297 --> 00:09:13.390
Imagine taking the skull off

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.658
and looking at the surface of the brain like that.

00:09:15.658 --> 00:09:17.416
Okay, now as you can see,

00:09:17.416 --> 00:09:18.919
the surface of the brain is all folded up.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:20.640
So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.074
We want to see the whole thing,

00:09:22.074 --> 00:09:25.386
so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing.

00:09:25.386 --> 00:09:28.215
Next, let's find that face area I've been talking about

00:09:28.215 --> 00:09:30.442
that responds to images like these.

00:09:30.442 --> 00:09:31.961
To see that, let's turn the brain around

00:09:31.961 --> 00:09:33.980
and look on the inside surface on the bottom,

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.285
and there it is, that's my face area.

00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:38.992
Just to the right of that is another region

00:09:38.992 --> 00:09:40.630
that is shown in purple

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.702
that responds when you process color information,

00:09:43.702 --> 00:09:46.393
and near those regions are other regions

00:09:46.393 --> 00:09:48.756
that are involved in perceiving places,

00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:51.594
like right now, I'm seeing
this layout of space around me

00:09:51.594 --> 00:09:53.346
and these regions in green right there

00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:54.620
are really active.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.990
There's another one out on the outside surface again

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.795
where there's a couple more face regions as well.

00:09:59.795 --> 00:10:02.140
Also in this vicinity

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.785
is a region that's selectively involved

00:10:03.785 --> 00:10:05.721
in processing visual motion,

00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:07.225
like these moving dots here,

00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:09.914
and that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain,

00:10:09.914 --> 00:10:13.082
and near that is a region that responds

00:10:13.082 --> 00:10:15.979
when you look at images of bodies and body parts

00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:18.724
like these, and that region is shown in lime green

00:10:18.724 --> 00:10:20.727
at the bottom of the brain.

00:10:20.727 --> 00:10:23.359
Now all these regions I've shown you so far

00:10:23.359 --> 00:10:27.791
are involved in specific aspects of visual perception.

00:10:27.791 --> 00:10:29.939
Do we also have specialized brain regions

00:10:29.939 --> 00:10:32.752
for other senses, like hearing?

00:10:32.752 --> 00:10:35.789
Yes, we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit,

00:10:35.789 --> 00:10:38.190
here's a region in dark blue

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.536
that we reported just a couple of months ago,

00:10:40.536 --> 00:10:42.170
and this region responds strongly

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.599
when you hear sounds with pitch, like these.

00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:47.742
(Sirens)

00:10:47.742 --> 00:10:49.823
(Cello music)

00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:51.740
(Doorbell)

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.348
In contrast, that same region
does not respond strongly

00:10:55.348 --> 00:10:56.910
when you hear perfectly familiar sounds

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.272
that don't have a clear pitch, like these.

00:10:59.272 --> 00:11:01.741
(Chomping)

00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:03.941
(Drum roll)

00:11:03.941 --> 00:11:06.708
(Toilet flushing)

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:09.206
Okay. Next to the pitch region

00:11:09.206 --> 00:11:11.680
is another set of regions that
are selectively responsive

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.445
when you hear the sounds of speech.

00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:16.285
Okay, now let's look at these same regions.

00:11:16.285 --> 00:11:18.753
In my left hemisphere, there's a similar arrangement —

00:11:18.753 --> 00:11:20.226
not identical, but similar —

00:11:20.226 --> 00:11:22.435
and most of the same regions are in here,

00:11:22.435 --> 00:11:24.437
albeit sometimes different in size.

00:11:24.437 --> 00:11:26.451
Now, everything I've shown you so far

00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:29.477
are regions that are involved in
different aspects of perception,

00:11:29.477 --> 00:11:31.310
vision and hearing.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:32.970
Do we also have specialized brain regions

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.405
for really fancy, complicated mental processes?

00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:37.834
Yes, we do.

00:11:37.834 --> 00:11:41.223
So here in pink are my language regions.

00:11:41.223 --> 00:11:42.651
So it's been known for a very long time

00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:44.686
that that general vicinity of the brain

00:11:44.686 --> 00:11:46.879
is involved in processing language,

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:48.611
but we showed very recently

00:11:48.611 --> 00:11:50.321
that these pink regions

00:11:50.321 --> 00:11:52.526
respond extremely selectively.

00:11:52.526 --> 00:11:55.338
They respond when you understand
the meaning of a sentence,

00:11:55.338 --> 00:11:58.176
but not when you do other complex mental things,

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.355
like mental arithmetic

00:12:00.355 --> 00:12:02.751
or holding information in memory

00:12:02.751 --> 00:12:05.406
or appreciating the complex structure

00:12:05.406 --> 00:12:07.690
in a piece of music.

00:12:09.664 --> 00:12:12.553
The most amazing region that's been found yet

00:12:12.553 --> 00:12:15.860
is this one right here in turquoise.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.050
This region responds

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.318
when you think about what another person is thinking.

00:12:22.318 --> 00:12:23.962
So that may seem crazy,

00:12:23.962 --> 00:12:27.830
but actually, we humans do this all the time.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.023
You're doing this when you realize

00:12:30.023 --> 00:12:31.654
that your partner is going to be worried

00:12:31.654 --> 00:12:34.161
if you don't call home to say you're running late.

00:12:34.161 --> 00:12:37.630
I'm doing this with that region of my brain right now

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.911
when I realize that you guys

00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:41.509
are probably now wondering about

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:44.056
all that gray, uncharted territory in the brain,

00:12:44.056 --> 00:12:46.020
and what's up with that?

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.705
Well, I'm wondering about that too,

00:12:47.705 --> 00:12:50.100
and we're running a bunch of
experiments in my lab right now

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.113
to try to find a number of other

00:12:52.113 --> 00:12:54.145
possible specializations in the brain

00:12:54.145 --> 00:12:57.513
for other very specific mental functions.

00:12:57.513 --> 00:13:00.134
But importantly, I don't think we have

00:13:00.134 --> 00:13:01.698
specializations in the brain

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.444
for every important mental function,

00:13:04.444 --> 00:13:07.853
even mental functions that may be critical for survival.

00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:09.955
In fact, a few years ago,

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.072
there was a scientist in my lab

00:13:11.072 --> 00:13:12.481
who became quite convinced

00:13:12.481 --> 00:13:14.230
that he'd found a brain region

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.142
for detecting food,

00:13:16.142 --> 00:13:18.060
and it responded really strongly in the scanner

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.788
when people looked at images like this.

00:13:20.788 --> 00:13:23.700
And further, he found a similar response

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.639
in more or less the same location

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.640
in 10 out of 12 subjects.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.934
So he was pretty stoked,

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.194
and he was running around the lab

00:13:31.194 --> 00:13:33.196
telling everyone that he was going to go on "Oprah"

00:13:33.196 --> 00:13:35.214
with his big discovery.

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:38.236
But then he devised the critical test:

00:13:38.236 --> 00:13:41.419
He showed subjects images of food like this

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:44.160
and compared them to images with very similar

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.970
color and shape, but that weren't food, like these.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.101
And his region responded the same

00:13:50.101 --> 00:13:52.050
to both sets of images.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.377
So it wasn't a food area,

00:13:53.377 --> 00:13:56.148
it was just a region that liked colors and shapes.

00:13:56.148 --> 00:13:58.709
So much for "Oprah."

00:14:00.483 --> 00:14:02.708
But then the question, of course, is,

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:04.834
how do we process all this other stuff

00:14:04.834 --> 00:14:07.804
that we don't have specialized brain regions for?

00:14:07.804 --> 00:14:09.615
Well, I think the answer is that in addition

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:13.169
to these highly specialized components
that I've been describing,

00:14:13.169 --> 00:14:16.848
we also have a lot of very general-
purpose machinery in our heads

00:14:16.848 --> 00:14:18.342
that enables us to tackle

00:14:18.342 --> 00:14:20.448
whatever problem comes along.

00:14:20.448 --> 00:14:22.503
In fact, we've shown recently that

00:14:22.503 --> 00:14:24.571
these regions here in white

00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:27.982
respond whenever you do any difficult mental task

00:14:27.982 --> 00:14:29.083
at all —

00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:32.654
well, of the seven that we've tested.

00:14:32.654 --> 00:14:34.823
So each of the brain regions that I've described

00:14:34.823 --> 00:14:36.129
to you today

00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:38.896
is present in approximately the same location

00:14:38.896 --> 00:14:40.638
in every normal subject.

00:14:40.638 --> 00:14:42.261
I could take any of you,

00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:43.487
pop you in the scanner,

00:14:43.487 --> 00:14:45.772
and find each of those regions in your brain,

00:14:45.772 --> 00:14:47.677
and it would look a lot like my brain,

00:14:47.677 --> 00:14:49.747
although the regions would be slightly different

00:14:49.747 --> 00:14:53.311
in their exact location and in their size.

00:14:53.311 --> 00:14:55.676
What's important to me about this work

00:14:55.676 --> 00:14:58.645
is not the particular locations of these brain regions,

00:14:58.645 --> 00:15:01.232
but the simple fact that we have

00:15:01.232 --> 00:15:03.800
selective, specific components of mind and brain

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.448
in the first place.

00:15:05.448 --> 00:15:07.459
I mean, it could have been otherwise.

00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:09.900
The brain could have been a single,

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.395
general-purpose processor,

00:15:11.395 --> 00:15:12.867
more like a kitchen knife

00:15:12.867 --> 00:15:14.550
than a Swiss Army knife.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.661
Instead, what brain imaging has delivered

00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:21.507
is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind.

00:15:21.507 --> 00:15:23.970
So we have this picture of very general-purpose

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.040
machinery in our heads

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.397
in addition to this surprising array

00:15:27.397 --> 00:15:30.832
of very specialized components.

00:15:31.712 --> 00:15:33.865
It's early days in this enterprise.

00:15:33.865 --> 00:15:36.641
We've painted only the first brushstrokes

00:15:36.641 --> 00:15:39.568
in our neural portrait of the human mind.

00:15:39.568 --> 00:15:42.650
The most fundamental questions remain unanswered.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.450
So for example, what does each
of these regions do exactly?

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.592
Why do we need three face areas

00:15:48.592 --> 00:15:50.057
and three place areas,

00:15:50.057 --> 00:15:52.925
and what's the division of labor between them?

00:15:52.925 --> 00:15:55.618
Second, how are all these things

00:15:55.618 --> 00:15:57.330
connected in the brain?

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.917
With diffusion imaging,

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:01.096
you can trace bundles of neurons

00:16:01.096 --> 00:16:03.671
that connect to different parts of the brain,

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:05.302
and with this method shown here,

00:16:05.302 --> 00:16:08.999
you can trace the connections of
individual neurons in the brain,

00:16:08.999 --> 00:16:11.717
potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram

00:16:11.717 --> 00:16:13.783
of the entire human brain.

00:16:13.783 --> 00:16:15.830
Third, how does all of this

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.979
very systematic structure get built,

00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:21.935
both over development in childhood

00:16:21.935 --> 00:16:24.747
and over the evolution of our species?

00:16:24.747 --> 00:16:26.647
To address questions like that,

00:16:26.647 --> 00:16:28.430
scientists are now scanning

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.587
other species of animals,

00:16:30.587 --> 00:16:35.973
and they're also scanning human infants.

00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:40.582
Many people justify the high
cost of neuroscience research

00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:43.336
by pointing out that it may help us someday

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:46.793
to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism.

00:16:46.793 --> 00:16:48.740
That's a hugely important goal,

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.961
and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it,

00:16:51.961 --> 00:16:54.959
but fixing things that are broken in the world

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:57.760
is not the only thing that's worth doing.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.988
The effort to understand the human mind and brain

00:17:00.988 --> 00:17:03.806
is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment

00:17:03.806 --> 00:17:05.483
of a single disease.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.520
What could be more thrilling

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.661
than to understand the fundamental mechanisms

00:17:10.661 --> 00:17:12.957
that underlie human experience,

00:17:12.957 --> 00:17:15.883
to understand, in essence, who we are?

00:17:15.883 --> 00:17:19.332
This is, I think, the greatest scientific quest

00:17:19.332 --> 00:17:22.045
of all time.

00:17:22.045 --> 00:17:27.515
(Applause)
