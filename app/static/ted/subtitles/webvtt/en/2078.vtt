00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:02.970
My dream is to build the world's first

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.294
underground park in New York City.

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:07.841
Now, why would someone want
to build an underground park,

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.038
and why in New York City?

00:00:11.038 --> 00:00:12.562
These three tough little buggers

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:15.778
are, on the left, my grandmother, age five,

00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:17.128
and then her sister and brother,

00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:18.666
ages 11 and nine.

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.863
This photo was taken just before they left

00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:23.471
from Italy to immigrate to the United States,

00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:25.982
just about a century ago.

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:27.377
And like many immigrants at the time,

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:29.090
they arrived on the Lower East Side

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.291
in New York City

00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:33.160
and they encountered a crazy melting pot.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.567
What was amazing about their generation

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.627
was that they were not only building new lives

00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:39.750
in this new, unfamiliar area,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.346
but they were also literally building the city.

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:44.479
I've always been fascinated by those decades

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.799
and by that history,

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.278
and I would often beg my grandmother

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:49.947
to tell me as many stories as possible

00:00:49.947 --> 00:00:51.955
about the old New York.

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:54.133
But she would often just shrug it off,

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.383
tell me to eat more meatballs, more pasta,

00:00:56.383 --> 00:00:58.260
and so I very rarely got

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.355
any of the history that I wanted to hear about.

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:02.616
The New York City that I encountered

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:04.514
felt pretty built up.

00:01:04.514 --> 00:01:06.711
I always knew as a kid that I wanted

00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:08.229
to make a difference, and to somehow

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.435
make the world more beautiful, more interesting

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:11.462
and more just.

00:01:11.462 --> 00:01:13.259
I just didn't really know how.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.947
At first, I thought I wanted to go work abroad,

00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:17.366
so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya.

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.481
But it felt weird to me that I knew more about

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:23.115
local Kenyan politics than the
politics of my own hometown.

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:25.121
I took a job with the City of New York,

00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:27.270
but very quickly felt frustrated

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.308
with the slowness of government bureaucracy.

00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:32.013
I even took a job at Google,

00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:35.110
where very fast I drank the Kool-Aid

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.856
and believed almost wholeheartedly

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:40.474
that technology could solve all social problems.

00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:43.960
But I still didn't feel like I was
making the world a better place.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.819
It was in 2009 that my friend

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.787
and now business partner James Ramsey

00:01:47.787 --> 00:01:50.881
alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site,

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:52.331
which is this.

00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:54.166
This is the former trolley terminal

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.744
that was the depot for passengers

00:01:56.744 --> 00:01:58.648
traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge

00:01:58.648 --> 00:02:00.932
from Brooklyn to Manhattan,

00:02:00.932 --> 00:02:03.701
and it was open between 1908 and 1948,

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:06.143
just around the time when my grandparents were

00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:07.992
living right in the area.

00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:09.640
And we learned also that the site

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.882
was entirely abandoned in 1948.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.805
Fascinated by this discovery,

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.933
we begged the authorities to draw us into the space,

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.440
and we finally got a tour,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.590
and this is what we saw.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.300
Now, this photo doesn't really do it justice.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.960
It's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.119
feeling that you have when you get in this space.

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.807
It's a football field of unused land

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:35.210
immediately below a very crowded area of the city,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.345
and it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.060
on an archaeological dig,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.833
and all the details are all still there.

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:42.801
It's really pretty remarkable.

00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:45.401
Now, the site itself is located at the very heart

00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:47.270
of the Lower East Side,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.766
and today it still remains one of the most

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:50.757
crowded neighborhoods in the city.

00:02:50.757 --> 00:02:52.557
New York City has two thirds the green space

00:02:52.557 --> 00:02:54.605
per resident as other big cities,

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:57.778
and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space.

00:02:57.778 --> 00:02:59.601
So we immediately started thinking about how we

00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:01.671
could take this site and turn it into something

00:03:01.671 --> 00:03:03.058
that could be used for the public,

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.810
but also could potentially even be green.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.140
Our plan, in a nutshell,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.841
is to draw natural sunlight underground

00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:12.944
using a simple system that
harvests sunlight above the street,

00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:15.380
directs it below the city sidewalks,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.310
and would allow plants and trees to grow

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.999
with the light that's directed underneath.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.730
With this approach, you could take a site

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.941
that looks like this today

00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:25.707
and transform it into something

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:27.673
that looks like this.

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:31.704
In 2011, we first released some of these images,

00:03:31.704 --> 00:03:33.093
and what was funny was,

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:35.417
a lot of people said to us, "Oh, it kind of looks

00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:37.353
like the High Line underground."

00:03:37.353 --> 00:03:41.673
And so what our nickname ended up becoming,

00:03:41.673 --> 00:03:43.473
and what ended up sticking,

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.319
was the Lowline, so the Lowline was born.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.996
What was also clear was that people really wanted

00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:49.694
to know a lot more about how the technology

00:03:49.694 --> 00:03:51.260
would look and feel,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.393
and that there was really much more interest in this

00:03:53.393 --> 00:03:55.488
than we had ever thought possible.

00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:57.727
So, like a crazy person, I decided to quit my job

00:03:57.727 --> 00:03:59.921
and focus entirely on this project.

00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:01.743
Here is us with our team

00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:04.151
putting together a technology demonstration

00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:06.170
in a warehouse.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.270
Here's the underbelly of this solar canopy

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.599
which we built to show the technology.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.479
You can see the six solar collectors at the center there.

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.090
And here's the full exhibit all put together

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.541
in this warehouse.

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:20.318
You can see the solar canopy overhead,

00:04:20.318 --> 00:04:21.734
the light streaming in,

00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:24.358
and this entirely live green space below.

00:04:24.358 --> 00:04:25.784
So in the course of just a few weeks,

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:29.353
tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit,

00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:30.810
and since that time, we've grown

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.111
our numbers of supporters both locally

00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:35.823
and among design enthusiasts all over the world.

00:04:35.823 --> 00:04:37.884
Here's a rendering of the neighborhood

00:04:37.884 --> 00:04:40.250
just immediately above the Line's site,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.384
and a rendering of how it will look

00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:44.668
after major redevelopment that is coming

00:04:44.668 --> 00:04:46.671
over the course of the next 10 years.

00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:48.786
Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels

00:04:48.786 --> 00:04:50.710
and how there's really a lack of green space.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.430
So what we're proposing is really something that will

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.180
add one football field of green space

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.046
underneath this neighborhood, but more importantly

00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:02.760
will introduce a really community-driven focus

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.943
in a rapidly gentrifying area.

00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:06.687
And right now, we're focusing very closely

00:05:06.687 --> 00:05:09.106
on how we engage with the City of New York

00:05:09.106 --> 00:05:12.549
on really transforming the overall ecosystem

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:14.630
in an integrated way.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.239
Here's our rendering of how we would actually

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:18.377
invite people into the space itself.

00:05:18.377 --> 00:05:20.683
So here you see this iconic entrance

00:05:20.683 --> 00:05:22.855
in which we would literally peel up the street

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:25.870
and reveal the historical layers of the city,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.775
and invite people into this warm underground space.

00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:31.034
In the middle of winter, when it's
absolutely freezing outside,

00:05:31.034 --> 00:05:32.124
the last place you'd want to go would be

00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:34.634
an outdoor space or outdoor park.

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:36.559
The Lowline would really be a four-season space

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.045
and a respite for the city.

00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:41.363
So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings

00:05:41.363 --> 00:05:43.984
my own family's story full circle.

00:05:43.984 --> 00:05:45.918
If my grandparents and my parents were really

00:05:45.918 --> 00:05:49.205
focused on building the city up and out,

00:05:49.205 --> 00:05:51.281
I think my generation is focused on reclaiming

00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:53.189
the spaces that we already have,

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.146
rediscovering our shared history,

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.724
and reimagining how we can make our communities

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:00.737
more interesting, more beautiful and more just.

00:06:00.737 --> 00:06:02.706
Thanks.

00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:04.437
(Applause)
