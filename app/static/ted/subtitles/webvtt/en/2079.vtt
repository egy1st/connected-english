00:00:00.087 --> 00:00:01.451
(Applause)

00:00:01.855 --> 00:00:04.781
I should have died 30 years ago.

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:07.124
I am a survivor.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.852
One of thousand Argentinean conscripts,

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:14.115
non-professional
soldiers, sent to fight

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.568
a war that should have
never took place.

00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:23.631
I spent 60 days
surviving in a frozen well,

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:27.555
under infrahuman conditions,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.834
alongside my mate Roberto,

00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:37.381
without solid food,
and I lost 20 kilos of body weight.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.682
We, clearly, had three enemies:

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.781
the weather, the British,
and, sadly our own chiefs,

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:53.256
who treated us
with a disdain for human condition

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:56.293
that was hard to understand.

00:00:59.897 --> 00:01:06.729
Of course, faced with such hard scenario,

00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:11.432
where we did not know
if we were going to survive

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:13.932
the malnutrition and maltreatment,

00:01:14.806 --> 00:01:18.701
strengths began to grow out of nowhere.

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:24.082
We started making decisions.
Taking decisions in order not to die.

00:01:24.574 --> 00:01:28.336
There was not much to do
but we began to do it,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.797
to work on the day-to-day.

00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:37.875
Simple things like keeping the well
as little wet as possible,

00:01:39.404 --> 00:01:42.142
also, to run away to town, 10 kilometers,

00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:46.662
to try to look
in the islanders' garbage bins,

00:01:46.686 --> 00:01:49.086
or to break into a warehouse in despair.

00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:51.532
And 10 kilometers back.

00:01:51.557 --> 00:01:55.874
We ceased to do that for two reasons,

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.831
calorie expenditure was huge
and we found just few things,

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:05.086
and punishment was inhuman.

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:08.334
If we were caught
they would stretch us out.

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.788
The "stretch out" was
a crucifixion to the ground,

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:13.819
wrists and ankles tied,

00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:18.511
with the jacket open, like animals,

00:02:18.558 --> 00:02:19.782
during hours.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:24.191
I saw at least 15 to 20 of my mates
in that condition,

00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:26.543
for stealing food.

00:02:29.803 --> 00:02:33.330
In this picture, quite shocking,

00:02:33.354 --> 00:02:38.075
you can see my fellow survivors
from the company.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.802
They had to deal with the worse.
They had take on the worse of the offense.

00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:49.841
Ghosts. Town dwellers
who saw us in those conditions,

00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:54.897
years later we came to know
that they called us "the zombies".

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.993
All heroes, all survivors, all brothers.

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:05.799
I learned a lot through that experience,

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:09.403
I learned to be more humble,

00:03:10.053 --> 00:03:13.541
I learned to listen
and to ask to be listened.

00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:17.872
I learned to appreciate
each thing with great intensity.

00:03:19.848 --> 00:03:24.447
And above all, I started discovering

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:26.871
strengths I did not even imagine I had.

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:34.805
But learning-wise,
one of the most interesting ones

00:03:35.413 --> 00:03:38.194
happened upon the end,

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.294
when the British were taking us back
as war prisoners,

00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:44.635
on this transatlantic,
the Canberra, to Madryn.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.699
I spent one week on board.

00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:55.237
I was the translator,
and what happened there

00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:58.610
was an amazing anthropological study.

00:03:58.635 --> 00:04:01.855
4122 Argentinean prisoners
guarded by those same British

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.957
with whom we had been killing each other
the previous week.

00:04:08.225 --> 00:04:10.814
A surrealistic experience.

00:04:10.838 --> 00:04:14.800
Before getting on board,
when I got to know the British were there,

00:04:14.824 --> 00:04:18.355
I thought, "We are in trouble,
we are going to beat each other to death."

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:23.234
But I was greatly surprised
when shortly afterwards

00:04:23.928 --> 00:04:28.769
I was translating conversations
between the Argentinean and the British,

00:04:28.808 --> 00:04:33.808
polite conversations,
filled with curiosity,

00:04:33.832 --> 00:04:36.929
regarding how it had been
on the other side.

00:04:39.394 --> 00:04:40.919
Conversations on music.

00:04:40.944 --> 00:04:44.121
We listened to Pink Floyd and Genesis,
and so they did as well.

00:04:44.146 --> 00:04:51.230
And that was the music on the ship,
what we listened to on the loudspeakers.

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:56.639
There I learned a big lesson:

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.821
I learned it would be impossible
to fight the enemy

00:04:59.846 --> 00:05:04.785
once you get to know them,
once it ceases to be anonymous,

00:05:06.012 --> 00:05:08.845
and that the enemy is always anonymous.

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:12.870
I also thought that
if one could put together

00:05:12.894 --> 00:05:15.941
groups of young people
from countries in conflict,

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.808
so they could get to meet and talk,
like we Argentinean and British were doing

00:05:21.832 --> 00:05:23.553
on that ship,

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:30.066
there would be less wars in the world
and less young people entering the army.

00:05:31.847 --> 00:05:34.811
The things to do
on the ship were intensive,

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.846
I'd go over the ship translating,

00:05:40.822 --> 00:05:45.520
and even helping at the surgery room,
which was impressing.

00:05:48.143 --> 00:05:50.803
I covered the story,

00:05:50.827 --> 00:05:54.287
when I got back from the war,
I did not talk for 20 years.

00:05:54.803 --> 00:06:00.778
Until 2001 with the economic crisis,
the Argentinean catastrophe of 2001.

00:06:01.303 --> 00:06:04.237
I had a shop in Venado Tuerto,

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:07.327
Santa Fe, where I live.

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:12.825
And I was, like millions of Argentinians,
suffering from great stress,

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.787
and in that setting
I had my first combat nightmare,

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:19.204
I had never dreamed.

00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:24.862
I dreamed I was
in a well with my mates,

00:06:25.744 --> 00:06:29.836
the morning of June 12,
the British had already taken the summit,

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.389
and tons of hot iron, mortars and cannons

00:06:32.413 --> 00:06:33.813
are raining on us.

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.115
And everything is shaking
like in a earthquake,

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:40.396
there are two dead mate
outside who did not make it inside,

00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:43.451
there is Roberto with splinters
in his hip and gut,

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:47.787
the final acceleration of the projectiles
is deafening,

00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:51.802
I begin to pray.

00:06:51.827 --> 00:06:53.755
All this is taking 8 hours,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.844
from 8 am until 4 pm,

00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:59.327
it feels as though vehicles
are pouring from the sky,

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:01.607
and I couldn't stop trembling.

00:07:01.632 --> 00:07:04.432
I begin to pray
as though saying goodbye to this world,

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:06.041
my friends join me.

00:07:07.298 --> 00:07:08.919
And while praying,

00:07:08.953 --> 00:07:12.286
images from my family in slow motion
come to my mind,

00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:14.517
playing with my grandmother,
with my mother,

00:07:15.549 --> 00:07:17.839
and in that moment, inside that nightmare,

00:07:17.863 --> 00:07:19.854
my cell phone rings.

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.839
It was the bank manager telling me:
"Miguel I have to close your account,

00:07:24.864 --> 00:07:27.511
you have too many bounced checks."

00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:33.161
On that day I realized
I could no longer hide,

00:07:34.034 --> 00:07:35.835
and I looked for help.

00:07:36.303 --> 00:07:37.782
I started talking,

00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:41.862
for two years
under psychological treatment,

00:07:42.956 --> 00:07:46.170
then to talk, and well,
I ended up writing a book.

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:51.785
But memories, the nightmare
did not come alone,

00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:56.164
it came along with all the post traumatic
stress disorder symptoms

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:57.776
that one may think of.

00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:59.990
I was quite depressed,
I lost a lot of weight,

00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:02.926
and I had intrusive images for two years,

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.817
recurrent memories that will not stop.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.382
But as when in the well,
where with Roberto

00:08:12.406 --> 00:08:15.473
we started making everyday decisions,

00:08:15.709 --> 00:08:19.351
at that moment
when I thought I was losing my mind,

00:08:19.383 --> 00:08:21.837
I started working
on a day to day basis as well,

00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:23.343
and to get better.

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:26.644
The things I've done may seem funny,

00:08:26.668 --> 00:08:28.794
I used to cry in the morning,

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.152
and I even had dreams
where I killed myself.

00:08:32.756 --> 00:08:35.039
And in those moments
I pushed myself out of bed,

00:08:35.063 --> 00:08:39.263
I went running, swimming,

00:08:39.288 --> 00:08:42.801
acting lessons, massage,
reiki, Bach flowers,

00:08:42.826 --> 00:08:44.815
even a healing priest.

00:08:45.588 --> 00:08:48.777
But at the end of the day I realized,
like in the well,

00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:51.790
that I had to take charge of my own life.

00:08:52.143 --> 00:08:58.404
And it was then
when I started to feel better.

00:08:59.023 --> 00:09:04.851
I knew that in that healing path
I had to go through,

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:06.832
that I have already began to tread,

00:09:06.856 --> 00:09:09.819
it was necessary to go back to that place,
to the Islands.

00:09:09.843 --> 00:09:11.875
Life made me meet James Peck,

00:09:13.004 --> 00:09:17.496
a brother in life,
a person that changed my life.

00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:20.815
James is here with us,
he is very shy,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.858
he doesn't want to be pointed out,
but he is with us.

00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:30.787
He came to Buenos Aires
with those paintings,

00:09:31.121 --> 00:09:34.792
he had painted all the pain
we the Argentinean had undergone,

00:09:34.816 --> 00:09:37.382
he had captured it on canvas

00:09:37.406 --> 00:09:40.739
and we were part of his own ghosts.

00:09:42.208 --> 00:09:45.827
Life made us brothers,
James is a very brave person,

00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:50.822
he is a free person
with independent thinking,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.817
James received the Argentinean ID
from the President last year,

00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:56.835
I had the honor to be with him.

00:09:57.449 --> 00:10:00.134
But what James did not tell me
on that first trip,

00:10:00.261 --> 00:10:02.498
when I wnet back with all my family,

00:10:02.882 --> 00:10:06.904
was that his father,
Terry Peck, had fought against me.

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:11.821
Terry had been the one who guided

00:10:11.846 --> 00:10:13.916
the Brtitish soldiers to where we were,

00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:16.488
and ended up fighting
few meters aways from us.

00:10:16.513 --> 00:10:18.238
I met him in 2000,

00:10:18.897 --> 00:10:21.467
an incredible person.

00:10:22.691 --> 00:10:26.058
We visited the battle fields together,

00:10:26.082 --> 00:10:29.023
we showed each other where we had fought,

00:10:30.705 --> 00:10:34.618
we made a tost
to the memory of our dead mates,

00:10:34.658 --> 00:10:37.062
and we found common ground,

00:10:37.087 --> 00:10:41.901
because we had fought against each other
in an unnecessary war.

00:10:42.804 --> 00:10:46.188
And we also exchanged berets,
as you can see in this photograph.

00:10:47.426 --> 00:10:50.997
I remember him dearly.
Terry passed away 6 years ago,

00:10:52.243 --> 00:10:54.694
and I am sure that
if he were watching this,

00:10:54.718 --> 00:10:57.291
he would be smiling like in that photo.

00:10:59.561 --> 00:11:02.774
One of the most moving events

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:05.457
in this story took place
during the last days of combat.

00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:09.803
I went as an interpreter as well,

00:11:09.827 --> 00:11:11.865
they ordered me to go on a patrol

00:11:11.889 --> 00:11:14.970
to a little house in a farm

00:11:14.994 --> 00:11:18.965
that was allegedly broadcasting
to the fleet.

00:11:19.836 --> 00:11:23.345
We set out quite early,
everything was frozen,

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.575
the frost was appalling,

00:11:24.604 --> 00:11:26.636
and we were quite undernourished,

00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:29.166
we got dizzy with every movement,

00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:30.874
my rifle was heavy.

00:11:31.318 --> 00:11:33.403
We got to the house as dying men.

00:11:33.665 --> 00:11:36.570
At this point, the beginning of June,

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:41.841
a mate of us died from hypothermia
and undernourishment,

00:11:41.865 --> 00:11:44.274
before the British arrived.

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:48.783
Other four set foot on a mine
in one of those hikes I also took,

00:11:48.807 --> 00:11:50.782
and they died as well.

00:11:51.457 --> 00:11:55.799
Other five or six fired themselves
in their feet in order to be evacuated.

00:11:55.823 --> 00:11:59.820
That was the desperate situation
in which I arrive to that little house,

00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:04.803
and upon arrival
I began eating desperately,

00:12:05.844 --> 00:12:08.803
and screamed in English
if there was anybody there.

00:12:08.827 --> 00:12:12.858
The first thing that called my attention
was the smell of that house,

00:12:12.883 --> 00:12:15.341
a scent quite familiar.

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:18.657
And a very nice English pullover
called my attention,

00:12:18.682 --> 00:12:21.713
I put it close to my nose
and I was connected with my own home.

00:12:22.793 --> 00:12:26.380
I felt as thought there was somebody
in that house watching over me saying:

00:12:26.405 --> 00:12:29.460
"Just a bit longer, Miguel,
you're coming back, you'll be fine."

00:12:30.051 --> 00:12:34.511
When I left with that pullover
with which I felt stronger,

00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:35.807
it gave me protection.

00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:39.858
I thought: I am going to come back here
one day, and I'll talk to these people.

00:12:40.433 --> 00:12:43.685
Life give me that amazing opportunity,
25 years later.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.784
I gave it back to Lisa,
the pullover was from his father.

00:12:48.535 --> 00:12:51.470
She said: "My dad died
because of the stress of this war,

00:12:51.495 --> 00:12:52.660
a few years later,"

00:12:52.684 --> 00:12:54.842
and I answered: "So did my mother".

00:12:55.873 --> 00:12:58.103
It was a sublime moment,

00:12:58.128 --> 00:13:00.739
we had tea together, and when leaving,

00:13:00.763 --> 00:13:03.844
John, one of the Island dwellers,
in his four-wheel drive,

00:13:03.868 --> 00:13:05.840
while crossing the river,

00:13:05.864 --> 00:13:08.840
said something that filled my heart:

00:13:08.864 --> 00:13:12.491
"Feel proud of yourself, Miguel,
you are building bridges."

00:13:12.803 --> 00:13:15.139
(Applause)

00:13:24.185 --> 00:13:27.423
I think that is a key component
in every human relationship,

00:13:27.448 --> 00:13:30.172
to build less walls and more bridges.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.654
When we arrived to La Plata's regiment,

00:13:35.678 --> 00:13:37.883
while coming back, the military
gave us a rally

00:13:37.908 --> 00:13:39.795
they made us sign sworn declarations

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.870
so that we wouldn't tell anything,

00:13:41.894 --> 00:13:45.551
and all the families were outside
desperately waiting for news,

00:13:45.584 --> 00:13:48.074
and the families of dead soldiers
were receiving

00:13:48.099 --> 00:13:50.100
elusive information from the military.

00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:52.409
They told them they would arrive
the next day,

00:13:52.434 --> 00:13:53.850
and they were dead.

00:13:53.874 --> 00:13:58.778
That memory breaks my heart,
and from here I send a hug to all of them.

00:13:58.802 --> 00:14:01.015
Those families have suffered too much.

00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:04.306
So I meet with my brother in the crowd,

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.804
who had also jumped
from the regiment's wall,

00:14:06.828 --> 00:14:10.783
he takes me to the car
where my parents were,

00:14:10.807 --> 00:14:15.097
and I went running along
that cobbled road in La Plata,

00:14:15.122 --> 00:14:17.145
in the cold, in June,

00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:20.875
and I hear my mother's screams,

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:24.804
and I could barely see her,
I saw like an aura,

00:14:24.828 --> 00:14:27.780
and I dive into her trembling arms.

00:14:28.548 --> 00:14:30.371
It was an amazing moment,

00:14:30.395 --> 00:14:33.595
it was the most moving moment of my life.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.605
And when the hard moments of my life
come to mind,

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:38.778
this moment always comes,

00:14:38.802 --> 00:14:40.815
and in happy moments as well.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:43.366
It's like a virgin accompanying me.

00:14:44.812 --> 00:14:48.833
When I got back,

00:14:48.857 --> 00:14:52.577
my body was decimated,
I had lost 20 kilos,

00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:55.485
my teeth were loose
because of the scurvy,

00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:57.793
my neck thin, I was flesh and bones,

00:14:57.817 --> 00:15:01.729
the soles of my feet with necrosis
because of the ice,

00:15:03.834 --> 00:15:09.082
and so I entered a state that nowadays
I deem as "the survivor's euphoria".

00:15:09.811 --> 00:15:13.845
I would set the alarm clock early,
even though I had nothing to do,

00:15:13.869 --> 00:15:15.808
in order to enjoy life.

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:19.633
I'd go out, my body decimated,

00:15:19.658 --> 00:15:22.751
but with such strength
and such happiness of being alive,

00:15:22.943 --> 00:15:26.400
and I'd go out into the streets
and everything would thrill me,

00:15:26.424 --> 00:15:28.491
the smell of grass recently cut,

00:15:28.846 --> 00:15:30.290
the singing of birds,

00:15:30.314 --> 00:15:33.776
even TV colors seemed thrilling.

00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:38.875
And people visiting would say:
"You are different, you are better,"

00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:41.854
and would reply: "Of course I am better."

00:15:41.878 --> 00:15:44.298
But at that moment I did not know
how to explain it,

00:15:44.323 --> 00:15:45.819
it was the survivor's euphoria.

00:15:45.843 --> 00:15:49.818
They threw a party at home
with friends and family.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.825
Have you watched "Castaway"
with Tom Hanks?

00:15:52.849 --> 00:15:56.665
When he comes back from the island,
they throw him a party,

00:15:56.816 --> 00:15:58.595
it was exactly the same.

00:15:58.892 --> 00:16:02.137
I was in another state of mind,
I had come from a spiritual retreat,

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:04.183
and I had come with all those teachings,

00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:08.847
which aren't learned in many lives,
nor at any university.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.518
I had come with that strength
and felt very strong,

00:16:15.922 --> 00:16:19.844
and at that party everybody
was drinking and talking loudly,

00:16:19.869 --> 00:16:22.908
and I wanted to be alone.
I went to the kitchen

00:16:24.122 --> 00:16:28.607
and turned on the burners,
and while warming my hands,

00:16:28.631 --> 00:16:30.354
I started to think inwardly:

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:32.536
You will have to keep this strength

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.672
because no matter
how much love they'd give,

00:16:35.697 --> 00:16:38.803
they will find it hard to understand
your story in depth,

00:16:38.828 --> 00:16:42.264
you are going to be alone
with these memories all your life.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:48.658
And I thought as well: if I am able
to freeze this survivor's euphoria,

00:16:48.682 --> 00:16:52.937
this appreciation of simple things
that I am feeling now,

00:16:54.176 --> 00:16:58.115
because I saw all those people
living lethargic lives,

00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:01.299
stressed by material stuff,

00:17:01.619 --> 00:17:03.356
even bored,

00:17:04.214 --> 00:17:07.820
and I was with all this learning
and was conscious

00:17:07.845 --> 00:17:11.810
that in being aware
of how beautiful life is,

00:17:11.834 --> 00:17:15.609
I was going to find my main handicap,
my strength,

00:17:15.635 --> 00:17:17.779
and that my life was going
to be different,

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:19.737
I was going to live a happier life.

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:29.194
After 30 years,
that conviction remains intact,

00:17:29.741 --> 00:17:32.266
the survivor's euphoria stayed,

00:17:32.797 --> 00:17:37.827
and I feel very proud,
I am filled with emotion

00:17:37.861 --> 00:17:39.761
for having come today to share

00:17:39.786 --> 00:17:42.803
my survivor's euphoria with you all.

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:43.880
Thank you very much.

00:17:43.905 --> 00:17:45.089
(Applause)
