00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
"Jó napot, pacák" Which,
as somebody here must surely know,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
means "What's up, guys?" in Magyar,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that peculiar non-Indo-European
language spoken by Hungarians

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
for which, given the fact
that cognitive diversity is

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
at least as threatened
as biodiversity on this planet,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
few would have imagined much
of a future even a century or two ago.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But there it is: "Jó napot, pacák"

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I said somebody here must
surely know, because

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.334
despite the fact that there aren't
that many Hungarians to begin with,

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:34.334
and the further fact that, so far
as I know, there's not a drop

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:38.000
of Hungarian blood in my veins,
at every critical juncture of my life

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
there has been a Hungarian friend
or mentor there beside me.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.286
I even have dreams that take
place in landscapes

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.000
I recognize as the landscapes
of Hungarian films,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
especially the early
movies of Miklos Jancso.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So, how do I explain this
mysterious affinity?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Maybe it's because my native
state of South Carolina,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which is not much smaller
than present-day Hungary,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
once imagined a future for itself
as an independent country.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And as a consequence of that presumption,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
my hometown was burned
to the ground by an invading army,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
an experience that has befallen
many a Hungarian town and village

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
throughout its long and troubled history.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Or maybe it's because when
I was a teenager back in the '50s,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
my uncle Henry -- having
denounced the Ku Klux Klan

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and been bombed for his trouble
and had crosses burned in his yard,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
living under death threat -- took his wife
and children to Massachusetts for safety

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and went back to South Carolina
to face down the Klan alone.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That was a very Hungarian thing to do,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
as anyone will attest who remembers 1956.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And of course, from time
to time Hungarians

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.239
have invented
their own equivalent of the Klan.

00:01:48.263 --> 00:01:55.000
Well, it seems to me that this
Hungarian presence in my life

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is difficult to account for, but ultimately
I ascribe it to an admiration

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
for people with a complex moral awareness,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
with a heritage of guilt and defeat
matched by defiance and bravado.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It's not a typical mindset
for most Americans,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
but it is perforce typical
of virtually all Hungarians.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So, "Jó napot, pacák!"

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I went back to South Carolina
after some 15 years amid the alien corn

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
at the tail end of the 1960s,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
with the reckless
condescension of that era

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
thinking I would save my people.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Never mind the fact that they were slow
to acknowledge they needed saving.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I labored in that vineyard
for a quarter century before

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
making my way to a little kingdom
of the just in upstate South Carolina,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
a Methodist-affiliated institution
of higher learning called Wofford College.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I knew nothing about Wofford

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and even less about Methodism,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but I was reassured on the first day
that I taught at Wofford College

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.096
to find, among the auditors
in my classroom,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.000
a 90-year-old Hungarian, surrounded
by a bevy of middle-aged European women

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.620
who seemed to function
as an entourage of Rhinemaidens.

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:08.000
His name was Sandor Teszler.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
He was a puckish widower
whose wife and children were dead

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and whose grandchildren lived far away.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
In appearance, he resembled
Mahatma Gandhi,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
minus the loincloth,
plus orthopedic boots.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
He had been born in 1903 in the provinces

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
in what later would become Yugoslavia.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
He was ostracized as a child,
not because he was a Jew --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
his parents weren't very
religious anyhow --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
but because he had been born
with two club feet,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
a condition which, in those days,
required institutionalization

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and a succession of painful operations
between the ages of one and 11.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
He went to the commercial business
high school as a young man

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
in Budapest, and there
he was as smart as he was modest

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and he enjoyed a considerable success.
And after graduation

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
when he went into textile
engineering, the success continued.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
He built one plant after another.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
He married and had two sons. He
had friends in high places who

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
assured him that he was of great
value to the economy.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Once, as he had left
instructions to have done,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
he was summoned in the middle of the night
by the night watchman at one of his plants.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
The night watchman had caught
an employee who was stealing socks --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
it was a hosiery mill, and he simply
backed a truck up to the loading dock

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and was shoveling in mountains of socks.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Mr. Teszler went down to the plant
and confronted the thief and said,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
"But why do you steal from me? If you
need money you have only to ask."

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The night watchman, seeing how things
were going and waxing indignant,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
said, "Well, we're going to call
the police, aren't we?"

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But Mr. Teszler answered, "No,
that will not be necessary.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
He will not steal from us again."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Well, maybe he was too trusting,
because he stayed where he was

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
long after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and even after the arrests
and deportations began in Budapest.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
He took the simple precaution of having
cyanide capsules placed in lockets

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that could be worn about the necks
of himself and his family.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And then one day, it happened:
he and his family were arrested

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and they were taken to a death
house on the Danube.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
In those early days of the Final
Solution, it was handcrafted brutality;

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
people were beaten to death
and their bodies tossed into the river.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But none who entered that death
house had ever come out alive.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And in a twist you would not believe
in a Steven Spielberg film --

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the Gauleiter who was overseeing this
brutal beating was the very same thief

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
who had stolen socks
from Mr. Teszler's hosiery mill.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
It was a brutal beating. And
midway through that brutality,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
one of Mr. Teszler's sons,
Andrew, looked up and said,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
"Is it time to take
the capsule now, Papa?"

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And the Gauleiter, who afterwards
vanishes from this story,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
leaned down and whispered
into Mr. Teszler's ear,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
"No, do not take the capsule.
Help is on the way."

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And then resumed the beating.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.239
But help was on the way,
and shortly afterwards

00:06:01.263 --> 00:06:04.000
a car arrived from the Swiss Embassy.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
They were spirited to safety. They
were reclassified as Yugoslav citizens

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and they managed to stay
one step ahead of their pursuers

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
for the duration of the War,
surviving burnings and bombings

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.381
and, at the end of the War,
arrest by the Soviets.

00:06:17.405 --> 00:06:21.000
Probably, Mr. Teszler had gotten
some money into Swiss bank accounts

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
because he managed to take
his family first to Great Britain,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.239
then to Long Island and then to the center
of the textile industry in the American South.

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:33.000
Which, as chance would have it,
was Spartanburg, South Carolina,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the location of Wofford College.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And there, Mr. Teszler began all over again
and once again achieved immense success,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
especially after he invented the process

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
for manufacturing a new
fabric called double-knit.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And then in the late 1950s, in the aftermath
of Brown v. Board of Education,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
when the Klan was resurgent
all over the South,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Mr. Teszler said, "I have
heard this talk before."

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And he called his top
assistant to him and asked,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
"Where would you say, in this
region, racism is most virulent?"

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
"Well, I don't rightly know, Mr. Teszler.
I reckon that would be Kings Mountain."

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
"Good. Buy us some land in Kings Mountain

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and announce we are going
to build a major plant there."

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
The man did as he was told,
and shortly afterwards,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Mr. Teszler received a visit
from the white mayor of Kings Mountain.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Now, you should know that at that time,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the textile industry in the South
was notoriously segregated.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
The white mayor visited
Mr. Teszler and said,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.429
"Mr. Teszler, I trust you’re going
to be hiring a lot of white workers."

00:07:39.453 --> 00:07:43.000
Mr. Teszler told him, "You bring me
the best workers that you can find,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.239
and if they are good
enough, I will hire them."

00:07:45.263 --> 00:07:50.000
He also received a visit from the leader
of the black community,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
a minister, who said, "Mr. Teszler,
I sure hope you're going to

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.524
hire some black workers
for this new plant of yours."

00:07:54.548 --> 00:07:58.000
He got the same answer: "You bring
the best workers that you can find,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and if they are good
enough, I will hire them."

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.477
As it happens, the black minister did
his job better than the white mayor,

00:08:04.477 --> 00:08:05.477
but that's neither here or there.

00:08:05.477 --> 00:08:09.000
Mr. Teszler hired 16 men:
eight white, eight black.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
They were to be his seed
group, his future foremen.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
He had installed the heavy
equipment for his new process

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
in an abandoned store
in the vicinity of Kings Mountain,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and for two months these 16 men
would live and work together,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
mastering the new process.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
He gathered them together
after an initial tour of that facility

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and he asked if there were any questions.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.429
There was hemming and hawing
and shuffling of feet,

00:08:30.453 --> 00:08:33.453
and then one of the white workers
stepped forward and said,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
"Well, yeah. We’ve looked at this place
and there's only one place to sleep,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
there's only one place to eat,
there's only one bathroom,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
there's only one water fountain. Is this
plant going to be integrated or what?"

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Mr. Teszler said, "You are being paid twice the wages
of any other textile workers in this region

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and this is how we do business.
Do you have any other questions?"

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
"No, I reckon I don't."

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And two months later when
the main plant opened

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.143
and hundreds of new
workers, white and black,

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:05.477
poured in to see the facility
for the first time,

00:09:05.501 --> 00:09:11.000
they were met by the 16 foremen, white
and black, standing shoulder to shoulder.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
They toured the facility and were asked
if there were any questions, and

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
inevitably the same question arose:

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
"Is this plant integrated or what?"

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And one of the white foremen
stepped forward and said,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
"You are being paid twice
the wages of any other workers

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
in this industry in this region
and this is how we do business.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Do you have any other questions?"

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And there were none. In one fell swoop,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Mr. Teszler had integrated the textile
industry in that part of the South.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
It was an achievement
worthy of Mahatma Gandhi,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer
and the idealism of a saint.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
In his eighties, Mr. Teszler, having
retired from the textile industry,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
adopted Wofford College,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
auditing courses every semester,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and because he had a tendency
to kiss anything that moved,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
becoming affectionately known as "Opi"
-- which is Magyar for grandfather --

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
by all and sundry. Before I got
there, the library of the college

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
had been named for Mr. Teszler,
and after I arrived in 1993,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
the faculty decided to honor itself by naming
Mr. Teszler Professor of the College --

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
partly because at that point
he had already taken

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
all of the courses in the catalog,
but mainly because

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
he was so conspicuously
wiser than any one of us.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
To me, it was immensely reassuring
that the presiding spirit

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
of this little Methodist college
in upstate South Carolina

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
was a Holocaust survivor
from Central Europe.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Wise he was, indeed, but he also
had a wonderful sense of humor.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And once for an interdisciplinary class,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I was screening the opening segment
of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal."

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
As the medieval knight Antonius Block
returns from the wild goose chase

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
of the Crusades and arrives
on the rocky shore of Sweden,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
only to find the specter
of death waiting for him,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Mr. Teszler sat in the dark
with his fellow students. And

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
as death opened his cloak
to embrace the knight

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
in a ghastly embrace, I heard
Mr. Teszler's tremulous voice:

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
"Uh oh," he said, "This doesn't
look so good." (Laughter)

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But it was music that was his greatest
passion, especially opera.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And on the first occasion
that I visited his house, he gave me

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
honor of deciding what piece
of music we would listen to.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And I delighted him by rejecting
"Cavalleria Rusticana"

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
in favor of Bela
Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle."

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I love Bartok's music, as did Mr. Teszler,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and he had virtually every recording
of Bartok's music ever issued.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.620
And it was at his house
that I heard for the first time

00:11:48.644 --> 00:11:51.000
Bartok's Third Piano
Concerto and learned from

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Mr. Teszler that it had been composed
in nearby Asheville, North Carolina

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
in the last year of the composer's life.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
He was dying of leukemia and he knew it,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and he dedicated this
concerto to his wife,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Dita, who was herself a concert pianist.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And into the slow, second movement,
marked "adagio religioso,"

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
he incorporated the sounds
of birdsong that he heard

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
outside his window in what he knew
would be his last spring;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
he was imagining a future for her
in which he would play no part.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And clearly this composition
is his final statement to her --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
it was first performed after his death --

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and through her to the world.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And just as clearly, it is saying,
"It's okay. It was all so beautiful.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Whenever you hear this, I will be there."

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
It was only after Mr. Teszler's death
that I learned

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
that the marker on the grave of Bela
Bartok in Hartsdale, New York

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
was paid for by Sandor Teszler.
"Jó napot, Bela!"

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Not long before Mr. Teszler’s
own death at the age of 97,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
he heard me hold forth on human iniquity.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.381
I delivered a lecture
in which I described history

00:13:10.405 --> 00:13:14.000
as, on the whole, a tidal wave
of human suffering and brutality,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and Mr. Teszler came up to me afterwards
with gentle reproach and said,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
"You know, Doctor, human beings
are fundamentally good."

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And I made a vow
to myself, then and there,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
that if this man who had such
cause to think otherwise

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.334
had reached that conclusion,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I would not presume to differ
until he released me from my vow.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And now he's dead, so
I'm stuck with my vow.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
"Jó napot, Sandor!"

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I thought my skein of Hungarian
mentors had come to an end,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
but almost immediately I met Francis
Robicsek, a Hungarian doctor --

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
actually a heart surgeon in Charlotte, North
Carolina, then in his late seventies --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.143
who had been a pioneer
in open-heart surgery,

00:14:02.167 --> 00:14:06.000
and, tinkering away
in his garage behind his house,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
had invented many of the devices
that are standard parts of those procedures.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
He's also a prodigious art collector,
beginning as an intern in Budapest

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
by collecting 16th- and 17th-century
Dutch art and Hungarian painting,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and when he came to this country
moving on to Spanish colonial art,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Russian icons and finally Mayan ceramics.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
He's the author of seven books,
six of them on Mayan ceramics.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
It was he who broke the Mayan
codex, enabling scholars to relate

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
the pictographs on Mayan ceramics
to the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
On the occasion of my first
visit, we toured his house

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and we saw hundreds
of works of museum quality,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and then we paused in front of a closed
door and Dr. Robicsek said,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
with obvious pride, "Now
for the piece De resistance."

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And he opened the door
and we walked into a

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
windowless 20-by-20-foot room
with shelves from floor to ceiling, and

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
crammed on every shelf
his collection of Mayan ceramics.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.477
Now, I know absolutely nothing
about Mayan ceramics,

00:15:06.477 --> 00:15:09.477
but I wanted to be as ingratiating
as possible so I said,

00:15:09.477 --> 00:15:13.000
"But Dr. Robicsek, this
is absolutely dazzling."

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
"Yes," he said. "That
is what the Louvre said.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
They would not leave me alone
until I let them have a piece,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
but it was not a good one." (Laughter)

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Well, it occurred to me
that I should invite Dr. Robicsek

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
to lecture at Wofford
College on -- what else?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
-- Leonardo da Vinci. And further,
I should invite him to meet

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
my oldest trustee, who had majored
in French history at Yale

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
some 70-odd years before and,
at 89, still ruled the world's

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
largest privately owned textile
empire with an iron hand.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
His name is Roger Milliken.
And Mr. Milliken agreed,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and Dr. Robicsek agreed.
And Dr. Robicsek visited

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and delivered the lecture
and it was a dazzling success.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And afterwards we convened
at the President's House with Dr. Robicsek

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
on one hand, Mr. Milliken on the other.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.143
And it was only at that moment,
as we were sitting down to dinner,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.715
that I recognized the enormity
of the risk I had created,

00:16:08.739 --> 00:16:12.000
because to bring these two titans,
these two masters of the universe

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
together -- it was like introducing Mothra
to Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.143
If they didn't like each other,
we could all get trampled to death.

00:16:20.143 --> 00:16:22.143
But they did, they did like each other.

00:16:22.143 --> 00:16:25.000
They got along famously
until the very end of the meal,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and then they got into a furious argument.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And what they were arguing about was this:

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
whether the second Harry Potter movie
was as good as the first. (Laughter)

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Mr. Milliken said it was not.
Dr. Robicsek disagreed.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I was still trying to take
in the notion that these titans,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.667
these masters of the universe, in their spare
time watch Harry Potter movies,

00:16:46.691 --> 00:16:50.000
when Mr. Milliken thought
he would win the argument by saying,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
"You just think it's so good
because you didn't read the book."

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And Dr. Robicsek reeled back in his chair,
but quickly gathered his wits,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.191
leaned forward and said, "Well,
that is true, but I'll bet you went

00:17:00.215 --> 00:17:05.000
to the movie with a grandchild." "Well,
yes, I did," conceded Mr. Milliken.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
"Aha!" said Dr. Robicsek. "I went to the movie
all by myself." (Laughter) (Applause)

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And I realized, in this
moment of revelation,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
that what these two men were
revealing was the secret

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
of their extraordinary success,
each in his own right.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And it lay precisely
in that insatiable curiosity,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
that irrepressible desire to know,
no matter what the subject,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
no matter what the cost,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
even at a time when the keepers
of the Doomsday Clock

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.096
are willing to bet even money
that the human race won't be around

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.000
to imagine anything in the year
2100, a scant 93 years from now.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
"Live each day as if it
is your last," said Mahatma Gandhi.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
"Learn as if you'll live forever."

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
This is what I'm passionate about.
It is precisely this.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:03.000
It is this inextinguishable, undaunted
appetite for learning and experience,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.191
no matter how risible,
no matter how esoteric,

00:18:05.215 --> 00:18:08.000
no matter how seditious it might seem.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
This defines the imagined futures
of our fellow Hungarians --

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Robicsek, Teszler and Bartok
-- as it does my own.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
As it does, I suspect,
that of everybody here.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
To which I need only add, "Ez
a mi munkank; es nem is keves."

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
This is our task; we know it will be hard.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
"Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves.
Jó napot, pacák!" (Applause)
