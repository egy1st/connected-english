00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.908
I'd like to ask you
to raise your hand if you believe

00:00:03.943 --> 00:00:06.943
that the image behind me is a work of art.

00:00:08.706 --> 00:00:10.745
There's not much room for doubt, is there?

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.780
What about this other one?

00:00:13.415 --> 00:00:16.636
It could impress us more or less,
depending on our aesthetic tastes,

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:20.124
but nobody will be horrified by the sight
of a Mondrian in a museum.

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:24.842
What happens if I show you a urinal?

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:26.426
Here come the first doubts.

00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:27.847
It's not just any urinal.

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:31.263
'Fountain', presented by Duchamp
for entry into an art exhibition

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:34.295
where all works of art
were to be accepted.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.708
And this one was left out.

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.929
The other commissioners charged
with deciding what would be included

00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:40.592
left it aside.
Duchamp gave up.

00:00:40.627 --> 00:00:44.951
A conceptual, irreverent,
politically incorrect work of art.

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:47.617
Because sometimes art
can be all these things too.

00:00:47.652 --> 00:00:50.646
What about this one?

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:55.582
A box of washing powder,
and not even a real one. A replica.

00:00:55.617 --> 00:00:57.789
But what if I told you it's a Warhol?

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.747
The faces are starting to change.

00:00:59.782 --> 00:01:01.224
A name with value.

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:04.929
Another work of art,
a 20th-century avant-garde icon.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:09.051
In this case, art which talks to us
about what is happening,

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:13.252
about commercial art
versus art of the elite. Why?

00:01:13.287 --> 00:01:15.336
Because art isn't always pretty.

00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:16.985
Art isn't always a canvas.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.124
In fact, in its origins art
was much more than that.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.278
Art was a ritual.
Art was politics, it was communication.

00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:27.702
That's why art can sometimes be fleeting,
it can be brutal,

00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:30.033
it can horrify us, like Marina Abramovic

00:01:30.068 --> 00:01:32.528
and her 'Performances'
which seek to move us,

00:01:32.563 --> 00:01:34.570
which seek to comment, to tell a story;

00:01:34.605 --> 00:01:38.675
which are political, social
and at times religious declarations.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.841
Or art can team up with science
and create a rabbit like Alba,

00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:48.001
a fluorescent rabbit who sparked debate
over whether her true 'parent'

00:01:48.036 --> 00:01:51.845
was the artist Eduardo Kac
or the laboratory which commissioned her.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.008
Is this a breakthrough?
Is it a work of art?

00:01:54.043 --> 00:02:01.621
With this in mind, who would say
that a picture like this could be art?

00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:06.146
That maybe video gaming
is one of the new avant-garde art forms.

00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:07.948
Just like Duchamp in his day.

00:02:07.983 --> 00:02:09.961
Or like Warhol in his.

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:14.255
And it's not me who's saying this,
nor a group of fanaticized geeks

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.815
who play video games 24/7

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.176
and who know all the tricks in the book.

00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:21.665
No, this is something
that is happening worldwide.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.902
And which is being validated
by institutions:

00:02:23.937 --> 00:02:26.542
institutions of art and of technology;

00:02:26.577 --> 00:02:28.203
and museums, like the Smithsonian,

00:02:28.228 --> 00:02:30.917
which this year dedicated
a several-month long exhibition

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:33.465
to the history of video gaming,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.584
the cultural influence of video gaming.

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.713
The decision of which works
were to be included in the exhibition

00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:40.292
went to the public themselves.

00:02:40.317 --> 00:02:43.666
Or, for example, a museum of technology
like the one in Berlin.

00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:47.683
It has a wing dedicated
solely to video games.

00:02:47.718 --> 00:02:51.132
From the first console up
to modern-day productions

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:55.590
made by artists
who work with gaming devices.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:57.641
And why not festivals too?

00:02:57.676 --> 00:03:02.050
Like ARS Electronica,
a festival which takes place in Austria

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:04.733
and which is characteristic
of art and technology.

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:07.153
It has a category called Interactive Art

00:03:07.178 --> 00:03:10.024
which for a while has been assigning
awards to video games.

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.177
Commercial video games,
independent video games,

00:03:13.212 --> 00:03:15.593
devices created by artists.

00:03:15.618 --> 00:03:18.177
These are all different ways
in which the video game

00:03:18.212 --> 00:03:20.493
can come to be considered as an art.

00:03:20.518 --> 00:03:23.300
I'm not saying that all of them
are art, but some are.

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:26.424
And it happens,
and it was inevitable that it would happen

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.603
because art is something unique to man.

00:03:28.628 --> 00:03:30.936
Art is a way
we have of expressing ourselves,

00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:33.565
of communicating,
of transmitting emotions.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.790
Art keeps on changing with the ages;

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:39.155
with each society it uses different tools.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.844
Technology was inevitable in this century

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.536
and video gaming
is one of the many faces it can assume.

00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:50.424
And these are some
of the many faces behind these creations.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.099
These people could be the next Warhols.

00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:55.049
They are the ones who walk among us.

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:59.555
We are the ones who will say:
"Yes, this could be art", or "No",

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.925
and time will tell
if we were right or wrong.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.483
I suggest we take a quick look
at six examples of video games

00:04:06.518 --> 00:04:09.231
which are probably not quite Mona Lisas,

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:12.548
or Warhol's Brillo Boxes,

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:16.682
but which are paving
the way for what is to come.

00:04:16.716 --> 00:04:20.858
Perhaps the easiest art form
to liken it to is cinema.

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:22.980
The video game goes one step further,

00:04:23.015 --> 00:04:24.876
from the seventh art to the eighth.

00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:26.712
Now we have interactivity,

00:04:26.737 --> 00:04:28.704
something which some branches of art

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.133
has been striving for since
it left the canvas.

00:04:31.158 --> 00:04:34.014
To remove the other
from the place of the observer,

00:04:34.049 --> 00:04:36.244
to hook them in,
to make them the protagonist.

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:38.562
By its very nature, video gaming
has all of this.

00:04:38.587 --> 00:04:41.863
Take Assassin's Creed, for example:
a 'mainstream' video game

00:04:41.898 --> 00:04:44.983
which could be outdone
by the more 'indie' ones

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:47.024
but which has a lot going on
behind it all.

00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:49.642
It took three years of work,
500 people developing it,

00:04:49.677 --> 00:04:52.036
departments dedicated to photography,

00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:54.472
to character design, to narrative.

00:04:54.507 --> 00:04:56.984
Here, Renaissance Italy
has been reconstructed.

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:59.303
They worked with historians, architects,

00:04:59.338 --> 00:05:01.642
specialists in this era.

00:05:01.677 --> 00:05:05.433
It's the only method we have today
to explore these places.

00:05:05.468 --> 00:05:08.921
A while ago there was an exhibition
in the Museum of Decorative Art

00:05:08.956 --> 00:05:10.890
on paintings from that period.

00:05:10.925 --> 00:05:15.655
Line after interminable line
waiting for a glance into that time.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.529
It's the same thing here.
We're being taken along for a journey

00:05:19.564 --> 00:05:22.941
where we are the ones
who travel through the story.

00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:25.371
We are the protagonists of this tale.

00:05:25.406 --> 00:05:29.641
And just like Hollywood
has a flipside like Cannes festival

00:05:29.676 --> 00:05:33.251
or Berlin's Golden Bear, with entries
which try to tell another story,

00:05:33.286 --> 00:05:36.181
transmit another experience,
which have multiple meanings;

00:05:36.206 --> 00:05:38.022
video games have that too,

00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:41.594
with companies which present themselves
as purely artistic.

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:45.605
This is the case with That Game Company,
a Californian enterprise

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.280
which says it develops video games
which are like interactive poems.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:52.710
This is its most recent work, Journey.

00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:56.090
The journey of the hero,
present in every narrative.

00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:58.676
Every book and every film
talks about this journey.

00:05:58.711 --> 00:06:01.029
Perhaps a journey unique to each player.

00:06:01.064 --> 00:06:04.503
We wake up in the desert,
alone in the vast emptiness

00:06:04.538 --> 00:06:07.529
with nobody to keep us company,
and a light to follow.

00:06:07.564 --> 00:06:11.041
In Journey, the meaning
will be different for every player.

00:06:11.076 --> 00:06:14.221
You enter into a painting,
you enter into a poem.

00:06:14.256 --> 00:06:16.546
You are the one
who walks among the verses.

00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:21.284
And sometimes another character appears,
which is someone who is online

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.925
at that precise moment,
who is undertaking their own journey,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.223
their own destiny,

00:06:26.258 --> 00:06:29.468
and who connects with us through sound.

00:06:29.503 --> 00:06:31.280
We don't have a familiar language,

00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:33.370
we can't chat, we just emit sounds.

00:06:33.405 --> 00:06:35.951
We sing, we communicate,
we keep each other company.

00:06:35.976 --> 00:06:39.817
And when the other player disappears,
he takes away a little token...

00:06:39.852 --> 00:06:42.643
and we're left alone
to continue our journey.

00:06:42.678 --> 00:06:45.683
All fairly sensible up to here, it seems.

00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:48.240
It's aesthetic, we understand it.
It's not so crazy.

00:06:48.265 --> 00:06:52.525
But what happens if we get
just a little more experimental?

00:06:52.568 --> 00:06:56.116
Daniel Benmergui, Argentinian.
Works with narrative.

00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:58.541
How do we tell a story?

00:06:58.576 --> 00:07:02.384
In this instance, he takes up the theories
of the Russian constructivists.

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:04.250
He picked on the nobodies.

00:07:04.285 --> 00:07:10.026
This storyteller won
the Nuovo Award in the IGF,

00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:14.075
the Independent Games Festival, this year.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.650
The prize par excellence
for experimentation in a video game.

00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:22.205
In a comic-strip style,
he sets out a storytelling for us.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.633
In this case, Adam has to die.

00:07:24.668 --> 00:07:26.452
We have Adam and a tombstone.

00:07:26.487 --> 00:07:28.832
If we put Adam in the first frame

00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:32.531
and the tombstone in the second,
Adam goes 'kaput'.

00:07:32.566 --> 00:07:37.566
Sometimes it is inspired by cinema,
such as Indecent Proposal, for example

00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:40.657
Here we have a happy couple,
but if we add a treasure chest,

00:07:40.657 --> 00:07:42.740
the couple will break up.

00:07:42.765 --> 00:07:46.361
Our protragonist's decision is up to us:

00:07:46.396 --> 00:07:48.476
whether he will choose love or money.

00:07:48.511 --> 00:07:49.820
It's all experimentation.

00:07:49.855 --> 00:07:53.875
It may or may not seem like art,
we'll see, but it is happening.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.660
And art, as we said before,
can also be political.

00:07:57.695 --> 00:08:01.190
Art can have a strong message to convey.

00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:05.344
At one point, muralists in Mexico
went out into the streets;

00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:07.831
they went out into the streets to talk
about politics,

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:10.488
to educate and make people
aware of what was happening.

00:08:10.513 --> 00:08:14.607
Here, Gonzalo Frasca from Uruguay
presents us with September 12th,

00:08:14.642 --> 00:08:17.526
inspired by the events of September 11th.

00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:21.035
He puts us in a random town
in the Middle East.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.486
Civilians walking around,
and some of them are armed.

00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:28.185
A telescopic sight, and no objectives.
There are no rules.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.163
It's down to us to decide what to do.

00:08:30.188 --> 00:08:32.917
Our first instinct is to kill the bad guy.

00:08:32.952 --> 00:08:35.284
But what happens is that we shoot

00:08:35.318 --> 00:08:37.785
and in the missile blast, there
will be casualties

00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:40.191
who did not have to be the ones to die.

00:08:40.226 --> 00:08:43.207
The civilians will gather to mourn
their dead relatives

00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:46.446
and they too will become terrorists.

00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:49.409
Violence breeds violence, it's simple.

00:08:49.444 --> 00:08:52.761
But being told this is not the same
as being fully aware,

00:08:52.796 --> 00:08:56.245
as becoming responsible
for these actions ourselves.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.411
'Serious games', games
which are related to social reality,

00:09:00.446 --> 00:09:01.921
to what is happening to us.

00:09:01.946 --> 00:09:04.306
Video gaming moving towards education,

00:09:04.341 --> 00:09:08.386
video gaming as a tool to connect us
with the younger ones,

00:09:08.421 --> 00:09:11.554
who are practically born
with joysticks in their hands these days.

00:09:11.579 --> 00:09:16.102
Or, an experimental video game
developed in this case by a musician.

00:09:16.137 --> 00:09:21.658
Deep Sea, a diving suit,
a gas mask which isolates us completely

00:09:21.693 --> 00:09:24.838
from our surroundings,
and a pair of earphones.

00:09:24.873 --> 00:09:26.530
We are at the bottom of the sea.

00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:29.168
Our mission is to escape
from the savage beasts

00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:30.745
which are pursuing us.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.907
Our resources are a joystick
and the sounds we hear.

00:09:35.426 --> 00:09:36.771
It's about the experience.

00:09:36.796 --> 00:09:39.796
At one point when art
came out of the canvas,

00:09:39.821 --> 00:09:42.390
it started to work with the body,
with emotions,

00:09:42.425 --> 00:09:44.195
with feelings and sensations;

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.877
the 'performances' and the 'happenings'
began to appear.

00:09:46.902 --> 00:09:49.717
Creating movement,
appealing to other sensitivities.

00:09:49.752 --> 00:09:52.836
Marta Minujín is an icon over here,

00:09:52.871 --> 00:09:55.192
you'll probably have heard of 'Mayhem',

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:58.479
where you would walk through
a kind of scenario where things happen.

00:09:58.504 --> 00:10:01.138
It was a step beyond the visual.

00:10:01.173 --> 00:10:03.957
It meant entering into the experience
with your whole body.

00:10:03.982 --> 00:10:07.139
But we were still witnesses.
Here, we are protagonists.

00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:10.461
On top of this, new possibilities arise

00:10:10.486 --> 00:10:13.523
for people with sight problems,
for example.

00:10:13.558 --> 00:10:16.010
The idea is simply to start working

00:10:16.045 --> 00:10:18.586
with all these capacities we possess.

00:10:18.621 --> 00:10:23.385
Finally, Pain Station,
developed by artists.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.916
In their university graduation thesis

00:10:26.951 --> 00:10:29.739
they come back to Pong,
one of the first video games.

00:10:29.774 --> 00:10:32.535
A game of ping-pong.
You have your hands ready

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.417
to play table tennis on a tablet.

00:10:35.452 --> 00:10:37.589
The problem is that
for every ball we miss,

00:10:37.624 --> 00:10:40.375
for each shot we can't return,

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.454
the second hand placed on the board
will receive a punishment.

00:10:44.489 --> 00:10:46.633
They get burned, they receive lashings.

00:10:46.668 --> 00:10:50.784
This game is on display
in the museum of Berlin

00:10:50.819 --> 00:10:54.548
as a contemporary development
of artists working with video games.

00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:58.729
At the limits of what is ethical,
the limits of gaming, the limits of art.

00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:02.134
But this is the idea,
to push the boundaries.

00:11:02.169 --> 00:11:06.370
And it is important to bear in mind
that all of these proposals

00:11:06.405 --> 00:11:08.455
are bringing back the value of games.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.622
Something which perhaps we had put aside,

00:11:10.657 --> 00:11:13.951
which we thought was for children,
but isn't for children.

00:11:13.986 --> 00:11:16.061
Games are for grown-ups too.

00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:17.270
Games can be serious.

00:11:17.305 --> 00:11:20.386
Games laid the foundations
for all cultures and societies.

00:11:20.421 --> 00:11:22.861
Games make us socialize,

00:11:22.896 --> 00:11:24.858
they make us connect with others.

00:11:25.135 --> 00:11:28.629
And games, on the artistic side,
can take certain liberties.

00:11:28.664 --> 00:11:31.472
They can explore, they can experiment,
they can be risky,

00:11:31.507 --> 00:11:35.558
irreverent, provide new experiences,
open doors.

00:11:35.593 --> 00:11:37.059
That's what this is about.

00:11:37.094 --> 00:11:40.262
To be attentive, not to sit tight
in our comfort zones,

00:11:40.297 --> 00:11:42.304
yearning for bygone ages and better times

00:11:42.339 --> 00:11:44.640
when we understood everything we saw.

00:11:44.675 --> 00:11:46.739
Not to be stuck
like Woody Allen's character

00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:49.791
in Midnight in Paris
dreaming about travelling through time.

00:11:49.826 --> 00:11:53.910
Realizing that all around us,
change is starting to happen,

00:11:53.945 --> 00:11:58.170
that it's up to us to wake up
this internal curiosity,

00:11:58.205 --> 00:12:00.544
to change our viewpoint,
start seeing again.

00:12:00.579 --> 00:12:03.722
That there are
fundamental changes happening,

00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:06.935
that video games are one
of the possible new faces of this change.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.547
And perhaps this is an easy way
to come closer to this idea.

00:12:10.582 --> 00:12:13.089
I invite you all to return to play.

00:12:13.124 --> 00:12:14.325
(Applause)
