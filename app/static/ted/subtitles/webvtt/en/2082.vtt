00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
What are the causes of death in males?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.476
The leading cause of death in males

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.755
are cardiovascular diseases.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.352
And women know this,

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:16.678
because we women take care
of our men throughout life.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.476
And we also know why they get sick.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.476
A few years ago, through a program
of the Argentinean Heart Foundation,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.090
we conducted a survey
on a representative sample

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:31.924
of 600 women from the metropolitan area

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.876
of Buenos Aires,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.094
on the basis of risk factors.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.429
And 80% of the women knew
that conditions such as:

00:00:45.454 --> 00:00:48.476
high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
diabetes or smoking,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.936
increase the risk
of cardiovascular disease.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:57.475
And 90% of respondents
knew that chest pain

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
is a warning sign of a heart attack.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.722
As well, most of them
had information about

00:01:03.747 --> 00:01:07.016
behaviors that help prevent or control

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:08.957
heart disease.

00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:12.070
Then, we asked them:

00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:15.335
“What is the leading cause
of death in females?”

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:21.179
As you can see, more than half of them
said that cancer is.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500
Particularly breast cancer.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
However, what do women actually die of?

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.476
In Argentina, 1 of 3 women
die of cardiovascular diseases.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.873
More deaths than
if we add up the ones from

00:01:40.897 --> 00:01:43.500
all types of cancers, accidents and HIV.

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:49.466
This data is collected
by the Ministry of Health,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.674
and shows that, since 2007,

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:57.945
more women than men have died
of cardiovascular disease.

00:01:58.912 --> 00:02:00.827
Today, 135 women.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.249
And another one in the next 11 minutes.

00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:08.476
I am a cardiologist who, since 2006,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.921
has been committed to fighting
two realities:

00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:19.476
The first one: without doubt,
cardiovascular disease

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.176
represents a major health issue for women.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.919
The second one: most women
ignore that information

00:02:28.944 --> 00:02:34.890
and have a perception
that differs widely from reality.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.976
Cardiovascular disease risk factors,
such as diabetes, high blood pressure,

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:45.965
sedentary lifestyle, stress, overweight;
are the same for both?

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.476
It seems so; however,
this is not necessarily true.

00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:53.476
If we talk overweight, it is not the same
in women than in men.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.461
In men, fat concentrates in the belly;

00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:58.703
whereas in women,

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:00.763
it settles around the hips.

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:03.764
And for the heart, the fat settling
around the hips

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:05.765
may be healthier than abdominal fat.

00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:10.476
On the other hand,
the impact risk factors have

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.500
also differs by gender.

00:03:13.342 --> 00:03:15.476
For example: diabetes.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.476
Diabetes is a risk factor
for both men and women.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.476
If a man has diabetes, the risk of having
a heart attack is 2.6 times higher

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.500
than for the one who does not have.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:34.475
However, a woman with diabetes
is 4 times more likely to have

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.500
a heart attack than a woman
who does not have.

00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:43.936
The same applies to high blood pressure
or sedentary lifestyle,

00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:47.742
both increase the risks of heart attack
much more in women than in men.

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:50.568
On the contrary,
the harmful effects of smoking

00:03:50.593 --> 00:03:53.959
are slightly worse in men than in women.

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:59.410
And the third point about risk factors
in women is that

00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:03.919
there may be conditions in women alone

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:06.476
that may increase
the risk of heart disease,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.111
that we don't know about.

00:04:08.136 --> 00:04:10.476
This is because, in the past,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.476
cardiovascular diseases
were studied only in men.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.476
And extrapolating the results
from men to women

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.500
could be a mistake.

00:04:20.754 --> 00:04:24.315
Just like studying women
may bring along surprises.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.476
Let me give you an example:

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.476
many may have heard that women
of childbearing age are less likely

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.887
to suffer illnesses because of the effect
of sex hormones;

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:43.168
a protection that we lose after menopause.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.840
Well, for many years, women were treated

00:04:46.865 --> 00:04:50.054
with hormone replacement therapy.

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:53.475
They were treated with hormone patches

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.500
as a hormone replacement therapy.

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.365
However, only research studies
involving thousands of women

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.641
treated with hormone replacement therapy
for many years,

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:08.022
demonstrated that
far from protecting the heart,

00:05:08.047 --> 00:05:11.517
it increased cardiovascular risk.

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:15.284
Certainly, what kills us women
is replacement,

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:17.309
and that is a scientific evidence.

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:21.762
But it is a good one, because
it shows that women

00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:24.364
need to be studied in particular.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.476
Today, the medicine is fundamentally
based on clinical trials,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.476
and even today, women remain
underrepresented

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.476
in research studies.

00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:41.793
But this is something we can change.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.111
I can show you data on heart failure,

00:05:46.136 --> 00:05:49.849
or any of cardiovascular diseases.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:53.476
The percentage of women
in research studies,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.017
treated, in this case,
by heart-failure medication,

00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:58.128
is less than 30%.

00:05:58.153 --> 00:06:00.503
When in fact, if you measure
the entire population

00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:03.440
suffering heart failure,
more than half are women.

00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:08.111
At the beginning,
I talked about the symptoms

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.594
and I'd like to dra
your attention to this:

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:14.476
If the symptoms also differ

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.054
between men and women.

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:18.777
And I will talk about heart attack.

00:06:20.094 --> 00:06:25.780
The most common heart attack symptom
is chest pain, the squeezing one,

00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:29.780
described over 200 years ago by a man

00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:32.476
based on direct observation of men,

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.616
and read by men.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.476
But there are “atypical” symptoms,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.887
as opposed to the typical,

00:06:40.912 --> 00:06:43.475
And those are: back pain, nausea, fatigue,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.763
and a feeling of fullness.

00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:50.500
A priori, we could relate “atypical”
with “odd” or “unusual”.

00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:54.597
Well, almost half of women
who have a heart attack

00:06:55.497 --> 00:06:57.500
have atypical symptoms.

00:07:01.205 --> 00:07:06.475
And if the description of the heart attack

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.379
had been made over men and women,

00:07:08.404 --> 00:07:11.641
the atypical would be identified as

00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:13.770
“female”…

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:21.475
The fact is that the challenge entailed

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.667
in that typicality of the symptoms,

00:07:24.692 --> 00:07:26.692
brings significant consequences.

00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:31.475
And that is the case
even when women have typical symptoms,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.500
which can make it difficult to diagnose.

00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:39.377
A man enters the emergency room
with a heart attack,

00:07:39.402 --> 00:07:41.475
usually saying:

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.253
“I have a chest pain, squeezing me

00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:46.476
as If I had an elephant's foot
standing in the middle of my chest."

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.884
And we all rush. The standard.

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:52.744
But many women describe
the symptoms in a different way.

00:07:52.769 --> 00:07:56.476
They use a description associated
with feelings, such as:

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.476
“I experience some kind of anxiety,
as if I needed to sigh…"

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.476
And so no rush.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.946
Because it’s a more complex description.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.922
And it’s crucial to be very clear
when facing stroke.

00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:13.476
Because, when the flow of blood stops,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.092
the artery clogs abruptly

00:08:17.117 --> 00:08:20.500
and stops feeding the heart muscle.

00:08:20.838 --> 00:08:24.476
And for every minute of delay
in opening up that artery,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.223
the greater the potential damage
to the heart.

00:08:27.247 --> 00:08:30.476
And, clearly, higher probability of death.

00:08:31.068 --> 00:08:32.500
Every minute counts.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.476
And something that is usually taken
as common sense,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.847
but also demonstrated scientifically,

00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:43.720
is that those who felt sick enough
and rushed to the hospital,

00:08:43.745 --> 00:08:47.278
are the ones who, when they started
to feel sick realized that

00:08:47.303 --> 00:08:51.110
they were having a heart attack.

00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:53.137
And the mental picture is facilitated by

00:08:53.162 --> 00:08:55.633
the recognition of the early symptoms
and the belief

00:08:55.658 --> 00:08:58.889
that what you are experiencing
is possible happen.

00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:02.476
And the latter is
only possible if you know

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.213
you can get sick.

00:09:06.864 --> 00:09:09.293
Let me tell you about Loli.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.476
I met her many years ago

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.476
when she was admitted
in hospital with a stroke.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.476
Loli started feeling sick

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.500
while in a cab, very close
to the hospital.

00:09:24.071 --> 00:09:26.475
But she decided to go home instead

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.806
"so as not to worry her husband".

00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:32.500
And because she was a teacher
and had to mark exams.

00:09:33.024 --> 00:09:35.475
Since she felt, as many women,
that she had

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.476
many family responsibilities
that she could not delegate.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.819
And she thought the discomfort
should go away.

00:09:40.844 --> 00:09:44.476
Because in the end, she never imagined
that what she way suffering

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.110
was having a stroke.

00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:48.503
Loli’s case is no exception.

00:09:48.527 --> 00:09:52.476
In Argentina, a study demonstrated that,
on average, women ask doctors

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.536
2 hours later than men.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.500
What it means less chance of survival.

00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:03.825
Another case.

00:10:05.555 --> 00:10:08.476
Ana María. She was in her car, stopped

00:10:08.501 --> 00:10:10.327
at a traffic light,

00:10:10.352 --> 00:10:13.476
when a truck carrying frozen food,

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.476
hit the back of her car.

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:20.476
She gets out of the car, somewhat shocked.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.821
No serious injuries though.

00:10:23.603 --> 00:10:28.317
When she realizes the damages,
she starts arguing with the truck driver

00:10:28.342 --> 00:10:31.261
and as they were arguing,
she starts experiencing chest pain.

00:10:31.286 --> 00:10:35.019
Shortly after the ambulance arrived;
she is given a Philadelphia collar

00:10:35.044 --> 00:10:38.476
and taken to the hospital
where she kept describing a chest pain.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.476
So to rule out injuries related
to the accident,

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.500
she was taken X-rays and CT.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.958
What I say is merely speculative, but

00:10:50.982 --> 00:10:54.475
if Ana Maria had been
a man taken to a hospital ER

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.169
with symptomatic effects
of hyper-acute stress

00:10:58.194 --> 00:11:00.526
for a street accident
and suffering a chest pain,

00:11:00.551 --> 00:11:03.953
it is pretty sure that
she would had been referred by the doctors

00:11:03.978 --> 00:11:06.566
to undergo an electrocardiography,
to rule out a stroke

00:11:06.591 --> 00:11:08.194
before being taken to X-ray.

00:11:08.714 --> 00:11:13.476
Thus, having patients delaying
in consulting a physician,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.476
as well as the delays
within the health system,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.476
and the difficulty in making diagnosis

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.269
because of this atypicality,

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:29.008
entails that women receive
less treatment for heart attack

00:11:29.032 --> 00:11:32.475
in Argentina, but also
in the rest of the world.

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:38.023
And an avoidable consequence is that

00:11:38.332 --> 00:11:43.476
the fact that they receive
less treatment explains why,

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.476
to some extent, more women
die of a stroke than

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.500
men suffering a stroke.

00:11:51.008 --> 00:11:54.476
Therefore, it is imperative that we,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.476
the medical and scientific community,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.500
step up clinical research in women

00:12:00.642 --> 00:12:04.475
in order to provide and assure them

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.500
the best treatment
and health care available.

00:12:08.195 --> 00:12:11.312
We have another point and
is related to the community,

00:12:11.337 --> 00:12:13.503
to raise awareness.

00:12:15.171 --> 00:12:20.500
If you, women and also you men,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.476
are convinced that women
can get heart disease,

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.476
this may have two important consequences.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.476
The first one has to do with prevention:

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.476
and it is that women
adopt healthy behaviors,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.476
visit a doctor on a regular basis,

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.500
and be aware of
their vascular risk factors.

00:12:44.939 --> 00:12:48.476
And that men starts taking care
of their women’s heart

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.476
just as women care about

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.012
our men’s hearts.

00:12:54.132 --> 00:12:57.476
And the second outcome is
that women, given the chance

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.476
they may have something,
consult a doctor right away,

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.500
Because that can save their life.

00:13:05.036 --> 00:13:08.606
Months ago,

00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:13.196
I was having an after-meal conversation
with friends,

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.476
and at that moment, I was working
on an awareness campaign,

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.476
and I was very excited about the idea that

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.805
a simple campaign can save lives,

00:13:26.507 --> 00:13:28.476
but someone told me:

00:13:28.501 --> 00:13:33.054
"You can't expect others
to dream your dream."

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.891
And I deeply hope he was wrong.

00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:43.476
So I ask all of you to please help us,

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.380
committing yourself
to spreading this message:

00:13:46.405 --> 00:13:50.575
The heart of a woman
may break SERIOUSLY

00:13:51.055 --> 00:13:52.095
