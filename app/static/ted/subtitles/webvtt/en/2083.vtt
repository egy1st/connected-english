WEBVTT

00:00:00.515 --> 00:00:01.595
(Applause)

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:03.222
A dream made true.

00:00:04.222 --> 00:00:08.198
You'll notice in my voice,
as soon as I calm down,

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:13.222
that I have a somehow weird accent,
as I've lived in Spain for twelve years.

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:25.198
Twelve years ago I went to Paris
for 15 days to receive a literary award

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:30.222
and I met a Catalan girl there,
and I stayed to live with her.

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:39.222
Back in Argentina I had a job, a house,
and no intentions of moving whatsoever.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.198
While in Spain I had nothing:
no house, no job, not even papers

00:00:46.222 --> 00:00:48.222
to get a house and a job.

00:00:49.222 --> 00:00:56.198
Even worse, after living
8-9 months in Spain

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.222
only because I was in love,

00:01:00.428 --> 00:01:04.221
two horrible things happened in Argentina.
First came the 2001 crisis,

00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:08.198
4-5 presidents in one week
and social chaos.

00:01:08.222 --> 00:01:13.222
And, even worse, around the same time,
Racing won the soccer championship.

00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:21.198
I am a Racing fan. It's horrible seeing
your team champion for the first time

00:01:21.222 --> 00:01:23.198
while being away...

00:01:23.222 --> 00:01:27.198
Far away from your land,
but in my case, from my father,

00:01:27.222 --> 00:01:29.198
with whom we'd always thought

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.941
we'd see this event,
if it ever happened, together.

00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:35.198
These two circumstances,
the economic crisis in Argentina

00:01:35.222 --> 00:01:39.198
and my team winning the title,
happened at the same time

00:01:39.222 --> 00:01:43.555
and taught me what I didn't have
the slightest idea could ever happen:

00:01:44.222 --> 00:01:48.596
that pain and party,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.197
tragedy and triumph are the same

00:01:51.222 --> 00:01:52.979
when you're away.

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:56.910
Not being able to cry with your loved ones
when something horrible happens,

00:01:56.935 --> 00:02:00.198
or celebrate with your people
when something wonderful happens

00:02:00.222 --> 00:02:04.690
puts you immediately offside.

00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:09.163
As I was in Spain sad and alone,
I had the idea to create a blog

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.198
and I started writing.

00:02:12.222 --> 00:02:15.198
I named that blog Orsai,

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:21.276
that means in soccer jargon in Spanish
that you are offside, off the game,

00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:24.222
that you're not allowed to play.

00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:29.291
In those times I used the Internet
mainly to send emails

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.896
and to chat with my friends from Mercedes.

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:35.949
So what happened when I created
that blog was a huge surprise for me

00:02:35.973 --> 00:02:38.528
and I imagine it was so
for everyone else at the time.

00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:42.973
I started writing short stories,
sometimes as myself,

00:02:43.488 --> 00:02:47.940
or disguised as different characters;
a housewife, a seer, a princess.

00:02:48.755 --> 00:02:51.012
And little by little it started
to get crowded.

00:02:51.162 --> 00:02:56.198
People from weird countries: Honduras,
Nicaragua,from Spain or from here.

00:02:56.222 --> 00:03:02.222
And so Orsai turned into a kind
of involuntary community of readers.

00:03:03.222 --> 00:03:06.198
I did nothing to gather them, I mean,

00:03:06.222 --> 00:03:08.198
I didn't put banners in my blog saying:

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:11.198
"Come in, feel comfortable,
generate a community".

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:14.198
The only thing I did was
writing short stories,

00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:18.198
I also read the comments
the readers made to those tales

00:03:18.222 --> 00:03:22.198
and also, most of the time,
I chatted with them.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:28.008
When that community got even bigger
because of word of mouth,

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:30.198
and specially became more fervent,

00:03:30.992 --> 00:03:34.595
some traditional companies
related to culture and media

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.420
started to listen
to this babble of voices.

00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:40.325
"Look, there's a guy who writes
and people are there."

00:03:41.016 --> 00:03:43.710
And so my phone started ringing,

00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:46.934
they offered me to work with them.

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:50.087
The publishing companies
proposed me to make books

00:03:50.112 --> 00:03:52.584
with the stories I wrote
for free on the Internet

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.100
and the press invited me to write
columns in their newspapers,

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:58.674
similar to the kind of stuff
I wrote on the Internet.

00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:03.198
I know this now, I didn't know back then.

00:04:03.682 --> 00:04:07.065
I think I made a rather serious mistake.

00:04:07.605 --> 00:04:09.967
I went to work with the industry,

00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:13.748
I ended the direct communication
with my readers

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:19.197
and I let them put me intermediaries,
an agent, a publisher

00:04:19.221 --> 00:04:23.198
a manager, a content editor.

00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:28.197
All those people lined up
between me and my readers.

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:36.047
The publishing companies also asked me,
for the publication of my first book,

00:04:36.072 --> 00:04:40.198
to take away all those free articles
from the Internet so they could sell them.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.198
The situation got a bit tense there
because I told them immediately

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:48.428
I couldn't do such thing for
I had given those texts as presents,

00:04:48.453 --> 00:04:51.705
and I couldn't go house by house
asking every reader if, please,

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.285
I could get the gift back
because now I wanted

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.079
to sell it through white collar guys.

00:04:56.556 --> 00:05:01.579
But it became worse as books
and time went by,

00:05:01.604 --> 00:05:05.858
that permanent feeling
that the publishers were robbing me.

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:10.558
One time they closed the sales
one of my pocketbooks.

00:05:10.582 --> 00:05:14.198
It's an anecdote I always tell
and I think it's descriptive.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.198
they stated to have sold about 900 copies
in Argentina of a pocketbook

00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:24.198
and I knew, because I'm a close friend
of a bookseller from Mercedes,

00:05:24.222 --> 00:05:28.673
one of the three bookstores in Mercedes,
I knew that 750 had been sold

00:05:28.698 --> 00:05:30.197
in a small bookstore

00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:37.198
of a town of Buenos Aires province.

00:05:39.332 --> 00:05:43.808
And it wasn't just the feeling
of being robbed at gunpoint,

00:05:43.832 --> 00:05:47.118
the impossibility of checking
sales and printing.

00:05:47.142 --> 00:05:51.198
I also started receiving a lot of emails
from readers of the blog

00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:54.198
telling me my books were not available
in their countries.

00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:58.578
The industry distributes books in Spanish
only where it is profitable:

00:05:58.603 --> 00:06:03.236
Argentina, Spain, Mexico,

00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:06.896
but if a Salvadoran or a Peruvian
wants my book,

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:10.598
they have no choice...
They will never get it.

00:06:10.622 --> 00:06:13.702
With the press I was going through
something similar.

00:06:14.094 --> 00:06:17.070
They asked me articles 400-words long,

00:06:17.095 --> 00:06:19.197
but if there was half a page
of advertising,

00:06:19.222 --> 00:06:23.536
the editor called me to tell me that
this week my column was 200-word long.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.198
When the European economic crisis came
and the companies

00:06:27.222 --> 00:06:30.236
stopped advertising in newspapers,

00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:32.847
I thought "Now I'll be able to go back
to 400 words".

00:06:32.872 --> 00:06:36.198
But no, they removed a sheet
from the newspaper and left me with 150.

00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:41.987
Last year, when these issues
started to get worse,

00:06:42.012 --> 00:06:46.198
I got very tired and publicly broke up
with the publishing companies

00:06:46.222 --> 00:06:48.564
Mondadori from Italy,
Plaza &amp; Janes from Spain,

00:06:48.588 --> 00:06:51.911
Sudamericana from Argentina
and Grijalbo from Mexico.

00:06:51.935 --> 00:06:54.005
I also publicly finished with
the newspapers

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:57.011
La Nación from Argentina
and El País from Spain.

00:06:57.035 --> 00:07:01.883
In 1400 words in the blog, free,
I told them to fuck off.

00:07:02.472 --> 00:07:03.614
(Laughs)

00:07:04.462 --> 00:07:05.720
(Applause)

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.685
As I did this,
and after a year of silence,

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:18.650
I started communicating
with the people from my blog

00:07:19.531 --> 00:07:21.724
and I told them I had a new idea.

00:07:22.327 --> 00:07:25.798
An idea that could be really fun
and especially risky

00:07:25.822 --> 00:07:28.856
but that had the secret goal of proving,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.435
also and specially to myself,

00:07:32.697 --> 00:07:36.958
that the famous crisis of the industry
is not an economic crisis

00:07:36.983 --> 00:07:40.198
but a moral one, it's a crisis of greed.

00:07:41.543 --> 00:07:43.820
The idea was of making
an impossible magazine

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:47.294
from my backyard, in a town in Catalonia,

00:07:47.318 --> 00:07:50.889
without any offices,
and with a staff integrated

00:07:50.913 --> 00:07:53.197
only by my family and childhood friends.

00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:57.198
A magazine that would be called Orsai,
just like my blog.

00:07:57.668 --> 00:08:00.250
One night with Chiri,
who's my dear friend,

00:08:00.274 --> 00:08:02.607
we wrote a kind of decalogue

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:07.726
a sort of promise to the readers.
This happened exactly one year ago.

00:08:08.313 --> 00:08:12.198
We promised the magazine wouldn't have
any advertising, not an inch of it.

00:08:12.518 --> 00:08:14.668
It wouldn't have
private or state subsidies.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.983
We promised it would have
the best graphic quality available

00:08:18.007 --> 00:08:20.700
in any of the countries where distributed.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.158
That it would do without
any possible intermediaries.

00:08:24.183 --> 00:08:28.198
That it would have a paper version,
and a dynamic version for iPad and iPhone,

00:08:28.222 --> 00:08:33.198
for BlackBerry and, besides,
a free PDF ten days later,

00:08:33.868 --> 00:08:37.198
so the magazine can be read
regardless of the cost.

00:08:38.477 --> 00:08:41.349
We promised those to write
and draw in the magazine

00:08:41.374 --> 00:08:44.398
would be only people me
and Chiri admire a lot.

00:08:44.422 --> 00:08:48.198
That it would be quarterly
and have more than 200 pages.

00:08:48.222 --> 00:08:53.198
That it would cost the equivalent of
15 Saturday newspapers in every country.

00:08:54.777 --> 00:08:57.999
We stated at the 8th item
that we were to put the money,

00:08:58.024 --> 00:09:00.761
and that we were going to make it
even if it didn't sell.

00:09:00.936 --> 00:09:05.198
The 9th item said that we would be happy
if we saved the investment.

00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:10.300
and the 10th, that if we didn't save
the investment, we didn't give a fuck...

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:16.101
(Applause)

00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:24.468
At that moment an amazing thing happened

00:09:24.492 --> 00:09:26.998
within the community of the blog.

00:09:27.022 --> 00:09:28.544
Something we hadn't foreseen:

00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:32.075
the readers of Orsai spread the idea,

00:09:32.252 --> 00:09:34.486
they told their friends

00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:38.224
there were some men in their forties,
in a town hidden in the mountain

00:09:38.248 --> 00:09:41.398
that wanted to make a
magazine of popular

00:09:41.422 --> 00:09:45.472
literature, of chronic
narrative, with long texts,

00:09:45.496 --> 00:09:48.650
just in the middle of the paper crisis.

00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:52.396
Before even telling them
what the magazine was going

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.944
to be about, the readers
started buying it massively.

00:09:56.515 --> 00:10:00.930
People put a faith that I hadn't seen
in a long time

00:10:00.954 --> 00:10:02.554
in a cultural product.

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:07.614
It was bought by 10 000 people,
I repeat: without knowing its contents,

00:10:07.638 --> 00:10:09.618
in pre-sale, before it was released.

00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:14.389
And it was an expensive magazine:
16 euros in Europe, 12 dollars in America.

00:10:15.437 --> 00:10:19.198
They bought it from everywhere, including
Salvadorans, Costa Ricans, Peruvians,

00:10:19.222 --> 00:10:23.198
Latin Americans living
in Thailand, in Japan.

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:27.198
Readers from every region decided
to distribute it themselves.

00:10:27.222 --> 00:10:31.198
We decided that magazines wouldn't be sold
per unit but in packs of ten,

00:10:31.222 --> 00:10:35.878
so that you could distribute
the remaining nine in your area.

00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:41.069
This way, we also killed
the intermediary for distribution,

00:10:41.093 --> 00:10:42.226
which is a mafia.

00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:46.003
Distribution gets
the 50% of the sale price

00:10:46.027 --> 00:10:48.611
of every publication we buy.

00:10:48.658 --> 00:10:53.989
The author gets the 8 %,
the big stores, the 50 %.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.228
The first day of this year,
the first number of Orsai was released.

00:10:59.252 --> 00:11:01.815
And we did so every three months,

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:04.927
until we reached the goal
of the four annual numbers.

00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:08.448
The fourth number went on sale
just one week ago.

00:11:08.472 --> 00:11:11.196
Every magazine weighs about a kilogram

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.946
and it makes a visual impact;
it has no advertising.

00:11:16.222 --> 00:11:20.613
More than a hundred invited authors
wrote through these four numbers.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.198
Among them Juan Villoro, Abelardo Castillo
Nick Hornby, Agustín Fernández Mallo.

00:11:25.222 --> 00:11:27.793
It was illustrated by 'el negro' Cris,
Horacio Altuna,

00:11:27.818 --> 00:11:30.953
Miguel Rep, Alberto
Montt, among many others.

00:11:31.403 --> 00:11:33.868
They were all paid in euros.

00:11:34.222 --> 00:11:38.988
In the middle of all that we discovered
that the dream was only possible

00:11:39.012 --> 00:11:40.928
if we talked with the readers,

00:11:40.952 --> 00:11:43.177
and so at mid-year,

00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:46.262
when we were between
numbers two and three,

00:11:46.401 --> 00:11:52.197
we decided, in an also rather risky way,
to turn into a publisher.

00:11:52.869 --> 00:11:56.224
The idea was to take a standard contract

00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:59.939
from my former publishing companies
and write the exact opposite.

00:12:02.334 --> 00:12:04.511
The idea was not to defraud the authors;

00:12:04.535 --> 00:12:06.668
the rights always for them.

00:12:07.062 --> 00:12:11.348
If you wanted to leave the next day,
"Good night, you can leave, all OK".

00:12:15.213 --> 00:12:21.483
And specially, the author is receiving
the 50 % of the sale's price,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.554
instead of the 8-10%,

00:12:24.603 --> 00:12:27.760
And even more, the author
has the possibility of, with a password,

00:12:27.785 --> 00:12:31.703
checking every sale and reader online.

00:12:31.728 --> 00:12:34.290
They also have the email
of that reader

00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:37.317
to thank them or tell them:

00:12:37.342 --> 00:12:40.615
"I know you're buying my books
and that you're paying to me."

00:12:41.937 --> 00:12:45.650
We noticed, as we moved forward,
that Orsai was not a blog anymore

00:12:45.675 --> 00:12:49.198
nor a magazine, or a
publishing house,

00:12:49.222 --> 00:12:52.309
but it turned into a project
of the readers.

00:12:53.222 --> 00:12:57.435
Two months ago we thought
of opening a bar in Buenos Aires,

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.870
a meeting place for those who read
the magazine, we named it Orsai.

00:13:03.192 --> 00:13:06.104
One afternoon I asked
the readers of the blog

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:09.492
if they wanted a bar to be opened
and I also asked them

00:13:09.517 --> 00:13:12.888
if anyone would like to join
the project as an investor.

00:13:13.343 --> 00:13:17.814
We received 204 emails in 24 hours,

00:13:18.702 --> 00:13:22.758
with people that wanted to put
1000 or 10 000, a nuts offered 80 000.

00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:26.384
There were also people who had no money,

00:13:26.408 --> 00:13:28.893
and they offered to paint the bar,

00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:31.746
or to help us with the permits

00:13:31.786 --> 00:13:34.644
as they worked in some ministry, etc.

00:13:34.668 --> 00:13:37.292
Others offered to show
their paintings

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:40.190
or to play with their bands
once the bar was opened.

00:13:40.214 --> 00:13:43.341
This occurred in early August this year.

00:13:44.002 --> 00:13:47.748
The Orsai bar opened last Thursday
in the heart of San Telmo,

00:13:47.772 --> 00:13:53.761
471 Humberto Primo, 2x1 beer before 10 pm.

00:13:55.137 --> 00:13:59.787
There were so many people in the opening
we had to do it four times:

00:13:59.812 --> 00:14:03.500
Thursday, Friday, Saturday
and last Sunday.

00:14:03.942 --> 00:14:06.604
In March we will try opening
another bar in Barcelona,

00:14:06.628 --> 00:14:10.010
using the same system of investment
of the readers,

00:14:10.034 --> 00:14:13.418
and the goal for the next year
is to keep making magazines,

00:14:13.442 --> 00:14:16.958
this time bimonthly, and besides
making a lot more books,

00:14:16.997 --> 00:14:19.776
the goal will be to open a third bar
in Central America

00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:22.544
to form a sort of Iberoamerican
triangle of culture,

00:14:22.568 --> 00:14:24.568
or of the drunks who read, or something...

00:14:26.503 --> 00:14:30.827
Two weeks ago we almost had
two and a half tons

00:14:30.852 --> 00:14:34.537
of our books and magazines stopped
in Buenos Aires' customs,

00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:37.418
due to a misunderstanding
with the Secretariat of Commerce.

00:14:37.706 --> 00:14:42.198
It was a wonderful Thursday,
Orsai readers from all over the world

00:14:42.222 --> 00:14:46.686
made a lot of noise in Twitter
with the slogan "Free Orsai".

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:52.198
And that was big, because 12 hours later
the Argentinian government heard us,

00:14:52.222 --> 00:14:55.799
and the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers
answered through Twitter

00:14:55.824 --> 00:14:58.791
saying he would personally
solve the matter.

00:14:58.816 --> 00:15:01.268
The magazines were
released by the next day.

00:15:01.292 --> 00:15:05.198
It's the last story I will tell.
I believe that it means something.

00:15:05.222 --> 00:15:07.997
I'm sure it's the beginning of something.

00:15:08.854 --> 00:15:13.198
Cultural decisions are starting
to be more and more in our hands.

00:15:13.743 --> 00:15:18.198
We no longer obey to voices in sole
speakers that tell us what to do.

00:15:18.222 --> 00:15:21.198
It's us who communicate,

00:15:21.768 --> 00:15:26.466
we are 400 million people
who speak Spanish.

00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:29.566
Every one of us, every region,

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.917
has a different jargon
that makes us unique,

00:15:31.942 --> 00:15:34.198
but that also enriches us.

00:15:34.883 --> 00:15:40.175
We understand each other, the Internet
arrived some time ago to unite us,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.986
to tell us we can do things together,
specially with culture,

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.198
which is the fundamental base
of the complexity of the mind.

00:15:48.222 --> 00:15:54.459
Almost ten years ago I opened a blog
because I felt alone in a foreign country.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.859
I felt in offside, I needed to communicate
with my people,

00:15:59.176 --> 00:16:01.065
and so named it Orsai.

00:16:01.222 --> 00:16:04.517
I am sure now that the cultural industry

00:16:04.541 --> 00:16:06.741
are we, the readers and the authors.

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:08.197
And nobody else...

00:16:08.222 --> 00:16:11.627
and that the other industry,
which is afraid of changes,

00:16:11.652 --> 00:16:15.198
that tries to make us believe
that the Internet is a burden.

00:16:15.982 --> 00:16:21.537
the one that scratches and hurts,
is dying and we'll watch it die.

00:16:22.037 --> 00:16:25.198
Culture has to be free in every way.

00:16:25.998 --> 00:16:32.198
I exhort authors and editors to,
every time you release a book,

00:16:32.222 --> 00:16:36.122
upload a free PDF the same day,

00:16:36.146 --> 00:16:37.746
because you will sell more.

00:16:37.927 --> 00:16:42.198
We depended on a greedy industry
for years,

00:16:42.855 --> 00:16:45.667
buying what they wanted us to buy.

00:16:45.691 --> 00:16:48.816
Now suddenly, and more and more,

00:16:49.578 --> 00:16:51.681
they're starting to be "orsai".

00:16:52.205 --> 00:16:53.801
Thank you.
