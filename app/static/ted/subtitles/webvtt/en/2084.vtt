WEBVTT

00:00:02.058 --> 00:00:04.882
Hello. Well, let me start
by asking you a question:

00:00:05.537 --> 00:00:08.905
How many of you had to fill out
some sort of web form

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.318
where you've been asked to read
a distorted sequence of characters?

00:00:16.163 --> 00:00:18.097
How many of you found it really annoying?

00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:20.761
Okay, outstanding. So I invented that.

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.373
(Laughter)

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:25.848
(Applause)

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:31.789
That thing is called a CAPTCHA.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.837
And it is there to make sure
the entity filling out the form

00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:38.713
is actually a human and not
some sort of computer program

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:43.084
that was written to submit the form
millions and millions of times.

00:00:43.108 --> 00:00:45.014
The reason it works is because humans

00:00:45.038 --> 00:00:47.443
have no trouble reading
these squiggly characters,

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:50.308
whereas computer programs
simply can't do it as well yet.

00:00:50.332 --> 00:00:54.276
For example, when you're buying tickets
online for attending a concert

00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:57.494
the reason you have to type

00:00:57.518 --> 00:01:02.183
these distorted characters is to prevent

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:04.155
scalpers from writing a program

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:07.004
that can buy millions of tickets,
two at a time.

00:01:07.028 --> 00:01:08.956
CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.511
And since they're used so often,

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:15.822
a lot of times the precise sequence
of random characters shown to the user

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:17.422
is not so fortunate.

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:20.923
So this is an example from Yahoo.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:23.314
The random characters that happened

00:01:23.338 --> 00:01:27.306
to be shown to the user were W, A, I, T

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.621
which spells a word.

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:32.564
But the best part is the message
that the Yahoo help desk

00:01:32.588 --> 00:01:35.634
got about 20 minutes later.

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:38.358
["Help! I've been waiting
for over 20 minutes,

00:01:38.382 --> 00:01:41.800
and nothing happens."]
(Laughter)

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.734
This of course, is not as bad
as this poor person.

00:01:45.758 --> 00:01:49.017
[REBOOT]
(Laughter)

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.549
I can tell funny stories
about captchas for hours

00:01:51.573 --> 00:01:53.409
but since I cannot do that

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:56.218
let me tell you about a project
that we did afterwards

00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:58.463
which is sort of the next
evolution of CAPTCHA.

00:01:58.488 --> 00:01:59.845
We call it reCAPTCHA,

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.251
which is something that
we started at the University,

00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:05.431
and then we turned it
into a startup company.

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:07.374
And then Google acquired this company.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.917
so, all what I'm going to say
for the next 5 minutes

00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:11.505
is owned by Google.

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.751
So, please, do not spread the word.

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:18.633
So let me tell you
how this project started.

00:02:18.657 --> 00:02:23.127
It turns out that about 200 million
CAPTCHAs are typed everyday.

00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:26.239
When I first heard this,
I was quite proud of myself.

00:02:26.263 --> 00:02:29.266
I thought, "look at the impact
that my research has had."

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.205
But then I started feeling bad.

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:33.108
They are not only obnoxious, but also

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:36.577
each time you type a CAPTCHA

00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:38.933
essentially you waste
10 seconds of your time.

00:02:38.957 --> 00:02:42.684
And if you multiply that
by 200 million you get that

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:46.722
humanity as a whole is wasting
about 500,000 hours every day

00:02:46.746 --> 00:02:48.949
typing these annoying CAPTCHAs.

00:02:48.973 --> 00:02:51.417
So then I started feeling bad.

00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:54.469
And then I started thinking,
is there any way

00:02:54.493 --> 00:02:58.341
we can use this effort for something
that is good for humanity?

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:03.695
While you're typing a CAPTCHA,
during those 10 seconds,

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.844
your brain is doing something amazing.

00:03:05.868 --> 00:03:09.576
Your brain is doing something
that computers cannot yet do.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.432
So can we get you to do some

00:03:11.456 --> 00:03:13.166
useful work to mankind?

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.371
Putting it differently,

00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:16.977
is there some humongous problem
that we cannot yet get

00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:18.523
computers to solve,

00:03:18.547 --> 00:03:20.675
yet we can split into tiny chunks

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.856
such that each time
somebody solves a CAPTCHA

00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:24.934
they solve a little bit of this problem?

00:03:24.957 --> 00:03:27.868
The answer to that is "yes,"
and this is what we're doing now.

00:03:27.893 --> 00:03:32.591
So what you may not know is that
nowadays while you're typing a CAPTCHA,

00:03:32.615 --> 00:03:35.772
not only are you authenticating
yourself as a human,

00:03:35.796 --> 00:03:38.676
but in addition you're actually
helping us to digitize books.

00:03:38.827 --> 00:03:40.616
So let me explain how this works.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.297
So there's a lot of projects out there
trying to digitize the existing books.

00:03:44.322 --> 00:03:45.749
Google is digitizing books.

00:03:45.773 --> 00:03:48.418
Amazon, with the Kindle,
is digitizing books.

00:03:48.443 --> 00:03:51.116
The way this works
is you start with an old book.

00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:53.142
You've seen those things, right?

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.204
Like a book?

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.557
(Laughter)

00:03:55.582 --> 00:03:58.063
So you start with a book,
and then you scan it.

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:03.549
Now scanning a book is like taking
a digital photograph of every page.

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:09.883
The next step in the process
is that the computer

00:04:09.908 --> 00:04:15.128
needs to be able to decipher
all of the words in this image.

00:04:15.152 --> 00:04:18.815
Now the problem is that for older books
that were written several years ago

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.291
the computer cannot recognize
a lot of the words

00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:25.119
because the ink has faded
and the pages have turned yellow.

00:04:25.143 --> 00:04:26.953
Thus the words look a bit different

00:04:26.977 --> 00:04:29.803
and the computer cannot recognize them.

00:04:29.827 --> 00:04:32.468
So, for books that were written
more than 50 years ago,

00:04:32.493 --> 00:04:35.895
the computer cannot recognize
about 30 percent of the words.

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.084
So what we're doing now

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:40.400
is we're taking all of the words
that the computer cannot recognize

00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:43.824
and we're getting people to read them
for us while they're typing

00:04:43.848 --> 00:04:45.311
a CAPTCHA on the Internet.

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:47.727
So, the next time you type a CAPTCHA -

00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:54.322
(Applause)

00:04:54.346 --> 00:04:57.535
these words that you're typing

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:00.927
are actually words that are coming
from books that are being digitized

00:05:00.951 --> 00:05:03.145
that the computer could not recognize.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.958
And now the reason we have
two words nowadays instead of one

00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:12.167
is because we need to verify
if the answer is correct.

00:05:13.588 --> 00:05:17.682
Because one of the words is such
that the system knows what it was,

00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:20.728
and the other is a word that
the system just got out of a book,

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:23.538
it didn't know what it was,
and it's presented to you.

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:27.069
We're going to ask you to type both words.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:29.072
And we won't tell you which one's which.

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:30.682
And if you type the correct word

00:05:30.707 --> 00:05:33.483
for the one for which the system
already knows the answer,

00:05:33.508 --> 00:05:35.069
it assumes you are human,

00:05:35.093 --> 00:05:39.600
and it also gets some confidence
that you typed the other word correctly.

00:05:39.624 --> 00:05:43.264
And if we repeat this process
to like 10 different people

00:05:43.288 --> 00:05:45.582
and all of them agree
on what the new word is,

00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:47.884
we are very confident
that this new word

00:05:47.908 --> 00:05:49.850
was accurately digitized.

00:05:49.874 --> 00:05:51.920
So this is how the system works.

00:05:51.944 --> 00:05:54.396
The good thing is that
it has been very successful.

00:05:54.428 --> 00:05:57.825
We're digitizing about
100 million words a day,

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.513
which is the equivalent of
about two million books a year.

00:06:01.537 --> 00:06:04.436
And this is all being done
one word at a time

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.016
by just people typing CAPTCHAs
on the Internet.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.672
Now, since we're doing
so many words per day,

00:06:10.696 --> 00:06:14.724
funny things can happen.

00:06:14.748 --> 00:06:18.286
And this is especially true
because now we're giving people

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.676
two randomly chosen English words
next to each other.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.976
So funny things can happen.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.976
For example, we presented this word.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.284
It's the word "Christians";
there's nothing wrong with it.

00:06:30.308 --> 00:06:33.976
But if you present it along with
another randomly chosen word,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.276
bad things can happen.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.128
So we get this.
[bad Christians]

00:06:38.152 --> 00:06:39.317
(Laughter)

00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:40.860
It's quite funny.

00:06:40.884 --> 00:06:43.316
But it's even worse,
because the particular website

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.251
where we showed this

00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:50.080
actually happened to be called
The Embassy of the Kingdom of God.

00:06:50.104 --> 00:06:51.841
(Laughter)

00:06:51.865 --> 00:06:52.959
Oops!

00:06:52.984 --> 00:06:54.882
Here's another really bad one.

00:06:54.906 --> 00:06:59.417
American politician, JohnEdwards.com
[Damn liberal]

00:06:59.441 --> 00:07:03.691
(Laughter)

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.836
So we keep on insulting people everyday.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.971
Now, we're not just insulting people.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:11.851
Quite often,
interesting things can happen.

00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:15.009
So this actually has given rise
to an Internet meme

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:17.367
that millions of people
have participated in,

00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:20.173
which is called CAPTCHA art.

00:07:20.197 --> 00:07:21.759
Here's how it works.

00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:25.505
Imagine you're using the
Internet and you see a CAPTCHA

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:27.917
that you think is somewhat peculiar,

00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:30.204
like this CAPTCHA.

00:07:30.228 --> 00:07:33.484
Then what you're supposed to do
is you take a screen shot of it.

00:07:33.508 --> 00:07:35.395
Then of course,
you fill out the CAPTCHA

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.119
because you help us
digitize a book, please.

00:07:38.143 --> 00:07:40.160
But then, first you take a screen shot,

00:07:40.184 --> 00:07:44.389
and then you draw something
that is related to it, like this.

00:07:44.413 --> 00:07:46.082
[invisible toaster]

00:07:46.106 --> 00:07:47.136
(Laughter)

00:07:47.161 --> 00:07:50.639
It's just an example of CAPTCHA art.

00:07:50.662 --> 00:07:54.359
There are tens of thousands of these.
Some of them are interesting.

00:07:54.383 --> 00:07:57.672
Some of them are very cute.
[clenched it!]

00:07:57.696 --> 00:08:01.190
Some of them are funnier.

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:07.551
[stoned founders]
(Laughter)

00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:11.761
This is my favorite number
of this whole project: 900 millions.

00:08:11.785 --> 00:08:14.921
This is the number of distinct people

00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:17.307
that have helped us digitize
at least one word

00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.067
out of a book through reCAPTCHA.

00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:21.186
A little over 10%
of the world's population,

00:08:21.211 --> 00:08:22.946
has helped digitize human knowledge.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.992
And it is numbers like these
that motivate my research agenda.

00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:29.553
So the question that motivates
my research is the following:

00:08:29.577 --> 00:08:32.626
If you look at humanity's
large-scale achievements,

00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:35.371
these really big things that humanity
has gotten together

00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:40.099
like building the pyramids of Egypt
or the Panama Canal

00:08:40.123 --> 00:08:42.357
or putting a man on the Moon --

00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:44.813
there is a curious fact about them,

00:08:44.837 --> 00:08:48.268
and it is that they were all done
with about the same number of people.

00:08:48.292 --> 00:08:50.836
They were all done with
about 100,000 people.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.231
We can ask ourselves
why is that all of them used

00:08:53.256 --> 00:08:54.842
about the same number of people.

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:57.368
The reason for that is because,
before the Internet,

00:08:57.393 --> 00:09:00.797
coordinating more than
100,000 people was impossible.

00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:03.535
But now with the Internet,
I've just shown you a project

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:06.433
where we've coordinated
900 million people.

00:09:06.457 --> 00:09:08.734
So the question that
motivates my research is,

00:09:08.758 --> 00:09:11.238
if we can put a man on the Moon
with 100,000 people,

00:09:11.262 --> 00:09:14.219
what can we do with
100 million people?

00:09:14.243 --> 00:09:17.371
Based on this question,
we've been working on a lot of projects.

00:09:17.395 --> 00:09:19.397
I will not tell you
about all we have done.

00:09:19.421 --> 00:09:22.446
But, let me tell you about
one that we are working on now.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.479
We've been working on this
for about two years now.

00:09:25.503 --> 00:09:29.737
And we're going to launch it
in about 30 days.

00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:32.511
It's called Duolingo.

00:09:32.535 --> 00:09:35.484
This project started asking
the following question:

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:39.798
How can we get 100 million people

00:09:39.822 --> 00:09:45.173
translating the Web into
every major language for free?

00:09:45.197 --> 00:09:47.736
So there's a lot of things
to say about this question.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.441
First of all, translating the Web.

00:09:49.466 --> 00:09:51.960
Right now it is partitioned
into multiple languages.

00:09:51.984 --> 00:09:54.065
A large fraction of it is in English.

00:09:54.089 --> 00:09:56.524
If you don't know any English,
you can't access it.

00:09:56.548 --> 00:09:58.618
But large fractions are
in other languages,

00:09:58.643 --> 00:10:01.443
and if you don't know the languages
you can't access them.

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:05.026
I would like to translate all
of the Web into every major language.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.209
Now some of you may say,

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.686
why can't we use computers to translate?

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.677
Machine translation nowadays is starting
to translate some sentences.

00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:17.079
Well the problem with that is that

00:10:17.103 --> 00:10:18.797
it's not yet good enough,

00:10:18.821 --> 00:10:23.275
and it probably won't be
for the next 20 to 30 years.

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:26.531
So let me show you an example of something

00:10:26.555 --> 00:10:28.240
that was translated by a machine.

00:10:28.264 --> 00:10:32.834
Actually it was a forum
about programming questions.

00:10:37.614 --> 00:10:40.208
It was a programming question
translated from Japanese

00:10:40.233 --> 00:10:44.667
into English and from then into Spanish,
though my translation is good.

00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:46.941
The other one is bad. You'll see.

00:10:46.965 --> 00:10:50.447
So I'll just let you read.

00:10:50.471 --> 00:10:53.308
This person starts apologizing for
the machine translation.

00:10:53.332 --> 00:10:55.954
Indeed, this was done with
the best translation program

00:10:55.978 --> 00:10:57.421
from Japanese into English.

00:10:57.445 --> 00:11:03.475
Remember, it's a question
about computer programming.

00:11:03.499 --> 00:11:06.076
So here you are the preamble
to the question.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:11.893
[At often, the goat-time install
a error is vomit.] (Laughter)

00:11:11.917 --> 00:11:13.995
Then comes the first part of the question.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:19.726
[How many times like the wind, a pole,
and the dragon?] (Laughter)

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.801
Then comes my favorite part
of the question.

00:11:21.825 --> 00:11:25.939
[This insult to father's stones?]
(Laughter)

00:11:25.963 --> 00:11:28.444
And then comes my favorite
part of the whole thing.

00:11:28.468 --> 00:11:32.451
[Please apologize for your stupidity.
There are a many thank you.] (Laughter)

00:11:32.475 --> 00:11:34.950
Okay, so computer translation
isn't yet good enough.

00:11:34.974 --> 00:11:36.594
We need people to translate.

00:11:36.618 --> 00:11:39.332
So what I want is to get
100 million people

00:11:39.356 --> 00:11:42.640
translating the Web into
every major language for free.

00:11:42.665 --> 00:11:45.600
I couldn't afford paying
100 million people for the job,

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.202
so I want them to do it for free.

00:11:47.227 --> 00:11:48.940
Now if this is what you want to do,

00:11:48.965 --> 00:11:51.485
you pretty quickly realize
you're going to run into

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:55.949
two pretty big obstacles,
needing to be hurdled.

00:11:55.973 --> 00:12:00.028
The first one is a lack of bilinguals.

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:03.159
So I don't even know if there
exists 100 million people out there

00:12:03.183 --> 00:12:06.501
using the Web who are bilingual
enough to help us translate.

00:12:06.525 --> 00:12:07.570
That's a big problem.

00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:09.708
The other problem is a lack of motivation.

00:12:09.732 --> 00:12:13.720
How are we going to motivate people
to actually translate the Web for free?

00:12:13.744 --> 00:12:18.844
After thinking about this for months,

00:12:18.868 --> 00:12:20.864
we realized there's actually a way

00:12:20.888 --> 00:12:23.610
to solve both these problems
with the same solution.

00:12:23.634 --> 00:12:26.720
We realized that there's a way
to kill two birds with one stone.

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:30.892
And that is to transform
language translation

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:33.986
into something that millions
of people want to do,

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.882
and that also helps with
the problem of lack of bilinguals,

00:12:37.906 --> 00:12:40.416
and that is language education.

00:12:40.441 --> 00:12:44.061
It turns out there are millions of people
wanting to learn other languages.

00:12:44.085 --> 00:12:49.119
Today there are over 1.2 billion people
learning a foreign language.

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:52.326
And it's not just because
they're being forced to do so in school.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.936
For example, in the United States alone,
there are over

00:12:54.961 --> 00:12:58.936
5 million people who have paid
over $500 for software

00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:00.459
to learn a new language.

00:13:00.483 --> 00:13:03.364
Many people want to learn a new language.

00:13:03.388 --> 00:13:06.667
So what we've been working on
for the last two years

00:13:06.691 --> 00:13:08.824
is a new website called Duolingo,

00:13:08.848 --> 00:13:11.816
where the basic idea is
people learn a new language

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:17.188
for free, while simultaneously
translating the Web.

00:13:17.916 --> 00:13:19.977
And so they're learning by doing.

00:13:20.001 --> 00:13:21.634
So this is how it works.

00:13:21.658 --> 00:13:25.528
The way this works is whenever
you're a just a beginner,

00:13:25.552 --> 00:13:28.036
we give you very,
very simple sentences on the Web.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.716
And if you don't know a word
we'll tell you what each word means

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.159
though you are asked
to "translate this sentence".

00:13:34.184 --> 00:13:36.058
And it turns out that it really works.

00:13:36.082 --> 00:13:38.358
Even though people know nothing
of the language

00:13:38.383 --> 00:13:41.635
if we explain what each word means,
they'll be able to translate it.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.432
As you see how other people translate

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:45.842
the same sentence,
you start learning the language.

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:47.857
And as you get more and more advanced,

00:13:47.881 --> 00:13:51.078
we give you more and more
complex sentences to translate.

00:13:51.102 --> 00:13:53.431
This is how
you are going to help us translate.

00:13:53.455 --> 00:13:55.104
This is how the site works.

00:13:55.128 --> 00:13:57.118
We're mostly done building it,

00:13:57.142 --> 00:13:59.415
and now we're testing it.

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:01.184
When we started working on this

00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:03.653
I didn't think it could work, really.

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:06.183
But it turns out that
it works, indeed. It's amazing.

00:14:06.207 --> 00:14:08.988
First, people really
can learn a language with it.

00:14:09.012 --> 00:14:12.369
In this case we are testing it with people

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:14.751
knowing English,
wanting to learn Spanish,

00:14:14.775 --> 00:14:16.049
and vice versa.

00:14:16.073 --> 00:14:18.309
So people really do learn a language.

00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:19.920
And they learn it about as well

00:14:19.945 --> 00:14:22.077
as the leading language learning software,

00:14:22.102 --> 00:14:24.498
which is very good,
but perhaps more surprisingly,

00:14:24.523 --> 00:14:28.924
the translations that we get from people
using the site are very good.

00:14:28.948 --> 00:14:30.767
They are as accurate as those

00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:33.291
of professional language translators.

00:14:33.315 --> 00:14:36.407
Now of course,
we play a trick here and it is that

00:14:36.431 --> 00:14:40.748
we combine the translations
of multiple beginners, several students,

00:14:40.772 --> 00:14:42.490
and choose the best.

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:44.742
But it turns out
that that best translation

00:14:44.767 --> 00:14:47.925
is as good as those of
professional language translators.

00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:53.553
Now even though we're combining
multiple translations,

00:14:54.857 --> 00:14:57.073
another good thing about Duolingo is that

00:14:57.097 --> 00:15:00.188
the site actually
can translate pretty fast.

00:15:00.212 --> 00:15:03.531
So let me show you an estimate
of how fast we could translate.

00:15:03.555 --> 00:15:06.579
If we wanted to translate Wikipedia
from English into Spanish --

00:15:06.604 --> 00:15:09.319
of course, Wikipedia exists in Spanish
but is much smaller

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:12.098
than its English counterpart,
about 20 percent of it --

00:15:12.122 --> 00:15:15.711
If we wanted to translate Wikipedia
from English into Spanish using Duolingo

00:15:15.735 --> 00:15:20.922
we could do it in five weeks
with 100,000 active users

00:15:20.946 --> 00:15:22.500
learning English with Duolingo.

00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:25.623
And we could do it in about 80 hours
with a million active users.

00:15:25.647 --> 00:15:28.333
Since all the projects that
my group has worked on so far

00:15:28.357 --> 00:15:29.994
have gotten millions of users,

00:15:30.018 --> 00:15:33.452
we're hopeful that we'll be able
to translate the Web for free.

00:15:33.476 --> 00:15:35.693
We haven't yet launched Duolingo,

00:15:35.717 --> 00:15:39.113
(Applause)

00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:46.895
I'd like to leave you with --

00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:49.941
we haven't yet launched Duolingo
we plan to do so in 30 days.

00:15:49.966 --> 00:15:52.230
If you visit Duolingo.com, you can sign up

00:15:52.254 --> 00:15:56.547
to be part of our private beta
in about 30 days.

00:15:56.572 --> 00:15:57.658
Help us.

00:15:57.683 --> 00:15:58.833
Thank you.

00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:00.373
(Applause)
