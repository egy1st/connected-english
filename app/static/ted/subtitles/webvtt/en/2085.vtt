00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.323
This here is the Trimaker I, a 3D printer.

00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:13.350
3D printers are machines
that allow us to make things,

00:00:14.227 --> 00:00:16.637
to build our own objects.

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:19.820
I think 3D printers will change
the world in the next few years,

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:22.968
they will change our lives.

00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:28.816
As a child I always liked
working with my hands.

00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:31.937
I liked to build my own toys.

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:35.603
I remember how
the feeling of building my own toy

00:00:35.627 --> 00:00:39.569
was totally different
from having one that was bought.

00:00:39.593 --> 00:00:42.877
I used dad's tools for this,

00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:45.675
which were my inspiration.

00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:50.784
At the age of 6, I remember
electrocuting myself for the first time.

00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:53.149
I was fixing a small Christmas tree.

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:58.339
It happened again when I was 14,
and it was more powerful.

00:00:58.363 --> 00:01:03.978
I remember I was fixing granddad's drill.

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:05.809
I didn't notice I was barefoot.

00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:09.644
I plugged it in, and immediately
my body started shaking.

00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:12.850
I felt how the electricity
went through my hands,

00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:15.477
my body, then my feet,

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.317
and I was thrown to the ground.

00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:19.666
Somebody helped me.

00:01:20.348 --> 00:01:27.234
After such a practical lesson,
my Italian granddad came and said:

00:01:27.258 --> 00:01:28.594
"Ma, bambino, siediti qui."

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.602
"I am going to give you
the theoretical lesson."

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:34.801
I can promise you I never forgot

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:38.033
what the power wire
and a ground discharge were.

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.504
Time passed

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.321
and I kept building my own toys,

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:48.074
but each time a bit more complex.

00:01:48.098 --> 00:01:50.563
A friend of mine, Dan Etenberg,
built this turbine.

00:01:50.587 --> 00:01:53.542
We loved getting together
to do this kind of crazy stuff.

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:56.589
He calls and says: "Hey, Maxi,
listen: I finished the turbine,

00:01:56.613 --> 00:01:58.939
I finished solving that thing
we had to mill...

00:01:58.963 --> 00:02:00.496
I'm going to your granddad's!

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.747
Can you imagine granddad's face

00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:06.225
when we told him we were putting
a turbine in the garden?

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.043
Granddad shut himself in the kitchen.

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:13.200
We were bringing a device this big,
that could turn at 130,000 rpm.,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.276
that needed protection
in case the blades went flying out

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.750
and it also threw a 16-inch flame.
And the noise it made...

00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:24.974
I can't push it out of my mind...

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:29.277
It was as if a Sky Harrier
was landing in granddad's garden.

00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:32.677
I think he might have thought that,
that a helicopter was landing.

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:36.951
I asked Dan afterwards:
"Hey, Dan, what can we build now?

00:02:36.975 --> 00:02:39.702
How about building a laser?"

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:42.532
We were good boys,
but we enjoyed these things.

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:46.919
Of course, a laser beam.
We had to be very careful.

00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:51.436
If we touched that aluminum part
in the discharge tube...

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.433
There were 30,000 volts going through it!

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:01.220
But we liked these things
and we wanted to do what we enjoyed.

00:03:02.152 --> 00:03:05.625
That lab was like Frankenstein's.

00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:08.435
After some time I said,
among other things:

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.568
"Well, I don't want to keep asking
for dad's tools,

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:16.568
and this time I will build
my own stuff, with a milling machine."

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:20.355
A milling machine is a Cartesian robot
that withdraws material

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.643
from a plastic or wooden block
until it builds what you can see there

00:03:24.812 --> 00:03:27.196
which can be any kind of object.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.228
It was around 10 months of building
to obtain the object in 1 hour.

00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.416
We were just watching the machine work.

00:03:35.478 --> 00:03:37.820
There was an incredible intensity.

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:42.949
But there was a question
I could not answer myself:

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.646
Can one live off what's fun to do?

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.779
Or are entertainment and work
like water and oil?

00:03:52.946 --> 00:03:54.452
Do they mix?

00:03:56.198 --> 00:03:58.645
Can you mix fun with business opportunity?

00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:05.603
This is how I started getting into
the subject of 3D printers.

00:04:05.643 --> 00:04:09.166
Because it was a technology
that kept me awake at night

00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:14.131
and that, additionally, I saw
as a possible business opportunity.

00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:19.637
But, I recall I started out saying

00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:22.086
I was here to tell you
about my first time, right?

00:04:22.216 --> 00:04:25.467
The first time I printed
with a 3D printer I made by myself.

00:04:25.491 --> 00:04:27.731
Let me introduce you: This is Marsi 1.

00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:29.694
Yes, it looks like
an ice-cream machine.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.947
But believe me, it was a 3D printer.

00:04:31.973 --> 00:04:34.063
My first time was disastrous.

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:39.919
I tried for 3 months
and nothing happened, nothing at all.

00:04:40.703 --> 00:04:42.847
I remember I had already
spoken with investors,

00:04:42.872 --> 00:04:45.362
I was giving talks
at the University of Buenos Aires,

00:04:45.388 --> 00:04:48.609
telling everyone that I was building
a 3D printer that did not print

00:04:48.634 --> 00:04:50.593
and that the only thing it did was this.

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.116
I wanted to do a bracelet,
all I got was that smashed thing.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.234
I wanted to do Star-Wars' Yoda,

00:04:57.258 --> 00:04:59.266
I got that fried egg you can see there.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.080
Every time that happened to me,
it felt like being stabbed in the chest.

00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:06.620
I went to bed very sad.

00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:10.728
Until one day, I decided
not to pay any attention to it any more.

00:05:11.538 --> 00:05:14.101
This story is 100% true.

00:05:14.288 --> 00:05:17.111
I would always stand there,
watching for two hours,

00:05:17.137 --> 00:05:19.584
and this would come out.

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.386
This time I went
to the supermarket and left her.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.574
As if on purpose,
when I came back I found this.

00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:28.153
You don't know how I felt!

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:29.754
I was literally jumping for joy.

00:05:29.778 --> 00:05:33.949
Imagine arriving and seeing
"Venus de Milo" hanging there.

00:05:33.976 --> 00:05:35.475
It was 2 x 2 x 3 cm,

00:05:35.528 --> 00:05:40.073
but to me, it was like touching heaven
with my hands.

00:05:40.786 --> 00:05:43.379
It improved, little by little.

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:47.028
And we started printing other things.

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.986
I am going to talk a bit
about the technology.

00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:51.810
Can you see that white pan?

00:05:51.955 --> 00:05:54.502
A photosensitive resin is placed there.

00:05:54.526 --> 00:05:57.761
And it is illuminated from beneath,
layer by layer,

00:05:57.868 --> 00:05:59.699
the level surfaces are projected

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:04.420
until the morphology
one has programmed and designed is built.

00:06:04.473 --> 00:06:10.041
There you can see my favorite figure,
which is "The Clay Bottle."

00:06:10.065 --> 00:06:12.841
And over there, that green figure, is me.

00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:16.317
Don't tell, but I want to give it
to my girlfriend as a birthday present.

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:17.356
Good idea?

00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:22.601
What we are building with now

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:26.515
are different types of rubber
and wax components,

00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:30.631
we are printing in plastic,
different colours.

00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:35.520
Here you can see
the "Venus de Milo" keyring.

00:06:35.544 --> 00:06:39.596
That was the first.
It brings good luck, I hope.

00:06:42.731 --> 00:06:46.418
So you can see that not only
about the useless things I just showed you

00:06:46.442 --> 00:06:52.197
but this technology, nowadays,
is changing people's lives.

00:06:52.582 --> 00:06:57.208
That small girl had
parts of her body scanned.

00:06:57.304 --> 00:07:01.326
An exoskeleton was printed

00:07:01.352 --> 00:07:08.725
and it was able to alleviate
the mobility problem she had.

00:07:08.827 --> 00:07:11.268
Below that, you can see a jaw.

00:07:11.292 --> 00:07:14.916
That mandible was built
using selective laser melting technology

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.639
with aluminum powder.

00:07:16.663 --> 00:07:20.504
It was created for an 83 year-old woman,
who can now move her jaw.

00:07:25.754 --> 00:07:27.305
This is Marina.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.669
She is my cousin.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:38.597
In 2006, she had a very serious accident,

00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:40.849
a car accident.

00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:45.686
The doctors weren't very optimistic.

00:07:46.703 --> 00:07:50.705
The truth is it shocked
the whole family very badly.

00:07:51.425 --> 00:07:55.645
She had multiple injuries of all kinds.

00:07:57.683 --> 00:08:00.206
One of the worst was a head injury.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.723
She had lost part
of the bone structure in her head.

00:08:04.222 --> 00:08:06.107
There were 2 options.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.708
One was to stick
to traditional treatments.

00:08:10.732 --> 00:08:15.791
It meant taking a kind of
bio-compatible coating texture

00:08:15.815 --> 00:08:18.836
and putting it in place
in an almost manual fashion,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.754
until the part of the skull
that was missing was covered.

00:08:23.062 --> 00:08:25.144
The second option

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:32.769
was taking a CT scan

00:08:32.898 --> 00:08:39.611
and digitally building the cranium
directly from that scan.

00:08:40.918 --> 00:08:44.437
And afterwards, the part that was missing

00:08:44.461 --> 00:08:49.601
would be rebuilt in software
to be finally printed in 3D.

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:53.490
They went with the second option.

00:08:53.649 --> 00:08:56.159
Today, Marina enjoys a splendid life,

00:08:56.188 --> 00:08:59.619
she has 2 children,
enjoys time with her family

00:08:59.645 --> 00:09:02.342
and has just run a marathon.

00:09:05.443 --> 00:09:08.960
I hope that what started out
as simply having fun,

00:09:11.096 --> 00:09:16.707
can help people in the future.

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:23.891
This makes me think
it is possible to do what makes you happy,

00:09:25.301 --> 00:09:27.939
and that it's possible
to change the world,

00:09:27.965 --> 00:09:29.850
while feeling like it's the first time.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:30.899
Thank you.
