00:00:01.623 --> 00:00:04.615
Let’s face it, that button has something
that draws us to it.

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:06.376
We can’t resist pressing it.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.129
Just as curiosity sparks our interest
in our surroundings,

00:00:09.153 --> 00:00:12.065
it’s the question of what might happen
if we press that button

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.391
that makes it irresistible.

00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:16.104
Today almost everything,
even this talk, begins or ends

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.571
by pressing a button.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:19.734
Now buttons are nothing new,

00:00:19.758 --> 00:00:21.813
when TV became mainstream,
we had buttons,

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:25.029
but they just changed the channels,
nothing surprising.

00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:28.657
After the age of passive TV viewing
videogames arrived.

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.595
Nothing crazy, but now buttons
did something else.

00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:35.524
They had more than a single purpose
and became programmable,

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.825
so now you had to press them
to know what they did.

00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:43.236
That sparked our curiosity:
the mystery of the button.

00:00:44.174 --> 00:00:46.214
Then the 80s came along.

00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:50.947
I grew up when videogames became popular,
especially game consoles.

00:00:51.647 --> 00:00:55.228
This was the start of interactive
entertainment mediated by technology.

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:59.238
Although I lost often, as you can see,
I got hooked.

00:00:59.263 --> 00:01:02.016
With that upbringing,
I wanted everything to have buttons.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.614
Even if nowadays they don't have
a button's shape or are invisible

00:01:06.104 --> 00:01:08.137
The button leads to an interaction.

00:01:08.983 --> 00:01:13.449
In the first videogames,
the "bad guy" didn't do much.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.408
He moved left and right,
maybe he jumped!

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:17.518
It was more control than interaction.

00:01:18.522 --> 00:01:21.900
The digital artist Jim Campbell said
something that struck me:

00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:24.625
“I feel as though
I can interact with my cat,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.425
but not with an ant.”

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:28.177
This picture explains it.

00:01:28.202 --> 00:01:31.900
This simple fact made me rethink
what I understood as interaction,

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.864
which is usually considered from
a technological point of view

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:36.355
rather than a human one.

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:40.310
From then on, I have tried to learn
as much as I can about interaction.

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:43.364
To do that I went back to its very origin.

00:01:44.474 --> 00:01:48.858
One of the clearest examples
of technology applied to interaction

00:01:48.882 --> 00:01:50.830
is the magic lantern.

00:01:50.854 --> 00:01:53.433
It was the first
image projector in history,

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:56.538
a distant relative of what we know
today as “augmented reality".

00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:01.234
It was invented by the German scholar
Athanasius Kircher in the 17th century.

00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:04.986
It was used to project images
in theatre performances.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.782
Or to project images through smoke
to create never before seen illusions,

00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:11.079
known as phantasmagoria.

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:16.600
An interesting fact is that the same
technique used to create this,

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:20.518
called “Pepper's ghost” which created
an optical illusion in three dimensions

00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:23.466
is still used today to create
holographic images.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.124
I was inspired by this idea,
light that projected images,

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:32.263
so in 2006, along with Alberto Garcia,
I developed this project

00:02:32.287 --> 00:02:34.035
“very originally” named Magic Torch,

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.186
tapping into the element
of surprise and magic.

00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:41.121
We developed this little device

00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:44.191
full of microchips, transistors,
and other electrical components

00:02:44.216 --> 00:02:47.283
that didn’t do anything
but helped to make it mysterious.

00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:49.339
Some people were
almost afraid to touch it.

00:02:49.363 --> 00:02:54.116
Once the torch was on, all sorts
of images followed the light

00:02:58.574 --> 00:02:59.644
[ MAGIC]

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.072
It was a very simple project
but I learned quite a lot.

00:03:03.097 --> 00:03:05.485
I learned that magic was the key.

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:06.976
Since magic isn’t my thing

00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.367
I focused on technology
as a means to create astonishment.

00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:14.250
In 2011, I took on a little project
called “Water Drops.”

00:03:14.274 --> 00:03:16.797
I had a hard time
naming this one as well.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.375
I installed a faucet that did not have
water running but

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.224
you could hear it dripping.

00:03:22.248 --> 00:03:25.357
If you covered the tap with
your hands, the water accumulated

00:03:25.382 --> 00:03:30.035
and once you dropped them,
you would hear the accumulated water fall.

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.807
I could bring forth that feeling of magic

00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:34.924
playing with your senses

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:38.292
and the fact that they sometimes
clash with logic and reason.

00:03:38.382 --> 00:03:43.536
(Dripping sound)

00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:47.828
Yes, I could have chosen
a more tasteful faucet

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:51.026
but it was the only one
with enough space to insert the sensors.

00:03:51.051 --> 00:03:52.090
[EXTRA-ORDINARY]

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:53.511
I learned that

00:03:53.536 --> 00:03:57.234
through technology, an ordinary
object can become extraordinary.

00:03:57.938 --> 00:04:01.366
In this project called Building Music,
making a play on words,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.926
building music as well as
having a musical building,

00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:06.920
we made a huge musical
instrument out of a building.

00:04:06.944 --> 00:04:10.410
Each window played a different
musical note or sound

00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:14.030
and with the light of a torch,
the audience could create melodies.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.208
All the music you hear
in the video was created

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:19.690
by the participants playing
with the building.

00:04:19.714 --> 00:04:22.739
(Music)

00:04:31.632 --> 00:04:34.472
It was interesting to observe how
the shape of each building

00:04:34.497 --> 00:04:37.587
and most of all, each participant
with the same notes available

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.910
created very different melodies.

00:04:39.934 --> 00:04:43.393
The beauty of designing interactive
projects is exactly that.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:46.098
The creator is always surprised,
because the participants

00:04:46.123 --> 00:04:47.639
always do something unexpected.

00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:49.786
It's guaranteed.

00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:52.206
A work of art is never complete

00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:53.231
[Artwork - Observer]

00:04:53.256 --> 00:04:55.676
until it reaches the observer.

00:04:55.701 --> 00:04:58.434
In these interactive projects,
we take it very literally:

00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:00.883
with no audience, there is no project.

00:05:00.908 --> 00:05:04.247
That is why it is imperative to make
the audience want to participate.

00:05:04.272 --> 00:05:05.294
[PLEASE, INTERACT]

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.444
The interaction must overcome that barrier

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.383
and spark curiosity, awakening the senses.

00:05:10.407 --> 00:05:12.772
For example, we all know

00:05:12.797 --> 00:05:15.161
we love to look at ourselves.

00:05:15.185 --> 00:05:17.552
We are amused by gazing
at our own reflection,

00:05:17.576 --> 00:05:19.634
or at best by our shadow.

00:05:19.658 --> 00:05:22.235
That is what lead to
Magnéticos (Magnetics),

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.307
a project where you saw yourself
reflected through your shadow

00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:27.199
and you could interact with it.

00:05:27.223 --> 00:05:30.802
In this case, household
objects that we all collect,

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:33.974
were irresistibly drawn to your shadow

00:05:33.998 --> 00:05:36.198
and turned into an outer shell.

00:05:36.222 --> 00:05:40.631
The next idea was: "sure,
we love to look at ourselves,

00:05:40.655 --> 00:05:42.992
but it’s a lot better with an audience".

00:05:43.016 --> 00:05:45.364
And why not see ourselves as the stars

00:05:45.388 --> 00:05:47.665
in one of the most visited
places in the world?

00:05:48.873 --> 00:05:53.190
In this project, giant models interacted
with pedestrians in Times Square.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.643
To give some background,
this intersection has

00:05:57.667 --> 00:06:02.433
an average of
350.000 visitors every day.

00:06:02.457 --> 00:06:07.675
Until then, people looked
at the screens

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.204
an average of less than 6 seconds.

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.391
This project multiplied
this figure by 20,

00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:14.633
now people spent more than
2 minutes watching,

00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:17.195
or rather, interacting with the screen.

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:21.952
The key was to make the participant
the center of attention,

00:06:21.976 --> 00:06:24.226
the focus of interest
in such a crowded place.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.355
The models did all sorts of things to you.

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:29.277
They could draw a picture
of you, fling you in the air,

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:31.865
they could kiss you
and turn into a frog,

00:06:32.175 --> 00:06:35.270
They could even teletransport you
to Egypt if they wanted to.

00:06:37.514 --> 00:06:41.435
So far, since the beginning
of this project in 2010

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:43.804
we have set up 30 different
types of interactions

00:06:43.828 --> 00:06:45.472
to keep surprising the public

00:06:45.496 --> 00:06:47.410
and of course we will set up more.

00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:49.836
We could call this compulsory interaction,

00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:52.630
you walk by and the model plays with you.

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.759
We recorded the models
against a green screen,

00:06:55.783 --> 00:06:58.636
then we developed
computer visual technology

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.174
that allowed us to identify
and recognize each person

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.273
that walked in front of the screen.

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:07.327
The system then mixes it all in real time
to make the interactions happen.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.223
And speaking of having an audience,

00:07:13.248 --> 00:07:15.320
many of us have dreamed
of being rock stars.

00:07:16.381 --> 00:07:20.604
And what could beat being the star of
a rock band with your friends or family?

00:07:21.557 --> 00:07:24.405
This project was installed
in a store in Times Square

00:07:24.429 --> 00:07:26.974
where we set up a photo booth

00:07:26.998 --> 00:07:28.918
that used facial recognition technology

00:07:28.942 --> 00:07:32.411
to copy your face onto a music video

00:07:32.435 --> 00:07:34.071
where you are the main character.

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:37.982
In a matter of seconds
the video was generated

00:07:38.007 --> 00:07:40.323
and projected onto
the building across the street

00:07:40.348 --> 00:07:42.941
so you could have
a knockout performance guaranteed.

00:07:44.117 --> 00:07:45.954
In order to create this music video,

00:07:45.978 --> 00:07:48.597
the musicians had special
marks on their faces

00:07:48.622 --> 00:07:51.874
to allow the facial recognition
technology to use the visitor's face,

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:53.675
like in the following clip.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.589
(Music)

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:07.175
And just as half of us have
wanted to be rock stars,

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.713
who hasn’t ever dreamed
of being a super hero?

00:08:10.343 --> 00:08:11.755
I know I have.

00:08:12.462 --> 00:08:15.503
This project goes back
to the idea of extraordinary

00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:19.009
with a very straightforward concept:

00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:23.456
you could fly over buildings
by transforming into a superhero.

00:08:26.246 --> 00:08:28.302
(Music and robotic sounds)

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:42.890
And like any superhero,
not only could you fly

00:08:42.914 --> 00:08:45.136
but also shoot laser beams,
have super speed,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.421
clone yourself and many more
superpowers inspired by classic comics.

00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:52.869
I discovered that there are many
types of superheroes among us.

00:08:53.484 --> 00:08:56.563
Some who apply themselves,

00:08:56.587 --> 00:09:00.062
Some who look forward
to the future... thoughtful.

00:09:00.086 --> 00:09:01.849
Some are happy...

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:03.663
…very happy

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.406
And some are real pros.

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:10.854
So far we have given superpowers
to 1.600 people

00:09:10.878 --> 00:09:12.779
and we hope to continue doing so.

00:09:12.803 --> 00:09:15.320
Although some may
turn into supervillains.

00:09:18.305 --> 00:09:20.994
In developing this project
we also learned that Wikipedia

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.926
has a categorized list of superpowers
that is 12 pages long,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.024
it is truly remarkable!

00:09:26.048 --> 00:09:29.169
(Applause)

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:32.487
As if it had official status, you know.

00:09:33.349 --> 00:09:35.665
Just as superhero fiction

00:09:35.689 --> 00:09:38.297
has reached Wikipedia
as a reality of our time,

00:09:38.321 --> 00:09:40.789
today we are living
in the golden age of technology.

00:09:41.157 --> 00:09:44.308
For some years now, we’ve had
cameras with software

00:09:44.332 --> 00:09:46.909
that can literally recognize
where someone is,

00:09:46.933 --> 00:09:49.336
where his arm or hand is.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.317
They can see and
understand depth in pixels.

00:09:53.278 --> 00:09:56.216
In the months to come,
the next versions of these devices

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.295
will be able to tell someone’s heartbeat
without even touching them.

00:10:00.319 --> 00:10:03.996
It is technology like this that makes
possible the projects I have shown you.

00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:08.765
But the key to all of this is not
in the technology and devices

00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:12.365
but rather the reactions caused
by the magic of technology.

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:17.472
Those reactions, the surprise,
the curiosity, the unimaginable.

00:10:17.496 --> 00:10:20.503
They are and always have been,
the driving forces of technology.

00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:24.736
We must strive to surprise ourselves
in order to keep surprising the world.

00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:25.801
(Applause)
