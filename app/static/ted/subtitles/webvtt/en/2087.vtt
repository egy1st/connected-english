00:00:00.443 --> 00:00:04.367
I am going to talk to you today
about a made-up disease.

00:00:04.391 --> 00:00:08.876
I say "made-up" because you won't find it
in any medical dictionary.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.134
The disease is called "bronzemia,"

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:14.859
and it is said that doctors who have it,

00:00:14.883 --> 00:00:20.278
as, etymologically, "bronzemia" would be
about the amount of bronze in blood,

00:00:20.302 --> 00:00:22.655
those doctors suffering from it,

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.189
as years go by,

00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:27.370
when they start to get a bronze invasion,

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.722
they start to see themselves as heroes

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:33.591
and they dream that one day
their bronze statue

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:37.460
will be placed in the hospital or clinic
in which they worked.

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:41.330
I heard this term at least 30 years ago

00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:43.202
from Dr. Feijóo Osorio,

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:45.367
a well-known doctor from Córdoba,

00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:49.739
who worked as a surgeon
at Hospital de Clínicas, here in Córdoba,

00:00:49.763 --> 00:00:54.504
in which Narciso Hernández
was also an assistant professor,

00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:58.571
because many attribute the term
"bronzemia" to Narciso Hernández.

00:00:59.316 --> 00:01:02.663
But since I discovered it,
I have used it in my teaching,

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:05.819
and the word got stuck with me forever.

00:01:05.843 --> 00:01:10.810
Narciso Hernández said
the bronzemia patient underwent 2 stages.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:14.646
The first one was "importantitis",

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.407
in which he believed to be so important
that no one was better than him.

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:22.773
The second one was "immortalitis."

00:01:23.553 --> 00:01:26.117
When the patient reached
the terminal stage

00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:28.360
and when bronze invaded his whole body,

00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:33.945
he believed then that
he was an olympic, immortal statue.

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:38.274
Where does one find this disease?

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.408
Well, generally in those places

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:43.047
that boast about their high level
of intellectuality

00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:47.851
and its ideal habitat
is undoubtedly the academia.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:50.764
Critical cases have also been found

00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:54.551
in courts, big hospitals,

00:01:54.578 --> 00:01:59.268
scientific societies, companies,

00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:02.767
in renowned sport institutions,

00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:04.498
and, forgive me for saying this,

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:08.489
as I was told during lunch yesterday,
also in the political elites.

00:02:08.513 --> 00:02:11.257
And it seems like it is precisely
in the political elites,

00:02:11.282 --> 00:02:13.679
apparently due to
a lack of historical evidence,

00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:17.565
that the arrogance and grandiosity
characteristic of the "bronzemiac"

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.874
manifest in the politician
in a spontaneous way.

00:02:23.232 --> 00:02:25.650
Another important factor is age.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.222
Generally, the first symptoms appear
at the ages of 45, 55,

00:02:31.246 --> 00:02:34.006
but the most serious cases

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.092
happen between the ages of 55 and 65,

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:38.668
which is when men,

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:41.676
in their desire to expound on
and talk about things

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:46.775
that they have read about
in a generally shallow way

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.370
is in inverse relation to their age

00:02:49.394 --> 00:02:54.229
and their ability to understand
and discern.

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.841
Gender is also important.

00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:01.608
It was believed
that it was mainly a male thing;

00:03:01.632 --> 00:03:04.483
but I think that now
with the surge of feminism,

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:09.487
if we were to do new, specific statistics,

00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:13.695
we would find a great number
of women with bronzemia.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:19.286
And all authors agree
that bronzemia in women

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.770
has always been an extremely serious case

00:03:21.794 --> 00:03:24.274
that is practically incurable.

00:03:24.298 --> 00:03:25.763
(Laughter)

00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:30.053
There are 3 main common symptoms
of the bronzemiac:

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:32.590
mental diarrhea,

00:03:32.614 --> 00:03:33.871
(Laughter)

00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:36.040
conversational deafness

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.223
and the cephalocaudal reflex.

00:03:40.843 --> 00:03:44.726
Mental diarrhea is characterized
by exaggerated verbosity

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.880
in which the bronzemiac talks endlessly
about everything his brain defecates.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.284
The patient generally speaks upright

00:03:54.308 --> 00:04:01.370
as if they were talking
from a pulpit or at a lectern.

00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:05.036
Conversational deafness
always accompanies mental diarrhea.

00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:09.593
When the patient talks,
and talks, and talks,

00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:12.184
his ears do not listen to anything.

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:15.667
When the bronzemiac talks,
he listens to nobody.

00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:17.741
And the cephalocaudal reflex

00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:20.672
gives him that peculiar stride

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:25.734
with his head held high, an erected butt
due to the bronze impregnation,

00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:28.925
and some authors say

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.839
that bronze first starts
to accumulate in their feet

00:04:33.863 --> 00:04:37.369
and then goes up
until it reaches the brain.

00:04:37.393 --> 00:04:39.005
If this were true,

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.129
it would probably justify the fact

00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:44.610
that bronzemiacs,
as soon as the disease starts,

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:48.615
instead of walking,
transpose themselves elegantly.

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.749
(Laughter)

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.845
I thought that bronzemia
was a current thing,

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:59.013
but it's not.

00:04:59.038 --> 00:05:00.335
Let me tell you about it.

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:03.036
Around the year 1500 B.C.,

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.008
in ancient India, society was divided

00:05:09.032 --> 00:05:10.969
into 5 castes,

00:05:10.993 --> 00:05:15.584
with the Untouchables as the fifth one.

00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:18.208
They did not have any kind of right,

00:05:18.232 --> 00:05:20.894
not even the right to medical care.

00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:22.676
The fourth caste

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.836
was that of lower workers,

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.495
the third one was that of the merchants,

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:32.737
the second caste
was the caste of the Anvasta,

00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:34.758
to which doctors belonged,

00:05:34.782 --> 00:05:37.367
and the first caste were the kings.

00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:38.669
These two,

00:05:38.693 --> 00:05:40.776
the first and second castes,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.089
claimed they descended from the gods.

00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:45.925
I believe that perhaps
some of the doctors with bronzemia

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.756
really do believe they come from the gods.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.808
Later in the history of medicine,

00:05:51.832 --> 00:05:54.220
we have the famous Galen.

00:05:54.244 --> 00:05:58.343
Galen of Pergamon was a doctor
in Imperial Rome

00:05:58.367 --> 00:06:02.838
in the year 162, and he was a bronzemiac,

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.758
an incorrigible egomaniac.

00:06:04.782 --> 00:06:07.672
He would constantly
talk about his great income,

00:06:07.696 --> 00:06:10.720
his fame,

00:06:10.744 --> 00:06:16.327
and when he cured patients,
he made it seem like something miraculous

00:06:16.351 --> 00:06:19.758
so people would be even more impressed.

00:06:19.782 --> 00:06:21.841
But in modern times,

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:23.936
I am sure that all of us,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.612
in our place of work,

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.670
whatever that may be,

00:06:28.694 --> 00:06:32.297
I'm sure that we have to coexist
with bronzemiacs.

00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:36.760
I would like to tell you something
very specific and ahead of time.

00:06:36.784 --> 00:06:42.842
Many authors say one of the first symptoms
that bronzemiacs get

00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:46.973
is starting to lose the ability to smile.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.486
I will not keep talking
about the symptoms of bronzemia

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.044
but I believe
it is important to say in this talk

00:07:02.068 --> 00:07:06.281
what we can do to prevent
our young doctors

00:07:06.305 --> 00:07:10.001
or our young people
from getting bronzemia.

00:07:10.025 --> 00:07:12.847
I believe that we can only,

00:07:12.871 --> 00:07:15.450
with all our effort,

00:07:15.474 --> 00:07:19.335
try to fill their brains, their minds,

00:07:19.359 --> 00:07:21.865
with the desire to help their colleagues,

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:23.396
their collaborators,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.397
their patients.

00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:27.486
To sow within them

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.363
the spirit of service, so it can blossom.

00:07:31.387 --> 00:07:35.202
And I want to state the difference
between service and the spirit of service.

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:36.812
I remember that many years ago

00:07:36.837 --> 00:07:40.576
when I was working on my doctorate thesis
in the experimental surgery room,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.928
I saw a rabbit pulling the stitches
out of another rabbit's back.

00:07:45.952 --> 00:07:49.413
We had operated on its back.

00:07:49.437 --> 00:07:52.786
This behaviour, an animal pulling out
another one's stitches,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.669
is not strange in the animal kingdom.

00:07:54.693 --> 00:07:56.557
Even animals from different species

00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:59.565
pull thorns or strange bodies
out of one another.

00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:01.706
What this rabbit was doing

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.050
was a service to the other rabbit.

00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:07.510
Because that is what service is.

00:08:07.534 --> 00:08:11.926
It's an act which can be instinctive
and lacking thought.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.917
On the other hand, the spirit of service

00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:20.010
is the profound desire to satisfy
those who need us.

00:08:20.034 --> 00:08:24.322
It's not an act; it's an attitude,
a function of life.

00:08:25.342 --> 00:08:27.202
If young doctors

00:08:27.226 --> 00:08:32.037
are not training to take in passionately
the spirit of service,

00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:37.145
they are training themselves
to catch bronzemia.

00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:40.087
We were talking about
the spirit of service,

00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:42.464
and the way to encourage it,

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:48.606
but I cannot decree these things
to my young doctors.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.742
I cannot tell them

00:08:49.766 --> 00:08:51.570
"As of tomorrow, think this way."

00:08:51.594 --> 00:08:55.829
"As of tomorrow,
start loving your patients."

00:08:55.853 --> 00:08:57.242
That is not possible,

00:08:57.266 --> 00:09:00.051
but we can help them
by being an example every day,

00:09:00.075 --> 00:09:03.719
so that it can take root in their hearts,

00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:06.994
in their most urgent desire

00:09:07.018 --> 00:09:10.056
to help their colleagues, their patients.

00:09:10.515 --> 00:09:13.436
I am going to tell you a story,
so that you can remember this.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.315
There is a famous painter

00:09:15.339 --> 00:09:22.067
who had had an exhibition called
"The doors of the heart."

00:09:22.091 --> 00:09:24.718
It was about doors of different colors.

00:09:24.742 --> 00:09:27.200
The exhibition was a success,

00:09:27.224 --> 00:09:30.815
beautiful doors, mixed colors,

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:33.409
but there was someone in the room

00:09:33.433 --> 00:09:35.096
who'd stand in each door,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.273
look at it and move on to the next one.

00:09:38.633 --> 00:09:41.041
Suddenly, he stands in front of one.

00:09:41.065 --> 00:09:44.403
The painter is right next to him.

00:09:44.427 --> 00:09:46.878
So, he humbly says:

00:09:46.902 --> 00:09:51.686
"Excuse me, you see,
the doors you paint are beautiful,

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.296
but I'm a locksmith

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.970
and I'd like to give you
my humble opinion.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.388
I see that your doors have no handles,

00:09:59.412 --> 00:10:00.990
how do you open them?"

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:02.337
And the painter says:

00:10:02.361 --> 00:10:05.021
"See, I've been thinking about it
for many years

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.318
but the doors of the heart
have no latch outside

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:12.389
because they are only
opened from the inside."

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:15.193
I am sure that

00:10:16.223 --> 00:10:19.446
you have coexisted
with bronzemia-infected doctors,

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.304
and I imagine that any of you
can come up here

00:10:22.328 --> 00:10:26.155
and tell us about your experience
with a bronzemia patient

00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:28.238
of any profession.

00:10:28.262 --> 00:10:31.692
I am going to tell you
what Bernie was asked,

00:10:31.716 --> 00:10:35.233
despite being a pioneer
of the mind-body medicine,

00:10:35.257 --> 00:10:38.233
by three terminal patients,

00:10:38.257 --> 00:10:40.574
young people who died a few days later

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.245
when Bernie told them:

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:46.150
"What do you want me
to say to the young doctors?

00:10:46.174 --> 00:10:49.901
Because now I have to speak
at their graduation ceremony.

00:10:49.925 --> 00:10:51.972
What message do you want me to give them?"

00:10:53.368 --> 00:10:55.353
These patients told him:

00:10:55.993 --> 00:10:59.087
"To knock on the door
before coming into our room,

00:11:00.107 --> 00:11:04.079
to wave and say goodbye
to us when they leave,

00:11:04.729 --> 00:11:07.975
and to look at us in our eyes
when they speak to us."

00:11:08.705 --> 00:11:13.609
None of them asked
to find a cure for their disease,

00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:19.391
they only asked for respect,
they only wanted respect.

00:11:19.415 --> 00:11:24.010
And I end this talk with that impasse
characteristic of my age.

00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:27.685
I am going to tell you a true story.

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:30.057
It takes place in an operating room,

00:11:30.081 --> 00:11:31.885
during long surgery.

00:11:31.909 --> 00:11:33.745
The surgery is taking long,

00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:37.139
and suddenly, one of the nurses
has to be replaced

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:38.776
and as she is leaving,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.195
she walks behind the surgeon,

00:11:41.219 --> 00:11:44.910
a man renowned for his spirit of service.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.548
She walks behind him,

00:11:47.572 --> 00:11:51.220
strokes his back,
gives him a kiss and leaves.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.270
To the surgeon, this was a beautiful gift.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:03.693
A beautiful gift because this included
all the pain and love

00:12:03.717 --> 00:12:07.302
that the doctor and the nurse
had felt together

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:10.556
and shared in the operating room.

00:12:11.836 --> 00:12:15.442
This gave the doctor the strength to go on

00:12:15.466 --> 00:12:18.687
and as another surgeon,
who is a friend of mine, said:

00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:22.668
"That surgeon's heart
was filled with music."

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:25.939
The godlike doctors,

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:30.954
those doctors who have breakfast with God

00:12:30.978 --> 00:12:34.889
and then come down to see their patients,

00:12:34.913 --> 00:12:37.302
these doctors with bronzemia,

00:12:37.326 --> 00:12:39.803
or brozemiacs in any line of work,

00:12:39.827 --> 00:12:44.279
doing any activity,
from any socio-cultural level,

00:12:44.303 --> 00:12:46.619
cannot get such gifts

00:12:47.789 --> 00:12:52.900
because they feel so superior
to everyone else around them

00:12:52.924 --> 00:12:55.808
that they are incapable
of sharing anything.

00:12:55.832 --> 00:12:57.159
Thank you.

00:12:57.183 --> 00:13:01.181
(Applause)
