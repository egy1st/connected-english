00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:02.366
What do you guys think?

00:00:02.706 --> 00:00:07.180
For those who watched
Sir Ken's memorable TED Talk,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.322
I am a typical example 
of what he describes

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:12.956
as "the body as a form
of transport for the head,"

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.737
a university professor.

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:19.217
You might think it was not fair

00:00:19.217 --> 00:00:22.180
that I've been lined up to speak
after these first two talks

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.124
to speak about science.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:28.272
I can't move my body to the beat,

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:31.184
and after a scientist
who became a philosopher,

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:33.126
I have to talk about hard science.

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:36.154
It could be a very dry subject.

00:00:36.154 --> 00:00:39.679
Yet, I feel honored.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.462
Never in my career,

00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:43.023
and it's been a long career,

00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:45.256
have I had the opportunity to start a talk

00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:48.264
feeling so inspired, like this one.

00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:52.144
Usually, talking about science

00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:55.304
is like exercising in a dry place.

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:59.516
However, I've had the pleasure

00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:02.895
of being invited to come here
to talk about water.

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:06.768
The words "water" and "dry"
do not match, right?

00:01:07.426 --> 00:01:10.916
It is even better to talk about
water in the Amazon,

00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:15.950
which is the splendid cradle 
of life. Fresh life.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.028
So this is what inspired me.

00:01:18.028 --> 00:01:20.230
That's why I'm here,
although I'm carrying

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.143
my head over here.

00:01:22.143 --> 00:01:26.237
I am trying, or will try to convey
this inspiration.

00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:30.097
I hope this story will inspire you
and that you'll spread the word.

00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:35.637
We know that there is controversy.

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.160
The Amazon is the "lung of the world,"

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.426
because of its massive power
to have vital gases exchanged

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:46.245
between the forest and the atmosphere.

00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:50.345
We also hear about
the storehouse of biodiversity.

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:54.651
While many believe it,

00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:56.197
few know it.

00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:58.075
If you go out there, in this marsh,

00:01:58.075 --> 00:02:01.913
you'll be amazed at the --

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.957
You can barely see the animals.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:08.011
The Indians say, "The forest
has more eyes than leaves."

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:10.987
That is true, and I will try
to show you something.

00:02:10.987 --> 00:02:14.168
But today, I'm going to use
a different approach,

00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:17.188
one that is inspired by these
two initiatives here,

00:02:17.188 --> 00:02:19.869
a harmonic one and a philosophical one.

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.998
I'll try to use an approach
that's slightly materialistic,

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:27.216
but it also attempts to convey
that, in nature, there is

00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:30.310
extraordinary philosophy and harmony.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.271
There'll be no music in my presentation,

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:36.494
but I hope you'll all notice the music
of the reality I'm going to show you.

00:02:36.494 --> 00:02:39.107
I'm going to talk about physiology â€”
not about lungs,

00:02:39.107 --> 00:02:42.635
but other analogies with human physiology,

00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:44.744
especially the heart.

00:02:44.744 --> 00:02:46.762
We'll start

00:02:49.132 --> 00:02:53.720
by thinking that water is like blood.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.349
The circulation in our body
distributes fresh blood,

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.959
which feeds, nurtures and supports us,

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.337
and brings the used blood back
to be renewed.

00:03:06.337 --> 00:03:10.659
In the Amazon, things happen similarly.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.766
We'll start by talking about
the power of all these processes.

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:20.387
This is an image

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:23.198
of rain in motion.

00:03:23.198 --> 00:03:27.211
What you see there
is the years passing in seconds.

00:03:27.211 --> 00:03:30.159
Rains all over the world.
What do you see?

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.019
The equatorial region, in general,

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.882
and the Amazon specifically,

00:03:33.882 --> 00:03:36.751
is extremely important
for the world's climate.

00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:38.916
It's a powerful engine.

00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:44.212
There is a frantic evaporation
taking place here.

00:03:44.212 --> 00:03:46.834
If we take a look at this other image,

00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:49.616
which shows the water vapor flow,

00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:52.801
you have dry air in black,
moist air in gray,

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:54.232
and clouds in white.

00:03:54.232 --> 00:03:59.908
What you see there is an extraordinary
resurgence in the Amazon.

00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:02.031
What phenomenon -- if it's not a desert,

00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:07.277
what phenomenon makes water
gush from the ground into the atmosphere

00:04:07.277 --> 00:04:10.360
with such power 
that it can be seen from space?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.902
What phenomenon is this?

00:04:11.902 --> 00:04:14.770
It could be a geyser.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.558
A geyser is underground water
heated by magma,

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:19.998
exploding into the atmosphere

00:04:19.998 --> 00:04:23.668
and transferring this water 
into the atmosphere.

00:04:23.668 --> 00:04:26.534
There are no geysers in the Amazon,
unless I am wrong.

00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:28.502
I don't know of any.

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:32.906
But we have something
that plays the same role,

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:36.298
with much more elegance though:

00:04:36.298 --> 00:04:39.194
the trees, our good old friends

00:04:39.194 --> 00:04:42.008
that, like geysers,

00:04:42.008 --> 00:04:47.086
can transfer an enormous amount of water
from the ground into the atmosphere.

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:52.783
There are 600 billion trees
in the Amazon forest, 600 billion geysers.

00:04:52.783 --> 00:04:56.646
That is done with
an extraordinary sophistication.

00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:58.291
They don't need the heat of magma.

00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:01.262
They use sunlight to do this process.

00:05:01.262 --> 00:05:04.793
So, in a typical sunny day in the Amazon,

00:05:04.793 --> 00:05:07.723
a big tree manages
to transfer 1,000 liters of water

00:05:07.723 --> 00:05:10.032
through its transpiration --

00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:11.447
1,000 liters.

00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:16.642
If we take all the Amazon,

00:05:16.642 --> 00:05:18.505
which is a very large area,

00:05:18.505 --> 00:05:21.785
and add it up to all that water
that is released by transpiration,

00:05:21.785 --> 00:05:24.291
which is the sweat of the forest,

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:26.985
we'll get to an incredible number:

00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:29.781
20 billion metric tons of water.

00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:31.375
In one day.

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.562
Do you know how much that is?

00:05:33.562 --> 00:05:36.122
The Amazon River,
the largest river on Earth,

00:05:36.122 --> 00:05:37.703
one fifth of all the fresh water

00:05:37.703 --> 00:05:41.152
that leaves the continents of the
whole world and ends up in the oceans,

00:05:41.152 --> 00:05:45.562
dumps 17 billion metric tons
of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:45.562 --> 00:05:46.811
This river of vapor

00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:49.706
that comes up from the forest
and goes into the atmosphere

00:05:49.706 --> 00:05:51.310
is greater than the Amazon River.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.187
Just to give you an idea.

00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:56.743
If we could take a gigantic kettle,

00:05:56.743 --> 00:05:59.642
the kind you could plug into
a power socket, an electric one,

00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:02.140
and put those 20 billion
metric tons of water in it,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.490
how much power would you need
to have this water evaporated?

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.247
Any idea? A really big kettle.

00:06:08.247 --> 00:06:10.432
A gigantic kettle, right?

00:06:10.432 --> 00:06:12.518
50 thousand Itaipus.

00:06:12.518 --> 00:06:16.264
Itaipu is still the largest
hydroelectric plant in the world.

00:06:16.264 --> 00:06:17.937
and Brazil is very proud of it

00:06:17.937 --> 00:06:20.136
because it provides more 
than 30 percent of the power

00:06:20.136 --> 00:06:22.093
that is consumed in Brazil.

00:06:22.093 --> 00:06:26.785
And the Amazon is here,
doing this for free.

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:31.957
It's a vivid and extremely powerful plant,
providing environmental services.

00:06:34.047 --> 00:06:35.608
Related to this subject,

00:06:35.608 --> 00:06:38.596
we are going to talk about
what I call the paradox of chance,

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:40.764
which is curious.

00:06:40.764 --> 00:06:42.476
If you look at the world map --

00:06:42.476 --> 00:06:43.835
it's easy to see this --

00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:46.904
you'll see that there are forests
in the equatorial zone,

00:06:46.904 --> 00:06:50.116
and deserts are organized
at 30 degrees north latitude,

00:06:50.116 --> 00:06:53.199
30 degrees south latitude, aligned.

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:56.243
Look over there, in the southern
hemisphere, the Atacama;

00:06:56.243 --> 00:06:58.840
Namibia and Kalahari in Africa;
the Australian desert.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.994
In the northern hemisphere,
the Sahara, Sonoran, etc.

00:07:01.994 --> 00:07:06.433
There is an exception, and it's curious:

00:07:06.433 --> 00:07:09.520
It's the quadrangle that ranges from
CuiabÃ¡ to Buenos Aires,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.323
and from SÃ£o Paulo to the Andes.

00:07:11.323 --> 00:07:14.437
This quadrangle
was supposed to be a desert.

00:07:14.437 --> 00:07:16.746
It's on the line of deserts.

00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:20.010
Why isn't it? That's why
I call it the paradox of chance.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.449
What do we have in South America
that is different?

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:26.448
If we could use the analogy

00:07:26.448 --> 00:07:30.580
of the blood circulating in our bodies,

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.662
like the water
circulating in the landscape,

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:37.788
we see that rivers are veins,

00:07:37.788 --> 00:07:42.333
they drain the landscape,
they drain the tissue of nature.

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:44.288
Where are the arteries?

00:07:44.288 --> 00:07:46.323
Any guess?

00:07:46.323 --> 00:07:48.139
What takes --

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:53.402
How does water get to irrigate
the tissues of nature

00:07:53.402 --> 00:07:56.585
and bring everything back through rivers?

00:07:56.585 --> 00:07:59.606
There is a new type of river,

00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:02.897
which originates in the blue sea,

00:08:02.897 --> 00:08:06.247
which flows through the green ocean --

00:08:06.247 --> 00:08:09.244
it not only flows, but it is also
pumped by the green ocean --

00:08:09.244 --> 00:08:12.299
and then it falls on our land.

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:14.507
All our economy, that quadrangle,

00:08:14.507 --> 00:08:19.037
70 percent of South America's 
GDP comes from that area.

00:08:19.037 --> 00:08:20.675
It depends on this river.

00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:22.727
This river flows invisibly above us.

00:08:22.727 --> 00:08:24.915
We are floating here
on this floating hotel,

00:08:24.915 --> 00:08:27.870
on one of the largest rivers on Earth,
the Negro River.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.259
It's a bit dry and rough,
but we are floating here,

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:34.349
and there is this
invisible river running above us.

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:37.516
This river has a pulse.

00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:39.939
Here it is, pulsing.

00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:42.327
That's why we also talk about the heart.

00:08:42.327 --> 00:08:44.462
You can see the different seasons there.

00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:47.823
There's the rainy season. In the Amazon,
we used to have two seasons,

00:08:47.823 --> 00:08:50.306
the humid season
and the even more humid season.

00:08:50.306 --> 00:08:51.962
Now we have a dry season.

00:08:51.962 --> 00:08:54.671
You can see the river covering that region

00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:58.444
which, otherwise, would be a desert.
And it is not.

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:05.151
We, scientists --
You see that I'm struggling here

00:09:05.151 --> 00:09:07.634
to move my head
from one side to the other.

00:09:07.634 --> 00:09:13.031
Scientists study how it works, why, etc.

00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:17.718
and these studies
are generating a series of discoveries,

00:09:17.718 --> 00:09:19.290
which are absolutely fabulous,

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.283
to raise our awareness of the wealth,

00:09:22.283 --> 00:09:24.668
the complexity,
and the wonder that we have,

00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:27.649
the symphony we have in this process.

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:29.997
One of them is: How is rain formed?

00:09:29.997 --> 00:09:33.522
Above the Amazon, there is clean air,

00:09:33.522 --> 00:09:35.440
as there is clean air above the ocean.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.493
The blue sea has clean air above it
and forms pretty few clouds;

00:09:38.493 --> 00:09:39.952
there's almost no rain there.

00:09:39.952 --> 00:09:44.366
The green ocean has the same clean air,
but forms a lot of rain.

00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:46.753
What is happening here that is different?

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.423
The forest emits smells,

00:09:48.423 --> 00:09:51.361
and these smells are condensation nuclei,

00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:53.625
which form drops in the atmosphere.

00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:58.503
Then, clouds are formed
and there is torrential rain.

00:09:58.503 --> 00:10:01.180
The sprinkler of the Garden of Eden.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.712
This relation between a living thing,
which is the forest,

00:10:06.712 --> 00:10:09.856
and a nonliving thing,
which is the atmosphere,

00:10:09.856 --> 00:10:12.133
is ingenious in the Amazon,

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:17.464
because the forest provides
water and seeds,

00:10:17.464 --> 00:10:20.449
and the atmosphere forms the rain
and gives water back,

00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:23.961
guaranteeing the forest's survival.

00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:25.950
There are other factors as well.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.764
We've talked a little about the heart,

00:10:27.764 --> 00:10:30.654
and let's now talk about
another function: the liver!

00:10:30.654 --> 00:10:35.715
When humid air, high humidity
and radiation are combined

00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:37.775
with these organic compounds,

00:10:37.775 --> 00:10:43.487
which I call exogenous vitamin C,
generous vitamin C in the form of gas,

00:10:43.487 --> 00:10:46.317
the plants release antioxidants

00:10:46.317 --> 00:10:48.637
which react with pollutants.

00:10:48.637 --> 00:10:50.041
You can rest assured

00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:53.538
that you are breathing the purest air
on Earth, here in the Amazon,

00:10:53.538 --> 00:10:57.045
because the plants take care
of this characteristic as well.

00:10:57.045 --> 00:10:59.662
This benefits the very way plants work,

00:10:59.662 --> 00:11:01.715
which is another ingenious cycle.

00:11:01.715 --> 00:11:05.569
Speaking of fractals,

00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:07.905
and their relation with the way we work,

00:11:07.905 --> 00:11:10.493
we can establish other comparisons.

00:11:10.493 --> 00:11:14.024
As in the upper airways of our lungs,

00:11:14.024 --> 00:11:17.736
the air in the Amazon
gets cleaned up from the excess of dust.

00:11:17.736 --> 00:11:21.714
The dust in the air that we breathe
is cleaned by our airways.

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:25.533
This keeps the excess of dust
from affecting the rainfall.

00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:27.380
When there are fires in the Amazon,

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.224
the smoke stops the rain, 
it stops raining,

00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:32.426
the forest dries up and catches fire.

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:35.057
There is another fractal analogy.

00:11:35.057 --> 00:11:37.009
Like in the veins and arteries,

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:39.805
the rain water is a feedback.

00:11:39.805 --> 00:11:41.834
It returns to the atmosphere.

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:46.120
Like endocrinal glands and hormones,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.863
there are those gases
which I told you about before,

00:11:48.863 --> 00:11:52.495
that are formed and released
into the atmosphere, like hormones,

00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:54.810
which help in the formation of rain.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.435
Like the liver and the kidneys,
as I've said, cleaning the air.

00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:01.234
And, finally, like the heart:

00:12:01.234 --> 00:12:06.307
pumping water from outside, from the sea,

00:12:06.307 --> 00:12:08.179
into the forest.

00:12:08.179 --> 00:12:11.581
We call it the biotic moisture pump,

00:12:11.581 --> 00:12:15.731
a new theory that is explained
in a very simple way.

00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:18.389
If there is a desert in the continent

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:20.477
with a nearby sea,

00:12:20.477 --> 00:12:22.311
evaporation's greater on the sea,

00:12:22.311 --> 00:12:25.280
and it sucks the air above the desert.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.762
The desert is trapped in this condition.
It will always be dry.

00:12:28.762 --> 00:12:31.528
If you have
the opposite situation, a forest,

00:12:31.528 --> 00:12:35.266
the evaporation, as we showed,
is much greater, because of the trees,

00:12:35.266 --> 00:12:36.978
and this relation is reversed.

00:12:36.978 --> 00:12:39.331
The air above the sea
is sucked into the continent

00:12:39.331 --> 00:12:42.179
and humidity is imported.

00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:46.676
This satellite image
was taken one month ago â€”

00:12:46.676 --> 00:12:49.063
that's Manaus down there,
we're down there â€”

00:12:49.063 --> 00:12:50.418
and it shows this process.

00:12:50.418 --> 00:12:53.462
It's not a common little river
that flows into a canal.

00:12:53.462 --> 00:12:58.192
It's a mighty river
that irrigates South America,

00:12:58.192 --> 00:13:00.016
among other things.

00:13:00.016 --> 00:13:02.333
This image shows those paths,

00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:05.638
all the hurricanes
that have been recorded.

00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:10.208
You can see that, in the red square,
there hardly are any hurricanes.

00:13:10.208 --> 00:13:11.786
That is no accident.

00:13:11.786 --> 00:13:15.250
This pump that sucks
the moisture into the continent

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.485
also speeds up the air above the sea,

00:13:17.485 --> 00:13:20.343
and this prevents hurricane formations.

00:13:21.053 --> 00:13:25.645
To close this part and sum up,

00:13:25.645 --> 00:13:28.265
I'd like to talk about
something a little different.

00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:30.225
I have several colleagues

00:13:30.225 --> 00:13:32.710
who worked in the development
of these theories.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.341
They think, and so do I,

00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:38.939
that we can save planet Earth.

00:13:38.939 --> 00:13:41.684
I'm not talking only about the Amazon.

00:13:41.684 --> 00:13:43.809
The Amazon teaches us a lesson

00:13:43.809 --> 00:13:47.845
on how pristine nature works.

00:13:47.845 --> 00:13:50.251
We didn't understand
these processes before

00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:53.086
because the rest of the world
is messed up.

00:13:53.086 --> 00:13:54.993
We could understand it here, though.

00:13:54.993 --> 00:13:58.370
These colleagues propose
that, yes, we can

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.077
save other areas,

00:14:00.077 --> 00:14:02.172
including deserts.

00:14:02.172 --> 00:14:05.597
If we could establish forests
in those other areas,

00:14:05.597 --> 00:14:07.709
we can reverse climate change,

00:14:07.709 --> 00:14:10.324
including global warming.

00:14:10.324 --> 00:14:12.540
I have a dear colleague in India,

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.614
whose name is Suprabha Seshan,
and she has a motto.

00:14:15.614 --> 00:14:19.928
Her motto is,
"Gardening back the biosphere,"

00:14:19.928 --> 00:14:22.286
"Reajardinando a biosfera" in Portuguese.

00:14:22.286 --> 00:14:25.284
She does a wonderful job
rebuilding ecosystems.

00:14:25.284 --> 00:14:27.851
We need to do this.

00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:32.036
Having closed this quick introduction,

00:14:32.036 --> 00:14:35.622
we see the reality that we have out here,

00:14:35.622 --> 00:14:38.632
which is drought, this climate change,

00:14:38.632 --> 00:14:40.515
things that we already knew.

00:14:40.515 --> 00:14:43.499
I'd like to tell you a short story.

00:14:44.649 --> 00:14:48.282
Once, about four years ago,

00:14:48.282 --> 00:14:52.169
I attended a declamation,
of a text by Davi Kopenawa,

00:14:52.169 --> 00:14:55.267
a wise representative
of the Yanomami people,

00:14:55.267 --> 00:14:57.462
and it went more or less like this:

00:14:57.462 --> 00:15:00.087
"Doesn't the white man know

00:15:00.087 --> 00:15:03.478
that, if he destroys the forest,
there will be no more rain?

00:15:03.478 --> 00:15:05.241
And that, if there's no more rain,

00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:08.464
there'll be nothing to drink, or to eat?"

00:15:08.464 --> 00:15:11.145
I heard that, and my eyes welled up

00:15:11.145 --> 00:15:12.588
and I went, "Oh, my!

00:15:12.588 --> 00:15:16.464
I've been studying this for 20 years,
with a super computer,

00:15:16.904 --> 00:15:19.034
dozens, thousands of scientists,

00:15:19.034 --> 00:15:22.712
and we are starting to get to this
conclusion, which he already knows!"

00:15:22.712 --> 00:15:27.746
A critical point is the Yanomami
have never deforested.

00:15:27.746 --> 00:15:30.385
How could they know the rain would end?

00:15:30.385 --> 00:15:34.327
This bugged me and I was befuddled.

00:15:34.327 --> 00:15:35.773
How could he know that?

00:15:35.773 --> 00:15:39.536
Some months later,
I met him at another event and said,

00:15:39.536 --> 00:15:45.342
"Davi, how did you know that if the forest
was destroyed, there'd be no more rain?"

00:15:45.342 --> 00:15:50.157
He replied:
"The spirit of the forest told us."

00:15:50.157 --> 00:15:54.744
For me, this was a game changer,

00:15:54.744 --> 00:15:56.447
a radical change.

00:15:56.447 --> 00:15:57.866
I said, "Gosh!

00:15:57.866 --> 00:16:02.105
Why am I doing all this science

00:16:02.105 --> 00:16:05.167
to get to a conclusion
that he already knows?"

00:16:05.167 --> 00:16:11.174
Then, something 
absolutely critical hit me,

00:16:11.174 --> 00:16:13.127
which is,

00:16:15.697 --> 00:16:19.072
seeing is believing.

00:16:19.932 --> 00:16:23.140
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.928
This is a need the previous speaker
pointed out:

00:16:27.928 --> 00:16:30.712
We need to see things --

00:16:30.712 --> 00:16:32.900
I mean, we, Western society,

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.262
which is becoming global, civilized --

00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:36.665
we need to see.

00:16:36.665 --> 00:16:39.188
If we don't see,
we don't register the information.

00:16:39.188 --> 00:16:40.932
We live in ignorance.

00:16:40.932 --> 00:16:42.822
So, I propose the following --

00:16:42.822 --> 00:16:45.274
of course, the astronomer
wouldn't like the idea --

00:16:45.274 --> 00:16:48.130
but let's turn the Hubble telescope
upside down.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.547
And let's make it look down here,

00:16:50.547 --> 00:16:52.797
rather than to the far reaches
of the universe.

00:16:52.797 --> 00:16:54.539
The universe is wonderful,

00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:56.914
but we have a practical reality,

00:16:56.914 --> 00:17:00.734
which is we live in an unknown cosmos,

00:17:00.734 --> 00:17:02.117
and we're ignorant about it.

00:17:02.117 --> 00:17:05.787
We're trampling on this wonderful cosmos

00:17:05.787 --> 00:17:07.826
that shelters us and houses us.

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:09.492
Talk to any astrophysicist.

00:17:09.492 --> 00:17:12.778
The Earth is a statistical improbability.

00:17:12.778 --> 00:17:16.976
The stability and comfort that we enjoy,
despite the droughts of the Negro River,

00:17:16.976 --> 00:17:19.939
and all the heat and cold
and typhoons, etc.,

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:22.673
there is nothing like it in the universe,
that we know of.

00:17:22.673 --> 00:17:24.922
Then, let's turn Hubble in our direction,

00:17:24.922 --> 00:17:28.951
and let's look at the Earth.

00:17:29.431 --> 00:17:31.541
Let's start with the Amazon!

00:17:31.541 --> 00:17:32.920
Let's dive,

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.466
let's reach out the reality
we live in every day,

00:17:37.466 --> 00:17:40.693
and look carefully at it,
since that's what we need.

00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:42.624
Davi Kopenawa doesn't need this.

00:17:42.624 --> 00:17:45.003
He has something already
that I think I missed.

00:17:45.003 --> 00:17:46.678
I was educated by television.

00:17:46.678 --> 00:17:48.589
I think that I missed this,

00:17:48.589 --> 00:17:50.484
an ancestral record,

00:17:50.484 --> 00:17:54.864
a valuation of what I don't know,
what I haven't seen.

00:17:54.864 --> 00:17:56.986
He is not a doubting Thomas.

00:17:56.986 --> 00:18:00.192
He believes, 
with veneration and reverence,

00:18:00.192 --> 00:18:03.563
in what his ancestors
and the spirits taught him.

00:18:03.563 --> 00:18:06.337
We can't do it,
so let's look into the forest.

00:18:06.337 --> 00:18:09.543
Even with Hubble up there --

00:18:09.543 --> 00:18:11.888
this is a bird's-eye view, right?

00:18:11.888 --> 00:18:13.758
Even when this happens,

00:18:13.758 --> 00:18:16.862
we also see something that we don't know.

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:19.148
The Spanish called it the green inferno.

00:18:19.148 --> 00:18:22.018
If you go out there
into the bushes and get lost,

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:24.256
and, let's say, if you head west,

00:18:24.256 --> 00:18:26.225
it's 900 kilometers to Colombia,

00:18:26.225 --> 00:18:28.162
and another 1,000 to somewhere else.

00:18:28.162 --> 00:18:31.309
So, you can figure out
why they called it the green inferno.

00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:34.563
But go and look at what is in there.

00:18:34.563 --> 00:18:36.054
It is a live carpet.

00:18:36.054 --> 00:18:38.350
Each color you see is a tree species.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.135
Each tree, each tree top,

00:18:40.135 --> 00:18:44.691
has up to 10,000 species of insects in it,

00:18:44.691 --> 00:18:48.749
let alone the millions of species
of fungi, bacteria, etc.

00:18:48.749 --> 00:18:50.401
All invisible.

00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:53.645
All of it is an even stranger cosmos to us

00:18:53.645 --> 00:18:56.554
than the galaxies billions
of light years away from the Earth,

00:18:56.554 --> 00:18:59.983
which Hubble brings
to our newspapers everyday.

00:19:00.983 --> 00:19:02.853
I'm going to end my talk here --

00:19:02.853 --> 00:19:04.664
I have a few seconds left --

00:19:04.664 --> 00:19:06.708
by showing you this wonderful being.

00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:09.596
When we see the morpho butterfly
in the forest,

00:19:09.596 --> 00:19:12.431
we feel like someone's left open
the door to heaven,

00:19:12.431 --> 00:19:15.632
and this creature escaped from there,
because it's so beautiful.

00:19:15.632 --> 00:19:18.017
However, I cannot finish

00:19:18.017 --> 00:19:20.548
without showing you a tech side.

00:19:20.548 --> 00:19:23.758
We are tech-arrogant.

00:19:23.758 --> 00:19:27.049
We deprive nature of its technology.

00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:28.773
A robotic hand is technological,

00:19:28.773 --> 00:19:30.150
mine is biological,

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.913
and we don't think about it anymore.

00:19:31.913 --> 00:19:34.015
Let's then look at the morpho butterfly,

00:19:34.015 --> 00:19:39.456
an example of an invisible
technological competence of life,

00:19:39.456 --> 00:19:44.083
which is at the very heart of our
possibility of surviving on this planet,

00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:46.348
and let's zoom in on it.
Again, Hubble is there.

00:19:46.348 --> 00:19:48.262
Let's get into the butterfly's wings.

00:19:48.262 --> 00:19:52.465
Scholars have tried to explain:
Why is it blue?

00:19:52.465 --> 00:19:53.935
Let's zoom in on it.

00:19:53.935 --> 00:19:59.011
What you see is that the architecture
of the invisible humiliates

00:19:59.011 --> 00:20:02.043
the best architects in the world.

00:20:02.043 --> 00:20:04.440
All of this on a tiny scale.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.968
Besides its beauty and functioning,
there is another side to it.

00:20:07.968 --> 00:20:10.166
In nature,

00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:14.529
all that is organized in extraordinary
structures has a function.

00:20:14.529 --> 00:20:19.019
This function of the morpho butterfly â€”
it is not blue;

00:20:19.019 --> 00:20:20.673
it does not have blue pigments.

00:20:20.673 --> 00:20:24.717
It has photonic crystals on its surface,
according to people who studied it,

00:20:24.717 --> 00:20:26.968
which are extremely 
sophisticated crystals.

00:20:26.968 --> 00:20:30.427
Our technology had
nothing like that at the time.

00:20:30.427 --> 00:20:33.208
Hitachi has now made a monitor

00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:34.563
that uses this technology,

00:20:34.563 --> 00:20:36.940
and it is used in optical fibers
to transmit --

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.350
Janine Benyus, who's been here several
times, talks about it: biomimetics.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.702
My time's up.

00:20:42.702 --> 00:20:48.012
Then, I'll wrap it up with
what is at the base of this capacity,

00:20:48.012 --> 00:20:50.584
of this competence of biodiversity,

00:20:50.584 --> 00:20:53.006
producing all these wonderful services:

00:20:53.006 --> 00:20:54.913
the living cell.

00:20:54.913 --> 00:20:58.427
It is a structure with a few microns,
which is an internal wonder.

00:20:58.427 --> 00:21:01.454
There are TED Talks about it.
I won't talk much longer,

00:21:01.454 --> 00:21:04.628
but each person in this room,
including myself,

00:21:04.628 --> 00:21:08.319
has 100 trillion of these
micromachines in their body,

00:21:08.319 --> 00:21:11.159
so that we can enjoy well-being.

00:21:11.159 --> 00:21:13.916
Imagine what is out there
in the Amazon forest:

00:21:13.916 --> 00:21:17.927
100 trillion. This is greater
than the number of stars in the sky.

00:21:17.927 --> 00:21:19.985
And we are not aware of it.

00:21:19.985 --> 00:21:21.869
Thank you so much. (Applause)
