00:00:00.914 --> 00:00:02.241
Good afternoon.

00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:03.782
My name is Uldus.

00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:07.755
I am a photo-based artist from Russia.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:10.784
I started my way around six years ago

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:13.810
with ironic self-portraits

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.780
to lay open so many stereotypes

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.222
about nationalities, genders,

00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:21.662
and social issues —

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:24.665
["I am Russian. I sell drugs, guns, porno with kids!"]
["Vodka = water. I love vodka!"] (Laughter) —

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:29.233
using photography as my tool to send a message.
["Marry me, I need a visa."]

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:32.315
Today, I am still performing in front of the camera

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:36.162
and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman.

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:39.840
I focus on balancing meaningful message,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.860
aesthetic, beauty, composition, 
some irony, and artifacts.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.312
Today, I'm going to tell you about my project,

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:52.271
which is named Desperate Romantics.

00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:53.989
They're my artifacts, or paintings

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.817
from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England

00:00:58.817 --> 00:01:00.926
mid-19th century.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:02.940
I took the painting

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.182
and gifted new, contemporary meaning

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:10.037
talking about issues which are surrounding me

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:11.377
in Russia,

00:01:11.377 --> 00:01:14.698
capturing people who are non-models

00:01:14.698 --> 00:01:17.780
but have an interesting story.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.929
This boy is a professional dancer,

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:21.512
only 12 years old,

00:01:21.512 --> 00:01:25.440
but at secondary school, he hides his dancing classes

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.821
and is wearing the mask of brutality,

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:32.145
trying to be united with the rest of his classmates

00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:34.877
like a storm trooper has no personality.

00:01:34.877 --> 00:01:37.577
But this boy has goals and dreams

00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:40.570
but hides it to be socially accepted,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.218
because being different isn't easy,

00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:45.515
especially in Russia.

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:49.261
Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric.

00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:51.376
And this is Nikita,

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:54.740
a security guard from one of the bars

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.607
in St. Petersburg.

00:01:56.607 --> 00:02:00.207
He likes to say, "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry,"

00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:02.198
quoting Hulk from the movie,

00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:04.442
but I've never seen him angry.

00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:07.947
He hides his sensitivities and romantic side,

00:02:07.947 --> 00:02:09.938
because in Russia, among guys,

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:11.772
that's not cool to be romantic,

00:02:11.772 --> 00:02:14.520
but it's cool to be surrounded with women

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.823
and look like an aggressive hulk.

00:02:16.823 --> 00:02:19.100
(Laughter)

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.480
Sometimes, in my project,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.350
I would take the painting

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.205
and give it new meaning

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:29.040
and new temptation about it.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.572
Sometimes, I would compare facial features

00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:34.858
and playing with words:

00:02:34.858 --> 00:02:39.232
irony, Iron Man, ironing man.

00:02:39.232 --> 00:02:42.527
(Laughter)

00:02:42.527 --> 00:02:44.020
Through the artifacts,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.100
I bring social issues

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.806
which surround me in Russia into the conversation.

00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:52.809
Interesting fact about marriage in Russia,

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:56.285
that most of the 18, 19-year-old girls

00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:59.525
are already ready, and dream to get married.

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:01.100
We're taught from childhood,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.385
successful marriage means successful life,

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:06.949
so most of the girls kind of fight

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.534
to get a good husband.

00:03:09.534 --> 00:03:11.787
And what about me?

00:03:11.787 --> 00:03:13.822
I'm 27 years old.

00:03:13.822 --> 00:03:16.703
For Russian society, I'm an old maid

00:03:16.703 --> 00:03:19.526
and hopeless to ever get married.

00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:22.822
That's why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask,

00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:27.209
in the wedding dress, all desperate in my garden.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.930
But remember, irony is the key,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.283
and this is actually to motivate girls

00:03:32.283 --> 00:03:35.185
to fight for goals, for dreams,

00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:38.481
and change stereotypes.

00:03:38.481 --> 00:03:41.823
Be brave. Be ironic — it helps.

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:45.962
Be funny and create some magic.

00:03:45.962 --> 00:03:49.962
(Applause)
