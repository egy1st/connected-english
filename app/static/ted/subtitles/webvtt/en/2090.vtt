00:00:00.663 --> 00:00:03.066
Hans Rosling: I'm going to ask you

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.391
three multiple choice questions.

00:00:04.391 --> 00:00:08.122
Use this device. Use this device to answer.

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:10.677
The first question is, how did the number

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.798
of deaths per year

00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:14.090
from natural disaster,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.691
how did that change during the last century?

00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:18.070
Did it more than double,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.852
did it remain about the same in the world as a whole,

00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:23.226
or did it decrease to less than half?

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:25.630
Please answer A, B or C.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.730
I see lots of answers. This is much
faster than I do it at universities.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.887
They are so slow. They keep
thinking, thinking, thinking.

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:34.909
Oh, very, very good.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.772
And we go to the next question.

00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:39.431
So how long did women 30 years old

00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:41.527
in the world go to school:

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:43.561
seven years, five years or three years?

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:50.064
A, B or C? Please answer.

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:52.102
And we go to the next question.

00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:56.023
In the last 20 years, how did the percentage

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:57.850
of people in the world

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.067
who live in extreme poverty change?

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:02.628
Extreme poverty — not having 
enough food for the day.

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.689
Did it almost double,

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.238
did it remain more or less the same,

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:07.751
or did it halve?

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:11.771
A, B or C?

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.927
Now, answers.

00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:16.021
You see,

00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:17.746
deaths from natural disasters in the world,

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:19.668
you can see it from this graph here,

00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:22.448
from 1900 to 2000.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:25.703
In 1900, there was about half a million people

00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:27.790
who died every year from natural disasters:

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.887
floods, earthquakes, volcanic 
eruption, whatever, droughts.

00:01:32.887 --> 00:01:35.607
And then, how did that change?

00:01:35.607 --> 00:01:39.093
Gapminder asked the public in Sweden.

00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:40.952
This is how they answered.

00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:42.881
The Swedish public answered like this:

00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:44.353
Fifty percent thought it had doubled,

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:46.558
38 percent said it's more or less the same,

00:01:46.558 --> 00:01:48.656
12 said it had halved.

00:01:48.656 --> 00:01:51.308
This is the best data from the disaster researchers,

00:01:51.308 --> 00:01:54.274
and it goes up and down,

00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:56.826
and it goes to the Second World War,

00:01:56.826 --> 00:02:00.226
and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling

00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:02.072
and it's down to much less than half.

00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:04.680
The world has been much, much more capable

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.294
as the decades go by

00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:08.685
to protect people from this, you know.

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:11.551
So only 12 percent of the Swedes know this.

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:14.042
So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps.

00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:23.888
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:31.257
The chimps don't watch the evening news,

00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:32.715
so the chimps,

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:36.147
they choose by random, so the
Swedes answer worse than random.

00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:39.086
Now how did you do?

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:42.048
That's you.

00:02:42.048 --> 00:02:44.273
You were beaten by the chimps.

00:02:44.273 --> 00:02:46.063
(Laughter)

00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:49.038
But it was close.

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:53.059
You were three times better than the Swedes,

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.302
but that's not enough.

00:02:54.302 --> 00:02:56.884
You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes.

00:02:56.884 --> 00:03:00.415
You must have higher ambitions in the world.

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:03.823
Let's look at the next answer here: women in school.

00:03:03.823 --> 00:03:05.839
Here, you can see men went eight years.

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:07.620
How long did women go to school?

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.369
Well, we asked the Swedes like this,

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.586
and that gives you a hint, doesn't it?

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:14.948
The right answer is probably the one

00:03:14.948 --> 00:03:17.683
the fewest Swedes picked, isn't it?

00:03:17.683 --> 00:03:19.186
(Laughter)

00:03:19.186 --> 00:03:21.624
Let's see, let's see. Here we come.

00:03:21.624 --> 00:03:26.025
Yes, yes, yes, women have almost caught up.

00:03:26.025 --> 00:03:29.438
This is the U.S. public.

00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:33.313
And this is you. Here you come.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:37.325
Ooh.

00:03:37.325 --> 00:03:39.154
Well, congratulations, you're
twice as good as the Swedes,

00:03:39.154 --> 00:03:41.574
but you don't need me —

00:03:41.574 --> 00:03:46.388
So how come? I think it's like this,

00:03:46.388 --> 00:03:49.110
that everyone is aware that there are countries

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.214
and there are areas

00:03:50.214 --> 00:03:52.352
where girls have great difficulties.

00:03:52.352 --> 00:03:54.260
They are stopped when they go to school,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.325
and it's disgusting.

00:03:56.325 --> 00:03:58.222
But in the majority of the world,

00:03:58.222 --> 00:03:59.909
where most people in the world live,

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.891
most countries, girls today go to school

00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:05.430
as long as boys, more or less.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.489
That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved,

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.573
not at all.

00:04:09.573 --> 00:04:14.114
They still are confined to terrible, terrible limitations,

00:04:14.114 --> 00:04:16.346
but schooling is there in the world today.

00:04:16.346 --> 00:04:20.441
Now, we miss the majority.

00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:23.764
When you answer, you answer
according to the worst places,

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:26.620
and there you are right, but you miss the majority.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.096
What about poverty?

00:04:28.096 --> 00:04:30.999
Well, it's very clear that poverty here

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:32.774
was almost halved,

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:34.453
and in U.S., when we asked the public,

00:04:34.453 --> 00:04:38.437
only five percent got it right.

00:04:38.437 --> 00:04:41.306
And you?

00:04:41.306 --> 00:04:45.164
Ah, you almost made it to the chimps.

00:04:45.164 --> 00:04:47.525
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:53.142
That little, just a few of you!

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:56.821
There must be preconceived ideas, you know.

00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:58.615
And many in the rich countries,

00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:02.275
they think that oh, we can never end extreme poverty.

00:05:02.275 --> 00:05:03.928
Of course they think so,

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:06.892
because they don't even know what has happened.

00:05:06.892 --> 00:05:09.242
The first thing to think about the future

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.263
is to know about the present.

00:05:11.263 --> 00:05:14.315
These questions were a few of the first ones

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:17.700
in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.720
in Gapminder Foundation that we run,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.516
and it was started, this project, last year

00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:27.922
by my boss, and also my son, Ola Rosling. (Laughter)

00:05:27.922 --> 00:05:29.504
He's cofounder and director,

00:05:29.504 --> 00:05:31.048
and he wanted, Ola told me

00:05:31.048 --> 00:05:33.608
we have to be more systematic

00:05:33.608 --> 00:05:35.481
when we fight devastating ignorance.

00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:37.699
So already the pilots reveal this,

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.909
that so many in the public score worse than random,

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:42.992
so we have to think about preconceived ideas,

00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:45.020
and one of the main preconceived ideas

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.889
is about world income distribution.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.720
Look here. This is how it was in 1975.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.939
It's the number of people on each income,

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:56.830
from one dollar a day —

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.281
(Applause)

00:05:59.281 --> 00:06:01.356
See, there was one hump here,

00:06:01.356 --> 00:06:03.254
around one dollar a day,

00:06:03.254 --> 00:06:04.710
and then there was one hump here

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.725
somewhere between 10 and 100 dollars.

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:08.471
The world was two groups.

00:06:08.471 --> 00:06:12.081
It was a camel world, like a camel with two humps,

00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:14.093
the poor ones and the rich ones,

00:06:14.093 --> 00:06:15.657
and there were fewer in between.

00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:17.826
But look how this has changed:

00:06:17.826 --> 00:06:19.652
As I go forward, what has changed,

00:06:19.652 --> 00:06:21.308
the world population has grown,

00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:24.076
and the humps start to merge.

00:06:24.076 --> 00:06:26.846
The lower humps merged with the upper hump,

00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:29.973
and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.228
with one hump only.

00:06:32.228 --> 00:06:34.152
The percent in poverty has decreased.

00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:35.729
Still it's appalling

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.930
that so many remain in extreme poverty.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.953
We still have this group, almost a billion, over there,

00:06:41.953 --> 00:06:45.002
but that can be ended now.

00:06:45.002 --> 00:06:47.305
The challenge we have now

00:06:47.305 --> 00:06:50.113
is to get away from that,
understand where the majority is,

00:06:50.113 --> 00:06:53.357
and that is very clearly shown in this question.

00:06:53.357 --> 00:06:55.590
We asked, what is the percentage of the world's

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.244
one-year-old children who have got those

00:06:57.244 --> 00:06:59.854
basic vaccines against measles and other things

00:06:59.854 --> 00:07:01.347
that we have had for many years:

00:07:01.347 --> 00:07:03.369
20, 50 or 80 percent?

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:07.442
Now, this is what the U.S.
public and the Swedish answered.

00:07:07.442 --> 00:07:08.318
Look at the Swedish result:

00:07:08.318 --> 00:07:10.380
you know what the right answer is.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.053
(Laughter)

00:07:14.053 --> 00:07:17.556
Who the heck is a professor of
global health in that country?

00:07:17.556 --> 00:07:19.228
Well, it's me. It's me.

00:07:19.228 --> 00:07:21.190
(Laughter)

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.672
It's very difficult, this. It's very difficult.

00:07:23.672 --> 00:07:26.770
(Applause)

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.484
However, Ola's approach

00:07:30.484 --> 00:07:33.642
to really measure what we know made headlines,

00:07:33.642 --> 00:07:36.705
and CNN published these results on their web

00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:38.852
and they had the questions there, millions answered,

00:07:38.852 --> 00:07:42.334
and I think there were about 2,000 comments,

00:07:42.334 --> 00:07:44.647
and this was one of the comments.

00:07:44.647 --> 00:07:48.191
"I bet no member of the media
passed the test," he said.

00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:50.830
So Ola told me, "Take these devices.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.535
You are invited to media conferences.

00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:54.812
Give it to them and measure what the media know."

00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:56.736
And ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:56.736 --> 00:07:59.413
for the first time, the informal results

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:03.338
from a conference with U.S. media.

00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:08.224
And then, lately, from the European Union media.

00:08:08.224 --> 00:08:09.492
(Laughter)

00:08:09.492 --> 00:08:11.697
You see, the problem is not that people

00:08:11.697 --> 00:08:13.645
don't read and listen to the media.

00:08:13.645 --> 00:08:17.864
The problem is that the
media doesn't know themselves.

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:19.445
What shall we do about this, Ola?

00:08:19.445 --> 00:08:20.943
Do we have any ideas?

00:08:20.943 --> 00:08:32.037
(Applause)

00:08:32.037 --> 00:08:35.746
Ola Rosling: Yes, I have an idea, but first,

00:08:35.746 --> 00:08:39.561
I'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.194
Fortunately, I will be able to comfort you

00:08:42.194 --> 00:08:46.753
by showing why it was not your fault, actually.

00:08:46.753 --> 00:08:48.775
Then, I will equip you with some tricks

00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:50.865
for beating the chimps in the future.

00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:53.079
That's basically what I will do.

00:08:53.079 --> 00:08:55.282
But first, let's look at why are we so ignorant,

00:08:55.282 --> 00:08:57.889
and it all starts in this place.

00:08:57.889 --> 00:09:01.579
It's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden.

00:09:01.579 --> 00:09:05.376
It's a neighborhood where I grew up,

00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:08.977
and it's a neighborhood with a large problem.

00:09:08.977 --> 00:09:10.963
Actually, it has exactly the same problem

00:09:10.963 --> 00:09:13.572
which existed in all the neighborhoods

00:09:13.572 --> 00:09:14.920
where you grew up as well.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.582
It was not representative. Okay?

00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:20.025
It gave me a very biased view

00:09:20.025 --> 00:09:22.373
of how life is on this planet.

00:09:22.373 --> 00:09:25.365
So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle.

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:26.637
We have a personal bias.

00:09:26.637 --> 00:09:28.750
We have all different experiences

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.390
from communities and people we meet,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.377
and on top of this, we start school,

00:09:33.377 --> 00:09:35.298
and we add the next problem.

00:09:35.298 --> 00:09:36.442
Well, I like schools,

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:41.529
but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews,

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:44.130
because they learned something
when they went to school,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.683
and now they describe this world to the students

00:09:46.683 --> 00:09:48.889
without any bad intentions,

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:51.118
and those books, of course, that are printed

00:09:51.118 --> 00:09:54.049
are outdated in a world that changes.

00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:55.296
And there is really no practice

00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:58.545
to keep the teaching material up to date.

00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:00.529
So that's what we are focusing on.

00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:02.098
So we have these outdated facts

00:10:02.098 --> 00:10:05.032
added on top of our personal bias.

00:10:05.032 --> 00:10:07.508
What happens next is news, okay?

00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:10.025
An excellent journalist knows how to pick

00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:12.431
the story that will make headlines,

00:10:12.431 --> 00:10:15.030
and people will read it because it's sensational.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.995
Unusual events are more interesting, no?

00:10:18.995 --> 00:10:20.710
And they are exaggerated,

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.139
and especially things we're afraid of.

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:26.567
A shark attack on a Swedish person

00:10:26.567 --> 00:10:30.282
will get headlines for weeks in Sweden.

00:10:30.282 --> 00:10:34.001
So these three skewed sources of information

00:10:34.001 --> 00:10:37.276
were really hard to get away from.

00:10:37.276 --> 00:10:38.907
They kind of bombard us

00:10:38.907 --> 00:10:42.713
and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas,

00:10:42.713 --> 00:10:45.450
and on top of it we put the very thing

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:50.716
that makes us humans, our human intuition.

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:52.892
It was good in evolution.

00:10:52.892 --> 00:10:54.150
It helped us generalize

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.408
and jump to conclusions very, very fast.

00:10:56.408 --> 00:11:00.376
It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of,

00:11:00.376 --> 00:11:03.660
and we seek causality where there is none,

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.597
and we then get an illusion of confidence

00:11:08.597 --> 00:11:11.603
where we believe that we are the best car drivers,

00:11:11.603 --> 00:11:13.343
above the average.

00:11:13.343 --> 00:11:14.705
Everybody answered that question,

00:11:14.705 --> 00:11:15.974
"Yeah, I drive cars better."

00:11:15.974 --> 00:11:18.271
Okay, this was good evolutionarily,

00:11:18.271 --> 00:11:20.104
but now when it comes to the worldview,

00:11:20.104 --> 00:11:22.966
it is the exact reason why it's upside down.

00:11:22.966 --> 00:11:25.889
The trends that are increasing are instead falling,

00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:27.471
and the other way around,

00:11:27.471 --> 00:11:31.471
and in this case, the chimps
use our intuition against us,

00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:34.911
and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength.

00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:37.394
It was supposed to be our strength, wasn't it?

00:11:37.394 --> 00:11:39.766
So how do we solve such problems?

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.441
First, we need to measure it,

00:11:41.441 --> 00:11:42.843
and then we need to cure it.

00:11:42.843 --> 00:11:45.375
So by measuring it we can understand

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:47.699
what is the pattern of ignorance.

00:11:47.699 --> 00:11:49.235
We started the pilot last year,

00:11:49.235 --> 00:11:51.704
and now we're pretty sure that we will encounter

00:11:51.704 --> 00:11:55.285
a lot of ignorance across the whole world,

00:11:55.285 --> 00:11:58.898
and the idea is really to

00:11:58.898 --> 00:12:00.875
scale it up to all domains

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:03.423
or dimensions of global development,

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:07.505
such as climate, endangered species, human rights,

00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:10.715
gender equality, energy, finance.

00:12:10.715 --> 00:12:13.448
All different sectors have facts,

00:12:13.448 --> 00:12:15.044
and there are organizations trying to spread

00:12:15.044 --> 00:12:16.970
awareness about these facts.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.674
So I've started actually contacting some of them,

00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:24.015
like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF,

00:12:24.015 --> 00:12:26.613
and asking them, what are your favorite facts

00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:28.506
which you think the public doesn't know?

00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:30.084
Okay, I gather those facts.

00:12:30.084 --> 00:12:33.619
Imagine a long list with, say, 250 facts.

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:34.918
And then we poll the public

00:12:34.918 --> 00:12:36.855
and see where they score worst.

00:12:36.855 --> 00:12:38.201
So we get a shorter list

00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:39.257
with the terrible results,

00:12:39.257 --> 00:12:41.806
like some few examples from Hans,

00:12:41.806 --> 00:12:43.723
and we have no problem finding these kinds

00:12:43.723 --> 00:12:44.938
of terrible results.

00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:47.783
Okay, this little shortlist, what
are we going to do with it?

00:12:47.783 --> 00:12:51.909
Well, we turn it into a knowledge certificate,

00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:53.771
a global knowledge certificate,

00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:56.674
which you can use, if you're a large organization,

00:12:56.674 --> 00:13:00.429
a school, a university, or maybe a news agency,

00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:04.057
to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable.

00:13:04.057 --> 00:13:07.020
Basically meaning, we don't hire people

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.290
who score like chimpanzees.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.650
Of course you shouldn't.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.921
So maybe 10 years from now,

00:13:13.921 --> 00:13:15.913
if this project succeeds,

00:13:15.913 --> 00:13:18.161
you will be sitting in an interview

00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:22.367
having to fill out this crazy global knowledge.

00:13:22.367 --> 00:13:25.730
So now we come to the practical tricks.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.634
How are you going to succeed?

00:13:27.634 --> 00:13:31.213
There is, of course, one way,

00:13:31.213 --> 00:13:32.950
which is to sit down late nights

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.105
and learn all the facts by heart

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:36.873
by reading all these reports.

00:13:36.873 --> 00:13:38.885
That will never happen, actually.

00:13:38.885 --> 00:13:41.594
Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen.

00:13:41.594 --> 00:13:42.967
People don't have that time.

00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:46.350
People like shortcuts, and here are the shortcuts.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.124
We need to turn our intuition into strength again.

00:13:49.124 --> 00:13:50.568
We need to be able to generalize.

00:13:50.568 --> 00:13:52.673
So now I'm going to show you some tricks

00:13:52.673 --> 00:13:55.223
where the misconceptions are turned around

00:13:55.223 --> 00:13:58.431
into rules of thumb.

00:13:58.431 --> 00:14:00.445
Let's start with the first misconception.

00:14:00.445 --> 00:14:02.082
This is very widespread.

00:14:02.082 --> 00:14:03.948
Everything is getting worse.

00:14:03.948 --> 00:14:07.218
You heard it. You thought it yourself.

00:14:07.218 --> 00:14:10.247
The other way to think is, most things improve.

00:14:10.247 --> 00:14:12.383
So you're sitting with a question in front of you

00:14:12.383 --> 00:14:15.616
and you're unsure. You should guess "improve."

00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:18.600
Okay? Don't go for the worse.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.963
That will help you score better on our tests.

00:14:20.963 --> 00:14:22.179
(Applause)

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:26.405
That was the first one.

00:14:26.405 --> 00:14:28.164
There are rich and poor

00:14:28.164 --> 00:14:29.630
and the gap is increasing.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.285
It's a terrible inequality.

00:14:31.285 --> 00:14:33.486
Yeah, it's an unequal world,

00:14:33.486 --> 00:14:35.811
but when you look at the data, it's one hump.

00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:37.665
Okay? If you feel unsure,

00:14:37.665 --> 00:14:40.418
go for "the most people are in the middle."

00:14:40.418 --> 00:14:42.401
That's going to help you get the answer right.

00:14:42.401 --> 00:14:46.108
Now, the next preconceived idea is

00:14:46.108 --> 00:14:49.733
first countries and people need to be very, very rich

00:14:49.733 --> 00:14:52.059
to get the social development

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:55.510
like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.196
No, no, no. That's wrong.

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:59.316
Look: that huge hump in the middle

00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:01.759
already have girls in school.

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:04.087
So if you are unsure, go for the

00:15:04.087 --> 00:15:05.482
"the majority already have this,"

00:15:05.482 --> 00:15:08.525
like electricity and girls in
school, these kinds of things.

00:15:08.525 --> 00:15:10.741
They're only rules of thumb,

00:15:10.741 --> 00:15:13.131
so of course they don't apply to everything,

00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:14.788
but this is how you can generalize.

00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:16.753
Let's look at the last one.

00:15:16.753 --> 00:15:20.054
If something, yes, this is a good one,

00:15:20.054 --> 00:15:22.227
sharks are dangerous.

00:15:22.227 --> 00:15:26.626
No — well, yes, but they are not so important

00:15:26.626 --> 00:15:29.602
in the global statistics, that is what I'm saying.

00:15:29.602 --> 00:15:32.133
I actually, I'm very afraid of sharks.

00:15:32.133 --> 00:15:34.977
So as soon as I see a question
about things I'm afraid of,

00:15:34.977 --> 00:15:37.910
which might be earthquakes, other religions,

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.948
maybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks,

00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:42.107
anything that makes me feel,

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:44.608
assume you're going to exaggerate the problem.

00:15:44.608 --> 00:15:46.445
That's a rule of thumb.

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:48.604
Of course there are dangerous 
things that are also great.

00:15:48.604 --> 00:15:52.189
Sharks kill very, very few.
That's how you should think.

00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:55.927
With these four rules of thumb,

00:15:55.927 --> 00:15:59.287
you could probably answer better than the chimps,

00:15:59.287 --> 00:16:01.241
because the chimps cannot do this.

00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:03.844
They cannot generalize these kinds of rules.

00:16:03.844 --> 00:16:07.856
And hopefully we can turn your world around

00:16:07.856 --> 00:16:10.691
and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay?

00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:14.612
(Applause)

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.248
That's a systematic approach.

00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:23.812
Now the question, is this important?

00:16:23.812 --> 00:16:26.538
Yeah, it's important to understand poverty,

00:16:26.538 --> 00:16:29.785
extreme poverty and how to fight it,

00:16:29.785 --> 00:16:31.830
and how to bring girls in school.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.170
When we realize that actually it's
succeeding, we can understand it.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.982
But is it important for everyone else

00:16:37.982 --> 00:16:40.436
who cares about the rich end of this scale?

00:16:40.436 --> 00:16:42.480
I would say yes, extremely important,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.989
for the same reason.

00:16:43.989 --> 00:16:47.054
If you have a fact-based worldview of today,

00:16:47.054 --> 00:16:48.672
you might have a chance to understand

00:16:48.672 --> 00:16:50.426
what's coming next in the future.

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:52.864
We're going back to these two humps in 1975.

00:16:52.864 --> 00:16:54.214
That's when I was born,

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:57.233
and I selected the West.

00:16:57.233 --> 00:17:01.416
That's the current EU countries and North America.

00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:04.799
Let's now see how the rest and the West compares

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:06.880
in terms of how rich you are.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.131
These are the people who can afford

00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:12.709
to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation.

00:17:12.709 --> 00:17:16.017
In 1975, only 30 percent of them lived

00:17:16.017 --> 00:17:18.984
outside EU and North America.

00:17:18.984 --> 00:17:21.313
But this has changed, okay?

00:17:21.313 --> 00:17:26.056
So first, let's look at the change up till today, 2014.

00:17:26.056 --> 00:17:27.444
Today it's 50/50.

00:17:27.444 --> 00:17:31.125
The Western domination is over, as of today.

00:17:31.125 --> 00:17:33.324
That's nice. So what's going to happen next?

00:17:33.324 --> 00:17:36.567
Do you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved?

00:17:36.567 --> 00:17:42.598
I did a little experiment. I went to the IMF,
International Monetary Fund, website.

00:17:42.598 --> 00:17:46.761
They have a forecast for the next 
five years of GDP per capita.

00:17:46.761 --> 00:17:49.778
So I can use that to go five years into the future,

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:53.113
assuming the income inequality 
of each country is the same.

00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:55.040
I did that, but I went even further.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.218
I used those five years for the next 20 years

00:17:58.218 --> 00:18:03.495
with the same speed, just as an 
experiment what might actually happen.

00:18:03.495 --> 00:18:04.862
Let's move into the future.

00:18:04.862 --> 00:18:10.082
In 2020, it's 57 percent in the rest.

00:18:10.082 --> 00:18:13.118
In 2025, 63 percent.

00:18:13.118 --> 00:18:22.355
2030, 68. And in 2035, the West is 
outnumbered in the rich consumer market.

00:18:22.355 --> 00:18:25.702
These are just projections of 
GDP per capita into the future.

00:18:25.702 --> 00:18:28.057
Seventy-three percent of the rich consumers

00:18:28.057 --> 00:18:31.675
are going to live outside North America and Europe.

00:18:31.675 --> 00:18:35.873
So yes, I think it's a good idea for 
a company to use this certificate

00:18:35.873 --> 00:18:39.280
to make sure to make fact-
based decisions in the future.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.756
Thank you very much.

00:18:40.756 --> 00:18:43.257
(Applause)

00:18:48.184 --> 00:18:50.236
