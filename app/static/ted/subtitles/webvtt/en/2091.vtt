00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.531
Hi everybody. So my name is Mac.

00:00:02.531 --> 00:00:06.589
My job is that I lie to children,

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.605
but they're honest lies.

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:10.373
I write children's books,

00:00:10.373 --> 00:00:13.601
and there's a quote from Pablo Picasso,

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:16.787
"We all know that Art is not truth.

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:20.429
Art is a lie that makes us realize truth

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.127
or at least the truth that is 
given us to understand.

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:25.237
The artist must know the manner whereby

00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:30.074
to convince others of the 
truthfulness of his lies."

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:32.932
I first heard this when I was a kid,

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.623
and I loved it,

00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:37.415
but I had no idea what it meant.

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:38.992
(Laughter)

00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:40.889
So I thought, you know what, it's what I'm here

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:42.508
to talk to you today about, though,

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:44.721
truth and lies, fiction and reality.

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:46.573
So how could I untangle

00:00:46.573 --> 00:00:49.100
this knotted bunch of sentences?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.527
And I said, I've got PowerPoint.
Let's do a Venn diagram.

00:00:52.527 --> 00:00:55.020
["Truth. Lies."]
(Laughter)

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.780
So there it is, right there, boom.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.485
We've got truth and lies

00:00:58.485 --> 00:00:59.557
and then there's this little space,

00:00:59.557 --> 00:01:01.118
the edge, in the middle.

00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:07.918
That liminal space, that's art.

00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:12.915
All right. Venn diagram. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:15.941
But that's actually not very helpful either.

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:20.316
The thing that made me understand

00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:22.806
that quote and really kind of what art,

00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:25.023
at least the art of fiction, was,

00:01:25.023 --> 00:01:26.463
was working with kids.

00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:28.723
I used to be a summer camp counselor.

00:01:28.723 --> 00:01:31.010
I would do it on my summers off from college,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.389
and I loved it.

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:36.148
It was a sports summer camp

00:01:36.148 --> 00:01:37.982
for four- to six-year-olds.

00:01:37.982 --> 00:01:39.628
I was in charge of the four-year-olds,

00:01:39.628 --> 00:01:41.431
which is good, because

00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:44.780
four-year-olds can't play 
sports, and neither can I.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.355
(Laughter)

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:49.280
I play sports at a four-year-old level,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.997
so what would happen is the kids would

00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:54.696
dribble around some cones, and then got hot,

00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:56.959
and then they would go sit underneath the tree

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.804
where I was already sitting — (Laughter) —

00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:02.349
and I would just make up stories and tell them to them

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.168
and I would tell them stories about my life.

00:02:04.168 --> 00:02:05.911
I would tell them about how, on the weekends,

00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:09.126
I would go home and I would
spy for the Queen of England.

00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:12.447
And soon, other kids

00:02:12.447 --> 00:02:14.287
who weren't even in my group of kids,

00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:15.756
they would come up to me, and they would say,

00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:17.668
"You're Mac Barnett, right?

00:02:17.668 --> 00:02:20.737
You're the guy who spies for the Queen of England."

00:02:20.737 --> 00:02:23.959
And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.389
to come up and ask me that question.

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.662
In my fantasy, they were svelte Russian women,

00:02:28.662 --> 00:02:29.899
but, you know, four-year-olds —

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:34.528
you take what you can get in Berkeley, California.

00:02:34.528 --> 00:02:38.956
And I realized that the stories that I was telling

00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:42.453
were real in this way that was familiar to me

00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:43.658
and really exciting.

00:02:43.658 --> 00:02:45.864
I think the pinnacle of this for 
me — I'll never forget this —

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.687
there was this little girl 
named Riley. She was tiny,

00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:51.126
and she used to always take 
out her lunch every day

00:02:51.126 --> 00:02:53.466
and she would throw out her fruit.

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:54.874
She would just take her fruit,

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.222
her mom packed her a melon every day,

00:02:56.222 --> 00:02:57.971
and she would just throw it in the ivy

00:02:57.971 --> 00:03:00.284
and then she would eat fruit snacks

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:02.657
and pudding cups, and I was like, "Riley,

00:03:02.657 --> 00:03:05.713
you can't do that, you 
have to eat the fruit."

00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:07.530
And she was like, "Why?"

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.362
And I was like, "Well, when
you throw the fruit in the ivy,

00:03:09.362 --> 00:03:13.254
pretty soon, it's going to be overgrown with melons,"

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:15.256
which is why I think I ended up

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:20.875
telling stories to children and not
being a nutritionist for children.

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:22.763
And so Riley was like, "That will never happen.

00:03:22.763 --> 00:03:23.863
That's not going to happen."

00:03:23.863 --> 00:03:26.914
And so, on the last day of camp,

00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:29.367
I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:31.393
from the grocery store

00:03:31.393 --> 00:03:33.495
and I hid it in the ivy,

00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:34.946
and then at lunchtime, I was like,

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:37.621
"Riley, why don't you go over
there and see what you've done."

00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:40.796
And — (Laughter) —

00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:43.474
she went trudging through 
the ivy, and then her eyes

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:45.566
just got so wide, and she pointed out this melon

00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:47.680
that was bigger than her head,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.650
and then all the kids ran over 
there and rushed around her,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.237
and one of the kids was like, "Hey,

00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:54.126
why is there a sticker on this?"

00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:57.350
(Laughter)

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.819
And I was like, "That is also why I say

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.811
do not throw your stickers in the ivy.

00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:08.283
Put them in the trash can. It
ruins nature when you do this."

00:04:08.283 --> 00:04:13.633
And Riley carried that melon around with her all day,

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:15.661
and she was so proud.

00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:20.505
And Riley knew she didn't 
grow a melon in seven days,

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:23.441
but she also knew that she did,

00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:25.657
and it's a weird place,

00:04:25.657 --> 00:04:28.402
but it's not just a place that kids can get to.

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:31.934
It's anything. Art can get us to that place.

00:04:31.934 --> 00:04:33.891
She was right in that place in the middle,

00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:37.316
that place which you could call art or fiction.

00:04:37.316 --> 00:04:39.381
I'm going to call it wonder.

00:04:39.381 --> 00:04:42.010
It's what Coleridge called the
willing suspension of disbelief

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.690
or poetic faith,

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.100
for those moments where a
story, no matter how strange,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.140
has some semblance of the truth,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.117
and then you're able to believe it.

00:04:50.117 --> 00:04:51.747
It's not just kids who can get there.

00:04:51.747 --> 00:04:54.436
Adults can too, and we get there when we read.

00:04:54.436 --> 00:04:56.686
It's why in two days, people will be

00:04:56.686 --> 00:05:00.220
descending on Dublin to take the walking tour

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.825
of Bloomsday and see everything
that happened in "Ulysses,"

00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:08.080
even though none of that happened.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.337
Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:11.809
to see Sherlock Holmes' apartment,

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:13.936
even though 221B is just a number that was painted

00:05:13.936 --> 00:05:17.082
on a building that never 
actually had that address.

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:18.807
We know these characters aren't real,

00:05:18.807 --> 00:05:21.427
but we have real feelings about them,

00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:22.471
and we're able to do that.

00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:24.364
We know these characters aren't real,

00:05:24.364 --> 00:05:27.682
and yet we also know that they are.

00:05:27.682 --> 00:05:31.338
Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can,

00:05:31.338 --> 00:05:32.891
and that's why I love writing for kids.

00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:34.871
I think kids are the best audience

00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:39.260
for serious literary fiction.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.084
When I was a kid,

00:05:42.084 --> 00:05:44.710
I was obsessed with secret door novels,

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.871
things like "Narnia,"

00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:49.574
where you would open a wardrobe
and go through to a magical land.

00:05:49.574 --> 00:05:52.304
And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist

00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:54.332
and I would look for them and try to go through them.

00:05:54.332 --> 00:05:58.076
I wanted to live and cross over into 
that fictional world, which is —

00:05:58.076 --> 00:06:03.771
I would always just open people's closet doors. 
(Laughter)

00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:06.548
I would just go through my mom's boyfriend's closet,

00:06:06.548 --> 00:06:08.798
and there was not a secret magical land there.

00:06:08.798 --> 00:06:11.386
There was some other weird stuff that
I think my mom should know about.

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:13.107
(Laughter)

00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:17.272
And I was happy to tell her all about it.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:23.683
After college, my first job was working

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:26.231
behind one of these secret doors.

00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:28.188
This is a place called 826 Valencia.

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:30.280
It's at 826 Valencia Street

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.766
in the Mission in San Francisco,

00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:34.792
and when I worked there, there
was a publishing company

00:06:34.792 --> 00:06:37.431
headquartered there called McSweeney's,

00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:40.585
a nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia,

00:06:40.585 --> 00:06:42.790
but then the front of it

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.360
was a strange shop.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.787
You see, this place was zoned retail,

00:06:45.787 --> 00:06:48.903
and in San Francisco, they were
not going to give us a variance,

00:06:48.903 --> 00:06:51.790
and so the writer who founded
it, a writer named Dave Eggers,

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.129
to come into compliance 
with code, he said, "Fine,

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:58.505
I'm just going to build a pirate supply store."

00:06:58.505 --> 00:07:01.583
And that's what he did. (Laughter)

00:07:01.583 --> 00:07:03.534
And it's beautiful. It's all wood.

00:07:03.534 --> 00:07:05.464
There's drawers you can pull out and get citrus

00:07:05.464 --> 00:07:08.483
so you don't get scurvy.

00:07:08.483 --> 00:07:10.631
They have eyepatches in lots of colors,

00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:13.331
because when it's springtime, pirates want to go wild.

00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:17.674
You don't know. Black is boring. Pastel.

00:07:17.674 --> 00:07:19.670
Or eyes, also in lots of colors,

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.475
just glass eyes, depending on how you want

00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:25.187
to deal with that situation.

00:07:25.187 --> 00:07:28.312
And the store, strangely,

00:07:28.312 --> 00:07:32.324
people came to them and bought things,

00:07:32.324 --> 00:07:34.151
and they ended up paying the rent

00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:36.215
for our tutoring center, which was behind it,

00:07:36.215 --> 00:07:39.267
but to me, more important was the fact

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:41.918
that I think the quality of work you do,

00:07:41.918 --> 00:07:44.404
kids would come and get instruction in writing,

00:07:44.404 --> 00:07:48.670
and when you have to walk this weird, liminal,
fictional space like this to go do your writing,

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.420
it's going to affect the kind of work that you make.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.607
It's a secret door that you can walk through.

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:57.358
So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles,

00:07:57.358 --> 00:08:00.840
and it was my job to build the store down there.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.400
So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.240
That's our motto: "Whenever
you are, we're already then."

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.100
(Laughter)

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.857
And it's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.

00:08:15.857 --> 00:08:17.967
Our friendly staff is ready to help you.

00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:20.110
They're from all eras,

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.719
including just the 1980s, that guy on the end,

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:25.916
he's from the very recent past.

00:08:25.916 --> 00:08:27.618
There's our Employees of the Month,

00:08:27.618 --> 00:08:30.604
including Genghis Khan, Charles Dickens.

00:08:30.604 --> 00:08:33.596
Some great people have come up through our ranks.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.947
This is our kind of pharmacy section.

00:08:35.947 --> 00:08:37.286
We have some patent medicines,

00:08:37.286 --> 00:08:39.637
Canopic jars for your organs,

00:08:39.637 --> 00:08:41.271
communist soap that says,

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:45.722
"This is your soap for the year."
(Laughter)

00:08:45.722 --> 00:08:47.938
Our slushy machine broke

00:08:47.938 --> 00:08:50.571
on the opening night and 
we didn't know what to do.

00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:52.810
Our architect was covered in red syrup.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.284
It looked like he had just murdered somebody,

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:56.971
which it was not out of the question

00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:59.021
for this particular architect,

00:08:59.021 --> 00:09:00.607
and we didn't know what to do.

00:09:00.607 --> 00:09:01.639
It was going to be the highlight of our store.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:02.984
So we just put that sign on it that said,

00:09:02.984 --> 00:09:07.489
"Out of order. Come back yesterday."
(Laughter)

00:09:07.489 --> 00:09:09.525
And that ended up being a better joke than slushies,

00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:13.621
so we just left it there forever.

00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:17.934
Mammoth Chunks. These things
weigh, like, seven pounds each.

00:09:17.934 --> 00:09:20.134
Barbarian repellent. It's full of salad

00:09:20.134 --> 00:09:24.712
and potpourri — things that barbarians hate.

00:09:24.712 --> 00:09:26.670
Dead languages.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.370
(Laughter)

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.450
Leeches, nature's tiny doctors.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.590
And Viking Odorant, which
comes in lots of great scents:

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.595
toenails, sweat and rotten vegetables, pyre ash.

00:09:39.595 --> 00:09:41.703
Because we believe that Axe Body Spray

00:09:41.703 --> 00:09:43.366
is something that you should
only find on the battlefield,

00:09:43.366 --> 00:09:47.560
not under your arms.
(Laughter)

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.544
And these are robot emotion chips,

00:09:49.544 --> 00:09:51.771
so robots can feel love or fear.

00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:53.481
Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude,

00:09:53.481 --> 00:09:54.782
which we did not expect.

00:09:54.782 --> 00:09:55.793
(Laughter)

00:09:55.793 --> 00:09:58.240
We did not think that was going to happen.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.501
But there's a nonprofit behind it,

00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:02.481
and kids go through a door
that says "Employees Only"

00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:03.696
and they end up in this space

00:10:03.696 --> 00:10:05.870
where they do homework and write stories

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.330
and make films and this is a book release party

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.814
where kids will read.

00:10:09.814 --> 00:10:11.716
There's a quarterly that's published

00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:13.145
with just writing that's done by the kids

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:14.202
who come every day after school,

00:10:14.202 --> 00:10:15.730
and we have release parties

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.677
and they eat cake and read for their parents

00:10:18.677 --> 00:10:21.529
and drink milk out of champagne glasses.

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:24.777
And it's a very special space,

00:10:24.777 --> 00:10:27.996
because it's this weird space in the front.

00:10:27.996 --> 00:10:31.295
The joke isn't a joke.

00:10:31.295 --> 00:10:33.695
You can't find the seams on the fiction,

00:10:33.695 --> 00:10:36.603
and I love that. It's this little bit of fiction

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:39.865
that's colonized the real world.

00:10:39.865 --> 00:10:43.922
I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions.

00:10:43.922 --> 00:10:46.162
There's a term called metafiction,

00:10:46.162 --> 00:10:50.245
and that's just stories about stories,

00:10:50.245 --> 00:10:51.820
and meta's having a moment now.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.845
Its last big moment was probably in the 1960s

00:10:53.845 --> 00:10:56.522
with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis,

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:57.770
but it's been around.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.311
It's almost as old as storytelling itself.

00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:03.851
And one metafictive technique

00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:05.645
is breaking the fourth wall. Right?

00:11:05.645 --> 00:11:08.895
It's when an actor will turn to the audience

00:11:08.895 --> 00:11:09.961
and say, "I am an actor,

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.552
these are just rafters."

00:11:12.552 --> 00:11:14.577
And even that supposedly honest moment,

00:11:14.577 --> 00:11:16.803
I would argue, is in service of the lie,

00:11:16.803 --> 00:11:19.559
but it's supposed to foreground the artificiality

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:21.246
of the fiction.

00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:23.395
For me, I kind of prefer the opposite.

00:11:23.395 --> 00:11:25.529
If I'm going to break down the fourth wall,

00:11:25.529 --> 00:11:27.872
I want fiction to escape

00:11:27.872 --> 00:11:29.955
and come into the real world.

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:34.554
I want a book to be a secret door that opens

00:11:34.554 --> 00:11:37.446
and lets the stories out into reality.

00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:40.427
And so I try to do this in my books.

00:11:40.427 --> 00:11:41.970
And here's just one example.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.892
This is the first book that I ever made.

00:11:43.892 --> 00:11:46.513
It's called "Billy Twitters
and his Blue Whale Problem."

00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:48.643
And it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet

00:11:48.643 --> 00:11:50.229
but it's a punishment

00:11:50.229 --> 00:11:52.704
and it ruins his life.

00:11:52.704 --> 00:11:55.516
So it's delivered overnight by FedUp.

00:11:55.516 --> 00:11:58.106
(Laughter)

00:11:58.106 --> 00:12:00.100
And he has to take it to school with him.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.454
He lives in San Francisco —

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:03.985
very tough city to own a blue whale in.

00:12:03.985 --> 00:12:08.419
A lot of hills, real estate is at a premium.

00:12:08.419 --> 00:12:10.927
This market's crazy, everybody.

00:12:10.927 --> 00:12:14.718
But underneath the jacket is this case,

00:12:14.718 --> 00:12:18.904
and that's the cover underneath the book, the jacket,

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.284
and there's an ad

00:12:20.284 --> 00:12:23.527
that offers a free 30-day risk-free trial

00:12:23.527 --> 00:12:25.426
for a blue whale.

00:12:25.426 --> 00:12:28.420
And you can just send in a
self-addressed stamped envelope

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.270
and we'll send you a whale.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.610
And kids do write in.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.018
So here's a letter. It says, "Dear people,

00:12:40.018 --> 00:12:43.199
I bet you 10 bucks you won't send me a blue whale.

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:45.676
Eliot Gannon (age 6)."

00:12:45.676 --> 00:12:49.350
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:52.960
So what Eliot and the other kids

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.451
who send these in get back

00:12:55.451 --> 00:12:58.376
is a letter in very small print
from a Norwegian law firm —

00:12:58.376 --> 00:13:02.337
(Laughter) —

00:13:02.337 --> 00:13:05.698
that says that due to a change in customs laws,

00:13:05.698 --> 00:13:07.905
their whale has been held up in Sognefjord,

00:13:07.905 --> 00:13:09.129
which is a very lovely fjord,

00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:10.593
and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord

00:13:10.593 --> 00:13:13.073
and Norwegian food for 
a little while. It digresses.

00:13:13.073 --> 00:13:14.855
(Laughter)

00:13:16.767 --> 00:13:18.680
But it finishes off by saying that

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.414
your whale would love to hear from you.

00:13:21.414 --> 00:13:23.000
He's got a phone number,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.714
and you can call and leave him a message.

00:13:27.714 --> 00:13:30.290
And when you call and leave him a message,

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.281
you just, on the outgoing message,

00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:37.399
it's just whale sounds and then a beep,

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:40.954
which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound.

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:42.934
And they get a picture of their whale too.

00:13:42.934 --> 00:13:45.465
So this is Randolph,

00:13:45.465 --> 00:13:48.806
and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico

00:13:48.806 --> 00:13:53.088
who was one of the first kids to ever call in,

00:13:53.088 --> 00:13:55.398
and I'll play you some of Nico's message.

00:13:55.398 --> 00:13:59.530
This is the first message I ever got from Nico.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.769
(Audio) Nico: Hello, this is Nico.

00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:05.803
I am your owner, Randolph. Hello.

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:09.279
So this is the first time I can ever talk to you,

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:15.523
and I might talk to you soon another day. Bye.

00:14:15.523 --> 00:14:18.110
Mac Barnett: So Nico called back, like, an hour later.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.360
(Laughter)

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.297
And here's another one of Nico's messages.

00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:27.840
(Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph, this is Nico.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.993
I haven't talked to you for a long time,

00:14:32.993 --> 00:14:37.688
but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday,

00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:39.938
yeah, Saturday or Sunday,

00:14:39.938 --> 00:14:42.953
so now I'm calling you again

00:14:42.953 --> 00:14:47.869
to say hello and I wonder what you're doing right now,

00:14:47.869 --> 00:14:50.805
and I'm going to probably call you again

00:14:50.805 --> 00:14:52.988
tomorrow or today,

00:14:52.988 --> 00:14:57.184
so I'll talk to you later. Bye.

00:14:57.184 --> 00:15:01.492
MB: So he did, he called back that day again.

00:15:01.492 --> 00:15:05.373
He's left over 25 messages for Randolph

00:15:05.373 --> 00:15:08.125
over four years.

00:15:08.125 --> 00:15:10.216
You find out all about him

00:15:10.216 --> 00:15:11.852
and the grandma that he loves

00:15:11.852 --> 00:15:14.207
and the grandma that 
he likes a little bit less —

00:15:14.207 --> 00:15:16.400
(Laughter) —

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.827
and the crossword puzzles that he does,

00:15:18.827 --> 00:15:22.607
and this is — I'll play you one 
more message from Nico.

00:15:22.607 --> 00:15:25.910
This is the Christmas message from Nico.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.273
[Beep] (Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph,

00:15:28.273 --> 00:15:31.528
sorry I haven't talked to you in a long time.

00:15:31.528 --> 00:15:34.194
It's just that I've been so busy

00:15:34.194 --> 00:15:36.893
because school started,

00:15:36.893 --> 00:15:39.926
as you might not know, probably,

00:15:39.926 --> 00:15:43.807
since you're a whale, you don't know,

00:15:43.807 --> 00:15:48.487
and I'm calling you to just say,

00:15:48.487 --> 00:15:52.177
to wish you a merry Christmas.

00:15:52.177 --> 00:15:56.778
So have a nice Christmas,

00:15:56.778 --> 00:16:03.651
and bye-bye, Randolph. Goodbye.

00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:05.175
MB: I actually got Nico,

00:16:05.175 --> 00:16:08.306
I hadn't heard from in 18 months,

00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:12.424
and he just left a message two days ago.

00:16:12.424 --> 00:16:14.850
His voice is completely different,

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.350
but he put his babysitter on the phone,

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.211
and she was very nice to Randolph as well.

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:26.561
But Nico's the best reader I could hope for.

00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:30.287
I would want anyone I was writing for

00:16:30.287 --> 00:16:32.428
to be in that place emotionally

00:16:32.428 --> 00:16:34.664
with the things that I create.

00:16:34.664 --> 00:16:38.365
I feel lucky. Kids like Nico are the best readers,

00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:41.960
and they deserve the best stories we can give them.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.162
Thank you very much.

00:16:44.162 --> 00:16:46.817
(Applause)
