00:00:00.964 --> 00:00:03.734
When, in 1960, still a student,

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.159
I got a traveling fellowship

00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:09.220
to study housing in North America.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.504
We traveled the country.

00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:14.609
We saw public housing high-rise buildings

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.950
in all major cities:

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.030
New York, Philadelphia.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.999
Those who have no choice lived there.

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.294
And then we traveled from suburb to suburb,

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:26.342
and I came back thinking,

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:28.996
we've got to reinvent the apartment building.

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.675
There has to be another way of doing this.

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:33.710
We can't sustain suburbs,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.275
so let's design a building

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:39.518
which gives the qualities of a house

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:40.689
to each unit.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:44.850
Habitat would be all about gardens,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.755
contact with nature,

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.939
streets instead of corridors.

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:52.737
We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy,

00:00:52.737 --> 00:00:57.980
and there it is almost 50 years later.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.351
It's a very desirable place to live in.

00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:03.810
It's now a heritage building,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.413
but it did not proliferate.

00:01:07.413 --> 00:01:12.117
In 1973, I made my first trip to China.

00:01:12.117 --> 00:01:16.383
It was the Cultural Revolution.

00:01:16.383 --> 00:01:18.531
We traveled the country,

00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:21.760
met with architects and planners.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.976
This is Beijing then,

00:01:23.976 --> 00:01:26.848
not a single high rise building

00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:29.132
in Beijing or Shanghai.

00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:32.990
Shenzhen didn't even exist as a city.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.269
There were hardly any cars.

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:38.920
Thirty years later,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.915
this is Beijing today.

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:43.628
This is Hong Kong.

00:01:43.628 --> 00:01:46.128
If you're wealthy, you live there,

00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:48.548
if you're poor, you live there,

00:01:48.548 --> 00:01:51.214
but high density it is, and it's not just Asia.

00:01:51.214 --> 00:01:53.171
SÃ£o Paulo, you can travel

00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:55.695
in a helicopter 45 minutes

00:01:55.695 --> 00:01:57.705
seeing those high-rise buildings consume

00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:00.341
the 19th-century low-rise environment.

00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:02.652
And with it, comes congestion,

00:02:02.652 --> 00:02:06.674
and we lose mobility, and so on and so forth.

00:02:06.674 --> 00:02:09.224
So a few years ago, we decided to go back

00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:11.138
and rethink Habitat.

00:02:11.138 --> 00:02:13.827
Could we make it more affordable?

00:02:13.827 --> 00:02:16.890
Could we actually achieve this quality of life

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.297
in the densities that are prevailing today?

00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:24.160
And we realized, it's basically about light,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.222
it's about sun, it's about nature,

00:02:27.222 --> 00:02:29.402
it's about fractalization.

00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:32.631
Can we open up the surface of the building

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:35.499
so that it has more contact with the exterior?

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.738
We came up with a number of models:

00:02:37.738 --> 00:02:41.574
economy models, cheaper to build and more compact;

00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:43.621
membranes of housing

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.980
where people could design their own house

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.087
and create their own gardens.

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:51.968
And then we decided to take New York as a test case,

00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:54.015
and we looked at Lower Manhattan.

00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:57.840
And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.215
On the left is Manhattan today:

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:05.602
blue for housing, red for office buildings, retail.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.201
On the right, we reconfigured it:

00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:10.518
the office buildings form the base,

00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:13.781
and then rising 75 stories above,

00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:15.160
are apartments.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.136
There's a street in the air on the 25th level,

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:20.150
a community street.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.759
It's permeable.

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:23.712
There are gardens and open spaces

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:25.156
for the community,

00:03:25.156 --> 00:03:28.365
almost every unit with its own private garden,

00:03:28.365 --> 00:03:31.027
and community space all around.

00:03:31.027 --> 00:03:34.187
And most important, permeable, open.

00:03:34.187 --> 00:03:37.584
It does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city,

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:40.419
and light permeates everywhere.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.076
And in the last two or three years,

00:03:42.076 --> 00:03:44.648
we've actually been, for the first time,

00:03:44.648 --> 00:03:48.361
realizing the quality of life of Habitat

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:52.068
in real-life projects across Asia.

00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:55.302
This in Qinhuangdao in China:

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.880
middle-income housing, where there is a bylaw

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.587
that every apartment must receive

00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:03.343
three hours of sunlight.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:06.233
That's measured in the winter solstice.

00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:09.660
And under construction in Singapore,

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.882
again middle-income housing, gardens,

00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:16.748
community streets and parks and so on and so forth.

00:04:16.748 --> 00:04:19.198
And Colombo.

00:04:19.198 --> 00:04:21.414
And I want to touch on one more issue,

00:04:21.414 --> 00:04:25.099
which is the design of the public realm.

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.693
A hundred years after we've begun building

00:04:28.693 --> 00:04:30.425
with tall buildings,

00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:32.765
we are yet to understand

00:04:32.765 --> 00:04:35.690
how the tall high-rise building

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.525
becomes a building block in making a city,

00:04:38.525 --> 00:04:41.348
in creating the public realm.

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:43.767
In Singapore, we had an opportunity:

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:46.990
10 million square feet, extremely high density.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.112
Taking the concept of outdoor and indoor,

00:04:51.112 --> 00:04:53.363
promenades and parks integrated

00:04:53.363 --> 00:04:55.545
with intense urban life.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:59.133
So they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces,

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:01.110
and you move from one to the other,

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.217
and there is contact with nature,

00:05:03.217 --> 00:05:07.188
and most relevantly, at every level of the structure,

00:05:07.188 --> 00:05:09.877
public gardens and open space:

00:05:09.877 --> 00:05:11.643
on the roof of the podium,

00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:13.442
climbing up the towers,

00:05:13.442 --> 00:05:17.380
and finally on the roof, the sky park,

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.754
two and a half acres, jogging paths, restaurants,

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:26.109
and the world's longest swimming pool.

00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:28.865
And that's all I can tell you in five minutes.

00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:30.733
Thank you.

00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:33.430
(Applause)
