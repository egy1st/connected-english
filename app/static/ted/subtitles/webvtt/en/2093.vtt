WEBVTT

00:00:00.273 --> 00:00:04.298
We are at a remarkable moment in time.

00:00:04.298 --> 00:00:07.234
We face over the next two decades

00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:09.300
two fundamental transformations

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.342
that will determine whether the next 100 years

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:16.527
is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries.

00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:19.249
Let me illustrate with an example.

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.523
I first visited Beijing 25 years ago

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:25.549
to teach at the People's University of China.

00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:28.485
China was getting serious about market economics

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:30.824
and about university education,

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:35.315
so they decided to call in the foreign experts.

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:36.920
Like most other people,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.736
I moved around Beijing by bicycle.

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:41.930
Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.237
it was a safe and easy way to get around.

00:00:45.237 --> 00:00:46.601
Cycling in Beijing now

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:49.422
is a completely different prospect.

00:00:49.422 --> 00:00:52.565
The roads are jammed by cars and trucks.

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:54.364
The air is dangerously polluted

00:00:54.364 --> 00:00:57.976
from the burning of coal and diesel.

00:00:57.976 --> 00:01:00.114
When I was there last in the spring,

00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:02.892
there was an advisory for people of my age —

00:01:02.892 --> 00:01:05.322
over 65 —

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:08.191
to stay indoors and not move much.

00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:10.125
How did this come about?

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:12.545
It came from the way in which

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:14.810
Beijing has grown as a city.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.270
It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.446
from 10 million to 20 million.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.139
It's become a sprawling urban area

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:25.498
dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy,

00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:27.321
particularly coal.

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:31.596
China burns half the world's coal each year,

00:01:31.596 --> 00:01:35.510
and that's why, it is a key reason why,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.535
it is the world's largest emitter

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:40.449
of greenhouse gases.

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:42.563
At the same time, we have to recognize

00:01:42.563 --> 00:01:45.747
that in that period China has grown remarkably.

00:01:45.747 --> 00:01:48.188
It has become the world's second largest economy.

00:01:48.188 --> 00:01:49.657
Hundreds of millions of people

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:51.822
have been lifted out of poverty.

00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:53.903
That's really important.

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:56.220
But at the same time, the people of China

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.820
are asking the question:

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.400
What's the value of this growth

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.525
if our cities are unlivable?

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:03.837
They've analyzed, diagnosed

00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:07.177
that this is an unsustainable path of growth

00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:09.303
and development.

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:11.632
China's planning to scale back coal.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:17.493
It's looking to build its cities in different ways.

00:02:17.493 --> 00:02:19.326
Now, the growth of China

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:23.050
is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.817
in the structure of the world economy.

00:02:25.817 --> 00:02:28.539
Just 25 years ago, the developing countries,

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.429
the poorer countries of the world,

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:34.355
were, notwithstanding being
the vast majority of the people,

00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:36.178
they accounted for only about a third

00:02:36.178 --> 00:02:38.170
of the world's output.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.914
Now it's more than half;

00:02:39.914 --> 00:02:42.885
25 years from now, it will probably be two thirds

00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:45.990
from the countries that we saw 25 years ago

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.266
as developing.

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:48.864
That's a remarkable change.

00:02:48.864 --> 00:02:51.266
It means that most countries around the world,

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:53.325
rich or poor, are going to be facing

00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:55.305
the two fundamental transformations

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:58.490
that I want to talk about and highlight.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.503
Now, the first of these transformations

00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:03.110
is the basic structural change

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.850
of the economies and societies

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.880
that I've already begun to illustrate

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.390
through the description of Beijing.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.349
Fifty percent now in urban areas.

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.960
That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.221
Over the next two decades, we'll see

00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:22.134
the demand for energy rise by 40 percent,

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:26.108
and the growth in the economy and in the population

00:03:26.108 --> 00:03:29.090
is putting increasing pressure on our land,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.956
on our water and on our forests.

00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:36.241
This is profound structural change.

00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:37.816
If we manage it in a negligent

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:40.435
or a shortsighted way,

00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:44.301
we will create waste, pollution, congestion,

00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:47.851
destruction of land and forests.

00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:50.179
If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.902
with my numbers — cities, energy, land —

00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:55.781
if we manage all that badly,

00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.862
then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.673
of the people around the world

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:02.666
would be poor and damaged.

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:04.488
And more than that,

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:07.796
the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise,

00:04:07.796 --> 00:04:11.677
with immense risks to our climate.

00:04:11.677 --> 00:04:13.724
Concentrations of greenhouse gases

00:04:13.724 --> 00:04:16.642
in the atmosphere are already

00:04:16.642 --> 00:04:20.276
higher than they've been for millions of years.

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:23.914
If we go on increasing those concentrations,

00:04:23.914 --> 00:04:27.288
we risk temperatures over the next century or so

00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:28.905
that we have not seen on this planet

00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:32.110
for tens of millions of years.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.236
We've been around as Homo sapiens —

00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:37.407
that's a rather generous definition, sapiens —

00:04:37.407 --> 00:04:40.210
for perhaps a quarter of a million
years, a quarter of a million.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.441
We risk temperatures we haven't seen

00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:46.180
for tens of millions of years over a century.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.250
That would transform the relationship

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.479
between human beings and the planet.

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.130
It would lead to changing deserts,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.320
changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.558
changing sea levels,

00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:04.201
hundreds of millions of people,

00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:07.430
perhaps billions of people who would have to move,

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.353
and if we've learned anything from history,

00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:11.665
that means severe and extended conflict.

00:05:11.665 --> 00:05:13.543
And we couldn't just turn it off.

00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:15.973
You can't make a peace treaty with the planet.

00:05:15.973 --> 00:05:18.200
You can't negotiate with the laws of physics.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.915
You're in there. You're stuck.

00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:21.591
Those are the stakes we're playing for,

00:05:21.591 --> 00:05:24.313
and that's why we have to make
this second transformation,

00:05:24.313 --> 00:05:25.953
the climate transformation,

00:05:25.953 --> 00:05:28.336
and move to a low-carbon economy.

00:05:28.336 --> 00:05:30.714
Now, the first of these transformations

00:05:30.714 --> 00:05:31.795
is going to happen anyway.

00:05:31.795 --> 00:05:33.644
We have to decide whether to do it well or badly,

00:05:33.644 --> 00:05:36.462
the economic, or structural, transformation.

00:05:36.462 --> 00:05:38.352
But the second of the transformations,

00:05:38.352 --> 00:05:42.466
the climate transformations, we have to decide to do.

00:05:42.466 --> 00:05:44.685
Those two transformations face us

00:05:44.685 --> 00:05:46.858
in the next two decades.

00:05:46.858 --> 00:05:50.071
The next two decades are decisive

00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:52.786
for what we have to do.

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:54.305
Now, the more I've thought about this,

00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:56.409
the two transformations coming together,

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:57.956
the more I've come to realize

00:05:57.956 --> 00:06:00.908
that this is an enormous opportunity.

00:06:00.908 --> 00:06:03.135
It's an opportunity which we can use

00:06:03.135 --> 00:06:06.532
or it's an opportunity which we can lose.

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:09.255
And let me explain through those three key areas

00:06:09.255 --> 00:06:11.965
that I've identified: cities, energy and land.

00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:14.019
And let me start with cities.

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:18.052
I've already described the problems of Beijing:

00:06:18.052 --> 00:06:20.898
pollution, congestion, waste and so on.

00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:24.588
Surely we recognize that in many of our cities

00:06:24.588 --> 00:06:25.847
around the world.

00:06:25.847 --> 00:06:28.772
Now, with cities, like life but particularly cities,

00:06:28.772 --> 00:06:31.836
you have to think ahead.

00:06:31.836 --> 00:06:33.250
The cities that are going to be built —

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.406
and there are many, and many big ones —

00:06:35.406 --> 00:06:36.870
we have to think of how to design them

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.221
in a compact way

00:06:38.221 --> 00:06:41.664
so we can save travel time 
and we can save energy.

00:06:41.664 --> 00:06:45.579
The cities that already are 
there, well established,

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:48.650
we have to think about renewal
and investment in them

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.428
so that we can connect ourselves much better

00:06:51.428 --> 00:06:53.820
within those cities, and make it easier,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.411
encourage more people, to live closer to the center.

00:06:57.411 --> 00:06:59.821
We've got examples building around the world

00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:02.113
of the kinds of ways in which we can do that.

00:07:02.113 --> 00:07:06.131
The bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombia

00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:08.763
is a very important case of how to move around

00:07:08.763 --> 00:07:11.333
safely and quickly in a non-polluting way

00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:14.528
in a city: very frequent buses,

00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:17.465
strongly protected routes, the same service, really,

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:19.556
as an underground railway system,

00:07:19.556 --> 00:07:21.367
but much, much cheaper

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:23.775
and can be done much more quickly,

00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:25.670
a brilliant idea in many more cities

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.706
around the world that's developing.

00:07:27.706 --> 00:07:29.607
Now, some things in cities do take time.

00:07:29.607 --> 00:07:32.660
Some things in cities can happen much more quickly.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.764
Take my hometown, London.

00:07:34.764 --> 00:07:40.052
In 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 people

00:07:40.052 --> 00:07:42.746
and badly damaged the lives of many, many more.

00:07:42.746 --> 00:07:44.096
And it happened all the time.

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:46.598
For those of you live outside London in the U.K.

00:07:46.598 --> 00:07:48.791
will remember it used to be called The Smoke.

00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:50.467
That's the way London was.

00:07:50.467 --> 00:07:52.549
By regulating coal, within a few years

00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:55.637
the problems of smog were rapidly reduced.

00:07:55.637 --> 00:07:57.192
I remember the smogs well.

00:07:57.192 --> 00:07:59.915
When the visibility dropped to [less] than

00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:01.908
a few meters,

00:08:01.908 --> 00:08:03.764
they stopped the buses and I had to walk.

00:08:03.764 --> 00:08:05.822
This was the 1950s.

00:08:05.822 --> 00:08:09.720
I had to walk home three miles from school.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.289
Again, breathing was a hazardous activity.

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:15.967
But it was changed. It was changed by a decision.

00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:19.136
Good decisions can bring good results,

00:08:19.136 --> 00:08:21.501
striking results, quickly.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.494
We've seen more: In London, we've
introduced the congestion charge,

00:08:24.494 --> 00:08:27.200
actually quite quickly and effectively,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.820
and we've seen great improvements

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.782
in the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system.

00:08:32.782 --> 00:08:35.902
You can see that the two
transformations I've described,

00:08:35.902 --> 00:08:37.858
the structural and the climate,

00:08:37.858 --> 00:08:40.490
come very much together.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.423
But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities,

00:08:43.423 --> 00:08:45.956
and we have to invest wisely, and if we do,

00:08:45.956 --> 00:08:50.492
we'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities,

00:08:50.492 --> 00:08:53.149
more attractive cities, more productive cities,

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:55.916
and stronger community in those cities —

00:08:55.916 --> 00:08:58.164
public transport, recycling, reusing,

00:08:58.164 --> 00:09:02.213
all sorts of things that bring communities together.

00:09:02.213 --> 00:09:04.070
We can do that, but we have to think,

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.350
we have to invest, we have to plan.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.521
Let me turn to energy.

00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:11.743
Now, energy over the last 25 years

00:09:11.743 --> 00:09:13.979
has increased by about 50 percent.

00:09:13.979 --> 00:09:16.596
Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels.

00:09:16.596 --> 00:09:18.254
Over the next 20 years,

00:09:18.254 --> 00:09:22.030
perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.564
We have to invest strongly in energy,

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.838
we have to use it much more efficiently,

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:29.526
and we have to make it clean.

00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:30.856
We can see how to do that.

00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:32.760
Take the example of California.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.370
It would be in the top 10 countries in the world

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.913
if it was independent.

00:09:37.913 --> 00:09:40.478
I don't want to start any —

00:09:40.478 --> 00:09:43.976
(Laughter)

00:09:43.976 --> 00:09:45.821
California's a big place.

00:09:45.821 --> 00:09:47.869
(Laughter)

00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:50.610
In the next five or six years,

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.324
they will likely move from

00:09:53.324 --> 00:09:55.563
around 20 percent in renewables —

00:09:55.563 --> 00:09:57.320
wind, solar and so on —

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.793
to over 33 percent,

00:09:59.793 --> 00:10:02.232
and that would bring California back

00:10:02.232 --> 00:10:04.765
to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020

00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:06.722
to where they were in 1990,

00:10:06.722 --> 00:10:08.466
a period when the economy in California

00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:09.898
would more or less have doubled.

00:10:09.898 --> 00:10:11.348
That's a striking achievement.

00:10:11.348 --> 00:10:12.831
It shows what can be done.

00:10:12.831 --> 00:10:16.138
Not just California — the 
incoming government of India

00:10:16.138 --> 00:10:19.164
is planning to get solar technology

00:10:19.164 --> 00:10:20.536
to light up the homes

00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:22.246
of 400 million people

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:24.311
who don't have electricity in India.

00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:26.791
They've set themselves a target of five years.

00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:30.020
I think they've got a good chance of doing that.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.679
We'll see, but what you're seeing now

00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:34.990
is people moving much more quickly.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.724
Four hundred million, more than the population

00:10:36.724 --> 00:10:38.850
of the United States.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.943
Those are the kinds of ambitions now

00:10:40.943 --> 00:10:42.649
people are setting themselves

00:10:42.649 --> 00:10:47.129
in terms of rapidity of change.

00:10:47.129 --> 00:10:49.099
Again, you can see

00:10:49.099 --> 00:10:50.880
good decisions can bring quick results,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.913
and those two transformations,
the economy and the structure

00:10:53.913 --> 00:10:55.904
and the climate and the low carbon,

00:10:55.904 --> 00:10:58.447
are intimately intertwined.

00:10:58.447 --> 00:11:00.269
Do the first one well, the structural,

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:02.250
the second one on the climate

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.432
becomes much easier.

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:07.221
Look at land,

00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:09.809
land and particularly forests.

00:11:09.809 --> 00:11:12.869
Forests are the hosts to valuable

00:11:12.869 --> 00:11:15.398
plant and animal species.

00:11:15.398 --> 00:11:17.746
They hold water in the soil

00:11:17.746 --> 00:11:20.664
and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,

00:11:20.664 --> 00:11:23.733
fundamental to the tackling of climate change.

00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:25.965
But we're losing our forests.

00:11:25.965 --> 00:11:28.792
In the last decade, we've lost a forest area

00:11:28.792 --> 00:11:30.935
the size of Portugal,

00:11:30.935 --> 00:11:33.398
and much more has been degraded.

00:11:33.398 --> 00:11:35.153
But we're already seeing

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.560
that we can do so much about that.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.597
We can recognize the problem, but we can also

00:11:39.597 --> 00:11:41.711
understand how to tackle it.

00:11:41.711 --> 00:11:44.366
In Brazil, the rate of deforestation

00:11:44.366 --> 00:11:46.383
has been reduced by 70 percent

00:11:46.383 --> 00:11:48.945
over the last 10 years.

00:11:48.945 --> 00:11:51.930
How? By involving local communities,

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.751
investing in their agriculture and their economies,

00:11:54.751 --> 00:11:56.851
by monitoring more carefully,

00:11:56.851 --> 00:12:00.496
by enforcing the law more strictly.

00:12:00.496 --> 00:12:02.386
And it's not just stopping deforestation.

00:12:02.386 --> 00:12:04.827
That's of course of first and fundamental importance,

00:12:04.827 --> 00:12:08.449
but it's also regrading degraded land,

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:12.849
regenerating, rehabilitating degraded land.

00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:16.729
I first went to Ethiopia in 1967.

00:12:16.729 --> 00:12:19.204
It was desperately poor. In the following years,

00:12:19.204 --> 00:12:20.950
it suffered devastating famines

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.806
and profoundly destructive social conflict.

00:12:24.806 --> 00:12:27.640
Over the last few years, actually more than a few,

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.565
Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly.

00:12:30.565 --> 00:12:32.455
It has ambitions to be a middle-income country

00:12:32.455 --> 00:12:34.960
15 years from now

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.203
and to be carbon neutral.

00:12:37.203 --> 00:12:40.251
Again, I think it's a strong ambition

00:12:40.251 --> 00:12:42.546
but it is a plausible one.

00:12:42.546 --> 00:12:43.957
You're seeing that commitment there.

00:12:43.957 --> 00:12:45.223
You're seeing what can be done.

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:47.788
Ethiopia is investing in clean energy.

00:12:47.788 --> 00:12:51.410
It's working in the rehabilitation of land.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.840
In Humbo, in southwest Ethiopia,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.257
a wonderful project

00:12:55.257 --> 00:12:57.440
to plant trees on degraded land

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.060
and work with local communities

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.509
on sustainable forest management

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:04.550
has led to big increases in living standards.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.414
So we can see, from Beijing to London,

00:13:08.414 --> 00:13:10.703
from California to India,

00:13:10.703 --> 00:13:13.830
from Brazil to Ethiopia,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.439
we do understand

00:13:15.439 --> 00:13:17.644
how to manage those two transformations,

00:13:17.644 --> 00:13:19.573
the structural and the climate.

00:13:19.573 --> 00:13:23.752
We do understand how to manage those well.

00:13:23.752 --> 00:13:26.530
And technology is changing very rapidly.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.937
I don't have to list all those things

00:13:28.937 --> 00:13:30.828
to an audience like this,

00:13:30.828 --> 00:13:33.122
but you can see the electric cars,

00:13:33.122 --> 00:13:36.206
you can see the batteries using new materials.

00:13:36.206 --> 00:13:38.601
You can see that we can manage remotely now

00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:42.156
our household appliances on our
mobile phones when we're away.

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:43.963
You can see better insulation.

00:13:43.963 --> 00:13:45.886
And there's much more coming.

00:13:45.886 --> 00:13:48.283
But, and it's a big but,

00:13:48.283 --> 00:13:49.892
the world as a whole

00:13:49.892 --> 00:13:52.670
is moving far too slowly.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.212
We're not cutting emissions in the way we should.

00:13:55.212 --> 00:13:57.923
We're not managing those structural transformations

00:13:57.923 --> 00:14:00.152
as we can.

00:14:00.152 --> 00:14:03.391
The depth of understanding of the
immense risks of climate change

00:14:03.391 --> 00:14:06.970
are not there yet.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.101
The depth of understanding

00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:11.586
of the attractiveness of what we can do

00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:15.250
is not there yet.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.748
We need political pressure to build.

00:14:18.748 --> 00:14:22.280
We need leaders to step up.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.779
We can have better growth,

00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:29.986
better climate, a better world.

00:14:29.986 --> 00:14:31.798
We can make,

00:14:31.798 --> 00:14:34.578
by managing those two transformations well,

00:14:34.578 --> 00:14:38.866
the next 100 years the best of centuries.

00:14:38.866 --> 00:14:40.093
If we make a mess of it,

00:14:40.093 --> 00:14:43.240
we, you and me, if we make a mess of it,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.713
if we don't manage those transformations properly,

00:14:45.713 --> 00:14:48.604
it will be, the next 100 years

00:14:48.604 --> 00:14:51.335
will be the worst of centuries.

00:14:51.335 --> 00:14:53.227
That's the major conclusion

00:14:53.227 --> 00:14:56.358
of the report on the economy and climate

00:14:56.358 --> 00:15:00.227
chaired by ex-President Felipe Calderón of Mexico,

00:15:00.227 --> 00:15:02.407
and I co-chaired that with him,

00:15:02.407 --> 00:15:04.360
and we handed that report yesterday

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.350
here in New York, in the United Nations Building

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.822
to the Secretary-General of the U.N.,

00:15:08.822 --> 00:15:10.088
Ban Ki-moon.

00:15:10.088 --> 00:15:14.193
We know that we can do this.

00:15:14.193 --> 00:15:17.575
Now, two weeks ago,

00:15:17.575 --> 00:15:20.975
I became a grandfather for the fourth time.

00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:23.107
Our daughter —

00:15:23.107 --> 00:15:33.710
(Baby cries) (Laughter) (Applause) —

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.621
Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York

00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:39.626
two weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa.

00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:44.115
(Applause)

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.838
Two weeks old.

00:15:49.838 --> 00:15:55.525
Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye

00:15:55.525 --> 00:15:59.272
and tell them that we understood the issues,

00:15:59.272 --> 00:16:02.590
that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities,

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.831
and still we failed to act?

00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:10.310
Surely not. Let's make the next 100 years

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.116
the best of centuries.

00:16:12.116 --> 00:16:16.116
(Applause)
