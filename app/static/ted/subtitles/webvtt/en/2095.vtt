00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.555
When I turned 19, I started my career

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:05.985
as the first female photojournalist

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.180
in the Gaza Strip, Palestine.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.294
My work as a woman photographer

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:13.398
was considered a serious insult

00:00:13.398 --> 00:00:15.153
to local traditions,

00:00:15.153 --> 00:00:17.201
and created a lasting stigma

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:20.010
for me and my family.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.022
The male-dominated field made my presence

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:26.092
unwelcome by all possible means.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.810
They made clear that a woman

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.407
must not do a man's job.

00:00:30.407 --> 00:00:32.747
Photo agencies in Gaza refused to train me

00:00:32.747 --> 00:00:35.210
because of my gender.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.933
The "No" sign was pretty clear.

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.304
Three of my colleagues

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:44.180
went as far as to drive me to an open air strike area

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.156
where the explosion sounds

00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:48.451
were the only thing I could hear.

00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:50.566
Dust was flying in the air,

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:54.525
and the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me.

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:57.878
I only realized we weren't
there to document the event

00:00:57.878 --> 00:01:00.848
when the three of them got back into the armored Jeep

00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:03.502
and drove away, waving and laughing,

00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:08.351
leaving me behind in the open air strike zone.

00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:11.388
For a moment, I felt terrified,

00:01:11.388 --> 00:01:15.623
humiliated, and sorry for myself.

00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:17.687
My colleagues' action was not

00:01:17.687 --> 00:01:20.354
the only death threat I have received,

00:01:20.354 --> 00:01:24.392
but it was the most dangerous one.

00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:27.407
The perception of women's life in Gaza

00:01:27.407 --> 00:01:29.387
is passive.

00:01:29.387 --> 00:01:32.747
Until a recent time, a lot of 
women were not allowed

00:01:32.747 --> 00:01:35.717
to work or pursue education.

00:01:35.717 --> 00:01:38.788
At times of such doubled war including

00:01:38.788 --> 00:01:40.970
both social restrictions on women

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.954
and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:47.972
women's dark and bright stories were fading away.

00:01:47.972 --> 00:01:50.300
To men, women's stories were seen

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.257
as inconsequential.

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:55.329
I started paying closer attention

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.366
to women's lives in Gaza.

00:01:57.366 --> 00:02:00.065
Because of my gender, I had access

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:04.643
to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden.

00:02:04.643 --> 00:02:07.077
Beyond the obvious pain and struggle,

00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:08.862
there was a healthy dose

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:11.682
of laughter and accomplishments.

00:02:11.682 --> 00:02:15.201
In front of a police compound in Gaza City

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.240
during the first war in Gaza,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.593
an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound

00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:23.740
and break my nose.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.351
For a moment, all I saw was white, bright white,

00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:30.848
like these lights.

00:02:30.848 --> 00:02:34.211
I thought to myself I either got blind

00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:37.100
or I was in heaven.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.320
By the time I managed to open my eyes,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.531
I had documented this moment.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.874
Mohammed Khader, a Palestinian worker

00:02:46.874 --> 00:02:50.043
who spent two decades in Israel,

00:02:50.043 --> 00:02:51.936
as his retirement plan,

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:55.266
he decided to build a four-floor house,

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:59.563
only by the first field operation at his neighborhood,

00:02:59.563 --> 00:03:02.995
the house was flattened to the ground.

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:06.544
Nothing was left but the pigeons he raised

00:03:06.544 --> 00:03:09.709
and a jacuzzi, a bathtub

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.953
that he got from Tel Aviv.

00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:13.750
Mohammed got the bathtub

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.516
on the top of the rubble

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:18.140
and started giving his kids

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.198
an every morning bubble bath.

00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:25.460
My work is not meant to hide the scars of war,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.541
but to show the full frame

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:30.748
of unseen stories of Gazans.

00:03:30.748 --> 00:03:34.122
As a Palestinian female photographer,

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:38.830
the journey of struggle, survival and everyday life

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.151
has inspired me to overcome the community taboo

00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:47.318
and see a different side of war and its aftermath.

00:03:47.318 --> 00:03:51.390
I became a witness with a choice:

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.170
to run away or stand still.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.408
Thank you.

00:03:57.408 --> 00:03:58.979
(Applause)
