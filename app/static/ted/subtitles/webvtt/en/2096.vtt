00:00:00.824 --> 00:00:04.517
I've been a critical care EMT for the past
seven years in Suffolk County, New York.

00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:06.359
I've been a first responder in a number of incidents

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.677
ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy.

00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:11.421
If you are like most people, death might be

00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:13.389
one of your greatest fears.

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.810
Some of us will see it coming.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.809
Some of us won't.

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:18.913
There is a little-known documented medical term

00:00:18.913 --> 00:00:20.859
called impending doom.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.186
It's almost a symptom.

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:23.919
As a medical provider, I'm trained to respond

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.741
to this symptom like any other,

00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.282
so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:29.510
and says, "I'm going to die today,"

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.236
we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition.

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:35.382
Throughout my career, I have responded

00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:37.328
to a number of incidents where the patient

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.965
had minutes left to live

00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:42.090
and there was nothing I could do for them.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.876
With this, I was faced with a dilemma:

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:48.588
Do I tell the dying that they are about to face death,

00:00:48.588 --> 00:00:51.615
or do I lie to them to comfort them?

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:53.808
Early in my career, I faced this dilemma

00:00:53.808 --> 00:00:55.366
by simply lying.

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.295
I was afraid.

00:00:57.295 --> 00:00:59.635
I was afraid if I told them the truth,

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:02.976
that they would die in terror, in fear,

00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:06.182
just grasping for those last moments of life.

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:08.950
That all changed with one incident.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.799
Five years ago, I responded to a motorcycle accident.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.601
The rider had suffered critical, critical injuries.

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:17.432
As I assessed him, I realized that there was nothing

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:19.399
that could be done for him,

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.664
and like so many other cases,
he looked me in the eye

00:01:22.664 --> 00:01:27.076
and asked that question: "Am I going to die?"

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:30.582
In that moment, I decided to do something different.

00:01:30.582 --> 00:01:33.462
I decided to tell him the truth.

00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:36.556
I decided to tell him that he was going to die

00:01:36.556 --> 00:01:39.820
and that there was nothing I could do for him.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.596
His reaction shocked me to this day.

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:45.501
He simply laid back and had a look

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.927
of acceptance on his face.

00:01:47.927 --> 00:01:49.630
He was not met with that terror or fear

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.010
that I thought he would be.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.222
He simply laid there, and as I looked into his eyes,

00:01:55.222 --> 00:01:57.950
I saw inner peace and acceptance.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.688
From that moment forward, I decided

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:04.402
it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies.

00:02:04.402 --> 00:02:07.147
Having responded to many cases since then

00:02:07.147 --> 00:02:09.655
where patients were in their last moments

00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:11.511
and there was nothing I could do for them,

00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:13.150
in almost every case,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.484
they have all had the same reaction to the truth,

00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:18.550
of inner peace and acceptance.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.972
In fact, there are three patterns

00:02:20.972 --> 00:02:25.247
I have observed in all these cases.

00:02:25.247 --> 00:02:28.903
The first pattern always kind of shocked me.

00:02:28.903 --> 00:02:32.840
Regardless of religious belief or cultural background,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.675
there's a need for forgiveness.

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:37.221
Whether they call it sin

00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:40.090
or they simply say they have a regret,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.503
their guilt is universal.

00:02:42.503 --> 00:02:43.899
I had once cared for an elderly gentleman

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:46.317
who was having a massive heart attack.

00:02:46.317 --> 00:02:48.443
As I prepared myself and my equipment

00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:51.368
for his imminent cardiac arrest,

00:02:51.368 --> 00:02:55.721
I began to tell the patient of his imminent demise.

00:02:55.721 --> 00:02:58.719
He already knew by my tone
of voice and body language.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.385
As I placed the defibrillator pads on his chest,

00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:03.289
prepping for what was going to happen,

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:05.817
he looked me in the eye and said,

00:03:05.817 --> 00:03:08.517
"I wish I had spent more time with
my children and grandchildren

00:03:08.517 --> 00:03:11.588
instead of being selfish with my time."

00:03:11.588 --> 00:03:13.920
Faced with imminent death,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.854
all he wanted was forgiveness.

00:03:16.854 --> 00:03:18.742
The second pattern I observe

00:03:18.742 --> 00:03:21.030
is the need for remembrance.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.287
Whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts

00:03:23.287 --> 00:03:25.001
or their loved ones', they needed to feel

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.150
that they would be living on.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.474
There's a need for immortality

00:03:29.474 --> 00:03:32.118
within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones,

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:35.391
myself, my crew, or anyone around.

00:03:35.391 --> 00:03:38.282
Countless times, I have had a 
patient look me in the eyes

00:03:38.282 --> 00:03:42.220
and say, "Will you remember me?"

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.672
The final pattern I observe

00:03:44.672 --> 00:03:47.900
always touched me the deepest, to the soul.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.440
The dying need to know that their life had meaning.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.222
They need to know that they did not waste their life

00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:57.170
on meaningless tasks.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.319
This came to me very, very early in my career.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.408
I had responded to a call.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.332
There was a female in her late 50s

00:04:04.332 --> 00:04:06.390
severely pinned within a vehicle.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.068
She had been t-boned at a high rate of speed,

00:04:10.068 --> 00:04:12.500
critical, critical condition.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.740
As the fire department worked
to remove her from the car,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.707
I climbed in to begin to render care.

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:20.767
As we talked, she had said to me,

00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:23.980
"There was so much more
I wanted to do with my life."

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.832
She had felt she had not left her mark on this Earth.

00:04:27.832 --> 00:04:29.789
As we talked further, it would turn out

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.197
that she was a mother of two adopted children

00:04:32.197 --> 00:04:35.312
who were both on their way to medical school.

00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:37.382
Because of her, two children

00:04:37.382 --> 00:04:40.100
had a chance they never would have had otherwise

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.321
and would go on to save lives in the medical field

00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:44.683
as medical doctors.

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:46.472
It would end up taking 45 minutes

00:04:46.472 --> 00:04:48.339
to free her from the vehicle.

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:52.569
However, she perished prior to freeing her.

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.661
I believed what you saw in the movies:

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:55.945
when you're in those last moments

00:04:55.945 --> 00:04:58.857
that it's strictly terror, fear.

00:04:58.857 --> 00:05:01.535
I have come to realize,
regardless of the circumstance,

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:04.448
it's generally met with peace and acceptance,

00:05:04.448 --> 00:05:08.140
that it's the littlest things, the littlest moments,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.704
the littlest things you brought into the world

00:05:11.704 --> 00:05:14.633
that give you peace in those final moments.

00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:16.665
Thank you.

00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:20.319
(Applause)
