WEBVTT

00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:02.009
I am an engineering professor,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.125
and for the past 14 years

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.933
I've been teaching crap.

00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.238
(Laughter)

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:10.255
Not that I'm a bad teacher,

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:12.373
but I've been studying and teaching

00:00:12.373 --> 00:00:14.260
about human waste

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.891
and how waste is conveyed

00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.774
through these wastewater treatment plants,

00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:20.349
and how we engineer and design

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.339
these treatment plants so that we can protect

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.421
surface water like rivers.

00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:27.071
I've based my scientific career

00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:30.508
on using leading-edge molecular techniques,

00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:33.120
DNA- and RNA-based methods

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.559
to look at microbial populations in biological reactors,

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.922
and again to optimize these systems.

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.171
And over the years,

00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:44.423
I have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets,

00:00:44.423 --> 00:00:47.415
and I've been known to sneak into toilets

00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:49.218
and take my camera phone

00:00:49.218 --> 00:00:51.566
all over the world.

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.790
But along the way, I've learned

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.332
that it's not just the technical side,

00:00:56.332 --> 00:01:00.510
but there's also this thing called the culture of crap.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.979
So for example,

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.286
how many of you are washers

00:01:04.286 --> 00:01:06.738
and how many of you are wipers?

00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:10.945
(Laughter)

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:14.882
If, well, I guess you know what I mean.

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:17.121
If you're a washer, then you use water

00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:19.933
for anal cleansing. That's the technical term.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.791
And if you're a wiper,

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.883
then you use toilet paper

00:01:24.883 --> 00:01:26.638
or, in some regions of the world

00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:30.272
where it's not available, newspaper

00:01:30.272 --> 00:01:33.792
or rags or corncobs.

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:36.290
And this is not just a piece of trivia,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.146
but it's really important to understand

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:40.339
and solve the sanitation problem.

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:42.623
And it is a big problem:

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:44.668
There are 2.5 billion people in the world

00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:47.829
who don't have access to adequate sanitation.

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.932
For them, there's no modern toilet.

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:53.843
And there are 1.1 billion people

00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:56.237
whose toilets are the streets

00:01:56.237 --> 00:01:59.163
or river banks or open spaces,

00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:01.142
and again, the technical term for that is

00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:03.179
open defecation,

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.283
but that is really simply

00:02:06.283 --> 00:02:08.342
shitting in the open.

00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:10.245
And if you're living in fecal material

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:12.580
and it's surrounding you, you're going to get sick.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.086
It's going to get into your drinking water,

00:02:14.086 --> 00:02:16.502
into your food, into your immediate surroundings.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:18.947
So the United Nations estimates

00:02:18.947 --> 00:02:23.059
that every year, there are 
1.5 million child deaths

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.768
because of inadequate sanitation.

00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:29.817
That's one preventable death every 20 seconds,

00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:32.427
171 every hour,

00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:35.645
4,100 every day.

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:37.737
And so, to avoid open defecation,

00:02:37.737 --> 00:02:39.912
municipalities and cities

00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:44.104
build infrastructure, for example, like pit latrines,

00:02:44.104 --> 00:02:46.026
in peri-urban and rural areas.

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:49.333
For example, in KwaZulu-Natal 
province in South Africa,

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:52.667
they've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines.

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:54.860
But there's a problem when you scale up

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.110
to tens of thousands, and the problem is,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.912
what happens when the pits are full?

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:01.497
This is what happens.

00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:03.871
People defecate around the toilet.

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:06.976
In schools, children defecate on the floors

00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:09.147
and then leave a trail outside the building

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:11.930
and start defecating around the building,

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.164
and these pits have to be cleaned

00:03:14.164 --> 00:03:16.695
and manually emptied.

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:18.043
And who does the emptying?

00:03:18.043 --> 00:03:20.565
You've got these workers

00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:23.299
who have to sometimes go down into the pits

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.700
and manually remove the contents.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.547
It's a dirty and dangerous business.

00:03:29.547 --> 00:03:31.865
As you can see, there's no protective equipment,

00:03:31.865 --> 00:03:33.454
no protective clothing.

00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:34.460
There's one worker down there.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.098
I hope you can see him.

00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:38.954
He's got a face mask on, but no shirt.

00:03:38.954 --> 00:03:41.385
And in some countries, like India,

00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:43.859
the lower castes are condemned

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.233
to empty the pits,

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:48.809
and they're further condemned by society.

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:51.756
So you ask yourself, how can we solve this

00:03:51.756 --> 00:03:54.591
and why don't we just build Western-style flush toilets

00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:57.112
for these two and a half billion?

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:59.417
And the answer is, it's just not possible.

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:02.275
In some of these areas, there's not enough water,

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:03.648
there's no energy,

00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:05.683
it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars

00:04:05.683 --> 00:04:07.258
to lay out the sewer lines

00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:08.129
and to build the facilities

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.523
and to operate and maintain these systems,

00:04:10.523 --> 00:04:12.095
and if you don't build it right,

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:13.996
you're going to have flush toilets

00:04:13.996 --> 00:04:16.404
that basically go straight into the river,

00:04:16.404 --> 00:04:18.879
just like what's happening in many cities

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:20.272
in the developing world.

00:04:20.272 --> 00:04:22.321
And is this really the solution?

00:04:22.321 --> 00:04:24.211
Because essentially, what you're doing is

00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:26.596
you're using clean water

00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:28.661
and you're using it to flush your toilet,

00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:31.147
convey it to a wastewater treatment plant

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:32.891
which then discharges to a river,

00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:35.647
and that river, again, is a drinking water source.

00:04:35.647 --> 00:04:37.942
So we've got to rethink sanitation,

00:04:37.942 --> 00:04:42.507
and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure,

00:04:42.507 --> 00:04:44.408
and I'm going to argue that to do this,

00:04:44.408 --> 00:04:46.725
you have to employ systems thinking.

00:04:46.725 --> 00:04:49.695
We have to look at the whole sanitation chain.

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:51.968
We start with a human interface,

00:04:51.968 --> 00:04:53.869
and then we have to think about how feces

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:56.253
are collected and stored,

00:04:56.253 --> 00:04:58.975
transported, treated and reused â€”

00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:01.140
and not just disposal but reuse.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.633
So let's start with the human user interface.

00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:07.457
I say, it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper,

00:05:07.457 --> 00:05:09.460
a sitter or a squatter,

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.552
the human user interface should be clean

00:05:11.552 --> 00:05:14.353
and easy to use, because after all,

00:05:14.353 --> 00:05:16.727
taking a dump should be pleasurable.

00:05:16.727 --> 00:05:19.348
(Laughter)

00:05:19.348 --> 00:05:22.205
And when we open the possibilities

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:24.916
to understanding this sanitation chain,

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:26.986
then the back-end technology,

00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:30.676
the collection to the reuse, should not really matter,

00:05:30.676 --> 00:05:31.969
and then we can apply

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.806
locally adoptable and context-sensitive solutions.

00:05:35.806 --> 00:05:38.506
So we can open ourselves to possibilities like,

00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:41.401
for example, this urine-diverting toilet,

00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:43.233
and there's two holes in this toilet.

00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:44.415
There's the front and the back,

00:05:44.415 --> 00:05:46.489
and the front collects the urine,

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:48.393
and the back collects the fecal material.

00:05:48.393 --> 00:05:50.239
And so what you're doing is
you're separating the urine,

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:52.308
which has 80 percent of the nitrogen

00:05:52.308 --> 00:05:54.558
and 50 percent of the phosphorus,

00:05:54.558 --> 00:05:56.639
and then that can then be treated

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.260
and precipitated to form things like struvite,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.229
which is a high-value fertilizer,

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.727
and then the fecal material can then be disinfected

00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:07.416
and again converted to high-value end products.

00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:09.621
Or, for example, in some of our research,

00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:12.264
you can reuse the water by treating it

00:06:12.264 --> 00:06:14.402
in on-site sanitation systems

00:06:14.402 --> 00:06:17.163
like planter boxes or constructed wetlands.

00:06:17.163 --> 00:06:19.846
So we can open up all these possibilities

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:23.334
if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets

00:06:23.334 --> 00:06:25.000
and treatment plants.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.418
So you might be asking, who's going to pay?

00:06:28.418 --> 00:06:30.376
Well, I'm going to argue that governments

00:06:30.376 --> 00:06:33.807
should fund sanitation infrastructure.

00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:36.338
NGOs and donor organizations,

00:06:36.338 --> 00:06:39.758
they can do their best, but it's not going to be enough.

00:06:39.758 --> 00:06:41.423
Governments should fund sanitation

00:06:41.423 --> 00:06:43.178
the same way they fund roads

00:06:43.178 --> 00:06:46.638
and schools and hospitals

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:48.790
and other infrastructure like bridges,

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.893
because we know, and the WHO has done this study,

00:06:51.893 --> 00:06:53.727
that for every dollar that we invest

00:06:53.727 --> 00:06:55.616
in sanitation infrastructure,

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:59.126
we get something like three to 34 dollars back.

00:06:59.126 --> 00:07:01.578
Let's go back to the problem of pit emptying.

00:07:01.578 --> 00:07:03.073
So at North Carolina State University,

00:07:03.073 --> 00:07:06.260
we challenged our students to
come up with a simple solution,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.744
and this is what they came up with:

00:07:07.744 --> 00:07:10.387
a simple, modified screw auger

00:07:10.387 --> 00:07:12.321
that can move the waste up

00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:14.840
from the pit and into a collecting drum,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.336
and now the pit worker

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:18.441
doesn't have to go down into the pit.

00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:20.347
We tested it in South Africa, and it works.

00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:22.075
We need to make it more robust,

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:23.368
and we're going to do more testing

00:07:23.368 --> 00:07:25.934
in Malawi and South Africa this coming year.

00:07:25.934 --> 00:07:27.553
And our idea is to make this

00:07:27.553 --> 00:07:30.060
a professionalized pit-emptying service

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.638
so that we can create a small business out of it,

00:07:32.638 --> 00:07:34.471
create profits and jobs,

00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:35.855
and the hope is that,

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:37.646
as we are rethinking sanitation,

00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:41.024
we are extending the life of these pits

00:07:41.024 --> 00:07:43.172
so that we don't have to resort

00:07:43.172 --> 00:07:44.977
to quick solutions

00:07:44.977 --> 00:07:46.941
that don't really make sense.

00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:50.569
I believe that access to adequate sanitation

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:52.493
is a basic human right.

00:07:52.493 --> 00:07:54.110
We need to stop the practice

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.900
of lower castes and lower-status people

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.442
going down and being condemned to empty pits.

00:08:00.442 --> 00:08:02.422
It is our moral, it is our social

00:08:02.422 --> 00:08:04.571
and our environmental obligation.

00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:06.640
Thank you.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.315
(Applause)
