00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:02.523
Women represent

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:05.574
50 percent of middle management

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:08.363
and professional positions,

00:00:08.363 --> 00:00:11.491
but the percentages of women
at the top of organizations

00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:14.315
represent not even a third of that number.

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:17.820
So some people hear that statistic and they ask,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.323
why do we have so few women leaders?

00:00:21.323 --> 00:00:23.246
But I look at that statistic

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:26.020
and, if you, like me, believe

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.800
that leadership manifests at every level,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.786
you would see that there's a tremendous,

00:00:32.786 --> 00:00:35.767
awesome resource of leaders

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:38.523
who are leading in middle management,

00:00:38.523 --> 00:00:41.639
which raises a different question:

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:43.889
Why are there so many women

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:45.880
mired in the middle

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.702
and what has to happen

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:50.245
to take them to the top?

00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:52.764
So some of you might be some of those women

00:00:52.764 --> 00:00:54.587
who are in middle management

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:58.513
and seeking to move up in your organization.

00:00:58.513 --> 00:01:02.135
Well, Tonya is a great example
of one of these women.

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:03.834
I met her two years ago.

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:07.170
She was a vice president in a Fortune 50 company,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.393
and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration,

00:01:11.393 --> 00:01:14.791
"I've worked really hard to improve my confidence

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:18.154
and my assertiveness and develop a great brand,

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:21.979
I get terrific performance evals from my boss,

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.218
my 360s in the organization let me know

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:28.515
that my teams love working for me,

00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:32.351
I've taken every management course that I can here,

00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:34.916
I am working with a terrific mentor,

00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:37.334
and yet I've been passed over

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:40.507
twice for advancement opportunities,

00:01:40.507 --> 00:01:42.790
even when my manager knows

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.601
that I'm committed to moving up

00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:49.236
and even interested in an international assignment.

00:01:49.236 --> 00:01:51.148
I don't understand why

00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:53.117
I'm being passed over."

00:01:53.117 --> 00:01:55.345
So what Tonya doesn't realize

00:01:55.345 --> 00:01:58.369
is that there's a missing 33 percent

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.990
of the career success equation for women,

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.815
and it's understanding what this missing 33 percent is

00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:10.529
that's required to close the gender gap at the top.

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.543
In order to move up in organizations,

00:02:13.543 --> 00:02:16.162
you have to be known for your leadership skills,

00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:17.741
and this would apply to any of you,

00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:20.290
women or men.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.294
It means that you have to be recognized

00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:25.971
for using the greatness in you

00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:29.222
to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes

00:02:29.222 --> 00:02:32.901
by engaging the greatness in others.

00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:34.291
Put in other language,

00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:36.309
it means you have to use your skills

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:38.705
and talents and abilities

00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:41.113
to help the organization achieve

00:02:41.113 --> 00:02:44.262
its strategic financial goals

00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:47.907
and do that by working effectively with others

00:02:47.907 --> 00:02:51.901
inside of the organization and outside.

00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:54.196
And although all three of these elements

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:56.232
of leadership are important,

00:02:56.232 --> 00:02:58.931
when it comes to moving up in organizations,

00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:00.788
they aren't equally important.

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:03.533
So pay attention to the green box

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:07.548
as I move forward.

00:03:07.548 --> 00:03:10.340
In seeking and identifying

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.357
employees with high potential,

00:03:12.357 --> 00:03:17.006
the potential to go to the top of organizations,

00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:20.400
the skills and competencies

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.380
that relate to that green box

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.753
are rated twice as heavily

00:03:24.753 --> 00:03:28.567
as those in the other two elements of leadership.

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:30.637
These skills and competencies

00:03:30.637 --> 00:03:33.337
can be summarized as business,

00:03:33.337 --> 00:03:36.509
strategic, and financial acumen.

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.170
In other words, this skill set has to do

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.483
with understanding where the organization is going,

00:03:43.483 --> 00:03:45.621
what its strategy is,

00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:48.140
what financial targets it has in place,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.570
and understanding your role

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.247
in moving the organization forward.

00:03:52.247 --> 00:03:56.445
This is that missing 33 percent

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:59.425
of the career success equation for women,

00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:01.978
not because it's missing in our capabilities

00:04:01.978 --> 00:04:03.598
or abilities,

00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:05.724
but because it's missing in the advice

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:07.378
that we're given.

00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:09.147
Here's what I mean by that.

00:04:09.147 --> 00:04:11.338
Five years ago, I was asked to moderate

00:04:11.338 --> 00:04:13.171
a panel of executives,

00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:15.160
and the topic for the evening was

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.538
"What do you look for in 
high-potential employees?"

00:04:18.538 --> 00:04:21.620
So think about the three elements of leadership

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.410
as I summarize for you what they told me.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.907
They said, "We look for people

00:04:26.907 --> 00:04:30.563
who are smart and hard working and committed

00:04:30.563 --> 00:04:34.669
and trustworthy and resilient."

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.503
So which element of leadership does that relate to?

00:04:38.503 --> 00:04:40.519
Personal greatness.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.200
They said, "We look for employees

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.529
who are great with our customers,

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:47.723
who empower their teams,

00:04:47.723 --> 00:04:49.781
who negotiate effectively,

00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:52.324
who are able to manage conflict well,

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:55.564
and are overall great communicators."

00:04:55.564 --> 00:04:58.874
Which element of leadership does that equate to?

00:04:58.874 --> 00:05:01.683
Engaging the greatness in others.

00:05:01.683 --> 00:05:03.889
And then they pretty much stopped.

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.120
So I asked,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.170
"Well, what about people

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.534
who understand your business,

00:05:09.534 --> 00:05:10.940
where it's going,

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.550
and their role in taking it there?

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.866
And what about people who are able

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:17.375
to scan the external environment,

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:20.176
identify risks and opportunities,

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:24.595
make strategy or make strategic recommendations?

00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:26.980
And what about people who are able

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.558
to look at the financials of your business,

00:05:29.558 --> 00:05:33.202
understand the story that the financials tell,

00:05:33.202 --> 00:05:35.470
and either take appropriate action

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.209
or make appropriate recommendations?"

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:40.155
And to a man, they said,

00:05:40.155 --> 00:05:42.347
"That's a given."

00:05:42.347 --> 00:05:43.945
So I turned to the audience

00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:46.976
of 150 women and I asked,

00:05:46.976 --> 00:05:49.878
"How many of you have ever been told

00:05:49.878 --> 00:05:52.837
that the door-opener for career advancement

00:05:52.837 --> 00:05:56.616
is your business, strategic and financial acumen,

00:05:56.616 --> 00:05:59.040
and that all the other important stuff

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.837
is what differentiates you in the talent pool?"

00:06:02.837 --> 00:06:05.965
Three women raised their hand,

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:08.100
and I've asked this question of women

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.644
all around the globe in the five years since,

00:06:10.644 --> 00:06:15.358
and the percentage is never much different.

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:17.495
So this is obvious, right?

00:06:17.495 --> 00:06:19.407
But how can it be?

00:06:19.407 --> 00:06:21.443
Well, there are primarily three reasons

00:06:21.443 --> 00:06:23.466
that there's this missing 33 percent

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:27.101
in the career success advice given to women?

00:06:27.101 --> 00:06:29.630
When organizations direct women

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.497
toward resources

00:06:31.497 --> 00:06:33.830
that focus on the conventional advice

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.798
that we've been hearing for over 40 years,

00:06:35.798 --> 00:06:39.804
there's a notable absence of advice that relates

00:06:39.804 --> 00:06:42.952
to business, strategic and financial acumen.

00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:45.787
Much of the advice is emphasizing

00:06:45.787 --> 00:06:47.621
personal actions that we need to take,

00:06:47.621 --> 00:06:50.321
like become more assertive, become more confident,

00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:52.030
develop your personal brand,

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.854
things that Tonya's been working on,

00:06:54.854 --> 00:06:57.381
and advice about working with other people,

00:06:57.381 --> 00:07:00.200
things like learn to self-promote,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.365
get a mentor, enhance your network,

00:07:02.365 --> 00:07:04.997
and virtually nothing said

00:07:04.997 --> 00:07:07.070
about the importance of business, strategic

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.294
and financial acumen.

00:07:09.294 --> 00:07:13.397
This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant.

00:07:13.397 --> 00:07:16.111
What it means is that this is advice

00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:19.115
that's absolutely essential for breaking through

00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:23.513
from career start to middle management,

00:07:23.513 --> 00:07:25.257
but it's not the advice

00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:27.507
that gets women to break through

00:07:27.507 --> 00:07:29.824
from the middle, where we're 50 percent,

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:32.377
to senior and executive positions.

00:07:32.377 --> 00:07:35.437
And this is why conventional advice to women

00:07:35.437 --> 00:07:39.532
in 40 years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top

00:07:39.532 --> 00:07:42.434
and won't close it.

00:07:42.434 --> 00:07:44.279
Now, the second reason

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:45.967
relates to Tonya's comments

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:50.418
about having had excellent performance evals,

00:07:50.418 --> 00:07:53.069
great feedback from her teams,

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:55.686
and having taken every management training program

00:07:55.686 --> 00:07:57.756
she can lay her hands on.

00:07:57.756 --> 00:08:00.708
So you would think that she's getting

00:08:00.708 --> 00:08:03.064
messages from her organization

00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:05.271
through the talent development systems

00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:07.745
and performance management systems

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:09.680
that let her know how important it is

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.141
to develop business, strategic and financial acumen,

00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:17.746
but here again, that green square is quite small.

00:08:17.746 --> 00:08:19.523
On average,

00:08:19.523 --> 00:08:21.829
talent and performance management systems

00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:24.383
in the organizations that I've worked with

00:08:24.383 --> 00:08:26.858
focus three to one

00:08:26.858 --> 00:08:29.186
on the other two elements of leadership

00:08:29.186 --> 00:08:31.672
compared to the importance of business,

00:08:31.672 --> 00:08:34.203
strategic and financial acumen,

00:08:34.203 --> 00:08:38.748
which is why typical talent and performance systems

00:08:38.748 --> 00:08:40.711
haven't closed and won't close

00:08:40.711 --> 00:08:43.968
the gender gap at the top.

00:08:43.968 --> 00:08:47.840
Now, Tonya also talked about working with a mentor,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.279
and this is really important to talk about,

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.900
because if organizations,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.754
talent and performance systems

00:08:53.754 --> 00:08:55.571
aren't giving people in general

00:08:55.571 --> 00:08:58.187
information about the importance of

00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:00.527
business, strategic and financial acumen,

00:09:00.527 --> 00:09:02.744
how are men getting to the top?

00:09:02.744 --> 00:09:05.263
Well, there are primarily two ways.

00:09:05.263 --> 00:09:07.130
One is because of the positions

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.222
they're guided into,

00:09:09.222 --> 00:09:12.193
and the other is because of informal mentoring

00:09:12.193 --> 00:09:13.947
and sponsorship.

00:09:13.947 --> 00:09:15.702
So what's women's experience

00:09:15.702 --> 00:09:17.907
as it relates to mentoring?

00:09:17.907 --> 00:09:20.809
Well, this comment from an executive

00:09:20.809 --> 00:09:22.586
that I worked with recently

00:09:22.586 --> 00:09:24.611
illustrates that experience.

00:09:24.611 --> 00:09:27.266
He was very proud of the fact that last year,

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:31.250
he had two protégés: a man and a woman.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.927
And he said, "I helped the woman build confidence,

00:09:34.927 --> 00:09:37.346
I helped the man learn the business,

00:09:37.346 --> 00:09:39.753
and I didn't realize that I was treating them

00:09:39.753 --> 00:09:41.227
any differently."

00:09:41.227 --> 00:09:43.645
And he was sincere about that.

00:09:43.645 --> 00:09:45.840
So what this illustrates is that

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.230
as managers, whether we're women or men,

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.260
we have mindsets about women and men,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.127
about careers in leadership,

00:09:52.127 --> 00:09:55.150
and these unexamined mindsets

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.922
won't close the gender gap at the top.

00:09:58.922 --> 00:10:00.670
So how do we take this idea

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.713
of the missing 33 percent

00:10:02.713 --> 00:10:04.884
and turn it into action?

00:10:04.884 --> 00:10:08.281
Well, for women, the answer is obvious:

00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:10.554
we have to begin to focus more

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:12.491
on developing and demonstrating

00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:14.190
the skills we have

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.639
that show that we're people who understand

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:18.912
our businesses, where they're headed,

00:10:18.912 --> 00:10:21.330
and our role in taking it there.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.726
That's what enables that breakthrough

00:10:23.726 --> 00:10:25.999
from middle management

00:10:25.999 --> 00:10:28.867
to leadership at the top.

00:10:28.867 --> 00:10:31.230
But you don't have to be a middle manager to do this.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.931
One young scientist that works in a biotech firm

00:10:34.931 --> 00:10:39.300
used her insight about the missing 33 percent

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.412
to weave financial impact data

00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:44.402
into a project update she did

00:10:44.402 --> 00:10:46.742
and got tremendous positive feedback

00:10:46.742 --> 00:10:49.364
from the managers in the room.

00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:51.614
So we don't want to put 100 percent

00:10:51.614 --> 00:10:55.123
of the responsibility on women's shoulders,

00:10:55.123 --> 00:10:59.443
nor would it be wise to do so, and here's why:

00:10:59.443 --> 00:11:01.209
In order for companies to achieve

00:11:01.209 --> 00:11:03.886
their strategic financial goals,

00:11:03.886 --> 00:11:05.844
executives understand that they have to have

00:11:05.844 --> 00:11:08.600
everyone pulling in the same direction.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.142
In other words, the term we use in business is,

00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:13.801
we have to have strategic alignment.

00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:16.952
And executives know this very well,

00:11:16.952 --> 00:11:19.281
and yet only 37 percent,

00:11:19.281 --> 00:11:21.901
according to a recent Conference Board report,

00:11:21.901 --> 00:11:23.499
believe that they have that

00:11:23.499 --> 00:11:26.222
strategic alignment in place.

00:11:26.222 --> 00:11:29.900
So for 63 percent of organizations,

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.217
achieving their strategic financial goals

00:11:32.217 --> 00:11:33.973
is questionable.

00:11:33.973 --> 00:11:37.156
And if you think about what I've just shared,

00:11:37.156 --> 00:11:40.126
that you have situations where at least 50 percent

00:11:40.126 --> 00:11:41.847
of your middle managers

00:11:41.847 --> 00:11:44.446
haven't received clear messaging

00:11:44.446 --> 00:11:48.230
that they have to become focused on the business,

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.768
where it's headed, and their role in taking it there,

00:11:50.768 --> 00:11:52.860
it's not surprising that that percentage

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.240
of executives who are confident about alignment

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.937
is so low,

00:11:56.937 --> 00:11:59.906
which is why there are other people

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:02.292
who have a role to play in this.

00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:05.757
It's important for directors on boards

00:12:05.757 --> 00:12:08.749
to expect from their executives

00:12:08.749 --> 00:12:11.268
proportional pools of women when they sit down

00:12:11.268 --> 00:12:13.856
once a year for their succession discussions.

00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:16.961
Why? Because if they aren't seeing that,

00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:18.749
it could be a red flag

00:12:18.749 --> 00:12:21.641
that their organization isn't as aligned

00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.149
as it could potentially be.

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:25.645
It's important for CEOs

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:28.469
to also expect these proportional pools,

00:12:28.469 --> 00:12:29.976
and if they hear comments like,

00:12:29.976 --> 00:12:32.519
"Well, she doesn't have
enough business experience,"

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:34.050
ask the question,

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.174
"What are we going to do about that?"

00:12:36.174 --> 00:12:38.323
It's important for H.R. executives

00:12:38.323 --> 00:12:40.955
to make sure that the missing 33 percent

00:12:40.955 --> 00:12:43.116
is appropriately emphasized,

00:12:43.116 --> 00:12:45.219
and it's important for women and men

00:12:45.219 --> 00:12:47.277
who are in management positions

00:12:47.277 --> 00:12:49.420
to examine the mindsets we hold

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.687
about women and men, about careers and success,

00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:54.398
to make sure we are creating a level playing field

00:12:54.398 --> 00:12:56.322
for everybody.

00:12:56.322 --> 00:12:58.245
So let me close with the latest chapter

00:12:58.245 --> 00:13:00.080
in Tonya's story.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.924
Tonya emailed me two months ago,

00:13:01.924 --> 00:13:04.838
and she said that she had been
interviewed for a new position,

00:13:04.838 --> 00:13:06.649
and during the interview, they probed

00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:08.178
about her business acumen

00:13:08.178 --> 00:13:11.407
and her strategic insights into the industry,

00:13:11.407 --> 00:13:13.871
and she said that she was so happy to report

00:13:13.871 --> 00:13:15.829
that now she has a new position

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:18.922
reporting directly to the 
chief information officer

00:13:18.922 --> 00:13:21.138
at her company.

00:13:21.138 --> 00:13:23.714
So for some of you, the missing 33 percent

00:13:23.714 --> 00:13:26.695
is an idea for you to put into action,

00:13:26.695 --> 00:13:28.956
and I hope that for all of you,

00:13:28.956 --> 00:13:32.108
you will see it as an idea worth spreading

00:13:32.108 --> 00:13:34.581
in order to help organizations be more effective,

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:37.157
to help women create careers that soar,

00:13:37.157 --> 00:13:40.761
and to help close the gender gap at the top.

00:13:40.761 --> 00:13:42.584
Thank you.

00:13:42.584 --> 00:13:44.517
(Applause)
