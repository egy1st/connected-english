00:00:00.944 --> 00:00:02.333
Over the past couple of days,

00:00:02.357 --> 00:00:04.134
as I've been preparing for my speech,

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:07.698
I've become more and more nervous
about what I'm going to say

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.841
and about being on the same stage
as all these fascinating people.

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:15.155
Being on the same stage as Al Gore,
who was the first person I ever voted for.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.339
And --

00:00:16.363 --> 00:00:19.976
(Laughter)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.790
So I was getting pretty nervous

00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:24.619
and, you know, I didn't know
that Chris sits on the stage,

00:00:24.643 --> 00:00:26.127
and that's more nerve-racking.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.207
But then I started thinking
about my family.

00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:30.976
I started thinking about my father
and my grandfather

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.063
and my great-grandfather,

00:00:33.087 --> 00:00:34.755
and I realized

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:39.025
that I had all of these Teds
going through my bloodstream --

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:40.447
(Laughter)

00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:43.976
that I had to consider this "my element."

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.377
So, who am I?

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.030
Chris kind of mentioned I started
a company with my husband.

00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:52.473
We have about 125 people internationally.

00:00:52.497 --> 00:00:53.976
If you looked in the book,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.584
you saw this ...

00:00:55.608 --> 00:00:56.877
(Laughter)

00:00:56.901 --> 00:01:00.173
which I really was appalled by.

00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:02.600
(Laughter)

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:05.976
And because I wanted
to impress you all with slides,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.738
since I saw the great presentations
yesterday with graphs,

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:11.080
I made a graph that moves,

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.976
and I talk about the makeup of me.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.346
(Laughter)

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.423
So, besides this freakish thing,

00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:20.699
this is my science slide.

00:01:20.723 --> 00:01:23.291
This is math, and this is science,
this is genetics.

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:26.187
This is my grandmother,
and this is where I get this mouth.

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.159
(Laughter)

00:01:28.183 --> 00:01:29.439
So --

00:01:30.163 --> 00:01:34.219
I'm a blogger, which, probably,
to a lot of you, means different things.

00:01:34.243 --> 00:01:38.295
You may have heard
about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha,

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.303
where a blogger talked about how you hack

00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:42.976
or break into a Kryptonite
lock using a ballpoint pen,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.349
and it spread all over.

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:46.339
Kryptonite had to adjust the lock,

00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:49.976
and they had to address it
to avoid too many customer concerns.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.975
You may have heard about Rathergate,

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.106
which was basically the result of bloggers

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.150
realizing that the "th" in 111

00:01:59.174 --> 00:02:02.347
is not typeset on an old typewriter;

00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:03.647
it's on Word.

00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:05.384
Bloggers exposed this,

00:02:05.408 --> 00:02:07.976
or they worked hard to expose this.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.567
You know, blogs are scary.
This is what you see.

00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:16.064
I see this, and I'm sure scared --
I swear on stage -- shitless about blogs,

00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:19.072
because this is not
something that's friendly.

00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:22.722
But there are blogs that are changing
the way we read news

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.143
and consume media,
and these are great examples.

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:27.452
These people are reaching thousands,

00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:29.322
if not millions, of readers,

00:02:29.346 --> 00:02:30.976
and that's incredibly important.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.976
During the hurricane,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.314
you had MSNBC posting
about the hurricane on their blog,

00:02:36.338 --> 00:02:37.680
updating it frequently.

00:02:37.704 --> 00:02:40.976
This was possible because of the easy
nature of blogging tools.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.715
You have my friend,

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.274
who has a blog on PVRs,
personal recorders.

00:02:47.298 --> 00:02:49.568
He makes enough money just by running ads,

00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:51.409
to support his family up in Oregon.

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:52.584
That's all he does now,

00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:55.050
and this is something
that blogs have made possible.

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:57.858
And then you have something
like this, which is Interplast.

00:02:57.882 --> 00:02:59.460
It's a wonderful organization

00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:03.669
of people and doctors
who go to developing nations

00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:05.976
to offer plastic surgery
to those who need it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.662
Children with cleft palates get it,
and they document their story.

00:03:09.686 --> 00:03:10.976
This is wonderful.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.976
I am not that caring.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.727
(Laughter)

00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:17.927
I talk about myself.

00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:19.544
That's what I am. I'm a blogger.

00:03:19.568 --> 00:03:23.097
I have always decided that I was going
to be an expert on one thing,

00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:25.351
and I am an expert on this person,

00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:27.540
and so I write about it.

00:03:27.842 --> 00:03:29.485
So, the short story about my blog:

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.660
it started in 2001, I was 23.

00:03:31.684 --> 00:03:33.408
I wasn't happy with my job,

00:03:33.432 --> 00:03:34.884
because I was a designer,

00:03:34.908 --> 00:03:36.828
but I wasn't being really stimulated.

00:03:36.852 --> 00:03:38.485
I was an English major in college.

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.184
I didn't have any use for it,
but I missed writing.

00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:42.842
So, I started to write a blog

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:45.739
and I started to create things
like these little stories.

00:03:45.763 --> 00:03:49.976
This was an illustration about my camp
experience when I was 11 years old,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.976
and how I went to a YMCA camp,
Christian camp,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.616
and basically by the end,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.520
I had made my friends hate me so much
that I hid in a bunk,

00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:01.800
They couldn't find me,
they sent a search party,

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:04.801
and I overheard people saying
they wish I had killed myself --

00:04:04.825 --> 00:04:06.667
jumped off Bible Peak.

00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:08.336
You can laugh, this is OK.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.752
(Laughter)

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:11.976
This is me.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.469
This is what happened to me.

00:04:13.493 --> 00:04:16.976
And when I started my blog,
it was really this one goal --

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.696
I said, "I am not going
to be famous to the world,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.174
but I could be famous
to people on the Internet."

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:26.358
And I set a goal.

00:04:26.382 --> 00:04:28.768
I said, "I'm going to win an award,"

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:31.210
because I had never won
an award in my entire life.

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:35.165
And I said, "I'm going to win
the South by Southwest Weblog award."

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:37.976
And I won it -- I reached
all of these people,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.487
and I had tens of thousands of people
reading about my life every day.

00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:43.938
And then I wrote a post about a banjo.

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.057
I wrote a post

00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:48.637
about wanting to buy a banjo --

00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:51.113
a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.

00:04:51.613 --> 00:04:53.296
And I don't play instruments;

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.491
I don't know anything about music.

00:04:55.515 --> 00:04:57.976
I like music, and I like banjos,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.380
and I think I probably heard
Steve Martin playing,

00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:01.976
and I said, "I could do that."

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.293
And I said to my husband,

00:05:03.317 --> 00:05:05.507
"Ben, can I buy a banjo?"
And he's like, "No."

00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:06.762
And my husband --

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:07.948
(Laughter)

00:05:07.972 --> 00:05:10.016
this is my husband, who is very hot --

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.976
he won an award for being hot.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.648
(Laughter)

00:05:14.672 --> 00:05:16.537
He told me,

00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:17.976
"You cannot buy a banjo.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.175
You're just like your dad,"
who collects instruments.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.072
And I wrote a post
about how I was so mad at him,

00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:27.945
he was such a tyrant --
he would not let me buy this banjo.

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.331
And those people who know me
understood my joke --

00:05:30.355 --> 00:05:32.704
this is Mena, this is how
I make a joke at people.

00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:35.976
Because the joke in this
is that this person is not a tyrant,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.976
this person is so loving and so sweet

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.789
that he lets me dress him up

00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:42.903
and post pictures of him to my blog.

00:05:42.927 --> 00:05:46.750
(Laughter)

00:05:46.774 --> 00:05:50.100
And if he knew I was showing
this right now -- I put this in today --

00:05:50.124 --> 00:05:51.957
he would kill me.

00:05:51.981 --> 00:05:54.301
But the thing was, my friends read it,

00:05:54.325 --> 00:05:56.752
and they're like, "Oh, that Mena,
she wrote a post

00:05:56.776 --> 00:05:59.244
about wanting a stupid thing
and being stupid."

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:01.724
But I got emails from people that said,

00:06:01.748 --> 00:06:04.811
"Oh my God, your husband
is such an asshole.

00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:07.646
How much money does
he spend on beer in a year?

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.662
You could take that money
and buy your banjo.

00:06:10.686 --> 00:06:12.551
Why don't you open a separate account?"

00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:16.127
I've been with him since I was 17,
we've never had a separate bank account.

00:06:16.151 --> 00:06:18.032
They said, "Separate your bank account.

00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:20.239
Spend your money;
spend his money, that's it."

00:06:20.263 --> 00:06:22.392
And then I got people saying, "Leave him."

00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:23.563
(Laughter)

00:06:23.587 --> 00:06:26.438
I was like, "OK, what?
Who are these people?

00:06:26.462 --> 00:06:27.976
And why are they reading this?"

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.385
And I realized: I don't
want to reach these people.

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:32.976
I don't want to write
for this public audience.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.976
And I started to kill my blog slowly.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.102
I'm like, I don't want
to write this anymore.

00:06:37.126 --> 00:06:38.746
Slowly and slowly --

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.758
And I did tell personal
stories from time to time.

00:06:41.782 --> 00:06:44.694
I wrote this one, and I put this
up because of Einstein today.

00:06:44.718 --> 00:06:47.397
I'm going to get choked up,
because this is my first pet,

00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:49.049
and she passed away two years ago.

00:06:49.073 --> 00:06:52.531
And I decided to break from, "I don't
really write about my public life,"

00:06:52.555 --> 00:06:54.761
because I wanted to give her
a little memorial.

00:06:54.785 --> 00:06:57.276
But anyways, it's these sorts
of personal stories --

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.091
You know, you read the blogs
about politics or about media,

00:07:00.115 --> 00:07:01.645
and gossip and all these things.

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:02.827
These are out there,

00:07:02.851 --> 00:07:05.976
but it's more of the personal
that interests me,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.268
and this is who I am.

00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:10.845
You see Norman Rockwell,
and you have art critics say,

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:12.296
"Norman Rockwell is not art.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.452
Norman Rockwell hangs
in living rooms and bathrooms,

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:18.976
and this is not something
to be considered high art."

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.783
And I think this is one
of the most important things

00:07:21.807 --> 00:07:24.045
to us as humans.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.667
These things resonate with us,

00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:29.715
and, if you think about blogs,
you think of high art blogs,

00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:33.705
the history paintings about,
you know, all the biblical stories,

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:34.880
and then you have this.

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:38.596
These are the blogs that interest me:
the people that just tell stories.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.564
One story is about this baby,
and his name is Odin.

00:07:42.588 --> 00:07:44.770
His father was a blogger.

00:07:44.794 --> 00:07:47.664
And he was writing his blog one day,

00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:50.289
and his wife gave birth to her baby

00:07:50.313 --> 00:07:51.976
at 25 weeks.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.749
And he never expected this.

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:56.976
One day, it was normal;
the next day, it was hell.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.774
And this is a one-pound baby.

00:07:58.798 --> 00:08:01.976
So Odin was documented every single day.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.672
Pictures were taken every day:
day one, day two ...

00:08:04.696 --> 00:08:07.585
You have day nine --
they're talking about his apnea;

00:08:07.609 --> 00:08:09.466
day 39 -- he gets pneumonia.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.976
His baby is so small,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.357
and I've never encountered such a --

00:08:14.381 --> 00:08:17.976
just -- a disturbing image,
but just so heartfelt.

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:21.782
And you're reading this as it happens,

00:08:21.806 --> 00:08:25.911
so on day 55, everybody reads
that he's having failures:

00:08:25.935 --> 00:08:27.789
breathing failures and heart failures,

00:08:27.813 --> 00:08:30.976
and it's slowing down,
and you don't know what to expect.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.212
But then it gets better.
Day 96, he goes home.

00:08:34.236 --> 00:08:36.322
And you see this post.

00:08:36.346 --> 00:08:39.376
That's not something you're going
to see in a paper or magazine

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.354
but this is something this person feels,

00:08:41.378 --> 00:08:43.759
and people are excited
about it -- 28 comments.

00:08:43.783 --> 00:08:45.846
That's not a huge amount
of people reading,

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.640
but 28 people matter.

00:08:47.664 --> 00:08:50.575
And today, he is a healthy baby,

00:08:50.599 --> 00:08:52.734
who, if you read his blog --

00:08:52.758 --> 00:08:55.813
it's snowdeal.org, his father's blog --

00:08:55.837 --> 00:08:59.000
he is taking pictures of him still,
because he is still his son

00:08:59.024 --> 00:09:01.976
and he is, I think,
at his age level right now

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.754
because he had received such
great treatment from the hospital.

00:09:06.317 --> 00:09:07.858
So, blogs.

00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:10.429
So what? You've probably
heard these things before.

00:09:10.453 --> 00:09:14.096
We talked about the WELL,
and about all these sorts of things

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.976
throughout our online history.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.638
But I think blogs are basically
just an evolution,

00:09:19.662 --> 00:09:21.305
and that's where we are today.

00:09:21.329 --> 00:09:23.925
It's this record
of who you are, your persona.

00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:27.014
You have your Google search,
where you say, "What is Mena Trott?"

00:09:27.038 --> 00:09:30.784
And then you find these things
and you're happy or unhappy.

00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:32.976
But then you also find people's blogs,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.898
and those are the records of people
that are writing daily --

00:09:35.922 --> 00:09:39.842
not necessarily about the same topic,
but things that interest them.

00:09:39.866 --> 00:09:43.612
And we talk about the world
flattens, being in this panel,

00:09:43.636 --> 00:09:46.733
and I am very optimistic --
whenever I think about blogs,

00:09:46.757 --> 00:09:49.015
I'm like, "We've got to reach
all these people."

00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:51.118
Hundreds of millions
and billions of people.

00:09:51.142 --> 00:09:53.288
We're getting into China,
we want to be there,

00:09:53.312 --> 00:09:57.013
but there are so many people that
won't have the access to write a blog.

00:09:57.037 --> 00:09:59.774
But to see something
like the $100 computer is amazing,

00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:01.848
because blogging software is simple.

00:10:01.872 --> 00:10:04.115
We have a successful company
because of timing,

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:06.647
and because of perseverance,
but it's simple stuff --

00:10:06.671 --> 00:10:08.182
it's not rocket science.

00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:11.206
And so, that's an amazing
thing to consider.

00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:13.035
So --

00:10:14.294 --> 00:10:19.163
the life record of a blog is something
that I find incredibly important.

00:10:19.187 --> 00:10:21.484
And we started with a slide of my Teds,

00:10:21.508 --> 00:10:23.166
and I had to add this slide,

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.560
because I knew the minute
I showed this, my mom --

00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:28.126
my mom will see this,
because she does read my blog

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.638
and she'll say, "Why wasn't there
a picture of me?"

00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:31.879
This is my mom.

00:10:31.903 --> 00:10:34.173
So, I have all the people that I know of.

00:10:34.197 --> 00:10:38.123
But this is basically the extent
of the family that I know

00:10:38.147 --> 00:10:41.031
in terms of my direct line.

00:10:41.055 --> 00:10:45.138
I showed a Norman Rockwell painting
before, and this one, I grew up with,

00:10:45.162 --> 00:10:46.976
looking at constantly.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.196
I would spend hours
looking at the connections,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.976
saying, "Oh, the little kid
up at the top has red hair;

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.976
so does that first generation up there."

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.642
And it's just these little things.

00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:59.593
This is not science,
but this was enough for me

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:02.976
to be really interested
in how we have evolved

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.274
and how we can trace our line.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.976
So that has always influenced me.

00:11:08.285 --> 00:11:11.897
I have this record, this 1910 census,

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:14.428
of another Grabowski --
that's my maiden name --

00:11:14.452 --> 00:11:17.189
and there's a Theodore,
because there's always a Theodore.

00:11:17.213 --> 00:11:20.845
This is all I have,
a couple of facts about somebody.

00:11:20.869 --> 00:11:25.010
I have their date of birth, their age,
what they did in their household,

00:11:25.034 --> 00:11:26.185
if they spoke English,

00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:28.548
and that's it, that's all I know
of these people.

00:11:28.572 --> 00:11:29.976
And it's pretty sad,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.643
because I only go back
five generations, and that's it.

00:11:33.667 --> 00:11:35.934
I don't even know what happens
on my mom's side,

00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.901
because she's from Cuba
and I don't have that many things.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.305
Just doing this,
I spent time in the archives --

00:11:42.329 --> 00:11:43.973
that's why my husband's a saint --

00:11:43.997 --> 00:11:45.925
I spent time in the Washington archives,

00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:48.054
just sitting there,
looking for these things.

00:11:48.078 --> 00:11:50.058
Now it's online, but he sat through that.

00:11:50.082 --> 00:11:52.573
And so you have this record and --

00:11:52.597 --> 00:11:54.685
This is my great-great-grandmother.

00:11:54.709 --> 00:11:56.336
This is the only picture I have.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.623
And to think of what we have the ability
to do with our blogs;

00:12:00.647 --> 00:12:03.976
to think about the people
that are on those $100 computers,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.641
talking about who they are,
sharing these personal stories --

00:12:07.665 --> 00:12:09.379
this is an amazing thing.

00:12:09.784 --> 00:12:12.976
Another photo that has
greatly influenced me,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.976
or a series of photos, is this project

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.273
that's done by an Argentinean
man and his wife.

00:12:18.297 --> 00:12:21.471
And he's basically taking a picture
of his family every day

00:12:21.495 --> 00:12:27.263
for the past, what is '76? -- 20 ...
Oh my God, I'm '77 -- 29 years?

00:12:27.287 --> 00:12:29.008
Twenty-nine years.

00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:33.425
There was a joke, originally,
about my graph that I left out, which is:

00:12:33.449 --> 00:12:34.606
You see all this math?

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.805
I'm just happy I was able
to add it up to 100,

00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:38.624
because that's my skill set.

00:12:38.648 --> 00:12:40.862
(Laughter)

00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:43.547
So you have these people aging,

00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:46.877
and now this is them today, or last year.

00:12:47.205 --> 00:12:50.150
And that's a powerful thing
to have, to be able to track this.

00:12:50.174 --> 00:12:52.976
I wish that I would have
this of my family.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.976
I know that one day my children
will be wondering --

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.239
or my grandchildren,
or my great-grandchildren,

00:12:59.263 --> 00:13:01.337
if I ever have children --

00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:03.976
what I am going to --

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.287
who I was.

00:13:05.311 --> 00:13:07.562
So I do something
that's very narcissistic --

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:09.078
I am a blogger --

00:13:09.102 --> 00:13:11.562
that is an amazing thing for me,

00:13:11.586 --> 00:13:14.561
because it captures
a moment in time every day.

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:17.845
I take a picture of myself --
I've been doing this since last year --

00:13:17.869 --> 00:13:19.174
every single day.

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:21.024
And, you know, it's the same picture;

00:13:21.048 --> 00:13:22.805
it's basically the same person.

00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:24.408
Only a couple of people read it.

00:13:24.432 --> 00:13:26.285
I don't write this for this audience;

00:13:26.309 --> 00:13:30.316
I'm showing it now, but I would go
insane if this was really public.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.031
About four people probably read it,

00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:34.403
and they tell me, "You haven't updated."

00:13:34.427 --> 00:13:37.387
I'm probably going to get people
telling me I haven't updated.

00:13:37.411 --> 00:13:40.976
But this is amazing, because I can
go back to a day -- to April 2005,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.672
and say, what was I doing this day?

00:13:42.696 --> 00:13:44.096
I look at it, I know exactly.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.116
It's this visual cue
that is so important to what we do.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.239
I put the bad pictures up too,

00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:51.669
because there are bad pictures.

00:13:51.693 --> 00:13:52.859
(Laughter)

00:13:52.883 --> 00:13:56.543
And I remember instantly:
I am in Germany in this --

00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:58.067
I had to go for a one-day trip.

00:13:58.091 --> 00:14:00.755
I was sick, and I was in a hotel room,

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:02.555
and I wanted not to be there.

00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:05.506
And so you see these things,
it's not just always smiling.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.843
Now I've kind of evolved it,
so I have this look.

00:14:07.867 --> 00:14:10.559
If you look at my driver's license,
I have the same look,

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:13.862
and it's a pretty disturbing thing,

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:16.311
but it's something
that is really important.

00:14:16.724 --> 00:14:22.112
And the last story
I really want to tell is this story,

00:14:22.136 --> 00:14:25.409
because this is probably the one
that means the most to me

00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:26.676
in all of what I'm doing.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.024
I'll probably get choked up,
because I tend to when I talk about this.

00:14:30.048 --> 00:14:32.176
So, this woman, her name was Emma,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.240
and she was a blogger
on our service, TypePad.

00:14:35.264 --> 00:14:38.425
And she was a beta tester,
so she was there right when we opened --

00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:39.976
you know, there was 100 people.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.976
And she wrote about her life
dealing with cancer.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.136
She was writing and writing,
and we all started reading it,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.227
because we had
so few blogs on the service,

00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:49.862
we could keep track of everyone.

00:14:49.886 --> 00:14:51.857
And she was writing one day,

00:14:51.881 --> 00:14:54.135
and then she disappeared for a little bit.

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:58.574
And her sister came on, and she said
that Emma had passed away.

00:14:58.598 --> 00:15:03.458
And all of our support staff who had
talked to her were really emotional,

00:15:03.482 --> 00:15:06.641
and it was a very hard day at the company.

00:15:06.665 --> 00:15:09.976
And this was one of those
instances where I realized

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.708
how much blogging
affects our relationship,

00:15:12.732 --> 00:15:14.394
and flattening this sort of world.

00:15:14.418 --> 00:15:16.102
That this woman is in England,

00:15:16.126 --> 00:15:19.363
and she lives -- she lived -- a life

00:15:19.387 --> 00:15:22.649
where she was talking
about what she was doing.

00:15:22.673 --> 00:15:26.202
But the big thing
that really influenced us was,

00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:28.112
her sister wrote to me, and she said --

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:29.540
and she wrote on this blog --

00:15:29.564 --> 00:15:32.800
that writing her blog during
the last couple of months of her life

00:15:32.824 --> 00:15:35.317
was probably the best thing
that had happened to her,

00:15:35.341 --> 00:15:38.409
and being able to talk to people
and to share what was going on,

00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:41.322
and being able to write
and receive comments.

00:15:41.346 --> 00:15:42.514
And that was amazing,

00:15:42.538 --> 00:15:44.800
to be able to know
that we had empowered that,

00:15:44.824 --> 00:15:48.004
and that blogging was something
that she felt comfortable doing,

00:15:48.028 --> 00:15:51.163
and the idea that blogging
doesn't have to be scary,

00:15:51.187 --> 00:15:53.670
that we don't always have
to be attack of the blogs,

00:15:53.694 --> 00:15:57.377
that we can be people who are open,
and wanting to help and talk to people.

00:15:57.401 --> 00:15:58.976
That was an amazing thing.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.487
And so I printed out and sent
a PDF of her blog to her family,

00:16:04.511 --> 00:16:06.710
and they passed it
out at her memorial service,

00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:09.096
and even in her obituary,
they mentioned her blog,

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.129
because it was such
a big part of her life.

00:16:11.153 --> 00:16:12.390
And that's a huge thing.

00:16:12.414 --> 00:16:15.379
So, this is her legacy,

00:16:15.403 --> 00:16:18.699
and I think that my call to action
to all of you is:

00:16:18.723 --> 00:16:20.880
think about blogs,
think about what they are,

00:16:20.904 --> 00:16:22.832
think about what you've thought of them,

00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:24.021
and then actually do it,

00:16:24.045 --> 00:16:27.043
because it's something
that's really going to change our lives.

00:16:27.067 --> 00:16:28.229
So, thank you.

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:29.253
(Applause)
