00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I show a number of photographs and films,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but I also make television programs, books and some advertising,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
all with the same concept.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and the importance of the image:

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
celebrity is born of photography.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when Princess Diana died.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There was a sort of a standstill in Britain

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the moment of her death,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I was fascinated by this phenomenon,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so I wondered:

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
could one erase the image of Diana, actually quite crudely and physically?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but I couldn't erase this from my memory

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Momentum was being built.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The press wrote about her death in rather, I felt, pornographic ways --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
like, "Which bit of artery left which bit of body?"

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and "How did she die in the back of the car?" --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so I made these rather gory images.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
so I got a look-alike of Diana

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and posed her in the right positions and angles

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and created something that was in, or existed in, the public imagination.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So people were wondering: was she going to marry Dodi?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Was she in love with him?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Was she pregnant? Did she want his baby?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Was she pregnant when she died?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So I created this image of Diana, Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and this image came out, which caused a huge public outcry at the time.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
so I started making reference to media imagery --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
made it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
to titillate the public or the viewer further

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and this was a sequence of images.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And this gets shown in art galleries like this, as a sequence.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And similarly with the Di-Dodian baby imagery --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
this is another art gallery installation.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but you think it's Camilla and the Queen,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And the camera can lie,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and it makes it very, very easy

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So, I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And at the same time, it removes us from the real subject matter,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and this acts as a sort of titillating thing.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
what you can't have, you want more.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
In the photograph, the real subject doesn't exist

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
so it makes you want that person more.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the more pictures you see of these celebrities,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
the more you feel you know them,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
but you don't know them

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and you want to know them further.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Of course, the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
watch her horses. (Laughter).

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And then I was sort of making imagery.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
In England there's an expression: "you can't imagine the Queen on the loo."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So I'm trying to penetrate that.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Well, here is the image.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and I was cited as a disgusting artist. The press were writing about this,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
giving full pages about how terrible this was.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle:

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I was making comments about the press

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and about how we know facts and information only by media --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
because we don't know the real people;

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
very few of us know the real people --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
but it was going back into the press

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So, these are broadsheets, tabloids, debates were being had all about this work,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
politicians were getting involved --

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
all sorts of things -- great headlines.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Then suddenly, it started to get on front pages.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I was being asked and paid to do front covers.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
which I found also fascinating.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
How one moment -- it was disgusting --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
saying my work was wonderful,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But then this changed suddenly.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I then started to work for magazines and newspapers.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
This was, for example, an image that went into Tatler.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
This was another newspaper image.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It was an April fool actually, and to this day some people think it's real.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
sitting outside William Hill.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
They thought it was real.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I was exploring, at the time, the hyperbole of icons --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and Diana and Marilyn -- and the importance of celebrity in our lives.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
without us even knowing,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and how that should happen.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
There's me as Diana --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley, I think, in this one. (Laughter).

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And me as the Queen.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn --

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
the biggest icon of all --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and only showing certain angles to create a reality that, obviously,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
is completely constructed.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
This is the look-alike, so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
She looks nothing like Marilyn,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
she looks exactly like Marilyn,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
or recognize this look-alike -- in these photographs,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
which I find quite interesting.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So, all this work is getting shown in art galleries.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Then I made a book.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Stills from the TV series went into this book.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
But there was a real legal problem because it looks real,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
but how do you get over that?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Because obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now:

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that we can't tell what's real.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So, from my point of view, it's important to publish it,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
but at the same time it does cause a confusion --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
intentional on my behalf,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
but problematic for any outlet that I'm working with.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and comments about our public figures.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:43.000
You know, what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, the links that were put about pre-Iraq war.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And what is going to happen to the monarchy?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Because obviously the British public,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I think, would prefer William to Charles on the throne.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And it's that wish, or that desire, that I suppose I'm dealing with in my work.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I'm interested in the perception of the celebrity.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And with some look-alikes, they are so good

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
you don't know whether they're real or not.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes, which is Coca-Cola,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It's highly commercial.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
But it was a difficulty for me -- because this is my artwork;

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
should I do advertising? -- at the time.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and that the integrity of the work remained the same.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and that's all you're doing.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
When you take the logo off, you're opening up the interpretations

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and making the work inconclusive,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
opposed to conclusive when you are advertising.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
This image is quite interesting, actually,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
because I think we made it three years ago.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And it's Camilla in her wedding dress, which, again,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
nearly got re-used now, recently prior to her wedding.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Tony Blair and Cherie. And again, the legalities -- we had to be very careful.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
It's obviously a very big commercial company, and so this little,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
"Shh -- it's not really them,"

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
was put on the side of the imagery.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000
so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
live scenes with look-alikes inside the windows,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and the windows were all steamed up.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So, it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech;

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin;

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson, who he was having an affair with at that time.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
This was a huge success for them

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
because the imagery got shown in the press the day after

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
in every single newspaper, broadsheets and tabloids.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
It was a bit of a road stopper, which was problematic

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Also, people were taking photographs of this,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly, all this imagery.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And the press were interviewing, and I was signing my book. (Laughter).

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Further imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschen

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
that I'm working on really for a sort of global market --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
my previous book was only for the U.K. market --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
that I suppose it could be called humorous.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I suppose I come from a sort of non-humorous background

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
with serious intent,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and then suddenly my work is funny.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way;

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and how we read all our information through imagery.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
It's an extremely fast way of getting information.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
This image, for example, is sort of spot-on

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein, and George Bush

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
reading the Koran upside-down.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
For example, George Bush target practice --

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
shooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And then you change the photograph he's shooting at,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible. (Laughter).

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Tony Blair being used as a mounting block,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and the seriousness, or the intellect, of Bush.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And also, commenting on the behind the scenes --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
well, as we know now -- what goes on in prisons.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And in fact, George Bush and Tony Blair

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
are having great fun during all of this.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And really commenting, you know,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
based on the perception we have of the celebrities.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and golf-clubbed a driver the other day.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I mean, it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
so I'm constantly going up to people in the street

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and trying to ask people to come

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and be in one of my photographs or films.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And sometimes asking the real celebrity,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
which is highly embarrassing. (Laughter).

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I've also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis --

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
a page a week in their newspaper --

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
which has been very interesting, working topically.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So, Jamie Oliver and school dinners;

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture;

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
the whole of the hunting issue,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and the royal family refusing to stop hunting;

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and the tsunami issues; and obviously Harry;

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Blair's views on Gordon Brown, which I find very interesting;

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Condi and Bush.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I made it a year ago. And just how meanings change,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and there were a terrible thing that has happened,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
That's why this image was made one year ago,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and what it means today.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000
So, I'll leave you with these clips to have a look. (Music)

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
