00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.521
Recently, I flew over a crowd

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:09.906
of thousands of people in Brazil

00:00:09.906 --> 00:00:13.539
playing music by George Frideric Handel.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.543
I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam,

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:19.918
again playing music by this same composer.

00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:22.685
Let's take a look.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:31.265
(Music: George Frideric Handel, "Allegro."
Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)

00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:43.960
(Video) Daria van den Bercken: I
live there on the third floor.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.849
(In Dutch) I live there on the corner.

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:47.457
I actually live there, around the corner.

00:00:47.457 --> 00:00:49.133
and you'd be really welcome.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.952
Man: (In Dutch) Does that sound like fun?
Child: (In Dutch) Yes!

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:55.739
[(In Dutch) "Handel house concert"]

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:22.636
(Applause)

00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:30.154
Daria van den Bercken: All this was a real

00:01:30.154 --> 00:01:33.810
magical experience for hundreds of reasons.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.330
Now you may ask, why have I done these things?

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.692
They're not really typical for a musician's

00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:40.913
day-to-day life.

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:44.463
Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music

00:01:44.463 --> 00:01:47.545
and I wanted to share it with as many people

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:49.829
as possible.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.944
It started a couple of years ago.

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:55.375
I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:57.497
and browsing the Internet a little,

00:01:57.497 --> 00:02:00.320
when I found out that Handel had written works

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.320
for the keyboard.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.637
Well, I was surprised. I did not know this.

00:02:04.637 --> 00:02:09.020
So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.920
And what happened next was

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.491
that I entered this state of pure,

00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:17.360
unprejudiced amazement.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.700
It was an experience

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.827
of being totally in awe of the music,

00:02:22.827 --> 00:02:26.607
and I had not felt that in a long time.

00:02:26.607 --> 00:02:30.760
It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.051
The first piece that I played through

00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:36.840
started like this.

00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:43.792
(Music)

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.680
Well this sounds very melancholic, doesn't it?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.714
And I turned the page and what came next

00:03:09.714 --> 00:03:11.672
was this.

00:03:11.672 --> 00:03:15.392
(Music)

00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:42.690
Well, this sounds very energetic, doesn't it?

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.390
So within a couple of minutes,

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.550
and the piece isn't even finished yet,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.645
I experienced two very contrasting characters:

00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:55.267
beautiful melancholy and sheer energy.

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:57.337
And I consider these two elements to be

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:00.140
vital human expressions.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.815
And the purity of the music makes you hear it

00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:06.247
very effectively.

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:10.233
I've given a lot of children's concerts

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:13.371
for children of seven and eight years old,

00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:17.185
and whatever I play, whether it's Bach, Beethoven,

00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:18.760
even Stockhausen,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.752
or some jazzy music,

00:04:21.752 --> 00:04:23.901
they are open to hear it,

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:25.188
really willing to listen,

00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:28.716
and they are comfortable doing so.

00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:30.250
And when classes come in

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.699
with children who are just a few years older,

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.547
11, 12, I felt that I sometimes already had trouble

00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:40.640
in reaching them like that.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.307
The complexity of the music does become an issue,

00:04:44.307 --> 00:04:48.140
and actually the opinions of others —

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.823
parents, friends, media — they start to count.

00:04:52.823 --> 00:04:55.331
But the young ones, they don't question

00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:58.672
their own opinion.

00:04:58.672 --> 00:05:01.664
They are in this constant state of wonder,

00:05:01.664 --> 00:05:05.354
and I do firmly believe that we can keep listening

00:05:05.354 --> 00:05:07.638
like these seven-year-old children,

00:05:07.638 --> 00:05:10.112
even when growing up.

00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:12.261
And that is why I have played

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:14.601
not only in the concert hall

00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:18.930
but also on the street, online, in the air:

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.497
to feel that state of wonder,

00:05:21.497 --> 00:05:23.679
to truly listen,

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:27.223
and to listen without prejudice.

00:05:27.223 --> 00:05:29.349
And I would like to invite you

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.382
to do so now.

00:05:38.862 --> 00:05:45.830
(Music: George Frideric Handel, "Chaconne in G Major."
Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)

00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:11.960
(Applause)

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.906
Thank you.

00:09:13.906 --> 00:09:17.400
(Applause)
