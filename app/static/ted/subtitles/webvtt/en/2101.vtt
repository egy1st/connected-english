00:00:00.915 --> 00:00:02.880
It's very nice to be here tonight.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.596
So I've been working on the history of income

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:09.915
and wealth distribution for the past 15 years,

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:13.016
and one of the interesting lessons

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:15.517
coming from this historical evidence

00:00:15.517 --> 00:00:17.530
is indeed that, in the long run,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.250
there is a tendency for 
the rate of return of capital

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.920
to exceed the economy's growth rate,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.665
and this tends to lead to 
high concentration of wealth.

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:28.498
Not infinite concentration of wealth,

00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:31.289
but the higher the gap between r and g,

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.224
the higher the level of inequality of wealth

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:37.431
towards which society tends to converge.

00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:40.985
So this is a key force that
I'm going to talk about today,

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:42.954
but let me say right away

00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:45.284
that this is not the only important force

00:00:45.284 --> 00:00:47.757
in the dynamics of income 
and wealth distribution,

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:49.782
and there are many other forces that play

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:52.763
an important role in the long-run dynamics

00:00:52.763 --> 00:00:54.338
of income and wealth distribution.

00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:56.307
Also there is a lot of data

00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:57.863
that still needs to be collected.

00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:00.795
We know a little bit more today

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:03.316
than we used to know, 
but we still know too little,

00:01:03.316 --> 00:01:05.992
and certainly there are 
many different processes —

00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:08.290
economic, social, political —

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.717
that need to be studied more.

00:01:09.717 --> 00:01:12.697
And so I'm going to focus today on this simple force,

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.958
but that doesn't mean that other important forces

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.162
do not exist.

00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:18.434
So most of the data I'm going to present

00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:20.639
comes from this database

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:21.899
that's available online:

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.384
the World Top Incomes Database.

00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:25.487
So this is the largest existing

00:01:25.487 --> 00:01:27.940
historical database on inequality,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.290
and this comes from the effort

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.182
of over 30 scholars from several dozen countries.

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:35.960
So let me show you a couple of facts

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.105
coming from this database,

00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:39.179
and then we'll return to r bigger than g.

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.689
So fact number one is that there has been

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.740
a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.645
between the United States and Europe

00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:48.400
over the past century.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.905
So back in 1900, 1910, income inequality was actually

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:54.170
much higher in Europe than in the United States,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.280
whereas today, it is a lot higher in the United States.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.946
So let me be very clear:

00:01:58.946 --> 00:02:01.770
The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.267
It has more to do with changing supply and demand

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:08.720
for skill, the race between education and technology,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.300
globalization, probably more unequal access

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.906
to skills in the U.S.,

00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:16.493
where you have very good, very top universities

00:02:16.493 --> 00:02:18.735
but where the bottom part of the educational system

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:19.500
is not as good,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.861
so very unequal access to skills,

00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:23.780
and also an unprecedented rise

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.800
of top managerial compensation of the United States,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.650
which is difficult to account for
just on the basis of education.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.604
So there is more going on here,

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:34.213
but I'm not going to talk too much about this today,

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:36.879
because I want to focus on wealth inequality.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.860
So let me just show you a very simple indicator

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.210
about the income inequality part.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.664
So this is the share of total income

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.452
going to the top 10 percent.

00:02:46.452 --> 00:02:48.624
So you can see that one century ago,

00:02:48.624 --> 00:02:52.201
it was between 45 and 50 percent in Europe

00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:54.939
and a little bit above 40 percent in the U.S.,

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.210
so there was more inequality in Europe.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.234
Then there was a sharp decline

00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:01.765
during the first half of the 20th century,

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.128
and in the recent decade, you can see that

00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:07.630
the U.S. has become more unequal than Europe,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.300
and this is the first fact I just talked about.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.211
Now, the second fact is more about wealth inequality,

00:03:14.211 --> 00:03:17.301
and here the central fact is that wealth inequality

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:19.907
is always a lot higher than income inequality,

00:03:19.907 --> 00:03:22.292
and also that wealth inequality,

00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:24.945
although it has also increased in recent decades,

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:26.801
is still less extreme today

00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:28.680
than what it was a century ago,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.199
although the total quantity of wealth

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.224
relative to income has now recovered

00:03:33.224 --> 00:03:34.855
from the very large shocks

00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:36.880
caused by World War I, the Great Depression,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.099
World War II.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.143
So let me show you two graphs

00:03:40.143 --> 00:03:43.000
illustrating fact number two and fact number three.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.390
So first, if you look at the level of wealth inequality,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.548
this is the share of total wealth

00:03:50.548 --> 00:03:53.070
going to the top 10 percent of wealth holders,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.779
so you can see the same kind of reversal

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:58.344
between the U.S. and Europe that we had before

00:03:58.344 --> 00:04:00.020
for income inequality.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.570
So wealth concentration was higher

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.813
in Europe than in the U.S. a century ago,

00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:07.647
and now it is the opposite.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:09.638
But you can also show two things:

00:04:09.638 --> 00:04:13.339
First, the general level of wealth inequality

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.994
is always higher than income inequality.

00:04:15.994 --> 00:04:18.334
So remember, for income inequality,

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:20.662
the share going to the top 10 percent

00:04:20.662 --> 00:04:24.960
was between 30 and 50 percent of total income,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.772
whereas for wealth, the share is always

00:04:27.772 --> 00:04:29.831
between 60 and 90 percent.

00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.347
Okay, so that's fact number one,

00:04:31.347 --> 00:04:33.273
and that's very important for what follows.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.994
Wealth concentration is always

00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:36.873
a lot higher than income concentration.

00:04:36.873 --> 00:04:40.259
Fact number two is that the rise

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.206
in wealth inequality in recent decades

00:04:43.206 --> 00:04:47.492
is still not enough to get us back to 1910.

00:04:47.492 --> 00:04:49.269
So the big difference today,

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:51.182
wealth inequality is still very large,

00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:54.444
with 60, 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10,

00:04:54.444 --> 00:04:56.289
but the good news is that it's actually

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.070
better than one century ago,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.441
where you had 90 percent in
Europe going to the top 10.

00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:03.432
So today what you have

00:05:03.432 --> 00:05:05.434
is what I call the middle 40 percent,

00:05:05.434 --> 00:05:07.347
the people who are not in the top 10

00:05:07.347 --> 00:05:09.120
and who are not in the bottom 50,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.386
and what you can view as the wealth middle class

00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:14.529
that owns 20 to 30 percent

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.391
of total wealth, national wealth,

00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:19.722
whereas they used to be poor, a century ago,

00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:22.340
when there was basically no wealth middle class.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.917
So this is an important change,

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:28.532
and it's interesting to see that wealth inequality

00:05:28.532 --> 00:05:31.838
has not fully recovered to pre-World War I levels,

00:05:31.838 --> 00:05:35.347
although the total quantity of wealth has recovered.

00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:37.294
Okay? So this is the total value

00:05:37.294 --> 00:05:39.510
of wealth relative to income,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.623
and you can see that in particular in Europe,

00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:45.483
we are almost back to the pre-World War I level.

00:05:45.483 --> 00:05:47.328
So there are really two

00:05:47.328 --> 00:05:49.859
different parts of the story here.

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:50.978
One has to do with

00:05:50.978 --> 00:05:53.420
the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.098
and there is nothing bad per se, of course,

00:05:55.098 --> 00:05:56.845
in accumulating a lot of wealth,

00:05:56.845 --> 00:05:59.713
and in particular if it is more diffuse

00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:01.107
and less concentrated.

00:06:01.107 --> 00:06:03.852
So what we really want to focus on

00:06:03.852 --> 00:06:06.233
is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality,

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.533
and what's going to happen in the future.

00:06:08.533 --> 00:06:10.558
How can we account for the fact that

00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:14.220
until World War I, wealth inequality was so high

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.410
and, if anything, was rising to even higher levels,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.737
and how can we think about the future?

00:06:20.737 --> 00:06:24.623
So let me come to some of the explanations

00:06:24.623 --> 00:06:26.759
and speculations about the future.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.354
Let me first say that

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:30.341
probably the best model to explain

00:06:30.341 --> 00:06:32.438
why wealth is so much

00:06:32.438 --> 00:06:34.624
more concentrated than income

00:06:34.624 --> 00:06:37.736
is a dynamic, dynastic model

00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:40.200
where individuals have a long horizon

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.956
and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons.

00:06:42.956 --> 00:06:45.566
If people were accumulating wealth

00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:47.569
only for life cycle reasons,

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.582
you know, to be able to consume

00:06:49.582 --> 00:06:51.169
when they are old,

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.542
then the level of wealth inequality

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:55.859
should be more or less in line

00:06:55.859 --> 00:06:57.828
with the level of income inequality.

00:06:57.828 --> 00:06:59.756
But it will be very difficult to explain

00:06:59.756 --> 00:07:01.950
why you have so much more wealth inequality

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.434
than income inequality

00:07:03.434 --> 00:07:04.710
with a pure life cycle model,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.741
so you need a story

00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:08.429
where people also care

00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:10.960
about wealth accumulation for other reasons.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.884
So typically, they want to transmit

00:07:12.884 --> 00:07:16.210
wealth to the next generation, to their children,

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.978
or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth

00:07:17.978 --> 00:07:20.746
because of the prestige, the
power that goes with wealth.

00:07:20.746 --> 00:07:22.130
So there must be other reasons

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.120
for accumulating wealth than just life cycle

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.888
to explain what we see in the data.

00:07:26.888 --> 00:07:30.234
Now, in a large class of dynamic models

00:07:30.234 --> 00:07:32.210
of wealth accumulation

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.768
with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth,

00:07:35.768 --> 00:07:38.614
you will have all sorts of random,

00:07:38.614 --> 00:07:39.537
multiplicative shocks.

00:07:39.537 --> 00:07:41.786
So for instance, some families

00:07:41.786 --> 00:07:43.473
have a very large number of children,

00:07:43.473 --> 00:07:45.239
so the wealth will be divided.

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:47.129
Some families have fewer children.

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.357
You also have shocks to rates of return.

00:07:49.357 --> 00:07:51.454
Some families make huge capital gains.

00:07:51.454 --> 00:07:53.249
Some made bad investments.

00:07:53.249 --> 00:07:55.490
So you will always have some mobility

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.928
in the wealth process.

00:07:56.928 --> 00:07:59.303
Some people will move up,
some people will move down.

00:07:59.303 --> 00:08:00.955
The important point is that,

00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:01.965
in any such model,

00:08:01.965 --> 00:08:04.521
for a given variance of such shocks,

00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:06.557
the equilibrium level of wealth inequality

00:08:06.557 --> 00:08:11.394
will be a steeply rising function of r minus g.

00:08:11.394 --> 00:08:14.263
And intuitively, the reason why the difference

00:08:14.263 --> 00:08:16.107
between the rate of return to wealth

00:08:16.107 --> 00:08:17.862
and the growth rate is important

00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:20.174
is that initial wealth inequalities

00:08:20.174 --> 00:08:22.565
will be amplified at a faster pace

00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:24.634
with a bigger r minus g.

00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:26.108
So take a simple example,

00:08:26.108 --> 00:08:29.874
with r equals five percent and g equals one percent,

00:08:29.874 --> 00:08:31.982
wealth holders only need to reinvest

00:08:31.982 --> 00:08:34.621
one fifth of their capital income to ensure

00:08:34.621 --> 00:08:37.354
that their wealth rises as fast

00:08:37.354 --> 00:08:39.267
as the size of the economy.

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:40.650
So this makes it easier

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.416
to build and perpetuate large fortunes

00:08:42.416 --> 00:08:44.371
because you can consume four fifths,

00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:46.110
assuming zero tax,

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.771
and you can just reinvest one fifth.

00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:50.359
So of course some families
will consume more than that,

00:08:50.359 --> 00:08:52.102
some will consume less, so there will be

00:08:52.102 --> 00:08:53.857
some mobility in the distribution,

00:08:53.857 --> 00:08:56.703
but on average, they only need to reinvest one fifth,

00:08:56.703 --> 00:09:00.472
so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained.

00:09:00.472 --> 00:09:02.969
Now, you should not be surprised

00:09:02.969 --> 00:09:06.505
by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever,

00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:08.121
because, in fact, this is what happened

00:09:08.121 --> 00:09:10.192
during most of the history of mankind.

00:09:10.192 --> 00:09:13.543
And this was in a way very obvious to everybody

00:09:13.543 --> 00:09:15.321
for a simple reason, which is that growth

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.509
was close to zero percent

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:19.130
during most of the history of mankind.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.662
Growth was maybe 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 percent,

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.658
but very slow growth of population

00:09:24.658 --> 00:09:26.655
and output per capita,

00:09:26.655 --> 00:09:28.539
whereas the rate of return on capital

00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:30.395
of course was not zero percent.

00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:32.431
It was, for land assets, which was

00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:34.240
the traditional form

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.641
of assets in preindustrial societies,

00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:38.404
it was typically five percent.

00:09:38.404 --> 00:09:42.190
Any reader of Jane Austen would know that.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.098
If you want an annual income of 1,000 pounds,

00:09:45.098 --> 00:09:46.740
you should have a capital value

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.596
of 20,000 pounds so that

00:09:48.596 --> 00:09:51.146
five percent of 20,000 is 1,000.

00:09:51.146 --> 00:09:53.163
And in a way, this was

00:09:53.163 --> 00:09:54.941
the very foundation of society,

00:09:54.941 --> 00:09:57.976
because r bigger than g

00:09:57.976 --> 00:10:02.100
was what allowed holders of wealth and assets

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.790
to live off their capital income

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.490
and to do something else in life

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.685
than just to care about their own survival.

00:10:10.685 --> 00:10:12.845
Now, one important conclusion

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:14.836
of my historical research is that

00:10:14.836 --> 00:10:17.547
modern industrial growth did not change

00:10:17.547 --> 00:10:20.371
this basic fact as much as one might have expected.

00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:22.050
Of course, the growth rate

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.858
following the Industrial Revolution

00:10:23.858 --> 00:10:28.180
rose, typically from zero to one to two percent,

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.110
but at the same time, the rate of return

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.755
to capital also rose

00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:34.180
so that the gap between the two

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.636
did not really change.

00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:37.886
So during the 20th century,

00:10:37.886 --> 00:10:40.530
you had a very unique combination of events.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.547
First, a very low rate of return

00:10:42.547 --> 00:10:45.563
due to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks,

00:10:45.563 --> 00:10:47.868
destruction of wealth, inflation,

00:10:47.868 --> 00:10:49.848
bankruptcy during the Great Depression,

00:10:49.848 --> 00:10:51.513
and all of this reduced

00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:53.263
the private rate of return to wealth

00:10:53.263 --> 00:10:55.158
to unusually low levels

00:10:55.158 --> 00:10:57.497
between 1914 and 1945.

00:10:57.497 --> 00:10:59.333
And then, in the postwar period,

00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:02.570
you had unusually high growth rate,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.944
partly due to the reconstruction.

00:11:04.944 --> 00:11:06.869
You know, in Germany, in France, in Japan,

00:11:06.869 --> 00:11:08.420
you had five percent growth rate

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.570
between 1950 and 1980

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.213
largely due to reconstruction,

00:11:13.213 --> 00:11:15.564
and also due to very large demographic growth,

00:11:15.564 --> 00:11:17.705
the Baby Boom Cohort effect.

00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:20.143
Now, apparently that's not going to last for very long,

00:11:20.143 --> 00:11:21.818
or at least the population growth

00:11:21.818 --> 00:11:24.586
is supposed to decline in the future,

00:11:24.586 --> 00:11:28.242
and the best projections we have is that

00:11:28.242 --> 00:11:30.070
the long-run growth is going to be closer

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.493
to one to two percent

00:11:31.493 --> 00:11:33.439
rather than four to five percent.

00:11:33.439 --> 00:11:36.116
So if you look at this,

00:11:36.116 --> 00:11:38.257
these are the best estimates we have

00:11:38.257 --> 00:11:39.913
of world GDP growth

00:11:39.913 --> 00:11:42.272
and rate of return on capital,

00:11:42.272 --> 00:11:44.360
average rates of return on capital,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.428
so you can see that during most

00:11:45.428 --> 00:11:46.945
of the history of mankind,

00:11:46.945 --> 00:11:48.558
the growth rate was very small,

00:11:48.558 --> 00:11:50.392
much lower than the rate of return,

00:11:50.392 --> 00:11:52.754
and then during the 20th century,

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:54.925
it is really the population growth,

00:11:54.925 --> 00:11:57.197
very high in the postwar period,

00:11:57.197 --> 00:11:58.797
and the reconstruction process

00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:00.370
that brought growth

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.441
to a smaller gap with the rate of return.

00:12:03.441 --> 00:12:06.964
Here I use the United Nations population projections,

00:12:06.964 --> 00:12:09.440
so of course they are uncertain.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.831
It could be that we all start

00:12:10.831 --> 00:12:12.937
having a lot of children in the future,

00:12:12.937 --> 00:12:15.702
and the growth rates are going to be higher,

00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:16.951
but from now on,

00:12:16.951 --> 00:12:19.753
these are the best projections we have,

00:12:19.753 --> 00:12:21.687
and this will make global growth

00:12:21.687 --> 00:12:24.443
decline and the gap between

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:26.446
the rate of return go up.

00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:29.308
Now, the other unusual event

00:12:29.308 --> 00:12:30.979
during the 20th century

00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:32.308
was, as I said,

00:12:32.308 --> 00:12:34.624
destruction, taxation of capital,

00:12:34.624 --> 00:12:37.359
so this is the pre-tax rate of return.

00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:40.338
This is the after-tax rate of return,

00:12:40.338 --> 00:12:41.904
and after destruction,

00:12:41.904 --> 00:12:43.681
and this is what brought

00:12:43.681 --> 00:12:45.369
the average rate of return

00:12:45.369 --> 00:12:47.158
after tax, after destruction,

00:12:47.158 --> 00:12:49.578
below the growth rate during a long time period.

00:12:49.578 --> 00:12:51.252
But without the destruction,

00:12:51.252 --> 00:12:53.727
without the taxation, this 
would not have happened.

00:12:53.727 --> 00:12:56.970
So let me say that the balance between

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.326
returns on capital and growth

00:12:59.326 --> 00:13:01.188
depends on many different factors

00:13:01.188 --> 00:13:03.273
that are very difficult to predict:

00:13:03.273 --> 00:13:05.388
technology and the development

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:07.972
of capital-intensive techniques.

00:13:07.972 --> 00:13:10.991
So right now, the most capital-intensive sectors

00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:14.367
in the economy are the real estate sector, housing,

00:13:14.367 --> 00:13:17.229
the energy sector, but it could be in the future

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:20.941
that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors

00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:22.830
and that this would be a bigger share

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.740
of the total capital stock that it is today.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.734
Well, we are very far from this,

00:13:26.734 --> 00:13:28.500
and from now, what's going on

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.289
in the real estate sector, the energy sector,

00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:32.415
is much more important for the total capital stock

00:13:32.415 --> 00:13:33.549
and capital share.

00:13:33.549 --> 00:13:35.582
The other important issue

00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:37.732
is that there are scale effects
in portfolio management,

00:13:37.732 --> 00:13:40.151
together with financial complexity,

00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:41.601
financial deregulation,

00:13:41.601 --> 00:13:44.310
that make it easier to get higher rates of return

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.937
for a large portfolio,

00:13:45.937 --> 00:13:48.600
and this seems to be particularly strong

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.582
for billionaires, large capital endowments.

00:13:50.582 --> 00:13:52.872
Just to give you one example,

00:13:52.872 --> 00:13:56.205
this comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings

00:13:56.205 --> 00:13:59.535
over the 1987-2013 period,

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:02.323
and you can see the very top wealth holders

00:14:02.323 --> 00:14:05.440
have been going up at six, seven percent per year

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.831
in real terms above inflation,

00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:10.203
whereas average income in the world,

00:14:10.203 --> 00:14:11.566
average wealth in the world,

00:14:11.566 --> 00:14:14.949
have increased at only two percent per year.

00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:16.678
And you find the same

00:14:16.678 --> 00:14:17.954
for large university endowments —

00:14:17.954 --> 00:14:20.222
the bigger the initial endowments,

00:14:20.222 --> 00:14:22.290
the bigger the rate of return.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.968
Now, what could be done?

00:14:23.968 --> 00:14:26.364
The first thing is that I think we need

00:14:26.364 --> 00:14:28.479
more financial transparency.

00:14:28.479 --> 00:14:32.320
We know too little about global wealth dynamics,

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.220
so we need international transmission

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.482
of bank information.

00:14:35.482 --> 00:14:38.168
We need a global registry of financial assets,

00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:40.659
more coordination on wealth taxation,

00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:43.771
and even wealth tax with a small tax rate

00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:45.987
will be a way to produce information

00:14:45.987 --> 00:14:48.669
so that then we can adapt our policies

00:14:48.669 --> 00:14:50.505
to whatever we observe.

00:14:50.505 --> 00:14:52.343
And to some extent, the fight

00:14:52.343 --> 00:14:53.824
against tax havens

00:14:53.824 --> 00:14:55.639
and automatic transmission of information

00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:57.490
is pushing us in this direction.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.814
Now, there are other ways to redistribute wealth,

00:14:59.814 --> 00:15:02.771
which it can be tempting to use.

00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:04.127
Inflation:

00:15:04.127 --> 00:15:05.826
it's much easier to print money

00:15:05.826 --> 00:15:07.981
than to write a tax code, so that's very tempting,

00:15:07.981 --> 00:15:10.101
but sometimes you don't know
what you do with the money.

00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:11.748
This is a problem.

00:15:11.748 --> 00:15:13.611
Expropriation is very tempting.

00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:15.872
Just when you feel some people get too wealthy,

00:15:15.872 --> 00:15:17.166
you just expropriate them.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.878
But this is not a very efficient way

00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:21.711
to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics.

00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:24.190
So war is an even less efficient way,

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.526
so I tend to prefer progressive taxation,

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:29.100
but of course, history — (Laughter) —

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.835
history will invent its own best ways,

00:15:30.835 --> 00:15:32.533
and it will probably involve

00:15:32.533 --> 00:15:34.267
a combination of all of these.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.133
Thank you.

00:15:36.133 --> 00:15:38.270
(Applause)

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:43.829
Bruno Giussani: Thomas Piketty. Thank you.

00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:45.708
Thomas, I want to ask you two or three questions,

00:15:45.708 --> 00:15:49.567
because it's impressive how you're
in command of your data, of course,

00:15:49.567 --> 00:15:53.361
but basically what you suggest is

00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:54.934
growing wealth concentration is kind of

00:15:54.934 --> 00:15:56.858
a natural tendency of capitalism,

00:15:56.858 --> 00:16:00.396
and if we leave it to its own devices,

00:16:00.396 --> 00:16:02.636
it may threaten the system itself,

00:16:02.636 --> 00:16:04.362
so you're suggesting that we need to act

00:16:04.362 --> 00:16:07.400
to implement policies that redistribute wealth,

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.121
including the ones we just saw:

00:16:09.121 --> 00:16:10.592
progressive taxation, etc.

00:16:10.592 --> 00:16:12.731
In the current political context,

00:16:12.731 --> 00:16:14.722
how realistic are those?

00:16:14.722 --> 00:16:16.533
How likely do you think that it is

00:16:16.533 --> 00:16:18.277
that they will be implemented?

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:19.488
Thomas Piketty: Well, you know, I think

00:16:19.488 --> 00:16:21.269
if you look back through time,

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:23.920
the history of income, wealth and taxation

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.522
is full of surprise.

00:16:25.522 --> 00:16:28.127
So I am not terribly impressed

00:16:28.127 --> 00:16:29.695
by those who know in advance

00:16:29.695 --> 00:16:31.326
what will or will not happen.

00:16:31.326 --> 00:16:33.030
I think one century ago,

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.599
many people would have said

00:16:34.599 --> 00:16:36.737
that progressive income taxation would never happen

00:16:36.737 --> 00:16:38.257
and then it happened.

00:16:38.257 --> 00:16:40.246
And even five years ago,

00:16:40.246 --> 00:16:42.598
many people would have said that bank secrecy

00:16:42.598 --> 00:16:44.623
will be with us forever in Switzerland,

00:16:44.623 --> 00:16:46.411
that Switzerland was too powerful

00:16:46.411 --> 00:16:47.900
for the rest of the world,

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.861
and then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions

00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:53.483
against Swiss banks for a big change to happen,

00:16:53.483 --> 00:16:55.186
and now we are moving toward

00:16:55.186 --> 00:16:56.862
more financial transparency.

00:16:56.862 --> 00:17:01.143
So I think it's not that difficult

00:17:01.143 --> 00:17:03.612
to better coordinate politically.

00:17:03.612 --> 00:17:05.670
We are going to have a treaty

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.719
with half of the world GDP around the table

00:17:08.719 --> 00:17:10.721
with the U.S. and the European Union,

00:17:10.721 --> 00:17:12.847
so if half of the world GDP is not enough

00:17:12.847 --> 00:17:15.513
to make progress on financial transparency

00:17:15.513 --> 00:17:19.597
and minimal tax for multinational corporate profits,

00:17:19.597 --> 00:17:21.261
what does it take?

00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:24.884
So I think these are not technical difficulties.

00:17:24.884 --> 00:17:26.808
I think we can make progress

00:17:26.808 --> 00:17:29.395
if we have a more pragmatic
approach to these questions

00:17:29.395 --> 00:17:31.296
and we have the proper sanctions

00:17:31.296 --> 00:17:34.287
on those who benefit from financial opacity.

00:17:34.287 --> 00:17:35.940
BG: One of the arguments

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.373
against your point of view

00:17:37.373 --> 00:17:38.815
is that economic inequality

00:17:38.815 --> 00:17:42.452
is not only a feature of capitalism
but is actually one of its engines.

00:17:42.452 --> 00:17:45.253
So we take measures to lower inequality,

00:17:45.253 --> 00:17:47.660
and at the same time we lower growth, potentially.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.220
What do you answer to that?

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.949
TP: Yeah, I think inequality

00:17:50.949 --> 00:17:52.838
is not a problem per se.

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:54.878
I think inequality up to a point

00:17:54.878 --> 00:17:57.530
can actually be useful for innovation and growth.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.723
The problem is, it's a question of degree.

00:17:59.723 --> 00:18:02.267
When inequality gets too extreme,

00:18:02.267 --> 00:18:05.156
then it becomes useless for growth

00:18:05.156 --> 00:18:06.618
and it can even become bad

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:09.675
because it tends to lead to high perpetuation

00:18:09.675 --> 00:18:11.311
of inequality over time

00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:13.177
and low mobility.

00:18:13.177 --> 00:18:16.463
And for instance, the kind of wealth concentrations

00:18:16.463 --> 00:18:19.340
that we had in the 19th century

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.265
and pretty much until World War I

00:18:21.265 --> 00:18:23.030
in every European country

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.124
was, I think, not useful for growth.

00:18:25.124 --> 00:18:27.226
This was destroyed by a combination

00:18:27.226 --> 00:18:29.567
of tragic events and policy changes,

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.839
and this did not prevent growth from happening.

00:18:31.839 --> 00:18:35.282
And also, extreme inequality can be bad

00:18:35.282 --> 00:18:37.480
for our democratic institutions

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.863
if it creates very unequal access to political voice,

00:18:39.863 --> 00:18:41.728
and the influence of private money

00:18:41.728 --> 00:18:43.730
in U.S. politics, I think,

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.270
is a matter of concern right now.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.346
So we don't want to return to that kind of extreme,

00:18:49.346 --> 00:18:51.436
pre-World War I inequality.

00:18:51.436 --> 00:18:55.110
Having a decent share of the national wealth

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.500
for the middle class is not bad for growth.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.781
It is actually useful

00:18:59.781 --> 00:19:02.865
both for equity and efficiency reasons.

00:19:02.865 --> 00:19:04.530
BG: I said at the beginning

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.639
that your book has been criticized.

00:19:06.639 --> 00:19:07.880
Some of your data has been criticized.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.346
Some of your choice of data sets has been criticized.

00:19:10.346 --> 00:19:12.222
You have been accused of cherry-picking data

00:19:12.222 --> 00:19:14.959
to make your case. What do you answer to that?

00:19:14.959 --> 00:19:16.886
TP: Well, I answer that I am very happy

00:19:16.886 --> 00:19:19.353
that this book is stimulating debate.

00:19:19.353 --> 00:19:21.834
This is part of what it is intended for.

00:19:21.834 --> 00:19:25.128
Look, the reason why I put all the data online

00:19:25.128 --> 00:19:26.974
with all of the detailed computation

00:19:26.974 --> 00:19:29.308
is so that we can have 
an open and transparent

00:19:29.308 --> 00:19:30.977
debate about this.

00:19:30.977 --> 00:19:32.743
So I have responded point by point

00:19:32.743 --> 00:19:34.535
to every concern.

00:19:34.535 --> 00:19:37.648
Let me say that if I was to rewrite the book today,

00:19:37.648 --> 00:19:39.189
I would actually conclude

00:19:39.189 --> 00:19:41.383
that the rise in wealth inequality,

00:19:41.383 --> 00:19:43.310
particularly in the United States,

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.683
has been actually higher
than what I report in my book.

00:19:45.683 --> 00:19:48.928
There is a recent study by Saez and Zucman

00:19:48.928 --> 00:19:50.520
showing, with new data

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.297
which I didn't have at the time of the book,

00:19:52.297 --> 00:19:54.824
that wealth concentration in the U.S. has risen

00:19:54.824 --> 00:19:56.760
even more than what I report.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.791
And there will be other data in the future.

00:19:58.791 --> 00:20:00.942
Some of it will go in different directions.

00:20:00.942 --> 00:20:05.041
Look, we put online almost every week

00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:07.975
new, updated series on the
World Top Income Database

00:20:07.975 --> 00:20:09.875
and we will keep doing so in the future,

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.181
in particular in emerging countries,

00:20:12.181 --> 00:20:15.110
and I welcome all of those who want to contribute

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.456
to this data collection process.

00:20:17.456 --> 00:20:20.264
In fact, I certainly agree

00:20:20.264 --> 00:20:21.878
that there is not enough

00:20:21.878 --> 00:20:23.756
transparency about wealth dynamics,

00:20:23.756 --> 00:20:25.671
and a good way to have better data

00:20:25.671 --> 00:20:27.536
would be to have a wealth tax

00:20:27.536 --> 00:20:29.107
with a small tax rate to begin with

00:20:29.107 --> 00:20:31.446
so that we can all agree

00:20:31.446 --> 00:20:33.010
about this important evolution

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:36.337
and adapt our policies to whatever we observe.

00:20:36.337 --> 00:20:38.399
So taxation is a source of knowledge,

00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:41.335
and that's what we need the most right now.

00:20:41.335 --> 00:20:43.150
BG: Thomas Piketty, merci beaucoup.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:47.150
Thank you.
TP: Thank you. (Applause)
