00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.561
This is my niece, Stella.

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:06.057
She's just turned one and started to walk.

00:00:06.057 --> 00:00:09.057
And she's walking in that really cool way that
one-year-olds do,

00:00:09.057 --> 00:00:14.273
a kind of teetering, my-body's-moving-
too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way.

00:00:14.273 --> 00:00:16.762
It is absolutely gorgeous.

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:19.380
And one of her favorite 
things to do at the moment

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.844
is to stare at herself in the mirror.

00:00:21.844 --> 00:00:24.999
She absolutely loves her reflection.

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:31.371
She giggles and squeals, and gives
herself these big, wet kisses.

00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:33.384
It is beautiful.

00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:38.676
Apparently, all of her friends do this and my mom
tells me that I used to do this,

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:40.191
and it got me thinking:

00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:43.648
When did I stop doing this?

00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:48.951
When is it suddenly not okay to love 
the way that we look?

00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:51.636
Because apparently we don't.

00:00:51.636 --> 00:00:55.065
Ten thousand people every month google,

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:57.211
"Am I ugly?"

00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:01.734
This is Faye. Faye is 13 and she 
lives in Denver.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:05.708
And like any teenager, she just wants to 
be liked and to fit in.

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:07.517
It's Sunday night.

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:10.211
She's getting ready for the week ahead at school.

00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:12.497
And she's slightly dreading it, and 
she's a bit confused because

00:01:12.497 --> 00:01:15.106
despite her mom telling her all the time

00:01:15.106 --> 00:01:17.452
that she's beautiful,

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:23.364
every day at school, someone tells her 
that she's ugly.

00:01:23.364 --> 00:01:26.629
Because of the difference between what her mom 
tells her and what her friends

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:29.653
at school, or her peers at school are telling her,

00:01:29.653 --> 00:01:32.018
she doesn't know who to believe.

00:01:32.018 --> 00:01:35.967
So, she takes a video of herself. 
She posts it to YouTube

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:38.293
and she asks people to please leave 
a comment:

00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:40.410
"Am I pretty or am I ugly?"

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.415
Well, so far, Faye has received 
over 13,000 comments.

00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:49.019
Some of them are so nasty, they don't 
bear thinking about.

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:54.950
This is an average, healthy-looking 
teenage girl receiving this feedback

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.184
at one of the most emotionally vulnerable
times in her life.

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:03.081
Thousands of people are posting videos like this,

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:06.918
mostly teenage girls, reaching out in this way.

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.867
But what's leading them to do this?

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:12.774
Well, today's teenagers are rarely alone.

00:02:12.774 --> 00:02:17.604
They're under pressure to be online
and available at all times,

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:22.145
talking, messaging, liking, commenting, 
sharing, posting —

00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:24.062
it never ends.

00:02:24.062 --> 00:02:27.012
Never before have we been so connected,

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:31.772
so continuously, so instantaneously, so young.

00:02:31.772 --> 00:02:36.632
And as one mom told me, it's like there's a party
in their bedroom every night.

00:02:36.632 --> 00:02:40.071
There's simply no privacy.

00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:44.424
And the social pressures that go along 
with that are relentless.

00:02:44.424 --> 00:02:49.302
This always-on environment is training
our kids to value themselves

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:51.013
based on the number of likes they get

00:02:51.013 --> 00:02:54.012
and the types of comments that they receive.

00:02:54.012 --> 00:02:58.591
There's no separation between online and offline life.

00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:04.164
What's real or what isn't is really
hard to tell the difference between.

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:07.955
And it's also really hard to tell the difference 
between what's authentic

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:10.241
and what's digitally manipulated.

00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:15.886
What's a highlight in someone's life versus
what's normal in the context of everyday.

00:03:15.886 --> 00:03:19.017
And where are they looking to for inspiration?

00:03:19.017 --> 00:03:22.829
Well, you can see the kinds of images
that are covering the newsfeeds

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.441
of girls today.

00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:27.655
Size zero models still dominate our catwalks.

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:30.312
Airbrushing is now routine.

00:03:30.312 --> 00:03:32.923
And trends like #thinspiration, #thighgap,

00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:35.042
#bikinibridge and #proana.

00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:38.586
For those who don't know, #proana means pro-anorexia.

00:03:38.586 --> 00:03:43.427
These trends are teamed with the 
stereotyping and flagrant objectification

00:03:43.427 --> 00:03:45.631
of women in today's popular culture.

00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:51.608
It is not hard to see what girls are
benchmarking themselves against.

00:03:51.608 --> 00:03:54.057
But boys are not immune to this either.

00:03:54.057 --> 00:03:59.189
Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs
of superhero-like sports stars

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.707
and playboy music artists.

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:04.079
But, what's the problem with all of this?

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:11.132
Well, surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy, 
well balanced individuals.

00:04:11.132 --> 00:04:15.008
But in an image-obsessed culture, we are
training our kids

00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:19.816
to spend more time and mental effort on 
their appearance

00:04:19.816 --> 00:04:24.111
at the expense of all of the other aspects
of their identities.

00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:28.221
So, things like their relationships, the development
of their physical abilities,

00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:32.256
and their studies and so on begin to suffer.

00:04:32.256 --> 00:04:37.858
Six out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do 
something because they don't

00:04:37.858 --> 00:04:39.722
think they look good enough.

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:42.104
These are not trivial activities.

00:04:42.104 --> 00:04:46.008
These are fundamental activities to their
development as humans

00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:51.358
and as contributors to society and to 
the workforce.

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:57.279
Thirty-one percent, nearly one in 
three teenagers, are withdrawing

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.851
from classroom debate. They're failing

00:04:58.851 --> 00:05:00.982
to engage in classroom debate because

00:05:00.982 --> 00:05:04.232
they don't want to draw attention to the 
way that they look.

00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:07.089
One in five are not showing up to class at all

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:09.456
on days when they don't feel good about it.

00:05:09.456 --> 00:05:10.876
And when it comes to exams,

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:13.225
if you don't think you look good enough,

00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:16.561
specifically if you don't think you are thin enough,

00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:19.667
you will score a lower grade point average

00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:22.464
than your peers who are not concerned with this.

00:05:22.464 --> 00:05:25.607
And this is consistent across Finland, the U.S.

00:05:25.607 --> 00:05:31.664
and China, and is true regardless of how much
you actually weigh.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:34.546
So to be super clear, we're talking about the

00:05:34.546 --> 00:05:39.789
way you think you look, not how
you actually look.

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.544
Low body confidence is undermining 
academic achievement.

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:46.952
But it's also damaging health.

00:05:46.952 --> 00:05:50.534
Teenagers with low body confidence
do less physical activity,

00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:52.657
eat less fruits and vegetables,

00:05:52.657 --> 00:05:55.692
partake in more unhealthy weight control
practices

00:05:55.692 --> 00:05:58.101
that can lead to eating disorders.

00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:00.654
They have lower self-esteem.

00:06:00.654 --> 00:06:02.740
They're more easily influenced by people around them

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.488
and they're at greater risk of depression.

00:06:05.488 --> 00:06:09.416
And we think it's for all of these reasons
that they take more risks

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:13.141
with things like alcohol and drug use;

00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:18.552
crash dieting; cosmetic surgery; 
unprotected, earlier sex;

00:06:18.552 --> 00:06:20.682
and self-harm.

00:06:20.682 --> 00:06:24.816
The pursuit of the perfect body is putting
pressure on our healthcare systems

00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:29.263
and costing our governments billions of 
dollars every year.

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:31.916
And we don't grow out of it.

00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:34.815
Women who think they're overweight — again,

00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:37.567
regardless of whether they are or are not —

00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:40.877
have higher rates of absenteeism.

00:06:40.877 --> 00:06:42.934
Seventeen percent of women would

00:06:42.934 --> 00:06:45.651
not show up to a job interview on

00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:50.961
a day when they weren't feeling confident
about the way that they look.

00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:52.866
Have a think about what this is doing

00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:54.582
to our economy.

00:06:54.582 --> 00:06:56.444
If we could overcome this, what that

00:06:56.444 --> 00:06:58.754
opportunity looks like.

00:06:58.754 --> 00:07:01.349
Unlocking this potential is in the interest

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:04.609
of every single one of us.

00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:06.181
But how do we do that?

00:07:06.181 --> 00:07:10.153
Well, talking, on its own, only gets you so far.

00:07:10.153 --> 00:07:12.037
It's not enough by itself.

00:07:12.037 --> 00:07:13.462
If you actually want to make a difference,

00:07:13.462 --> 00:07:15.598
you have to do something.

00:07:15.598 --> 00:07:18.672
And we've learned there are three key ways:

00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:21.314
The first is we have to educate for body confidence.

00:07:21.314 --> 00:07:23.236
We have to help our teenagers develop

00:07:23.236 --> 00:07:26.581
strategies to overcome image-related pressures

00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:28.131
and build their self-esteem.

00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:30.117
Now, the good news is that there are

00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:34.070
many programs out there available
to do this.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.820
The bad news is that most of them don't work.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.527
I was shocked to learn that many well-meaning

00:07:42.527 --> 00:07:45.755
programs are inadvertently actually

00:07:45.755 --> 00:07:49.150
making the situation worse.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.856
So we need to make damn sure that

00:07:50.856 --> 00:07:53.459
the programs that our kids are receiving

00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:55.419
are not only having a positive impact,

00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:58.387
but having a lasting impact as well.

00:07:58.387 --> 00:08:01.779
And the research shows 
that the best programs

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:03.854
address six key areas:

00:08:03.854 --> 00:08:07.917
The first is the influence of family, 
friends and relationships.

00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:11.381
The second is media and celebrity culture,

00:08:11.381 --> 00:08:13.433
then how to handle teasing and bullying,

00:08:13.433 --> 00:08:15.425
the way we compete and compare with
one another

00:08:15.425 --> 00:08:16.962
based on looks,

00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:18.712
talking about appearance — some people

00:08:18.712 --> 00:08:21.218
call this "body talk" or "fat talk" —

00:08:21.219 --> 00:08:23.693
and finally, the foundations of respecting

00:08:23.693 --> 00:08:25.467
and looking after yourself.

00:08:25.467 --> 00:08:27.940
These six things are crucial starting points

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.831
for anyone serious about delivering

00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:33.768
body-confidence education that works.

00:08:33.768 --> 00:08:36.074
An education is critical,

00:08:36.074 --> 00:08:37.895
but tackling this problem is going

00:08:37.895 --> 00:08:40.665
to require each and everyone of us

00:08:40.665 --> 00:08:43.255
to step up and be better role models

00:08:43.255 --> 00:08:46.233
for the women and girls in our own lives.

00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:48.166
Challenging the status quo of how

00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:51.170
women are seen and talked about in
our own circles.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.212
It is not okay that we judge the contribution

00:08:55.212 --> 00:08:58.370
of our politicians by their haircuts

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.099
or the size of their breasts,

00:09:00.099 --> 00:09:03.464
or to infer that the determination or the success

00:09:03.464 --> 00:09:06.697
of an Olympian is down 
to her not being a looker.

00:09:06.697 --> 00:09:09.803
We need to start judging people by what they do,

00:09:09.803 --> 00:09:12.354
not what they look like.

00:09:12.354 --> 00:09:16.718
We can all start by taking responsibility 
for the types of pictures

00:09:16.718 --> 00:09:18.361
and comments that we post

00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:20.548
on our own social networks.

00:09:20.548 --> 00:09:24.777
We can compliment people based on 
their effort

00:09:24.777 --> 00:09:26.180
and their actions

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.861
and not on their appearance.

00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:30.375
And let me ask you,

00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:31.663
when was the last time that you

00:09:31.663 --> 00:09:33.519
kissed a mirror?

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:35.812
Ultimately, we need to work together

00:09:35.812 --> 00:09:38.236
as communities, as governments

00:09:38.236 --> 00:09:42.701
and as businesses to really change
this culture of ours

00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:47.306
so that our kids grow up valuing their 
whole selves,

00:09:47.306 --> 00:09:51.969
valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.

00:09:51.969 --> 00:09:54.765
We need to put the people that are
making a real difference

00:09:54.765 --> 00:09:58.173
on our pedestals, making a difference

00:09:58.173 --> 00:10:00.153
in the real world.

00:10:00.153 --> 00:10:02.863
Giving them the airtime, because only then

00:10:02.863 --> 00:10:04.728
will we create a different world.

00:10:04.728 --> 00:10:08.057
A world where our kids are free to become

00:10:08.057 --> 00:10:11.302
the best versions of themselves,

00:10:11.302 --> 00:10:13.248
where the way they think they look

00:10:13.248 --> 00:10:15.889
never holds them back from being
who they are

00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:18.835
or achieving what they want in life.

00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:23.053
Think about what this might mean 
for someone in your life.

00:10:23.053 --> 00:10:24.551
Who have you got in mind?

00:10:24.551 --> 00:10:25.956
Is it your wife?

00:10:25.956 --> 00:10:27.344
Your sister?

00:10:27.344 --> 00:10:28.993
Your daughter?

00:10:28.993 --> 00:10:30.266
Your niece?

00:10:30.266 --> 00:10:33.329
Your friend? It could just be the woman 
a couple of seats away

00:10:33.329 --> 00:10:34.624
from you today.

00:10:34.624 --> 00:10:37.314
What would it mean for her

00:10:37.314 --> 00:10:41.072
if she were freed from that voice

00:10:41.072 --> 00:10:44.106
of her inner critic, nagging her to have

00:10:44.106 --> 00:10:46.897
longer legs, thinner thighs, smaller stomach,

00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:48.332
shorter feet?

00:10:48.332 --> 00:10:51.700
What could it mean for her if we overcame this

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.213
and unlocked her potential in that way?

00:10:56.213 --> 00:11:00.035
Right now, our culture's obsession

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:03.390
with image is holding us all back.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.917
But let's show our kids the truth.

00:11:05.917 --> 00:11:07.932
Let's show them that the way you look

00:11:07.932 --> 00:11:11.647
is just one part of your identity

00:11:11.647 --> 00:11:14.360
and that the truth is we love them

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.931
for who they are

00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:17.898
and what they do

00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:20.598
and how they make us feel.

00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:24.683
Let's build self-esteem into our school curriculums.

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:27.343
Let's each and every one of us change the way

00:11:27.343 --> 00:11:30.778
we talk and compare ourselves to other people.

00:11:30.778 --> 00:11:33.508
And let's work together as communities,

00:11:33.508 --> 00:11:36.302
from grassroots to governments,

00:11:36.302 --> 00:11:38.477
so that the happy little one-year-olds

00:11:38.477 --> 00:11:41.354
of today become the confident

00:11:41.354 --> 00:11:43.969
changemakers of tomorrow.

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:45.986
Let's do this.

00:11:45.986 --> 00:11:47.877
(Applause)
