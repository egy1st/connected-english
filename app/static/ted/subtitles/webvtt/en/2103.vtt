00:00:00.741 --> 00:00:02.383
Sleep.

00:00:02.383 --> 00:00:05.204
It's something we spend about
a third of our lives doing,

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:08.525
but do any of us really understand what it's all about?

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:10.740
Two thousand years ago, Galen,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.880
one of the most prominent medical researchers

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.939
of the ancient world,

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:16.258
proposed that while we're awake,

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:19.620
our brain's motive force, its juice,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.190
would flow out to all the other parts of the body,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.204
animating them but leaving the brain all dried up,

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:27.820
and he thought that when we sleep,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.358
all this moisture that filled the rest of the body

00:00:30.358 --> 00:00:32.102
would come rushing back,

00:00:32.102 --> 00:00:33.913
rehydrating the brain

00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:36.459
and refreshing the mind.

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:38.880
Now, that sounds completely ridiculous to us now,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.921
but Galen was simply trying to explain

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.528
something about sleep

00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:45.185
that we all deal with every day.

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:47.109
See, we all know based on our own experience

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.821
that when you sleep, it clears your mind,

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:51.283
and when you don't sleep,

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:54.210
it leaves your mind murky.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.722
But while we know a great deal more about sleep now

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.526
than when Galen was around,

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:01.406
we still haven't understood why it is that sleep,

00:01:01.406 --> 00:01:04.035
of all of our activities, has this incredible

00:01:04.035 --> 00:01:06.754
restorative function for the mind.

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:08.254
So today I want to tell you about

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:09.610
some recent research

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.368
that may shed new light on this question.

00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:15.573
We've found that sleep may actually be

00:01:15.573 --> 00:01:17.946
a kind of elegant design solution

00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:20.523
to some of the brain's most basic needs,

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:22.469
a unique way that the brain

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.292
meets the high demands and the narrow margins

00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:30.291
that set it apart from all the other organs of the body.

00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:33.346
So almost all the biology that we observe

00:01:33.346 --> 00:01:35.800
can be thought of as a series of problems

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.841
and their corresponding solutions,

00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:41.321
and the first problem that every organ must solve

00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:43.819
is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.560
all those cells of the body.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.138
In the brain, that is especially critical;

00:01:48.138 --> 00:01:50.355
its intense electrical activity uses up

00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:53.213
a quarter of the body's entire energy supply,

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.843
even though the brain accounts

00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:58.180
for only about two percent of the body's mass.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.792
So the circulatory system

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:02.223
solves the nutrient delivery problem

00:02:02.223 --> 00:02:04.763
by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients

00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:08.106
and oxygen to every corner of our body.

00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:11.120
You can actually see it in this video here.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.702
Here, we're imaging blood vessels

00:02:12.702 --> 00:02:15.597
in the brain of a living mouse.

00:02:15.597 --> 00:02:18.117
The blood vessels form a complex network

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:20.465
that fills the entire brain volume.

00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:22.266
They start at the surface of the brain,

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:25.147
and then they dive down into the tissue itself,

00:02:25.147 --> 00:02:27.508
and as they spread out, they supply nutrients

00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:33.273
and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain.

00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:36.246
Now, just as every cell requires

00:02:36.246 --> 00:02:38.137
nutrients to fuel it,

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:41.277
every cell also produces waste as a byproduct,

00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:42.823
and the clearance of that waste

00:02:42.823 --> 00:02:45.090
is the second basic problem

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.882
that each organ has to solve.

00:02:47.882 --> 00:02:50.465
This diagram shows the body's lymphatic system,

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:52.895
which has evolved to meet this need.

00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:55.707
It's a second parallel network of vessels

00:02:55.707 --> 00:02:57.721
that extends throughout the body.

00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:59.678
It takes up proteins and other waste

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:01.602
from the spaces between the cells,

00:03:01.602 --> 00:03:04.414
it collects them, and then dumps them into the blood

00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:06.675
so they can be disposed of.

00:03:06.675 --> 00:03:08.464
But if you look really closely at this diagram,

00:03:08.464 --> 00:03:09.858
you'll see something

00:03:09.858 --> 00:03:12.186
that doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:03:12.186 --> 00:03:14.943
So if we were to zoom into this guy's head,

00:03:14.943 --> 00:03:17.136
one of the things that you would see there

00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:21.298
is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain.

00:03:21.298 --> 00:03:24.392
But that doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?

00:03:24.392 --> 00:03:27.597
I mean, the brain is this intensely active organ

00:03:27.597 --> 00:03:30.162
that produces a correspondingly
large amount of waste

00:03:30.162 --> 00:03:32.739
that must be efficiently cleared.

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.701
And yet, it lacks lymphatic vessels, which means that

00:03:35.701 --> 00:03:37.497
the approach that the rest of the body takes

00:03:37.497 --> 00:03:39.482
to clearing away its waste

00:03:39.482 --> 00:03:42.491
won't work in the brain.

00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.539
So how, then, does the brain solve

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.293
its waste clearance problem?

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:49.982
Well, that seemingly mundane question

00:03:49.982 --> 00:03:53.390
is where our group first jumped into this story,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.411
and what we found

00:03:55.411 --> 00:03:57.746
as we dove down into the brain,

00:03:57.746 --> 00:04:00.637
down among the neurons and the blood vessels,

00:04:00.637 --> 00:04:02.820
was that the brain's solution

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.383
to the problem of waste clearance,

00:04:05.383 --> 00:04:07.200
it was really unexpected.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.050
It was ingenious,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.168
but it was also beautiful.

00:04:13.168 --> 00:04:14.835
Let me tell you about what we found.

00:04:14.835 --> 00:04:17.389
So the brain has this large pool

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.850
of clean, clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.169
We call it the CSF.

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.149
The CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain,

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:27.672
and wastes from inside the brain

00:04:27.672 --> 00:04:29.894
make their way out to the CSF,

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:33.157
which gets dumped, along with 
the waste, into the blood.

00:04:33.157 --> 00:04:34.277
So in that way, it sounds a lot like

00:04:34.277 --> 00:04:36.869
the lymphatic system, doesn't it?

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:39.625
But what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:41.357
from inside the brain,

00:04:41.357 --> 00:04:43.764
they don't just percolate their way randomly

00:04:43.764 --> 00:04:46.138
out to these pools of CSF.

00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:49.861
Instead, there is a specialized network of plumbing

00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:53.753
that organizes and facilitates this process.

00:04:53.753 --> 00:04:55.902
You can see that in these videos.

00:04:55.902 --> 00:04:58.940
Here, we're again imaging into the brain

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.424
of living mice.

00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:02.347
The frame on your left shows

00:05:02.347 --> 00:05:04.406
what's happening at the brain's surface,

00:05:04.406 --> 00:05:05.970
and the frame on your right shows

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.916
what's happening down below the surface of the brain

00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:09.639
within the tissue itself.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.898
We've labeled the blood vessels in red,

00:05:11.898 --> 00:05:13.922
and the CSF that's surrounding the brain

00:05:13.922 --> 00:05:15.745
will be in green.

00:05:15.745 --> 00:05:17.545
Now, what was surprising to us

00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:20.796
was that the fluid on the outside of the brain,

00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:23.608
it didn't stay on the outside.

00:05:23.608 --> 00:05:27.011
Instead, the CSF was pumped back into

00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.884
and through the brain

00:05:28.884 --> 00:05:31.916
along the outsides of the blood vessels,

00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:34.300
and as it flushed down into the brain

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.100
along the outsides of these vessels,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.912
it was actually helping to clear away,

00:05:38.912 --> 00:05:41.353
to clean the waste from the spaces

00:05:41.353 --> 00:05:44.199
between the brain's cells.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.111
If you think about it,

00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:49.588
using the outsides of these blood vessels like this

00:05:49.588 --> 00:05:52.107
is a really clever design solution,

00:05:52.107 --> 00:05:54.829
because the brain is enclosed

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:56.652
in a rigid skull

00:05:56.652 --> 00:05:58.755
and it's packed full of cells,

00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:01.500
so there is no extra space inside it

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.100
for a whole second set of vessels
like the lymphatic system.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.359
Yet the blood vessels,

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:08.317
they extend from the surface of the brain

00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:10.926
down to reach every single cell in the brain,

00:06:10.926 --> 00:06:12.164
which means that fluid

00:06:12.164 --> 00:06:15.460
that's traveling along the outsides of these vessels

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.260
can gain easy access to the entire brain's volume,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.444
so it's actually this really clever way

00:06:21.444 --> 00:06:25.209
to repurpose one set of vessels, the blood vessels,

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:27.998
to take over and replace the function

00:06:27.998 --> 00:06:31.181
of a second set of vessels, the lymphatic vessels,

00:06:31.181 --> 00:06:33.592
to make it so you don't need them.

00:06:33.592 --> 00:06:35.909
And what's amazing is that no other organ

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:37.550
takes quite this approach

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.610
to clearing away the waste from between its cells.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.430
This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.698
But our most surprising finding

00:06:48.698 --> 00:06:50.801
was that all of this,

00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:53.151
everything I just told you about,

00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:56.469
with all this fluid rushing through the brain,

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:00.653
it's only happening in the sleeping brain.

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:02.103
Here, the video on the left

00:07:02.103 --> 00:07:04.364
shows how much of the CSF is moving

00:07:04.364 --> 00:07:07.970
through the brain of a living mouse while it's awake.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.843
It's almost nothing.

00:07:09.843 --> 00:07:11.418
Yet in the same animal,

00:07:11.418 --> 00:07:14.623
if we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep,

00:07:14.623 --> 00:07:17.380
what we see is that the CSF

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.798
is rushing through the brain,

00:07:19.798 --> 00:07:21.958
and we discovered that at the same time

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.570
when the brain goes to sleep,

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.233
the brain cells themselves seem to shrink,

00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:29.270
opening up spaces in between them,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.407
allowing fluid to rush through

00:07:31.407 --> 00:07:34.140
and allowing waste to be cleared out.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.654
So it seems that Galen may actually have been

00:07:36.654 --> 00:07:38.910
sort of on the right track when he wrote about

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.610
fluid rushing through the brain

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.252
when sleep came on.

00:07:43.252 --> 00:07:46.705
Our own research, now it's 2,000 years later,

00:07:46.705 --> 00:07:48.775
suggests that what's happening is that

00:07:48.775 --> 00:07:50.834
when the brain is awake

00:07:50.834 --> 00:07:52.948
and is at its most busy,

00:07:52.948 --> 00:07:55.310
it puts off clearing away the waste

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.381
from the spaces between its cells until later,

00:07:58.381 --> 00:08:00.240
and then, when it goes to sleep

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.588
and doesn't have to be as busy,

00:08:02.588 --> 00:08:05.165
it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode

00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:06.852
to clear away the waste

00:08:06.852 --> 00:08:08.360
from the spaces between its cells,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.777
the waste that's accumulated throughout the day.

00:08:10.777 --> 00:08:13.185
So it's actually a little bit like how you or I,

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:16.267
we put off our household chores during the work week

00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:17.729
when we don't have time to get to it,

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:20.990
and then we play catch up on all
the cleaning that we have to do

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.748
when the weekend rolls around.

00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:27.020
Now, I've just talked a lot about waste clearance,

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.472
but I haven't been very specific

00:08:28.472 --> 00:08:29.866
about the kinds of waste

00:08:29.866 --> 00:08:32.161
that the brain needs to be clearing

00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:34.704
during sleep in order to stay healthy.

00:08:34.704 --> 00:08:36.301
The waste product that these recent studies

00:08:36.301 --> 00:08:38.719
focused most on is amyloid-beta,

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:41.914
which is a protein that's made
in the brain all the time.

00:08:41.914 --> 00:08:43.772
My brain's making amyloid-beta right now,

00:08:43.772 --> 00:08:45.930
and so is yours.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.932
But in patients with Alzheimer's disease,

00:08:47.932 --> 00:08:50.531
amyloid-beta builds up and aggregates

00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:52.544
in the spaces between the brain's cells,

00:08:52.544 --> 00:08:55.970
instead of being cleared away 
like it's supposed to be,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.980
and it's this buildup of amyloid-beta

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.193
that's thought to be one of the key steps

00:09:00.193 --> 00:09:02.814
in the development of that terrible disease.

00:09:02.814 --> 00:09:05.908
So we measured how fast amyloid-beta is cleared

00:09:05.908 --> 00:09:07.640
from the brain when it's awake

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.418
versus when it's asleep,

00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:11.296
and we found that indeed,

00:09:11.296 --> 00:09:13.186
the clearance of amyloid-beta

00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:17.705
is much more rapid from the sleeping brain.

00:09:17.705 --> 00:09:19.384
So if sleep, then,

00:09:19.384 --> 00:09:21.342
is part of the brain's solution

00:09:21.342 --> 00:09:23.352
to the problem of waste clearance,

00:09:23.352 --> 00:09:25.728
then this may dramatically change how we think

00:09:25.728 --> 00:09:27.963
about the relationship between sleep,

00:09:27.963 --> 00:09:31.319
amyloid-beta, and Alzheimer's disease.

00:09:31.319 --> 00:09:33.277
A series of recent clinical studies

00:09:33.277 --> 00:09:35.110
suggest that among patients

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.204
who haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease,

00:09:38.204 --> 00:09:41.270
worsening sleep quality and sleep duration

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.288
are associated with a greater amount

00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:46.100
of amyloid-beta building up in the brain,

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.967
and while it's important to point out

00:09:47.967 --> 00:09:49.677
that these studies don't prove

00:09:49.677 --> 00:09:51.866
that lack of sleep or poor sleep

00:09:51.866 --> 00:09:54.273
cause Alzheimer's disease,

00:09:54.273 --> 00:09:56.883
they do suggest that the failure of the brain

00:09:56.883 --> 00:09:58.795
to keep its house clean

00:09:58.795 --> 00:10:01.551
by clearing away waste like amyloid-beta

00:10:01.551 --> 00:10:03.453
may contribute to the development

00:10:03.453 --> 00:10:07.070
of conditions like Alzheimer's.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.975
So what this new research tells us, then,

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:11.302
is that the one thing that all of you

00:10:11.302 --> 00:10:12.710
already knew about sleep,

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.363
that even Galen understood about sleep,

00:10:15.363 --> 00:10:18.434
that it refreshes and clears the mind,

00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:19.975
may actually be a big part

00:10:19.975 --> 00:10:22.292
of what sleep is all about.

00:10:22.292 --> 00:10:23.810
See, you and I, we go to sleep

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.543
every single night,

00:10:25.543 --> 00:10:28.546
but our brains, they never rest.

00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:30.380
While our body is still

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.451
and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere,

00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:35.127
the elegant machinery of the brain

00:10:35.127 --> 00:10:37.107
is quietly hard at work

00:10:37.107 --> 00:10:39.300
cleaning and maintaining

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.135
this unimaginably complex machine.

00:10:42.135 --> 00:10:43.176
Like our housework,

00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:45.925
it's a dirty and a thankless job,

00:10:45.925 --> 00:10:48.180
but it's also important.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.583
In your house, if you stop cleaning your kitchen

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:52.491
for a month,

00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:54.930
your home will become completely unlivable

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.537
very quickly.

00:10:56.537 --> 00:10:58.625
But in the brain, the consequences

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:01.556
of falling behind may be much greater

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:04.284
than the embarrassment of dirty countertops,

00:11:04.284 --> 00:11:06.848
because when it comes to cleaning the brain,

00:11:06.848 --> 00:11:09.224
it is the very health and function

00:11:09.224 --> 00:11:12.169
of the mind and the body that's at stake,

00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:14.410
which is why understanding these

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.682
very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today

00:11:18.682 --> 00:11:21.675
may be critical for preventing and treating

00:11:21.675 --> 00:11:24.703
diseases of the mind tomorrow.

00:11:24.703 --> 00:11:26.751
Thank you.

00:11:26.751 --> 00:11:28.518
