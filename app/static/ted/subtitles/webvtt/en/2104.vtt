WEBVTT

00:00:00.744 --> 00:00:03.851
I have the feeling that we can all agree

00:00:03.851 --> 00:00:06.078
that we're moving towards a new

00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:08.943
model of the state and society.

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:13.424
But, we're absolutely clueless as to what this is

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:15.110
or what it should be.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.137
It seems like we need to have

00:00:17.137 --> 00:00:20.139
a conversation about democracy

00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:22.494
in our day and age.

00:00:22.494 --> 00:00:24.990
Let's think about it this way:

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.976
We are 21st-century citizens, doing our

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:35.072
very, very best to interact with 19th century-designed
institutions

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:40.395
that are based on an information technology of the 15th century.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:41.806
Let's have a look at some of the

00:00:41.806 --> 00:00:44.242
characteristics of this system.

00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:47.747
First of all, it's designed for an information technology

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:50.846
that's over 500 years old.

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:53.082
And the best possible system

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:54.617
that could be designed for it

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:58.841
is one where the few make daily decisions

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.275
in the name of the many.

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:05.810
And the many get to vote once every 
couple of years.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.159
In the second place, the costs of

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.451
participating in this system are

00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:10.658
incredibly high.

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:13.700
You either have to have a fair 
bit of money

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.052
and influence, or you have to devote your entire

00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:19.890
life to politics.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830
You have to become a party member

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.448
and slowly start working up the ranks

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:29.364
until maybe, one day, you'll get 
to sit at a table

00:01:29.364 --> 00:01:31.933
where a decision is being made.

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.749
And last but not least,

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.669
the language of the system â€”

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:37.518
it's incredibly cryptic.

00:01:37.518 --> 00:01:40.702
It's done for lawyers, by lawyers,

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:43.548
and no one else can understand.

00:01:43.548 --> 00:01:46.223
So, it's a system where we can

00:01:46.223 --> 00:01:48.158
choose our authorities,

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:51.994
but we are completely left out on how
those authorities

00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:54.845
reach their decisions.

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:58.160
So, in a day where a new information technology

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.456
allows us to participate globally
in any conversation,

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:07.609
our barriers of information are completely lowered

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:11.088
and we can, more than ever before,

00:02:11.088 --> 00:02:14.766
express our desires and our concerns.

00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:17.519
Our political system remains the same

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.135
for the past 200 years

00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:26.918
and expects us to be contented with being 
simply passive recipients

00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:28.661
of a monologue.

00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:31.104
So, it's really not surprising that

00:02:31.104 --> 00:02:34.446
this kind of system is only able to produce

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:36.378
two kinds of results:

00:02:36.378 --> 00:02:40.047
silence or noise.

00:02:40.047 --> 00:02:43.836
Silence, in terms of citizens not engaging,

00:02:43.836 --> 00:02:46.732
simply not wanting to participate.

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:50.010
There's this commonplace 
[idea] that I truly, truly dislike,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.069
and it's this idea that we citizens are naturally

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.175
apathetic. That we shun commitment.

00:02:57.175 --> 00:02:58.702
But, can you really blame us

00:02:58.702 --> 00:03:01.576
for not jumping at the opportunity of going

00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:03.595
to the middle of the city in the middle

00:03:03.595 --> 00:03:06.944
of a working day to attend, physically,

00:03:06.944 --> 00:03:10.364
a public hearing that has no impact

00:03:10.364 --> 00:03:12.304
whatsoever?

00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:16.692
Conflict is bound to happen between a system

00:03:16.692 --> 00:03:22.887
that no longer represents, nor has any dialogue capacity,

00:03:22.887 --> 00:03:25.965
and citizens that are increasingly used

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:28.311
to representing themselves.

00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:30.615
And, then we find noise:

00:03:30.615 --> 00:03:36.994
Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico
Italy, France, Spain, the United States,

00:03:36.994 --> 00:03:38.853
they're all democracies.

00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:40.765
Their citizens have access to

00:03:40.765 --> 00:03:45.021
the ballot boxes. But they still feel the need,

00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:50.531
they need to take to the streets in order 
to be heard.

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:55.022
To me, it seems like the 18th-century

00:03:55.022 --> 00:03:58.082
slogan that was the basis for the formation

00:03:58.082 --> 00:04:01.734
of our modern democracies, "No taxation

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:04.037
without representation,"

00:04:04.037 --> 00:04:11.168
can now be updated to "No representation
without a conversation."

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:15.704
We want our seat at the table.

00:04:15.704 --> 00:04:18.010
And rightly so.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.390
But in order to be part of this conversation,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.901
we need to know what we want to do next,

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:27.108
because political action is being able

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:29.429
to move from agitation

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:31.293
to construction.

00:04:31.293 --> 00:04:35.130
My generation has been incredibly good at

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.751
using new networks and technologies

00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:40.266
to organize protests,

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:42.684
protests that were able to successfully

00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:44.643
impose agendas,

00:04:44.643 --> 00:04:48.066
roll back extremely pernicious legislation,

00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:51.267
and even overthrow authoritarian governments.

00:04:51.267 --> 00:04:53.263
And we should be immensely

00:04:53.263 --> 00:04:55.622
proud of this.

00:04:55.622 --> 00:04:57.470
But, we also must admit that we

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.958
haven't been good at using those

00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.846
same networks and technologies

00:05:02.846 --> 00:05:08.244
to successfully articulate an alternative
to what we're seeing

00:05:08.244 --> 00:05:13.061
and find the consensus and build 
the alliances that are needed

00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:15.079
to make it happen.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:17.575
And so the risk that we face

00:05:17.575 --> 00:05:21.208
is that we can create these huge power vacuums

00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:25.295
that will very quickly get filled up by de facto

00:05:25.295 --> 00:05:28.176
powers, like the military or highly

00:05:28.176 --> 00:05:31.075
motivated and already organized groups

00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:34.745
that generally lie on the extremes.

00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:36.697
But our democracy is neither

00:05:36.697 --> 00:05:39.466
just a matter of voting once every

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:40.721
couple of years.

00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:46.657
But it's not either the ability to bring millions
onto the streets.

00:05:46.657 --> 00:05:49.478
So the question I'd like to raise here,

00:05:49.478 --> 00:05:53.000
and I do believe it's the most important 
question we need to answer,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.357
is this one:

00:05:54.357 --> 00:05:58.036
If Internet is the new printing press,

00:05:58.036 --> 00:06:02.872
then what is democracy for the Internet era?

00:06:02.872 --> 00:06:05.822
What institutions do we want to build

00:06:05.822 --> 00:06:09.781
for the 21st-century society?

00:06:09.781 --> 00:06:13.007
I don't have the answer, just in case.

00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:14.441
I don't think anyone does.

00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:19.456
But I truly believe we can't afford
to ignore this question anymore.

00:06:19.456 --> 00:06:21.393
So, I'd like to share our experience

00:06:21.393 --> 00:06:23.119
and what we've learned so far

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:25.542
and hopefully contribute two cents

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:27.720
to this conversation.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.438
Two years ago, with a group of friends
from Argentina,

00:06:31.438 --> 00:06:35.487
we started thinking, "how can 
we get our representatives,

00:06:35.487 --> 00:06:37.371
our elected representatives,

00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:41.719
to represent us?"

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:45.724
Marshall McLuhan once said that politics

00:06:45.724 --> 00:06:50.419
is solving today's problems with yesterday's tools.

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.933
So the question that motivated us was,

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:56.827
can we try and solve some of today's problems

00:06:56.827 --> 00:07:00.929
with the tools that we use every single
day of our lives?

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:03.879
Our first approach was to design and develop

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:07.130
a piece of software called DemocracyOS.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.255
DemocracyOS is an open-source web application

00:07:10.255 --> 00:07:13.453
that is designed to become a bridge

00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:16.531
between citizens and their elected representatives

00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:22.239
to make it easier for us to participate 
from our everyday lives.

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:25.578
So first of all, you can get informed so every new

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:28.254
project that gets introduced in Congress

00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:31.383
gets immediately translated and explained

00:07:31.383 --> 00:07:34.318
in plain language on this platform.

00:07:34.318 --> 00:07:37.614
But we all know that social change

00:07:37.614 --> 00:07:40.372
is not going to come from just knowing

00:07:40.372 --> 00:07:41.644
more information,

00:07:41.644 --> 00:07:44.143
but from doing something with it.

00:07:44.143 --> 00:07:46.362
So better access to information

00:07:46.362 --> 00:07:48.693
should lead to a conversation

00:07:48.693 --> 00:07:50.544
about what we're going to do next,

00:07:50.544 --> 00:07:52.626
and DemocracyOS allows for that.

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:54.912
Because we believe that democracy is

00:07:54.912 --> 00:07:56.957
not just a matter of stacking up

00:07:56.957 --> 00:07:59.776
preferences, one on top of each other,

00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:03.484
but that our healthy and robust public debate

00:08:03.484 --> 00:08:07.541
should be, once again, one of its fundamental values.

00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:11.743
So DemocracyOS is about persuading 
and being persuaded.

00:08:11.743 --> 00:08:14.474
It's about reaching a consensus

00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:17.771
as much as finding a proper way

00:08:17.771 --> 00:08:20.496
of channeling our disagreement.

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:22.486
And finally, you can vote

00:08:22.486 --> 00:08:26.586
how you would like your elected 
representative to vote.

00:08:26.586 --> 00:08:28.026
And if you do not feel comfortable

00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:30.140
voting on a certain issue,

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.024
you can always delegate your vote

00:08:32.024 --> 00:08:33.767
to someone else, allowing

00:08:33.767 --> 00:08:39.346
for a dynamic and emerging social leadership.

00:08:39.346 --> 00:08:40.729
It suddenly became very easy for us

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.444
to simply compare these results

00:08:43.444 --> 00:08:45.148
with how our representatives were

00:08:45.148 --> 00:08:46.551
voting in Congress.

00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:48.984
But, it also became very evident that

00:08:48.984 --> 00:08:52.942
technology was not going to do the trick.

00:08:52.942 --> 00:08:54.821
What we needed to do to was to find

00:08:54.821 --> 00:08:57.441
actors that were able to

00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:00.345
grab this distributed knowledge

00:09:00.345 --> 00:09:06.409
in society and use it to make better
and more fair decisions.

00:09:06.409 --> 00:09:09.697
So we reached out to traditional political parties

00:09:09.697 --> 00:09:11.892
and we offered them DemocracyOS.

00:09:11.892 --> 00:09:16.216
We said, "Look, here you have a platform
that you can use to build

00:09:16.216 --> 00:09:20.124
a two-way conversation with your constituencies."

00:09:20.124 --> 00:09:22.687
And yes, we failed.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:25.683
We failed big time.

00:09:25.683 --> 00:09:30.009
We were sent to play 
outside like little kids.

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:32.405
Amongst other things, we were called naive.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:36.201
And I must be honest: I think, in hindsight, we were.

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.667
Because the challenges that we face, they're not

00:09:38.667 --> 00:09:41.552
technological, they're cultural.

00:09:41.552 --> 00:09:43.946
Political parties were never willing

00:09:43.946 --> 00:09:47.950
to change the way they make their decisions.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.678
So it suddenly became a bit obvious

00:09:49.678 --> 00:09:53.094
that if we wanted to move forward
with this idea,

00:09:53.094 --> 00:09:56.035
we needed to do it ourselves.

00:09:56.035 --> 00:09:58.044
And so we took quite a leap of faith,

00:09:58.044 --> 00:10:00.869
and in August last year, we founded

00:10:00.869 --> 00:10:02.965
our own political party,

00:10:02.965 --> 00:10:04.078
El Partido de la Red,

00:10:04.078 --> 00:10:08.250
or the Net Party, in the city of 
Buenos Aires.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.927
And taking an even bigger leap of faith,

00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:16.173
we ran for elections in October last year

00:10:16.173 --> 00:10:17.769
with this idea:

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:20.366
if we want a seat in Congress,

00:10:20.366 --> 00:10:22.384
our candidate, our representatives

00:10:22.384 --> 00:10:25.758
were always going to vote according to

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:29.267
what citizens decided on DemocracyOS.

00:10:29.267 --> 00:10:32.119
Every single project that got introduced

00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:33.846
in Congress, we were going vote

00:10:33.846 --> 00:10:38.588
according to what citizens decided
on an online platform.

00:10:38.588 --> 00:10:42.238
It was our way of hacking the political system.

00:10:42.238 --> 00:10:44.164
We understood that if we wanted

00:10:44.164 --> 00:10:46.513
to become part of the conversation,

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:48.185
to have a seat at the table,

00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:51.894
we needed to become valid stakeholders,

00:10:51.894 --> 00:10:56.116
and the only way of doing it is to play by the 
system rules.

00:10:56.116 --> 00:10:59.105
But we were hacking it in the sense that

00:10:59.105 --> 00:11:03.193
we were radically changing the way a political party

00:11:03.193 --> 00:11:04.612
makes its decisions.

00:11:04.612 --> 00:11:08.115
For the first time, we were making our decisions

00:11:08.115 --> 00:11:10.868
together with those who we were

00:11:10.868 --> 00:11:15.247
affecting directly by those decisions.

00:11:15.247 --> 00:11:18.985
It was a very, very bold move for a two-month-old party

00:11:18.985 --> 00:11:20.664
in the city of Buenos Aires.

00:11:20.664 --> 00:11:22.239
But it got attention.

00:11:22.239 --> 00:11:26.952
We got 22,000 votes, that's 1.2 percent of the votes,

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:31.128
and we came in second for the local options.

00:11:31.128 --> 00:11:33.328
So, even if that wasn't enough to win a

00:11:33.328 --> 00:11:35.454
seat in Congress, it was enough

00:11:35.454 --> 00:11:38.637
for us to become part of the conversation,

00:11:38.637 --> 00:11:42.208
to the extent that next month,

00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:45.229
Congress, as an institution, is launching

00:11:45.229 --> 00:11:48.097
for the first time in Argentina's history,

00:11:48.097 --> 00:11:50.519
a DemocracyOS to discuss,

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:54.189
with the citizens, three pieces of legislation:

00:11:54.189 --> 00:11:56.296
two on urban transportation and

00:11:56.296 --> 00:11:59.288
one on the use of public space.

00:11:59.288 --> 00:12:02.077
Of course, our elected representatives are not

00:12:02.077 --> 00:12:04.094
saying, "Yes, we're going to vote

00:12:04.094 --> 00:12:06.667
according to what citizens decide,"

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:08.693
but they're willing to try.

00:12:08.693 --> 00:12:11.923
They're willing to open up a new space

00:12:11.923 --> 00:12:14.568
for citizen engagement and hopefully

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:17.824
they'll be willing to listen as well.

00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:21.888
Our political system can be transformed,

00:12:21.888 --> 00:12:25.566
and not by subverting it, by destroying it,

00:12:25.566 --> 00:12:29.185
but by rewiring it with the tools that

00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:31.937
Internet affords us now.

00:12:31.937 --> 00:12:36.324
But a real challenge is to find, to design

00:12:36.324 --> 00:12:39.753
to create, to empower those connectors

00:12:39.753 --> 00:12:43.572
that are able to innovate, to transform

00:12:43.572 --> 00:12:46.240
noise and silence into signal

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.178
and finally bring our democracies

00:12:48.178 --> 00:12:50.506
to the 21st century.

00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:53.237
I'm not saying it's easy.

00:12:53.237 --> 00:12:56.820
But in our experience, we actually stand a chance

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.154
of making it work.

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:02.286
And in my heart, it's most definitely

00:13:02.286 --> 00:13:03.567
worth trying.

00:13:03.567 --> 00:13:04.799
Thank you.

00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:10.846
(Applause)
