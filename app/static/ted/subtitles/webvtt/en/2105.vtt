00:00:00.924 --> 00:00:05.112
I live in Washington, D.C.,

00:00:05.112 --> 00:00:12.479
but I grew up in Sindhekela, a village in Orissa,
in India.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.973
My father was a government worker.

00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:20.859
My mother could not read or write, but she

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.303
would say to me, "A king is 
worshipped only in his

00:00:26.303 --> 00:00:32.441
own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere."

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:35.895
So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up.

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:40.077
But I almost didn't go to college

00:00:40.077 --> 00:00:44.609
until an aunt offered financial help.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.794
I went to study in Sambalpur,

00:00:46.794 --> 00:00:50.989
the largest town in the region,

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.988
where, already in college, I saw a
television for the first time.

00:00:57.988 --> 00:01:00.148
I had dreams of going to the United States

00:01:00.148 --> 00:01:02.748
for higher studies.

00:01:02.748 --> 00:01:04.877
When the opportunity came,

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:07.212
I crossed two oceans, with borrowed money

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:13.905
for airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket.

00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:18.512
In the U.S., I worked in a research center,

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:22.817
part-time, while taking graduate classes in economics.

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:28.151
And with the little I earned, I would

00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:30.458
finance myself and then I would send

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:34.916
money home to my brother and my father.

00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:38.285
My story is not unique.

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:42.559
There are millions of people who migrate each year.

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:46.340
With the help of the family, they cross oceans,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.155
they cross deserts, they cross 
rivers, they cross mountains.

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:57.483
They risk their lives to realize a dream,

00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:00.156
and that dream is as simple as having a

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:03.467
decent job somewhere so they can send money home

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:05.297
and help the family,

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:09.954
which has helped them before.

00:02:09.954 --> 00:02:15.046
There are 232 million international 
migrants in the world.

00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:16.395
These are people who live in a country

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:19.051
other than their country of birth.

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:20.760
If there was a country made up of

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.369
only international migrants,

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:24.426
that would be larger, in population,

00:02:24.426 --> 00:02:25.863
than Brazil.

00:02:25.863 --> 00:02:27.868
That would be larger, in its size

00:02:27.868 --> 00:02:31.070
of the economy, than France.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.567
Some 180 million of them, from poor countries,

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:38.718
send money home regularly.

00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:43.743
Those sums of money are called remittances.

00:02:43.743 --> 00:02:47.730
Here is a fact that might surprise you:

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.453
413 billion dollars, 413 billion dollars

00:02:52.453 --> 00:02:55.486
was the amount of remittances sent last year

00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:58.522
by migrants to developing countries.

00:02:58.522 --> 00:02:59.806
Migrants from developing countries,

00:02:59.806 --> 00:03:01.950
money sent to developing countries â€”

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.400
413 billion dollars.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.120
That's a remarkable number because

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.985
that is three times the size of

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:11.799
the total of development aid money.

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.262
And yet, you and I,

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:16.768
my colleagues in Washington,

00:03:16.768 --> 00:03:18.765
we endlessly debate and

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:21.193
discuss about development aid,

00:03:21.193 --> 00:03:25.482
while we ignore remittances as small change.

00:03:25.482 --> 00:03:28.635
True, people send 200 dollars per month,

00:03:28.635 --> 00:03:32.706
on average. But, repeated month after month,

00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:34.744
by millions of people,

00:03:34.744 --> 00:03:38.811
these sums of money add up to rivers 
of foreign currency.

00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:43.905
So India, last year, received 72 
billion dollars, larger than

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.361
its IT exports.

00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:49.345
In Egypt remittances are three times

00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:52.917
the size of revenues from the Suez Canal.

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:56.729
In Tajikistan, remittances are 42 percent of GDP.

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.568
And in poorer countries, smaller 
countries, fragile countries,

00:03:59.568 --> 00:04:04.637
conflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline,

00:04:04.637 --> 00:04:08.013
as in Somalia or in Haiti.

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:10.016
No wonder these flows have huge

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:14.916
impacts on economies and on poor people.

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:18.725
Remittances, unlike private investment money,

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:21.752
they don't flow back at the first

00:04:21.752 --> 00:04:23.543
sign of trouble in the country.

00:04:23.543 --> 00:04:26.428
They actually act like an insurance.

00:04:26.428 --> 00:04:28.848
When the family is in trouble,

00:04:28.848 --> 00:04:31.453
facing hardship, facing hard times,

00:04:31.453 --> 00:04:33.520
remittances increase, they act like an insurance.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.079
Migrants send more money then.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:37.674
Unlike development aid money,

00:04:37.674 --> 00:04:40.251
that must go through official agencies,

00:04:40.251 --> 00:04:43.368
through governments, remittances

00:04:43.368 --> 00:04:44.993
directly reach the poor,

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.311
reach the family,

00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:48.865
and often with business advice.

00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:52.045
So in Nepal, the share of poor

00:04:52.045 --> 00:04:54.873
people was 42 percent in 1995,

00:04:54.873 --> 00:04:57.060
the share of poor people in the population.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.662
By 2005, a decade later, at a

00:05:00.662 --> 00:05:03.470
time of political crisis, economic crisis,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.839
the share of poor people went down to 31 percent.

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:11.115
That decline in poverty, most of it,

00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:13.014
about half of it, is believed to be

00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:15.741
because of remittances from India,

00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:17.880
another poor country.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.043
In El Salvador, the school dropout

00:05:22.043 --> 00:05:25.281
rate among children is lower

00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:27.087
in families that receive remittances.

00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:29.056
In Mexico and Sri Lanka,

00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:33.455
the birth weight of children is higher

00:05:33.455 --> 00:05:38.869
among families that receive remittances.

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:42.568
Remittances are dollars wrapped with care.

00:05:42.568 --> 00:05:45.289
Migrants send money home for food,

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.541
for buying necessities, for building houses,

00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:49.929
for funding education, for funding

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:52.658
healthcare for the elderly, for business

00:05:52.658 --> 00:05:54.916
investments for friends and family.

00:05:54.916 --> 00:05:57.255
Migrants send even more money home

00:05:57.255 --> 00:06:00.003
for special occasions like a surgery

00:06:00.003 --> 00:06:03.767
or a wedding. And migrants also send

00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:06.707
money, perhaps far too many times,

00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:09.103
for unexpected funerals that

00:06:09.103 --> 00:06:13.001
they cannot attend.

00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:15.679
Much as these flows do all that good,

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:17.077
there are barriers to these

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:18.987
flows of remittances, these

00:06:18.987 --> 00:06:21.509
400 billion dollars of remittances.

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:23.490
Foremost among them is

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.796
the exorbitant cost of sending money home.

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:29.793
Money transfer companies structure

00:06:29.793 --> 00:06:33.567
their fees to milk the poor.

00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:36.569
They will say, "Up to 500 dollars

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:38.244
if you want to send, we will charge you

00:06:38.244 --> 00:06:40.538
30 dollars fixed."

00:06:40.538 --> 00:06:43.634
If you are poor and if you have 
only 200 dollars to send,

00:06:43.634 --> 00:06:46.876
you have to pay that $30 fee.

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:48.911
The global average cost of sending

00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:51.448
money is eight percent.

00:06:51.448 --> 00:06:52.999
That means you send 100 dollars,

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:54.672
the family on the other side receives only

00:06:54.672 --> 00:06:56.229
92 dollars.

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:58.013
To send money to Africa,

00:06:58.013 --> 00:06:59.596
the cost is even higher:

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.942
12 percent.

00:07:00.942 --> 00:07:02.916
To send money within Africa,

00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:04.400
the cost is even higher:

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.719
over 20 percent.

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:09.588
For example, sending money from Benin 
to Nigeria.

00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:13.840
And then there is the case of Venezuela, where,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.321
because of exchange controls,

00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:17.321
you send 100 dollars and you

00:07:17.321 --> 00:07:19.339
are lucky if the family on the other side

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:22.749
receives even 10 dollars.

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:25.693
Of course, nobody sends money to Venezuela

00:07:25.693 --> 00:07:27.316
through the official channel.

00:07:27.316 --> 00:07:29.440
It all goes in suitcases.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.510
Whereever costs are high,

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.893
money goes underground.

00:07:33.893 --> 00:07:35.829
And what is worse,

00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:38.160
many developing countries actually

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.407
have a blanket ban on sending money

00:07:40.407 --> 00:07:42.110
out of the country.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.247
Many rich nations also have a

00:07:44.247 --> 00:07:49.743
blanket ban on sending money 
to specific countries.

00:07:49.743 --> 00:07:51.854
So, is it that there are no options,

00:07:51.854 --> 00:07:54.487
no better options, cheaper options, to send money?

00:07:54.487 --> 00:07:55.278
There are.

00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:58.998
M-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money

00:07:58.998 --> 00:08:01.639
and receive money at a fixed cost of only

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:04.536
60 cents per transaction.

00:08:04.536 --> 00:08:07.402
U.S. Fed started a program with Mexico

00:08:07.402 --> 00:08:09.041
to enable money service businesses

00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:10.619
to send money to Mexico

00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:15.852
for a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction.

00:08:15.852 --> 00:08:18.807
And yet, these faster, cheaper, better options

00:08:18.807 --> 00:08:21.794
can't be applied internationally

00:08:21.794 --> 00:08:24.635
because of the fear of money laundering,

00:08:24.635 --> 00:08:27.486
even though there is little data

00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:30.211
to support any connection, any significant

00:08:30.211 --> 00:08:31.883
connection between money laundering

00:08:31.883 --> 00:08:37.273
and these small remittance transactions.

00:08:37.273 --> 00:08:38.700
Many international banks now

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.589
are wary of hosting bank accounts

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:44.990
of money service businesses, especially

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.650
those serving Somalia.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.347
Somalia, a country where the

00:08:50.347 --> 00:08:57.491
per capita income is only 250 dollars per year.

00:08:57.491 --> 00:08:59.907
Monthly remittances, on average, to Somalia

00:08:59.907 --> 00:09:02.219
is larger than that amount.

00:09:02.219 --> 00:09:04.853
Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia.

00:09:04.853 --> 00:09:08.574
And yet, this is an example of

00:09:08.574 --> 00:09:10.445
the right hand giving a lot of aid,

00:09:10.445 --> 00:09:14.463
while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood

00:09:14.463 --> 00:09:20.064
to that economy, through regulations.

00:09:20.064 --> 00:09:24.972
Then there is the case of poor people
from villages, like me.

00:09:24.972 --> 00:09:26.988
In the villages, the only place where you can

00:09:26.988 --> 00:09:29.720
get money is through the post office.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.713
Most of the governments in the world

00:09:31.713 --> 00:09:34.729
have allowed their post offices to have

00:09:34.729 --> 00:09:37.965
exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies.

00:09:37.965 --> 00:09:40.787
So, if I have to send money to my

00:09:40.787 --> 00:09:43.470
father in the village, I must send money

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.773
through that particular money transfer company,

00:09:45.773 --> 00:09:47.013
even if the cost is high.

00:09:47.013 --> 00:09:51.325
I cannot go to a cheaper option.

00:09:51.325 --> 00:09:53.334
This has to go.

00:09:53.334 --> 00:09:55.585
So, what can international organizations and

00:09:55.585 --> 00:09:57.602
social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost

00:09:57.602 --> 00:09:59.231
of sending money home?

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:05.539
First, relax regulations on small remittances
under 1,000 dollars.

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:07.961
Governments should recognize that

00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:12.208
small remittances are not money laundering.

00:10:12.208 --> 00:10:16.647
Second, governments should abolish exclusive partnerships

00:10:16.647 --> 00:10:19.641
between their post office and the money 
transfer company.

00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:21.230
For that matter, between the post office

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.257
and any national banking system that

00:10:23.257 --> 00:10:26.337
has a large network that serves the poor.

00:10:26.337 --> 00:10:29.621
In fact, they should promote competition,

00:10:29.621 --> 00:10:32.650
open up the partnership so that

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.799
we will bring down costs like we did,

00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:39.275
like they did, in the telecommunications industry.

00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:42.272
You have seen what has happened there.

00:10:42.272 --> 00:10:47.075
Third, large nonprofit philanthropic organizations

00:10:47.075 --> 00:10:49.285
should create a remittance platform

00:10:49.285 --> 00:10:50.868
on a nonprofit basis.

00:10:50.868 --> 00:10:51.940
They should create a nonprofit

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.140
remittance platform to serve the money transfer

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.869
companies so that they can send money at a low cost,

00:10:57.869 --> 00:11:00.020
while complying with all the complex

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.732
regulations all over the world.

00:11:04.732 --> 00:11:06.134
The development community should

00:11:06.134 --> 00:11:08.411
set a goal of reducing remittance costs

00:11:08.411 --> 00:11:11.664
to one percent from the current eight percent.

00:11:11.664 --> 00:11:13.924
If we reduce costs to one percent,

00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:18.193
that would release a saving of 
30 billion dollars per year.

00:11:18.193 --> 00:11:22.594
Thirty billion dollars, that's 
larger than the entire

00:11:22.594 --> 00:11:25.743
bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year.

00:11:25.743 --> 00:11:28.759
That is larger than, or almost similar to,

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:31.928
the total aid budget of the United States government,

00:11:31.928 --> 00:11:34.784
the largest donor on the planet.

00:11:34.784 --> 00:11:36.409
Actually, the savings would be larger

00:11:36.409 --> 00:11:38.532
than that 30 billion because remittance channels

00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:43.939
are also used for aid, trade and investment purposes.

00:11:43.939 --> 00:11:46.410
Another major impediment to the

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.664
flow of remittances reaching the family

00:11:48.664 --> 00:11:51.229
is the large and exorbitant

00:11:51.229 --> 00:11:54.207
and illegal cost of recruitment,

00:11:54.207 --> 00:11:57.145
fees that migrants pay, migrant workers

00:11:57.145 --> 00:12:00.409
pay to laborers who found them the job.

00:12:00.409 --> 00:12:04.015
I was in Dubai a few years ago.

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:06.290
I visited a camp for workers.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:11.603
It was 8 in the evening, dark, hot, humid.

00:12:11.603 --> 00:12:13.415
Workers were coming back from

00:12:13.415 --> 00:12:15.886
their grueling day of work,

00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:17.670
and I struck a conversation

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.530
with a Bangladeshi construction worker.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.439
He was preoccupied that he is sending

00:12:23.439 --> 00:12:24.956
money home, he has been

00:12:24.956 --> 00:12:27.866
sending money home for a few months now,

00:12:27.866 --> 00:12:29.369
and the money is mostly going

00:12:29.369 --> 00:12:32.021
to the recruitment agent, to the labor agent

00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:33.664
who found him that job.

00:12:33.664 --> 00:12:37.408
And in my mind, I could picture

00:12:37.408 --> 00:12:38.589
the wife waiting for

00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:40.315
the monthly remittance.

00:12:40.315 --> 00:12:42.080
The remittance arrives.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.809
She takes the money and hands

00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:47.379
it over to the recruitment agent,

00:12:47.379 --> 00:12:50.375
while the children are looking on.

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:53.705
This has to stop.

00:12:53.705 --> 00:12:58.521
It is not only construction 
workers from Bangladesh,

00:12:58.521 --> 00:13:00.227
it is all the workers. There are millions of migrant

00:13:00.227 --> 00:13:03.178
workers who suffer from this problem.

00:13:03.178 --> 00:13:04.855
A construction worker from Bangladesh,

00:13:04.855 --> 00:13:08.650
on an average, pays about 4,000 
dollars in recruitment fees

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:14.029
for a job that gives him only 2,000 
dollars per year in income.

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:16.759
That means that for the two years or three years

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:20.252
of his life, he is basically sending money

00:13:20.252 --> 00:13:21.536
to pay for the recruitment fees.

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:25.049
The family doesn't get to see any of it.

00:13:25.049 --> 00:13:28.820
It is not only Dubai, it is the dark

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.394
underbelly of every major city in the world.

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.892
It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers,

00:13:33.892 --> 00:13:36.047
it is workers from all over the world.

00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:37.985
It is not only men.

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:39.870
Women are especially vulnerable to

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.408
recruitment malpractices.

00:13:43.408 --> 00:13:48.002
One of the most exciting and newest

00:13:48.002 --> 00:13:50.420
thing happening in the area of remittances

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.461
is how to mobilize, through innovation,

00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:56.652
diaspora saving and diaspora giving.

00:13:56.652 --> 00:13:58.535
Migrants send money home,

00:13:58.535 --> 00:14:00.168
but they also save a large amount of

00:14:00.168 --> 00:14:02.613
money where they live.

00:14:02.613 --> 00:14:05.248
Annually, migrant savings are estimated

00:14:05.248 --> 00:14:09.349
to be 500 billion dollars.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.577
Most of that money is parked in

00:14:11.577 --> 00:14:15.302
bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate.

00:14:15.302 --> 00:14:18.394
If a country were to come 
and offer a three percent

00:14:18.394 --> 00:14:20.905
or four percent interest rate, and then say

00:14:20.905 --> 00:14:23.709
that the money would be used for building schools,

00:14:23.709 --> 00:14:26.844
roads, airports, train systems

00:14:26.844 --> 00:14:28.656
in the country of origin, a lot

00:14:28.656 --> 00:14:30.593
of migrants would be interested in

00:14:30.593 --> 00:14:32.983
parting with their money because

00:14:32.983 --> 00:14:34.778
it's not only financial gains that

00:14:34.778 --> 00:14:36.067
give them an opportunity

00:14:36.067 --> 00:14:41.539
to stay engaged with their country's development.

00:14:41.539 --> 00:14:43.480
Remittance channels can be used

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:48.051
to sell these bonds to migrants

00:14:48.051 --> 00:14:49.402
because when they come

00:14:49.402 --> 00:14:50.985
on a monthly basis to send remittances,

00:14:50.985 --> 00:14:53.566
that's when you can actually sell
it to them.

00:14:53.566 --> 00:14:54.539
You can also do the same

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:57.320
for mobilizing diaspora giving.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.158
I would love to invest in a

00:15:00.158 --> 00:15:02.538
bullet train system in India

00:15:02.538 --> 00:15:05.440
and I would love to contribute to efforts

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.356
to fight malaria in my village.

00:15:09.356 --> 00:15:13.345
Remittances are a great way of

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:17.116
sharing prosperity between places

00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:19.412
in a targeted way that benefits

00:15:19.412 --> 00:15:22.348
those who need them most.

00:15:22.348 --> 00:15:25.506
Remittances empower people.

00:15:25.506 --> 00:15:28.614
We must do all we can to make remittances

00:15:28.614 --> 00:15:29.599
and recruitment

00:15:29.599 --> 00:15:31.751
safer and cheaper.

00:15:31.751 --> 00:15:34.862
And it can be done.

00:15:34.862 --> 00:15:36.962
As for myself, I have been

00:15:36.962 --> 00:15:40.982
away from India for two decades now.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.015
My wife is a Venezuelan.

00:15:43.015 --> 00:15:46.913
My children are Americans.

00:15:46.913 --> 00:15:50.860
Increasingly, I feel like a global citizen.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.190
And yet, I am growing nostalgic

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.142
about my country of birth.

00:15:56.142 --> 00:16:01.338
I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time.

00:16:01.338 --> 00:16:03.561
My parents are not there anymore.

00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:07.063
My brothers and sisters have moved on.

00:16:07.063 --> 00:16:09.597
There is no real urgency for me to send money home.

00:16:09.597 --> 00:16:12.219
And yet, from time to time,

00:16:12.219 --> 00:16:15.070
I send money home to friends,

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.911
to relatives, to the village,

00:16:17.911 --> 00:16:20.147
to be there, to stay engaged â€”

00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:22.195
that's part of my identity.

00:16:22.195 --> 00:16:25.435
And, I'm still striving to be a poet

00:16:25.435 --> 00:16:27.803
for the hardworking migrants

00:16:27.803 --> 00:16:29.340
and their struggle to break free

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.628
of the cycle of poverty.

00:16:30.628 --> 00:16:32.402
Thank you.

00:16:32.402 --> 00:16:38.846
(Applause)
