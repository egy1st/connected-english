WEBVTT

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:04.955
Fifty-four percent of the world's population

00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:07.536
lives in our cities.

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:09.181
In developing countries,

00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:11.461
one third of that population

00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.408
is living in slums.

00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:19.040
Seventy-five percent of global energy consumption

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.090
occurs in our cities,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.599
and 80 percent of gas emissions

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.354
that cause global warming

00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:29.392
come from our cities.

00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:32.417
So things that you and I might think about

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:34.532
as global problems,

00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:37.180
like climate change, the energy crisis

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.842
or poverty,

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:43.702
are really, in many ways, city problems.

00:00:43.702 --> 00:00:45.564
They will not be solved

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:48.582
unless people who live in cities,

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.501
like most of us,

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:53.293
actually start doing a better job,

00:00:53.293 --> 00:00:57.249
because right now, we are 
not doing a very good one.

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.585
And that becomes very clear

00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:04.479
when we look into three aspects of city life:

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.605
first, our citizens' willingness to engage

00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:11.417
with democratic institutions;

00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:16.221
second, our cities' ability to really include

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.763
all of their residents;

00:01:18.763 --> 00:01:21.940
and lastly, our own ability

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.405
to live fulfilling and happy lives.

00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:28.184
When it comes to engagement,

00:01:28.184 --> 00:01:31.114
the data is very clear.

00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:33.195
Voter turnout around the world

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:35.636
peaked in the late '80s,

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.481
and it has been declining at a pace

00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:40.543
that we have never seen before,

00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:44.138
and if those numbers are bad at the national level,

00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:46.147
at the level of our cities,

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:49.236
they are just dismal.

00:01:49.236 --> 00:01:50.830
In the last two years,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.331
two of the world's most consolidated,

00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:57.166
oldest democracies, the U.S. and France,

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:00.971
held nationwide municipal elections.

00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:04.871
In France, voter turnout hit a record low.

00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:08.933
Almost 40 percent of voters decided

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:11.621
not to show up.

00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:14.710
In the U.S., the numbers were even scarier.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.987
In some American cities,

00:02:16.987 --> 00:02:21.981
voter turnout was close to five percent.

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:23.770
I'll let that sink in for a second.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.188
We're talking about democratic cities

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:29.563
in which 95 percent of people

00:02:29.563 --> 00:02:31.981
decided that it was not important

00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:34.726
to elect their leaders.

00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:38.380
The city of L.A., a city of four million people,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.309
elected its mayor with just a bit over 200,000 votes.

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:45.795
That was the lowest turnout the city had seen

00:02:45.795 --> 00:02:48.676
in 100 years.

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:51.720
Right here, in my city of Rio,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.794
in spite of mandatory voting,

00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:58.292
almost 30 percent of the voting population

00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:00.857
chose to either annul their votes

00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:03.489
or stay home and pay a fine

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.820
in the last mayoral elections.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.139
When it comes to inclusiveness,

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.244
our cities are not the best cases of success either,

00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:15.134
and again, you don't need to look very far

00:03:15.134 --> 00:03:16.889
in order to find proof of that.

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.388
The city of Rio is incredibly unequal.

00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:23.357
This is Leblon.

00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:26.461
Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood.

00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:28.900
And this is Complexo do Alemão.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.164
This is where over 70,000

00:03:31.164 --> 00:03:34.415
of the city's poorest residents live.

00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:38.001
Leblon has an HDI, a Human Development Index,

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:41.390
of .967.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.211
That is higher than Norway, Switzerland

00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:47.452
or Sweden.

00:03:47.452 --> 00:03:51.181
Complexo do Alemão has an HDI of .711.

00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:54.111
It sits somewhere in between the HDI

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:57.328
of Algeria and Gabon.

00:03:57.328 --> 00:04:02.109
So Rio, like so many cities across the global South,

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.080
is a place where you can go from northern Europe

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.980
to sub-Saharan Africa

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.984
in the space of 30 minutes.

00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:11.693
If you drive, that is.

00:04:11.693 --> 00:04:16.440
If you take public transit, it's about two hours.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.299
And lastly, perhaps most importantly,

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.780
cities, with the incredible wealth

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.282
of relations that they enable,

00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:29.160
could be the ideal places for human happiness

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.562
to flourish.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.987
We like being around people.

00:04:32.987 --> 00:04:35.383
We are social animals.

00:04:35.383 --> 00:04:38.006
Instead, countries where urbanization

00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:42.228
has already peaked seem to be the very countries

00:04:42.228 --> 00:04:46.880
in which cities have stopped making us happy.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.484
The United States population has suffered

00:04:49.484 --> 00:04:52.464
from a general decrease in happiness

00:04:52.464 --> 00:04:55.666
for the past three decades,

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:58.640
and the main reason is this.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.542
The American way of building cities

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:04.253
has caused good quality public spaces

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:06.237
to virtually disappear in many,

00:05:06.237 --> 00:05:07.992
many American cities,

00:05:07.992 --> 00:05:09.989
and as a result, they have seen

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:12.544
a decline of relations,

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:14.748
of the things that make us happy.

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.795
Many studies show an increase

00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:21.486
in solitude and a decrease in solidarity,

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:26.142
honesty, and social and civic participation.

00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:29.506
So how do we start building cities

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:32.116
that make us care?

00:05:32.116 --> 00:05:36.750
Cities that value their most important asset:

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.349
the incredible diversity

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.555
of the people who live in them?

00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:45.212
Cities that make us happy?

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:47.719
Well, I believe that if we want to change

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.271
what our cities look like,

00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:52.961
then we really have to change

00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:55.504
the decision-making processes

00:05:55.504 --> 00:05:59.328
that have given us the results 
that we have right now.

00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:02.500
We need a participation revolution,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.374
and we need it fast.

00:06:05.374 --> 00:06:10.712
The idea of voting as our 
only exercise in citizenship

00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:13.670
does not make sense anymore.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.199
People are tired of only being treated

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.372
as empowered individuals every few years

00:06:20.372 --> 00:06:23.522
when it's time to delegate that power

00:06:23.522 --> 00:06:25.897
to someone else.

00:06:25.897 --> 00:06:28.842
If the protests that swept Brazil

00:06:28.842 --> 00:06:33.814
in June 2013 have taught us anything,

00:06:33.814 --> 00:06:36.649
it's that every time we try

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:39.101
to exercise our power

00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:41.958
outside of an electoral context,

00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:47.212
we are beaten up, humiliated or arrested.

00:06:47.212 --> 00:06:50.419
And this needs to change,

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.633
because when it does,

00:06:52.633 --> 00:06:54.894
not only will people re-engage

00:06:54.894 --> 00:06:57.380
with the structures of representation,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.654
but also complement these structures

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:07.572
with direct, effective, and 
collective decision making,

00:07:07.572 --> 00:07:09.496
decision making of the kind

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:11.542
that attacks inequality

00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:14.782
by its very inclusive nature,

00:07:14.782 --> 00:07:16.605
decision making of the kind

00:07:16.605 --> 00:07:18.821
that can change our cities

00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:21.937
into better places for us to live.

00:07:21.937 --> 00:07:25.416
But there is a catch, obviously:

00:07:25.416 --> 00:07:28.157
Enabling widespread participation

00:07:28.157 --> 00:07:30.115
and redistributing power

00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:32.840
can be a logistical nightmare,

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.129
and there's where technology can play

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:37.306
an incredibly helpful role,

00:07:37.306 --> 00:07:40.388
by making it easier for people to organize,

00:07:40.388 --> 00:07:42.452
communicate and make decisions

00:07:42.452 --> 00:07:44.690
without having to be in the same room

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.952
at the same time.

00:07:46.952 --> 00:07:48.853
Unfortunately for us,

00:07:48.853 --> 00:07:51.879
when it comes to fostering democratic processes,

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:54.964
our city governments have not used technology

00:07:54.964 --> 00:07:57.942
to its full potential.

00:07:57.942 --> 00:08:01.159
So far, most city governments have been effective

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:05.742
at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors

00:08:05.742 --> 00:08:09.450
who serve authorities with data on the city:

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.456
potholes, fallen trees or broken lamps.

00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:15.886
They have also, to a lesser extent,

00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:19.486
invited people to participate in improving

00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:21.100
the outcome of decisions

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.412
that were already made for them,

00:08:24.412 --> 00:08:25.987
just like my mom when I was eight

00:08:25.987 --> 00:08:27.753
and she told me that I had a choice:

00:08:27.753 --> 00:08:29.330
I had to be in bed by 8 p.m.,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.243
but I could choose my pink
pajamas or my blue pajamas.

00:08:33.243 --> 00:08:35.482
That's not participation,

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:39.227
and in fact, governments have not been very good

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:42.130
at using technology to enable participation

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.080
on what matters —

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.393
the way we allocate our budget,

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:48.615
the way we occupy our land,

00:08:48.615 --> 00:08:52.164
and the way we manage our natural resources.

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:54.278
Those are the kinds of decisions

00:08:54.278 --> 00:08:57.158
that can actually impact global problems

00:08:57.158 --> 00:09:00.980
that manifest themselves in our cities.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.506
The good news is,

00:09:02.506 --> 00:09:04.369
and I do have good news to share with you,

00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:08.666
we don't need to wait for governments to do this.

00:09:08.666 --> 00:09:10.636
I have reason to believe

00:09:10.636 --> 00:09:13.224
that it's possible for citizens to build

00:09:13.224 --> 00:09:17.757
their own structures of participation.

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:20.558
Three years ago, I cofounded an organization

00:09:20.558 --> 00:09:23.045
called Meu Rio,

00:09:23.045 --> 00:09:26.125
and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio

00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:29.704
to organize around causes and places

00:09:29.704 --> 00:09:32.301
that they care about in their own city,

00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:34.990
and have an impact on those causes and places

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.318
every day.

00:09:37.318 --> 00:09:40.060
In these past three years, Meu Rio grew

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.928
to a network of 160,000 citizens of Rio.

00:09:45.928 --> 00:09:49.833
About 40 percent of those 
members are young people

00:09:49.833 --> 00:09:52.072
aged 20 to 29.

00:09:52.072 --> 00:09:56.996
That is one in every 15 young people

00:09:56.996 --> 00:10:00.828
of that age in Rio today.

00:10:00.828 --> 00:10:04.460
Amongst our members is this adorable little girl,

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.509
Bia, to your right,

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:09.636
and Bia was just 11 years old

00:10:09.636 --> 00:10:12.572
when she started a campaign using one of our tools

00:10:12.572 --> 00:10:16.161
to save her model public school from demolition.

00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:18.253
Her school actually ranks among the best

00:10:18.253 --> 00:10:20.525
public schools in the country,

00:10:20.525 --> 00:10:22.257
and it was going to be demolished

00:10:22.257 --> 00:10:24.811
by the Rio de Janeiro state government

00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:26.701
to build, I kid you not,

00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:29.524
a parking lot for the World Cup

00:10:29.524 --> 00:10:31.870
right before the event happened.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.364
Bia started a campaign, and we even watched

00:10:34.364 --> 00:10:37.747
her school 24/7 through webcam monitoring,

00:10:37.747 --> 00:10:39.761
and many months afterwards,

00:10:39.761 --> 00:10:41.392
the government changed their minds.

00:10:41.392 --> 00:10:44.316
Bia's school stayed in place.

00:10:44.316 --> 00:10:46.487
There's also Jovita.

00:10:46.487 --> 00:10:48.759
She's an amazing woman whose daughter

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:51.420
went missing about 10 years ago,

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.855
and since then, she has been looking

00:10:53.855 --> 00:10:55.039
for her daughter.

00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:57.815
In that process, she found out

00:10:57.815 --> 00:11:00.368
that first, she was not alone.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.956
In the last year alone, 2013,

00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:04.830
6,000 people disappeared

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.706
in the state of Rio.

00:11:06.706 --> 00:11:09.334
But she also found out that in spite of that,

00:11:09.334 --> 00:11:13.285
Rio had no centralized intelligence system

00:11:13.285 --> 00:11:16.590
for solving missing persons cases.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.160
In other Brazilian cities, those systems

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.550
have helped solve up to 80 percent

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.586
of missing persons cases.

00:11:23.586 --> 00:11:25.329
She started a campaign,

00:11:25.329 --> 00:11:29.311
and after the secretary of 
security got 16,000 emails

00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:32.124
from people asking him to do this,

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:35.106
he responded, and started to build a police unit

00:11:35.106 --> 00:11:36.930
specializing in those cases.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.286
It was open to the public at the end of last month,

00:11:40.286 --> 00:11:42.137
and Jovita was there

00:11:42.137 --> 00:11:45.161
giving interviews and being very fancy.

00:11:45.161 --> 00:11:47.000
And then, there is Leandro.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.723
Leandro is an amazing guy

00:11:48.723 --> 00:11:50.639
in a slum in Rio,

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:54.062
and he created a recycling project in the slum.

00:11:54.062 --> 00:11:56.512
At the end of last year, December 16,

00:11:56.512 --> 00:11:58.604
he received an eviction order

00:11:58.604 --> 00:12:00.584
by the Rio de Janeiro state government

00:12:00.584 --> 00:12:04.504
giving him two weeks to leave the space

00:12:04.504 --> 00:12:08.244
that he had been using for two years.

00:12:08.244 --> 00:12:10.809
The plan was to hand it over to a developer,

00:12:10.809 --> 00:12:14.229
who planned to turn it into a construction site.

00:12:14.229 --> 00:12:17.297
Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools,

00:12:17.297 --> 00:12:18.875
the Pressure Cooker,

00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:21.214
the same one that Bia and Jovita used,

00:12:21.214 --> 00:12:24.270
and the state government changed their minds

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.536
before Christmas Eve.

00:12:27.536 --> 00:12:30.608
These stories make me happy,

00:12:30.608 --> 00:12:33.655
but not just because they have happy endings.

00:12:33.655 --> 00:12:36.401
They make me happy because they are

00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:39.100
happy beginnings.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.519
The teacher and parent community at Bia's school

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:43.475
is looking for other ways they could improve

00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:46.952
that space even further.

00:12:46.952 --> 00:12:48.663
Leandro has ambitious plans

00:12:48.663 --> 00:12:51.616
to take his model to other
low-income communities in Rio,

00:12:51.616 --> 00:12:54.827
and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit

00:12:54.827 --> 00:12:57.667
that she helped created.

00:12:57.667 --> 00:13:00.415
Bia, Jovita and Leandro

00:13:00.415 --> 00:13:02.475
are living examples of something

00:13:02.475 --> 00:13:06.057
that citizens and city 
governments around the world

00:13:06.057 --> 00:13:08.461
need to know:

00:13:08.461 --> 00:13:11.788
We are ready.

00:13:11.788 --> 00:13:14.716
As citizens, we are ready

00:13:14.716 --> 00:13:18.271
to decide on our common destinies,

00:13:18.271 --> 00:13:22.290
because we know that the way we distribute power

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:27.130
says a lot about how we actually value everyone,

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.360
and because we know

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.855
that enabling and participating in local politics

00:13:32.855 --> 00:13:34.978
is a sign that we truly care

00:13:34.978 --> 00:13:37.168
about our relations to one another,

00:13:37.168 --> 00:13:38.890
and we are ready to do this

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.907
in cities around the world right now.

00:13:42.907 --> 00:13:45.303
With the Our Cities network,

00:13:45.303 --> 00:13:46.640
the Meu Rio team

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.666
hopes to share what we have learned

00:13:48.666 --> 00:13:50.622
with other people who want to create

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:53.884
similar initiatives in their own cities.

00:13:53.884 --> 00:13:56.441
We have already started doing it in São Paulo

00:13:56.441 --> 00:13:58.137
with incredible results,

00:13:58.137 --> 00:14:01.444
and want to take it to cities around the world

00:14:01.444 --> 00:14:04.369
through a network of citizen-centric,

00:14:04.369 --> 00:14:06.746
citizen-led organizations

00:14:06.746 --> 00:14:08.932
that can inspire us,

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:12.396
challenge us, and remind us to demand

00:14:12.396 --> 00:14:17.447
real participation in our city lives.

00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:19.409
It is up to us

00:14:19.409 --> 00:14:21.894
to decide whether we want schools

00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:24.180
or parking lots,

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.513
community-driven recycling projects

00:14:26.513 --> 00:14:29.116
or construction sites,

00:14:29.116 --> 00:14:31.536
loneliness or solidarity, cars or buses,

00:14:31.536 --> 00:14:35.235
and it is our responsibility to do that now,

00:14:35.235 --> 00:14:38.659
for ourselves, for our families,

00:14:38.659 --> 00:14:42.753
for the people who make our lives worth living,

00:14:42.753 --> 00:14:45.620
and for the incredible creativity,

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.027
beauty, and wonder that make our cities,

00:14:49.027 --> 00:14:51.614
in spite of all of their problems,

00:14:51.614 --> 00:14:55.330
the greatest invention of our time.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.810
Obrigado. Thank you.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.081
(Applause)
