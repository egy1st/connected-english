WEBVTT

00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:06.170
So imagine that a plane is about to crash

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.971
with 250 children and babies,

00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:12.390
and if you knew how to stop that, would you?

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.361
Now imagine

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:18.000
that 60 planes full of babies under five

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.210
crash every single day.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.982
That's the number of kids

00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:25.307
that never make it to their fifth birthday.

00:00:25.307 --> 00:00:28.547
6.6 million children

00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:32.138
never make it to their fifth birthday.

00:00:32.138 --> 00:00:34.594
Most of these deaths are preventable,

00:00:34.594 --> 00:00:36.562
and that doesn't just make me sad,

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:38.258
it makes me angry,

00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:40.616
and it makes me determined.

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:42.506
Diarrhea and pneumonia

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:44.322
are among the top two killers

00:00:44.322 --> 00:00:46.640
of children under five,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.896
and what we can do to prevent these diseases

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:51.076
isn't some smart,

00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:53.993
new technological innovations.

00:00:53.993 --> 00:00:58.872
It's one of the world's oldest inventions:

00:00:58.872 --> 00:01:02.397
a bar of soap.

00:01:02.397 --> 00:01:03.829
Washing hands with soap,

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.200
a habit we all take for granted,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.484
can reduce diarrhea by half,

00:01:08.484 --> 00:01:12.140
can reduce respiratory infections by one third.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.911
Handwashing with soap

00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:15.560
can have an impact

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.587
on reducing flu, trachoma, SARS,

00:01:20.587 --> 00:01:22.977
and most recently in the case of cholera

00:01:22.977 --> 00:01:25.667
and Ebola outbreak,

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:27.358
one of the key interventions

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:30.176
is handwashing with soap.

00:01:30.176 --> 00:01:33.431
Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school.

00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:36.254
It stops babies from dying.

00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:38.127
Handwashing with soap

00:01:38.127 --> 00:01:40.924
is one of the most cost-effective

00:01:40.924 --> 00:01:43.470
ways of saving children's lives.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.126
It can save over 600,000 children every year.

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:50.090
That's the equivalent of stopping

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.070
10 jumbo jets

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.998
full of babies and children

00:01:53.998 --> 00:01:56.709
from crashing every single day.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.133
I think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.415
useful public health intervention.

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:05.365
So now just take a minute.

00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:07.301
I think you need to get to
know the person next to you.

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:09.249
Why don't you just shake their hands.

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.493
Please shake their hands.

00:02:11.493 --> 00:02:12.793
All right, get to know each other.

00:02:12.793 --> 00:02:14.328
They look really pretty.

00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:16.101
All right.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.399
So what if I told you

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.984
that the person whose hands you just shook

00:02:20.984 --> 00:02:22.692
actually didn't wash their hands

00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:25.350
when they were coming out of the toilet?
(Laughter)

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.680
They don't look so pretty anymore, right?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.836
Pretty yucky, you would agree with me.

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:33.501
Well, statistics are actually showing

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:35.917
that four people out of five

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:38.525
don't wash their hands when
they come out of the toilet,

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.213
globally.

00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:42.483
And the same way,

00:02:42.483 --> 00:02:45.227
we don't do it when we've got fancy toilets,

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:47.677
running water, and soap available,

00:02:47.677 --> 00:02:49.611
it's the same thing in the countries

00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:52.985
where child mortality is really high.

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:55.299
What is it? Is there no soap?

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.548
Actually, soap is available.

00:02:57.548 --> 00:03:01.203
In 90 percent of households in India,

00:03:01.203 --> 00:03:03.883
94 percent of households in Kenya,

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:05.363
you will find soap.

00:03:05.363 --> 00:03:09.200
Even in countries where soap is the lowest,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.779
like Ethiopia, we are at 50 percent.

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:14.006
So why is it?

00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:16.939
Why aren't people washing their hands?

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.323
Why is it that Mayank,

00:03:19.323 --> 00:03:21.590
this young boy that I met in India,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.335
isn't washing his hands?

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:25.947
Well, in Mayank's family,

00:03:25.947 --> 00:03:28.379
soap is used for bathing,

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.371
soap is used for laundry,

00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:33.240
soap is used for washing dishes.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.107
His parents think sometimes

00:03:35.107 --> 00:03:36.671
it's a precious commodity,

00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:38.938
so they'll keep it in a cupboard.

00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:41.692
They'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it.

00:03:41.692 --> 00:03:44.242
On average, in Mayank's family,

00:03:44.242 --> 00:03:46.314
they will use soap for washing hands

00:03:46.314 --> 00:03:47.765
once a day

00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:50.130
at the very best, and sometimes

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.115
even once a week for washing hands with soap.

00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:55.330
What's the result of that?

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.195
Children pick up disease

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.870
in the place that's supposed to love them

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.778
and protect them the most, in their homes.

00:04:03.778 --> 00:04:06.326
Think about where you learned to wash your hands.

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:09.130
Did you learn to wash your hands at home?

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.906
Did you learn to wash your hands in school?

00:04:11.906 --> 00:04:14.386
I think behavioral scientists will tell you

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:16.925
that it's very difficult to change the habits

00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:21.810
that you have had early in life.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.607
However, we all copy what everyone else does,

00:04:24.607 --> 00:04:27.331
and local cultural norms are something

00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:30.642
that shape how we change our behavior,

00:04:30.642 --> 00:04:33.418
and this is where the private sector comes in.

00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:37.218
Every second in Asia and Africa,

00:04:37.218 --> 00:04:40.140
111 mothers

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.858
will buy this bar to protect their family.

00:04:43.858 --> 00:04:45.898
Many women in India will tell you

00:04:45.898 --> 00:04:48.124
they learned all about hygiene, diseases,

00:04:48.124 --> 00:04:51.870
from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.745
Iconic brands like this one

00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:55.633
have a responsibility to do good

00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:58.114
in the places where they sell their products.

00:04:58.114 --> 00:05:01.289
It's that belief, plus the scale of Unilever,

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.729
that allows us to keep talking about

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.545
handwashing with soap and
hygiene to these mothers.

00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:10.817
Big businesses and brands can change

00:05:10.817 --> 00:05:12.969
and shift those social norms

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:14.881
and make a difference for those habits

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:17.061
that are so stubborn.

00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:18.319
Think about it:

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.824
Marketeers spend all their time

00:05:21.824 --> 00:05:26.180
making us switch from one brand to the other.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.170
And actually, they know how to transform

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.203
science and facts into compelling messages.

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:34.099
Just for a minute, imagine

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.840
when they put all their forces behind

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.790
a message as powerful as handwashing with soap.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.749
The profit motive is transforming health outcomes

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:44.627
in this world.

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:46.446
But it's been happening for centuries:

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:49.979
the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.715
in Victorian England

00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:53.987
to actually combat cholera.

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:56.291
Last week, I was in Ghana

00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:57.830
with the minister of health,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.049
because if you don't know,

00:05:59.049 --> 00:06:01.706
there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.

00:06:01.706 --> 00:06:03.842
A hundred and eighteen years later,

00:06:03.842 --> 00:06:05.762
the solution is exactly the same:

00:06:05.762 --> 00:06:08.258
It's about ensuring that they have access

00:06:08.258 --> 00:06:09.674
to this bar of soap,

00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:11.419
and that they're using it,

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.379
because that's the number one way

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.610
to actually stop cholera from spreading.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.010
I think this drive for profit

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.881
is extremely powerful,

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.341
sometimes more powerful than

00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:25.636
the most committed charity or government.

00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:27.438
Government is doing what they can,

00:06:27.438 --> 00:06:30.813
especially in terms of the pandemics

00:06:30.813 --> 00:06:33.350
and epidemics such as cholera,

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.805
or Ebola at the moment,

00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:37.345
but with competing priorities.

00:06:37.345 --> 00:06:39.850
The budget is not always there.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.713
And when you think about this,

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:43.820
you think about what is required

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.141
to make handwashing a daily habit,

00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:49.962
it requires sustained funding

00:06:49.962 --> 00:06:53.070
to refine this behavior.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.503
In short, those that fight for public health

00:06:57.503 --> 00:07:00.267
are actually dependent upon the soap companies

00:07:00.267 --> 00:07:03.263
to keep promoting handwashing with soap.

00:07:03.263 --> 00:07:06.505
We have friends like USAID,

00:07:06.505 --> 00:07:09.810
the Global Public-Private Partnership
for Handwashing with Soap,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.970
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.539
Plan, WaterAid,

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:15.046
that all believe

00:07:15.046 --> 00:07:18.761
for a win-win-win partnership.

00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:20.746
Win for the public sector,

00:07:20.746 --> 00:07:23.821
because we help them reach their targets.

00:07:23.821 --> 00:07:26.209
Win for the private sector,

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:27.623
because we build new generations

00:07:27.623 --> 00:07:29.420
of future handwashers.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.633
And most importantly,

00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:34.240
win for the most vulnerable.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.296
On October 15,

00:07:36.296 --> 00:07:38.648
we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day.

00:07:38.648 --> 00:07:40.368
Schools, communities,

00:07:40.368 --> 00:07:42.248
our friends in the public sector

00:07:42.248 --> 00:07:44.864
and our friends in the private sector —

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:47.144
yes, on that day even our competitors,

00:07:47.144 --> 00:07:49.130
we all join hands to celebrate

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.112
the world's most important

00:07:51.112 --> 00:07:53.160
public health intervention.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.385
What's required,

00:07:54.385 --> 00:07:57.121
and again where the private sector
can make a huge difference,

00:07:57.121 --> 00:08:00.887
is coming up with this big, creative thinking

00:08:00.887 --> 00:08:03.128
that drives advocacy.

00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:05.791
If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign,

00:08:05.791 --> 00:08:08.770
we've created great films

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.856
that bring the message of handwashing with soap

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:12.551
to the everyday person

00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:15.127
in a way that can relate to them.

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.887
We've had over 30 million views.

00:08:16.887 --> 00:08:19.414
Most of these discussions are still happening online.

00:08:19.414 --> 00:08:20.886
I urge you to take five minutes

00:08:20.886 --> 00:08:24.943
and look at those films.

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:26.472
I come from Mali,

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:28.815
one of the world's poorest countries.

00:08:28.815 --> 00:08:31.551
I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation

00:08:31.551 --> 00:08:33.729
was around social justice.

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:37.257
I trained in Europe's premier school of public health.

00:08:37.257 --> 00:08:38.985
I think I'm probably one of the only women

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:42.426
in my country with this high degree in health,

00:08:42.426 --> 00:08:43.910
and the only one

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.512
with a doctorate in handwashing with soap.

00:08:47.512 --> 00:08:49.248
(Laughter)

00:08:49.248 --> 00:08:53.460
(Applause)

00:08:55.872 --> 00:08:58.223
Nine years ago, I decided,

00:08:58.223 --> 00:09:01.136
with a successful public health career in the making,

00:09:01.136 --> 00:09:04.664
that I could make the biggest impact coming,

00:09:04.664 --> 00:09:07.695
selling and promoting the world's best invention

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:10.230
in public health: soap.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.359
We run today the world's largest

00:09:12.359 --> 00:09:13.730
handwashing program

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.308
by any public health standards.

00:09:16.308 --> 00:09:19.780
We've reached over 183 million people

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.970
in 16 countries.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.806
My team and I have the ambition

00:09:24.806 --> 00:09:28.564
to reach one billion by 2020.

00:09:28.564 --> 00:09:30.758
Over the last four years,

00:09:30.758 --> 00:09:33.486
business has grown double digits,

00:09:33.486 --> 00:09:35.423
whilst child mortality has reduced

00:09:35.423 --> 00:09:39.845
in all the places where soap use has increased.

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:42.150
It may be uncomfortable for some to hear —

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.405
business growth and lives saved

00:09:44.405 --> 00:09:47.918
somehow equated in the same sentence —

00:09:47.918 --> 00:09:49.837
but it is that business growth

00:09:49.837 --> 00:09:52.133
that allows us to keep doing more.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.877
Without it, and without talking about it,

00:09:54.877 --> 00:09:58.925
we cannot achieve the change that we need.

00:09:58.925 --> 00:10:01.110
Last week, my team and I

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.406
spent time visiting mothers

00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:06.917
that have all experienced the same thing:

00:10:06.917 --> 00:10:09.349
the death of a newborn.

00:10:09.349 --> 00:10:12.349
I'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful

00:10:12.349 --> 00:10:15.262
and more painful.

00:10:15.262 --> 00:10:17.894
This one is from Myanmar.

00:10:17.894 --> 00:10:19.900
She had the most beautiful smile,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.110
the smile, I think, that life gives you

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.497
when you've had a second chance.

00:10:24.497 --> 00:10:27.831
Her son, Myo, is her second one.

00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:29.735
She had a daughter

00:10:29.735 --> 00:10:32.127
who passed away at three weeks,

00:10:32.127 --> 00:10:34.480
and we know that the majority

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.820
of children that actually die

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.686
die in the first month of their life,

00:10:37.686 --> 00:10:40.554
and we know that if we give a bar of soap

00:10:40.554 --> 00:10:42.814
to every skilled birth attendant,

00:10:42.814 --> 00:10:45.364
and that if soap is used 
before touching the babies,

00:10:45.364 --> 00:10:46.606
we can reduce and make a change

00:10:46.606 --> 00:10:48.650
in terms of those numbers.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.518
And that's what inspires me,

00:10:50.518 --> 00:10:52.750
inspires me to continue in this mission,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.134
to know that I can equip her

00:10:55.134 --> 00:10:56.939
with what's needed

00:10:56.939 --> 00:10:58.790
so that she can do

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.854
the most beautiful job in the world:

00:11:00.854 --> 00:11:02.980
nurturing her newborn.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.285
And next time you think of a gift

00:11:05.285 --> 00:11:07.375
for a new mom and her family,

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:10.165
don't look far: buy her soap.

00:11:10.165 --> 00:11:13.373
It's the most beautiful invention in public health.

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:15.749
I hope you will join us

00:11:15.749 --> 00:11:18.701
and make handwashing part of your daily lives

00:11:18.701 --> 00:11:20.405
and our daily lives

00:11:20.405 --> 00:11:22.629
and help more children like Myo

00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:23.757
reach their fifth birthday.

00:11:23.757 --> 00:11:26.164
Thank you.

00:11:26.164 --> 00:11:28.378
(Applause)
