00:00:00.691 --> 00:00:02.036
Almost a year ago,

00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:04.897
my aunt started suffering back pains.

00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:06.262
She went to see the doctor

00:00:06.262 --> 00:00:08.511
and they told her it was a normal injury

00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:10.165
for someone who had been playing tennis

00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:12.190
for almost 30 years.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.158
They recommended that she do some therapy,

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:17.253
but after a while she wasn't feeling better,

00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:20.593
so the doctors decided to do further tests.

00:00:20.593 --> 00:00:21.592
They did an x-ray

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:23.681
and discovered an injury in her lungs,

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.238
and at the time they thought that the injury

00:00:25.238 --> 00:00:26.796
was a strain in the muscles and tendons

00:00:26.796 --> 00:00:27.966
between her ribs,

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.735
but after a few weeks of treatment,

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:33.793
again her health wasn't getting any better.

00:00:33.793 --> 00:00:37.483
So finally, they decided to do a biopsy,

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:38.700
and two weeks later,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.443
the results of the biopsy came back.

00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:46.212
It was stage 3 lung cancer.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:49.114
Her lifestyle was almost free of risk.

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:50.847
She never smoked a cigarette,

00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:52.613
she never drank alcohol,

00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:53.715
and she had been playing sports

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:55.897
for almost half her life.

00:00:55.897 --> 00:00:59.073
Perhaps, that is why it took them almost six months

00:00:59.073 --> 00:01:02.197
to get her properly diagnosed.

00:01:02.197 --> 00:01:04.300
My story might be, unfortunately,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.539
familiar to most of you.

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.240
One out of three people sitting in this audience

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.166
will be diagnosed with some type of cancer,

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.312
and one out of four

00:01:13.312 --> 00:01:16.910
will die because of it.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.992
Not only did that cancer diagnosis

00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:20.859
change the life of our family,

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:22.872
but that process of going

00:01:22.872 --> 00:01:25.480
back and forth with new tests,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.248
different doctors describing symptoms,

00:01:27.248 --> 00:01:30.420
discarding diseases over and over,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.800
was stressful and frustrating,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.712
especially for my aunt.

00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:37.423
And that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done

00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:39.763
since the beginning of history.

00:01:39.763 --> 00:01:42.609
We have 21st-century medical treatments and drugs

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.172
to treat cancer,

00:01:44.172 --> 00:01:46.714
but we still have 20th-century procedures

00:01:46.714 --> 00:01:50.842
and processes for diagnosis, if any.

00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:53.486
Today, most of us have to wait for symptoms

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:55.953
to indicate that something is wrong.

00:01:55.953 --> 00:01:58.470
Today, the majority of people still don't have access

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.888
to early cancer detection methods,

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.260
even though we know

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.184
that catching cancer early

00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:05.647
is basically the closest thing we have

00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:09.127
to a silver bullet cure against it.

00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:11.608
We know that we can change this in our lifetime,

00:02:11.608 --> 00:02:13.160
and that is why my team and I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.354
have decided to begin this journey,

00:02:15.354 --> 00:02:17.860
this journey to try to make cancer detection

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.405
at the early stages

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:22.557
and monitoring the appropriate 
response at the molecular level

00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:26.819
easier, cheaper, smarter

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.276
and more accessible than ever before.

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:31.648
The context, of course,

00:02:31.648 --> 00:02:33.191
is that we're living at a time

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:34.600
where technology is disrupting our present

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.107
at exponential rates,

00:02:36.107 --> 00:02:39.117
and the biological realm is no exception.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.547
It is said today that biotech is advancing

00:02:41.547 --> 00:02:43.842
at least six times faster than the growth rate

00:02:43.842 --> 00:02:46.218
of the processing power of computers.

00:02:46.218 --> 00:02:47.530
But progress in biotech

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.170
is not only being accelerated,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.216
it is also being democratized.

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:54.428
Just as personal computers or the Internet

00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:56.879
or smartphones leveled the playing field

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.736
for entrepreneurship, politics or education,

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:03.156
recent advances have leveled it
up for biotech progress as well,

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:04.449
and that is allowing

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:06.564
multidisciplinary teams like ours

00:03:06.564 --> 00:03:09.219
to try to tackle and look at these problems

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.570
with new approaches.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.193
We are a team of scientists and technologists

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:17.183
from Chile, Panama,

00:03:17.183 --> 00:03:20.570
Mexico, Israel and Greece,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.192
and based on recent scientific discoveries,

00:03:23.192 --> 00:03:24.574
we believe that we have found

00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:27.375
a reliable and accurate way

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:29.377
of detecting several types of cancer

00:03:29.377 --> 00:03:32.275
at the very early stages through a blood sample.

00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:35.223
We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules

00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:36.892
that circulate freely in our blood

00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:39.688
called microRNAs.

00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:41.999
To explain what microRNAs are

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.214
and their important role in cancer,

00:03:44.214 --> 00:03:45.607
I need to start with proteins,

00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:48.160
because when cancer is present in our body,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.591
protein modification is observed

00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:51.202
in all cancerous cells.

00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:52.575
As you might know,

00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:54.850
proteins are large biological molecules

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.190
that perform different functions within our body,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.275
like catalyzing metabolic reactions

00:03:59.275 --> 00:04:01.121
or responding to stimuli

00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:02.923
or replicating DNA,

00:04:02.923 --> 00:04:05.666
but before a protein is expressed or produced,

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:07.364
relevant parts of its genetic code

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:09.513
present in the DNA

00:04:09.513 --> 00:04:13.482
are copied into the messenger RNA,

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:15.392
so this messenger RNA

00:04:15.392 --> 00:04:19.106
has instructions on how to build a specific protein,

00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:21.706
and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins,

00:04:21.706 --> 00:04:24.303
but the one that tells them when to build them

00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:26.632
and how many to build

00:04:26.632 --> 00:04:29.070
are microRNAs.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.900
So microRNAs are small molecules

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.100
that regulate gene expression.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.315
Unlike DNA, which is mainly fixed,

00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:37.464
microRNAs can vary depending on internal

00:04:37.464 --> 00:04:40.321
and environmental conditions at any given time,

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:43.775
telling us which genes are actively 
expressed at that particular moment.

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.194
And that is what makes microRNAs

00:04:45.194 --> 00:04:47.495
such a promising biomarker for cancer,

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.377
because as you know,

00:04:49.377 --> 00:04:53.190
cancer is a disease of altered gene expression.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.744
It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes.

00:04:56.744 --> 00:04:58.398
Another important thing to consider

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.817
is that no two cancers are the same,

00:05:00.817 --> 00:05:03.865
but at the microRNA level, there are patterns.

00:05:03.865 --> 00:05:06.115
Several scientific studies have shown

00:05:06.115 --> 00:05:09.456
that abnormal microRNA expression levels

00:05:09.456 --> 00:05:12.571
varies and creates a unique, specific pattern

00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:14.259
for each type of cancer,

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:15.991
even at the early stages,

00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:17.881
reflecting the progression of the disease,

00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:19.782
and whether it's responding to medication

00:05:19.782 --> 00:05:20.990
or in remission,

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.123
making microRNAs a perfect,

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:26.727
highly sensitive biomarker.

00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:29.401
However, the problem with microRNAs

00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:31.950
is that we cannot use existing DNA-based technology

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.563
to detect them in a reliable way,

00:05:34.563 --> 00:05:37.353
because they are very short sequences of nucleotides,

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:39.535
much smaller than DNA.

00:05:39.535 --> 00:05:42.550
And also, all microRNAs are
very similar to each other,

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.597
with just tiny differences.

00:05:44.597 --> 00:05:47.117
So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules,

00:05:47.117 --> 00:05:50.311
extremely similar, extremely small.

00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:53.217
We believe that we have found a way to do so,

00:05:53.217 --> 00:05:55.966
and this is the first time that we've shown it in public.

00:05:55.966 --> 00:05:58.467
Let me do a demonstration.

00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:00.908
Imagine that next time you go to your doctor

00:06:00.908 --> 00:06:02.831
and do your next standard blood test,

00:06:02.831 --> 00:06:05.183
a lab technician extracts a total RNA,

00:06:05.183 --> 00:06:07.106
which is quite simple today,

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:09.898
and puts it in a standard 
96-well plate like this one.

00:06:09.898 --> 00:06:11.565
Each well of these plates

00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:14.204
has specific biochemistry that we assign,

00:06:14.204 --> 00:06:16.544
that is looking for a specific microRNA,

00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:18.323
acting like a trap that closes

00:06:18.323 --> 00:06:20.680
only when the microRNA is present in the sample,

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.801
and when it does, it will shine with green color.

00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:24.904
To run the reaction,

00:06:24.904 --> 00:06:28.040
you put the plate inside a device like this one,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.930
and then you can put your smartphone on top of it.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.670
If we can have a camera here

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.378
so you can see my screen.

00:06:37.378 --> 00:06:39.774
A smartphone is a connected computer

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.383
and it's also a camera,

00:06:41.383 --> 00:06:43.531
good enough for our purpose.

00:06:47.431 --> 00:06:49.411
The smartphone is taking pictures,

00:06:49.411 --> 00:06:50.755
and when the reaction is over,

00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:51.798
it will send the pictures

00:06:51.798 --> 00:06:54.112
to our online database for processing

00:06:54.112 --> 00:06:55.730
and interpretation.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.455
This entire process lasts around 60 minutes,

00:06:58.455 --> 00:07:00.300
but when the process is over,

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.325
wells that shine are matched 
with the specific microRNAs

00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:05.969
and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:07.218
they shine.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:11.486
And then, when this entire process is over,

00:07:11.486 --> 00:07:13.944
this is what happens.

00:07:13.944 --> 00:07:16.541
This chart is showing the specific microRNAs

00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:17.976
present in this sample

00:07:17.976 --> 00:07:20.388
and how they reacted over time.

00:07:20.388 --> 00:07:22.890
Then, if we take this specific pattern of microRNA

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.296
of this person's samples

00:07:24.296 --> 00:07:27.272
and compare it with existing scientific documentation

00:07:27.272 --> 00:07:29.220
that correlates microRNA patterns

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.501
with a specific presence of a disease,

00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:37.950
this is how pancreatic cancer looks like.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.607
This inside is a real sample

00:07:40.607 --> 00:07:43.926
where we just detected pancreatic cancer.

00:07:43.926 --> 00:07:48.365
(Applause)

00:07:52.086 --> 00:07:54.444
Another important aspect of this approach

00:07:54.444 --> 00:07:56.783
is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud,

00:07:56.783 --> 00:07:58.426
so we can get results in real time

00:07:58.426 --> 00:08:01.863
and analyze them with our contextual information.

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:03.341
If we want to better understand

00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:05.456
and decode diseases like cancer,

00:08:05.456 --> 00:08:06.806
we need to stop treating them

00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:08.988
as acute, isolated episodes,

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.912
and consider and measure everything

00:08:10.912 --> 00:08:15.220
that affects our health on a permanent basis.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.506
This entire platform is a working prototype.

00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:22.971
It uses state-of-the-art molecular biology,

00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:25.717
a low-cost, 3D-printed device,

00:08:25.717 --> 00:08:27.679
and data science

00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:31.594
to try to tackle one of humanity's 
toughest challenges.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.596
Since we believe early cancer detection

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.384
should really be democratized,

00:08:35.384 --> 00:08:37.769
this entire solution costs at least 50 times less

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:39.770
than current available methods,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.503
and we know that the community can help us

00:08:41.503 --> 00:08:42.988
accelerate this even more,

00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:44.923
so we're making the design of the device

00:08:44.923 --> 00:08:47.400
open-source.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.994
(Applause)

00:08:55.944 --> 00:08:57.541
Let me say very clearly

00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:59.276
that we are at the very early stages,

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:01.257
but so far, we have been able

00:09:01.257 --> 00:09:03.866
to successfully identify the microRNA pattern

00:09:03.866 --> 00:09:07.128
of pancreatic cancer, lung cancer,

00:09:07.128 --> 00:09:10.188
breast cancer and hepatic cancer.

00:09:10.188 --> 00:09:13.370
And currently, we're doing a clinical trial

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.249
in collaboration with the
German Cancer Research Center

00:09:16.249 --> 00:09:19.840
with 200 women for breast cancer.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.448
(Applause)

00:09:23.448 --> 00:09:26.162
This is the single non-invasive,

00:09:26.162 --> 00:09:28.904
accurate and affordable test

00:09:28.904 --> 00:09:31.150
that has the potential to dramatically change

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.960
how cancer procedures and diagnostics

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.780
have been done.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.397
Since we're looking for the microRNA patterns

00:09:36.397 --> 00:09:38.962
in your blood at any given time,

00:09:38.962 --> 00:09:40.858
you don't need to know
which cancer you're looking for.

00:09:40.858 --> 00:09:43.025
You don't need to have any symptoms.

00:09:43.025 --> 00:09:45.833
You only need one milliliter of blood

00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:49.343
and a relatively simple array of tools.

00:09:49.343 --> 00:09:52.155
Today, cancer detection happens mainly

00:09:52.155 --> 00:09:54.240
when symptoms appear.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.869
That is, at stage 3 or 4,

00:09:56.869 --> 00:09:58.793
and I believe that is too late.

00:09:58.793 --> 00:10:00.941
It is too expensive for our families.

00:10:00.941 --> 00:10:03.393
It is too expensive for humanity.

00:10:03.393 --> 00:10:06.340
We cannot lose the war against cancer.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.230
It not only costs us billions of dollars,

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.152
but it also costs us the people we love.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:14.650
Today, my aunt, she's fighting bravely

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.560
and going through this process
with a very positive attitude.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.138
However, I want fights like this

00:10:20.138 --> 00:10:21.761
to become very rare.

00:10:21.761 --> 00:10:22.888
I want to see the day

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:24.815
when cancer is treated easily

00:10:24.815 --> 00:10:26.967
because it can be routinely diagnosed

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:28.924
at the very early stages,

00:10:28.924 --> 00:10:30.016
and I'm certain

00:10:30.016 --> 00:10:32.152
that in the very near future,

00:10:32.152 --> 00:10:33.450
because of this

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.690
and other breakthroughs that we are seeing

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.713
every day in the life sciences,

00:10:36.713 --> 00:10:38.345
the way we see cancer

00:10:38.345 --> 00:10:40.336
will radically change.

00:10:40.336 --> 00:10:42.800
It will give us the chance of detecting it early,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.565
understanding it better,

00:10:44.565 --> 00:10:46.801
and finding a cure.

00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:48.480
Thank you very much.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:56.688
(Applause)
