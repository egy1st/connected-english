WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is your conference,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, I'm just going to grab a chair here.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Two years ago at TED, I think --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I've come to this conclusion --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I think that I may have believed unconsciously,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
then, that I was kind of a business hero.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I had this company that I'd spent 15 years building. It's called Future;

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it was a magazine publishing company.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It had recently gone public

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
a number I didn't really understand.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
A magazine I'd recently launched called Business 2.0

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
was fatter than a telephone directory,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
busy pumping hot air into the bubble.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
(Laughter)

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And all this had come from nothing.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Fifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
when I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine."

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And 15 years later, there are 100 of them

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The date was February 2000.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I thought the little graph of my business life

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The dotcom, ironically called Snowball,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
was the very last consumer web company to go public

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the next month before NASDAQ exploded, and I entered 18 months of business hell.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I watched everything that I'd built crumbling,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and it looked like all this stuff was going to die

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and 15 years work would have come for nothing.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And it was gut wrenching.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It took eight years of blood, sweat and tears to reach 350 employees,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
something which I was very proud of in the business.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
February 2001 -- in one day we laid off 350 people,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and before the bloodshed was finished, 1,000 people had lost their jobs

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
from my companies. I felt sick.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I watched my own net worth falling

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
by about a million dollars a day, every day, for 18 months.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And worse than that, far worse than that,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I was going around with this big sign on my forehead: "LOSER."

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
(Laughter)

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And I think what disgusts me more than anything, looking back,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
is how the hell did I let my personal happiness

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
get so tied up with this business thing?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Well, in the end, we were able to save Future and Snowball,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
but I was, at that point, ready to move on.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And to cut a long story short, here's where I came to.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe, from many conversations,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
emotional rollercoaster -- in the last couple years.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This has been a big, big transition time,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
The theme next year is re-birth.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
It was at the same TED two years ago

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And at about the same time, and I think partly because of that,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus:

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I started to read again.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest:

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to ... all this stuff had changed.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And the way in which you could think about us as a species

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And what was really most exciting --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
was that all this stuff is connected.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
It's connected; it all hooks into each other.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
We talk about this a lot,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example:

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Madame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
was famously asked once, "What do you most desire?"

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And she answered, "A penis."

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And when you think about it, it's very true:

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
what we all most desire is a penis --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
or "happiness" as we say in English.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.000
(Laughter)

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
(Laughter)

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
(Applause)

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But something as basic as happiness,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
in the church or mosque or synagogue,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
that you can ask about it, which are really interesting.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
You can ask about what causes it biochemically:

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
neuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
You can ask what are the psychological causes of it:

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
nature? Nurture? Current circumstance?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
You can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem:

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
do you need to incorporate

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and say, why is it that a billion people on this planet

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and whereas almost all the rest of them,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
regardless of how much money they have -- whether it's two dollars a day or whatever --

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
are almost equally happy on average?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing:

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
did our genes invent this as a kind of trick

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
to get us to behave in certain ways? The ant's brain, parasitized,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Are we the victims of a mass delusion?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And so on, and so on.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
To understand even something as important to us as happiness,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and there's nowhere that I've discovered -- other than TED --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And so, it's the profound thing that Richard talks about:

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
to understand anything, you just need to understand the little bits;

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
a little bit about everything that surrounds it.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And so, gradually over these three days,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
you start off kind of trying to figure out,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
"Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff?"

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And at the end of the four days,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
your brain is humming and you feel energized, alive and excited,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and it's because all these different bits have been put together.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
It's the total brain experience, we're going to ...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
(Laughter)

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Every mental organ addressed. It really is.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Enough of the theory, Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do, all right?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So, I will. Here's the vision for TED.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Number one: do nothing. This thing ain't broke, so I ain't gonna fix it.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
"Chris, TED is a really great conference.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad."

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
(Laughter)

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and I will promise you right here and now

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Truth, curiosity, diversity, no selling, no corporate bullshit,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
no bandwagoning, no platforms.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Just the pursuit of interest, wherever it lies,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
across all the disciplines that are represented here.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
That's not going to be changed at all.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Number two: I am going to put together

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
an incredible line up of speakers for next year.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
There's a year to do this, and already --

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I hope to show you a bit later --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
there's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And I'm getting fantastic help from the community;

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
this is just such a great community. And combined, our contacts

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It's true.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Number three: I do want to, if I can, find a way

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Books kind of saved me in the last couple years,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and that's a gift that I would like to pass on.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
They may well be by a TED speaker,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and so we can get the conversation going during the year

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I think it will be great.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And then, fourthly: I want to mention the Sapling Foundation,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
which is the new owner of TED.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
will go towards the causes that Sapling stands for.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And more important, I think, the ideas that are exhibited and realized here

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
are ideas that the foundation can use, because there's fantastic synergy.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Already, just in the last few days,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and the idea of getting this group of people together --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
some of the causes that we believe in,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
the money that this conference can raise and the ideas --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I'm incredibly excited about that.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.000
In fact, I don't think, overall, that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I'm in this for the long run,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and I would be greatly honored and excited

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
if you'll come on this journey with me.
