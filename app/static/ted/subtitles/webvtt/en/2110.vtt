WEBVTT

00:00:00.812 --> 00:00:02.449
So I started working

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:04.333
with refugees because I wanted

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.673
to make a difference,

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.080
and making a difference starts

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.436
with telling their stories.

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:11.926
So when I meet refugees,

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:14.726
I always ask them questions.

00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:17.044
Who bombed your house?

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:19.697
Who killed your son?

00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:23.741
Did the rest of your family make it out alive?

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:25.727
How are you coping

00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:28.258
in your life in exile?

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:31.261
But there's one question that always seems to me

00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:33.725
to be most revealing, and that is:

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:35.907
What did you take?

00:00:35.907 --> 00:00:38.157
What was that most important thing

00:00:38.157 --> 00:00:40.229
that you had to take with you

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:43.635
when the bombs were exploding in your town,

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:48.060
and the armed gangs were approaching your house?

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.665
A Syrian refugee boy I know

00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:53.355
told me that he didn't hesitate

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:57.145
when his life was in imminent danger.

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:00.126
He took his high school diploma,

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.055
and later he told me why.

00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:05.263
He said, "I took my high school diploma

00:01:05.263 --> 00:01:08.469
because my life depended on it."

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.698
And he would risk his life to get that diploma.

00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:15.380
On his way to school, he would dodge snipers.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.895
His classroom sometimes shook

00:01:17.895 --> 00:01:21.129
with the sound of bombs and shelling,

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:23.936
and his mother told me,

00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:27.005
"Every day, I would say to him every morning,

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.931
'Honey, please don't go to school.'"

00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:33.390
And when he insisted, she said,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.362
"I would hug him as if it were for the last time."

00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:39.392
But he said to his mother,

00:01:39.392 --> 00:01:41.237
"We're all afraid,

00:01:41.237 --> 00:01:44.128
but our determination to graduate

00:01:44.128 --> 00:01:47.462
is stronger than our fear."

00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:50.798
But one day, the family got terrible news.

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:53.532
Hany's aunt, his uncle and his cousin

00:01:53.532 --> 00:01:56.221
were murdered in their homes for refusing

00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:57.215
to leave their house.

00:01:57.215 --> 00:02:00.080
Their throats were slit.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.711
It was time to flee.

00:02:02.711 --> 00:02:05.725
They left that day, right away, in their car,

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.586
Hany hidden in the back because they were facing

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:11.496
checkpoints of menacing soldiers.

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:15.208
And they would cross the border into Lebanon,

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:17.904
where they would find peace.

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:21.586
But they would begin a life of grueling hardship

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:24.590
and monotony.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.289
They had no choice but to build a shack

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:28.622
on the side of a muddy field,

00:02:28.622 --> 00:02:30.940
and this is Hany's brother Ashraf,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.678
who plays outside.

00:02:32.678 --> 00:02:35.100
And that day, they joined

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.304
the biggest population of refugees in the world,

00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:43.330
in a country, Lebanon, that is tiny.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.981
It only has four million citizens,

00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:49.551
and there are one million Syrian refugees living there.

00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:53.645
There's not a town, a city or a village

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:58.392
that is not host to Syrian refugees.

00:02:58.392 --> 00:03:01.587
This is generosity and humanity

00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:05.961
that is remarkable.

00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:08.955
Think about it this way, proportionately.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.711
It would be as if

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:13.702
the entire population of Germany,

00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:15.567
80 million people,

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:20.957
would flee to the United States in just three years.

00:03:20.957 --> 00:03:24.118
Half of the entire population of Syria

00:03:24.118 --> 00:03:26.548
is now uprooted,

00:03:26.548 --> 00:03:28.303
most of them inside the country.

00:03:28.303 --> 00:03:30.598
Six and a half million people

00:03:30.598 --> 00:03:33.320
have fled for their lives.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.210
Over and well over three million people

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.932
have crossed the borders

00:03:37.932 --> 00:03:41.475
and have found sanctuary
in the neighboring countries,

00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:44.400
and only a small proportion, as you see,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.534
have moved on to Europe.

00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:51.205
What I find most worrying

00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:55.131
is that half of all Syrian refugees are children.

00:03:55.131 --> 00:03:57.369
I took this picture of this little girl.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.294
It was just two hours after she had arrived

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:04.636
after a long trek from Syria into Jordan.

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:08.061
And most troubling of all

00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:11.802
is that only 20 percent of 
Syrian refugee children

00:04:11.802 --> 00:04:15.277
are in school in Lebanon.

00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:18.210
And yet, Syrian refugee children,

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.508
all refugee children tell us

00:04:20.508 --> 00:04:25.574
education is the most important thing in their lives.

00:04:25.574 --> 00:04:29.755
Why? Because it allows them to think of their future

00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:33.150
rather than the nightmare of their past.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.784
It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred.

00:04:38.784 --> 00:04:40.813
I'm reminded of a recent visit I took

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:44.390
to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq,

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.202
and I met this girl,

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:47.979
and I thought, "She's beautiful,"

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.686
and I went up to her and asked her,

00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:51.634
"Can I take your picture?"

00:04:51.634 --> 00:04:53.333
And she said yes,

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:56.370
but she refused to smile.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.419
I think she couldn't,

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.925
because I think she must realize that she represents

00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:07.369
a lost generation of Syrian refugee children,

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:11.950
a generation isolated and frustrated.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.496
And yet, look at what they fled:

00:05:15.496 --> 00:05:17.335
utter destruction,

00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:22.914
buildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.

00:05:22.914 --> 00:05:25.593
Hany's home was also destroyed.

00:05:25.593 --> 00:05:28.806
This will need to be rebuilt

00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:33.637
by architects, by engineers, by electricians.

00:05:33.637 --> 00:05:37.284
Communities will need teachers and lawyers

00:05:37.284 --> 00:05:41.525
and politicians interested in reconciliation

00:05:41.525 --> 00:05:44.169
and not revenge.

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:45.924
Shouldn't this be rebuilt

00:05:45.924 --> 00:05:49.015
by the people with the largest stake,

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:54.880
the societies in exile, the refugees?

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.634
Refugees have a lot of time

00:05:57.634 --> 00:05:59.880
to prepare for their return.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.595
You might imagine that being a refugee

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:05.103
is just a temporary state.

00:06:05.103 --> 00:06:08.044
Well far from it.

00:06:08.044 --> 00:06:11.560
With wars going on and on,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.362
the average time a refugee will spend in exile

00:06:15.362 --> 00:06:18.827
is 17 years.

00:06:18.827 --> 00:06:22.415
Hany was into his second year in limbo

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:24.789
when I went to visit him recently,

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.546
and we conducted our entire conversation in English,

00:06:28.546 --> 00:06:30.435
which he confessed to me he learned

00:06:30.435 --> 00:06:34.089
from reading all of Dan Brown's novels

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:38.444
and from listening to American rap.

00:06:38.444 --> 00:06:41.189
We also spent some nice moments of laughter

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:45.823
and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.

00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:47.444
But I'll never forget what he told me

00:06:47.444 --> 00:06:50.868
when we ended our conversation that day.

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:53.281
He said to me,

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:58.810
"If I am not a student, I am nothing."

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.527
Hany is one of 50 million people

00:07:02.527 --> 00:07:06.105
uprooted in this world today.

00:07:06.105 --> 00:07:08.884
Never since World War II

00:07:08.884 --> 00:07:14.151
have so many people been forcibly displaced.

00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:16.780
So while we're making sweeping progress

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.881
in human health,

00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:23.875
in technology, in education and design,

00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:27.238
we are doing dangerously little

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:30.546
to help the victims

00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:33.245
and we are doing far too little

00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:35.281
to stop and prevent

00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:38.690
the wars that are driving them from their homes.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.133
And there are more and more victims.

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:46.267
Every day, on average,

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:48.449
by the end of this day,

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:52.297
32,000 people will be forcibly displaced

00:07:52.297 --> 00:07:54.332
from their homes —

00:07:54.332 --> 00:07:57.244
32,000 people.

00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:03.020
They flee across borders like this one.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.715
We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan,

00:08:06.715 --> 00:08:09.675
and this is a typical day.

00:08:13.588 --> 00:08:18.492
Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats,

00:08:18.492 --> 00:08:20.292
risking their lives in this case

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:22.923
just to reach safety in Europe.

00:08:22.923 --> 00:08:24.638
This Syrian young man

00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:27.424
survived one of these boats that capsized —

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.047
most of the people drowned —

00:08:29.047 --> 00:08:31.262
and he told us,

00:08:31.262 --> 00:08:35.421
"Syrians are just looking for a quiet place

00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:38.290
where nobody hurts you,

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.832
where nobody humiliates you,

00:08:40.832 --> 00:08:43.543
and where nobody kills you."

00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:46.761
Well, I think that should be the minimum.

00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:49.888
How about a place of healing,

00:08:49.888 --> 00:08:51.766
of learning,

00:08:51.766 --> 00:08:55.160
and even opportunity?

00:08:56.832 --> 00:08:58.856
Americans and Europeans

00:08:58.856 --> 00:09:02.107
have the impression that proportionally

00:09:02.107 --> 00:09:04.480
huge numbers of refugees are coming

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.500
to their country,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.642
but the reality is

00:09:08.642 --> 00:09:12.287
that 86 percent, the vast majority of refugees,

00:09:12.287 --> 00:09:14.967
are living in the developing world,

00:09:14.967 --> 00:09:19.520
in countries struggling with their own insecurity,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.539
with their own issues of helping their own populations

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:25.662
and poverty.

00:09:25.662 --> 00:09:28.935
So wealthy countries in the world should recognize

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:32.636
the humanity and the generosity of the countries

00:09:32.636 --> 00:09:36.754
that are hosting so many refugees.

00:09:36.754 --> 00:09:40.386
And all countries should make sure that no one

00:09:40.386 --> 00:09:42.939
fleeing war and persecution

00:09:42.939 --> 00:09:46.652
arrives at a closed border.

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:49.282
(Applause)

00:09:49.282 --> 00:09:52.519
Thank you.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.505
But there is something more that we can do

00:09:56.505 --> 00:10:00.915
than just simply helping refugees survive.

00:10:00.915 --> 00:10:04.446
We can help them thrive.

00:10:04.446 --> 00:10:07.506
We should think of refugee camps and communities

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:11.713
as more than just temporary population centers

00:10:11.713 --> 00:10:13.873
where people languish

00:10:13.873 --> 00:10:16.782
waiting for the war to end.

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:20.511
Rather, as centers of excellence,

00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:24.459
where refugees can triumph over their trauma

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:27.643
and train for the day that they can go home

00:10:27.643 --> 00:10:30.724
as agents of positive change

00:10:30.724 --> 00:10:35.122
and social transformation.

00:10:35.122 --> 00:10:37.508
It makes so much sense,

00:10:37.508 --> 00:10:41.817
but I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia

00:10:41.817 --> 00:10:45.741
that has been raging on for 22 years.

00:10:45.741 --> 00:10:48.250
And imagine living in this camp.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.823
I visited this camp.

00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:51.700
It's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.244
and it was so remote

00:10:54.244 --> 00:10:56.685
that we had to take a helicopter to fly there.

00:10:56.685 --> 00:11:00.131
It was dusty and it was terribly hot.

00:11:00.131 --> 00:11:02.425
And we went to visit a school

00:11:02.425 --> 00:11:04.342
and started talking to the children,

00:11:04.342 --> 00:11:06.936
and then I saw this girl across the room

00:11:06.936 --> 00:11:08.785
who looked to me to be the same age

00:11:08.785 --> 00:11:12.066
as my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.

00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:13.610
And I asked her the questions

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.789
that grown-ups ask kids,

00:11:15.789 --> 00:11:17.712
like, "What is your favorite subject?"

00:11:17.712 --> 00:11:20.367
and, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:23.664
And this is when her face turned blank,

00:11:23.664 --> 00:11:25.714
and she said to me,

00:11:25.714 --> 00:11:28.185
"I have no future.

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:31.162
My schooling days are over."

00:11:31.162 --> 00:11:32.810
And I thought, there must be some misunderstanding,

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.119
so I turned to my colleague

00:11:35.119 --> 00:11:37.217
and she confirmed to me

00:11:37.217 --> 00:11:39.910
there is no funding for secondary education

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.180
in this camp.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.649
And how I wished at that moment

00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:45.967
that I could say to her,

00:11:45.967 --> 00:11:48.372
"We will build you a school."

00:11:48.372 --> 00:11:52.546
And I also thought, what a waste.

00:11:52.546 --> 00:11:55.594
She should be and she is

00:11:55.594 --> 00:11:59.925
the future of Somalia.

00:11:59.925 --> 00:12:03.131
A boy named Jacob Atem

00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:06.326
had a different chance, but not before he experienced

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:08.418
terribly tragedy.

00:12:08.418 --> 00:12:10.882
He watched — this is in Sudan —

00:12:10.882 --> 00:12:13.176
as his village — he was only seven years old —

00:12:13.176 --> 00:12:15.558
burned to the ground, and he learned

00:12:15.558 --> 00:12:17.397
that his mother and his father

00:12:17.397 --> 00:12:19.386
and his entire family

00:12:19.386 --> 00:12:21.250
were killed that day.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.040
Only his cousin survived, and the two of them

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.320
walked for seven months —

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.170
this is boys like him —

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.378
chased and pursued by wild
animals and armed gangs,

00:12:30.378 --> 00:12:32.738
and they finally made it to refugee camps

00:12:32.738 --> 00:12:34.271
where they found safety,

00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:36.394
and he would spend the next seven years

00:12:36.394 --> 00:12:39.581
in Kenya in a refugee camp.

00:12:39.581 --> 00:12:42.109
But his life changed

00:12:42.109 --> 00:12:44.212
when he got the chance to be resettled

00:12:44.212 --> 00:12:46.417
to the United States,

00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:49.113
and he found love in a foster family

00:12:49.113 --> 00:12:51.701
and he was able to go to school,

00:12:51.701 --> 00:12:53.995
and he wanted me to share with you

00:12:53.995 --> 00:12:55.563
this proud moment

00:12:55.563 --> 00:12:57.868
when he graduated from university.

00:12:57.868 --> 00:13:01.810
(Applause)

00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:06.243
I spoke to him on Skype the other day,

00:13:06.243 --> 00:13:11.237
and he was in his new university in Florida

00:13:11.237 --> 00:13:14.236
pursuing his Ph.D. in public health,

00:13:14.236 --> 00:13:17.306
and he proudly told me how he was able to raise

00:13:17.306 --> 00:13:19.990
enough funds from the American public

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.575
to establish a health clinic back in his village

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:27.655
back home.

00:13:27.655 --> 00:13:30.939
So I want to take you back to Hany.

00:13:30.939 --> 00:13:33.160
When I told him I was going to have the chance

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.877
to speak to you here on the TED stage,

00:13:35.877 --> 00:13:38.172
he allowed me to read you a poem

00:13:38.172 --> 00:13:41.532
that he sent in an email to me.

00:13:41.532 --> 00:13:44.449
He wrote:

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.830
"I miss myself,

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.335
my friends,

00:13:50.335 --> 00:13:54.590
times of reading novels or writing poems,

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:59.515
birds and tea in the morning.

00:13:59.515 --> 00:14:04.464
My room, my books, myself,

00:14:04.464 --> 00:14:10.122
and everything that was making me smile.

00:14:10.122 --> 00:14:14.250
Oh, oh, I had so many dreams

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.796
that were about to be realized."

00:14:19.323 --> 00:14:21.551
So here is my point:

00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:23.597
Not investing in refugees

00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:29.241
is a huge missed opportunity.

00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:31.092
Leave them abandoned,

00:14:31.092 --> 00:14:36.439
and they risk exploitation and abuse,

00:14:36.439 --> 00:14:39.712
and leave them unskilled and uneducated,

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:42.265
and delay by years the return

00:14:42.265 --> 00:14:48.115
to peace and prosperity in their countries.

00:14:48.115 --> 00:14:51.399
I believe how we treat the uprooted

00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:55.972
will shape the future of our world.

00:14:55.972 --> 00:14:58.926
The victims of war can hold the keys

00:14:58.926 --> 00:15:01.447
to lasting peace,

00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:03.256
and it's the refugees

00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:06.923
who can stop the cycle of violence.

00:15:06.923 --> 00:15:09.944
Hany is at a tipping point.

00:15:09.944 --> 00:15:12.209
We would love to help him go to university

00:15:12.209 --> 00:15:15.269
and to become an engineer,

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:19.116
but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life:

00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:23.163
tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets,

00:15:23.163 --> 00:15:27.519
food rations and a bit of medicine.

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:30.916
University is a luxury.

00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:35.253
But leave him to languish in this muddy field,

00:15:35.253 --> 00:15:37.214
and he will become a member

00:15:37.214 --> 00:15:40.636
of a lost generation.

00:15:40.636 --> 00:15:45.340
Hany's story is a tragedy,

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.073
but it doesn't have to end that way.

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:51.450
Thank you.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.045
(Applause)
