00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:05.125
I experienced my first coup d'état at the age of four.

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.835
Because of the coup d'état,

00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:09.962
my family had to leave my native home of Ghana

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:12.178
and move to the Gambia.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.899
As luck would have it,

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:15.632
six months after we arrived,

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:18.703
they too had a military coup.

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:21.121
I vividly remember being woken
up in the middle of the night

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.348
and gathering the few belongings we could

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:26.297
and walking for about two hours

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:28.343
to a safe house.

00:00:28.343 --> 00:00:31.175
For a week, we slept under our beds

00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:35.956
because we were worried that bullets
might fly through the window.

00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:38.138
Then, at the age of eight,

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.265
we moved to Botswana.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:42.458
This time, it was different.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:44.292
There were no coups.

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:47.335
Everything worked. Great education.

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:50.310
They had such good infrastructure
that even at the time they had

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.211
a fiber-optic telephone system,

00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:55.260
long before it had reached Western countries.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.349
The only thing they didn't have

00:00:59.349 --> 00:01:00.679
is that they didn't have

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.329
their own national television station,

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.220
and so I remember watching

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.705
TV from neighboring South Africa,

00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:10.326
and watching Nelson Mandela in jail

00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:12.621
being offered a chance to come out

00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:15.501
if he would give up the apartheid struggle.

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:16.616
But he didn't. He refused to do that

00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:18.464
until he actually achieved his objective

00:01:18.464 --> 00:01:21.676
of freeing South Africa from apartheid.

00:01:21.676 --> 00:01:25.709
And I remember feeling how just one good leader

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:30.557
could make such a big difference in Africa.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.830
Then at the age of 12,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.170
my family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.747
Initially, this too was amazing:

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:44.933
growing economy, excellent infrastructure,

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.969
and it seemed like it was a model

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.658
for economic development in Africa.

00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:51.649
I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.070
and I went off to college.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.161
Six years later, I returned to the country.

00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:59.145
Everything was different.

00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:02.396
It had shattered into pieces.

00:02:02.396 --> 00:02:05.606
Millions of people had emigrated,

00:02:05.606 --> 00:02:07.413
the economy was in a shambles,

00:02:07.413 --> 00:02:09.004
and it seemed all of a sudden that 30 years

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.889
of development had been wiped out.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:15.377
How could a country go so bad so fast?

00:02:15.377 --> 00:02:16.990
Most people would agree

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.178
that it's all because of leadership.

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:22.958
One man, President Robert Mugabe,

00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.168
is almost single-handedly responsible

00:02:24.168 --> 00:02:27.515
for having destroyed this country.

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:29.244
Now, all these experiences of living in different

00:02:29.244 --> 00:02:31.675
parts of Africa growing up

00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:33.497
did two things to me.

00:02:33.497 --> 00:02:37.776
The first is it made me fall in love with Africa.

00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:39.699
Everywhere I went,

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.377
I experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent

00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:45.534
and saw the resilience and the spirit of our people,

00:02:45.534 --> 00:02:47.461
and at the time, I realized that I wanted to dedicate

00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:52.242
the rest of my life to making this continent great.

00:02:52.242 --> 00:02:54.144
But I also realized that making Africa great

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:57.461
would require addressing this issue of leadership.

00:02:57.461 --> 00:02:59.632
You see, all these countries I lived in,

00:02:59.632 --> 00:03:01.624
the coups d'état

00:03:01.624 --> 00:03:04.683
and the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia

00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:07.405
and in Zimbabwe,

00:03:07.405 --> 00:03:11.858
contrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:16.412
in Botswana and in South 
Africa of good leadership.

00:03:16.412 --> 00:03:20.495
It made me realize that Africa would rise or fall

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:24.174
because of the quality of our leaders.

00:03:24.174 --> 00:03:26.423
Now, one might think, of course,

00:03:26.423 --> 00:03:29.191
leadership matters everywhere.

00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:33.421
But if there's one thing you take
away from my talk today, it is this:

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:36.550
In Africa, more than anywhere else in the world,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.876
the difference that just one good leader can make

00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:43.435
is much greater than anywhere 
else, and here's why.

00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:46.225
It's because in Africa, we have weak institutions,

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:48.903
like the judiciary, the constitution,

00:03:48.903 --> 00:03:52.094
civil society and so forth.

00:03:52.094 --> 00:03:55.944
So here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in:

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.711
When societies have strong institutions,

00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:01.973
the difference that one good
leader can make is limited,

00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:04.180
but when you have weak institutions,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.910
then just one good leader

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.058
can make or break that country.

00:04:08.058 --> 00:04:11.366
Let me make it a bit more concrete.

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:14.415
You become the president of the United States.

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:16.687
You think, "Wow, I've arrived.

00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:19.750
I'm the most powerful man in the world."

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.436
So you decide, perhaps let me pass a law.

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:24.978
All of a sudden, Congress taps you on the shoulder

00:04:24.978 --> 00:04:28.111
and says, "No, no, no, no, no, you can't do that."

00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:30.820
You say, "Let me try this way."

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.273
The Senate comes and says, "Uh-uh,

00:04:32.273 --> 00:04:35.101
we don't think you can do that."

00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:37.744
You say, perhaps, "Let me print some money.

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:40.399
I think the economy needs a stimulus."

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.894
The central bank governor will think you're crazy.

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:45.000
You might get impeached for that.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.307
But if you become the president of Zimbabwe,

00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:50.440
and you say, "You know, I really like this job.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.225
I think I'd like to stay in it forever."
(Laughter)

00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:58.070
Well, you just can.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.550
You decide you want to print money.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.453
You call the central bank governor and you say,

00:05:02.453 --> 00:05:04.785
"Please double the money supply."

00:05:04.785 --> 00:05:06.226
He'll say, "Okay, yes, sir,

00:05:06.226 --> 00:05:09.770
is there anything else I can do for you?"

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.609
This is the power that African leaders have,

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:17.127
and this is why they make the most difference

00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:19.581
on the continent.

00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:21.626
The good news is that

00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:24.464
the quality of leadership in Africa has been improving.

00:05:24.464 --> 00:05:27.206
We've had three generations 
of leaders, in my mind.

00:05:27.206 --> 00:05:29.434
Generation one are those who appeared

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:30.976
in the '50s and '60s.

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:33.414
These are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana

00:05:33.414 --> 00:05:35.827
and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.

00:05:35.827 --> 00:05:38.432
The legacy they left is that they
brought independence to Africa.

00:05:38.432 --> 00:05:39.737
They freed us from colonialism,

00:05:39.737 --> 00:05:42.121
and let's give them credit for that.

00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:45.133
They were followed by generation two.

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:47.183
These are people that brought nothing

00:05:47.183 --> 00:05:49.320
but havoc to Africa.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.750
Think warfare, corruption, human rights abuses.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.783
This is the stereotype of 
the typical African leader

00:05:54.783 --> 00:05:56.178
that we typically think of:

00:05:56.178 --> 00:05:58.184
Mobutu Sese Seko from Zaire,

00:05:58.184 --> 00:06:00.565
Sani Abacha from Nigeria.

00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:03.741
The good news is that most of
these leaders have moved on,

00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:05.845
and they were replaced by generation three.

00:06:05.845 --> 00:06:08.161
These are people like the late Nelson Mandela

00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:10.175
and most of the leaders that we see in Africa today,

00:06:10.175 --> 00:06:12.852
like Paul Kagame and so forth.

00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:15.960
Now these leaders are by no means perfect,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.605
but the one thing they have done is that they have

00:06:17.605 --> 00:06:20.603
cleaned up much of the mess of generation two.

00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:22.061
They've stopped the fighting,

00:06:22.061 --> 00:06:25.160
and I call them the stabilizer generation.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.110
They're much more accountable to their people,

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.305
they've improved macroeconomic policies,

00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:32.240
and we are seeing for the first time

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.580
Africa's growing, and in 
fact it's the second fastest

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.425
growing economic region in the world.

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:38.591
So these leaders are by no means perfect,

00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:39.923
but they are by and large

00:06:39.923 --> 00:06:44.749
the best leaders we've seen in the last 50 years.

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:47.628
So where to from here?

00:06:47.628 --> 00:06:49.844
I believe that the next generation

00:06:49.844 --> 00:06:52.476
to come after this, generation four,

00:06:52.476 --> 00:06:55.009
has a unique opportunity

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:57.564
to transform the continent.

00:06:57.564 --> 00:06:59.408
Specifically, they can do two things

00:06:59.408 --> 00:07:01.534
that previous generations have not done.

00:07:01.534 --> 00:07:03.716
The first thing they need to do

00:07:03.716 --> 00:07:06.144
is they need to create prosperity for the continent.

00:07:06.144 --> 00:07:08.031
Why is prosperity so important?

00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:09.714
Because none of the previous generations

00:07:09.714 --> 00:07:12.394
have been able to tackle this issue of poverty.

00:07:12.394 --> 00:07:13.710
Africa today

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.540
has the fastest growing population in the world,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.241
but also is the poorest.

00:07:19.241 --> 00:07:22.918
By 2030, Africa will have a
larger workforce than China,

00:07:22.918 --> 00:07:26.720
and by 2050, it will have the
largest workforce in the world.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.252
One billion people will need jobs in Africa,

00:07:29.252 --> 00:07:31.626
so if we don't grow our economies fast enough,

00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:34.073
we're sitting on a ticking time bomb,

00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:37.605
not just for Africa but for the entire world.

00:07:37.605 --> 00:07:39.743
Let me show you an example

00:07:39.743 --> 00:07:41.449
of one person who is living up to this legacy

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:44.212
of creating prosperity: Laetitia.

00:07:44.212 --> 00:07:47.203
Laetitia's a young woman from Kenya

00:07:47.203 --> 00:07:49.000
who at the age of 13 had to drop out of school

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.910
because her family couldn't 
afford to pay fees for her.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.111
So she started her own business rearing rabbits,

00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:55.710
which happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.308
that she's from.

00:07:57.308 --> 00:07:59.292
This business did so well that within a year,

00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:01.448
she was employing 15 women

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.425
and was able to generate enough income

00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:05.146
that she was able to send herself to school,

00:08:05.146 --> 00:08:06.155
and through these women

00:08:06.155 --> 00:08:08.862
fund another 65 children to go to school.

00:08:08.862 --> 00:08:10.564
The profits that she generated,

00:08:10.564 --> 00:08:12.149
she used that to build a school,

00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:13.697
and today she educates

00:08:13.697 --> 00:08:16.238
400 children in her community.

00:08:16.238 --> 00:08:18.128
And she's just turned 18.

00:08:18.128 --> 00:08:22.443
(Applause)

00:08:24.857 --> 00:08:28.713
Another example is Erick Rajaonary.

00:08:28.713 --> 00:08:31.797
Erick comes from the island of Madagascar.

00:08:31.797 --> 00:08:34.596
Now, Erick realized that agriculture

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:36.260
would be the key to creating jobs

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.319
in the rural areas of Madagascar,

00:08:38.319 --> 00:08:40.265
but he also realized that fertilizer was a very

00:08:40.265 --> 00:08:43.596
expensive input for most farmers in Madagascar.

00:08:43.596 --> 00:08:46.623
Madagascar has these very special bats

00:08:46.623 --> 00:08:48.207
that produce these droppings

00:08:48.207 --> 00:08:50.614
that are very high in nutrients.

00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:53.989
In 2006, Erick quit his job 
as a chartered accountant

00:08:53.989 --> 00:08:55.958
and started a company to manufacture

00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.144
fertilizer from the bat droppings.

00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:01.442
Today, Erick has built a business

00:09:01.442 --> 00:09:04.283
that generates several million dollars of revenue,

00:09:04.283 --> 00:09:07.116
and he employs 70 people full time

00:09:07.116 --> 00:09:08.994
and another 800 people during the season

00:09:08.994 --> 00:09:11.976
when the bats drop their droppings the most.

00:09:11.976 --> 00:09:14.539
Now, what I like about this story

00:09:14.539 --> 00:09:18.421
is that it shows that opportunities 
to create prosperity

00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:20.716
can be found almost anywhere.

00:09:20.716 --> 00:09:22.770
Erick is known as the Batman.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.785
(Laughter)

00:09:23.785 --> 00:09:25.752
And who would have thought that you would have

00:09:25.752 --> 00:09:28.414
been able to build a multimillion-dollar business

00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:32.766
employing so many people just from bat poo?

00:09:35.444 --> 00:09:39.395
The second thing that this generation needs to do

00:09:39.395 --> 00:09:41.836
is to create our institutions.

00:09:41.836 --> 00:09:43.651
They need to build these institutions such that we

00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:46.876
are never held to ransom again

00:09:46.876 --> 00:09:51.330
by a few individuals like Robert Mugabe.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.472
Now, all of this sounds great,

00:09:54.472 --> 00:09:58.500
but where are we going to
get this generation four from?

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.941
Do we just sit and hope that they emerge

00:10:00.941 --> 00:10:04.705
by chance, or that God gives them to us?

00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:06.458
No, I don't think so.

00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:09.610
It's too important an issue 
for us to leave it to chance.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.917
I believe that we need to create African institutions,

00:10:12.917 --> 00:10:15.628
home-grown, that will identify and develop

00:10:15.628 --> 00:10:19.379
these leaders in a systematic, practical way.

00:10:19.379 --> 00:10:21.030
We've been doing this for the last 10 years

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.581
through the African Leadership Academy.

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:26.262
Laetitia is one of our young leaders.

00:10:26.262 --> 00:10:28.670
Today, we have 700 of them 
that are being groomed

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.720
for the African continent,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.795
and over the next 50 years,

00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:34.789
we expect to create 6,000 of them.

00:10:34.789 --> 00:10:37.408
But one thing has been troubling me.

00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:39.500
We would get about 4,000 applications a year

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.569
for 100 young leaders that we could take

00:10:41.569 --> 00:10:42.883
into this academy,

00:10:42.883 --> 00:10:44.944
and so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:47.835
for this leadership training that we're offering.

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:50.951
But we couldn't satisfy it.

00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:54.973
So today, I'm announcing for the first time in public

00:10:54.973 --> 00:10:59.611
an extension to this vision for
the African Leadership Academy.

00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:04.718
We're building 25 brand new universities in Africa

00:11:04.718 --> 00:11:06.267
that are going to cultivate this next generation

00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:08.113
of African leaders.

00:11:08.113 --> 00:11:11.975
Each campus will have 10,000 leaders at a time

00:11:11.975 --> 00:11:14.201
so we'll be educating and developing

00:11:14.201 --> 00:11:17.015
250,000 leaders at any given time.

00:11:17.015 --> 00:11:20.738
(Applause)

00:11:24.137 --> 00:11:26.388
Over the next 50 years, this institution

00:11:26.388 --> 00:11:28.346
will create three million transformative leaders

00:11:28.346 --> 00:11:30.379
for the continent.

00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:32.620
My hope is that half of them

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.172
will become the entrepreneurs that we need,

00:11:34.172 --> 00:11:35.995
who will create these jobs that we need,

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:37.502
and the other half

00:11:37.502 --> 00:11:39.189
will go into government

00:11:39.189 --> 00:11:40.388
and the nonprofit sector,

00:11:40.388 --> 00:11:44.010
and they will build the institutions that we need.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.400
But they won't just learn academics.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.190
They will also learn how to become leaders,

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.074
and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs.

00:11:52.074 --> 00:11:55.938
So think of this as Africa's Ivy League,

00:11:55.938 --> 00:11:59.220
but instead of getting admitted
because of your SAT scores

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.101
or because of how much money you have

00:12:01.101 --> 00:12:02.303
or which family you come from,

00:12:02.303 --> 00:12:05.225
the main criteria for getting into this university

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.199
will be what is the potential that you have

00:12:07.199 --> 00:12:10.461
for transforming Africa?

00:12:10.461 --> 00:12:13.970
But what we're doing is 
just one group of institutions.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:18.060
We cannot transform Africa by ourselves.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.762
My hope

00:12:19.762 --> 00:12:21.900
is that many, many other home-grown

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.318
African institutions will blossom,

00:12:25.318 --> 00:12:27.020
and these institutions will all come together

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.480
with a common vision of developing

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.363
this next generation of African leaders,

00:12:31.363 --> 00:12:33.296
generation four,

00:12:33.296 --> 00:12:35.760
and they will teach them this common message:

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.540
create jobs, build our institutions.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.790
Nelson Mandela once said,

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.592
"Every now and then,

00:12:44.592 --> 00:12:47.828
a generation is called upon to be great.

00:12:47.828 --> 00:12:51.036
You can be that great generation."

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:54.588
I believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate

00:12:54.588 --> 00:12:57.561
the next generation of African leaders,

00:12:57.561 --> 00:13:00.336
then this generation four that is coming up

00:13:00.336 --> 00:13:03.768
will be the greatest generation that Africa

00:13:03.768 --> 00:13:08.180
and indeed the entire world has ever seen.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.212
Thank you.

00:13:10.212 --> 00:13:13.797
(Applause)
