WEBVTT

00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:08.237
George and Charlotte Blonsky, who were

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:11.609
a married couple living in
the Bronx in New York City,

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:12.854
invented something.

00:00:12.854 --> 00:00:16.833
They got a patent in
1965 for what they call,

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:22.508
"a device to assist women in giving birth."

00:00:22.508 --> 00:00:26.438
This device consists of a large, round table


00:00:26.438 --> 00:00:28.191
and some machinery.

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:31.400
When the woman is ready to deliver her child,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.801
she lies on her back,

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:35.232
she is strapped down to the table,

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:38.311
and the table is rotated at high speed.

00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:41.736
The child comes flying out

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:48.767
through centrifugal force.

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:54.246
If you look at their patent carefully,

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:58.115
especially if you have any
engineering background or talent,

00:00:58.115 --> 00:00:59.574
you may decide that you see

00:00:59.574 --> 00:01:06.261
one or two points where the design is 
not perfectly adequate. (Laughter)

00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:09.030
Doctor Ivan Schwab in California

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.984
is one of the people, 
one of the main people,

00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:12.570
who helped answer the question,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.281
"Why don't woodpeckers get headaches?"

00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:19.498
And it turns out the answer to that

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:21.722
is because their brains

00:01:21.722 --> 00:01:23.493
are packaged inside their skulls

00:01:23.493 --> 00:01:25.993
in a way different from the way

00:01:25.993 --> 00:01:28.497
our brains, we being human beings,

00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:32.456
true, have our brains packaged.

00:01:32.456 --> 00:01:34.839
They, the woodpeckers, typically

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:37.027
will peck, they will bang their head

00:01:37.027 --> 00:01:42.318
on a piece of wood thousands 
of times every day. Every day!

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:44.231
And as far as anyone knows,

00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:45.437
that doesn't bother them in the slightest.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.703
How does this happen?

00:01:47.703 --> 00:01:50.629
Their brain does not slosh around like ours does.

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:53.341
Their brain is packed in very tightly,

00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.197
at least for blows coming 
right from the front.

00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:58.140
Not too many people paid attention

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.224
to this research until
the last few years

00:02:01.224 --> 00:02:03.839
when, in this country especially,

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:05.227
people are becoming curious about

00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:07.422
what happens to the brains
of football players

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:10.150
who bang their heads repeatedly.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.218
And the woodpecker maybe relates to that.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.311
There was a paper published

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:19.056
in the medical journal The Lancet

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:20.486
in England a few years ago called

00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:27.903
" A man who pricked his finger
and smelled putrid for 5 years."

00:02:27.903 --> 00:02:29.711
Dr. Caroline Mills and her team

00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:33.810
received this patient and didn't 
really know what to do about it.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.670
The man had cut his finger,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.143
he worked processing chickens,

00:02:39.143 --> 00:02:41.579
and then he started to
smell really, really bad.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:42.798
So bad that when 
he got in a room

00:02:42.798 --> 00:02:44.115
with the doctors and the nurses,

00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:46.874
they couldn't stand being 
in the room with him.

00:02:46.874 --> 00:02:48.675
It was intolerable.

00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:50.174
They tried every drug,

00:02:50.174 --> 00:02:51.992
every other treatment
they could think of.

00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:54.223
After a year, he still 
smelled putrid.

00:02:54.223 --> 00:02:56.032
After two years, still smelled putrid.

00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:59.262
Three years, four years,
still smelled putrid.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.299
After five years, it went away on its own.

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.998
It's a mystery.

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:08.347
In New Zealand, Dr. Lianne Parkin

00:03:08.347 --> 00:03:13.909
and her team tested an old 
tradition in her city.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.636
They live in a city that has huge hills,

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:18.255
San Francisco-grade hills.

00:03:18.255 --> 00:03:20.372
And in the winter there,
it gets very cold

00:03:20.372 --> 00:03:21.556
and very icy.

00:03:21.556 --> 00:03:23.150
There are lots of injuries.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.415
The tradition that they tested,

00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:27.047
they tested by asking people

00:03:27.047 --> 00:03:29.446
who were on their way to 
work in the morning,

00:03:29.446 --> 00:03:31.389
to stop and try something out.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.392
Try one of two conditions.

00:03:33.392 --> 00:03:36.145
The tradition is that in the winter,

00:03:36.145 --> 00:03:40.861
in that city, you wear your socks
on the outside of your boots.

00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:44.260
And what they discovered by experiment,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.429
and it was quite graphic when they saw it,

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:47.844
was that it's true.

00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:51.163
That if you wear your socks on the 
outside rather than the inside,

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:56.516
you're much more likely 
to survive and not slip and fall.

00:03:56.516 --> 00:04:01.894
Now, I hope you will agree
with me that these things

00:04:01.894 --> 00:04:04.109
I've just described to you,

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:10.289
each of them, deserves some kind of prize.
(Laughter)

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:11.924
And that's what they got,

00:04:11.924 --> 00:04:15.199
each of them got an Ig Nobel prize.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.191
In 1991, I, together with bunch of other people,

00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:22.094
started the Ig Nobel prize ceremony.

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:25.026
Every year we give out 10 prizes.

00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:32.009
The prizes are based on just 
one criteria. It's very simple.

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.993
It's that you've done something that 
makes people laugh and then think.

00:04:37.993 --> 00:04:41.837
What you've done makes 
people laugh and then think.

00:04:41.837 --> 00:04:43.845

Whatever it is, there's something about it

00:04:43.845 --> 00:04:46.582

that when people encounter it at first,

00:04:46.582 --> 00:04:49.893
their only possible reaction is to laugh.

00:04:49.893 --> 00:04:51.816
And then a week later,

00:04:51.816 --> 00:04:53.507
it's still rattling around in their heads

00:04:53.507 --> 00:04:56.267
and all they want to do 
is tell their friends about it.

00:04:56.267 --> 00:04:58.465
That's the quality we look for.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.250
Every year, we get in the neighborhood

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.692
of 9,000 new nominations 
for the Ig Nobel prize.

00:05:05.692 --> 00:05:08.521
Of those, consistently between 10 percent

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:11.004
and 20 percent of those nominations

00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:14.914
are people who nominate themselves.

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:18.881
Those self-nominees almost never win.

00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:23.200
It's very difficult, numerically, 
to win a prize if you want to.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.045
Even if you don't want to,

00:05:25.045 --> 00:05:27.761
it's very difficult numerically.

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:31.411
You should know that when 
we choose somebody

00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:32.683
to win an Ig Nobel prize,

00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:36.259
We get in touch with that person, very quietly.

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.820
We offer them the chance to decline

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.202
this great honor if they want to.

00:05:42.202 --> 00:05:45.526
Happily for us, almost everyone 
who's offered a prize

00:05:45.526 --> 00:05:49.035
decides to accept.

00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:51.976
What do you get if you
win an Ig Nobel prize?

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.553
Well, you get several things.

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:57.083
You get an Ig Nobel prize.

00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:59.414
The design is different every year.

00:05:59.414 --> 00:06:04.220
These are always handmade
from extremely cheap materials.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.881
You're looking at a picture

00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:09.910
of the prize we gave last year, 2013.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.946
Most prizes in the world also give

00:06:11.946 --> 00:06:16.644
their winners some cash, some money.

00:06:16.644 --> 00:06:17.707
We don't have any money,

00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:19.218
so we can't give them.

00:06:19.218 --> 00:06:22.094
In fact, the winners have to
pay their own way

00:06:22.094 --> 00:06:24.898
to come to the Ig Nobel ceremony,

00:06:24.898 --> 00:06:26.761
which most of them do.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:29.754
Last year, though, we did manage
to scrape up some money.

00:06:29.754 --> 00:06:34.265
Last year, each of the 10
Ig Nobel prize winners

00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:40.043
received from us 10 trillion dollars.

00:06:40.043 --> 00:06:45.476
A $10 trillion bill from Zimbabwe. (Laughter)

00:06:45.476 --> 00:06:48.300
You may remember that 
Zimbabwe had a little adventure

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.895
for a few years there of inflation.

00:06:50.895 --> 00:06:52.515
They ended up printing bills

00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:56.371
that were in denominations as
large as 100 trillion dollars.

00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:59.156
The man responsible, who runs
the national bank there, by the way,

00:06:59.156 --> 00:07:01.929
won an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics.

00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:03.681
The other thing you win is an invitation

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.184
to come to the ceremony,

00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:06.926
which happens at Harvard University.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.061
And when you get there,

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:10.778
you come to Harvard's biggest 
meeting place and classroom.

00:07:10.778 --> 00:07:12.063
It fits 1,100 people,

00:07:12.063 --> 00:07:13.189
it's jammed to the gills,

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:14.020
and up on the stage,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.814
waiting to shake your hand,

00:07:15.814 --> 00:07:18.086
waiting to hand you your Ig Nobel prize,

00:07:18.086 --> 00:07:20.735
are a bunch of Nobel prize winners.

00:07:20.735 --> 00:07:22.034
That's the heart of the ceremony.

00:07:22.034 --> 00:07:24.184
The winners are kept secret until that moment,

00:07:24.184 --> 00:07:26.611
even the Nobel laureates 
who will shake their hand

00:07:26.611 --> 00:07:29.854
don't know who they are
until they're announced.

00:07:29.854 --> 00:07:32.974
I am going to tell you 
about just a very few

00:07:32.974 --> 00:07:36.028
of the other medical-related prizes we've given.

00:07:36.028 --> 00:07:38.284
Keep in mind, we've given 230 prizes. 


00:07:38.284 --> 00:07:40.578
There are lots of these people
who walk among you.

00:07:40.578 --> 00:07:42.698
Maybe you have one.

00:07:42.698 --> 00:07:44.842
A paper was published about 30 years ago

00:07:44.842 --> 00:07:47.352
called "Injuries due to Falling Coconuts."

00:07:47.352 --> 00:07:49.307
It was written by Dr. Peter Barss,

00:07:49.307 --> 00:07:51.518
who is Canadian.

00:07:51.518 --> 00:07:53.704
Dr. Barss came to the ceremony

00:07:53.704 --> 00:07:55.571
and explained that as a young doctor,

00:07:55.571 --> 00:07:57.052
he wanted to see the world.

00:07:57.052 --> 00:07:59.341
So he went to Papua New Guinea.

00:07:59.341 --> 00:08:01.680
When he got there, he went to work
in a hospital, and he was curious

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.195
what kinds of things happen to people
that bring them to the hospital.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.493
He looked through the 
records, and he discovered

00:08:08.493 --> 00:08:11.283
that a surprisingly large number of people

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:12.449
in that hospital were there

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:15.996
because of injuries due to falling coconuts.

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.782
One typical thing that happens is

00:08:17.782 --> 00:08:21.581
people will come from the highlands,
where there are not many coconut trees,

00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:23.829
down to visit their relatives on the coast,

00:08:23.829 --> 00:08:25.289
where there are lots.

00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:26.679
And they'll think that a coconut tree

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:29.348
is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down.

00:08:29.348 --> 00:08:31.955
A coconut tree that is 90 feet tall,

00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:34.178
and has coconuts that weigh two pounds

00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:38.230
that can drop off at any time.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.023
A team of doctors in Europe

00:08:40.023 --> 00:08:43.532
published a series of papers
about colonoscopies.

00:08:43.532 --> 00:08:45.562
You're all familiar with colonoscopies,

00:08:45.562 --> 00:08:46.854
one way or another.

00:08:46.854 --> 00:08:48.169
Or in some cases,

00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:51.674
one way and another.

00:08:51.674 --> 00:08:55.023
They, in these papers,

00:08:55.023 --> 00:08:59.191
explained to their fellow doctors
who perform colonoscopies,

00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.162
how to minimize the chance

00:09:01.162 --> 00:09:03.823
that when you perform a colonoscopy,

00:09:03.823 --> 00:09:07.413
your patient will explode. (Laughter)

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:09.373
Dr. Emmanuel Ben-Soussan

00:09:09.373 --> 00:09:10.547
one of the authors,

00:09:10.547 --> 00:09:13.706
flew in from Paris to the ceremony,

00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:15.597
where he explained the history of this,

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:16.773
that in the 1950s,

00:09:16.773 --> 00:09:22.101
when colonoscopies were becoming
a common technique for the first time,

00:09:22.101 --> 00:09:24.740
people were figuring out how to do it well.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.500
And there were some difficulties at first.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.471
The basic problem, I'm sure you're familiar with,

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:36.800
that you're looking inside a 
long, narrow, dark place.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.355
And so, you want to have a larger space.

00:09:40.355 --> 00:09:42.486
You add some gas to inflate it

00:09:42.486 --> 00:09:44.400
so you have room to look around.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.127
Now, that's added to the 
gas, the methane gas,

00:09:47.127 --> 00:09:48.635
that's already inside.

00:09:48.635 --> 00:09:51.635
The gas that they used at first,
in many cases, was oxygen.

00:09:51.635 --> 00:09:54.084
So they added oxygen to methane gas.

00:09:54.084 --> 00:09:55.799
And then they wanted to be able to see,

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:57.047
they needed light,

00:09:57.047 --> 00:09:58.452
so they'd put in a light source,

00:09:58.452 --> 00:10:00.228
which in the 1950s was very hot.

00:10:00.228 --> 00:10:03.546
So you had methane gas, which is flammable,

00:10:03.546 --> 00:10:06.338
oxygen and heat.

00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:11.476
They stopped using oxygen pretty quickly.
(Laughter)

00:10:11.476 --> 00:10:13.997
Now it's rare that patients will explode,

00:10:13.997 --> 00:10:19.736
but it does still happen.

00:10:19.736 --> 00:10:23.311
The final thing that I want 
to tell you about is a prize

00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:25.742
we gave to Dr. Elena Bodnar.

00:10:25.742 --> 00:10:29.867
Dr. Elena Bodnar invented a brassiere

00:10:29.867 --> 00:10:31.425
that in an emergency

00:10:31.425 --> 00:10:32.618
can be quickly separated 


00:10:32.618 --> 00:10:36.137
into a pair of protective face masks.

00:10:36.137 --> 00:10:37.904
One to save your life,

00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:43.228
one to save the life of some 
lucky bystander. (Laughter)

00:10:43.228 --> 00:10:46.255
Why would someone do this, you might wonder.

00:10:46.255 --> 00:10:48.387
Dr. Bodnar came to the ceremony

00:10:48.387 --> 00:10:51.348
and she explained that 
she grew up in Ukraine.

00:10:51.348 --> 00:10:53.064
She was one of the doctors who treated victims

00:10:53.064 --> 00:10:55.108
of the Chernobyl power plant meltdown.

00:10:55.108 --> 00:10:57.692
And they later discovered that

00:10:57.692 --> 00:10:59.617
a lot of the worst medical problems

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.739
came from the particles people breathed in.

00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:03.667
So she was always thinking after that

00:11:03.667 --> 00:11:05.294
about could there be some simple mask


00:11:05.294 --> 00:11:09.990
that was available everywhere
when the unexpected happens.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.603
Years later, she moved to America.

00:11:11.603 --> 00:11:12.447
She had a baby,

00:11:12.447 --> 00:11:14.203
One day she looked, and on the floor,

00:11:14.203 --> 00:11:17.274
her infant son had picked up her bra,

00:11:17.274 --> 00:11:19.133
and had her bra on his face.

00:11:19.133 --> 00:11:20.814
And that's where the idea came from.

00:11:20.814 --> 00:11:22.817
She came to the Ig Nobel ceremony

00:11:22.817 --> 00:11:25.157
with the first prototype of the bra

00:11:25.157 --> 00:11:29.511
and she demonstrated:

00:11:29.511 --> 00:11:53.275
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:11:58.265 --> 00:12:06.694

laureate (2001) in physics"]

00:12:43.663 --> 00:12:47.283
I myself own an emergency bra. (Laughter)

00:12:47.283 --> 00:12:49.621
It's my favorite bra,

00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:52.273
but I would be happy to 
share it with any of you,

00:12:52.273 --> 00:12:54.122
should the need arise.

00:12:54.122 --> 00:12:55.078
Thank you.

00:12:55.078 --> 00:13:00.075
(Applause)
