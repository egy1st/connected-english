WEBVTT

00:00:01.721 --> 00:00:04.181
I have a confession to make.

00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:07.420
I am addicted to adventure,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.859
and as a young boy,

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.367
I would rather look outside the window

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:15.101
at the birds in the trees and the sky

00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:17.237
than looking at that two-dimensional

00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:21.208
chalky blackboard where time stands still

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:23.953
and even sometimes dies.

00:00:23.953 --> 00:00:25.763
My teachers thought there was something wrong

00:00:25.763 --> 00:00:29.150
with me because I wasn't paying attention in class.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.170
They didn't find anything 
specifically wrong with me,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.692
other than being slightly 
dyslexic because I'm a lefty.

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:39.807
But they didn't test for curiosity.

00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:42.388
Curiosity, to me,

00:00:42.388 --> 00:00:44.361
is about our connection

00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.606
with the world, with the universe.

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:49.496
It's about seeing what's 
around that next coral head

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:51.195
or what's around that next tree,

00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:53.254
and learning more not only about our environment

00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:55.324
but about ourselves.

00:00:55.324 --> 00:00:57.854
Now, my dream of dreams,

00:00:57.854 --> 00:01:01.128
I want to go explore the oceans of Mars,

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:03.974
but until we can go there,

00:01:03.974 --> 00:01:07.440
I think the oceans still hold

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.879
quite a few secrets.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:10.243
As a matter of fact,

00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:13.798
if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is

00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:17.429
and dissect it into a living space,

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.824
the ocean represents over 3.4 billion

00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:23.311
cubic kilometers of volume, within which

00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:27.821
we've explored less than five percent.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.080
And I look at this, and I go, well,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.446
there are tools to go 
deeper, longer and further:

00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:38.659
submarines, ROVs, even Scuba diving.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.267
But if we're going to explore the final frontier

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:44.754
on this planet, we need to live there.

00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:47.352
We need to build a log cabin, if you will,

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:50.412
at the bottom of the sea.

00:01:50.412 --> 00:01:53.378
And so there was a great curiosity in my soul

00:01:53.378 --> 00:01:56.145
when I went to go visit a TED [Prize winner]

00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:57.580
by the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.064
Maybe you've heard of her.

00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:02.840
Two years ago, she was staked out

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.684
at the last undersea marine laboratory

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:07.667
to try and save it,

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:09.355
to try and petition

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:11.145
for us not to scrap it

00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:13.546
and bring it back on land.

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:15.458
We've only had about a dozen or so

00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:17.888
scientific labs at the bottom of the sea.

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.800
There's only one left in the world:

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.021
it's nine miles offshore

00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.355
and 65 feet down.

00:02:23.355 --> 00:02:25.010
It's called Aquarius.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.382
Aquarius, in some fashion,

00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:29.631
is a dinosaur,

00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:31.971
an ancient robot chained to the bottom,

00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:35.391
this Leviathan.

00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:37.546
In other ways, it's a legacy.

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:40.430
And so with that visit, I realized 
that my time is short

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.681
if I wanted to experience

00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:47.708
what it was like to become an aquanaut.

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:50.194
When we swam towards this after many

00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:52.940
moons of torture and two years of preparation,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.909
this habitat waiting to invite us

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.925
was like a new home.

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:03.120
And the point of going down to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.967
and living at this habitat was not to stay inside.

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.566
It wasn't about living at something
the size of a school bus.

00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:12.772
It was about giving us the luxury of time

00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:15.821
outside to wander, to explore,

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:19.704
to understand more about this oceanic final frontier.

00:03:19.704 --> 00:03:22.011
We had megafauna come and visit us.

00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:25.551
This spotted eagle ray is a fairly
common sight in the oceans.

00:03:25.551 --> 00:03:28.183
But why this is so important,

00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:29.758
why this picture is up,

00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:33.223
is because this particular animal
brought his friends around,

00:03:33.223 --> 00:03:36.370
and instead of being the
pelagic animals that they were,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.760
they started getting curious about us,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.749
these new strangers that were
moving into the neighborhood,

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:44.268
doing things with plankton.

00:03:44.268 --> 00:03:46.970
We were studying all sorts of animals and critters,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.457
and they got closer and closer to us,

00:03:49.457 --> 00:03:51.239
and because of the luxury of time,

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.590
these animals, these residents of the coral reef,

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.004
were starting to get used to us,

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:58.681
and these pelagics that
normal travel through stopped.

00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:01.184
This particular animal actually circled

00:04:01.184 --> 00:04:05.335
for 31 full days during our mission.

00:04:05.335 --> 00:04:07.675
So mission 31 wasn't so much

00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:09.587
about breaking records.

00:04:09.587 --> 00:04:14.021
It was about that human-ocean connection.

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.175
Because of the luxury of time, we were able

00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:20.134
to study animals such as sharks and grouper

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:22.384
in aggregations that we've never seen before.

00:04:22.384 --> 00:04:26.970
It's like seeing dogs and 
cats behaving well together.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.745
Even being able to commune with animals

00:04:28.745 --> 00:04:29.872
that are much larger than us,

00:04:29.872 --> 00:04:32.634
such as this endangered goliath grouper

00:04:32.634 --> 00:04:35.896
who only still resides in the Florida Keys.

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:38.205
Of course, just like any neighbor,

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:40.725
after a while, if they get tired,

00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:42.345
the goliath grouper barks at us,

00:04:42.345 --> 00:04:44.141
and this bark is so powerful

00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:46.800
that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.769
within a split second.

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:50.286
For us, it's just telling us to go back

00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:54.918
into the habitat and leave them alone.

00:04:54.918 --> 00:04:58.149
Now, this wasn't just about adventure.

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:59.978
There was actually a serious note to it.

00:04:59.978 --> 00:05:03.279
We did a lot of science, and again,
because of the luxury of time,

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.845
we were able to do over three years of science

00:05:05.845 --> 00:05:08.306
in 31 days.

00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:10.522
In this particular case, we were using a PAM,

00:05:10.522 --> 00:05:12.243
or, let me just see if I can get this straight,

00:05:12.243 --> 00:05:16.262
a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer.

00:05:16.262 --> 00:05:19.465
And our scientists from FIU, MIT,

00:05:19.465 --> 00:05:21.520
and from Northeastern

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.493
were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do

00:05:24.493 --> 00:05:26.181
when we're not around.

00:05:26.181 --> 00:05:28.734
The Pulse Amplitude Modulated
Fluorometer, or PAM,

00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:31.240
gauges the fluorescence of corals

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.717
as it pertains to pollutants in the water

00:05:33.717 --> 00:05:37.103
as well as climate change-related issues.

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:40.601
We used all sorts of other cutting-edge tools,

00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:42.930
such as this sonde, or what I like to call

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.084
the sponge proctologist, whereby the sonde

00:05:49.084 --> 00:05:51.887
itself tests for metabolism rates

00:05:51.887 --> 00:05:54.987
in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge,

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:57.338
or the redwoods of the [ocean].

00:05:57.338 --> 00:05:58.610
And this gives us a much better gauge

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.928
of what's happening underwater

00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:03.863
with regard to climate change-related issues,

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.651
and how the dynamics of that

00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:08.261
affect us here on land.

00:06:08.261 --> 00:06:10.743
And finally, we looked at predator-prey behavior.

00:06:10.743 --> 00:06:12.671
And predator-prey behavior is an interesting thing,

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:15.168
because as we take away some of the predators

00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:17.339
on these coral reefs around the world,

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:20.904
the prey, or the forage fish, act very differently.

00:06:20.904 --> 00:06:22.558
What we realized is

00:06:22.558 --> 00:06:25.741
not only do they stop taking care of the reef,

00:06:25.741 --> 00:06:27.665
darting in, grabbing a little bit of algae

00:06:27.665 --> 00:06:29.184
and going back into their homes,

00:06:29.184 --> 00:06:31.163
they start spreading out and disappearing

00:06:31.163 --> 00:06:33.278
from those particular coral reefs.

00:06:33.278 --> 00:06:35.606
Well, within that 31 days,

00:06:35.606 --> 00:06:38.295
we were able to generate over 10 scientific papers

00:06:38.295 --> 00:06:41.426
on each one of these topics.

00:06:41.426 --> 00:06:46.132
But the point of adventure is not only to learn,

00:06:46.132 --> 00:06:48.525
it's to be able to share that 
knowledge with the world,

00:06:48.525 --> 00:06:52.507
and with that, thanks to a 
couple of engineers at MIT,

00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:55.840
we were able to use a prototype
camera called the Edgertronic

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.901
to capture slow-motion video,

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:01.673
up to 20,000 frames per second

00:07:01.673 --> 00:07:03.052
in a little box

00:07:03.052 --> 00:07:04.693
that's worth 3,000 dollars.

00:07:04.693 --> 00:07:06.937
It's available to every one of us.

00:07:06.937 --> 00:07:09.655
And that particular camera gives us an insight

00:07:09.655 --> 00:07:12.280
into what fairly common animals do

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.526
but we can't even see it in the blink of an eye.

00:07:14.526 --> 00:07:16.836
Let me show you a quick video

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:18.906
of what this camera does.

00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:21.741
You can see the silky bubble come out

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.920
of our hard hats.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.252
It gives us an insight

00:07:26.252 --> 00:07:28.613
into some of the animals that we were sitting

00:07:28.613 --> 00:07:30.571
right next to for 31 days

00:07:30.571 --> 00:07:33.280
and never normally would have paid attention to,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.160
such as hermit crabs.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.175
Now, using a cutting-edge piece of technology

00:07:38.175 --> 00:07:40.300
that's not really meant for the oceans

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.444
is not always easy.

00:07:42.444 --> 00:07:44.992
We sometimes had to put the camera upside down,

00:07:44.992 --> 00:07:47.552
cordon it back to the lab,

00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:50.073
and actually man the trigger

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.247
from the lab itself.

00:07:52.247 --> 00:07:54.441
But what this gives us

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:57.275
is the foresight to look at and analyze

00:07:57.275 --> 00:08:00.482
in scientific and engineering terms

00:08:00.482 --> 00:08:03.646
some of the most amazing behavior

00:08:03.646 --> 00:08:04.901
that the human eye just can't pick up,

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:07.950
such as this manta shrimp

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.718
trying to catch its prey,

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:15.217
within about .3 seconds.

00:08:15.217 --> 00:08:18.312
That punch is as strong as a .22 caliber bullet,

00:08:18.312 --> 00:08:19.657
and if you ever try to catch a bullet

00:08:19.657 --> 00:08:23.675
in mid-flight with your eye, impossible.

00:08:23.675 --> 00:08:24.978
But now we can see things

00:08:24.978 --> 00:08:27.648
such as these Christmas tree worms

00:08:27.648 --> 00:08:30.809
pulling in and fanning out

00:08:30.809 --> 00:08:33.845
in a way that the eye just can't capture,

00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:35.219
or in this case,

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:42.280
a fish throwing up grains of sand.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.670
This is an actual sailfin goby,

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.186
and if you look at it in real time,

00:08:47.186 --> 00:08:50.191
it actually doesn't even show its fanning motion

00:08:50.191 --> 00:08:53.362
because it's so quick.

00:08:53.362 --> 00:08:55.634
One of the most precious gifts
that we had underwater

00:08:55.634 --> 00:08:57.974
is that we had WiFi,

00:08:57.974 --> 00:09:00.190
and for 31 days straight we were able to connect

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.903
with the world in real time 
from the bottom of the sea

00:09:02.903 --> 00:09:04.735
and share all of these experiences.

00:09:04.735 --> 00:09:06.160
Quite literally right there

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.306
I am Skyping in the classroom

00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:09.324
with one of the six continents

00:09:09.324 --> 00:09:12.280
and some of the 70,000 
students that we connected

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.070
every single day to some of these experiences.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.333
As a matter of fact, I'm showing a picture that I took

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:19.977
with my smartphone from underwater

00:09:19.977 --> 00:09:22.508
of a goliath grouper laying on the bottom.

00:09:22.508 --> 00:09:27.532
We had never seen that before.

00:09:27.532 --> 00:09:29.349
And I dream of the day

00:09:29.349 --> 00:09:31.844
that we have underwater cities,

00:09:31.844 --> 00:09:34.409
and maybe, just maybe, if we push the boundaries

00:09:34.409 --> 00:09:36.343
of adventure and knowledge,

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:39.584
and we share that knowledge with others out there,

00:09:39.584 --> 00:09:42.731
we can solve all sorts of problems.

00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:44.189
My grandfather used to say,

00:09:44.189 --> 00:09:47.142
"People protect what they love."

00:09:47.142 --> 00:09:49.741
My father, "How can people protect

00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:54.665
what they don't understand?"

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:58.706
And I've thought about this my whole life.

00:09:58.706 --> 00:10:02.014
Nothing is impossible.

00:10:02.014 --> 00:10:05.197
We need to dream, we need to be creative,

00:10:05.197 --> 00:10:07.570
and we all need to have an adventure

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.221
in order to create miracles in the darkest of times.

00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:13.858
And whether it's about climate change

00:10:13.858 --> 00:10:16.355
or eradicating poverty

00:10:16.355 --> 00:10:17.998
or giving back to future generations

00:10:17.998 --> 00:10:20.596
what we've taken for granted,

00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:22.610
it's about adventure.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.298
And who knows, maybe
there will be underwater cities,

00:10:25.298 --> 00:10:26.380
and maybe some of you

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.988
will become the future aquanauts.

00:10:28.988 --> 00:10:30.866
Thank you very much.

00:10:30.866 --> 00:10:34.717
(Applause)
