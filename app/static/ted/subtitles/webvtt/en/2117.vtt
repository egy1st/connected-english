00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:03.650
Humanity takes center stage at TED,

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.313
but I would like to add 
a voice for the animals,

00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:13.112
whose bodies and minds 
and spirits shaped us.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:16.358
Some years ago, it was my good fortune

00:00:16.358 --> 00:00:18.306
to meet a tribal elder on an island

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:20.860
not far from Vancouver.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.238
His name is Jimmy Smith,

00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:25.487
and he shared a story with me

00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:27.840
that is told among his people,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.035
who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw.

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:33.730
Once upon a time, he told me,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.587
all animals on Earth were one.

00:00:36.587 --> 00:00:39.511
Even though they look different on the outside,

00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:42.751
inside, they're all the same,

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.406
and from time to time they would gather

00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:48.156
at a sacred cave deep inside the forest

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:50.648
to celebrate their unity.

00:00:50.648 --> 00:00:52.392
When they arrived,

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:54.920
they would all take off their skins.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.444
Raven shed his feathers, bear his fur,

00:00:58.444 --> 00:01:00.907
and salmon her scales,

00:01:00.907 --> 00:01:03.829
and then, they would dance.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.130
But one day, a human made it to the cave

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.714
and laughed at what he saw

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:11.838
because he did not understand.

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.707
Embarrassed, the animals fled,

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.934
and that was the last time

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:20.556
they revealed themselves this way.

00:01:20.556 --> 00:01:23.240
The ancient understanding that underneath

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.143
their separate identities, all animals are one,

00:01:26.143 --> 00:01:29.881
has been a powerful inspiration to me.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.944
I like to get past the fur, the feathers

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:34.573
and the scales.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:36.801
I want to get under the skin.

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:39.601
No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant

00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:41.749
or a tiny tree frog,

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:48.641
my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.780
You may wonder, do I ever photograph people?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.615
Sure. People are always present in my photos,

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.742
no matter whether they appear

00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:00.561
to portray tortoises

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:02.374
or cougars

00:02:02.374 --> 00:02:04.253
or lions.

00:02:04.253 --> 00:02:08.751
You just have to learn how 
to look past their disguise.

00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:10.485
As a photographer,

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:13.300
I try to reach beyond the differences

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.264
in our genetic makeup

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:18.861
to appreciate all we have in common

00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:22.239
with every other living thing.

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.568
When I use my camera,

00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:26.491
I drop my skin

00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.191
like the animals at that cave

00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:33.128
so I can show who they really are.

00:02:33.128 --> 00:02:35.378
As animals blessed

00:02:35.378 --> 00:02:38.752
with the power of rational thought,

00:02:38.752 --> 00:02:43.285
we can marvel at the intricacies of life.

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:46.121
As citizens of a planet in trouble,

00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:48.685
it is our moral responsibility

00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:54.240
to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.107
But as humans with hearts,

00:02:56.107 --> 00:03:00.040
we can all rejoice in the unity of life,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.880
and perhaps we can change

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.760
what once happened in that sacred cave.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.992
Let's find a way to join the dance.

00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:14.775
Thank you.

00:03:14.775 --> 00:03:17.439
(Applause)
