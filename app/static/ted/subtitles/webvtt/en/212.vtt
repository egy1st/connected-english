00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to talk about two stories today.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
One is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demand

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
in the transportation sector.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
if we choose the right wireless technologies;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
how we can generate a new engine for economic growth

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm really scared.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We need to reduce C02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percent

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in order to avert catastrophic effects.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What are catastrophic effects? A three degree centigrade climate change rise

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that will result in 50 percent species extinction.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's not a movie. This is real life.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And I'm really worried, because when people talk about cars

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
-- which I know something about --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
"Let's use fuel-efficient cars."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If we started today, 10 years from now, at the end of this window of opportunity,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That is not enough.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But now I'll talk about some more pleasant things.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So, Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but it's an example of something called car sharing.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
for members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
How does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It means that I pay only for what I need.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
All those hours when a car is sitting idle, I'm not paying for it.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So, here's a woman that reserved MiniMia, and she had her day.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I can drive my Toyota Element when I'm going to go on that surfing trip.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And the other remarkable thing is it's, I think, the highest status of car ownership.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that I can have at my beck and call,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
but heaven forbid I would ever maintain

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn't have.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I get all the good stuff and none of the bad.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So, what is the social result of this?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The social result is that today's Zipcar has 100,000 members

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
driving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Instead of driving 12,000 miles a year, which is what the average city dweller does,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
they drive 500 miles a year. Are they happy?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it, or greater.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
People adore the company. And it's better,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
you know? They like it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So, how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It's because they said, "It's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
If I'm going to go buy some ice cream,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
do I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream? Or maybe I'll do without.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So, people really respond very quickly to it, to prices.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
to reserve a car, go get it, drive it.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And for me, as a service provider,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I would never be able to provide you a car for an hour

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
if the transaction cost was anything.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So, without these wireless technologies, this, as a concept, could never happen.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So, here's another example. This company is GoLoco --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I'm launching it in about three weeks --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
This will apply to people across all of America.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Today, 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to completely change how people feel about ridesharing

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and make that trip much more efficient.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And so when I think about the future,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
is this incredibly great social event out of their day.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
You know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
How fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
How did you go food shopping? You went with your neighbor, what a great social time.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Where can I go today and who can I do it with?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And the social benefits:

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is, I told you, 75 percent;

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I think we can get that down to 50 percent.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The demand for parking, of course, is down, congestion and the CO2 emissions.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
One last piece about this, of course, is that it's enabled by wireless technologies.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The average American spends 19 percent of their income on their car,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and there's a pressure for them to reduce that cost, yet they have no outlet today.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So, the last example of this is congestion pricing, very famously done in London.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
In London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And again, do people like the outcome?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Ken Livingstone was reelected.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So again, we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingness

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
to reduce their driving behavior.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
We've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
There's a huge slack in that system;

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
with the right pricing we can undo that.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and is, again, wirelessly enabled.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and open and shut those gates.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
for something called road pricing.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
because today we pay for our maintenance

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
will be happening with road pricing.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Why do we travel too much?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Car travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
We need to put this better market feedback.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
what mode of travel, where to live and work.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So, I want to move now to the second part of my story,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
which is: when are we going to start doing

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
this congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
10 to 15 years for this to happen

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Because I'm going to say, that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And what kind of wireless technology are we going to use?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This is my big vision.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
There is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
respond to emergencies, get traffic moving,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
provide a new engine for economic growth

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in every sector.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And this is a moment from "The Graduate." Do you remember this moment?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
You guys are going to be the handsome young guy

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and I'm going to be the wise businessman.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
"I want to say one word to you, just one word."

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
"Yes, sir?" "Are you listening?" "Yes I am."

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
"Ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
(Laughter)

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
These are also called mesh networks.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And in a mesh, every device contributes to and expands the network,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I'm going to give you some examples.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
You'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
These laptops, when a child opens them up,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
they communicate with every single child in the classroom,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
within that school, within that village.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And what is the cost of that communication system?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Zero dollars a month.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Here's another example: in New Orleans,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
video cameras were mesh-enabled

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
so that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
When the hurricane happened,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the only communication system standing was the mesh network.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Volunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and for the next 12 months,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Another example is in Portsmouth, U.K.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
You can look at the terminal

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and when it's coming, and you can buy your tickets in real time.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Again, all mesh-enabled. Monthly communication cost: zero.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So, the beauty of mesh networks:

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
you can have these very low-cost devices.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable;

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
you can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
you can keep subtracting them -- as long as there's some, we can still communicate.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
They're resilient; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
What are the incredible weaknesses?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
There isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
or in those municipalities, to build out their cities with these wireless networks --

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
because there's zero ongoing communications cost.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and networks are interesting only as they are big.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
How do we create a big network?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Are you guys ready again -- "The Graduate"?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
This time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
These are the next two lines in the movie.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
"Where did you do it?" "In his car."

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So you know, when you stick this idea ... (Laughter)

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
where would we expect me, Robin Chase, to be thinking

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
is imagine if we put a mesh-network device

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
in every single car across America.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
We could have a coast-to-coast, free wireless communication system.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I guess I just want you to think about that.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And why is this going to happen? Because we're going to do congestion pricing,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
we are going to do road tolls,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
gas taxes are going to become road pricing.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
These things are going to happen.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
What's the wireless technology we're going to use?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Maybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
We should pull it forward.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So, I'd like us to launch the wireless Internet interstate wireless mesh system,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and require that this network be accessible to everyone, with open standards.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Right now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane --

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
What is the point?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
We're transferring just a few little data bits

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
when we're doing road controlling, road pricing.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
We have this incredible excess capacity.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So, we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
we can have resilient nationwide communication systems,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Imagine what happens when the cost of getting information

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
What you can do with that tool: we can create an economic engine.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Information should be free, and access to information should be free,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and we should be charging people for carbon.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and I think this is as important and world changing

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
to our economy as electrification.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And if I had my druthers,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And this open-source version means that

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it --

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
it could be used around the world very quickly.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
So, going back to one of my earlier thoughts.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
-- his fabulous networks --

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
imagine if there was an open-source

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
mesh communications device that can be put into those networks,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
to make all that happen.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
this little slice of things is going to be for free.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
We could make billions of dollars on top of it,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
So, let's take control of this nightmare:

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
implement a gas tax immediately;

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
transition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh;

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
require that the mesh be open to all, with open standards;

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and, of course, use mesh networks.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Thank you. (Applause)
