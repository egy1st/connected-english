WEBVTT

00:00:01.364 --> 00:00:04.637
I just met you on a bus,

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.078
and we would really like 
to get to know each other,

00:00:07.078 --> 00:00:09.564
but I've got to get off at the next stop,

00:00:09.564 --> 00:00:14.331
so you're going to tell me 
three things about yourself

00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:17.911
that just define you as a person,

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:19.689
three things about yourself

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.298
that will help me understand who you are,

00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:27.292
three things that just 
get to your very essence.

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:30.370
And what I'm wondering

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.659
is, of those three things,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.649
is any one of them

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.673
surviving some kind of trauma?

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:46.370
Cancer survivor, rape survivor,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.487
Holocaust survivor, incest survivor.

00:00:51.487 --> 00:00:54.931
Ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves

00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.462
by our wounds?

00:00:57.462 --> 00:01:01.938
And where I have seen this survivor identity

00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:04.426
have the most consequences

00:01:04.426 --> 00:01:06.979
is in the cancer community.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.713
And I've been around this 
community for a long time,

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:12.907
because I've been a hospice 
and a hospital chaplain

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:16.204
for almost 30 years.

00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:21.937
And in 2005, I was working at a big cancer center

00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:24.242
when I received the news that

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:27.677
my mother had breast cancer.

00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:29.859
And then five days later,

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.326
I received the news that I had breast cancer.

00:01:35.326 --> 00:01:37.959
My mother and I can be competitive —

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.747
(Laughter) —

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:44.179
but I was really not trying to
compete with her on this one.

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.204
And in fact, I thought, well,

00:01:46.204 --> 00:01:48.139
if you have to have cancer,

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:49.860
it's pretty convenient to be working

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.371
at a place that treats it.

00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:54.068
But this is what I heard from 
a lot of outraged people.

00:01:54.068 --> 00:01:55.530
What?

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.450
You're the chaplain.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.740
You should be immune.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.817
Like, maybe I should have just gotten off

00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:04.112
with a warning instead of an actual ticket,

00:02:04.112 --> 00:02:07.880
because I'm on the force.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.855
So I did get my treatment at the
cancer center where I worked,

00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:13.376
which was amazingly convenient,

00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:15.615
and I had chemotherapy

00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:18.325
and a mastectomy, and a saline implant put in,

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:20.450
and so before I say another word,
let me just say right now,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.224
this is the fake one. (Laughter)

00:02:25.224 --> 00:02:28.437
I have found that I need to get that out of the way,

00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:30.211
because I'll see somebody go

00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.428
"Oh, I know it's this one."

00:02:32.428 --> 00:02:34.892
And then I'll move or I'll 
gesture and they'll go,

00:02:34.892 --> 00:02:37.445
"No, it's that one."

00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:39.616
So now you know.

00:02:39.616 --> 00:02:41.753
I learned a lot being a patient,

00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:43.275
and one of the surprising things was

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:47.382
that only a small part of the cancer experience

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:49.474
is about medicine.

00:02:49.474 --> 00:02:53.827
Most of it is about feelings and faith

00:02:53.827 --> 00:02:56.460
and losing and finding your identity

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.038
and discovering strength

00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:01.960
and flexibility you never even knew you had.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.289
It's about realizing that

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.359
the most important things in life are

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.440
not things at all, but relationships,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.506
and it's about laughing in the face of uncertainty

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:17.945
and learning that the way to
get out of almost anything

00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:22.260
is to say, "I have cancer."

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.773
So the other thing I learned was that

00:03:24.773 --> 00:03:28.227
I don't have to take on "cancer survivor"

00:03:28.227 --> 00:03:30.195
as my identity,

00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:33.814
but, boy, are there powerful forces

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:37.360
pushing me to do just that.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.678
Now, don't, please, misunderstand me.

00:03:41.678 --> 00:03:43.637
Cancer organizations

00:03:43.637 --> 00:03:45.617
and the drive for early screening

00:03:45.617 --> 00:03:48.271
and cancer awareness and cancer research

00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:50.386
have normalized cancer,

00:03:50.386 --> 00:03:51.710
and this is a wonderful thing.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.794
We can now talk about cancer

00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:55.572
without whispering.

00:03:55.572 --> 00:04:00.090
We can talk about cancer and
we can support one another.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.176
But sometimes, it feels

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.574
like people go a little overboard

00:04:04.574 --> 00:04:09.779
and they start telling us how we're going to feel.

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:13.322
So about a week after my surgery,

00:04:13.322 --> 00:04:16.202
we had a houseguest.

00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:18.950
That was probably our first mistake.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.471
And keep in mind that

00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:22.141
at this point in my life

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:25.763
I had been a chaplain for over 20 years,

00:04:25.763 --> 00:04:28.086
and issues like dying and death

00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:29.642
and the meaning of life,

00:04:29.642 --> 00:04:32.820
these are all things I'd been 
yakking about forever.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.320
So at dinner that night,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.056
our houseguest proceeds to
stretch his arms up over his head,

00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:40.861
and say, "You know, Deb,

00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:45.010
now you're really going to learn what's important.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.707
Yes, you are going to make some big changes

00:04:47.707 --> 00:04:49.077
in your life,

00:04:49.077 --> 00:04:52.725
and now you're going to start
thinking about your death.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:56.750
Yep, this cancer is your wakeup call."

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.175
Now, these are golden words

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:03.154
coming from someone who is speaking about

00:05:03.154 --> 00:05:05.573
their own experience,

00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:07.949
but when someone is telling you

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.342
how you are going to feel,

00:05:10.342 --> 00:05:12.388
it's instant crap.

00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:15.292
The only reason I did not kill him

00:05:15.292 --> 00:05:17.283
with my bare hands

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:21.378
was because I could not lift my right arm.

00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:25.596
But I did say a really bad word to him,

00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:28.497
followed by a regular word, that —

00:05:28.497 --> 00:05:29.720
(Laughter) —

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.238
made my husband say, "She's on narcotics."

00:05:33.238 --> 00:05:35.196
(Laughter)

00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:37.690
And then after my treatment, it just felt like

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.973
everyone was telling me what my
experience was going to mean.

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:43.765
"Oh, this means you're going to be doing the walk."

00:05:43.765 --> 00:05:45.389
"Oh, this means you're coming to the luncheon."

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:46.651
"This means you're going to be wearing

00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:49.042
the pink ribbon and the pink t-shirt

00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:50.904
and the headband and the earrings

00:05:50.904 --> 00:05:54.640
and the bracelet and the panties."

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.869
Panties. No, seriously, google it.

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:59.920
(Laughter)

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.011
How is that raising awareness?

00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:04.078
Only my husband should be seeing my panties.

00:06:04.078 --> 00:06:05.747
(Laughter)

00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:10.158
He's pretty aware of cancer already.

00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:13.302
It was at that point where I felt like, oh my God,

00:06:13.302 --> 00:06:16.452
this is just taking over my life.

00:06:16.452 --> 00:06:21.424
And that's when I told myself, 
claim your experience.

00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:25.086
Don't let it claim you.

00:06:25.086 --> 00:06:27.194
We all know that

00:06:27.194 --> 00:06:31.316
the way to cope with trauma, with loss,

00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:33.741
with any life-changing experience,

00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.891
is to find meaning.

00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:38.128
But here's the thing:

00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:39.795
No one can tell us

00:06:39.795 --> 00:06:42.531
what our experience means.

00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:45.820
We have to decide what it means.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.952
And it doesn't have to be some gigantic,

00:06:47.952 --> 00:06:49.959
extroverted meaning.

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.470
We don't all have to start a foundation

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.622
or an organization or write a book

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:57.502
or make a documentary.

00:06:57.502 --> 00:07:00.449
Meaning can be quiet

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:02.620
and introverted.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.548
Maybe we make one small decision about our lives

00:07:08.548 --> 00:07:13.626
that can bring about big change.

00:07:13.626 --> 00:07:15.566
Many years ago, I had a patient,

00:07:15.566 --> 00:07:17.571
just a wonderful young man

00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:20.306
who was loved by the staff,

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:23.190
and so it was something of a shock to us to realize

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.974
that he had no friends.

00:07:26.974 --> 00:07:29.280
He lived by himself,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.308
he would come in for chemotherapy by himself,

00:07:33.308 --> 00:07:35.253
he would receive his treatment,

00:07:35.253 --> 00:07:38.984
and then he'd walk home alone.

00:07:38.984 --> 00:07:40.748
And I even asked him. I said, "Hey,

00:07:40.748 --> 00:07:43.489
how come you never bring a friend with you?"

00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:48.208
And he said, "I don't really have any friends."

00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:50.469
But he had tons of friends on the infusion floor.

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:54.845
We all loved him, and people were going
in and out of his room all the time.

00:07:54.845 --> 00:07:57.804
So at his last chemo,

00:07:57.804 --> 00:07:59.131
we sang him the song

00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:01.898
and we put the crown on his 
head and we blew the bubbles,

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.339
and then I asked him, I said,

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:08.795
"So what are you going to do now?"

00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:10.605
And he answered,

00:08:10.605 --> 00:08:12.238
"Make friends."

00:08:12.238 --> 00:08:14.350
And he did.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.904
He started volunteering 
and he made friends there,

00:08:17.904 --> 00:08:20.590
and he began going to a church
and he made friends there,

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.550
and at Christmas he invited my husband
and me to a party in his apartment,

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.667
and the place was filled with his friends.

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:30.910
Claim your experience.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.559
Don't let it claim you.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:37.431
He decided that the meaning of his experience

00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:41.198
was to know the joy of friendship,

00:08:41.198 --> 00:08:45.806
and then learn to make friends.

00:08:45.806 --> 00:08:49.792
So what about you?

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:52.145
How are you going to find meaning

00:08:52.145 --> 00:08:54.592
in your crappy experience?

00:08:54.592 --> 00:08:56.483
It could be a recent one,

00:08:56.483 --> 00:08:58.454
or it could be one that you've been carrying around

00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:02.345
for a really long time.

00:09:02.345 --> 00:09:06.855
It's never too late to change what it means,

00:09:06.855 --> 00:09:09.110
because meaning is dynamic.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.771
What it means today

00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:12.698
may not be what it means a year from now,

00:09:12.698 --> 00:09:15.541
or 10 years from now.

00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:18.151
It's never too late to become someone other

00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:21.672
than simply a survivor.

00:09:21.672 --> 00:09:24.996
Hear how static that word sounds?

00:09:24.996 --> 00:09:26.913
Survivor.

00:09:26.913 --> 00:09:31.304
No movement, no growth.

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:33.191
Claim your experience.

00:09:33.191 --> 00:09:35.812
Don't let it claim you, because if you do,

00:09:35.812 --> 00:09:38.973
I believe you will become trapped,

00:09:38.973 --> 00:09:44.915
you will not grow, you will not evolve.

00:09:44.915 --> 00:09:48.393
But of course, sometimes it's not outside pressures

00:09:48.393 --> 00:09:52.764
that cause us to take on that identity of survivor.

00:09:52.764 --> 00:09:56.657
Sometimes we just like the perks.

00:09:56.657 --> 00:10:00.165
Sometimes there's a payoff.

00:10:00.165 --> 00:10:03.900
But then we get stuck.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.711
Now, one of the first things I learned

00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:09.817
as a chaplain intern was the three C's

00:10:09.817 --> 00:10:12.208
of the chaplain's job:

00:10:12.208 --> 00:10:19.170
Comfort, clarify and, when necessary, confront

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.325
or challenge.

00:10:21.325 --> 00:10:23.271
Now, we all pretty much love the comforting

00:10:23.271 --> 00:10:25.128
and the clarifying.

00:10:25.128 --> 00:10:30.070
The confronting, not so much.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.064
One of the other things that I loved

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.522
about being a chaplain was

00:10:34.522 --> 00:10:38.995
seeing patients a year, or even several years

00:10:38.995 --> 00:10:40.836
after their treatment, because

00:10:40.836 --> 00:10:43.536
it was just really cool to see 
how they had changed

00:10:43.536 --> 00:10:45.752
and how their lives had evolved

00:10:45.752 --> 00:10:47.642
and what had happened to them.

00:10:47.642 --> 00:10:50.162
So I was thrilled one day

00:10:50.162 --> 00:10:52.610
to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.191
from a patient who I had seen the year before,

00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:58.665
and she was there with her two adult daughters,

00:10:58.665 --> 00:11:02.924
who I also knew, for her one year follow-up exam.

00:11:02.924 --> 00:11:06.461
So I got down to the lobby, and they were ecstatic

00:11:06.461 --> 00:11:08.712
because she had just gotten
all of her test results back

00:11:08.712 --> 00:11:14.900
and she was NED: No Evidence of Disease.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.657
Which I used to think meant Not Entirely Dead.

00:11:19.657 --> 00:11:25.150
So they were ecstatic, we sat down to visit,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.957
and it was so weird, because

00:11:27.957 --> 00:11:31.839
within two minutes, she 
started retelling me the story

00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:36.369
of her diagnosis and her 
surgery and her chemo,

00:11:36.369 --> 00:11:39.837
even though, as her chaplain, 
I saw her every week,

00:11:39.837 --> 00:11:42.728
and so I knew this story.

00:11:42.728 --> 00:11:45.770
And she was using words like suffering,

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.765
agony, struggle.

00:11:49.765 --> 00:11:52.379
And she ended her story with,

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:57.173
"I felt crucified."

00:11:57.173 --> 00:11:59.837
And at that point, her two 
daughters got up and said,

00:11:59.837 --> 00:12:03.749
"We're going to go get coffee."

00:12:03.749 --> 00:12:06.890
And they left.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.725
Tell me three things about
yourself before the next stop.

00:12:09.725 --> 00:12:12.481
People were leaving the bus before she even got

00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:17.858
to number two or number three.

00:12:17.858 --> 00:12:21.345
So I handed her a tissue,

00:12:21.345 --> 00:12:24.642
and I gave her a hug,

00:12:24.642 --> 00:12:28.152
and then, because I really cared for this woman,

00:12:28.152 --> 00:12:30.238
I said,

00:12:30.238 --> 00:12:32.544
"Get down off your cross."

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:36.810
And she said, "What?"

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:42.224
And I repeated, "Get down off your cross."

00:12:42.224 --> 00:12:46.869
And to her credit, she could 
talk about her reasons

00:12:46.869 --> 00:12:51.988
for embracing and then clinging to this identity.

00:12:51.988 --> 00:12:54.010
It got her a lot of attention.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.115
People were taking care of her for a change.

00:12:57.115 --> 00:13:00.810
But now, it was having the opposite effect.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.293
It was pushing people away.

00:13:03.293 --> 00:13:07.040
People kept leaving to get coffee.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.941
She felt crucified by her experience,

00:13:10.941 --> 00:13:17.163
but she didn't want to let that crucified self die.

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:20.080
Now, perhaps you are thinking

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.030
I was a little harsh with her,

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.138
so I must tell you that

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:28.830
I was speaking out of my own experience.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.674
Many, many years before,

00:13:31.674 --> 00:13:35.000
I had been fired from a job that I loved,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.716
and I would not stop talking about my innocence

00:13:38.716 --> 00:13:42.120
and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt,

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.250
until finally, just like this woman,

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.291
people were walking away from me,

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:48.527
until I finally realized

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:52.399
I wasn't just processing my feelings,

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:55.107
I was feeding them.

00:13:55.107 --> 00:13:59.170
I didn't want to let that crucified self die.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:04.592
But we all know that with any resurrection story,

00:14:04.592 --> 00:14:07.220
you have to die first.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.043
The Christian story,

00:14:09.043 --> 00:14:12.315
Jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb

00:14:12.315 --> 00:14:14.810
before he was resurrected.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.648
And I believe that for us,

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:18.780
being in the tomb

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.766
means doing our own deep inner work

00:14:22.766 --> 00:14:25.470
around our wounds

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.943
and allowing ourselves to be healed.

00:14:29.943 --> 00:14:33.000
We have to let that crucified self die

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.604
so that a new self, a truer self,

00:14:36.604 --> 00:14:38.986
is born.

00:14:38.986 --> 00:14:41.844
We have to let that old story go

00:14:41.844 --> 00:14:45.991
so that a new story, a truer story,

00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:49.030
can be told.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:54.573
Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you.

00:14:54.573 --> 00:14:57.154
What if there were no survivors,

00:14:57.154 --> 00:14:59.950
meaning, what if people decided

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.820
to just claim their trauma as an experience

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.990
instead of taking it on as an identity?

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.992
Maybe it would be the end of being

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:11.350
trapped in our wounds

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.904
and the beginning of amazing

00:15:14.904 --> 00:15:18.830
self-exploration and discovery and growth.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:23.625
Maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves

00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:26.205
by who we have become

00:15:26.205 --> 00:15:30.375
and who we are becoming.

00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:36.146
So perhaps survivor was not

00:15:36.146 --> 00:15:41.353
one of the three things that you would tell me.

00:15:41.353 --> 00:15:42.670
No matter.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.910
I just want you all to know that

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:49.223
I am really glad that we are on this bus together,

00:15:49.223 --> 00:15:53.119
and this is my stop.

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:56.824
(Applause)
