WEBVTT

00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:03.769
So this is Anna Hazare,

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:07.677
and Anna Hazare may well be
the most cutting-edge

00:00:07.677 --> 00:00:10.914
digital activist in the world today.

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:12.452
And you wouldn't know it by looking at him.

00:00:12.452 --> 00:00:18.099
Hazare is a 77-year-old Indian 
anticorruption and social justice activist.

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.690
And in 2011, he was running a big campaign

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.650
to address everyday corruption in India,

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.521
a topic that Indian elites love to ignore.

00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:29.103
So as part of this campaign,

00:00:29.103 --> 00:00:31.025
he was using all of the traditional tactics

00:00:31.025 --> 00:00:33.241
that a good Gandhian organizer would use.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.297
So he was on a hunger strike,

00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:37.822
and Hazare realized through his hunger

00:00:37.822 --> 00:00:39.599
that actually maybe this time,

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:41.345
in the 21st century,

00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:42.834
a hunger strike wouldn't be enough.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:47.126
So he started playing around 
with mobile activism.

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:49.013
So the first thing he did 
is he said to people,

00:00:49.013 --> 00:00:51.084
"Okay, why don't you send me

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.845
a text message if you support

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:54.585
my campaign against corruption?"

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:56.854
So he does this, he 
gives people a short code,

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:59.470
and about 80,000 people do it.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.438
Okay, that's pretty respectable.

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:02.375
But then he decides,

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.495
"Let me tweak my tactics a little bit."

00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:08.970
He says, "Why don't you leave
me a missed call?"

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.039
Now, for those of you who have
lived in the global South,

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.531
you'll know that missed calls

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:17.374
are a really critical part
of global mobile culture.

00:01:17.374 --> 00:01:18.488
I see people nodding.

00:01:18.488 --> 00:01:20.596
People leave missed calls all the time:

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:22.542
If you're running late for a meeting

00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:24.848
and you just want to let them
know that you're on the way,

00:01:24.848 --> 00:01:26.571
you leave them a missed call.

00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:28.497
If you're dating someone and 
you just want to say "I miss you"

00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:29.883
you leave them a missed call.

00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:32.427
So a note for a dating tip here,

00:01:32.427 --> 00:01:33.552
in some cultures,

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:34.834
if you want to please your lover,

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:39.335
you call them and hang up.
(Laughter)

00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:42.690
So why do people leave missed calls?

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.140
Well, the reason of course is that

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.898
they're trying to avoid charges

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:50.264
associated with making calls
and sending texts.

00:01:50.264 --> 00:01:54.320
So when Hazare asked people 
to leave him a missed call,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.997
let's have a little guess how 
many people actually did this?

00:01:59.997 --> 00:02:03.415
Thirty-five million.

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:07.458
So this is one of the largest coordinated
actions in human history.

00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:09.212
It's remarkable.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:13.712
And this reflects the extraordinary strength 
of the emerging Indian middle class

00:02:13.712 --> 00:02:16.684
and the power that their
mobile phones bring.

00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:18.269
But he used that,

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.488
Hazare ended up with this massive 
CSV file of mobile phone numbers,

00:02:22.488 --> 00:02:24.273
and he used that to deploy

00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:26.269
real people power on the ground

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.683
to get hundreds of thousands of
people out on the streets in Delhi

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:34.033
to make a national point of 
everyday corruption in India.

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.470
It's a really striking story.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.680
So this is me when I was 12 years old.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.392
I hope you see the resemblance.

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:42.317
And I was also an activist,

00:02:42.317 --> 00:02:44.557
and I have been an activist all my life.

00:02:44.557 --> 00:02:45.887
I had this really funny childhood

00:02:45.887 --> 00:02:47.910
where I traipsed around the world

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.704
meeting world leaders and 
Noble prize winners,

00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:52.990
talking about Third World debt,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.279
as it was then called,

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.813
and demilitarization.

00:02:55.813 --> 00:03:00.045
I was a very, very serious child.
(Laughter)

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:01.950
And back then,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.384
in the early '90s,

00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:07.214
I had a very cutting-edge
tech tool of my own:

00:03:07.214 --> 00:03:09.466
the fax.

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:11.644
And the fax was the 
tool of my activism.

00:03:11.644 --> 00:03:13.202
And at that time, it was the best way

00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:15.097
to get a message to a lot of people

00:03:15.097 --> 00:03:17.535
all at once.

00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:19.981
I'll give you one example of a fax
campaign that I ran.

00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:22.077
It was the eve of the Gulf War

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:25.628
and I organized a global campaign 
to flood the hotel,

00:03:25.628 --> 00:03:27.109
the Intercontinental in Geneva,

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.664
where James Baker and Tariq Aziz

00:03:28.664 --> 00:03:30.588
were meeting on the eve of the war,

00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:32.972
and I thought if I could 
flood them with faxes,

00:03:32.972 --> 00:03:34.050
we'll stop the war.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.243
Well, unsurprisingly,

00:03:36.243 --> 00:03:39.834
that campaign was wholly unsuccessful.

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:41.488
There are lots of reasons for that,

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:43.973
but there's no doubt that 
one sputtering fax machine

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.300
in Geneva was a little bit
of a bandwidth constraint

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.142
in terms of the ability to 
get a message to lots of people.

00:03:50.142 --> 00:03:54.172
And so, I went on to 
discover some better tools.

00:03:54.172 --> 00:03:56.814
I cofounded Avaaz, which uses the 
Internet to mobilize people

00:03:56.814 --> 00:03:59.412
and now has almost 
40 million members,

00:03:59.412 --> 00:04:01.972
and I now run Purpose, which 
is a home for these kinds of

00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:04.268
technology-powered movements.

00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:06.088
So what's the moral of this story?

00:04:06.088 --> 00:04:07.596
Is the moral of this story,


00:04:07.596 --> 00:04:12.705
you know what, the fax is kind of
eclipsed by the mobile phone?

00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:14.935
This is another story of 
tech-determinism?

00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:18.125
Well, I would argue that there's 
actually more to it than that.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.798
I'd argue that in the last 20 years,

00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:23.036
something more fundamental has changed


00:04:23.036 --> 00:04:24.741
than just new tech.

00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:27.561
I would argue that there has
been a fundamental shift

00:04:27.561 --> 00:04:29.709
in the balance of power

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:31.228
in the world.

00:04:31.228 --> 00:04:33.145
You ask any activist how 
to understand the world,

00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:35.619
and they'll say,
"Look at where the power is,

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:38.077
who has it, how it's shifting."

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:41.079
And I think we all sense that 
something big is happening.

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:43.523
So Henry Timms and I —

00:04:43.523 --> 00:04:45.371
Henry's a fellow movement builder —

00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:47.273
got talking one day and 
we started to think,

00:04:47.273 --> 00:04:49.274
how can we make sense of this new world?

00:04:49.274 --> 00:04:50.463
How can we describe it and give

00:04:50.463 --> 00:04:52.906
it a framework that makes it more useful?

00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:54.136
Because we realized that many

00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:56.950
of the lessons that we were
discovering in movements

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.657
actually applied all over the world

00:04:59.657 --> 00:05:01.779
in many sectors of our society.

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.656
So I want to introduce you to
this framework:

00:05:03.656 --> 00:05:05.876
Old power, meet new power.

00:05:05.876 --> 00:05:09.307
And I want to talk to you about
what new power is today.

00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:11.271
New power is the deployment

00:05:11.271 --> 00:05:14.460
of mass participation 
and peer coordination —

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.102
these are the two key elements —

00:05:16.102 --> 00:05:18.599
to create change and shift outcomes.

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.687
And we see new power all around us.

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:22.971
This is Beppe Grillo

00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:25.116
he was a populist Italian blogger

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:28.536
who, with a minimal political apparatus
and only some online tools,

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:31.034
won more than 25 percent of the vote

00:05:31.034 --> 00:05:33.455
in recent Italian elections.

00:05:33.455 --> 00:05:34.817
This is Airbnb,

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:36.566
which in just a few years

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:38.728
has radically disrupted the hotel industry

00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:41.646
without owning a single
square foot of real estate.

00:05:41.646 --> 00:05:43.001
This is Kickstarter,

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:45.898
which we know has raised over a billion dollars

00:05:45.898 --> 00:05:48.319
from more than five million people.

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:50.249
Now, we're familiar with all of these models.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.450
But what's striking is the commonalities,

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.576
the structural features of 
these new models

00:05:55.576 --> 00:05:57.725
and how they differ from old power.

00:05:57.725 --> 00:05:59.394
Let's look a little bit at this.

00:05:59.394 --> 00:06:02.552
Old power is held like a currency.

00:06:02.552 --> 00:06:04.531
New power works like a current.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.033
Old power is held by a few.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:10.473
New power isn't held by a few,
it's made by many.

00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:12.980
Old power is all about download,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.706
and new power uploads.

00:06:14.706 --> 00:06:17.240
And you see a whole set of 
characteristics that you can trace,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.356
whether it's in media or 
politics or education.

00:06:20.356 --> 00:06:22.422
So we've talked a little bit 
about what new power is.

00:06:22.422 --> 00:06:25.587
Let's, for a second, talk about 
what new power isn't.

00:06:25.587 --> 00:06:29.383
New power is not your Facebook page.

00:06:29.383 --> 00:06:32.208
I assure you that having a 
social media strategy

00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:34.756
can enable you to do just as much download

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:37.618
as you used to do when you had the radio.

00:06:37.618 --> 00:06:41.146
Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,

00:06:41.146 --> 00:06:42.888
I assure you that his Facebook page

00:06:42.888 --> 00:06:47.015
has not embraced the power
of participation.

00:06:47.015 --> 00:06:50.413
New power is not inherently positive.

00:06:50.413 --> 00:06:52.702
In fact, this isn't an normative
argument that we're making,

00:06:52.702 --> 00:06:54.514
there are many good things 
about new power,

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:56.331
but it can produce bad outcomes.

00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:58.336
More participation, more peer coordination,

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:00.123
sometimes distorts outcomes

00:07:00.123 --> 00:07:01.198
and there are some things,

00:07:01.198 --> 00:07:03.297
like things, for example, 
in the medical profession

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:06.293
that we want new power 
to get nowhere near.

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:09.296
And thirdly, new power is not
the inevitable victor.

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:10.875
In fact, unsurprisingly,

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:13.864
as many of these new power
models get to scale,

00:07:13.864 --> 00:07:16.334
what you see is this massive pushback

00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:18.083
from the forces of old power.

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:20.292
Just look at this really 
interesting epic struggle

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:24.675
going on right now between 
Edward Snowden and the NSA.

00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:27.059
You'll note that only one of 
the two people on this slide

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:29.238
is currently in exile.

00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:30.653
And so, it's not at all clear

00:07:30.653 --> 00:07:32.743
that new power will be 
the inevitable victor.

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:35.686
That said, keep one thing in mind:


00:07:35.686 --> 00:07:38.575
We're at the beginning of a
very steep curve.

00:07:38.575 --> 00:07:40.216
So you think about some of 
these new power models, right?

00:07:40.216 --> 00:07:42.328
These were just like someone's

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.874
garage idea a few years ago,

00:07:44.874 --> 00:07:48.010
and now they're disrupting 
entire industries.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.679
And so, what's interesting
about new power,

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.695
is the way it feeds
on itself.

00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:54.719
Once you have an experience of new power,

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:56.909
you tend to expect and 
want more of it.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.789
So let's say you've used a
peer-to-peer lending platform

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:02.323
like Lending Tree or Prosper,

00:08:02.323 --> 00:08:04.607
then you've figured out that
you don't need the bank,

00:08:04.607 --> 00:08:06.544
and who wants the bank, right?

00:08:06.544 --> 00:08:08.982
And so, that experience tends 
to embolden you

00:08:08.982 --> 00:08:11.919
it tends to make you want
more participation

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:14.264
across more aspects of your life.

00:08:14.264 --> 00:08:15.809
And what this gives rise to is

00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:17.380
a set of values.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.690
We talked about the models

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.284
that new power has engendered —

00:08:20.284 --> 00:08:22.116
the Airbnbs, the Kickstarters.

00:08:22.116 --> 00:08:23.645
What about the values?

00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:25.315
And this is an early sketch

00:08:25.315 --> 00:08:27.878
at what new power values look like.

00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:31.009
New power values prize
transparency above all else.

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:33.231
It's almost a religious 
belief in transparency,

00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:35.495
a belief that if you shine 
a light on something,

00:08:35.495 --> 00:08:36.926
it will be better.

00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:39.676
And remember that in the 20th 
century, this was not at all true.

00:08:39.676 --> 00:08:42.643
People thought that gentlemen
should sit behind closed doors

00:08:42.643 --> 00:08:44.925
and make comfortable agreements.

00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:48.330
New power values of informal,
networked governance.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.974
New power folks would never 
have invented the U.N. today,

00:08:50.974 --> 00:08:52.807
for better or worse.

00:08:52.807 --> 00:08:54.522
New power values participation,

00:08:54.522 --> 00:08:57.317
and new power is all about do-it-yourself.

00:08:57.317 --> 00:08:58.806
In fact, what's interesting 
about new power

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:02.519
is that it eschews some of 
the professionalization

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:03.994
and specialization that was

00:09:03.994 --> 00:09:06.384
all the rage in the 20th century.

00:09:06.384 --> 00:09:08.194
So what's interesting about these

00:09:08.194 --> 00:09:10.160
new power values and these
new power models

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.455
is what they mean for organizations.

00:09:12.455 --> 00:09:14.963
So we've spent a bit of time thinking,

00:09:14.963 --> 00:09:17.229
how can we plot organizations

00:09:17.229 --> 00:09:19.493
on a two-by-two where, essentially,

00:09:19.493 --> 00:09:21.549
we look at new power values

00:09:21.549 --> 00:09:22.813
and new power models

00:09:22.813 --> 00:09:24.614
and see where different people sit?

00:09:24.614 --> 00:09:26.503
We started with a U.S. analysis,

00:09:26.503 --> 00:09:28.879
and let me show you 
some interesting findings.

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:30.858
So the first is Apple.

00:09:30.858 --> 00:09:33.393
In this framework, we actually
described Apple

00:09:33.393 --> 00:09:35.515
as an old power company.

00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:37.169
That's because the ideology,

00:09:37.169 --> 00:09:39.457
the governing ideology of Apple

00:09:39.457 --> 00:09:42.331
is the ideology of the perfectionist

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.355
product designer in Cupertino.

00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:48.427
It's absolutely about that beautiful, 
perfect thing descending upon us

00:09:48.427 --> 00:09:49.778
in perfection.

00:09:49.778 --> 00:09:52.401
And it does not value, as a 
company, transparency.

00:09:52.401 --> 00:09:54.064
In fact, it's very secretive.

00:09:54.064 --> 00:09:56.890
Now, Apple is one of the most
succesful companies in the world.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.262
So this shows that you can


00:09:58.262 --> 00:10:00.951
still pursue a successful 
old power strategy.

00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:03.921
But one can argue that there's 
real vulnerabilites in that model.

00:10:03.921 --> 00:10:05.945
I think another interesting comparison

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:08.122
is that of the Obama campaign

00:10:08.122 --> 00:10:11.238
versus the Obama presidency.

00:10:11.238 --> 00:10:18.700
(Applause)

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.447
Now, I like President Obama,

00:10:20.447 --> 00:10:24.403
but he ran with new 
power at his back, right?

00:10:24.403 --> 00:10:26.230
And he said to people,


00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.203
we are the ones we've
been waiting for.

00:10:28.203 --> 00:10:29.654
And he used crowdfunding

00:10:29.654 --> 00:10:30.865
to power a campaign.

00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:32.266
But when he got into office,

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:35.458
he governed like more or less 
all the other presidents did.

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:37.822
And this is a really interesting trend,

00:10:37.822 --> 00:10:39.820
is when new power gets powerful,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.391
what happens?


00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.155
So this is a framework you 
should look at

00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:44.647
and think about where your
own organization

00:10:44.647 --> 00:10:45.611
sits on it.

00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:47.184
And think about where it
should be 


00:10:47.184 --> 00:10:48.732
in five or 10 years.

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:51.197
So what do you do if you're old power?

00:10:51.197 --> 00:10:54.162
Well, if you're there 
thinking, in old power,

00:10:54.162 --> 00:10:56.062
this won't happen to us.

00:10:56.062 --> 00:11:01.229
Then just look at the Wikipedia
entry for Encyclopædia Britannica.

00:11:01.229 --> 00:11:03.625
Let me tell you, it's a very sad read.

00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:05.044
But if you are old power,

00:11:05.044 --> 00:11:08.837
the most important thing you 
can do is to occupy yourself

00:11:08.837 --> 00:11:11.491
before others occupy you,

00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:12.819
before you are occupied.

00:11:12.819 --> 00:11:15.592
Imagine that a group
of your biggest skeptics

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:17.944
are camped in the heart
of your organization

00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:19.823
asking the toughest questions

00:11:19.823 --> 00:11:22.751
and they can see everything
inside of your organization.

00:11:22.751 --> 00:11:25.501
And ask them, would they 
like what they see

00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:27.776
and should our model change?

00:11:27.776 --> 00:11:29.639
What about if you're new power?


00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:32.273
Is new power kind of just 
riding the wave to glory?

00:11:32.273 --> 00:11:33.753
I would argue no.

00:11:33.753 --> 00:11:35.709
I would argue that there
are some very real challenges

00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:37.401
to new power in this nascent phase.

00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:40.903
Let's stick with the Occupy Wall Street
example for a moment.

00:11:40.903 --> 00:11:43.893
Occupy was this incredible example 
of new power,

00:11:43.893 --> 00:11:45.736
the purest example of new power.

00:11:45.736 --> 00:11:48.267
And yet, it failed to consolidate.

00:11:48.267 --> 00:11:50.164
So the energy that it created

00:11:50.164 --> 00:11:51.605
was great for the meme phase,

00:11:51.605 --> 00:11:54.406
but they were so committed to participation,

00:11:54.406 --> 00:11:56.040
that they never got anything done.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.831
And in fact that model

00:11:57.831 --> 00:12:00.623
means that the challenge for new power is:

00:12:00.623 --> 00:12:03.162
how do you use institutional power

00:12:03.162 --> 00:12:05.233
without being institutionalized?


00:12:05.233 --> 00:12:07.866
One the other end of the spectra is Uber.

00:12:07.866 --> 00:12:09.250
Uber is an amazing,

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.303
highly scalable new power model.

00:12:11.303 --> 00:12:13.329
That network is getting denser and denser

00:12:13.329 --> 00:12:14.589
by the day.

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:16.748
But what's really interesting 
about Uber is

00:12:16.748 --> 00:12:20.489
it hasn't really adopted new power values.

00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:24.561
This is a real quote from 
the Uber CEO recently:

00:12:24.561 --> 00:12:29.009
He says, "Once we get rid of the dude 
in the car" — he means drivers —

00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:32.901
"Uber will be cheaper."

00:12:32.901 --> 00:12:35.876
Now, new power models
live and die

00:12:35.876 --> 00:12:38.058
by the strength of their networks.

00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:39.991
By whether the drivers and the consumers


00:12:39.991 --> 00:12:42.332
who use the service actually believe in it.

00:12:42.332 --> 00:12:45.833
Because they're not an exercise 
of top-down perfectionism,

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.781
they are about the network.

00:12:47.781 --> 00:12:49.477
And so, the challenge,

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.727
and this is why it's in
no way surprising,

00:12:51.727 --> 00:12:55.983
is that Uber's drivers 
are now unionizing.

00:12:55.983 --> 00:12:57.583
It's extraordinary.

00:12:57.583 --> 00:12:59.872
Uber's drivers are turning on Uber.

00:12:59.872 --> 00:13:01.166
And the challenge for Uber —

00:13:01.166 --> 00:13:03.093
this isn't an easy situation for them —

00:13:03.093 --> 00:13:06.389
is that they are locked into
a broader superstrcuture

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:08.074
that is really old power.

00:13:08.074 --> 00:13:11.082
They've raised more than a billion 
dollars in the capital markets.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.610
Those markets expect a financial return,

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.527
and they way you get a financial return

00:13:15.527 --> 00:13:17.924
is by squeezing and squeezing

00:13:17.924 --> 00:13:20.169
your users and your drivers

00:13:20.169 --> 00:13:21.464
for more and more value

00:13:21.464 --> 00:13:23.931
and giving that value to your investors.

00:13:23.931 --> 00:13:27.534
So the big question about the future 
of new power, in my view, is:

00:13:27.534 --> 00:13:30.093
Will that old power just emerge?


00:13:30.093 --> 00:13:31.876
So will new power elites just become

00:13:31.876 --> 00:13:33.765
old power and squeeze?

00:13:33.765 --> 00:13:36.378
Or will that new power
base bite back?

00:13:36.378 --> 00:13:38.139
Will the next big Uber

00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:40.519
be co-owned by Uber drivers?

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:43.302
And I think this going 
to be a very interesting

00:13:43.302 --> 00:13:45.204
structural question.

00:13:45.204 --> 00:13:48.486
Finally, think about new power

00:13:48.486 --> 00:13:50.853
being more than just an

00:13:50.853 --> 00:13:52.489
entity that scales things 


00:13:52.489 --> 00:13:56.205
that make us have slightly 
better consumer experiences.

00:13:56.205 --> 00:13:58.371
My call to action for new power

00:13:58.371 --> 00:14:00.779
is to not be an island.

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:03.935
We have major structural
problems in the world today

00:14:03.935 --> 00:14:06.191
that could benefit enormously

00:14:06.191 --> 00:14:08.505
from the kinds of mass participation

00:14:08.505 --> 00:14:09.842
and peer coordination

00:14:09.842 --> 00:14:11.570
that these new power players

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.966
know so well how to generate.

00:14:13.966 --> 00:14:17.479
And we badly need them to 
turn their energies and their power

00:14:17.479 --> 00:14:20.703
to big, what economists might call

00:14:20.703 --> 00:14:22.276
public goods problems,

00:14:22.276 --> 00:14:24.322
that are often beyond markets

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:26.332
where investors can easily be found.

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:28.222
And I think if we can do that,

00:14:28.222 --> 00:14:31.207
we might be able to fundamentally change

00:14:31.207 --> 00:14:34.738
not only human beings' sense of 
their own agency and power —

00:14:34.738 --> 00:14:37.596
because I think that's the most
wonderful thing about new power,

00:14:37.596 --> 00:14:40.348
is that people feel more powerful —

00:14:40.348 --> 00:14:42.129
but we might also be able to change

00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:43.892
the way we relate to each other

00:14:43.892 --> 00:14:47.003
and the way we relate to 
authority and institutions.

00:14:47.003 --> 00:14:49.051
And to me, that's absolutely

00:14:49.051 --> 00:14:50.622
worth trying for.

00:14:50.622 --> 00:14:51.718
Thank you very much.

00:14:51.718 --> 00:14:53.810
(Applause)
