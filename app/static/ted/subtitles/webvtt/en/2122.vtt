WEBVTT

00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:03.057
I grew up

00:00:03.057 --> 00:00:07.860
diagnosed as phobically shy,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.514
and, like at least 20 other people

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:12.938
in a room of this size,

00:00:12.938 --> 00:00:14.558
I was a stutterer.

00:00:14.558 --> 00:00:17.218
Do you dare raise your hand?

00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:21.274
And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us,

00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:26.126
because when we are treated that way,

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:29.190
we feel invisible sometimes,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.823
or talked around and at.

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:34.648
And as I started to look at people,

00:00:34.648 --> 00:00:37.394
which is mostly all I did,

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:39.632
I noticed that some people

00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:44.986
really wanted attention and recognition.

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:47.170
Remember, I was young then.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.207
So what did they do?

00:00:48.207 --> 00:00:50.847
What we still do perhaps too often.

00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:53.580
We talk about ourselves.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.957
And yet there are other people I observed

00:00:55.957 --> 00:00:59.546
who had what I called a mutuality mindset.

00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:03.142
In each situation, they found a way to talk about us

00:01:03.142 --> 00:01:05.532
and create that "us" idea.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.627
So my idea to reimagine the world

00:01:07.627 --> 00:01:10.493
is to see it one where we all become

00:01:10.493 --> 00:01:15.078
greater opportunity-makers with and for others.

00:01:15.078 --> 00:01:17.658
There's no greater opportunity

00:01:17.658 --> 00:01:20.974
or call for action for us now

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:23.340
than to become opportunity-makers

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.990
who use best talents together more often

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.212
for the greater good

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:30.291
and accomplish things we
couldn't have done on our own.

00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:32.765
And I want to talk to you about that,

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:35.165
because even more than giving,

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:38.930
even more than giving,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.902
is the capacity for us to do something smarter

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:46.406
together for the greater good

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.277
that lifts us both up

00:01:48.277 --> 00:01:50.147
and that can scale.

00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:51.925
That's why I'm sitting here.

00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:55.717
But I also want to point something else out:

00:01:55.717 --> 00:01:58.226
Each one of you

00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:02.740
is better than anybody else at something.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.724
That disproves that popular notion

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:08.660
that if you're the smartest person in the room,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.684
you're in the wrong room.

00:02:10.684 --> 00:02:12.901
(Laughter)

00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:15.111
So let me tell you about

00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:17.749
a Hollywood party I went to a couple years back,

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.110
and I met this up-and-coming actress,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.800
and we were soon talking about something

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.641
that we both felt passionately about: public art.

00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:27.032
And she had the fervent belief

00:02:27.032 --> 00:02:30.618
that every new building in Los Angeles

00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:31.950
should have public art in it.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.698
She wanted a regulation for it,

00:02:33.698 --> 00:02:35.253
and she fervently started —

00:02:35.253 --> 00:02:37.155
who is here from Chicago? —

00:02:37.155 --> 00:02:39.479
she fervently started talking about

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.464
these bean-shaped reflective sculptures

00:02:42.464 --> 00:02:44.127
in Millennium Park,

00:02:44.127 --> 00:02:46.360
and people would walk up to it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.651
and they'd smile in the reflection of it,

00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:50.260
and they'd pose and they'd vamp

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.702
and they'd take selfies together,

00:02:52.702 --> 00:02:56.080
and they'd laugh.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.764
And as she was talking, a 
thought came to my mind.

00:02:58.764 --> 00:03:01.783
I said, "I know someone you ought to meet.

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:04.298
He's getting out of San Quentin 
in a couple of weeks" —

00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:06.278
(Laughter) —

00:03:06.278 --> 00:03:08.740
"and he shares your fervent desire

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.936
that art should engage and
enable people to connect."

00:03:11.936 --> 00:03:16.070
He spent five years in solitary,

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.080
and I met him because I gave
a speech at San Quentin,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.610
and he's articulate

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.898
and he's rather easy on 
the eyes because he's buff.

00:03:24.898 --> 00:03:27.482
He had workout regime he did every day.

00:03:27.482 --> 00:03:29.519
(Laughter)

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.396
I think she was following me at that point.

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:33.939
I said, "He'd be an unexpected ally."

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.784
And not just that. There's James. He's an architect

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:40.260
and he's a professor, and he loves place-making,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.463
and place-making is when you have

00:03:41.463 --> 00:03:45.057
those mini-plazas and those urban walkways

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:47.257
and where they're dotted with art,

00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:51.150
where people draw and 
come up and talk sometimes.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.545
I think they'd make good allies.

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:56.696
And indeed they were.

00:03:56.696 --> 00:03:58.866
They met together. They prepared.

00:03:58.866 --> 00:04:02.510
They spoke in front of the 
Los Angeles City Council.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.225
And the council members not
only passed the regulation,

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:09.308
half of them came down and asked
to pose with them afterwards.

00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:14.764
They were startling, 
compelling and credible.

00:04:14.764 --> 00:04:18.206
You can't buy that.

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:20.276
What I'm asking you to consider

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:22.973
is what kind of opportunity-
makers we might become,

00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:25.820
because more than wealth

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.869
or fancy titles

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:33.909
or a lot of contacts, it's our capacity to connect

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.249
around each other's 
better side and bring it out.

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:38.551
And I'm not saying this is easy,

00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:41.106
and I'm sure many of you have
made the wrong moves too

00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:43.980
about who you wanted to connect with,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.574
but what I want to suggest is,

00:04:46.574 --> 00:04:49.920
this is an opportunity.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.144
I started thinking about it

00:04:52.144 --> 00:04:54.686
way back when I was a 
Wall Street Journal reporter

00:04:54.686 --> 00:04:57.104
and I was in Europe and I was
supposed to cover trends

00:04:57.104 --> 00:04:59.647
and trends that transcended business

00:04:59.647 --> 00:05:01.941
or politics or lifestyle.

00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:04.315
So I had to have contacts

00:05:04.315 --> 00:05:06.283
in different worlds very different than mine,

00:05:06.283 --> 00:05:08.657
because otherwise you couldn't spot the trends.

00:05:08.657 --> 00:05:11.627
And third, I had to write the story

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:13.664
in a way stepping into the reader's shoes,

00:05:13.664 --> 00:05:17.754
so they could see how these 
trends could affect their lives.

00:05:17.754 --> 00:05:21.274
That's what opportunity-makers do.

00:05:21.274 --> 00:05:24.703
And here's a strange thing:

00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:27.919
Unlike an increasing number of Americans

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.365
who are working and living 
and playing with people

00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:33.634
who think exactly like them

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:36.306
because we then become more rigid and extreme,

00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:40.006
opportunity-makers are actively seeking situations

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:42.263
with people unlike them,

00:05:42.263 --> 00:05:44.106
and they're building relationships,

00:05:44.106 --> 00:05:46.334
and because they do that,

00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:48.212
they have trusted relationships

00:05:48.212 --> 00:05:50.363
where they can bring the right team in

00:05:50.363 --> 00:05:54.180
and recruit them to solve a 
problem better and faster

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.755
and seize more opportunities.

00:05:55.755 --> 00:06:03.374
They're not affronted by differences,

00:06:03.374 --> 00:06:05.607
they're fascinated by them,

00:06:05.607 --> 00:06:08.513
and that is a huge shift in mindset,

00:06:08.513 --> 00:06:11.415
and once you feel it, you 
want it to happen a lot more.

00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:16.469
This world is calling out for us 
to have a collective mindset,

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:18.851
and I believe in doing that.

00:06:18.851 --> 00:06:21.156
It's especially important now.

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:23.968
Why is it important now?

00:06:23.968 --> 00:06:28.515
Because things can be devised like drones

00:06:28.515 --> 00:06:32.529
and drugs and data collection,

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:34.644
and they can be devised by more people

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:38.637
and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes

00:06:38.637 --> 00:06:40.977
and then, as we know from the news every day,

00:06:40.977 --> 00:06:43.124
they can be used for dangerous ones.

00:06:43.124 --> 00:06:46.468
It calls on us, each of us,

00:06:46.468 --> 00:06:49.204
to a higher calling.

00:06:49.204 --> 00:06:51.960
But here's the icing on the cake:

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.216
It's not just the first opportunity

00:06:54.216 --> 00:06:56.367
that you do with somebody else

00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:58.123
that's probably your greatest,

00:06:58.123 --> 00:07:00.767
as an institution or an individual.

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:02.959
It's after you've had that experience

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:04.904
and you trust each other.

00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:06.715
It's the unexpected things

00:07:06.715 --> 00:07:08.539
that you devise later on

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:10.733
you never could have predicted.

00:07:10.733 --> 00:07:16.343
For example, Marty is the husband 
of that actress I mentioned,

00:07:16.343 --> 00:07:18.673
and he watched them 
when they were practicing,

00:07:18.673 --> 00:07:20.192
and he was soon talking to Wally,

00:07:20.192 --> 00:07:21.586
my friend the ex-con,

00:07:21.586 --> 00:07:24.048
about that exercise regime.

00:07:24.048 --> 00:07:25.356
And he thought,

00:07:25.356 --> 00:07:27.536
I have a set of racquetball courts.

00:07:27.536 --> 00:07:28.860
That guy could teach it.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.313
A lot of people who work there
are members at my courts.

00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:33.982
They're frequent travelers.

00:07:33.982 --> 00:07:35.834
They could practice in their hotel room,

00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:37.950
no equipment provided.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.547
That's how Wally got hired.

00:07:40.547 --> 00:07:41.936
Not only that, years later

00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:44.165
he was also teaching racquetball.

00:07:44.165 --> 00:07:45.576
Years after that,

00:07:45.576 --> 00:07:48.657
he was teaching the racquetball teachers.

00:07:48.657 --> 00:07:53.612
What I'm suggesting is, when 
you connect with people

00:07:53.612 --> 00:07:57.719
around a shared interest and action,

00:07:57.719 --> 00:08:00.059
you're accustomed to serendipitous

00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:02.433
things happening into the future,

00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:04.717
and I think that's what we're looking at.

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:07.361
We open ourselves up to those opportunities,

00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:11.208
and in this room 
are key players in technology,

00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:14.296
key players who are uniquely positioned to do this,

00:08:14.296 --> 00:08:18.079
to scale systems and projects together.

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:20.572
So here's what I'm calling for you to do.

00:08:20.572 --> 00:08:23.928
Remember the three traits of opportunity-makers.

00:08:23.928 --> 00:08:28.817
Opportunity-makers keep honing their top strength

00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:32.541
and they become pattern seekers.

00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:36.883
They get involved in different 
worlds than their worlds

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:39.485
so they're trusted and they 
can see those patterns,

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:41.394
and they communicate to connect

00:08:41.394 --> 00:08:44.540
around sweet spots of shared interest.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.356
So what I'm asking you is,

00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:49.178
the world is hungry.

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:51.945
I truly believe, in my firsthand experience,

00:08:51.945 --> 00:08:54.656
the world is hungry for us

00:08:54.656 --> 00:08:57.312
to unite together as opportunity-makers

00:08:57.312 --> 00:08:59.316
and to emulate those behaviors

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:00.922
as so many of you already do —

00:09:00.922 --> 00:09:03.948
I know that firsthand —

00:09:03.948 --> 00:09:05.770
and to reimagine a world

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.964
where we use our best talents together

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:11.278
more often to accomplish greater things together

00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:14.994
than we could on our own.

00:09:14.994 --> 00:09:17.304
Just remember,

00:09:17.304 --> 00:09:20.000
as Dave Liniger once said,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.429
"You can't succeed

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:25.568
coming to the potluck with only a fork."

00:09:25.568 --> 00:09:27.525
(Laughter)

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.096
Thank you very much.

00:09:29.096 --> 00:09:33.231
Thank you. (Applause)
