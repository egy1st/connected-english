WEBVTT

00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:02.993
About 12 years ago,

00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:05.245
I gave up my career in banking

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:08.356
to try to make the world a safer place.

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:12.565
This involved a journey into
national and global advocacy

00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:17.388
and meeting some of the most
extraordinary people in the world.

00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:22.566
In the process, I became
a civil society diplomat.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:26.072
Civil society diplomats do three things:

00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:28.603
They voice the concerns of the people,

00:00:28.603 --> 00:00:31.691
are not pinned down by national interests,

00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:34.528
and influence change
through citizen networks,

00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:37.084
not only state ones.

00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:41.683
And if you want to change the world,
we need more of them.

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:44.190
But many people still ask,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.741
"Can civil society really
make a big difference?

00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:54.012
Can citizens influence and shape
national and global policy?"

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.961
I never thought I would ask
myself these questions,

00:00:56.961 --> 00:01:00.211
but here I am to share some lessons

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:05.227
about two powerful civil society 
movements that I've been involved in.

00:01:05.227 --> 00:01:09.035
They are in issues
that I'm passionate about:

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:13.214
gun control and drug policy.

00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:16.859
And these are issues that matter here.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.253
Latin America is ground zero
for both of them.

00:01:22.253 --> 00:01:24.296
For example, Brazil --

00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:30.550
this beautiful country hosting TEDGlobal
has the world's ugliest record.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.448
We are the number one champion
in homicidal violence.

00:01:36.448 --> 00:01:42.564
One in every 10 people killed
around the world is a Brazilian.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.678
This translates into over 56,000 people

00:01:47.678 --> 00:01:51.161
dying violently each year.

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:57.082
Most of them are young, black boys
dying by guns.

00:01:57.082 --> 00:02:02.213
Brazil is also one of the world's
largest consumers of drugs,

00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:07.066
and the War on Drugs
has been especially painful here.

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:10.339
Around 50 percent of the homicides
in the streets in Brazil

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.776
are related to the War on Drugs.

00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:19.464
The same is true for about
25 percent of people in jail.

00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:24.596
And it's not just Brazil that is affected
by the twin problems of guns and drugs.

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:31.620
Virtually every country and city across
Central and South America is in trouble.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.869
Latin America has nine percent
of the world's population,

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:40.930
but 25 percent
of its global violent deaths.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.972
These are not problems
we can run away from.

00:02:43.972 --> 00:02:46.271
I certainly could not.

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:51.147
So the first campaign I got involved with
started here in 2003

00:02:51.147 --> 00:02:53.190
to change Brazil's gun law

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.278
and to create a program
to buy back weapons.

00:02:56.278 --> 00:02:57.857
In just a few years,

00:02:57.857 --> 00:03:00.295
we not only changed national legislation

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:04.033
that made it much more difficult
for civilians to buy a gun,

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:09.683
but we collected and destroyed
almost half a million weapons.

00:03:09.683 --> 00:03:14.262
This was one of the biggest
buyback programs in history --

00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:16.921
(Applause) --

00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:20.542
but we also suffered some setbacks.

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:26.324
We lost a referendum to ban
gun sales to civilians in 2005.

00:03:26.324 --> 00:03:29.597
The second initiative was also home-grown,

00:03:29.597 --> 00:03:35.147
but is today a global movement to reform
the international drug control regime.

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:36.938
I am the executive coordinator

00:03:36.938 --> 00:03:41.416
of something called
the Global Commission on Drug Policy.

00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:43.854
The commission is a high-level group

00:03:43.854 --> 00:03:47.755
of global leaders brought together
to identify more humane

00:03:47.755 --> 00:03:51.911
and effective approaches
to the issue of drugs.

00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:56.479
Since we started in 2008,
the taboo on drugs is broken.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:01.431
Across the Americas, from the US
and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay,

00:04:01.431 --> 00:04:03.579
change is in the air.

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.381
But rather than tell you the whole story
about these two movements,

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:11.189
I just want to share with you
four key insights.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.788
I call them lessons to change the world.

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.017
There are certainly many more,

00:04:17.017 --> 00:04:20.314
but these are the ones
that stand out to me.

00:04:20.314 --> 00:04:22.496
So the first lesson is:

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:25.770
Change and control the narrative.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.604
It may seem obvious,

00:04:27.604 --> 00:04:30.646
but a key ingredient
to civil society diplomacy

00:04:30.646 --> 00:04:34.733
is first changing and then
controlling the narrative.

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:37.890
This is something that veteran
politicians understand,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.813
but that civil society groups
generally do not do very well.

00:04:42.813 --> 00:04:45.158
In the case of drug policy,

00:04:45.158 --> 00:04:48.618
our biggest success has been
to change the discussion

00:04:48.618 --> 00:04:51.427
away from prosecuting a War on Drugs

00:04:51.427 --> 00:04:55.398
to putting people's health
and safety first.

00:04:55.398 --> 00:04:58.834
In a cutting-edge report
we just launched in New York,

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:06.403
we also showed that the groups benefiting
most from this $320 billion market

00:05:06.403 --> 00:05:09.724
are criminal gangs and cartels.

00:05:09.724 --> 00:05:13.462
So in order to undermine
the power and profit of these groups,

00:05:13.462 --> 00:05:16.434
we need to change the conversation.

00:05:16.434 --> 00:05:22.726
We need to make illegal drugs legal.

00:05:22.726 --> 00:05:25.559
But before I get you too excited,

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.694
I don't mean drugs
should be a free-for-all.

00:05:28.702 --> 00:05:32.827
What I'm talking about, and what
the Global Commission advocates for

00:05:32.827 --> 00:05:37.354
is creating a highly regulated market,

00:05:37.354 --> 00:05:42.579
where different drugs would have
different degrees of regulation.

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:46.619
As for gun control,
we were successful in changing,

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:49.544
but not so much
in controlling, the narrative.

00:05:49.544 --> 00:05:52.400
And this brings me to my next lesson:

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.324
Never underestimate your opponents.

00:05:56.324 --> 00:05:58.553
If you want to succeed
in changing the world,

00:05:58.553 --> 00:06:00.922
you need to know who you're up against.

00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:04.590
You need to learn their motivations
and points of view.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.796
In the case of gun control,

00:06:06.796 --> 00:06:10.349
we really underestimated our opponents.

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.274
After a very successful
gun-collection program,

00:06:13.274 --> 00:06:14.618
we were elated.

00:06:14.618 --> 00:06:17.454
We had support from
80 percent of Brazilians,

00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:20.335
and thought that this could help us
win the referendum

00:06:20.335 --> 00:06:22.747
to ban gun sales to civilians.

00:06:22.747 --> 00:06:25.928
But we were dead wrong.

00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:29.249
During a televised 20-day public debate,

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:33.103
our opponent used
our own arguments against us.

00:06:33.103 --> 00:06:35.332
We ended up losing the popular vote.

00:06:35.332 --> 00:06:37.677
It was really terrible.

00:06:37.677 --> 00:06:43.836
The National Rifle Association --
yes, the American NRA --

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:45.595
came to Brazil.

00:06:45.595 --> 00:06:48.695
They inundated our campaign
with their propaganda,

00:06:48.695 --> 00:06:50.238
that as you know,

00:06:50.238 --> 00:06:54.581
links the right to own guns
to ideas of freedom and democracy.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.458
They simply threw everything at us.

00:06:58.458 --> 00:07:00.385
They used our national flag,

00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:02.080
our independence anthem.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.915
They invoked women's rights

00:07:03.915 --> 00:07:09.302
and misused images of Mandela,
Tiananmen Square, and even Hitler.

00:07:09.302 --> 00:07:13.272
They won by playing with people's fears.

00:07:13.272 --> 00:07:17.916
In fact, guns were almost completely
ignored in their campaign.

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:21.213
Their focus was on individual rights.

00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:22.792
But I ask you,

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:25.021
which right is more important,

00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:26.832
the right to life

00:07:26.832 --> 00:07:29.897
or the right to have a gun
that takes life away?

00:07:29.897 --> 00:07:34.150
(Applause)

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.972
We thought people would vote
in defense of life,

00:07:37.972 --> 00:07:42.756
but in a country with a recent past
of military dictatorship,

00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:47.027
the anti-government message
of our opponents resonated,

00:07:47.027 --> 00:07:50.626
and we were not prepared to respond.

00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:52.715
Lesson learned.

00:07:52.715 --> 00:07:56.005
We've been more successful
in the case of drug policy.

00:07:56.005 --> 00:08:00.719
If you asked most people 10 years ago if
an end to the War on Drugs was possible,

00:08:00.719 --> 00:08:02.731
they would have laughed.

00:08:02.731 --> 00:08:06.229
After all, there are huge
military police prisons

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:10.325
and financial establishments
benefiting from this war.

00:08:10.325 --> 00:08:16.097
But today, the international drug
control regime is starting to crumble.

00:08:16.097 --> 00:08:20.926
Governments and civil societies
are experimenting with new approaches.

00:08:20.926 --> 00:08:23.248
The Global Commission on Drug Policy

00:08:23.248 --> 00:08:25.315
really knew its opposition,

00:08:25.315 --> 00:08:27.149
and rather than fighting them,

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:31.793
our chair -- former Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso --

00:08:31.793 --> 00:08:36.065
reached out to leaders
from across the political spectrum,

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:38.875
from liberals to conservatives.

00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:43.751
This high level group
agreed to honestly discuss

00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:45.701
the merits and flaws of drug policies.

00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:50.461
It was this reasoned, informed
and strategic discussion

00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:54.222
that revealed the sad truth
about the War on Drugs.

00:08:54.222 --> 00:09:00.538
The War on Drugs has simply failed
across every metric.

00:09:00.538 --> 00:09:03.440
Drugs are cheaper
and more available than ever,

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.227
and consumption has risen globally.

00:09:06.227 --> 00:09:08.409
But even worse,

00:09:08.409 --> 00:09:14.980
it also generated massive
negative unintended consequences.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.626
It is true that some people
have made these arguments before,

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:20.366
but we've made a difference

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:23.378
by anticipating the arguments
of our opponents

00:09:23.378 --> 00:09:25.484
and by leveraging powerful voices

00:09:25.484 --> 00:09:30.374
that a few years ago
would probably have resisted change.

00:09:30.374 --> 00:09:34.461
Third lesson: Use data
to drive your argument.

00:09:34.461 --> 00:09:37.456
Guns and drugs are emotive issues,

00:09:37.456 --> 00:09:41.357
and as we've painfully learned
in the gun referendum campaign in Brazil,

00:09:41.357 --> 00:09:44.422
sometimes it's impossible
to cut through the emotions

00:09:44.422 --> 00:09:46.512
and get to the facts.

00:09:46.512 --> 00:09:49.600
But this doesn't mean
that we shouldn't try.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.251
Until quite recently,

00:09:51.251 --> 00:09:55.265
we simply didn't know
how many Brazilians were killed by guns.

00:09:55.265 --> 00:10:00.780
Amazingly, it was a local soap opera
called "Mulheres Apaixonadas" --

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.498
or "Women in Love" --

00:10:02.498 --> 00:10:06.410
that kicked off Brazil's
national gun control campaign.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.872
In one highly viewed episode,

00:10:08.872 --> 00:10:13.074
a soap opera lead actress
was killed by a stray bullet.

00:10:13.074 --> 00:10:17.370
Brazilian grannies
and housewives were outraged,

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.644
and in a case of art imitating life,

00:10:20.644 --> 00:10:25.938
this episode also included footage
of a real gun control march

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:28.422
that we had organized right here,


00:10:28.422 --> 00:10:31.255
outside in Copacabana Beach.

00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:36.699
The televised death and march
had a huge impact on public opinion.

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:41.483
Within weeks, our national congress
approved the disarmament bill

00:10:41.483 --> 00:10:44.571
that had been languishing for years.

00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:47.586
We were then able to mobilize data

00:10:47.586 --> 00:10:50.886
to show the successful outcomes
of the change in the law

00:10:50.886 --> 00:10:53.007
and gun collection program.

00:10:53.007 --> 00:10:54.769
Here is what I mean:

00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:58.293
We could prove that in just one year,

00:10:58.293 --> 00:11:03.099
we saved more than 5,000 lives.

00:11:03.099 --> 00:11:06.862
(Applause)

00:11:06.862 --> 00:11:09.276
And in the case of drugs,

00:11:09.276 --> 00:11:14.570
in order to undermine this fear
and prejudice that surrounds the issue,

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.678
we managed to gather and present data
that shows that today's drug policies

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:23.549
cause much more harm than drug use per se,

00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:27.682
and people are starting to get it.

00:11:27.682 --> 00:11:29.818
My fourth insight is:

00:11:29.818 --> 00:11:34.044
Don't be afraid to bring
together odd bedfellows.

00:11:34.044 --> 00:11:36.018
What we've learned in Brazil --

00:11:36.018 --> 00:11:38.363
and this doesn't only
apply to my country --

00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:42.995
is the importance of bringing diverse
and eclectic folks together.

00:11:42.995 --> 00:11:45.131
If you want to change the world,

00:11:45.131 --> 00:11:49.427
it helps to have a good cross-section
of society on your side.

00:11:49.427 --> 00:11:52.027
In both the case of guns and drugs,

00:11:52.027 --> 00:11:55.463
we brought together
a wonderful mix of people.

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:59.667
We mobilized the elite
and got huge support from the media.

00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:04.124
We gathered the victims,
human rights champions, cultural icons.

00:12:04.124 --> 00:12:06.701
We also assembled
the professional classes --

00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:09.697
doctors, lawyers, academia and more.

00:12:09.697 --> 00:12:12.437
What I've learned over the last years

00:12:12.437 --> 00:12:18.337
is that you need coalitions of the willing
and of the unwilling to make change.

00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:20.204
In the case of drugs,

00:12:20.204 --> 00:12:23.791
we needed libertarians,
anti-prohibitionists, legalizers,

00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:26.136
and liberal politicians.

00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:28.597
They may not agree on everything;

00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:32.846
in fact, they disagree
on almost everything.

00:12:32.846 --> 00:12:38.615
But the legitimacy of the campaign
is based on their diverse points of view.

00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:41.762
Over a decade ago,

00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:46.220
I had a comfortable future
working for an investment bank.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.492
I was as far removed from the world
of civil society diplomacy

00:12:50.492 --> 00:12:52.768
as you can imagine.

00:12:52.768 --> 00:12:54.927
But I took a chance.

00:12:54.927 --> 00:12:56.924
I changed course,

00:12:56.924 --> 00:13:00.284
and on the way, I helped 
to create social movements

00:13:00.284 --> 00:13:05.004
that I believe have made 
some parts of the world safer.

00:13:05.004 --> 00:13:10.178
Each and every one of us
has the power to change the world.

00:13:10.178 --> 00:13:14.790
No matter what the issue,
and no matter how hard the fight,

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.504
civil society is central
to the blueprint for change.

00:13:19.504 --> 00:13:21.815
Thank you.

00:13:21.815 --> 00:13:25.832
(Applause)
