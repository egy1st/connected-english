00:00:00.918 --> 00:00:02.778
As an African woman,

00:00:02.778 --> 00:00:04.780
I often find that my life

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.816
is about confronting

00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:11.501
a single story of some form or other.

00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:14.326
So when TED asked me to come and speak

00:00:14.326 --> 00:00:17.757
about feeding a lot of people,

00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:19.871
the one thing I was sure about

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:22.616
was that I was not going to rehash

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:25.991
stories of poverty, misery

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.850
or hunger in Africa.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.130
But the more I thought about it,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.549
the more I realized that it would be like

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:36.339
walking in here and finding an elephant

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.916
and not acknowledging it.

00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:42.257
In some cultures, that might even be rude.

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:45.282
So, I'd like to start

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:47.839
by sharing an image

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.179
that might be familiar to many of you.

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.830
That is a BBC picture of Michael Buerk

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.390
reporting from Ethiopia

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.171
on the 1984 famine

00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:03.930
which shook the conscience of the world,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.210
even in Africa.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.658
That BBC broadcast

00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:12.130
brought into our living rooms

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.176
the face and the scale

00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:19.192
of human catastrophe in Africa,

00:01:19.192 --> 00:01:23.427
and even though it was 
taken exactly 30 years ago

00:01:23.427 --> 00:01:25.073
this month,

00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:29.197
it is still the way many 
people view Africa,

00:01:29.197 --> 00:01:31.380
as a continent that's desperate,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.994
that's helpless, that's hungry.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.733
This is a less familiar picture,

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:43.558
but it is a picture of a 
typical Ghanaian farmer.

00:01:43.558 --> 00:01:45.379
She said to say hello.

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:47.580
And next to her is a box

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.338
of delightful Belgian chocolates.

00:01:52.338 --> 00:01:56.281
To me, even though this picture is more recent,

00:01:56.281 --> 00:02:01.573
it is also a more enduring picture.

00:02:01.573 --> 00:02:03.560
It could easily be 20,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.021
30 or even 50 years old.

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:10.183
It is the picture of the lopsided terms of trade

00:02:10.183 --> 00:02:12.701
in agriculture.

00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:14.210
It is also the picture

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:21.805
of untapped potential and 
unequal opportunity all at once.

00:02:21.812 --> 00:02:25.536
Now, if my American nieces 
and nephews were here,

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:27.711
they would say, "Auntie Sipho,

00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:31.544
what does the farmer have to
do with a box of chocolates?"

00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:34.164
Because, like most people's 
nieces and nephews,

00:02:34.164 --> 00:02:37.723
they think chicken comes 
from the supermarket,

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:41.839
chocolate comes from a box.

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:44.101
But the reality is that

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:46.294
that box of chocolates

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:49.647
could not exist without the farmer,

00:02:49.647 --> 00:02:52.571
and yet the farmer continues to take home

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:57.190
literally a raw deal every day.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.964
So, why don't I put that into perspective?

00:03:01.964 --> 00:03:04.674
Today, the chocolate industry

00:03:04.674 --> 00:03:10.057
is valued at 110 billion dollars —

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:12.889
and remember, they get 70 percent

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.457
of their cocoa from West Africa.

00:03:17.457 --> 00:03:20.798
But yet, while the chocolate industry

00:03:20.798 --> 00:03:24.678
is in the parlor counting all its billions,

00:03:24.678 --> 00:03:27.248
the farmers downstream in the value chain

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:29.101
are in the garden

00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:32.846
struggling to feed their families.

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:35.940
So this, you are thinking,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.559
must be the story of cocoa 
farmers in West Africa.

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:45.674
Well, it's not just the story of 
cocoa farmers in West Africa.

00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:47.398
This is the story

00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:51.425
of all kinds of farmers all across Africa,

00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:53.628
breaking their backs

00:03:53.628 --> 00:03:58.100
and getting the short end 
of the value chain stick,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.143
and as far as I'm concerned,

00:04:01.143 --> 00:04:04.776
the main cause of that is policy failure,

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:08.240
policy failures that affect everything

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.150
from productivity to infrastructure

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.051
to the terms of trade.

00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:20.708
This is a placeholder for a picture 
that hasn't yet been taken,

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:23.415
so just help me to 
imagine a future picture,

00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:26.227
a picture that will be taken 
maybe 30 years from now,

00:04:26.227 --> 00:04:28.671
a picture of a thriving Africa,

00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:31.843
an Africa that's not just feeding itself,

00:04:31.843 --> 00:04:33.376
but an Africa that's helping

00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:36.976
to feed the world,

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:40.238
driven by its agriculture productivity,

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:43.545
by its agriculture transformation.

00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:45.618
Specifically, think about an Africa

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.251
that's able to feed the world.

00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:52.198
This is an exciting picture for me,

00:04:52.198 --> 00:04:54.405
and the reason this picture is exciting

00:04:54.405 --> 00:04:56.283
is because it is possible.

00:04:56.283 --> 00:04:59.010
I just talked about the policy failures

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.625
that need to be addressed,

00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:01.975
but I would like you to hold

00:05:01.975 --> 00:05:05.530
that positive image of an 
Africa feeding the world,

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.139
because today

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.312
there are seven billion 
people on the planet.

00:05:11.312 --> 00:05:13.112
We've heard throughout this week

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:18.110
that by 2050 there 
will be 10 billion of us,

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.402
10 billion people on the planet.

00:05:21.402 --> 00:05:25.215
That has implications 
for dinnertime, surely.

00:05:25.215 --> 00:05:27.521
So the question is,

00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:32.561
how are we going to 
feed 10 billion mouths?

00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:35.466
From everything we know,

00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:38.594
there is no answer to that question

00:05:38.594 --> 00:05:41.797
that does not involve Africa.

00:05:41.797 --> 00:05:44.431
Let me explain.

00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:46.045
We're going to need land,

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:47.994
we're going to need water

00:05:47.994 --> 00:05:50.755
and we're going to need people.

00:05:50.755 --> 00:05:52.416
Here are the facts:

00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:56.199
60 percent of the world's 
remaining arable land

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.136
is in Africa;

00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:02.154
Africa's water resources

00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:06.190
are the least tapped in the whole world;

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.311
and Africa, already the 
youngest continent,

00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:11.831
will soon have the largest

00:06:11.831 --> 00:06:15.711
and the youngest workforce.

00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:18.917
So you see where I'm going with this.

00:06:18.917 --> 00:06:22.420
And even before we get 
to the uncultivated land,

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.125
there is so much potential

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:26.308
to get much more from the land

00:06:26.308 --> 00:06:29.469
that is already under cultivation.

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:32.046
So what's the holdup, you might be asking.

00:06:32.046 --> 00:06:34.468
Let me paint a picture for you

00:06:34.468 --> 00:06:37.106
of how African farmers

00:06:37.106 --> 00:06:40.144
have to work and produce food

00:06:40.144 --> 00:06:43.942
and feed those of us on the continent.

00:06:43.942 --> 00:06:47.419
They're working with an incredible combination

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:51.704
of little to no fertilizer,

00:06:51.704 --> 00:06:54.393
tired seeds,

00:06:54.393 --> 00:06:59.039
and — get this — prebiblical tools.

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.727
Not biblical tools.

00:07:01.727 --> 00:07:04.168
You all remember that in biblical times,

00:07:04.168 --> 00:07:05.968
almost everyone had

00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:08.217
at least half a dozen yoke of oxen

00:07:08.217 --> 00:07:10.805
drawing their plows.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.482
African farmers, no, they don't have that.

00:07:13.482 --> 00:07:18.324
They work with hoes, picks and cutlasses,

00:07:18.324 --> 00:07:22.335
and these tools predate biblical times.

00:07:22.335 --> 00:07:25.135
So that's a picture that's 
going to have to change.

00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:27.216
What is amazing is that they're able

00:07:27.216 --> 00:07:29.556
to produce anything at all,

00:07:29.556 --> 00:07:31.534
much less the 80 percent of the food

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:36.305
that is consumed on the African continent.

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:41.169
Imagine if African farmers did not 
have to deal with unfriendly policies.

00:07:41.178 --> 00:07:43.304
Imagine if they didn't have to worry

00:07:43.304 --> 00:07:45.528
about unaffordable credit,

00:07:45.528 --> 00:07:48.140
if they didn't have to 
worry about the threat

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.207
of climate change,

00:07:50.207 --> 00:07:53.980
degraded soils,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.148
bad roads in the rainy season

00:07:57.148 --> 00:07:59.399
that turn to mud so that their produce

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:00.949
is waiting at the roadside

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:05.070
spoiling while waiting to get to market.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.616
But this is exactly what 
African farmers have to do,

00:08:08.616 --> 00:08:11.707
and in order to feed

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:14.612
the 10 billion people that 
I talked about in 2050,

00:08:14.612 --> 00:08:18.281
that's a picture that will have to change.

00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:20.038
There is a long way to go

00:08:20.038 --> 00:08:23.601
and the challenges are 
definitely enormous,

00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:25.985
but for every challenge,

00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:29.239
there's an even greater opportunity,

00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:32.746
and that's what I'd 
like to talk about now.

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:34.970
How is Africa going to go

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.997
from meeting its needs

00:08:36.997 --> 00:08:39.866
to creating wealth?

00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:42.698
So essentially, for Africa to 
go from meeting its needs

00:08:42.698 --> 00:08:44.198
to creating its wealth,

00:08:44.198 --> 00:08:47.299
I think we need to change the model.

00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:49.628
We need to change how we do agriculture.

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:51.753
So I think it's clear by now

00:08:51.753 --> 00:08:55.544
that I'm not just talking 
about subsistence farming.

00:08:55.544 --> 00:09:02.230
I am talking about farming with 
a large scale or a small scale,

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.970
but farming as an enterprise.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.853
I am also talking about agribusiness.

00:09:09.853 --> 00:09:11.968
Okay, I see the investors in the room,

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:14.933
they are starting to lean forward.

00:09:14.933 --> 00:09:19.910
So let's take a success story: Brazil.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.351
It took Brazil just about 30 years

00:09:23.351 --> 00:09:28.762
to transform itself 
from a net food importer

00:09:28.762 --> 00:09:33.318
to the world's top exporter

00:09:33.318 --> 00:09:38.788
of beef, of poultry, tropical fruits,

00:09:38.788 --> 00:09:41.824
sugar cane, you name it.

00:09:41.824 --> 00:09:43.159
All over the world,

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:45.260
people see stickers on their food

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.763
that say "Grown in Brazil."

00:09:48.763 --> 00:09:51.157
And even in Africa, where I come from,

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:53.373
if there's a chicken at the dinner table,

00:09:53.373 --> 00:09:57.794
chances are it's a Brazilian chicken.

00:09:57.794 --> 00:09:59.920
So imagine a few years from now,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.820
walking into your local grocery store

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.940
and picking up a bag of potatoes

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.970
that says "Grown in Nigeria,"

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.516
or buying that fine box of chocolates

00:10:10.516 --> 00:10:15.202
from a Ghanaian chocolatier.

00:10:15.202 --> 00:10:17.975
That's the image that we need to see,

00:10:17.975 --> 00:10:21.698
and that picture is not too far away.

00:10:21.698 --> 00:10:24.614
And if you don't believe me, 
talk to the economists

00:10:24.614 --> 00:10:27.311
over at the African Development Bank.

00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:29.831
They say by 2030,

00:10:29.831 --> 00:10:32.215
Africa's food market will be worth

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:36.648
one trillion dollars.

00:10:36.648 --> 00:10:39.438
But, there's a catch to that:

00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:44.344
if and only if the policies are right.

00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:46.932
That means the farmers have access

00:10:46.932 --> 00:10:49.923
to affordable credit,

00:10:49.923 --> 00:10:51.940
if the infrastructure is in place —

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.293
that means the roads,

00:10:53.293 --> 00:10:54.988
the railways, the electricity,

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.854
the irrigation, the technology,

00:10:57.854 --> 00:11:01.051
and that means we break 
down the trade barriers

00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:05.278
and improve the terms of trade.

00:11:05.278 --> 00:11:08.653
Essentially, all of these 
policy interventions

00:11:08.653 --> 00:11:12.906
should seek to attract 
private sector investors

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:15.110
in agriculture.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.910
That's how we're going to help

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:23.974
to feed the 10 billion people 
on the planet by 2050.

00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:27.639
So, for all of this to happen,

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:30.937
it is important that the policies are right.

00:11:30.937 --> 00:11:35.673
It is important that we change the way we see,

00:11:35.673 --> 00:11:39.137
support, and manage agriculture,

00:11:39.137 --> 00:11:41.702
and if all of those things happen,

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:44.166
it is not a stretch, again,

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:46.404
to imagine Brazilian chickens

00:11:46.404 --> 00:11:51.572
being replaced by Malawian chickens.

00:11:51.572 --> 00:11:55.850
The reality is that if governments 
keep their promises,

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.104
put more budget into agriculture,

00:11:59.104 --> 00:12:03.858
help the farmers who 
already feed us to thrive,

00:12:03.858 --> 00:12:07.594
that is what will change 
the image of agriculture

00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:10.000
and help Africa to feed the world.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.902
I think for young people who
are thinking about a career,

00:12:12.902 --> 00:12:15.827
who are thinking about 
business opportunities,

00:12:15.827 --> 00:12:19.320
it is important for them, and for us,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.226
to begin to see agriculture

00:12:21.226 --> 00:12:25.141
the same way that Godiva and Nestle

00:12:25.141 --> 00:12:26.896
see the chocolate industry:

00:12:26.896 --> 00:12:29.134
as a profitable sector.

00:12:29.134 --> 00:12:33.319
The way that investors, 
like Aliko Dangote —

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:36.289
he's only the richest 
black person in the world.

00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:41.557
It had actually never occurred to me that 
anyone was richer than Oprah, but —

00:12:41.557 --> 00:12:43.984
(Laughter) (Applause) —

00:12:43.984 --> 00:12:47.954
He has just bet his wealth on agriculture.

00:12:47.954 --> 00:12:51.350
He's recently announced 
a $1 billion investment

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.985
into Nigerian commercial rice farming.

00:12:55.985 --> 00:12:58.898
So that's how we need to 
see agriculture in Africa.

00:12:58.898 --> 00:13:03.504
In fact, for Dangote, 
agriculture is no different

00:13:03.504 --> 00:13:08.040
than oil is for ExxonMobil.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.542
That's how much value 
he sees in agriculture,

00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:14.271
and that's the image 
that we need to project

00:13:14.271 --> 00:13:16.594
to the investors, to the young people,

00:13:16.594 --> 00:13:21.180
because that is the future of agriculture.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.982
I would like to just end

00:13:22.982 --> 00:13:24.883
with a personal story,

00:13:24.883 --> 00:13:27.988
because I think it is clear that Africa

00:13:27.988 --> 00:13:31.255
has an opportunity, given 
everything we know,

00:13:31.255 --> 00:13:35.592
to not only transform as a continent,

00:13:35.592 --> 00:13:38.528
but it has an opportunity 
to help feed the world,

00:13:38.528 --> 00:13:41.869
and, more importantly, 
to change the picture

00:13:41.869 --> 00:13:44.298
forever and for good.

00:13:44.298 --> 00:13:45.660
On a personal note,

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.561
I grew up in Zambia,

00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:49.792
where my family was 
exiled during the struggle

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:52.453
for the liberation of Zimbabwe.

00:13:52.453 --> 00:13:55.500
Both my parents had grown up on the land,

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.931
and they were lucky enough to have parents

00:13:57.931 --> 00:14:00.410
who invested in their education

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.533
so that they could escape the rural areas.

00:14:03.533 --> 00:14:06.003
And all they wanted for 
us, as their children,

00:14:06.003 --> 00:14:07.420
was a better life.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.148
They knew the life of a farmer.

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:10.892
They knew what it meant

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:14.737
to live one crop failure 
away from a disaster,

00:14:14.737 --> 00:14:17.886
and for me, they wanted me to be a doctor,

00:14:17.886 --> 00:14:20.383
maybe a lawyer or an engineer,

00:14:20.383 --> 00:14:24.219
anything but a farmer.

00:14:24.219 --> 00:14:26.795
So it must have been some relief for them

00:14:26.795 --> 00:14:28.742
when I went off to university.

00:14:28.742 --> 00:14:30.912
Even though I went and studied something

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:33.320
as dismal as economics,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.579
at least it wasn't farming.

00:14:36.579 --> 00:14:38.222
But the real surprise

00:14:38.222 --> 00:14:42.486
was when my life went full circle,

00:14:42.486 --> 00:14:44.904
and I literally came back to my roots

00:14:44.904 --> 00:14:47.592
and used my education as an economist

00:14:47.592 --> 00:14:51.968
to advocate for agriculture.

00:14:51.968 --> 00:14:54.930
Because for me, I see it very differently.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.970
Agriculture is not a dead end.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.345
That sector that they 
prayed I would escape,

00:15:01.345 --> 00:15:03.599
that's the sector I'm 
working hard for now,

00:15:03.599 --> 00:15:05.454
because I see agriculture

00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:08.639
not only as the future of Africa,

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:11.260
but it is the future of all of us.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.680
Thank you.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.818
(Applause)
