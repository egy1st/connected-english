00:00:00.813 --> 00:00:03.641
So, I thought a lot about
the first word I'd say today,

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:06.155
and I decided to say "Colombia."

00:00:06.155 --> 00:00:10.214
And the reason, I don't know
how many of you have visited Colombia,

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:13.064
but Colombia is just north
of the border with Brazil.

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:14.271
It's a beautiful country

00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:17.727
with extraordinary people,
like me and others -- (Laughter) --

00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:23.157
and it's populated
with incredible fauna, flora.

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:27.324
It's got water; it's got everything
to be the perfect place.

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:29.052
But we have a few problems.

00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:30.722
You may have heard of some of them.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:34.415
We have the oldest
standing guerrilla in the world.

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:36.414
It's been around for over 50 years,

00:00:36.414 --> 00:00:39.177
which means that in my lifetime,

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:43.852
I have never lived one day 
of peace in my country.

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:47.725
This guerrilla -- and the main group
is the FARC guerrillas,

00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:50.142
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia --

00:00:50.142 --> 00:00:57.631
they have financed their war
by kidnapping, by extortion,

00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:01.480
by getting into the drug trade,
by illegal mining.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.301
There has been terrorism.
There have been random bombs.

00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:09.576
So it's not good.
It's not really good.

00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:14.376
And if you look at the human cost
of this war over 50 years,

00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:19.197
we have had more than
5.7 million displaced population.

00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:22.265
It's one of the biggest displaced
populations in the world,

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:26.374
and this conflict has cost
over 220,000 lives.

00:01:26.374 --> 00:01:29.432
So it's a little bit like
the BolÃ­var wars again.

00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:32.587
It's a lot of people who
have died unnecessarily.

00:01:32.587 --> 00:01:35.665
We are now in the middle of peace talks,

00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:38.958
and we've been trying to help
resolve this problem peacefully,

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.518
and as part of that,

00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:44.427
we decided to try something
completely lateral and different:

00:01:44.427 --> 00:01:46.471
Christmas lights.

00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:48.977
So Christmas lights, and you're saying,

00:01:48.977 --> 00:01:51.893
what the hell is this guy
going to talk about?

00:01:52.173 --> 00:01:56.785
I am going to talk about gigantic trees

00:01:56.785 --> 00:02:02.412
that we put in nine strategic 
pathways in the jungle

00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:04.421
covered with Christmas lights.

00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:10.599
These trees helped us 
demobilize 331 guerrillas,

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.097
roughly five percent
of the guerrilla force at the time.

00:02:15.097 --> 00:02:17.675
These trees were lit up at night,

00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:20.044
and they had a sign beside them

00:02:20.044 --> 00:02:24.735
that said, "If Christmas can come
to the jungle, you can come home.

00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:26.435
Demobilize.

00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:28.916
At Christmas, everything is possible."

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:32.209
So how do we know these trees worked?

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.215
Well, we got 331, which is okay,

00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:39.480
but we also know that
not a lot of guerrillas saw them,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.984
but we know that a lot of
guerrillas heard about them,

00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:43.191
and we know this

00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:46.295
because we are constantly talking
to demobilized guerrillas.

00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:49.050
So let me take you back
four years before the trees.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.735
Four years before the trees,
we were approached by the government

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:56.882
to help them come up with
a communications strategy

00:02:56.882 --> 00:03:00.082
to get as many guerrillas
as we could out of the jungle.

00:03:00.082 --> 00:03:02.534
The government had a military strategy,

00:03:02.534 --> 00:03:03.862
it had a legal strategy,

00:03:03.862 --> 00:03:06.691
it had a political strategy, but it said,

00:03:06.691 --> 00:03:09.036
"We don't really have
a communications strategy,

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:11.987
and it probably would be
a good thing to have,"

00:03:11.987 --> 00:03:16.373
so we decided to
immediately jump into this,

00:03:16.373 --> 00:03:21.588
because it is an opportunity
to affect the outcome of the conflict

00:03:21.588 --> 00:03:25.684
with the things that we do,
with the tools that we have.

00:03:26.264 --> 00:03:28.493
But we didn't know very much about it.

00:03:28.493 --> 00:03:31.709
We didn't understand in Colombia, 
if you live in the cities,

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.803
you're very far away from where 
the war is actually happening,

00:03:34.803 --> 00:03:36.816
so you don't really understand it,

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:38.982
and we asked the government 
to give us access

00:03:38.982 --> 00:03:41.524
to as many demobilized
guerrillas as possible.

00:03:41.524 --> 00:03:43.980
And we talked to about 60 of them

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.074
before we felt we fully
understood the problem.

00:03:49.074 --> 00:03:52.386
We talked about -- they told us why 
they had joined the guerrillas,

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:55.025
why the left the guerrillas,
what their dreams were,

00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:56.713
what their frustrations were,

00:03:56.713 --> 00:04:01.173
and from those conversations
came the underlying insight

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:03.670
that has guided this whole campaign,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.060
which is that guerrillas are as much
prisoners of their organizations

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.533
as the people they hold hostage.

00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:14.313
And at the beginning, we were
so touched by these stories,

00:04:14.313 --> 00:04:16.596
we were so amazed by these stories,

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:19.735
that we thought that maybe 
the best way to talk to the guerrillas

00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:22.570
was to have them talk to themselves,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.354
so we recorded about a hundred
different stories during the first year,

00:04:27.354 --> 00:04:29.722
and we put them on
the radio and television

00:04:29.722 --> 00:04:34.067
so that the guerrillas in the jungle
could hear stories, their stories,

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:36.415
or stories similar to theirs,

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:39.195
and when they heard them,
they decided to go out.

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:41.789
I want to tell you one of these stories.

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.443
This person you see here 
is Giovanni Andres.

00:04:44.443 --> 00:04:47.274
Giovanni Andres is 25
when we took that picture.

00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:51.963
He had been seven years in the guerrilla,
and he had demobilized very recently.

00:04:51.963 --> 00:04:54.528
His story is the following:

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:57.724
He was recruited when he was 17,

00:04:57.724 --> 00:05:02.909
and sometime later,
in his squadron, if you will,

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:08.085
this beautiful girl was recruited,
and they fell in love.

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:11.956
Their conversations were about
what their family was going to be like,

00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:14.288
what their kids' names would be,

00:05:14.288 --> 00:05:16.885
how their life would be
when they left the guerrilla.

00:05:16.885 --> 00:05:18.342
But it turns out

00:05:18.342 --> 00:05:21.935
that love is very strictly forbidden
in the lower ranks of the guerrilla,

00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:25.298
so their romance was discovered
and they were separated.

00:05:25.298 --> 00:05:28.711
He was sent very far away,
and she was left behind.

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:31.368
She was very familiar with the territory,

00:05:31.368 --> 00:05:33.949
so one night, when she was on guard,

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.650
she just left,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.112
and she went to the army, she demobilized,

00:05:39.112 --> 00:05:42.996
and she was one of the persons
that we had the fortune to talk to,

00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:45.346
and we were really touched by this story,

00:05:45.346 --> 00:05:47.714
so we made a radio spot,

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:50.640
and it turns out, by chance,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.123
that far away, many, 
many kilometers north,

00:05:54.123 --> 00:05:57.281
he heard her on the radio,

00:05:57.281 --> 00:06:01.851
and when he heard her on the radio,
he said, "What am I doing here?

00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:07.293
She had the balls to get out.
I need to do the same thing."

00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:08.691
And he did.

00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:11.589
He walked for two days and two nights,

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.952
and he risked his life and he got out,

00:06:13.952 --> 00:06:16.913
and the only thing
he wanted was to see her.

00:06:16.913 --> 00:06:20.439
The only thing that was
in his mind was to see her.

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:23.356
The story was, they did meet.

00:06:23.356 --> 00:06:25.887
I know you're wondering if they did meet.

00:06:25.887 --> 00:06:27.136
They did meet.

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:31.139
She had been recruited when she was 15,
and she left when she was 17,

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.199
so there were a lot
of other complications,

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.931
but they did eventually meet.

00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:40.206
I don't know if they're together now,
but I can find out. (Laughter)

00:06:40.206 --> 00:06:48.177
But what I can tell you is that
our radio strategy was working.

00:06:48.177 --> 00:06:51.861
The problem is that it was working
in the lower ranks of the guerrilla.

00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:54.224
It was not working with the commanders,

00:06:54.224 --> 00:06:56.435
the people that are
more difficult to replace,

00:06:56.435 --> 00:07:02.013
because you can easily recruit
but you can't get the older commanders.

00:07:02.013 --> 00:07:05.696
So we thought, well,
we'll use the same strategy.

00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:08.262
We'll have commanders
talking to commanders.

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:12.038
And we even went as far
as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla

00:07:12.038 --> 00:07:14.773
to fly on helicopters with microphones

00:07:14.773 --> 00:07:18.234
telling the people that
used to fight with them,

00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:20.347
"There is a better life out there,"

00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:22.924
"I'm doing good,"
"This is not worth it," etc.

00:07:22.924 --> 00:07:28.030
But, as you can all imagine,
it was very easy to counteract,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.583
because what was
the guerrilla going to say?

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:33.791
"Yeah, right, if he doesn't do that,
he's going to get killed."

00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:37.856
So it was easy, so we were
suddenly left with nothing,

00:07:37.856 --> 00:07:40.135
because the guerrilla
were spreading the word

00:07:40.135 --> 00:07:42.846
that all of those things are done

00:07:42.846 --> 00:07:48.348
because if they don't do it, 
they're in danger.

00:07:48.348 --> 00:07:51.512
And somebody, some
brilliant person in our team,

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:55.150
came back and said,
"You know what I noticed?

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.707
I noticed that around Christmastime,

00:07:58.707 --> 00:08:01.398
there have been peaks of demobilization

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:04.393
since this war has started."

00:08:04.393 --> 00:08:07.000
And that was incredible,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.481
because that led us to think 
that we needed to talk to the human being

00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:14.052
and not to the soldier.

00:08:14.052 --> 00:08:16.189
We needed to step away from talking

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:21.459
from government to army,
from army to army,

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.756
and we needed to talk
about the universal values,

00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:27.218
and we needed to talk about humanity.

00:08:27.218 --> 00:08:30.592
And that was when
the Christmas tree happened.

00:08:30.592 --> 00:08:32.599
This picture that I have here,

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:35.791
you see this is the planning
of the Christmas trees,

00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:39.540
and that man you see there
with the three stars,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.669
he's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:46.640
Captain Valdez was the first 
high-ranking official

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.503
to give us the helicopters 
and the support we needed

00:08:50.503 --> 00:08:52.853
to put these Christmas trees up,

00:08:52.853 --> 00:08:56.145
and he said in that meeting
something that I will never forget.

00:08:56.145 --> 00:09:03.339
He said, "I want to do this
because being generous makes me stronger,

00:09:03.339 --> 00:09:05.691
makes my men feel stronger."

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:08.431
And I get very emotional
when I remember him

00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:12.816
because he was killed later in combat
and we really miss him,

00:09:12.816 --> 00:09:19.092
but I wanted you all to see him,
because he was really, really important.

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:23.220
He gave us all the support
to put up the first Christmas trees.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.953
What happened later is that
the guerrillas who came out

00:09:25.953 --> 00:09:29.573
during the Christmas tree 
operation and all of that

00:09:29.573 --> 00:09:33.369
said, "That's really good,
Christmas trees are really cool,

00:09:33.369 --> 00:09:35.899
but you know what?
We really don't walk anymore.

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:37.351
We use rivers."

00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:40.738
So rivers are the highways of the jungle,

00:09:40.738 --> 00:09:42.935
and this is something we learned,

00:09:42.935 --> 00:09:48.237
and most of the recruiting was being done
in and around the river villages.

00:09:48.237 --> 00:09:50.520
So we went to these river villages,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.421
and we asked the people,

00:09:52.421 --> 00:09:55.775
and probably some of them were
direct acquaintances of the guerrillas.

00:09:55.775 --> 00:09:59.769
We asked them, "Can you send
guerrillas a message?"

00:09:59.769 --> 00:10:03.159
We collected over 6,000 messages.

00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:05.805
Some of them were notes saying, get out.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:08.522
Some of them were toys.
Some of them were candy.

00:10:08.522 --> 00:10:12.712
Even people took off their jewelry,
their little crosses and religious things,

00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:18.140
and put them in these floating balls
that we sent down the rivers

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.735
so that they could be picked up at night.

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:23.093
And we sent thousands
of these down the rivers,

00:10:23.093 --> 00:10:25.263
and then picked them up
later if they weren't.

00:10:25.263 --> 00:10:26.795
But lots of them were picked up.

00:10:26.795 --> 00:10:31.686
This generated, on average,
a demobilization every six hours,

00:10:31.686 --> 00:10:35.746
so this was incredible and it was about:
Come home at Christmas.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.001
Then came the peace process,

00:10:41.001 --> 00:10:43.442
and when the peace process started,

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.762
the whole mindset
of the guerrilla changed.

00:10:45.762 --> 00:10:48.087
And it changed because

00:10:48.087 --> 00:10:50.836
it makes you think, "Well,
if there's a peace process,

00:10:50.836 --> 00:10:52.778
this is probably going to be over.

00:10:52.778 --> 00:10:54.890
At some point I'm going to get out."

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.096
And their fears completely changed,

00:10:57.096 --> 00:11:00.324
and their fears were not about,
"Am I going to get killed?"

00:11:00.324 --> 00:11:03.923
Their fears were, "Am I
going to be rejected?

00:11:03.923 --> 00:11:06.732
When I get out of this,
am I going to be rejected?"

00:11:06.732 --> 00:11:09.803
So the past Christmas, 
what we did was we asked --

00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:13.550
we found 27 mothers of guerrillas,

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.784
and we asked them to give us 
pictures of their children,

00:11:17.784 --> 00:11:21.989
when they only could recognize themselves,
so as not to put their lives in danger,

00:11:21.989 --> 00:11:26.265
and we asked them to give
the most motherly message you can get,

00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:30.857
which is, "Before you were a guerrilla,
you were my child,

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.109
so come home, I'm waiting for you."

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:36.261
You can see the pictures here.
I'll show you a couple.

00:11:36.261 --> 00:11:37.605
(Applause)

00:11:37.605 --> 00:11:39.803
Thank you.

00:11:43.552 --> 00:11:48.730
And these pictures were placed
in many different places,

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.892
and a lot of them came back,

00:11:52.892 --> 00:11:55.840
and it was really, really beautiful.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.315
And then we decided to work with society.

00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:01.972
So we did mothers around Christmastime.

00:12:01.972 --> 00:12:04.826
Now let's talk about
the rest of the people.

00:12:04.826 --> 00:12:10.188
And you may be aware of this or not,
but there was a World Cup this year,

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:17.617
and Colombia played really well,
and it was a unifying moment for Colombia.

00:12:17.617 --> 00:12:21.453
And what we did was tell the guerrillas,

00:12:21.453 --> 00:12:25.510
"Come, get out of the jungle.
We're saving a place for you."

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.575
So this was television, this was 
all different types of media saying,

00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:33.037
"We are saving a place for you."

00:12:33.037 --> 00:12:36.056
The soldier here in the commercial says,

00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:38.921
"I'm saving a place for you
right here in this helicopter

00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:42.734
so that you can get out of this jungle
and go enjoy the World Cup."

00:12:42.734 --> 00:12:45.901
Ex-football players, radio announcers,

00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:48.195
everybody was saving
a place for the guerrilla.

00:12:48.195 --> 00:12:52.970
So since we started this work
a little over eight years ago,

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.397
17,000 guerrillas have demobilized.

00:12:56.397 --> 00:13:00.436
I do not -- (Applause)

00:13:00.436 --> 00:13:03.017
Thank you.

00:13:03.017 --> 00:13:11.714
I don't want to say in any way
that it only has to do with what we do,

00:13:11.714 --> 00:13:18.288
but what I do know is that our work
and the work that we do

00:13:18.288 --> 00:13:22.960
may have helped a lot of them
start thinking about demobilization,

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.968
and it may have helped a lot of them
take the final decision.

00:13:26.968 --> 00:13:33.498
If that is true, advertising is still
one of the most powerful tools of change

00:13:33.498 --> 00:13:35.740
that we have available.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.631
And I speak not only my behalf,

00:13:38.631 --> 00:13:40.975
but on behalf of all
the colleagues I see here

00:13:40.975 --> 00:13:42.639
who work in advertising,

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:46.665
and of all the team that has
worked with me to do this,

00:13:46.665 --> 00:13:49.914
that if you want to change the world,

00:13:49.914 --> 00:13:52.375
or if you want to achieve 
peace, please call us.

00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:53.875
We'd love to help.

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.238
Thank you.

00:13:55.238 --> 00:14:00.712
(Applause)
