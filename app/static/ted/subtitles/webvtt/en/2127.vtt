WEBVTT

00:00:00.907 --> 00:00:03.335
You know, it's a big privilege for me

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:07.227
to be working in one of the
biodiversity hotspots in the world:

00:00:07.227 --> 00:00:09.928
the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.

00:00:09.928 --> 00:00:13.673
These islands — Mauritius,
Rodrigues, and Réunion —

00:00:13.673 --> 00:00:16.811
along with the island of Madagascar,

00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:18.727
they are blessed with unique plants

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.840
found nowhere else in the world.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.529
And today I will tell you 
about five of them

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.524
and their particular features

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:28.408
and why these plants are so unique.

00:00:28.408 --> 00:00:29.968
Take a look at this plant.

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:33.372
I call it benjoin in the local vernacular,

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:37.298
and the botanical name 
is Terminalia bentzoe,

00:00:37.298 --> 00:00:39.199
subspecies bentzoe.

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.507
This subspecies is endemic to Mauritius,

00:00:42.507 --> 00:00:44.318
and its particular feature

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:46.792
is its heterophylly.

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:48.918
What do I mean by heterophylly?

00:00:48.918 --> 00:00:50.481
It's that the same plant

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:53.564
has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes.

00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:55.149
Now, these plants have evolved

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.503
very far away from the mainland,

00:00:57.503 --> 00:01:00.901
and within specific ecosystems.

00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:03.725
Often, these particular features

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:06.536
have evolved as a response to the threat

00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:08.973
presented by the local fauna,

00:01:08.973 --> 00:01:12.593
in this case, grazing tortoises.

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:15.749
Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight,

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:18.235
and as such, they tend to avoid the plants

00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:20.294
they don't recognize.

00:01:20.294 --> 00:01:23.668
So this evolutionary 
foil safeguards the plant

00:01:23.668 --> 00:01:26.593
against these rather cute animals,

00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:31.651
and protects it and of course 
ensures its survival.

00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:34.661
Now the question you're 
probably asking yourself is,

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.562
why is she telling us all these stories?

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:41.248
The reason for that is that we tend to overlook

00:01:41.248 --> 00:01:45.632
the diversity and the variety of the natural world.

00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:48.525
These particular habitats are unique

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:52.753
and they are host to a whole lot of plants.

00:01:52.753 --> 00:01:54.924
We don't realize how valuable

00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:57.534
and how precious these resources are,

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.729
and yet, through our insouciance,

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.898
we keep on destroying them.

00:02:01.898 --> 00:02:03.630
We're all familiar

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.825
with the macro impact of urbanization,

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:10.267
climate change, resource exploitation,

00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:12.440
but when that one last plant —

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.649
or animal for that matter —

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:16.848
when that very last specimen

00:02:16.848 --> 00:02:18.959
has disappeared from the face of this Earth,

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.355
we would have lost

00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:24.261
an entire subset of the Earth's biology,

00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:27.939
and with it, important plants 
with medicinal potential

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.874
or which could have ingredients

00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:31.395
that would speak to the cosmetic,

00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:33.316
nutrition, pharma,

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:35.735
and even the ethno-veterinary sectors,

00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:37.478
be gone forever.

00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:39.413
And here we have a very prime example

00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:42.158
of the iconic dodo, which comes from Mauritius,

00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:46.545
and, of course, we know is 
now a symbol of extinction.

00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:49.165
We know plants have a 
fundamental role to play.

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:51.000
Well, first of all, they feed us

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.890
and they also give us 
the oxygen we breathe,

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.207
but plants are also the source

00:02:56.207 --> 00:02:59.762
of important, biologically active ingredients

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:02.964
that we should be studying very carefully,

00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:07.254
because human societies over the millennia,

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:10.302
they have developed important knowledge,

00:03:10.302 --> 00:03:12.120
cultural traditions,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.416
and important plant-based medicinal resources.

00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:18.401
Here's a data point:

00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:22.563
1.4 percent of the entire land surface

00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:26.467
is home to 40 percent of
the species of higher plants,

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:29.155
35 percent of the species of vertebrates,

00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:31.698
and this 1.4 percent

00:03:31.698 --> 00:03:36.366
represents the 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world,

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:39.524
and this 1.4 percent of the entire land surface

00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:42.406
already provides for 35 percent

00:03:42.406 --> 00:03:44.240
of the ecosystem services

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.918
that vulnerable people depend on.

00:03:46.918 --> 00:03:48.266
And as you can see,

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:49.679
the island of Mauritius

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:51.762
where I work and where I live,

00:03:51.762 --> 00:03:54.467
belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot,

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.681
and I study the unique plants

00:03:56.681 --> 00:04:00.343
on the island for their 
biomedical applications.

00:04:00.343 --> 00:04:01.680
Now, let's go back again

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.520
to that first plant I showed you,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.547
the one, of course, with 
different-shaped leaves

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:09.403
and different sizes, Terminalia bentzoe,

00:04:09.403 --> 00:04:11.070
subspecies bentzoe,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.665
a plant only found in Mauritius.

00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:15.110
Now, the local people,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.336
they used a decoction of the leaves

00:04:17.336 --> 00:04:19.867
against infectious diseases.

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:22.319
Now our work, that is,

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.728
the scientific validation of 
this traditional information,

00:04:25.728 --> 00:04:27.800
has shown that precisely

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.129
that leaf extract shows activity, potent activity,

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.351
against a wide range of bacteria

00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:37.427
that could be pathogenic to humans.

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:39.868
Now, could this plant be the answer

00:04:39.868 --> 00:04:42.489
to antibiotic resistance?

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:44.840
You know, antibiotic resistance is proving to be

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.560
a big challenge globally.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.363
While we may not be sure, one thing is certain:

00:04:50.363 --> 00:04:52.972
we will not want this plant to disappear.

00:04:52.972 --> 00:04:55.616
But the harsh reality is that

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:57.600
this particular plant is in fact

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.470
considered to be vulnerable

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.630
in its natural habitat.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.778
This brings me to another example.

00:05:03.778 --> 00:05:07.568
This bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate

00:05:07.568 --> 00:05:09.290
in the local vernacular.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.945
The botanical name is Psiadia arguta.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.836
It's a plant which is rare,

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:16.548
which is endemic to Mauritius.

00:05:16.548 --> 00:05:17.770
It used to grow on the mainland,

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.213
but through the sheer 
pressures of urbanization

00:05:20.213 --> 00:05:22.492
has been pushed out of the mainland,

00:05:22.492 --> 00:05:24.193
and we've managed to bring it back

00:05:24.193 --> 00:05:25.669
from the brink of extinction

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.736
by developing in vitro plants

00:05:27.736 --> 00:05:29.584
which are now growing in the wild.

00:05:29.584 --> 00:05:31.780
Now, one thing I must 
point out straightaway

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.657
is that not all plants

00:05:34.657 --> 00:05:37.573
can be developed in vitro.

00:05:37.573 --> 00:05:41.396
While we humans, we are 
happy in our comfort zone,

00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:43.632
these plants also need

00:05:43.632 --> 00:05:46.366
their ecosystem to be preserved,

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:48.199
and they don't react — endemic plants

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.518
don't react to very harsh 
changes in their ecosystem,

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.779
and yet we know what are the challenges

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:54.867
that climate change, for example,

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:56.910
is posing to these plants.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.438
Now, the local people again use the leaves

00:05:59.438 --> 00:06:01.192
in traditional medicine

00:06:01.192 --> 00:06:03.872
against respiratory problems.

00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:05.961
Now, our preliminary labwork

00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:07.693
on the leaf extract has shown

00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:11.822
that precisely these 
leaves contain ingredients

00:06:11.822 --> 00:06:14.917
that are very close, 
in terms of structures,

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:17.283
chemical structures, to those medicines

00:06:17.283 --> 00:06:18.802
which are sold in the chemist's shop

00:06:18.802 --> 00:06:20.777
against asthma.

00:06:20.777 --> 00:06:22.687
So who knows

00:06:22.687 --> 00:06:24.773
what humanity will benefit from

00:06:24.773 --> 00:06:30.191
should this plant decide 
to reveal all its secrets.

00:06:30.191 --> 00:06:32.682
Now, I come from the developing world

00:06:32.682 --> 00:06:35.485
where we are forever being 
challenged with this issue

00:06:35.485 --> 00:06:37.879
of population explosion.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:40.693
Africa is the continent 
which is getting younger,

00:06:40.693 --> 00:06:44.396
and whenever one talks 
about population explosion,

00:06:44.396 --> 00:06:46.901
one talks about the issue of food security

00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:49.581
as being the other side of the same coin.

00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:51.899
Now this plant here, the baobab,

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.421
could be part of the answer.

00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:56.566
It's an underutilized, neglected food plant.

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:59.059
It defines the landscape of West Africa,

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:01.605
where it is known as the tree of life,

00:07:01.605 --> 00:07:04.103
and later on I will tell you why

00:07:04.103 --> 00:07:07.214
the Africans consider it to be the tree of life.

00:07:07.214 --> 00:07:09.132
Now interestingly, there are many legends

00:07:09.132 --> 00:07:11.240
which are associated with this plant.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.012
Because of its sheer size,

00:07:13.012 --> 00:07:15.914
it was meant to be lording over lesser plants,

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:17.872
so God didn't like this arrogance,

00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:20.660
uprooted it, and planted it upside down,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.182
hence its particular shape.

00:07:23.182 --> 00:07:25.690
And if you look at this tree again

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.852
within the African context,

00:07:27.852 --> 00:07:31.517
in West Africa, it's known 
as the palaver tree,

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:34.587
because it performs great social functions.

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:36.806
Now if you have a problem in the community,

00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:38.544
meeting under the palaver tree

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:40.523
with the chiefs or the tribesmen

00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:42.685
would be synonymous to trying to find a solution

00:07:42.685 --> 00:07:44.130
to that particular problem,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.070
and also to reinforce trust and respect

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.591
among members of the community.

00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:51.987
From the scientific point of view,

00:07:51.987 --> 00:07:54.682
there are eight species of baobab in the world.

00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:56.664
There's one from Africa,

00:07:56.664 --> 00:07:58.333
one from Australia,

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:01.080
and six are endemic

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.727
to the island of Madagascar.

00:08:02.727 --> 00:08:04.359
The one I have showed you

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:05.949
is the one from Africa,

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:07.870
Adansonia digitata.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.190
Now, the flower, this 
beautiful white flower,

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.314
it opens at night, is pollinated by bats,

00:08:12.314 --> 00:08:14.913
and it gives rise to the fruit

00:08:14.913 --> 00:08:16.465
which is curiously known

00:08:16.465 --> 00:08:18.200
as the monkey apple.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.693
The monkeys are not stupid animals.

00:08:19.693 --> 00:08:21.426
They know what's good for them.

00:08:21.426 --> 00:08:24.227
Now, if you open the fruit of the baobab,

00:08:24.227 --> 00:08:26.820
you'll see a white, floury pulp,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.917
which is very rich in nutrients

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:31.291
and has got protein,

00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:35.409
more protein than in human milk.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.197
Yes, you heard right:

00:08:37.197 --> 00:08:40.605
more protein than in human milk.

00:08:40.605 --> 00:08:42.495
And this is one of the reasons why

00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:44.317
the nutrition companies of this world,

00:08:44.317 --> 00:08:46.702
they are looking for this fruit to provide

00:08:46.702 --> 00:08:49.289
what we know as reinforced food.

00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:53.170
The seeds give an oil, a very stable oil

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.240
which is sought after 
by the cosmetic industry

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.502
to give to produce body lotions, for example.

00:08:59.502 --> 00:09:01.131
And if you look at the trunk,

00:09:01.131 --> 00:09:04.734
the trunk, of course, safeguards water,

00:09:04.734 --> 00:09:07.535
which is often harvested by a thirsty traveler,

00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:09.213
and the leaves are used in traditional medicine

00:09:09.213 --> 00:09:11.168
against infectious disease.

00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:13.744
Now, you can see now why the Africans consider it

00:09:13.744 --> 00:09:15.544
to be the tree of life.

00:09:15.544 --> 00:09:17.209
It's a complete plant,

00:09:17.209 --> 00:09:19.751
and in fact, the sheer size of these trees

00:09:19.751 --> 00:09:21.854
is hiding a massive potential,

00:09:21.854 --> 00:09:25.296
not only for the pharma, nutrition,
and the cosmetic industry.

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:27.302
What I have showed you here

00:09:27.302 --> 00:09:29.532
is only the species from Africa,

00:09:29.532 --> 00:09:31.416
Adansonia digitata.

00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:34.080
We have six species yet in Madagascar,

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.564
and we don't know what 
is the potential of this plant,

00:09:37.564 --> 00:09:40.030
but one thing we know is that the flora

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.592
is considered to be 
threatened with extinction.

00:09:42.592 --> 00:09:45.796
Let me take you to Africa again,

00:09:45.796 --> 00:09:48.300
and introduce you to one of my very favorite,

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.130
the resurrection plant.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.477
Now here you'll find

00:09:51.477 --> 00:09:53.395
that even Jesus has competition.

00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:54.998
(Laughter)

00:09:54.998 --> 00:09:57.991
Now, this plant here has developed

00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:00.970
remarkable tolerance to drought,

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.068
which enables it to withstand

00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:07.313
up to 98 percent dehydration 
over the period of a year

00:10:07.313 --> 00:10:09.417
without damage,

00:10:09.417 --> 00:10:13.567
and yet it can regenerate 
itself almost completely

00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:17.647
overnight, over 24 hours, and flower.

00:10:17.647 --> 00:10:19.880
Now, us human beings,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.106
we're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth.

00:10:23.106 --> 00:10:24.940
We don't want to get old, and rightly so.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.179
Why should we, especially if you can afford it?

00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:30.362
And this gives you an indication

00:10:30.362 --> 00:10:33.164
of what the plant looks like before.

00:10:33.164 --> 00:10:36.020
Now, if you are an inexperienced gardener,

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.052
the first thing you'll do 
when you visit the garden

00:10:38.052 --> 00:10:40.776
is to uproot this plant because it's dead.

00:10:40.776 --> 00:10:45.578
But if you water it, this is what you get.

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.754
Absolutely amazing.

00:10:47.754 --> 00:10:50.250
Now, if you look at our aging process,

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.700
the aging process is in fact the loss of water

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.874
from the upper epidermis, resulting in wrinkling

00:10:55.874 --> 00:10:57.441
as we know it, especially women,

00:10:57.441 --> 00:10:59.282
we are so conscious of this.

00:10:59.282 --> 00:11:03.963
And this plant, in fact, is giving 
the cosmetic chemists

00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:05.953
very important ingredients

00:11:05.953 --> 00:11:08.720
that are actually finding ways

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.110
to slow down the aging process

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.490
and at the same time reinforce the cells

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.777
against the onslaught of environmental toxins.

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:20.414
Now, these four examples

00:11:20.414 --> 00:11:23.321
I have just given you

00:11:23.321 --> 00:11:26.755
are just a very tiny reminder

00:11:26.755 --> 00:11:30.492
as to how our health

00:11:30.492 --> 00:11:33.996
and our survival are closely linked

00:11:33.996 --> 00:11:36.808
to the health and the resilience

00:11:36.808 --> 00:11:38.653
of our ecosystem,

00:11:38.653 --> 00:11:40.587
and why we should be very careful

00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:43.288
about preserving biodiversity.

00:11:43.288 --> 00:11:46.490
Every time a forest is cut down,

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.110
every time a marsh is filled in,

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.860
it is a potential lab that goes with it,

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.168
and which we will never, ever recover.

00:11:56.168 --> 00:11:57.735
And I know what I'm talking about,

00:11:57.735 --> 00:12:01.067
coming from Mauritius and missing the dodo.

00:12:01.067 --> 00:12:05.425
Let me finish with just one last example.

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:09.240
Conservation issues are normally guided

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.208
towards rare, endemic plants,

00:12:12.208 --> 00:12:14.750
but what we call exotic plants,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.227
that is, the ones which grow in many
different habitats across the world,

00:12:18.227 --> 00:12:20.633
they also need to be considered.

00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:23.772
You know why? Because the environment plays

00:12:23.772 --> 00:12:25.527
a very important role

00:12:25.527 --> 00:12:28.186
in modifying the composition of that plant.

00:12:28.186 --> 00:12:30.817
So let's take a look at this plant here,

00:12:30.817 --> 00:12:33.300
Centella asiatica. It's a weed.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.448
We call it a weed.

00:12:35.448 --> 00:12:38.324
Now, Centella asiatica 
grows across the world

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:41.106
in many different habitats — 
in Africa, in Asia —

00:12:41.106 --> 00:12:43.125
and this plant has been instrumental

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:45.892
in providing a solution 
to that dreadful disease

00:12:45.892 --> 00:12:50.338
called leprosy in Madagascar in the 1940s.

00:12:50.338 --> 00:12:53.868
Now, while Centella 
grows across the world —

00:12:53.868 --> 00:12:57.159
in Africa, in Asia — 
the best quality Centella

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:59.503
comes from Madagascar,

00:12:59.503 --> 00:13:03.688
because that Centella contains
the three vital ingredients

00:13:03.688 --> 00:13:05.914
which are sought after by the pharma

00:13:05.914 --> 00:13:08.548
and the cosmetic companies.

00:13:08.548 --> 00:13:10.797
And the cosmetic companies 
are already using it

00:13:10.797 --> 00:13:13.879
to make regenerating cream.

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:16.668
Now, there is an ancient saying

00:13:16.668 --> 00:13:20.212
that for every disease known to mankind,

00:13:20.212 --> 00:13:22.394
there is a plant to cure it.

00:13:22.394 --> 00:13:24.622
Now, you may not 
believe in ancient sayings.

00:13:24.622 --> 00:13:26.185
You may think they're obsolete

00:13:26.185 --> 00:13:29.133
now that our science and 
technology are so powerful.

00:13:29.133 --> 00:13:31.169
So you may look on Centella as being

00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:34.374
an insignificant, humble weed,

00:13:34.374 --> 00:13:37.700
which, if destroyed, won't be missed.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.135
But you know, there is no such thing as a weed.

00:13:40.135 --> 00:13:41.889
It's a plant.

00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:44.768
It's a living biological lab

00:13:44.768 --> 00:13:46.669
that may well have answers

00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:48.627
to the question that we may have,

00:13:48.627 --> 00:13:50.517
but we have to ensure

00:13:50.517 --> 00:13:53.250
that it has the right to live.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.128
Thank you.

00:13:55.128 --> 00:13:59.128
(Applause)
