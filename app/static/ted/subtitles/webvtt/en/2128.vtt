00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:03.428
If there's any power in design,

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:05.771
that's the power of synthesis.

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.466
The more complex the problem,

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.967
the more the need for simplicity.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:12.304
So allow me to share three cases

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:14.114
where we tried to apply

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.117
design's power of synthesis.

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:21.218
Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization.

00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:24.896
It's a fact that people are moving towards cities.

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:28.361
and even if counterintuitive, it's good news.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:32.444
Evidence shows that people are better off in cities.

00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:34.593
But there's a problem that I would call

00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:36.899
the "3S" menace:

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.632
The scale, speed, and scarcity of means

00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:42.827
with which we will have to
respond to this phenomenon

00:00:42.827 --> 00:00:45.465
has no precedence in history.

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:46.654
For you to have an idea,

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:49.880
out of the three billion 
people living in cities today,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.271
one billion are under the line of poverty.

00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:57.210
By 2030, out of the five billion people

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.480
that will be living in cities,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.837
two billion are going to 
be under the line of poverty.

00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:07.266
That means that we will have to build

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:16.445
a one million-person city per week

00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:23.672
with 10,000 dollars per family

00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:25.482
during the next 15 years.

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:28.206
A one million-person city per week

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:30.330
with 10,000 dollars per family.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.995
If we don't solve this equation,

00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:34.043
it is not that people 
will stop coming to cities.

00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:35.952
They will come anyhow,

00:01:35.952 --> 00:01:38.958
but they will live in slums, favelas

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.368
and informal settlements.

00:01:40.368 --> 00:01:43.246
So what to do? Well, an answer may come

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:47.840
from favelas and slums themselves.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.433
A clue could be in this 
question we were asked

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:52.890
10 years ago.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.521
We were asked to accommodate 100 families

00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:58.939
that had been occupying illegally

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.234
half a hectare in the center

00:02:01.234 --> 00:02:04.134
of the city of Iquique 
in the north of Chile

00:02:04.134 --> 00:02:07.062
using a $10,000 subsidy

00:02:07.062 --> 00:02:10.176
with which we had to buy the land,

00:02:10.176 --> 00:02:11.909
provide the infrastructure,

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.230
and build the houses that, 
in the best of the cases,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.894
would be of around 40 square meters.

00:02:18.894 --> 00:02:21.099
And by the way, they said,

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.750
the cost of the land,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.806
because it's in the center of the city,

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:26.550
is three times more

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.108
than what social housing can normally afford.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.334
Due to the difficulty of the question,

00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:34.516
we decided to include the families

00:02:34.516 --> 00:02:38.612
in the process of understanding the constraints,

00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:41.193
and we started a participatory design process,

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:44.840
and testing what was 
available there in the market.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.538
Detached houses,

00:02:46.538 --> 00:02:49.494
30 families could be accommodated.

00:02:49.494 --> 00:02:53.456
Row houses, 60 families.

00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:56.598
["100 families"]
The only way to accommodate all of them

00:02:56.598 --> 00:02:58.920
was by building in height,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.552
and they threatened us

00:03:00.552 --> 00:03:02.860
to go on a hunger strike

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.158
if we even dared to offer this

00:03:05.158 --> 00:03:06.584
as a solution,

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:09.655
because they could not 
make the tiny apartments

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:11.109
expand.

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.798
So the conclusion with the families —

00:03:13.798 --> 00:03:15.676
and this is important, 
not our conclusion —

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:18.207
with the families, was that we had a problem.

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:19.945
We had to innovate.

00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:22.611
So what did we do?

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.619
Well, a middle-class family

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:30.499
lives reasonably well

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.850
in around 80 square meters,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.522
but when there's no money,

00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:35.864
what the market does

00:03:35.864 --> 00:03:40.122
is to reduce the size of the house

00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:42.971
to 40 square meters.

00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:44.719
What we said was,

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.239
what if,

00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:53.378
instead of thinking of 40 square meters

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:56.059
as a small house,

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:58.385
why don't we consider it

00:03:58.385 --> 00:04:01.191
half of a good one?

00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:02.958
When you rephrase the problem

00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.664
as half of a good house

00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:07.299
instead of a small one,

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.508
the key question is, which half do we do?

00:04:10.508 --> 00:04:13.210
And we thought we had 
to do with public money

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.619
the half that families won't 
be able to do individually.

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:21.147
We identified five design conditions

00:04:21.147 --> 00:04:23.505
that belonged to the hard half of a house,

00:04:23.505 --> 00:04:26.601
and we went back to the 
families to do two things:

00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:30.600
join forces and split tasks.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.584
Our design was something in between

00:04:33.584 --> 00:04:36.265
a building and a house.

00:04:36.265 --> 00:04:38.357
As a building, it could pay

00:04:38.357 --> 00:04:41.349
for expensive, well-located land,

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.970
and as a house, it could expand.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.554
If, in the process of not being expelled

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:49.920
to the periphery while getting a house,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.733
families kept their 
network and their jobs,

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:56.980
we knew that the expansion 
would begin right away.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.536
So we went from this initial social housing

00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:05.930
to a middle-class unit achieved
by families themselves

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.666
within a couple of weeks.

00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:10.439
This was our first project

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.766
in Iquique 10 years ago.

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:16.243
This is our last project in Chile.

00:05:16.243 --> 00:05:19.194
Different designs, same principle:

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.760
You provide the frame,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.598
and from then on, families take over.

00:05:24.598 --> 00:05:28.698
So the purpose of design,

00:05:28.698 --> 00:05:31.708
trying to understand and 
trying to give an answer

00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:33.360
to the "3S" menace,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.826
scale, speed, and scarcity,

00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:38.309
is to channel people's own building capacity.

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:42.714
We won't solve the one million
people per week equation

00:05:42.714 --> 00:05:47.399
unless we use people's own power for building.

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:49.634
So, with the right design,

00:05:49.634 --> 00:05:53.035
slums and favelas may not be the problem

00:05:53.035 --> 00:05:56.784
but actually the only possible solution.

00:05:56.784 --> 00:05:59.819
The second case is how design can contribute

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:01.871
to sustainability.

00:06:01.871 --> 00:06:04.264
In 2012, we entered the competition

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:06.830
for the Angelini Innovation Center,

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.842
and the aim was to build

00:06:08.842 --> 00:06:13.176
the right environment for knowledge creation.

00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:15.660
It is accepted that for such an aim,

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.196
knowledge creation,

00:06:17.196 --> 00:06:19.783
interaction among people, 
face-to-face contact,

00:06:19.783 --> 00:06:21.980
it's important, and we agreed on that.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.556
But for us, the question 
of the right environment

00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:27.722
was a very literal question.

00:06:27.722 --> 00:06:29.842
We wanted to have a working space

00:06:29.842 --> 00:06:32.595
with the right light, with the right temperature,

00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:34.477
with the right air.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.555
So we asked ourselves:

00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:39.145
Does the typical office building

00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:41.256
help us in that sense?

00:06:41.256 --> 00:06:44.870
Well, how does that 
building look, typically?

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.454
It's a collection of floors,

00:06:47.454 --> 00:06:49.361
one on top of each other,

00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:52.401
with a core in the center

00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:57.090
with elevators, stairs, 
pipes, wires, everything,

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.677
and then a glass skin on the outside

00:07:00.677 --> 00:07:04.553
that, due to direct sun radiation,

00:07:04.553 --> 00:07:09.761
creates a huge greenhouse effect inside.

00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:11.695
In addition to that, let's say a guy

00:07:11.695 --> 00:07:13.431
working on the seventh floor

00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:16.142
goes every single day 
through the third floor,

00:07:16.142 --> 00:07:19.180
but has no idea what the guy on that floor

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.909
is working on.

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:24.305
So we thought, well, maybe 
we have to turn this scheme

00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:26.106
inside out.

00:07:26.106 --> 00:07:27.928
And what we did was,

00:07:27.928 --> 00:07:32.110
let's have an open atrium,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.999
a hollowed core,

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:35.613
the same collection of floors,

00:07:35.613 --> 00:07:40.053
but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter,

00:07:40.053 --> 00:07:44.317
so that when the sun hits,

00:07:44.317 --> 00:07:50.444
it's not impacting directly glass, but a wall.

00:07:50.444 --> 00:07:53.181
When you have an open atrium inside,

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.330
you are able to see what others are doing

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.181
from within the building, and you have

00:07:57.181 --> 00:07:59.380
a better way to control light,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.783
and when you place the mass and the walls

00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:04.439
in the perimeter,

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:07.872
then you are preventing direct sun radiation.

00:08:07.872 --> 00:08:09.792
You may also open those windows

00:08:09.792 --> 00:08:12.688
and get cross-ventilation.

00:08:12.688 --> 00:08:15.623
We just made those openings

00:08:15.623 --> 00:08:17.715
of such a scale that they could work

00:08:17.715 --> 00:08:19.728
as elevated squares,

00:08:19.728 --> 00:08:21.472
outdoor spaces throughout

00:08:21.472 --> 00:08:25.135
the entire height of the building.

00:08:25.135 --> 00:08:26.984
None of this is rocket science.

00:08:26.984 --> 00:08:29.683
You don't require sophisticated programming.

00:08:29.683 --> 00:08:31.416
It's not about technology.

00:08:31.416 --> 00:08:36.838
This is just archaic, 
primitive common sense,

00:08:36.838 --> 00:08:38.806
and by using common sense,

00:08:38.806 --> 00:08:41.787
we went from 120 kilowatts

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:44.127
per square meter per year,

00:08:44.127 --> 00:08:46.298
which is the typical energy consumption

00:08:46.298 --> 00:08:48.290
for cooling a glass tower,

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.620
to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.897
So with the right design,

00:08:54.897 --> 00:08:57.441
sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use

00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:01.174
of common sense.

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:04.147
Last case I would like 
to share is how design

00:09:04.147 --> 00:09:06.442
can provide more comprehensive answers

00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:08.830
against natural disasters.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.895
You may know that Chile, in 2010,

00:09:11.895 --> 00:09:15.700
was hit by an 8.8 Richter scale

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.823
earthquake and tsunami,

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.698
and we were called to work

00:09:19.698 --> 00:09:21.940
in the reconstruction of the Constitución,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.850
in the southern part of the country.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.347
We were given 100 days, three months,

00:09:27.347 --> 00:09:29.263
to design almost everything,

00:09:29.263 --> 00:09:31.580
from public buildings to public space,

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.670
street grid, transportation, housing,

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.424
and mainly how to protect the city

00:09:36.424 --> 00:09:38.679
against future tsunamis.

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:41.829
This was new in Chilean urban design,

00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:45.202
and there were in the 
air a couple of alternatives.

00:09:45.202 --> 00:09:46.454
First one:

00:09:46.454 --> 00:09:49.103
Forbid installation on ground zero.

00:09:49.103 --> 00:09:51.140
Thirty million dollars spent mainly

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.524
in land expropriation.

00:09:53.524 --> 00:09:56.786
This is exactly what's being
discussed in Japan nowadays,

00:09:56.786 --> 00:09:58.833
and if you have a disciplined population

00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:01.173
like the Japanese, this may work,

00:10:01.173 --> 00:10:02.658
but we know that in Chile,

00:10:02.658 --> 00:10:06.471
this land is going to be 
occupied illegally anyhow,

00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:10.543
so this alternative was 
unrealistic and undesirable.

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:13.936
Second alternative: build a big wall,

00:10:13.936 --> 00:10:16.253
heavy infrastructure to resist

00:10:16.253 --> 00:10:18.195
the energy of the waves.

00:10:18.195 --> 00:10:20.314
This alternative was conveniently lobbied

00:10:20.314 --> 00:10:21.675
by big building companies,

00:10:21.675 --> 00:10:25.882
because it meant 42 million 
dollars in contracts,

00:10:25.882 --> 00:10:28.235
and was also politically preferred,

00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:32.227
because it required no land expropriation.

00:10:32.227 --> 00:10:34.977
But Japan proved that trying to resist

00:10:34.977 --> 00:10:38.290
the force of nature is useless.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.653
So this alternative was irresponsible.

00:10:41.653 --> 00:10:43.747
As in the housing process,

00:10:43.747 --> 00:10:45.624
we had to include the community

00:10:45.624 --> 00:10:48.972
in the way of finding a solution for this,

00:10:48.972 --> 00:10:52.145
and we started a participatory design process.

00:10:52.145 --> 00:10:54.416
(Video) [In Spanish] Loudspeaker:
What kind of city do you want?

00:10:54.416 --> 00:10:55.958
Vote for Constitución.

00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.263
Go to the Open House and express your options.

00:10:58.263 --> 00:11:00.436
Participate!

00:11:00.436 --> 00:11:02.510
Fisherman: I am a fisherman.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.619
Twenty-five fishermen work for me.

00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:06.958
Where should I take them? To the forest?

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.343
Man: So why can't we have a concrete defense?

00:11:10.343 --> 00:11:12.251
Done well, of course.

00:11:12.251 --> 00:11:14.141
Man 2: I am the history of Constitución.

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:18.101
And you come here to tell me
that I cannot keep on living here?

00:11:18.101 --> 00:11:20.299
My whole family has lived here,

00:11:20.299 --> 00:11:21.771
I raised my children here,

00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:23.856
and my children will also 
raise their children here.

00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:26.364
and my grandchildren 
and everyone else will.

00:11:26.364 --> 00:11:28.890
But why are you imposing this on me?

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.767
You! You are imposing this on me!

00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:32.558
In danger zone I am not authorized to build.

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:34.145
He himself is saying that.

00:11:34.145 --> 00:11:36.230
Man 3: No, no, no, Nieves...

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.228
Alejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able

00:11:41.228 --> 00:11:43.513
to read the subtitles, but you can tell

00:11:43.513 --> 00:11:45.157
from the body language

00:11:45.157 --> 00:11:46.435
that participatory design

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:48.759
is not a hippie, romantic,

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:52.010
let's-all-dream-together-about-
the-future-of-the-city

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.077
kind of thing.

00:11:54.077 --> 00:11:57.570
It is actually — (Applause)

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.970
It is actually not even with the families

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.016
trying to find the right answer.

00:12:03.016 --> 00:12:05.829
It is mainly trying to identify with precision

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:07.900
what is the right question.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.987
There is nothing worse than answering well

00:12:09.987 --> 00:12:12.091
the wrong question.

00:12:12.091 --> 00:12:15.410
So it was pretty obvious after this process

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.941
that, well, we chicken out here

00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:21.517
and go away because it's too tense,

00:12:21.517 --> 00:12:23.543
or we go even further in asking,

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:24.938
what else is bothering you?

00:12:24.938 --> 00:12:26.691
What other problems do you have

00:12:26.691 --> 00:12:29.273
and you want us to take 
care of now that the city

00:12:29.273 --> 00:12:33.595
will have to be rethought from scratch?

00:12:33.595 --> 00:12:35.791
And what they said was,

00:12:35.791 --> 00:12:38.577
look, fine to protect the city 
against future tsunamis,

00:12:38.577 --> 00:12:43.334
we really appreciate, but the next one 
is going to come in, what, 20 years?

00:12:43.334 --> 00:12:45.427
But every single year, we have problems

00:12:45.427 --> 00:12:48.290
of flooding due to rain.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.490
In addition, we are in the middle

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.289
of the forest region of the country,

00:12:52.289 --> 00:12:55.109
and our public space sucks.

00:12:55.109 --> 00:12:58.900
It's poor and it's scarce.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.484
And the origin of the city, our identity,

00:13:01.484 --> 00:13:04.370
is not really connected to the buildings that fell,

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.984
it is connected to the river,

00:13:05.984 --> 00:13:08.798
but the river cannot be accessed publicly,

00:13:08.798 --> 00:13:12.500
because its shores are privately owned.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.303
So we thought that we had
to produce a third alternative,

00:13:17.303 --> 00:13:21.847
and our approach was 
against geographical threats,

00:13:21.847 --> 00:13:25.467
have geographical answers.

00:13:25.467 --> 00:13:29.254
What if, in between the city

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.983
and the sea

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.768
we have a forest,

00:13:39.768 --> 00:13:42.354
a forest that doesn't try to resist

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:44.212
the energy of nature,

00:13:44.212 --> 00:13:48.271
but dissipates it by introducing friction?

00:13:48.271 --> 00:13:52.164
A forest that may be able to laminate the water

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:54.515
and prevent the flooding?

00:13:54.515 --> 00:13:59.599
That may pay the historical debt of public space,

00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:02.242
and that may provide, finally,

00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:04.660
democratic access to the river.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.601
So as a conclusion of the participatory design,

00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:10.604
the alternative was validated politically and socially,

00:14:10.604 --> 00:14:13.715
but there was still the problem of the cost:

00:14:13.715 --> 00:14:16.919
48 million dollars.

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:19.323
So what we did was a survey

00:14:19.323 --> 00:14:21.875
in the public investment system,

00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:24.190
and found out that there 
were three ministries

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.333
with three projects in 
the exact same place,

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:30.297
not knowing of the existence 
of the other projects.

00:14:30.297 --> 00:14:34.634
The sum of them: 52 million dollars.

00:14:34.634 --> 00:14:37.310
So design's power of synthesis

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.426
is trying to make a more efficient use

00:14:39.426 --> 00:14:42.283
of the scarcest resource in cities,

00:14:42.283 --> 00:14:45.696
which is not money but coordination.

00:14:45.696 --> 00:14:48.478
By doing so, we were able to save

00:14:48.478 --> 00:14:51.320
four million dollars, and 
that is why the forest

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.900
is today under construction.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.516
(Applause)

00:14:57.516 --> 00:15:01.140
So be it the force of self construction,

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.245
the force of common sense,

00:15:04.245 --> 00:15:07.350
or the force of nature, all these forces

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.781
need to be translated into form,

00:15:10.781 --> 00:15:14.447
and what that form is modeling and shaping

00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:17.677
is not cement, bricks, or wood.

00:15:17.677 --> 00:15:19.922
It is life itself.

00:15:19.922 --> 00:15:22.260
Design's power of synthesis

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.680
is just an attempt to put

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.312
at the innermost core of architecture

00:15:28.312 --> 00:15:30.180
the force of life.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.969
Thank you so much.

00:15:32.969 --> 00:15:36.890
(Applause)
