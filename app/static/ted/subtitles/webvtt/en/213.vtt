00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I hope you'll understand my English.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In the mornings it is terrible, and the afternoon is worst.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
(Laughter)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
During many years, I made some speeches starting with this

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
saying: "City is not a problem, it's a solution."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And more and more, I'm convinced that

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it's not only a solution for a country,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but it's a solution for the problem of climate change.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm working in cities for almost 40 years,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or the other mayors say, "We don't have financial resources,"

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I would like to say

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
from the experience I had: every city in the world

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
can be improved in less than three years.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
There's no matter of scale. It's not a question of scale,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
it's not a question of financial resources.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and also a design.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So to start, I want to introduce some characters

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
from a book I made for teenagers.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The best example of quality of life is the turtle

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
because the turtle is an example of living and working together.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And when you realize that the casque of the turtle

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
looks like an urban tessitura,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and can we imagine, if we cut the casque of the turtle, how sad she's going to be?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And that's what we're doing in our cities:

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
living here, working here, having leisure here.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And most of the people are leaving the city

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and living outside of the city.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So, the other character is Otto, the automobile.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
He is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The chairs are on the tables and still drinking,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and he drinks a lot. (Laughter)

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And he coughs a lot. Very egotistical:

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
he carries only one or two people

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and he asks always for more infrastructure.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Freeways.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
He's a very demanding person.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And on the other hand, Accordion, the friendly bus,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
he carries 300 people --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:21.000
275 in Sweden; 300 Brazilians. (Laughter)

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Speaking about the design: every city has its own design.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Curitiba, my city: three million in the metropolitan area,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
1,800,000 people in the city itself.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Curitiba, Rio: it's like two birds kissing themselves.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Oaxaca, San Francisco -- it's very easy:

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Market Street, Van Ness and the waterfront.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And every city has its own design.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But to make it happen, sometimes you have to propose a scenario

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and to propose a design --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
an idea that everyone, or the large majority,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
will help you to make it happen.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And that's the structure of the city of Curitiba.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And it's an example of living and working together.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And this is where we have more density;

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
it's where we have more public transport.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So, this system started in '74. We started with 25,000 passengers a day,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
now it's 2,200,000 passengers a day.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And it took 25 years until another city ...

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
which is Bogota, and they did a very good job.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And now there's 83 cities all over the world that they

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And one thing: it's important not for only your own city;

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
every city, besides its normal problems,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
they have a very important role

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
in being with the whole humanity.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
That means mostly two main issues --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
mobility and sustainability -- are becoming very important for the cities.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And this is an articulated bus, double-articulated.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And we are very close to my house.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And that's the evolution of the system.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
What in the design that made the difference

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
is the boarding tubes:

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
That's why, I'm trying to say,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
it's like metro-nizing the bus.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
This is the design of the bus,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And for handicapped, they can use this as a normal system.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
What I'm trying to say is

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000
more than 50 percent -- so when we depend only on cars, it's ...

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
-- that's why when we're talking about sustainability,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
it's not enough, green buildings.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It's not enough, a new materials.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It's not enough, new sources of energy.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It's the concept of the city, the design of the city,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:51.000
that's also important, too. And also, how to teach the children.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I'll speak on this later on.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Our idea of mobility is trying

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to make the connections between all the systems.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
We started in '83, proposing for the city of Rio

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
how to connect the subway with the bus.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
The subway was against, of course.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And 23 years after, they called us to develop -- we're developing this idea.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And you can understand how different it's going to be,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
the image of Rio with the system --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
one-minute frequency.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And it's not Shanghai,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
it's not being colored during the day, only at night

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
it will look this way.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And before you say it's a Norman Foster design,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
we designed this in '83.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And this is the model,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
how it's going to work. So, it's the same system;

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
the vehicle is different. And that's the model.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
What I'm trying to say is, I'm not trying

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
to prove which system of transport is better.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I'm trying to say we have to combine

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
all the systems, and with one condition:

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
never -- if you have a subway, if you have surface systems,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
if you have any kind of system --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
never compete in the same space.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And coming back to the car, I always used to say

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
that the car is like your mother-in-law:

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
you have to have good relationship with her,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
but she cannot command your life.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So, when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
you have a problem. (Laughter)

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So, all the ideas about how to transform through design --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000
old quarries and open universities and botanic garden --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
all of it's related to how we teach the children.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And the children, we teach during six months how to separate their garbage.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And after, the children teach their parents.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And now we have 70 percent --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
since 20 years, it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Seven zero.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
(Applause)

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
So teach the children.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I would like to say, if we want to have a sustainable world

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
we have to work with everything what's said,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
but don't forget the cities and the children.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
because you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
You should have always

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
a structure of living and working together.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Try to understand the sectors in the city

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that could play different roles during the 24 hours.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Another issue is, a city's like our family portrait.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
We don't rip our family portrait,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
even if we don't like the nose of our uncle,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
because this portrait is you.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And these are the references that we have in any city.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
This is the main pedestrian mall;

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
we did it in 72 hours. Yes, you have to be fast.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And these are the references from our ethnic contribution.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
This is the Italian portal,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the Ukrainian park, the Polish park, the Japanese square, the German park.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
All of a sudden, the Soviet Union, they split.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And since we have people from

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, [unclear],

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
we have to stop the program.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
(Laughter)

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Don't forget: creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
If you cut two zeros, it's much better.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And this is the Wire Opera theater. We did it in two months.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Quarries once made the nature, and

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
sometimes we took this and we transformed.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And every part can be transformed;

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
every frog can be transformed in a prince.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So, in a city, you have to work fast.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Planning takes time. And I'm proposing urban acupuncture.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000
That means me, with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And this is an acupuncture note --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000
or I.M. Pei's. Some small ones

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
can make the city better.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The smallest park in New York, the most beautiful:

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
32 meters.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So, I want just to end saying

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials --

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
but keep in mind that we have to work fast

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:23.000
to the end, because we don't have the whole time to plan.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And I think creativity, innovation is starting.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And we cannot have all the answers.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
So when you start --

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers --

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
it's important starting and having the contribution from people,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and they could teach you

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
if you're not in the right track.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000
At the end, I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
OK?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Please, allow me just two minutes.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
You're going to make the music and the rhythm.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
♫ Toonchi-too! Toonchi-too! Toonchi-too! ♫

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
♫ Toonchi-too! Toonchi-too! Toonchi-too! ♫
