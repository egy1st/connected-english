00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:04.975
What has the War on Drugs 
done to the world?

00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:07.152
Look at the murder and mayhem in Mexico,

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:10.999
Central America, so many 
other parts of the planet,

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.799
the global black market estimated

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.375
at 300 billion dollars a year,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.817
prisons packed in the 
United States and elsewhere,

00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:21.495
police and military drawn 
into an unwinnable war

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:24.757
that violates basic rights, 
and ordinary citizens

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:27.738
just hope they don't get 
caught in the crossfire,

00:00:27.738 --> 00:00:30.100
and meanwhile, more people using

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.361
more drugs than ever.

00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:34.656
It's my country's history 
with alcohol prohibition

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:37.783
and Al Capone, times 50.

00:00:37.783 --> 00:00:41.336
Which is why it's 
particularly galling to me

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:44.465
as an American that we've 
been the driving force

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:46.501
behind this global drug war.

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:48.503
Ask why so many countries criminalize

00:00:48.503 --> 00:00:50.292
drugs they'd never heard of,

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:53.318
why the U.N. drug treaties emphasize

00:00:53.318 --> 00:00:55.540
criminalization over health,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.884
even why most of the money worldwide

00:00:57.884 --> 00:00:59.549
for dealing with drug abuse goes not

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.320
to helping agencies but those that punish,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.639
and you'll find the good old U.S. of A.

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:07.817
Why did we do this?

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:11.113
Some people, especially in Latin America,

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:12.846
think it's not really about drugs.

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:15.009
It's just a subterfuge for advancing

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.167
the realpolitik interests of the U.S.

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:21.530
But by and large, that's not it.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.443
We don't want gangsters and guerrillas

00:01:24.443 --> 00:01:26.513
funded with illegal drug money

00:01:26.513 --> 00:01:29.629
terrorizing and taking over other nations.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:34.200
No, the fact is, America really is crazy

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.040
when it comes to drugs.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.200
I mean, don't forget, we're 
the ones who thought

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.866
that we could prohibit alcohol.

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.149
So think about our global drug war

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.885
not as any sort of rational policy,

00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:47.627
but as the international projection

00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:51.114
of a domestic psychosis.

00:01:51.114 --> 00:01:54.160
(Applause)

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.827
But here's the good news.

00:01:55.827 --> 00:01:59.120
Now it's the Russians leading
the Drug War and not us.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.700
Most politicians in my country

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.021
want to roll back the Drug War now,

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.833
put fewer people behind bars, not more,

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.342
and I'm proud to say as an American

00:02:07.342 --> 00:02:08.926
that we now lead the world

00:02:08.926 --> 00:02:11.166
in reforming marijuana policies.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.112
It's now legal for medical purposes

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:14.912
in almost half our 50 states,

00:02:14.912 --> 00:02:17.274
millions of people can 
purchase their marijuana,

00:02:17.274 --> 00:02:20.190
their medicine, in government-
licensed dispensaries,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.270
and over half my fellow 
citizens now say it's time

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.643
to legally regulate and tax marijuana

00:02:25.643 --> 00:02:27.320
more or less like alcohol.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.287
That's what Colorado and 
Washington are doing,

00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:33.673
and Uruguay, and others 
are sure to follow.

00:02:33.673 --> 00:02:36.161
So that's what I do:

00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:39.967
work to end the Drug War.

00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:42.626
I think it all started growing up

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:45.205
in a fairly religious, moral family,

00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:47.241
eldest son of a rabbi,

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:49.412
going off to university where I

00:02:49.412 --> 00:02:52.762
smoked some marijuana

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:54.980
and I liked it. (Laughter)

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.455
And I liked drinking too, but it was obvious

00:02:57.455 --> 00:02:59.930
that alcohol was really the
more dangerous of the two,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.617
but my friends and I could get busted

00:03:01.617 --> 00:03:03.190
for smoking a joint.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.749
Now, that hypocrisy kept bugging me,

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.690
so I wrote my Ph.D dissertation
on international drug control.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.180
I talked my way into the State Department.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.409
I got a security clearance.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.373
I interviewed hundreds of DEA
and other law enforcement agents

00:03:15.373 --> 00:03:17.530
all around Europe and the Americas,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.761
and I'd ask them,

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.385
"What do you think the answer is?"

00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:24.165
Well, in Latin America, they'd say to me,

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:26.980
"You can't really cut off the supply.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.534
The answer lies back in the U.S.,

00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:30.337
in cutting off the demand."

00:03:30.337 --> 00:03:32.853
So then I go back home and I talk to people

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:35.453
involved in anti-drug efforts there, and they'd say,

00:03:35.453 --> 00:03:38.681
"You know, Ethan, you can't 
really cut off the demand.

00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:41.628
The answer lies over there.
You've got to cut off the supply."

00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:44.238
Then I'd go and talk 
to the guys in customs

00:03:44.238 --> 00:03:46.600
trying to stop drugs at the borders,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.817
and they'd say, "You're 
not going to stop it here.

00:03:49.817 --> 00:03:51.786
The answer lies over there,

00:03:51.786 --> 00:03:54.778
in cutting off supply and demand."

00:03:54.778 --> 00:03:56.408
And it hit me:

00:03:56.408 --> 00:03:58.693
Everybody involved in this

00:03:58.693 --> 00:04:01.133
thought the answer lay in that area

00:04:01.133 --> 00:04:04.141
about which they knew the least.

00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:06.645
So that's when I started 
reading everything I could

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:09.525
about psychoactive drugs: 
the history, the science,

00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:11.630
the politics, all of it,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.946
and the more one read,

00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:16.488
the more it hit you how a thoughtful,

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:19.852
enlightened, intelligent 
approach took you over here,

00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:22.360
whereas the politics and laws of my country

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.396
were taking you over here.

00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:28.187
And that disparity struck me as this incredible

00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:32.354
intellectual and moral puzzle.

00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:36.411
There's probably never been

00:04:36.411 --> 00:04:39.020
a drug-free society.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.770
Virtually every society

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.171
has ingested psychoactive substances

00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:46.786
to deal with pain, increase 
our energy, socialize,

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.819
even commune with God.

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.507
Our desire to alter our consciousness

00:04:51.507 --> 00:04:53.937
may be as fundamental as our desires

00:04:53.937 --> 00:04:57.854
for food, companionship and sex.

00:04:57.854 --> 00:04:59.991
So our true challenge

00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:02.871
is to learn how to live with drugs

00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:05.627
so they cause the least possible harm

00:05:05.627 --> 00:05:09.840
and in some cases the 
greatest possible benefit.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.910
I'll tell you something else I learned,

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.998
that the reason some drugs 
are legal and others not

00:05:14.998 --> 00:05:17.956
has almost nothing to do 
with science or health

00:05:17.956 --> 00:05:19.789
or the relative risk of drugs,

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.185
and almost everything to do with who uses

00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:25.313
and who is perceived 
to use particular drugs.

00:05:25.313 --> 00:05:27.383
In the late 19th century,

00:05:27.383 --> 00:05:30.723
when most of the drugs that
are now illegal were legal,

00:05:30.723 --> 00:05:33.435
the principal consumers 
of opiates in my country

00:05:33.435 --> 00:05:37.239
and others were middle-aged white women,

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:39.598
using them to alleviate aches and pains

00:05:39.598 --> 00:05:42.320
when few other analgesics were available.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.481
And nobody thought about 
criminalizing it back then

00:05:44.481 --> 00:05:47.478
because nobody wanted to 
put Grandma behind bars.

00:05:47.478 --> 00:05:49.936
But when hundreds of thousands of Chinese

00:05:49.936 --> 00:05:51.725
started showing up in my country,

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:54.323
working hard on the railroads and the mines

00:05:54.323 --> 00:05:55.802
and then kicking back in the evening

00:05:55.802 --> 00:05:57.506
just like they had in the old country

00:05:57.506 --> 00:06:00.163
with a few puffs on that opium pipe,

00:06:00.163 --> 00:06:02.480
that's when you saw the 
first drug prohibition laws

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.280
in California and Nevada,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.158
driven by racist fears of Chinese

00:06:06.158 --> 00:06:07.994
transforming white women

00:06:07.994 --> 00:06:11.378
into opium-addicted sex slaves.

00:06:11.378 --> 00:06:14.213
The first cocaine prohibition 
laws, similarly prompted

00:06:14.213 --> 00:06:17.980
by racist fears of black men 
sniffing that white powder

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.859
and forgetting their proper place

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:21.813
in Southern society.

00:06:21.813 --> 00:06:23.796
And the first marijuana prohibition laws,

00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:25.869
all about fears of Mexican migrants

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:29.645
in the West and the Southwest.

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:32.379
And what was true in my country,

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:34.876
is true in so many others as well,

00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:37.120
with both the origins of these laws

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.543
and their implementation.

00:06:40.543 --> 00:06:42.160
Put it this way,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.841
and I exaggerate only slightly:

00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:47.923
If the principal smokers of cocaine

00:06:47.923 --> 00:06:49.917
were affluent older white men

00:06:49.917 --> 00:06:52.906
and the principal consumers of Viagra

00:06:52.906 --> 00:06:54.800
were poor young black men,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.912
then smokable cocaine would be easy to
get with a prescription from your doctor

00:06:57.912 --> 00:07:01.197
and selling Viagra would get you 
five to 10 years behind bars.

00:07:01.197 --> 00:07:04.981
(Applause)

00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:08.835
I used to be a professor teaching about this.

00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:12.490
Now I'm an activist, a human rights activist,

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.251
and what drives me is my shame

00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:17.429
at living in an otherwise great nation

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:20.212
that has less than five percent
of the world's population

00:07:20.212 --> 00:07:23.840
but almost 25 percent of the
world's incarcerated population.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.241
It's the people I meet 
who have lost someone

00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:28.795
they love to drug-related 
violence or prison

00:07:28.795 --> 00:07:30.257
or overdose or AIDS

00:07:30.257 --> 00:07:32.237
because our drug policies emphasize

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:34.261
criminalization over health.

00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:37.490
It's good people who have lost their jobs,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.120
their homes, their freedom, 
even their children

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.588
to the state, not because they hurt anyone

00:07:44.588 --> 00:07:47.813
but solely because they chose to use one drug

00:07:47.813 --> 00:07:50.827
instead of another.

00:07:50.827 --> 00:07:55.176
So is legalization the answer?

00:07:55.176 --> 00:07:57.213
On that, I'm torn:

00:07:57.213 --> 00:08:00.396
three days a week I think yes,
three days a week I think no,

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:02.616
and on Sundays I'm agnostic.

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:05.142
But since today is Tuesday,

00:08:05.142 --> 00:08:09.844
let me just say that legally 
regulating and taxing

00:08:09.844 --> 00:08:12.262
most of the drugs that 
are now criminalized

00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:14.636
would radically reduce 
the crime, violence,

00:08:14.636 --> 00:08:16.368
corruption and black markets,

00:08:16.368 --> 00:08:19.405
and the problems of adulterated
and unregulated drugs,

00:08:19.405 --> 00:08:21.352
and improve public safety,

00:08:21.352 --> 00:08:23.556
and allow taxpayer resources to be developed

00:08:23.556 --> 00:08:25.772
to more useful purposes.

00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:29.552
I mean, look, the markets 
in marijuana, cocaine,

00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:31.565
heroin and methamphetamine

00:08:31.565 --> 00:08:34.130
are global commodities markets

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.325
just like the global markets 
in alcohol, tobacco,

00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:40.205
coffee, sugar, and so many other things.

00:08:40.205 --> 00:08:42.601
Where there is a demand,

00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:45.124
there will be a supply.

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:47.280
Knock out one source and another

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.990
inevitably emerges.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.370
People tend to think of prohibition

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.868
as the ultimate form of regulation

00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:57.887
when in fact it represents 
the abdication of regulation

00:08:57.887 --> 00:09:01.904
with criminals filling the void.

00:09:01.904 --> 00:09:04.164
Which is why putting criminal laws and police

00:09:04.164 --> 00:09:07.382
front and center in trying to control

00:09:07.382 --> 00:09:10.486
a dynamic global commodities market

00:09:10.486 --> 00:09:13.355
is a recipe for disaster.

00:09:13.355 --> 00:09:15.526
And what we really need to do

00:09:15.526 --> 00:09:17.900
is to bring the underground drug markets

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.813
as much as possible aboveground

00:09:20.813 --> 00:09:24.885
and regulate them as 
intelligently as we can

00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:27.674
to minimize both the harms of drugs

00:09:27.674 --> 00:09:31.162
and the harms of prohibitionist policies.

00:09:31.162 --> 00:09:34.727
Now, with marijuana, that obviously means

00:09:34.727 --> 00:09:37.393
legally regulating and 
taxing it like alcohol.

00:09:37.393 --> 00:09:40.723
The benefits of doing so are
enormous, the risks minimal.

00:09:40.723 --> 00:09:43.434
Will more people use marijuana?

00:09:43.434 --> 00:09:47.405
Maybe, but it's not 
going to be young people,

00:09:47.405 --> 00:09:49.407
because it's not going to 
be legalized for them,

00:09:49.407 --> 00:09:51.218
and quite frankly, they already have

00:09:51.218 --> 00:09:53.254
the best access to marijuana.

00:09:53.254 --> 00:09:55.403
I think it's going to be older people.

00:09:55.403 --> 00:09:57.562
It's going to be people in their 40s and 60s

00:09:57.562 --> 00:10:01.208
and 80s who find they prefer a little marijuana

00:10:01.208 --> 00:10:04.498
to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill

00:10:04.498 --> 00:10:08.138
or that it helps with 
their arthritis or diabetes

00:10:08.138 --> 00:10:13.330
or maybe helps spice up a 
long-term marriage. (Laughter)

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.484
And that just might be a 
net public health benefit.

00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:18.846
As for the other drugs,

00:10:18.846 --> 00:10:21.467
look at Portugal, where 
nobody goes to jail

00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:23.230
for possessing drugs,

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.600
and the government's made 
a serious commitment

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.810
to treating addiction as a health issue.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.711
Look at Switzerland, 
Germany, the Netherlands,

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:30.657
Denmark, England, where people who have

00:10:30.657 --> 00:10:32.558
been addicted to heroin for many years

00:10:32.558 --> 00:10:34.864
and repeatedly tried to quit and failed

00:10:34.864 --> 00:10:37.722
can get pharmaceutical 
heroin and helping services

00:10:37.722 --> 00:10:41.163
in medical clinics, and 
the results are in:

00:10:41.163 --> 00:10:44.227
Illegal drug abuse and disease

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:48.374
and overdoses and crime 
and arrests all go down,

00:10:48.374 --> 00:10:50.523
health and well-being improve,

00:10:50.523 --> 00:10:52.255
taxpayers benefit,

00:10:52.255 --> 00:10:56.405
and many drug users even
put their addictions behind them.

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:59.207
Look at New Zealand, which 
recently enacted a law

00:10:59.207 --> 00:11:02.142
allowing certain recreational 
drugs to be sold legally

00:11:02.142 --> 00:11:04.843
provided their safety had been established.

00:11:04.843 --> 00:11:07.542
Look here in Brazil, and some other countries,

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:10.605
where a remarkable psychoactive substance,

00:11:10.605 --> 00:11:13.830
ayahuasca, can be legally 
bought and consumed

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.958
provided it's done so 
within a religious context.

00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.960
Look in Bolivia and Peru,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.749
where all sorts of products 
made from the coca leaf,

00:11:21.749 --> 00:11:23.650
the source of cocaine,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.270
are sold legally over the counter

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.403
with no apparent harm to people's public health.

00:11:28.403 --> 00:11:32.439
I mean, don't forget, Coca-Cola
had cocaine in it until 1900,

00:11:32.439 --> 00:11:34.407
and so far as we know was no more addictive

00:11:34.407 --> 00:11:38.460
than Coca-Cola is today.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.537
Conversely, think about cigarettes:

00:11:41.537 --> 00:11:46.523
Nothing can both hook you 
and kill you like cigarettes.

00:11:46.523 --> 00:11:49.587
When researchers ask heroin addicts

00:11:49.587 --> 00:11:52.793
what's the toughest drug to 
quit, most say cigarettes.

00:11:52.793 --> 00:11:55.167
Yet in my country and many others,

00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:57.709
half of all the people who 
were ever addicted

00:11:57.709 --> 00:11:59.644
to cigarettes have quit

00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:02.652
without anyone being 
arrested or put in jail

00:12:02.652 --> 00:12:04.908
or sent to a "treatment program"

00:12:04.908 --> 00:12:06.641
by a prosecutor or a judge.

00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:09.937
What did it were higher taxes

00:12:09.937 --> 00:12:13.480
and time and place 
restrictions on sale and use

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.552
and effective anti-smoking campaigns.

00:12:16.552 --> 00:12:20.492
Now, could we reduce smoking even more

00:12:20.492 --> 00:12:24.831
by making it totally illegal? Probably.

00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:28.442
But just imagine the drug war nightmare

00:12:28.442 --> 00:12:31.480
that would result.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.763
So the challenges we face today

00:12:33.763 --> 00:12:35.630
are twofold.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.645
The first is the policy challenge

00:12:38.645 --> 00:12:42.323
of designing and implementing alternatives

00:12:42.323 --> 00:12:44.741
to ineffective prohibitionist policies,

00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:48.161
even as we need to get 
better at regulating

00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:51.830
and living with the drugs 
that are now legal.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.191
But the second challenge is tougher,

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:58.802
because it's about us.

00:12:58.802 --> 00:13:02.290
The obstacles to reform 
lie not just out there

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.450
in the power of the 
prison industrial complex

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.654
or other vested interests 
that want to keep things

00:13:06.654 --> 00:13:08.080
the way they are,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.920
but within each and every one of us.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.970
It's our fears and our lack of knowledge

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:22.670
and imagination that stands 
in the way of real reform.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:27.240
And ultimately, I think that 
boils down to the kids,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.985
and to every parent's desire
to put our baby in a bubble,

00:13:30.985 --> 00:13:34.315
and the fear that somehow
drugs will pierce that bubble

00:13:34.315 --> 00:13:36.244
and put our young ones at risk.

00:13:36.244 --> 00:13:38.314
In fact, sometimes it 
seems like the entire

00:13:38.314 --> 00:13:40.290
War on Drugs gets justified

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.216
as one great big child protection act,

00:13:44.216 --> 00:13:47.823
which any young person 
can tell you it's not.

00:13:47.823 --> 00:13:51.929
So here's what I say to teenagers.

00:13:51.929 --> 00:13:55.615
First, don't do drugs.

00:13:55.615 --> 00:13:59.405
Second, don't do drugs.

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:02.825
Third, if you do do drugs,

00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:05.367
there's some things I want you to know,

00:14:05.367 --> 00:14:09.410
because my bottom line as your parent is,

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.391
come home safely at the end of the night

00:14:12.391 --> 00:14:15.924
and grow up and lead a 
healthy and good adulthood.

00:14:15.924 --> 00:14:21.537
That's my drug education 
mantra: Safety first.

00:14:21.537 --> 00:14:25.193
So this is what I've dedicated my life to,

00:14:25.193 --> 00:14:27.701
to building an organization and a movement

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:30.561
of people who believe we 
need to turn our backs

00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:32.606
on the failed prohibitions of the past

00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:35.305
and embrace new drug 
policies grounded in science,

00:14:35.305 --> 00:14:38.246
compassion, health and human rights,

00:14:38.246 --> 00:14:40.884
where people who come from
across the political spectrum

00:14:40.884 --> 00:14:42.865
and every other spectrum as well,

00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:44.599
where people who love our drugs,

00:14:44.599 --> 00:14:45.938
people who hate drugs,

00:14:45.938 --> 00:14:48.250
and people who don't give 
a damn about drugs,

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.684
but every one of us believes 
that this War on Drugs,

00:14:51.684 --> 00:14:55.931
this backward, heartless, 
disastrous War on Drugs,

00:14:55.931 --> 00:14:59.030
has got to end.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.873
Thank you.

00:15:00.873 --> 00:15:05.880
(Applause)

00:15:15.042 --> 00:15:17.722
Thank you. Thank you.

00:15:17.722 --> 00:15:19.943
Chris Anderson: Ethan,

00:15:19.943 --> 00:15:23.182
congrats — quite the reaction.

00:15:23.182 --> 00:15:25.926
That was a powerful talk.

00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:29.234
Not quite a complete standing O, though,

00:15:29.234 --> 00:15:30.921
and I'm guessing that some people here

00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:33.187
and maybe a few watching online,

00:15:33.187 --> 00:15:37.287
maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend

00:15:37.287 --> 00:15:39.504
or whatever who got sick,

00:15:39.504 --> 00:15:42.500
maybe died from some drug overdose.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.386
I'm sure you've had these
people approach you before.

00:15:44.386 --> 00:15:46.557
What do you say to them?

00:15:46.557 --> 00:15:48.739
Ethan Nadelmann: Chris, the most
amazing thing that's happened of late

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:50.980
is that I've met a growing number of people

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.558
who have actually 
lost a sibling or a child

00:15:53.558 --> 00:15:55.184
to a drug overdose,

00:15:55.184 --> 00:15:57.160
and 10 years ago, those 
people just wanted to say,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.140
let's line up all the drug 
dealers and shoot them

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.481
and that will solve it.

00:16:00.481 --> 00:16:01.776
And what they've come to understand

00:16:01.776 --> 00:16:04.659
is that the Drug War did 
nothing to protect their kids.

00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:06.108
If anything, it made it more likely

00:16:06.108 --> 00:16:08.210
that those kids were put at risk.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.820
And so they're now becoming part of this

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.695
drug policy reform movement.

00:16:11.695 --> 00:16:13.385
There's other people who have kids,

00:16:13.385 --> 00:16:16.850
one's addicted to alcohol, the other
one's addicted to cocaine or heroin,

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.278
and they ask themselves the question:

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:20.595
Why does this kid get to 
take one step at a time

00:16:20.595 --> 00:16:21.889
and try to get better

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:23.453
and that one's got to deal with jail

00:16:23.453 --> 00:16:25.478
and police and criminals all the time?

00:16:25.478 --> 00:16:26.948
So everybody's understanding,

00:16:26.948 --> 00:16:29.673
the Drug War's not protecting anybody.

00:16:29.673 --> 00:16:31.754
CA: Certainly in the U.S., 
you've got political gridlock

00:16:31.754 --> 00:16:33.149
on most issues.

00:16:33.149 --> 00:16:34.881
Is there any realistic chance of anything

00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:38.227
actually shifting on this 
issue in the next five years?

00:16:38.227 --> 00:16:40.245
EN: I'd say it's quite remarkable. 
I'm getting all these calls

00:16:40.245 --> 00:16:42.126
from journalists now who are saying to me,

00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:44.130
"Ethan, it seems like the only two issues

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.423
advancing politically in America right now

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:49.314
are marijuana law reform and gay marriage.

00:16:49.314 --> 00:16:50.891
What are you doing right?"

00:16:50.891 --> 00:16:53.479
And then you're looking at 
bipartisanship breaking out

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:55.771
with, actually, Republicans in the Congress

00:16:55.771 --> 00:16:58.840
and state legislatures 
allowing bills to be enacted

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.804
with majority Democratic support,

00:17:00.804 --> 00:17:03.320
so we've gone from being sort of the third rail,

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.411
the most fearful issue of American politics,

00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:08.161
to becoming one of the most successful.

00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:10.344
CA: Ethan, thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal.
EN: Chris, thanks so much.

00:17:10.344 --> 00:17:13.264
CA: Thank you.
EN: Thank you. (Applause)
