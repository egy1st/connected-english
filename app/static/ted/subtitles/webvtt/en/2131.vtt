00:00:00.858 --> 00:00:04.677
Vincent Moon: How can we use computers,

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:09.172
cameras, microphones to represent the world

00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:11.336
in an alternative way,

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:13.370
as much as possible?

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.324
How, maybe, is it possible to use the Internet

00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:20.042
to create a new form of cinema?

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:25.035
And actually, why do we record?

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:27.953
Well, it is with such simple questions in mind

00:00:27.953 --> 00:00:31.936
that I started to make films 10 years ago,

00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:35.424
first with a friend, Christophe Abric.

00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:37.809
He had a website, La Blogothèque,

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.475
dedicated to independent music.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:42.130
We were crazy about music.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.822
We wanted to represent 
music in a different way,

00:00:44.822 --> 00:00:47.410
to film the music we love,
the musicians we admired,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.871
as much as possible, far 
from the music industry

00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:53.253
and far from the cliches attached to it.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.219
We started to publish every week

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.969
sessions on the Internet.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.290
We are going to see a few extracts now.

00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:09.744
From Grizzly Bear in the shower

00:01:09.744 --> 00:01:14.940
to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.358
From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower

00:01:21.358 --> 00:01:25.281
to Tom Jones in his 
hotel room in New York.

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:28.707
From Arcade Fire in an elevator

00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:30.856
in the Olympia

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:35.554
to Beirut going down
a staircase in Brooklyn.

00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:40.500
From R.E.M. in a car

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.863
to The National around a table at night

00:01:42.863 --> 00:01:46.620
in the south of France.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.952
From Bon Iver playing with some friends

00:01:49.952 --> 00:01:52.925
in an apartment in Montmartre

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:56.783
to Yeasayer having a long night,

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.866
and many, many, many more

00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:02.370
unknown or very famous bands.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.926
We published all those films

00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:05.882
for free on the Internet,

00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:08.898
and we wanted to share

00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:11.068
all those films and represent music

00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:13.828
in a different way.

00:02:13.828 --> 00:02:16.998
We wanted to create 
another type of intimacy

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:18.662
using all those new technologies.

00:02:18.662 --> 00:02:21.768
At the time, 10 years ago actually,

00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:24.018
there was no such project on the Internet,

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:27.663
and I guess that's why the project we 
were making, the Take Away Shows,

00:02:27.663 --> 00:02:28.940
got quite successful,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.720
reaching millions of viewers.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.920
After a while, I got a bit —

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.830
I wanted to go somewhere else.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.800
I felt the need to travel and
to discover some other music,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.735
to explore the world,

00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:44.523
going to other corners,

00:02:44.523 --> 00:02:46.564
and actually it was also

00:02:46.564 --> 00:02:50.535
this idea of nomadic cinema,
sort of, that I had in mind.

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:57.583
How could the use of new technologies 
and the road fit together?

00:02:57.583 --> 00:02:59.431
How could I edit my films in a bus

00:02:59.431 --> 00:03:01.466
crossing the Andes?

00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:03.400
So I went on five-year travels

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.334
around the globe.

00:03:05.334 --> 00:03:10.310
I started at the time in the digital film 
and music label collection Petites Planètes,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.526
which was also an homage to
French filmmaker Chris Marker.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.371
We're going to see now a few more extracts

00:03:16.371 --> 00:03:19.176
of those new films.

00:03:23.356 --> 00:03:31.320
From the tecno brega diva of
northern Brazil, Gaby Amarantos

00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:35.671
to a female ensemble in Chechnya.

00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:44.315
From experimental electronic music 
in Singapore with One Man Nation

00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:52.322
to Brazilian icon Tom Zé singing
on his rooftop in São Paolo.

00:03:54.672 --> 00:03:59.846
From The Bambir, the great 
rock band from Armenia

00:03:59.846 --> 00:04:02.303
to some traditional songs

00:04:02.303 --> 00:04:06.114
in a restaurant in Tbilisi, Georgia.

00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:14.011
From White Shoes, a great retro 
pop band from Jakarta, Indonesia

00:04:15.012 --> 00:04:21.390
to DakhaBrakha, the revolutionary 
band from Kiev, Ukraine.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.020
From Tomi Lebrero

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.136
and his bandoneon and his friends
in Buenos Aires, Argentina,

00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:30.735
to many other places

00:04:30.735 --> 00:04:33.412
and musicians around the world.

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:36.381
My desire was to make it as a trek.

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:38.147
To do all those films,

00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:39.778
it would have been impossible

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:41.229
with a big company behind me,

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.630
with a structure or anything.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.711
I was traveling alone with a backpack —

00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:48.180
computer, camera, microphones in it.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.965
Alone, actually, but 
just with local people,

00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:53.800
meeting my team, which was absolutely not

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.715
professional people, on the spot there,

00:04:57.715 --> 00:04:59.976
going from one place to another

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:01.457
and to make cinema as a trek.

00:05:01.457 --> 00:05:04.352
I really believed that cinema could be

00:05:04.352 --> 00:05:06.544
this very simple thing:

00:05:06.544 --> 00:05:11.263
I want to make a film and you're going 
to give me a place to stay for the night.

00:05:11.263 --> 00:05:16.195
I give you a moment of cinema
and you offer me a capirinha.

00:05:16.195 --> 00:05:18.480
Well, or other drinks,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.715
depending on where you are.

00:05:20.715 --> 00:05:24.172
In Peru, they drink pisco sour.

00:05:24.172 --> 00:05:29.014
Well, when I arrived in Peru, actually,

00:05:29.014 --> 00:05:34.289
I had no idea about what I would do there.

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:41.569
And I just had one phone number, actually,

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:43.064
of one person.

00:05:43.064 --> 00:05:44.407
Three months later,

00:05:44.407 --> 00:05:48.735
after traveling all around the 
country, I had recorded 33 films,

00:05:48.735 --> 00:05:51.755
only with the help of local people,

00:05:51.755 --> 00:05:54.217
only with the help of people

00:05:54.217 --> 00:05:56.469
that I was asking all the 
time the same question:

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:01.515
What is important to record here today?

00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:03.343
By living in such a way,

00:06:03.343 --> 00:06:06.174
by working without any structure,

00:06:06.174 --> 00:06:11.369
I was able to react to the moment

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:14.787
and to decide, oh, this is 
important to make now.

00:06:14.787 --> 00:06:17.033
This is important to 
record that whole person.

00:06:17.033 --> 00:06:21.049
This is important to create this exchange.

00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:24.100
When I went to Chechnya,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.310
the first person I met

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.520
looked at me and was like,

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.730
"What are you doing here?

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.734
Are you a journalist? NGO? Politics?

00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:36.872
What kind of problems 
are you going to study?"

00:06:36.872 --> 00:06:39.482
Well, I was there to research

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.440
on Sufi rituals in Chechnya, actually —

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.575
incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya,

00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:50.849
which is absolutely unknown 
outside of the region.

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:52.903
As soon as people understood

00:06:52.903 --> 00:06:55.343
that I would give them those films —

00:06:55.343 --> 00:06:57.953
I would publish them online for free
under a Creative Commons license,

00:06:57.953 --> 00:06:59.955
but I would also really 
give them to the people

00:06:59.955 --> 00:07:01.767
and I would let them do 
what they want with it.

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:03.690
I just want to represent 
them in a beautiful light.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.378
I just want to portray them in a way that

00:07:06.378 --> 00:07:09.649
their grandchildren are going
to look at their grandfather,

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:11.204
and they're going to be like,

00:07:11.204 --> 00:07:16.288
"Whoa, my grandfather is as 
cool as Beyoncé." (Laughter)

00:07:16.288 --> 00:07:18.144
It's a really important thing.

00:07:18.144 --> 00:07:21.643
(Applause)

00:07:21.643 --> 00:07:22.948
It's really important,

00:07:22.948 --> 00:07:24.604
because that's the way

00:07:24.604 --> 00:07:28.430
people are going to look differently at 
their own culture, at their own land.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.614
They're going to think about it differently.

00:07:30.614 --> 00:07:35.710
It may be a way to maintain 
a certain diversity.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:40.549
Why you will record?

00:07:40.549 --> 00:07:42.710
Hmm. There's a really good quote

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.634
by American thinker Hakim Bey

00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:48.060
which says, "Every recording

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.966
is a tombstone of a live performance."

00:07:51.966 --> 00:07:54.981
It's a really good 
sentence to keep in mind

00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:58.889
nowadays in an era saturated by images.

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:00.409
What's the point of that?

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:03.189
Where do we go with it?

00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:06.470
I was researching. I was still 
keeping this idea in mind:

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.085
What's the point?

00:08:09.085 --> 00:08:11.305
I was researching on music, trying to pull,

00:08:11.305 --> 00:08:14.173
trying to get closer to a certain origin of it.

00:08:14.173 --> 00:08:16.367
Where is this all coming from?

00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:18.718
I am French. I had no idea about

00:08:18.718 --> 00:08:21.164
what I would discover, 
which is a very simple thing:

00:08:21.164 --> 00:08:23.949
Everything was sacred, at first,

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:27.369
and music was spiritual healing.

00:08:29.472 --> 00:08:32.767
How could I use my camera,

00:08:32.767 --> 00:08:37.255
my little tool, to get closer

00:08:37.255 --> 00:08:39.701
and maybe not only capture the trance

00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:45.595
but find an equivalent, 
a cine-trance, maybe,

00:08:45.595 --> 00:08:48.047
something in complete harmony

00:08:48.047 --> 00:08:50.815
with the people?

00:08:50.815 --> 00:08:55.154
That is now my new research I'm doing

00:08:55.154 --> 00:08:59.575
on spirituality, on new 
spirits around the world.

00:08:59.575 --> 00:09:03.376
Maybe a few more extracts now.

00:09:07.913 --> 00:09:12.689
From the Tana Toraja 
funeral ritual in Indonesia

00:09:17.127 --> 00:09:20.645
to an Easter ceremony 
in the north of Ethiopia.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:26.198
From jathilan, a popular trance ritual

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:29.299
on the island of Java,

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:35.722
to Umbanda in the north of Brazil.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.357
The Sufi rituals of Chechnya

00:09:45.386 --> 00:09:50.669
to a mass in the holiest 
church of Armenia.

00:09:54.846 --> 00:09:56.691
Some Sufi songs in Harar,

00:09:56.691 --> 00:10:00.377
the holy city of Ethiopia,

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.281
to an ayahuasca ceremony

00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:08.404
deep in the Amazon of 
Peru with the Shipibo.

00:10:11.996 --> 00:10:14.162
Then to my new project, 
the one I'm doing now

00:10:14.162 --> 00:10:15.798
here in Brazil, named "Híbridos."

00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:17.584
I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon.

00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:22.547
It's research on the new 
spiritualities all around the country.

00:10:22.547 --> 00:10:28.505
This is my quest, my own little quest 
of what I call experimental ethnography,

00:10:28.505 --> 00:10:36.773
trying to hybrid all 
those different genres,

00:10:36.773 --> 00:10:40.060
trying to regain a certain complexity.

00:10:41.485 --> 00:10:44.000
Why do we record?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.681
I was still there.

00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:50.494
I really believe cinema teaches us to see.

00:10:50.494 --> 00:10:51.900
The way we show the world

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.150
is going to change the 
way we see this world,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.290
and we live in a moment where the mass media

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.899
are doing a terrible, terrible job

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:03.126
at representing the world:

00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:07.160
violence, extremists,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.314
only spectacular events,

00:11:09.314 --> 00:11:11.541
only simplifications of everyday life.

00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:13.666
I think we are recording

00:11:13.666 --> 00:11:17.252
to regain a certain complexity.

00:11:17.252 --> 00:11:22.423
To reinvent life today,

00:11:22.423 --> 00:11:26.213
we have to make new forms of images.

00:11:26.213 --> 00:11:28.377
And it's very simple.

00:11:28.377 --> 00:11:31.060
Muito obrigado.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.158
(Applause)

00:11:42.204 --> 00:11:45.263
Bruno Giussani: Vincent, Vincent, Vincent.

00:11:45.263 --> 00:11:48.301
Merci. We have to prepare for
the following performance,

00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:50.888
and I have a question for you,
and the question is this:

00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:54.914
You show up in places like the 
ones you just have shown us,

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:56.818
and you are carrying a camera

00:11:56.818 --> 00:11:59.313
and I assume that you are welcome

00:11:59.313 --> 00:12:02.000
but you are not always absolutely welcome.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.634
You walk into sacred rituals,

00:12:04.634 --> 00:12:08.471
private moments in a village, a town,

00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:10.680
a group of people.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.576
How do you break the barrier

00:12:12.576 --> 00:12:14.859
when you show up with a lens?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.605
VM: I think you break it with your body,

00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:23.243
more than with your knowledge.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.610
That's what it taught me to travel,

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.433
to trust the memory of the body

00:12:28.433 --> 00:12:31.083
more than the memory of the brain.

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:33.395
The respect is stepping forward,

00:12:33.395 --> 00:12:36.240
not stepping backward, and I really think that

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.190
by engaging your body in the
moment, in the ceremony,

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.553
in the places, people welcome you

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.237
and understand your energy.

00:12:43.237 --> 00:12:44.900
BG: You told me that most of the videos

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.569
you have made are 
actually one single shot.

00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:49.177
You don't do much editing.

00:12:49.177 --> 00:12:50.921
I mean, you edited the ones for us

00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:53.486
at the beginning of the sessions
because of the length, etc.

00:12:53.486 --> 00:12:55.313
Otherwise, you just go in and capture

00:12:55.313 --> 00:12:57.119
whatever happens in front of your eyes

00:12:57.119 --> 00:12:59.853
without much planning, and so is that the case?

00:12:59.853 --> 00:13:01.586
It's correct?

00:13:01.586 --> 00:13:03.594
VM: My idea is that I think that

00:13:03.594 --> 00:13:07.614
as long as we don't cut, in a way,

00:13:07.614 --> 00:13:10.719
as long as we let the viewer watch,

00:13:10.719 --> 00:13:13.688
more and more viewers 
are going to feel closer,

00:13:13.688 --> 00:13:16.501
are going to get closer to the moment,

00:13:16.501 --> 00:13:20.337
to that moment and to that place.

00:13:20.337 --> 00:13:23.869
I really think of that as a matter 
of respecting the viewer,

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:27.581
to not cut all the time from one place to another,

00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:29.645
to just let the time go.

00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:31.749
BG: Tell me in a few words 
about your new project,

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:33.284
"Híbridos," here in Brazil.

00:13:33.284 --> 00:13:35.062
Just before coming to 
TEDGlobal, you have actually

00:13:35.062 --> 00:13:37.333
been traveling around 
the country for that.

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:39.156
Tell us a couple of things.

00:13:39.156 --> 00:13:41.485
VM: "Híbridos" is — 
I really believe Brazil,

00:13:41.485 --> 00:13:45.658
far from the cliches, is the greatest
religious country in the world,

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.504
the greatest country 
in terms of spirituality

00:13:48.504 --> 00:13:51.541
and in experimentations in spiritualities.

00:13:51.541 --> 00:13:54.515
And it's a big project I'm 
doing over this year,

00:13:54.515 --> 00:13:59.315
which is researching in very
different regions of Brazil,

00:13:59.315 --> 00:14:01.420
in very different forms of cults,

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.308
and trying to understand 
how people live together

00:14:03.308 --> 00:14:04.753
with spirituality nowadays.

00:14:04.753 --> 00:14:08.489
BG: The man who is going to 
appear onstage momentarily,

00:14:08.489 --> 00:14:10.199
and Vincent's going to introduce him,

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:13.851
is one of the subjects of 
one of his past videos.

00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:15.718
When did you do a video with him?

00:14:15.718 --> 00:14:18.272
VM: I guess four years ago,

00:14:18.272 --> 00:14:20.758
four years in my first travel.

00:14:20.758 --> 00:14:23.602
BG: So it was one of 
your first ones in Brazil.

00:14:23.602 --> 00:14:25.833
VM: It was amongst the 
first ones in Brazil, yeah.

00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:27.290
I shot the film in Recife,

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.259
in the place where he is from.

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:32.269
BG: So let's introduce him. 
Who are we waiting for?

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:33.740
VM: I'll just make it very short.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.343
It's a very great honor for 
me to welcome onstage

00:14:36.343 --> 00:14:39.304
one of the greatest Brazilian 
musicians of all time.

00:14:39.304 --> 00:14:41.643
Please welcome Naná Vasconcelos.

00:14:41.643 --> 00:14:43.555
BG: Naná Vasconcelos!

00:14:43.555 --> 00:14:47.961
(Applause)

00:14:50.563 --> 00:14:57.309
(Music)

00:19:07.657 --> 00:19:11.815
Naná Vasconcelos: Let's go to the jungle.

00:23:47.636 --> 00:23:51.636
(Applause)
