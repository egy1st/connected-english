00:00:00.602 --> 00:00:04.160
The first patient to ever be 
treated with an antibiotic

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.693
was a policeman in Oxford.

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:07.800
On his day off from work,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.173
he was scratched by a rose thorn
while working in the garden.

00:00:11.173 --> 00:00:14.848
That small scratch became infected.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.163
Over the next few days, 
his head was swollen

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:18.884
with abscesses,

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:21.167
and in fact his eye was so infected

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:23.070
that they had to take it out,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.050
and by February of 1941,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.487
this poor man was on the verge of dying.

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:31.685
He was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford,

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:33.991
and fortunately for him,

00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:35.041
a small team of doctors

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:36.930
led by a Dr. Howard Florey

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.997
had managed to synthesize

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.820
a very small amount of penicillin,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.901
a drug that had been discovered

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:46.223
12 years before by Alexander Fleming

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:49.930
but had never actually been 
used to treat a human,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.340
and indeed no one even 
knew if the drug would work,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.980
if it was full of impurities 
that would kill the patient,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.894
but Florey and his team figured

00:00:57.894 --> 00:00:59.616
if they had to use it, 
they might as well use it

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:02.181
on someone who was going to die anyway.

00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:05.836
So they gave Albert Alexander,

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.715
this Oxford policeman, the drug,

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:11.132
and within 24 hours,

00:01:11.132 --> 00:01:13.394
he started getting better.

00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:17.370
His fever went down, 
his appetite came back.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.683
Second day, he was doing much better.

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:21.921
They were starting to 
run out of penicillin,

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:23.983
so what they would do 
was run with his urine

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.833
across the road to re-synthesize 
the penicillin from his urine

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:28.768
and give it back to him,

00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:30.016
and that worked.

00:01:30.016 --> 00:01:32.496
Day four, well on the way to recovery.

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:34.134
This was a miracle.

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:38.370
Day five, they ran out of penicillin,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.637
and the poor man died.

00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:43.350
So that story didn't end that well,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.700
but fortunately for 
millions of other people,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.706
like this child who was treated 
again in the early 1940s,

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:53.740
who was again dying of a sepsis,

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.890
and within just six days, you can see,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.243
recovered thanks to this 
wonder drug, penicillin.

00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:02.201
Millions have lived,

00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:05.785
and global health has been transformed.

00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:08.578
Now, antibiotics have been used

00:02:08.578 --> 00:02:11.705
for patients like this,

00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:13.842
but they've also been 
used rather frivolously

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.586
in some instances,

00:02:15.586 --> 00:02:17.949
for treating someone 
with just a cold or the flu,

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.423
which they might not have 
responded to an antibiotic,

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:24.161
and they've also been 
used in large quantities

00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:27.803
sub-therapeutically, which
means in small concentrations,

00:02:27.803 --> 00:02:30.986
to make chicken and hogs grow faster.

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:34.552
Just to save a few pennies
on the price of meat,

00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:37.252
we've spent a lot of 
antibiotics on animals,

00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:39.614
not for treatment, not for sick animals,

00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:42.730
but primarily for growth promotion.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.587
Now, what did that lead us to?

00:02:45.587 --> 00:02:48.298
Basically, the massive use of antibiotics

00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:49.783
around the world

00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:53.587
has imposed such large
selection pressure on bacteria

00:02:53.587 --> 00:02:56.240
that resistance is now a problem,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.010
because we've now selected for just

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.985
the resistant bacteria.

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:02.825
And I'm sure you've all read
about this in the newspapers,

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:04.629
you've seen this in every magazine

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.528
that you come across,

00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:08.328
but I really want you to appreciate

00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:10.499
the significance of this problem.

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:11.950
This is serious.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.766
The next slide I'm about to show you is 
of carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter.

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:19.154
Acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug,

00:03:19.154 --> 00:03:20.487
and carbapenem is pretty much

00:03:20.487 --> 00:03:22.265
the strongest class of antibiotics

00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:24.721
that we can throw at this bug.

00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:27.990
And you can see in 1999

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.185
this is the pattern of resistance,

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:33.218
mostly under about 10 percent
across the United States.

00:03:33.218 --> 00:03:37.215
Now watch what happens 
when we play the video.

00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:48.516
So I don't know where you live,

00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:51.418
but wherever it is, it certainly is a lot worse now

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:53.915
than it was in 1999,

00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:57.886
and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance.

00:03:57.886 --> 00:03:59.573
It's a global issue

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:02.001
affecting both rich and poor countries,

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.242
and at the heart of it, 
you might say, well,

00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:06.170
isn't this really just a medical issue?

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.731
If we taught doctors how not 
to use antibiotics as much,

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:11.676
if we taught patients how 
not to demand antibiotics,

00:04:11.676 --> 00:04:13.131
perhaps this really wouldn't be an issue,

00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:15.120
and maybe the pharmaceutical companies

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.875
should be working harder to develop

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.511
more antibiotics.

00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:21.890
Now, it turns out that there's something 
fundamental about antibiotics

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.673
which makes it different from other drugs,

00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:25.694
which is that if I misuse antibiotics

00:04:25.694 --> 00:04:27.431
or I use antibiotics,

00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.291
not only am I affected but 
others are affected as well,

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:33.629
in the same way as if I 
choose to drive to work

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.268
or take a plane to go somewhere,

00:04:36.268 --> 00:04:38.242
that the costs I impose on others

00:04:38.242 --> 00:04:40.682
through global climate change go everywhere,

00:04:40.682 --> 00:04:43.455
and I don't necessarily take
these costs into consideration.

00:04:43.455 --> 00:04:46.334
This is what economists might 
call a problem of the commons,

00:04:46.334 --> 00:04:48.314
and the problem of the commons is exactly

00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:50.739
what we face in the case 
of antibiotics as well:

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:52.889
that we don't consider —

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.891
and we, including individuals, patients,

00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:59.050
hospitals, entire health systems —

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.198
do not consider the costs 
that they impose on others

00:05:01.198 --> 00:05:03.554
by the way antibiotics are actually used.

00:05:03.554 --> 00:05:05.959
Now, that's a problem that's similar

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:07.941
to another area that we all know about,

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:09.870
which is of fuel use and energy,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.369
and of course energy use

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:14.451
both depletes energy as well as

00:05:14.451 --> 00:05:17.713
leads to local pollution 
and climate change.

00:05:17.713 --> 00:05:19.523
And typically, in the case of energy,

00:05:19.523 --> 00:05:21.831
there are two ways in which
you can deal with the problem.

00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:25.576
One is, we can make better
use of the oil that we have,

00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:27.691
and that's analogous to making better use

00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:29.239
of existing antibiotics,

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:30.930
and we can do this in a number of ways

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.160
that we'll talk about in a second,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.847
but the other option is the 
"drill, baby, drill" option,

00:05:36.847 --> 00:05:41.038
which in the case of antibiotics 
is to go find new antibiotics.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.100
Now, these are not separate.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.522
They're related, because if we invest heavily

00:05:46.522 --> 00:05:48.806
in new oil wells,

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:51.760
we reduce the incentives 
for conservation of oil

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.286
in the same way that's going 
to happen for antibiotics.

00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:56.454
The reverse is also going 
to happen, which is that

00:05:56.454 --> 00:05:58.792
if we use our antibiotics appropriately,

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:01.573
we don't necessarily have 
to make the investments

00:06:01.573 --> 00:06:03.750
in new drug development.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.466
And if you thought that these two were entirely,

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.288
fully balanced between these two options,

00:06:08.288 --> 00:06:10.471
you might consider the fact that

00:06:10.471 --> 00:06:12.743
this is really a game that we're playing.

00:06:12.743 --> 00:06:15.184
The game is really one of coevolution,

00:06:15.184 --> 00:06:18.116
and coevolution is, in 
this particular picture,

00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:20.472
between cheetahs and gazelles.

00:06:20.472 --> 00:06:22.090
Cheetahs have evolved to run faster,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.667
because if they didn't run faster,

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:25.613
they wouldn't get any lunch.

00:06:25.613 --> 00:06:28.300
Gazelles have evolved to run faster because

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.509
if they don't run faster, they would be lunch.

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.395
Now, this is the game we're
playing against the bacteria,

00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:36.452
except we're not the cheetahs,

00:06:36.452 --> 00:06:37.929
we're the gazelles,

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:40.716
and the bacteria would,

00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:42.549
just in the course of this little talk,

00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:43.975
would have had kids and grandkids

00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:46.360
and figured out how to be resistant

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.834
just by selection and trial and error,

00:06:48.834 --> 00:06:50.746
trying it over and over again.

00:06:50.746 --> 00:06:54.518
Whereas how do we stay 
ahead of the bacteria?

00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:56.572
We have drug discovery processes,

00:06:56.572 --> 00:06:58.202
screening molecules,

00:06:58.202 --> 00:06:59.930
we have clinical trials,

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.078
and then, when we think we have a drug,

00:07:02.078 --> 00:07:05.823
then we have the FDA regulatory process.

00:07:05.823 --> 00:07:08.001
And once we go through all of that,

00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:10.266
then we try to stay one step ahead

00:07:10.266 --> 00:07:12.562
of the bacteria.

00:07:12.562 --> 00:07:15.339
Now, this is clearly not a 
game that can be sustained,

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:16.476
or one that we can win

00:07:16.476 --> 00:07:18.313
by simply innovating to stay ahead.

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:21.618
We've got to slow the pace of coevolution down,

00:07:21.618 --> 00:07:25.300
and there are ideas that we 
can borrow from energy

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.070
that are helpful in thinking about

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.607
how we might want to do this in the case

00:07:28.607 --> 00:07:30.153
of antibiotics as well.

00:07:30.153 --> 00:07:32.393
Now, if you think about how we deal with

00:07:32.393 --> 00:07:33.816
energy pricing, for instance,

00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:35.665
we consider emissions taxes,

00:07:35.665 --> 00:07:38.249
which means we're imposing 
the costs of pollution

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.080
on people who actually use that energy.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.060
We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.771
and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics

00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:49.172
actually get used appropriately.

00:07:49.172 --> 00:07:51.200
There are clean energy subsidies,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.255
which are to switch to fuels
which don't pollute as much

00:07:54.255 --> 00:07:57.100
or perhaps don't need fossil fuels.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.960
Now, the analogy here is, perhaps we need

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.220
to move away from using antibiotics,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.936
and if you think about it, what are 
good substitutes for antibiotics?

00:08:05.936 --> 00:08:08.100
Well, turns out that anything that reduces

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.343
the need for the antibiotic would really work,

00:08:10.343 --> 00:08:13.485
so that could include improving
hospital infection control

00:08:13.485 --> 00:08:16.380
or vaccinating people,

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.677
particularly against 
the seasonal influenza.

00:08:18.677 --> 00:08:21.208
And the seasonal flu is probably

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:24.212
the biggest driver of antibiotic use,

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.131
both in this country as well
as in many other countries,

00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:29.151
and that could really help.

00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:33.254
A third option might include
something like tradeable permits.

00:08:33.254 --> 00:08:37.500
And these seem like faraway scenarios,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.927
but if you consider the 
fact that we might not

00:08:39.927 --> 00:08:43.310
have antibiotics for many 
people who have infections,

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.547
we might consider the fact that we might

00:08:45.547 --> 00:08:47.858
want to allocate who actually gets to use

00:08:47.858 --> 00:08:50.572
some of these antibiotics over others,

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:53.898
and some of these might have to
be on the basis of clinical need,

00:08:53.898 --> 00:08:55.833
but also on the basis of pricing.

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:57.743
And certainly consumer education works.

00:08:57.743 --> 00:09:00.344
Very often, people overuse antibiotics

00:09:00.344 --> 00:09:02.621
or prescribe too much without necessarily

00:09:02.621 --> 00:09:04.227
knowing that they do so,

00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:05.658
and feedback mechanisms

00:09:05.658 --> 00:09:07.560
have been found to be useful,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.489
both on energy —

00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:11.029
When you tell someone that they're using

00:09:11.029 --> 00:09:12.946
a lot of energy during peak hour,

00:09:12.946 --> 00:09:14.416
they tend to cut back,

00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:16.183
and the same sort of example has been performed

00:09:16.183 --> 00:09:17.993
even in the case of antibiotics.

00:09:17.993 --> 00:09:19.974
A hospital in St. Louis basically would put up

00:09:19.974 --> 00:09:24.166
on a chart the names of surgeons

00:09:24.166 --> 00:09:26.385
in the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used

00:09:26.385 --> 00:09:28.329
in the previous month,

00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:30.671
and this was purely an 
informational feedback,

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:31.854
there was no shaming,

00:09:31.854 --> 00:09:33.989
but essentially that provided 
some information back

00:09:33.989 --> 00:09:35.943
to surgeons that maybe they could rethink

00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:38.172
how they were using antibiotics.

00:09:38.172 --> 00:09:40.186
Now, there's a lot that can be done

00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:42.335
on the supply side as well.

00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:44.112
If you look at the price of penicillin,

00:09:44.112 --> 00:09:45.763
the cost per day is about 10 cents.

00:09:45.763 --> 00:09:47.521
It's a fairly cheap drug.

00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:49.658
If you take drugs that have
been introduced since then —

00:09:49.658 --> 00:09:52.302
linezolid or daptomycin —

00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:54.180
those are significantly more expensive,

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.631
so to a world that has been used to
paying 10 cents a day for antibiotics,

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:02.163
the idea of paying 180 dollars per day

00:10:02.163 --> 00:10:03.730
seems like a lot.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.717
But what is that really telling us?

00:10:05.717 --> 00:10:07.682
That price is telling us

00:10:07.682 --> 00:10:09.580
that we should no longer

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.697
take cheap, effective 
antibiotics as a given

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:15.464
into the foreseeable future,

00:10:15.464 --> 00:10:17.994
and that price is a signal to us

00:10:17.994 --> 00:10:19.603
that perhaps we need to be paying

00:10:19.603 --> 00:10:22.156
much more attention to conservation.

00:10:22.156 --> 00:10:24.860
That price is also a signal

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.735
that maybe we need to start
looking at other technologies,

00:10:27.735 --> 00:10:30.387
in the same way that 
gasoline prices are a signal

00:10:30.387 --> 00:10:32.977
and an impetus, to, say,

00:10:32.977 --> 00:10:34.845
the development of electric cars.

00:10:34.845 --> 00:10:36.622
Prices are important signals

00:10:36.622 --> 00:10:38.208
and we need to pay attention,

00:10:38.208 --> 00:10:40.660
but we also need to consider the fact that

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.912
although these high prices
seem unusual for antibiotics,

00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:47.151
they're nothing compared to the price per day

00:10:47.151 --> 00:10:48.535
of some cancer drugs,

00:10:48.535 --> 00:10:51.905
which might save a patient's life only
for a few months or perhaps a year,

00:10:51.905 --> 00:10:53.675
whereas antibiotics would potentially

00:10:53.675 --> 00:10:55.501
save a patient's life forever.

00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:56.820
So this is going to involve

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.782
a whole new paradigm shift,

00:10:58.782 --> 00:11:00.638
and it's also a scary shift because

00:11:00.638 --> 00:11:02.967
in many parts of this country,

00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:04.711
in many parts of the world,

00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:06.780
the idea of paying 200 dollars

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.671
for a day of antibiotic treatment

00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:12.213
is simply unimaginable.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.947
So we need to think about that.

00:11:13.947 --> 00:11:15.760
Now, there are backstop options,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.436
which is other alternative technologies

00:11:18.436 --> 00:11:19.630
that people are working on.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.282
It includes bacteriophages, probiotics,

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:26.330
quorum sensing, synbiotics.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.369
Now, all of these are useful avenues to pursue,

00:11:29.369 --> 00:11:31.979
and they will become even more lucrative

00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:35.060
when the price of new 
antibiotics starts going higher,

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.957
and we've seen that the
market does actually respond,

00:11:37.957 --> 00:11:39.965
and the government is now considering

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:43.732
ways of subsidizing new 
antibiotics and development.

00:11:43.732 --> 00:11:45.455
But there are challenges here.

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.030
We don't want to just throw money at a problem.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.549
What we want to be able to do

00:11:48.549 --> 00:11:50.828
is invest in new antibiotics

00:11:50.828 --> 00:11:53.804
in ways that actually encourage

00:11:53.804 --> 00:11:56.824
appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics,

00:11:56.824 --> 00:11:59.287
and that really is the challenge here.

00:11:59.287 --> 00:12:01.616
Now, going back to these technologies,

00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:03.979
you all remember the line from that famous

00:12:03.979 --> 00:12:06.205
dinosaur film, "Nature will find a way."

00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:09.524
So it's not as if these are 
permanent solutions.

00:12:09.524 --> 00:12:13.610
We really have to remember that,
whatever the technology might be,

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.486
that nature will find some 
way to work around it.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.557
You might think, well, 
this is just a problem

00:12:18.557 --> 00:12:21.301
just with antibiotics and with bacteria,

00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:23.247
but it turns out that we 
have the exact same

00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:25.981
identical problem in 
many other fields as well,

00:12:25.981 --> 00:12:28.933
with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,

00:12:28.933 --> 00:12:32.495
which is a serious problem 
in India and South Africa.

00:12:32.495 --> 00:12:34.282
Thousands of patients are dying because

00:12:34.282 --> 00:12:36.116
the second-line drugs are so expensive,

00:12:36.116 --> 00:12:38.343
and in some instances, even those don't work

00:12:38.343 --> 00:12:40.413
and you have XDR TB.

00:12:40.413 --> 00:12:42.224
Viruses are becoming resistant.

00:12:42.224 --> 00:12:45.390
Agricultural pests. Malaria parasites.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.173
Right now, much of the world depends on

00:12:47.173 --> 00:12:50.870
one drug, artemisinin drugs,

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.826
essentially to treat malaria.

00:12:52.826 --> 00:12:55.413
Resistance to artemisinin has already emerged,

00:12:55.413 --> 00:12:57.767
and if this were to become widespread,

00:12:57.767 --> 00:12:59.115
that puts at risk

00:12:59.115 --> 00:13:02.006
the single drug that we have to 
treat malaria around the world

00:13:02.006 --> 00:13:05.220
in a way that's currently 
safe and efficacious.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.018
Mosquitos develop resistance.

00:13:07.018 --> 00:13:09.255
If you have kids, you probably 
know about head lice,

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:10.968
and if you're from New York City,

00:13:10.968 --> 00:13:13.701
I understand that the 
specialty there is bedbugs.

00:13:13.701 --> 00:13:15.956
So those are also resistant.

00:13:15.956 --> 00:13:18.835
And we have to bring an
example from across the pond.

00:13:18.835 --> 00:13:21.190
Turns out that rats are 
also resistant to poisons.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.891
Now, what's common 
to all of these things is

00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:26.597
the idea that we've had these technologies

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:31.218
to control nature only for 
the last 70, 80 or 100 years

00:13:31.218 --> 00:13:34.246
and essentially in a blink,

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.797
we have squandered our ability to control,

00:13:36.797 --> 00:13:39.288
because we have not recognized

00:13:39.288 --> 00:13:42.100
that natural selection and 
evolution was going to find

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.274
a way to get back,

00:13:43.274 --> 00:13:45.323
and we need to completely rethink

00:13:45.323 --> 00:13:47.666
how we're going to use

00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:50.760
measures to control biological organisms,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.224
and rethink how we incentivize

00:13:54.224 --> 00:13:56.450
the development, introduction,

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.118
in the case of antibiotics prescription,

00:13:59.118 --> 00:14:02.890
and use of these valuable resources.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.270
And we really now need to 
start thinking about them

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.228
as natural resources.

00:14:07.228 --> 00:14:09.466
And so we stand at a crossroads.

00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:12.625
An option is to go through that rethinking

00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:14.438
and carefully consider incentives

00:14:14.438 --> 00:14:16.992
to change how we do business.

00:14:16.992 --> 00:14:19.253
The alternative is

00:14:19.253 --> 00:14:22.336
a world in which even a blade of grass

00:14:22.336 --> 00:14:24.765
is a potentially lethal weapon.

00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:26.565
Thank you.

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:29.300
(Applause)
