WEBVTT

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.770
They told me that I'm a traitor
to my own profession,

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.322
that I should be fired,

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:09.961
have my medical license taken away,

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:13.443
that I should go back to my own country.

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:16.018
My email got hacked.

00:00:16.018 --> 00:00:19.160
In a discussion forum for other doctors,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.521
someone took credit
for "Twitter-bombing" my account.

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.044
Now, I didn't know if this
was a good or bad thing,

00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:28.331
but then came the response:

00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:30.644
"Too bad it wasn't a real bomb."

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.600
I never thought that I would do something

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.369
that would provoke this level of anger
among other doctors.

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:40.574
Becoming a doctor was my dream.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:41.855
I grew up in China,

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.243
and my earliest memories
are of being rushed to the hospital

00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:48.588
because I had such bad asthma
that I was there nearly every week.

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:52.517
I had this one doctor, Dr. Sam,
who always took care of me.

00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:54.556
She was about the same age as my mother.

00:00:54.556 --> 00:00:56.626
She had this wild, curly hair,

00:00:56.626 --> 00:01:00.027
and she always wore
these bright yellow flowery dresses.

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:01.991
She was one of those doctors who,

00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:04.110
if you fell and you broke your arm,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.427
she would ask you why you weren't laughing

00:01:06.427 --> 00:01:08.665
because it's your humerus. Get it?

00:01:10.312 --> 00:01:12.054
See, you'd groan,

00:01:12.054 --> 00:01:15.546
but she'd always make you feel better
after having seen her.

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:17.556
Well, we all have that childhood hero

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:20.188
that we want to grow up
to be just like, right?

00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:22.224
Well, I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam.

00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:27.404
When I was eight,
my parents and I moved to the U.S.,

00:01:27.404 --> 00:01:29.668
and ours became
the typical immigrant narrative.

00:01:29.668 --> 00:01:34.186
My parents cleaned hotel rooms
and washed dishes and pumped gas

00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:36.043
so that I could pursue my dream.

00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:39.495
Well, eventually I learned enough English,

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:41.026
and my parents were so happy

00:01:41.026 --> 00:01:45.085
the day that I got into medical school
and took my oath of healing and service.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.504
But then one day, everything changed.

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:52.305
My mother called me to tell me
that she wasn't feeling well,

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:55.735
she had a cough that wouldn't go away,
she was short of breath and tired.

00:01:55.836 --> 00:01:59.416
Well, I knew that my mother was someone
who never complained about anything.

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:01.959
For her to tell me
that something was the matter,

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:04.359
I knew something had to be really wrong.

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:05.678
And it was:

00:02:05.678 --> 00:02:08.835
We found out that she had
stage IV breast cancer,

00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:12.775
cancer that by then had spread
to her lungs, her bones, and her brain.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.214
My mother was brave,
though, and she had hope.

00:02:16.214 --> 00:02:18.195
She went through surgery and radiation,

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:20.574
and was on her third round of chemotherapy

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:22.761
when she lost her address book.

00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:25.860
She tried to look up her oncologist's
phone number on the Internet

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.433
and she found it,
but she found something else too.

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:29.913
On several websites,

00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:33.493
he was listed as a highly paid
speaker to a drug company,

00:02:33.493 --> 00:02:35.417
and in fact often spoke on behalf

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:38.973
of the same chemo regimen
that he had prescribed her.

00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:40.570
She called me in a panic,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.288
and I didn't know what to believe.

00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:44.541
Maybe this was the right
chemo regimen for her,

00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:46.822
but maybe it wasn't.

00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:49.972
It made her scared and it made her doubt.

00:02:49.972 --> 00:02:51.682
When it comes to medicine,

00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:54.292
having that trust is a must,

00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:58.391
and when that trust is gone,
then all that's left is fear.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.817
There's another side to this fear.

00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:05.000
As a medical student, I was taking care
of this 19-year-old

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.499
who was biking back to his dorm

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.638
when he got struck and hit,

00:03:08.638 --> 00:03:11.166
run over by an SUV.

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:12.852
He had seven broken ribs,

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:14.225
shattered hip bones,

00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:17.424
and he was bleeding inside
his belly and inside his brain.

00:03:17.424 --> 00:03:19.208
Now, imagine being his parents

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:21.368
who flew in from Seattle,
2,000 miles away,

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.764
to find their son in a coma.

00:03:23.764 --> 00:03:26.770
I mean, you'd want to find out
what's going on with him, right?

00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:28.689
They asked to attend our bedside rounds

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.891
where we discussed
his condition and his plan,

00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:32.888
which I thought was a reasonable request,

00:03:32.888 --> 00:03:34.938
and also would give us
a chance to show them

00:03:34.938 --> 00:03:37.128
how much we were trying
and how much we cared.

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.290
The head doctor, though, said no.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.932
He gave all kinds of reasons.

00:03:41.932 --> 00:03:43.814
Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way.

00:03:43.814 --> 00:03:47.950
Maybe they'll stop students
from asking questions.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.387
He even said,

00:03:49.387 --> 00:03:52.593
"What if they see mistakes and sue us?"

00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:56.777
What I saw behind every excuse
was deep fear,

00:03:56.777 --> 00:03:59.499
and what I learned
was that to become a doctor,

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.340
we have to put on our white coats,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.534
put up a wall, and hide behind it.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.367
There's a hidden epidemic in medicine.

00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:11.182
Of course, patients are scared
when they come to the doctor.

00:04:11.182 --> 00:04:13.556
Imagine you wake up
with this terrible bellyache,

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:14.742
you go to the hospital,

00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:17.993
you're lying in this strange place,
you're on this hospital gurney,

00:04:17.994 --> 00:04:19.550
you're wearing this flimsy gown,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.709
strangers are coming
to poke and prod at you.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.553
You don't know what's going to happen.

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:27.532
You don't even know if you're going to get
the blanket you asked for 30 minutes ago.

00:04:27.532 --> 00:04:29.793
But it's not just patients who are scared;

00:04:29.793 --> 00:04:31.660
doctors are scared too.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.526
We're scared of patients
finding out who we are

00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:36.656
and what medicine is all about.

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:38.247
And so what do we do?

00:04:38.247 --> 00:04:41.253
We put on our white coats
and we hide behind them.

00:04:41.253 --> 00:04:42.962
Of course, the more we hide,

00:04:42.962 --> 00:04:45.761
the more people want to know
what it is that we're hiding.

00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:49.213
The more fear then spirals
into mistrust and poor medical care.

00:04:49.213 --> 00:04:51.489
We don't just have a fear of sickness,

00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:53.723
we have a sickness of fear.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.316
Can we bridge this disconnect

00:04:57.316 --> 00:05:01.135
between what patients need
and what doctors do?

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:03.051
Can we overcome the sickness of fear?

00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:05.280
Let me ask you differently:

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.103
If hiding isn't the answer,
what if we did the opposite?

00:05:09.103 --> 00:05:13.142
What if doctors were to become
totally transparent with their patients?

00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:17.272
Last fall, I conducted
a research study to find out

00:05:17.272 --> 00:05:20.125
what it is that people want
to know about their healthcare.

00:05:20.128 --> 00:05:22.513
I didn't just want to study
patients in a hospital,

00:05:22.514 --> 00:05:23.964
but everyday people.

00:05:23.965 --> 00:05:27.137
So my two medical students,
Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns,

00:05:27.137 --> 00:05:29.532
literally took their research
to the streets.

00:05:29.532 --> 00:05:33.271
They went to banks,
coffee shops, senior centers,

00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:35.703
Chinese restaurants and train stations.

00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:38.593
What did they find?

00:05:38.593 --> 00:05:39.962
Well, when we asked people,

00:05:39.962 --> 00:05:42.388
"What do you want to know
about your healthcare?"

00:05:42.388 --> 00:05:46.086
people responded with what they want
to know about their doctors,

00:05:46.086 --> 00:05:47.883
because people understand health care

00:05:47.883 --> 00:05:51.863
to be the individual interaction
between them and their doctors.

00:05:51.864 --> 00:05:54.787
When we asked, "What do you
want to know about your doctors?"

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:56.515
people gave three different answers.

00:05:56.515 --> 00:05:59.308
Some want to know
that their doctor is competent

00:05:59.308 --> 00:06:01.614
and certified to practice medicine.

00:06:01.614 --> 00:06:03.954
Some want to be sure
that their doctor is unbiased

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.402
and is making decisions
based on evidence and science,

00:06:07.418 --> 00:06:08.679
not on who pays them.

00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:11.104
Surprisingly to us,

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:14.618
many people want to know
something else about their doctors.

00:06:14.618 --> 00:06:17.250
Jonathan, a 28-year-old law student,

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:22.026
says he wants to find someone
who is comfortable with LGBTQ patients

00:06:22.026 --> 00:06:24.659
and specializes in LGBT health.

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:26.401
Serena, a 32-year-old accountant,

00:06:26.401 --> 00:06:29.666
says that it's important to her
for her doctor to share her values

00:06:29.726 --> 00:06:32.694
when it comes to reproductive choice
and women's rights.

00:06:33.634 --> 00:06:35.815
Frank, a 59-year-old
hardware store owner,

00:06:35.815 --> 00:06:38.155
doesn't even like going to the doctor

00:06:38.155 --> 00:06:41.699
and wants to find someone
who believes in prevention first,

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.803
but who is comfortable
with alternative treatments.

00:06:44.803 --> 00:06:47.143
One after another,
our respondents told us

00:06:47.143 --> 00:06:50.621
that that doctor-patient relationship
is a deeply intimate one —

00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:52.587
that to show their doctors their bodies

00:06:52.587 --> 00:06:54.555
and tell them their deepest secrets,

00:06:54.555 --> 00:06:57.627
they want to first understand
their doctor's values.

00:06:57.627 --> 00:07:00.585
Just because doctors
have to see every patient

00:07:00.585 --> 00:07:03.170
doesn't mean that patients
have to see every doctor.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.388
People want to know
about their doctors first

00:07:05.388 --> 00:07:07.344
so that they can make an informed choice.

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:10.968
As a result of this, I formed a campaign,

00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:12.442
Who's My Doctor?

00:07:12.442 --> 00:07:15.302
that calls for total
transparency in medicine.

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:17.534
Participating doctors voluntarily disclose

00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:18.927
on a public website

00:07:18.927 --> 00:07:21.683
not just information
about where we went to medical school

00:07:21.683 --> 00:07:23.029
and what specialty we're in,

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:24.982
but also our conflicts of interest.

00:07:24.982 --> 00:07:27.446
We go beyond
the Government in the Sunshine Act

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:29.883
about drug company affiliations,

00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:32.887
and we talk about how we're paid.

00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:34.431
Incentives matter.

00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:36.618
If you go to your doctor
because of back pain,

00:07:36.618 --> 00:07:40.447
you might want to know he's getting paid
5,000 dollars to perform spine surgery

00:07:40.447 --> 00:07:44.141
versus 25 dollars to refer you
to see a physical therapist,

00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:47.665
or if he's getting paid the same thing
no matter what he recommends.

00:07:48.549 --> 00:07:51.247
Then, we go one step further.

00:07:51.247 --> 00:07:53.959
We add our values
when it comes to women's health,

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:56.180
LGBT health, alternative medicine,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.191
preventive health,
and end-of-life decisions.

00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:02.711
We pledge to our patients
that we are here to serve you,

00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:05.456
so you have a right to know who we are.

00:08:05.456 --> 00:08:08.146
We believe that transparency
can be the cure for fear.

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:12.266
I thought some doctors would sign on
and others wouldn't,

00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:16.570
but I had no idea of the huge backlash
that would ensue.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.719
Within one week of starting
Who's My Doctor?

00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:21.230
Medscape's public forum

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.260
and several online doctors' communities

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.228
had thousands of posts about this topic.

00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:28.288
Here are a few.

00:08:28.288 --> 00:08:30.548
From a gastroenterologist in Portland:

00:08:30.548 --> 00:08:33.760
"I devoted 12 years of my life
to being a slave.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.707
I have loans and mortgages.

00:08:35.707 --> 00:08:38.517
I depend on lunches from
drug companies to serve patients."

00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:42.251
Well, times may be hard for everyone,

00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:43.972
but try telling your patient

00:08:43.972 --> 00:08:46.986
making 35,000 dollars a year
to serve a family of four

00:08:46.986 --> 00:08:48.664
that you need the free lunch.

00:08:50.708 --> 00:08:53.041
From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte:

00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:57.639
"I find it an invasion of my privacy
to disclose where my income comes from.

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:59.932
My patients don't disclose
their incomes to me."

00:09:01.202 --> 00:09:04.428
But your patients' sources of income
don't affect your health.

00:09:05.737 --> 00:09:07.932
From a psychiatrist in New York City:

00:09:07.932 --> 00:09:11.351
"Pretty soon we will have to disclose
whether we prefer cats to dogs,

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:12.982
what model of car we drive,

00:09:12.982 --> 00:09:14.630
and what toilet paper we use."

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:18.168
Well, how you feel
about Toyotas or Cottonelle

00:09:18.168 --> 00:09:20.204
won't affect your patients' health,

00:09:20.204 --> 00:09:22.205
but your views
on a woman's right to choose

00:09:22.205 --> 00:09:25.509
and preventive medicine
and end-of-life decisions just might.

00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:29.374
And my favorite,
from a Kansas City cardiologist:

00:09:29.374 --> 00:09:32.456
"More government-mandated stuff?

00:09:32.456 --> 00:09:35.424
Dr. Wen needs to move
back to her own country."

00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:38.145
Well, two pieces of good news.

00:09:38.145 --> 00:09:41.760
First of all, this is meant to be
voluntary and not mandatory,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.040
and second of all, I'm American
and I'm already here.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.287
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:09:53.512 --> 00:09:56.241
Within a month, my employers
were getting calls

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:57.641
asking for me to be fired.

00:09:58.633 --> 00:10:01.806
I received mail
at my undisclosed home address

00:10:01.806 --> 00:10:05.300
with threats to contact
the medical board to sanction me.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.407
My friends and family urged me
to quit this campaign.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.771
After the bomb threat, I was done.

00:10:12.823 --> 00:10:14.765
But then I heard from patients.

00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:17.449
Over social media, a TweetChat,

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:19.377
which I'd learned what that was by then,

00:10:19.377 --> 00:10:22.867
generated 4.3 million impressions,

00:10:22.867 --> 00:10:26.772
and thousands of people wrote
to encourage me to continue.

00:10:26.772 --> 00:10:28.404
They wrote with things like,

00:10:28.404 --> 00:10:31.530
"If doctors are doing something
they're that ashamed of,

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.990
they shouldn't be doing it."

00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:37.175
"Elected officials have to disclose
campaign contributions.

00:10:37.175 --> 00:10:39.960
Lawyers have to disclose
conflicts of interests.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.782
Why shouldn't doctors?"

00:10:41.782 --> 00:10:44.510
And finally, many people wrote and said,

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.678
"Let us patients decide

00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:48.991
what's important
when we're choosing a doctor."

00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:51.833
In our initial trial,

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:55.436
over 300 doctors have taken
the total transparency pledge.

00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:58.841
What a crazy new idea, right?

00:10:58.841 --> 00:11:01.822
But actually, this is not
that new of a concept at all.

00:11:01.822 --> 00:11:03.614
Remember Dr. Sam, my doctor in China,

00:11:03.614 --> 00:11:06.413
with the goofy jokes and the wild hair?

00:11:06.413 --> 00:11:07.953
Well, she was my doctor,

00:11:07.953 --> 00:11:09.499
but she was also our neighbor

00:11:09.499 --> 00:11:11.681
who lived in the building
across the street.

00:11:11.681 --> 00:11:14.007
I went to the same school as her daughter.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.267
My parents and I trusted her

00:11:16.267 --> 00:11:18.663
because we knew who she was
and what she stood for,

00:11:18.663 --> 00:11:20.381
and she had no need to hide from us.

00:11:21.551 --> 00:11:25.221
Just one generation ago,
this was the norm in the U.S. as well.

00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:28.697
You knew that your family doctor
was the father of two teenage boys,

00:11:28.697 --> 00:11:30.542
that he quit smoking a few years ago,

00:11:30.542 --> 00:11:32.533
that he says he's a regular churchgoer,

00:11:32.533 --> 00:11:34.850
but you see him twice a year:
once at Easter

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.084
and once when his mother-in-law
comes to town.

00:11:38.492 --> 00:11:39.849
You knew what he was about,

00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:41.626
and he had no need to hide from you.

00:11:42.837 --> 00:11:45.168
But the sickness of fear has taken over,

00:11:45.168 --> 00:11:46.965
and patients suffer the consequences.

00:11:47.859 --> 00:11:49.239
I know this firsthand.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.423
My mother fought
her cancer for eight years.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.213
She was a planner,

00:11:54.238 --> 00:11:56.622
and she thought a lot
about how she wanted to live

00:11:56.623 --> 00:11:57.992
and how she wanted to die.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.101
Not only did she sign advance directives,

00:12:01.101 --> 00:12:04.891
she wrote a 12-page document
about how she had suffered enough,

00:12:04.951 --> 00:12:06.419
how it was time for her to go.

00:12:07.867 --> 00:12:09.901
One day, when I was a resident physician,

00:12:09.901 --> 00:12:12.988
I got a call to say that she was
in the intensive care unit.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.360
By the time I got there,
she was about to be intubated

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.979
and put on a breathing machine.

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:23.309
"But this is not what she wants,"
I said, "and we have documents."

00:12:24.145 --> 00:12:26.891
The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye,

00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:31.018
pointed at my then 16-year-old
sister, and said,

00:12:31.043 --> 00:12:33.161
"Do you remember when you were that age?

00:12:33.201 --> 00:12:36.169
How would you have liked to grow up
without your mother?"

00:12:37.568 --> 00:12:40.199
Her oncologist was there too, and said,

00:12:40.238 --> 00:12:42.177
"This is your mother.

00:12:42.177 --> 00:12:44.830
Can you really face yourself
for the rest of your life

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.607
if you don't do everything for her?"

00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:50.435
I knew my mother so well.

00:12:50.435 --> 00:12:53.595
I understood what
her directives meant so well,

00:12:53.595 --> 00:12:55.035
but I was a physician.

00:12:57.413 --> 00:13:01.884
That was the single hardest
decision I ever made,

00:13:01.884 --> 00:13:03.503
to let her die in peace,

00:13:04.933 --> 00:13:07.633
and I carry those words
of those doctors with me

00:13:07.633 --> 00:13:08.934
every single day.

00:13:11.142 --> 00:13:13.296
We can bridge the disconnect

00:13:13.356 --> 00:13:17.137
between what doctors do
and what patients need.

00:13:18.157 --> 00:13:20.838
We can get there,
because we've been there before,

00:13:20.838 --> 00:13:23.331
and we know that transparency
gets us to that trust.

00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:26.096
Research has shown us
that openness also helps doctors,

00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:27.702
that having open medical records,

00:13:27.702 --> 00:13:29.739
being willing to talk
about medical errors,

00:13:29.739 --> 00:13:31.429
will increase patient trust,

00:13:31.429 --> 00:13:33.150
improve health outcomes,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.210
and reduce malpractice.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.690
That openness, that trust,

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:38.383
is only going to be more important

00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:42.013
as we move from the infectious
to the behavioral model of disease.

00:13:42.013 --> 00:13:45.487
Bacteria may not care so much
about trust and intimacy,

00:13:45.487 --> 00:13:49.430
but for people to tackle
the hard lifestyle choices,

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.728
to address issues like smoking cessation,

00:13:51.728 --> 00:13:54.765
blood-pressure management
and diabetes control,

00:13:54.765 --> 00:13:57.495
well, that requires us to establish trust.

00:13:59.003 --> 00:14:01.873
Here's what other transparent
doctors have said.

00:14:01.873 --> 00:14:04.790
Brandon Combs, an internist in Denver:

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.803
"This has brought me
closer to my patients.

00:14:07.803 --> 00:14:10.502
The type of relationship I've developed —

00:14:10.547 --> 00:14:12.562
that's why I entered medicine."

00:14:14.117 --> 00:14:16.790
Aaron Stupple, an internist in Denver:

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:20.286
"I tell my patients
that I am totally open with them.

00:14:20.286 --> 00:14:22.360
I don't hide anything from them.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.286
This is me. Now tell me about you.

00:14:25.286 --> 00:14:27.518
We're in this together."

00:14:27.518 --> 00:14:29.920
May Nguyen, a family physician in Houston:

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.998
"My colleagues are astounded
by what I'm doing.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.584
They ask me how I could be so brave.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.472
I said, I'm not being brave,

00:14:39.552 --> 00:14:40.941
it's my job."

00:14:43.024 --> 00:14:45.218
I leave you today with a final thought.

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:49.732
Being totally transparent is scary.

00:14:49.772 --> 00:14:53.102
You feel naked, exposed and vulnerable,

00:14:53.102 --> 00:14:56.740
but that vulnerability, that humility,

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.256
it can be an extraordinary benefit
to the practice of medicine.

00:15:01.256 --> 00:15:03.664
When doctors are willing
to step off our pedestals,

00:15:03.664 --> 00:15:05.140
take off our white coats,

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.521
and show our patients who we are
and what medicine is all about,

00:15:08.521 --> 00:15:11.786
that's when we begin
to overcome the sickness of fear.

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:13.715
That's when we establish trust.

00:15:13.715 --> 00:15:16.175
That's when we change
the paradigm of medicine

00:15:16.175 --> 00:15:17.985
from one of secrecy and hiding

00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:20.344
to one that is fully open and engaged

00:15:20.344 --> 00:15:21.718
for our patients.

00:15:23.027 --> 00:15:24.924
Thank you.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:28.924
(Applause)
