WEBVTT

00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:04.513
On January 4, 1934,

00:00:04.513 --> 00:00:07.529
a young man delivered a report

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.914
to the United States Congress

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:11.868
that 80 years on,

00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:16.528
still shapes the lives of
everyone in this room today,

00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:22.222
still shapes the lives of
everyone on this planet.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.102
That young man wasn't a politician,

00:00:25.102 --> 00:00:27.101
he wasn't a businessman,

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:28.438
a civil rights activist

00:00:28.438 --> 00:00:30.213
or a faith leader.

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:33.484
He was that most unlikely of heroes,

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:35.981
an economist.

00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:39.552
His name was Simon Kuznets

00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:42.696
and the report that 
he delivered was called

00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:47.148
"National Income, 1929-1932."

00:00:47.148 --> 00:00:48.632
Now, you might think

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:51.723
this is a rather dry and dull report.

00:00:51.723 --> 00:00:53.805
And you're absolutely right.

00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:56.260
It's dry as a bone.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.570
But this report is the foundation

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.503
of how, today, we judge the 
success of countries:

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:05.052
what we know best as
Gross Domestic Product,

00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:07.363
GDP.

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:10.266
GDP has defined and shaped our lives

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.864
for the last 80 years.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:14.681
And today I want to talk about 


00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:18.520
a different way to measure
the success of countries,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.669
a different way to define 
and shape our lives

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:24.926
for the next 80 years.

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:26.817
But first, we have to understand

00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:30.726
how GDP came to
dominate our lives.

00:01:30.726 --> 00:01:32.986
Kuznets' report was delivered

00:01:32.986 --> 00:01:34.708
at a moment of crisis.

00:01:34.708 --> 00:01:36.734
The U.S. economy was plummeting

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:38.349
into the Great Depression

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:41.434
and policy makers were 
struggling to respond.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.579
Struggling because they didn't
know what was going on.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.961
They didn't have data and statistics.

00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:50.783
So what Kuznet's report gave them

00:01:50.783 --> 00:01:54.061
was reliable data on what 
the U.S. economy

00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:55.196
was producing,

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:58.264
updated year by year.

00:01:58.264 --> 00:02:00.604
And armed with this information,

00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:02.612
policy makers were, eventually,

00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:06.040
able to find a way out 
of the slump.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.922
And because Kuznets' invention

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:09.694
was found to be so useful,

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:11.382
it spread around the world.

00:02:11.382 --> 00:02:13.851
And now today, every country

00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:16.815
produces GDP statistics.

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:19.922
But, in that first report,

00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:23.466
Kuznets himself delivered a warning.

00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:25.447
It's in the introductory chapter.

00:02:25.447 --> 00:02:27.481
On page seven he says,

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:30.110
"The welfare of a nation can, therefore,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.664
scarcely be inferred

00:02:31.664 --> 00:02:33.664
from a measurement of 
national income

00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:35.601
as defined above."

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:38.969
It's not the greatest sound 
bite in the world,

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.598
and it's dressed up in the cautious 
language of the economist.

00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:44.774
But his message was clear:

00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:46.508
GDP is a tool

00:02:46.508 --> 00:02:49.566
to help us measure
economic performance.

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:52.534
It's not a measure
of our well-being.

00:02:52.534 --> 00:02:57.351
And it shouldn't be a guide 
to all decision making.

00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:00.221
But we have ignored Kuznets' warning.

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.777
We live in a world where

00:03:01.777 --> 00:03:04.900
GDP is the benchmark of success

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.177
in a global economy.

00:03:07.177 --> 00:03:10.406
Our politicians boast when
GDP goes up.

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:11.690
Markets move

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.564
and trillions of dollars of capital

00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:14.988
move around the world

00:03:14.988 --> 00:03:16.739
based on which countries
are going up

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.580
and which countries 
are going down,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.204
all measured in GDP.

00:03:21.204 --> 00:03:22.533
Our societies have become

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:26.908
engines to create more GDP.

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:30.443
But we know that GDP is flawed.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.973
It ignores the environment.

00:03:32.973 --> 00:03:36.629
It counts bombs and prisons as progress.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.871
It can't count happiness or community.

00:03:39.878 --> 00:03:44.621
And it has nothing to say 
about fairness or justice.

00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.321
Is it any surprise that our world,

00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:50.155
marching to the drumbeat of GDP,

00:03:50.155 --> 00:03:53.432
is teetering on the brink
of environmental disaster

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:56.938
and filled with anger and conflict?

00:03:56.938 --> 00:04:01.331
We need a better way
to measure our societies,

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:06.724
a measure based on the real 
things that matter to real people.

00:04:06.724 --> 00:04:08.686
Do I have enough to eat?

00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:10.762
Can I read and write?

00:04:10.762 --> 00:04:12.500
Am I safe?

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.655
Do I have rights?

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:17.784
Do I live in a society where
I'm not discriminated against?

00:04:17.784 --> 00:04:24.222
Is my future and the future of my children 
prevented from environmental destruction?

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.113
These are questions that GDP

00:04:26.113 --> 00:04:31.016
does not and cannot answer.

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:32.535
There have, of course,

00:04:32.535 --> 00:04:33.921
been efforts in the past

00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:36.563
to move beyond GDP.

00:04:36.563 --> 00:04:37.938
But I believe that we're living

00:04:37.938 --> 00:04:39.212
in a moment when we

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:42.952
are ready for a measurement revolution.

00:04:42.952 --> 00:04:45.628
We're ready because we've seen,

00:04:45.628 --> 00:04:47.862
in the financial crisis of 2008,

00:04:47.862 --> 00:04:50.681
how our fetish for economic growth

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.712
led us so far astray.

00:04:52.712 --> 00:04:55.096
We've seen, in the Arab Spring,

00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:56.941
how countries like Tunisia

00:04:56.941 --> 00:04:59.691
were supposedly economic superstars,

00:04:59.691 --> 00:05:01.216
but they were societies

00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:04.495
that were seething with discontentment.

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:08.183
We're ready, because today
we have the technology

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.498
to gather and analyze data

00:05:10.498 --> 00:05:14.545
in ways that would have been
unimaginable to Kuznets.

00:05:14.545 --> 00:05:19.428
Today, I'd like to introduce you 
to the Social Progress Index.

00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:22.155
It's a measure of the 
well-being of society,

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.912
completely separate from GDP.

00:05:24.912 --> 00:05:28.563
It's a whole new way
of looking at the world.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.179
The Social Progress Index

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:31.502
begins by defining what it

00:05:31.502 --> 00:05:33.449
means to be a good society

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.940
based around three dimensions.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.035
The first is, does everyone have
the basic needs for survival:

00:05:41.035 --> 00:05:43.885
food, water, shelter, safety?

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.605
Secondly, does everyone have

00:05:46.605 --> 00:05:49.436
access to the building blocks 
to improve their lives:

00:05:49.436 --> 00:05:53.948
education, information, health
and sustainable environment?

00:05:53.948 --> 00:05:57.632
And then third, does every 
individual have access

00:05:57.632 --> 00:06:00.412
to a chance to pursue their goals

00:06:00.412 --> 00:06:02.260
and dreams and ambitions

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.417
free from obstacles?

00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:04.964
Do they have rights,

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:06.353
freedom of choice,

00:06:06.353 --> 00:06:07.875
freedom from discrimination

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:11.336
and access to the the world's
most advanced knowledge?

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:14.700
Together, these 12 components

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.035
form the Social Progress framework.

00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:20.123
And for each of these 12 components,

00:06:20.123 --> 00:06:23.554
we have indicators to measure 
how countries are performing.

00:06:23.554 --> 00:06:26.683
Not indicators of effort or intention,

00:06:26.683 --> 00:06:28.931
but real achievement.

00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:32.133
We don't measure how much
a country spends on healthcare,

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:36.446
we measure the length and 
quality of people's lives.

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:41.045
We don't measure whether governments
pass laws against discrimination,

00:06:41.045 --> 00:06:45.475
we measure whether people 
experience discrimination.

00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:46.835
But what you want to know

00:06:46.835 --> 00:06:49.851
is who's top, don't you?
(Laughter)

00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:51.668
I knew that, I knew that, I knew that.

00:06:51.668 --> 00:06:53.194
Okay, I'm going to show you.

00:06:53.194 --> 00:06:55.590
I'm going to show you on this chart.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.934
So here we are,

00:06:56.934 --> 00:07:01.140
what I've done here is put on the 
vertical axis social progress.

00:07:01.146 --> 00:07:02.481
Higher is better.

00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:04.503
And then, just for comparison,

00:07:04.503 --> 00:07:05.825
just for fun,

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:09.684
on the horizontal axis
is GDP per capita.

00:07:09.693 --> 00:07:11.583
Further to the right is more.

00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:14.737
So the country in the world

00:07:14.737 --> 00:07:18.127
with the highest social progress,

00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:21.486
the number one country on social progress

00:07:21.486 --> 00:07:24.882
is New Zealand.

00:07:24.882 --> 00:07:28.398
(Applause)

00:07:28.398 --> 00:07:31.215
Well done! Never been; must go.

00:07:31.215 --> 00:07:33.537
(Laughter)

00:07:33.537 --> 00:07:36.399
The country with the least social progress,

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:38.714
I'm sorry to say, is Chad.

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:41.638
I've never been; maybe next year.

00:07:41.638 --> 00:07:43.447
(Laughter)

00:07:43.447 --> 00:07:45.639
Or maybe the year after.

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:47.212
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:48.592
You're thinking, "Aha,

00:07:48.592 --> 00:07:50.988
but New Zealand has a higher GDP

00:07:50.988 --> 00:07:52.850
than Chad!"

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.344
It's a good point, well made.

00:07:55.344 --> 00:07:56.806
But let me show you

00:07:56.806 --> 00:07:58.069
two other countries.

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:00.495
Here's the United States —

00:08:00.495 --> 00:08:03.242
considerably richer than New Zealand,

00:08:03.242 --> 00:08:05.688
but with a lower level of social progress.

00:08:05.688 --> 00:08:08.340
And then here's Senegal —

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.337
it's got a higher level of 
social progress than Chad,

00:08:12.337 --> 00:08:14.286
but the same level of GDP.

00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:16.035
So what's going on? Well, look.

00:08:16.035 --> 00:08:18.536
Let me bring in the rest of 
the countries of the world,

00:08:18.536 --> 00:08:20.744
the 132 we've been able to measure,

00:08:20.744 --> 00:08:23.082
each one represented by a dot.

00:08:23.082 --> 00:08:24.581
There we go. Lots of dots.

00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:26.323
Now, obviously I can't do all of them,

00:08:26.323 --> 00:08:28.056
so a few highlights for you:

00:08:28.056 --> 00:08:32.876
The highest ranked G7 country is Canada.

00:08:32.876 --> 00:08:34.980
My country, the United Kingdom,

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.697
is sort of middling, sort of dull,

00:08:37.697 --> 00:08:39.062
but who cares —

00:08:39.062 --> 00:08:41.240
at least we beat the French.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.167
(Laughter)

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:51.004
And then looking at the 
emerging economies,

00:08:51.004 --> 00:08:54.338
top of the BRICS, 
pleased to say, is Brazil.

00:08:54.338 --> 00:08:56.044
(Applause)

00:08:56.044 --> 00:08:57.831
Come on, cheer!

00:08:57.831 --> 00:08:59.773
Go, Brazil!

00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:01.306
Beating South Africa,

00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:02.599
then Russia,

00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:03.733
then China

00:09:03.733 --> 00:09:05.307
and then India.

00:09:05.307 --> 00:09:07.672
Tucked away on the right-hand side,

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:11.025
you will see a dot of a 
country with a lot of GDP

00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:12.968
but not a huge amount 
of social progress —

00:09:12.968 --> 00:09:14.946
that's Kuwait.

00:09:14.946 --> 00:09:16.637
Just above Brazil

00:09:16.637 --> 00:09:18.956
is a social progress superpower —

00:09:18.956 --> 00:09:20.456
that's Costa Rica.

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:24.431
It's got a level of social progress the same 
as some Western European countries,

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:26.400
with a much lower GDP.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.682
Now, my slide is getting 
a little cluttered

00:09:28.682 --> 00:09:30.364
and I'd like to step back a bit.

00:09:30.364 --> 00:09:31.818
So let me take away these countries,

00:09:31.818 --> 00:09:34.732
and then pop in the regression line.

00:09:34.732 --> 00:09:36.385
So this shows the average relationship

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:38.896
between GDP and social progress.

00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:41.138
The first thing to notice,

00:09:41.138 --> 00:09:42.993
is that there's lots of noise

00:09:42.993 --> 00:09:44.690
around the trend line.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.275
And what this shows,

00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:49.157
what this empirically demonstrates,

00:09:49.157 --> 00:09:52.192
is that GDP is not destiny.

00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:55.395
At every level of GDP per capita,

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:58.593
there are opportunities
for more social progress,

00:09:58.593 --> 00:10:00.596
risks of less.

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:02.056
The second thing to notice

00:10:02.056 --> 00:10:04.559
is that for poor countries,

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:06.532
the curve is really steep.

00:10:06.532 --> 00:10:07.807
So what this tells us is that

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.060
if poor countries can get

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.954
a little bit of extra GDP,

00:10:10.954 --> 00:10:12.737
and if they reinvest that

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.409
in doctors, nurses, water supplies,

00:10:15.409 --> 00:10:16.782
sanitation, etc.,

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:18.801
there's a lot of social progress bang

00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:20.387
for your GDP buck.

00:10:20.387 --> 00:10:23.962
And that's good news, and that's what 
we've seen over the last 20, 30 years,

00:10:23.962 --> 00:10:25.963
with a lot of people lifted out of poverty

00:10:25.963 --> 00:10:28.173
by economic growth and good policies

00:10:28.173 --> 00:10:30.045
in poorer countries.

00:10:30.045 --> 00:10:32.242
But go on a bit further up the curve,

00:10:32.242 --> 00:10:34.351
and then we see it flattening out.

00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:36.603
Each extra dollar of GDP

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:39.839
is buying less and less social progress.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.513
And with more and more
of the world's population

00:10:42.513 --> 00:10:45.076
living on this part of the curve,

00:10:45.076 --> 00:10:47.300
it means GDP is becoming

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.084
less and less useful

00:10:49.084 --> 00:10:51.600
as a guide to our development.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.747
I'll show you an example of Brazil.

00:10:53.747 --> 00:10:54.970
Here's Brazil:

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.837
social progress of about 70 out of 100,

00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:00.335
GDP per capita about 
14,000 dollars a year.

00:11:00.335 --> 00:11:03.256
And look, Brazil's above the line.

00:11:03.256 --> 00:11:05.142
Brazil is doing a reasonably good job

00:11:05.142 --> 00:11:08.467
of turning GDP into social progress.

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:10.454
But where does Brazil go next?

00:11:10.454 --> 00:11:11.966
Let's say that Brazil

00:11:11.966 --> 00:11:13.738
adopts a bold economic plan

00:11:13.738 --> 00:11:16.041
to double GDP in the next decade.

00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:19.657
But that is only half a plan.

00:11:19.657 --> 00:11:21.934
It's less than half a plan,

00:11:21.934 --> 00:11:25.182
because where does Brazil
want to go on social progress?

00:11:25.186 --> 00:11:27.504
Brazil, it's possible

00:11:27.504 --> 00:11:29.239
to increase your growth,

00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:30.816
increase your GDP,

00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:32.706
while stagnating or going backwards

00:11:32.706 --> 00:11:34.055
on social progress.

00:11:34.055 --> 00:11:35.241
We don't want Brazil

00:11:35.241 --> 00:11:36.973
to become like Russia.

00:11:36.973 --> 00:11:39.288
What you really want is for Brazil

00:11:39.288 --> 00:11:44.241
to get ever more efficient at creating 
social progress from its GDP,

00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:46.539
so it becomes more like New Zealand.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.119
And what that means is that

00:11:48.119 --> 00:11:50.776
Brazil needs to prioritize social progress

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:52.468
in its development plan

00:11:52.468 --> 00:11:54.880
and see that it's not just growth alone,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.532
it's growth with social progress.

00:11:57.532 --> 00:12:00.150
And that's what the Social 
Progress Index does:

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.760
It reframes the debate about development,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.820
not just about GDP alone,

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.399
but inclusive, sustainable growth

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:11.818
that brings real improvements 
in people's lives.

00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:14.394
And it's not just about countries.

00:12:14.394 --> 00:12:17.184
Earlier this year,

00:12:17.184 --> 00:12:21.751
with our friends from the Imazon 
nonprofit here in Brazil,

00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:26.408
we launched the first subnational 
Social Progress Index.

00:12:26.408 --> 00:12:28.868
We did it for the Amazon region.

00:12:28.868 --> 00:12:32.655
It's an area the size of 
Europe, 24 million people,

00:12:32.656 --> 00:12:35.084
one of the most deprived 
parts of the country.

00:12:35.084 --> 00:12:36.994
And here are the results,

00:12:36.994 --> 00:12:38.629
and this is broken down

00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:42.133
into nearly 800 different municipalities.

00:12:42.133 --> 00:12:43.816
And with this detailed information

00:12:43.816 --> 00:12:46.034
about the real quality of life

00:12:46.034 --> 00:12:47.977
in this part of the country,

00:12:47.977 --> 00:12:49.957
Imazon and other partners

00:12:49.957 --> 00:12:52.286
from government, 
business and civil society

00:12:52.286 --> 00:12:54.000
can work together to construct

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.677
a development plan

00:12:55.677 --> 00:12:58.014
that will help really improve
people's lives,

00:12:58.014 --> 00:13:01.250
while protecting that 
precious global asset

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.221
that is the Amazon Rainforest.

00:13:04.221 --> 00:13:06.122
And this is just the beginning,

00:13:06.122 --> 00:13:08.501
You can create a Social Progress Index

00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:13.656
for any state, region, 
city or municipality.

00:13:13.656 --> 00:13:15.729
We all know and love TEDx;

00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:17.971
this is Social Pogress-x.

00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:21.165
This is a tool for anyone to come and use.

00:13:21.165 --> 00:13:24.045
Contrary to the way we 
sometimes talk about it,

00:13:24.045 --> 00:13:30.365
GDP was not handed down from 
God on tablets of stone. (Laughter)

00:13:30.365 --> 00:13:34.360
It's a measurement tool
invented in the 20th century

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.152
to address the challenges
of the 20th century.

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.004
In the 21st century,

00:13:41.004 --> 00:13:43.456
we face new challenges:

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:46.564
aging, obesity, climate change, and so on.

00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:48.223
To face those challenges,

00:13:48.223 --> 00:13:50.243
we need new tools of measurement,

00:13:50.243 --> 00:13:53.997
new ways of valuing progress.

00:13:53.997 --> 00:13:56.395
Imagine if we could measure

00:13:56.395 --> 00:13:58.925
what nonprofits, charities,

00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:00.894
volunteers, civil society organizations

00:14:00.894 --> 00:14:04.700
really contribute to our society.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.768
Imagine if businesses competed

00:14:07.768 --> 00:14:11.179
not just on the basis of
their economic contribution,

00:14:11.179 --> 00:14:15.003
but on their contribution 
to social progress.

00:14:15.003 --> 00:14:18.950
Imagine if we could hold 
politicians to account

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:23.146
for really improving people's lives.

00:14:23.146 --> 00:14:26.131
Imagine if we could work together —

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:31.199
government, business, 
civil society, me, you —

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:36.690
and make this century the 
century of social progress.

00:14:36.704 --> 00:14:37.783
Thank you.

00:14:37.783 --> 00:14:43.815
(Applause)
