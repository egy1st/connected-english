00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:02.649
Picture this:

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:03.742
It's Monday morning,

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:04.861
you're at the office,

00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:06.615
you're settling in for the day at work,

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:09.437
and this guy that you sort of 
recognize from down the hall,

00:00:09.437 --> 00:00:11.273
walks right into your cubicle

00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:12.675
and he steals your chair.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:13.917
Doesn't say a word —

00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:15.305
just rolls away with it.

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:17.788
Doesn't give you any information
about why he took your chair

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:19.899
out of all the other chairs 
that are out there.

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:22.041
Doesn't acknowledge the fact 
that you might need your chair

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:23.582
to get some work done today.

00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:25.839
You wouldn't stand for 
it. You'd make a stink.

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.866
You'd follow that guy
back to his cubicle

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:31.178
and you'd say, "Why my chair?"

00:00:31.178 --> 00:00:35.299
Okay, so now it's Tuesday morning
and you're at the office,

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:38.028
and a meeting invitation pops 
up in your calendar.

00:00:38.028 --> 00:00:39.633
(Laughter)

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:42.709
And it's from this woman who you 
kind of know from down the hall,

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:46.514
and the subject line references some 
project that you heard a little bit about.

00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:48.197
But there's no agenda.

00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:51.273
There's no information about why
you were invited to the meeting.

00:00:51.273 --> 00:00:55.889
And yet you accept the 
meeting invitation, and you go.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.816
And when this highly 
unproductive session is over,

00:00:58.816 --> 00:01:00.499
you go back to your desk,

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.008
and you stand at your 
desk and you say,

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.671
"Boy, I wish I had those two hours back,

00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:06.674
like I wish I had my chair back."

00:01:06.674 --> 00:01:08.180
(Laughter)

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.751
Every day, we allow our coworkers,

00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:12.965
who are otherwise very, 
very nice people,

00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:14.632
to steal from us.

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:18.710
And I'm talking about something far 
more valuable than office furniture.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.739
I'm talking about time. Your time.

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:24.392
In fact, I believe that

00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:26.877
we are in the middle
of a global epidemic

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:31.917
of a terrible new illness
known as MAS:

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:34.190
Mindless Accept Syndrome.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.084
(Laughter)

00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:38.785
The primary symptom of 
Mindless Accept Syndrome


00:01:38.785 --> 00:01:42.705
is just accepting a meeting invitation
the minute it pops up in your calendar.

00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:43.975
(Laughter)

00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:47.643
It's an involuntary reflex — ding, 
click, bing — it's in your calendar,

00:01:47.643 --> 00:01:50.936
"Gotta go, I'm already late 
for a meeting." (Laughter)

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:53.323
Meetings are important, right?

00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:56.269
And collaboration is key to 
the success of any enterprise.

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:59.662
And a well-run meeting can yield 
really positive, actionable results.

00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:01.420
But between globalization

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.735
and pervasive information technology,

00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:05.406
the way that we work

00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:08.635
has really changed dramatically 
over the last few years.

00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:11.842
And we're miserable. (Laughter)

00:02:11.842 --> 00:02:15.382
And we're miserable not because the 
other guy can't run a good meeting,

00:02:15.382 --> 00:02:18.194
it's because of MAS, our 
Mindless Accept Syndrome,

00:02:18.194 --> 00:02:21.970
which is a self-inflicted wound.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.117
Actually, I have evidence to prove
that MAS is a global epidemic.

00:02:27.117 --> 00:02:28.764
Let me tell you why.

00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:33.036
A couple of years ago, I put a video 
on Youtube, and in the video,

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:36.234
I acted out every terrible 
conference call you've ever been on.

00:02:36.234 --> 00:02:37.893
It goes on for about five minutes,

00:02:37.893 --> 00:02:41.084
and it has all the things that we 
hate about really bad meetings.

00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:44.427
There's the moderator who has 
no idea how to run the meeting.

00:02:44.427 --> 00:02:46.985
There are the participants who 
have no idea why they're there.

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:50.688
The whole thing kind of collapses
into this collaborative train wreck.

00:02:50.688 --> 00:02:53.114
And everybody leaves very angry.

00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:54.903
It's kind of funny.

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:56.486
(Laughter)

00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:58.638
Let's take a quick look.

00:02:58.638 --> 00:03:02.465
(Video) Our goal today is to come to an 
agreement on a very important proposal.

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:04.552
As a group, we need to decide if —

00:03:04.552 --> 00:03:07.331
bloop bloop —

00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.898
Hi, who just joined?

00:03:10.898 --> 00:03:13.910
Hi, it's Joe. I'm working from home today.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.800
(Laughter)

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.868
Hi, Joe. Thanks for 
joining us today, great.

00:03:18.868 --> 00:03:21.658
I was just saying, we have a lot of people 
on the call we'd like to get through,

00:03:21.658 --> 00:03:23.292
so let's skip the roll call 


00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:25.965
and I'm gonna dive right in.

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:29.840
Our goal today is to come to an 
agreement on a very important proposal.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.405
As a group, we need to decide if —

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:33.698
bloop bloop —

00:03:33.698 --> 00:03:35.161
(Laughter)

00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:37.184
Hi, who just joined?

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:41.993
No? I thought I heard a beep. (Laughter)

00:03:41.993 --> 00:03:43.629
Sound familiar?

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.606
Yeah, it sounds familiar 
to me, too.

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:47.662
A couple of weeks after I put that online,

00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:50.463
500,000 people in dozens of countries,

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:52.103
I mean dozens of countries,

00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:53.287
watched this video.

00:03:53.287 --> 00:03:56.641
And three years later, it's still getting 
thousands of views every month.

00:03:56.641 --> 00:03:58.608
It's close to about a million right now.

00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:00.616
And in fact, some of the biggest
companies in the world,

00:04:00.616 --> 00:04:02.526
companies that you've 
heard of but I won't name,

00:04:02.526 --> 00:04:06.421
have asked for my permission to use 
this video in their new-hire training

00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:10.670
to teach their new employees how 
not to run a meeting at their company.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.155
And if the numbers —

00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:14.536
there are a million views and it's
being used by all these companies —

00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:18.062
aren't enough proof that we have 
a global problem with meetings,

00:04:18.062 --> 00:04:19.839
there are the many, many thousands

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.459
of comments posted online

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.647
after the video went up.

00:04:23.647 --> 00:04:25.621
Thousands of people wrote things like,

00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:27.475
"OMG, that was my day today!"

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.438
"That was my day every day!"

00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:30.597
"This is my life."

00:04:30.597 --> 00:04:31.527
One guy wrote,

00:04:31.527 --> 00:04:33.066
"It's funny because it's true.

00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:34.973
Eerily, sadly, depressingly true.

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:36.691
It made me laugh until I cried.

00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:39.441
And cried. And I cried some more."

00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:41.073
(Laughter)

00:04:41.073 --> 00:04:42.534
This poor guy said,

00:04:42.534 --> 00:04:47.611
"My daily life until 
retirement or death, sigh."

00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:49.011
These are real quotes

00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:50.810
and it's real sad.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.633
A common theme running through
all of these comments online

00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:56.174
is this fundamental belief 
that we are powerless

00:04:56.174 --> 00:04:58.075
to do anything other 
than go to meetings

00:04:58.075 --> 00:05:00.453
and suffer through these 
poorly run meetings

00:05:00.453 --> 00:05:02.542
and live to meet another day.

00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:05.683
But the truth is, we're 
not powerless at all.

00:05:05.683 --> 00:05:08.776
In fact, the cure for MAS
is right here in our hands.

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:10.977
It's right at our fingertips, literally.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:14.238
It's something that I call ¡No MAS!

00:05:14.238 --> 00:05:16.468
(Laughter)

00:05:16.468 --> 00:05:18.866
Which, if I remember my 
high school Spanish,

00:05:18.866 --> 00:05:21.657
means something like, 
"Enough already, make it stop!"

00:05:21.657 --> 00:05:24.409
Here's how No MAS 
works. It's very simple.

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.606
First of all, the next time you 
get a meeting invitation

00:05:27.606 --> 00:05:30.453
that doesn't have a lot 
of information in it at all,

00:05:30.453 --> 00:05:32.293
click the tentative button!

00:05:32.293 --> 00:05:34.743
It's okay, you're allowed, 
that's why it's there.

00:05:34.743 --> 00:05:36.252
It's right next to the accept button.

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:39.846
Or the maybe button, or whatever button 
is there for you not to accept immediately.

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:43.629
Then, get in touch with the person
who asked you to the meeting.

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.215
Tell them you're very excited 
to support their work,

00:05:46.215 --> 00:05:48.230
ask them what the goal 
of the meeting is,

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.917
and tell them you're interested in learning 
how you can help them achieve their goal.

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:53.845
And if we do this often enough,

00:05:53.845 --> 00:05:55.183
and we do it respectfully,

00:05:55.183 --> 00:05:57.220
people might start to be 
a little bit more thoughtful

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.682
about the way they put together
meeting invitations.

00:05:59.682 --> 00:06:02.534
And you can make more thoughtful 
decisions about accepting it.

00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:05.794
People might actually start 
sending out agendas. Imagine!

00:06:05.794 --> 00:06:09.542
Or they might not have a conference call
with 12 people to talk about a status

00:06:09.542 --> 00:06:12.825
when they could just do a quick
email and get it done with.

00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:17.659
People just might start to change their 
behavior because you changed yours.

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:21.144
And they just might bring
your chair back, too. (Laughter)

00:06:21.144 --> 00:06:22.519
No MAS!

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:23.959
Thank you.

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:26.025
(Applause).
