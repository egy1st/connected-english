WEBVTT

00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:02.436
I haven't told many people this,

00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:04.832
but in my head, I've got

00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:06.969
thousands of secret worlds all going on

00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:09.270
all at the same time.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.603
I am also autistic.

00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:13.549
People tend to diagnose autism

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.868
with really specific 
check-box descriptions,

00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:19.916
but in reality, it's a whole
variation as to what we're like.

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:21.649
For instance, my little brother,

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:23.426
he's very severely autistic.

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:25.688
He's nonverbal. He can't talk at all.

00:00:25.688 --> 00:00:28.180
But I love to talk.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.483
People often associate autism

00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:34.156
with liking maths and 
science and nothing else,

00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:35.955
but I know so many autistic people

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:38.328
who love being creative.

00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:40.770
But that is a stereotype,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.626
and the stereotypes of things

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:45.888
are often, if not always, wrong.

00:00:45.888 --> 00:00:48.306
For instance, a lot of people

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:52.559
think autism and think 
"Rain Man" immediately.

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.051
That's the common belief,

00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:57.346
that every single autistic 
person is Dustin Hoffman,

00:00:57.346 --> 00:01:00.349
and that's not true.

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:03.150
But that's not just with 
autistic people, either.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.490
I've seen it with LGBTQ people,

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.910
with women, with POC people.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.428
People are so afraid of variety

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:13.229
that they try to fit everything 
into a tiny little box

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.524
with really specific labels.

00:01:15.524 --> 00:01:17.155
This is something that actually

00:01:17.155 --> 00:01:19.833
happened to me in real life:

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:22.521
I googled "autistic people are ..."

00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:24.624
and it comes up with suggestions

00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:26.649
as to what you're going to type.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.404
I googled "autistic people are ..."

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:31.617
and the top result was "demons."

00:01:31.617 --> 00:01:33.875
That is the first thing that people think

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.879
when they think autism.

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:37.785
They know.

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:40.994
(Laughter)

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:47.201
One of the things I can do 
because I'm autistic —

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:49.642
it's an ability rather than a disability —

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:53.177
is I've got a very, very vivid imagination.

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:54.850
Let me explain it to you a bit.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.100
It's like I'm walking in two 
worlds most of the time.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.634
There's the real world, 
the world that we all share,

00:01:59.634 --> 00:02:01.614
and there's the world in my mind,

00:02:01.614 --> 00:02:04.651
and the world in my mind 
is often so much more real

00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:07.138
than the real world.

00:02:07.138 --> 00:02:10.509
Like, it's very easy for 
me to let my mind loose

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.380
because I don't try and fit 
myself into a tiny little box.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.619
That's one of the best 
things about being autistic.

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.588
You don't have the urge to do that.

00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:20.356
You find what you want to do,

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:23.140
you find a way to do it, 
and you get on with it.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.293
If I was trying to fit myself into a box,

00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:27.445
I wouldn't be here, I 
wouldn't have achieved

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:29.595
half the things that I have now.

00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:31.371
There are problems, though.

00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:33.536
There are problems with being autistic,

00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:36.256
and there are problems with
having too much imagination.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.459
School can be a problem in general,

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.490
but having also to explain to a teacher

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.672
on a daily basis

00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:48.317
that their lesson is inexplicably dull

00:02:48.317 --> 00:02:50.938
and you are secretly taking refuge

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:54.900
in a world inside your head in 
which you are not in that lesson,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.396
that adds to your list of problems.

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:00.264
(Laughter)

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:04.684
Also, when my imagination takes hold,

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.518
my body takes on a life of its own.

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:09.476
When something very exciting
happens in my inner world,

00:03:09.476 --> 00:03:10.980
I've just got to run.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.896
I've got to rock backwards and forwards,

00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:14.684
or sometimes scream.

00:03:14.684 --> 00:03:16.934
This gives me so much energy,

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:19.555
and I've got to have an 
outlet for all that energy.

00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:21.659
But I've done that ever 
since I was a child,

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.377
ever since I was a tiny little girl.

00:03:23.377 --> 00:03:26.246
And my parents thought it was 
cute, so they didn't bring it up,

00:03:26.246 --> 00:03:27.864
but when I got into school,

00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:30.165
they didn't really agree that it was cute.

00:03:30.165 --> 00:03:32.830
It can be that people 
don't want to be friends

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.807
with the girl that starts 
screaming in an algebra lesson.

00:03:35.807 --> 00:03:39.713
And this doesn't normally 
happen in this day and age,

00:03:39.713 --> 00:03:43.290
but it can be that people don't want 
to be friends with the autistic girl.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.572
It can be that people 
don't want to associate

00:03:46.572 --> 00:03:49.336
with anyone who won't 
or can't fit themselves

00:03:49.336 --> 00:03:52.306
into a box that's labeled normal.

00:03:52.306 --> 00:03:54.472
But that's fine with me,

00:03:54.472 --> 00:03:56.606
because it sorts the wheat from the chaff,

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:59.373
and I can find which people 
are genuine and true

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:01.929
and I can pick these people as my friends.

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.349
But if you think about it, what is normal?

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.160
What does it mean?

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.940
Imagine if that was the best 
compliment you ever received.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.221
"Wow, you are really normal."

00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.606
(Laughter)

00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:17.010
But compliments are,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.418
"you are extraordinary"

00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:20.252
or "you step outside the box."

00:04:20.252 --> 00:04:21.973
It's "you're amazing."

00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:23.863
So if people want to be these things,

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:26.371
why are so many people 
striving to be normal?

00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:31.385
Why are people pouring their 
brilliant individual light into a mold?

00:04:31.385 --> 00:04:36.140
People are so afraid of variety 
that they try and force everyone,

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.858
even people who don't want 
to or can't, to become normal.

00:04:39.858 --> 00:04:42.697
There are camps for LGBTQ people

00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:46.173
or autistic people to try and 
make them this "normal,"

00:04:46.173 --> 00:04:50.698
and that's terrifying that people 
would do that in this day and age.

00:04:50.698 --> 00:04:55.305
All in all, I wouldn't trade my autism
and my imagination for the world.

00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:57.295
Because I am autistic,

00:04:57.295 --> 00:05:00.287
I've presented documentaries to the BBC,

00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:02.526
I'm in the midst of writing a book,

00:05:02.526 --> 00:05:04.674
I'm doing this — this is fantastic —

00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:07.925
and one of the best 
things that I've achieved,

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:10.510
that I consider to have achieved,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.492
is I've found ways of communicating

00:05:12.492 --> 00:05:14.337
with my little brother and sister,

00:05:14.337 --> 00:05:17.700
who as I've said are nonverbal. 
They can't speak.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.560
And people would often write
off someone who's nonverbal,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.294
but that's silly, because 
my little brother and sister

00:05:23.294 --> 00:05:25.987
are the best siblings that 
you could ever hope for.

00:05:25.987 --> 00:05:28.274
They're just the best, 
and I love them so much

00:05:28.274 --> 00:05:31.829
and I care about them 
more than anything else.

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:34.507
I'm going to leave you with one question:

00:05:34.507 --> 00:05:37.644
If we can't get inside the person's minds,

00:05:37.644 --> 00:05:39.737
no matter if they're autistic or not,

00:05:39.737 --> 00:05:42.774
instead of punishing anything
that strays from normal,

00:05:42.774 --> 00:05:44.529
why not celebrate uniqueness

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.590
and cheer every time someone
unleashes their imagination?

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.166
Thank you.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:55.346
(Applause)
