00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.327
I want you guys to imagine 
that you're a soldier

00:00:03.327 --> 00:00:05.228
running through the battlefield.

00:00:05.228 --> 00:00:07.444
Now, you're shot in the leg with a bullet,

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:09.671
which severs your femoral artery.

00:00:09.671 --> 00:00:11.797
Now, this bleed is extremely traumatic

00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:14.532
and can kill you in less 
than three minutes.

00:00:14.532 --> 00:00:16.600
Unfortunately, by the time that a medic

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.276
actually gets to you,

00:00:18.276 --> 00:00:20.527
what the medic has on his or her belt

00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:22.787
can take five minutes or more,

00:00:22.787 --> 00:00:25.951
with the application of pressure,
to stop that type of bleed.

00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:28.204
Now, this problem is 
not only a huge problem

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:30.893
for the military, but it's 
also a huge problem

00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:33.875
that's epidemic throughout 
the entire medical field,

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.506
which is how do we actually look at wounds

00:00:36.506 --> 00:00:38.307
and how do we stop them quickly

00:00:38.307 --> 00:00:40.668
in a way that can work with the body?

00:00:40.668 --> 00:00:43.481
So now, what I've been working
on for the last four years

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:46.476
is to develop smart biomaterials,

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:48.453
which are actually materials that will work

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:50.635
with the body, helping it to heal

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:54.995
and helping it to allow the 
wounds to heal normally.

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:58.585
So now, before we do this, we 
have to take a much closer look

00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:00.743
at actually how does the body work.

00:01:00.743 --> 00:01:02.133
So now, everybody here knows

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.230
that the body is made up of cells.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.947
So the cell is the most basic unit of life.

00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:09.411
But not many people know what else.

00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:11.942
But it actually turns out that your cells

00:01:11.942 --> 00:01:14.686
sit in this mesh of complicated fibers,

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:16.319
proteins and sugars

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.331
known as the extracellular matrix.

00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:20.160
So now, the ECM

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.190
is actually this mesh that 
holds the cells in place,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.030
provides structure for your tissues,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.476
but it also gives the cells a home.

00:01:27.476 --> 00:01:29.603
It allows them to feel what they're doing,

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:31.188
where they are, and tells them

00:01:31.188 --> 00:01:33.528
how to act and how to behave.

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:36.460
And it actually turns out that 
the extracellular matrix

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.423
is different from every 
single part of the body.

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:40.840
So the ECM in my skin

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.955
is different than the ECM in my liver,

00:01:42.955 --> 00:01:45.733
and the ECM in different 
parts of the same organ

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.941
actually vary, so it's very difficult

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.718
to be able to have a product

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:52.125
that will react to the 
local extracellular matrix,

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:54.218
which is exactly what we're trying to do.

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:56.940
So now, for example, 
think of the rainforest.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.325
You have the canopy, 
you have the understory,

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:00.900
and you have the forest floor.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.685
Now, all of these parts of the forest

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:04.451
are made up of different plants,

00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:06.869
and different animals call them home.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.180
So just like that, the extracellular matrix

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.972
is incredibly diverse in three dimensions.

00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:14.889
On top of that, the extracellular matrix

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.420
is responsible for all wound healing,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.175
so if you imagine cutting the body,

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:21.200
you actually have to rebuild

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.157
this very complex ECM

00:02:23.157 --> 00:02:25.200
in order to get it to form again,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.779
and a scar, in fact, is actually

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.233
poorly formed extracellular matrix.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.291
So now, behind me is an animation

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:33.899
of the extracellular matrix.

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.555
So as you see, your cells sit 
in this complicated mesh

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:39.187
and as you move throughout the tissue,

00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:41.268
the extracellular matrix changes.

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:44.075
So now every other piece 
of technology on the market

00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:47.151
can only manage a two-
dimensional approximation

00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:48.906
of the extracellular matrix,

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:50.694
which means that it doesn't fit in

00:02:50.694 --> 00:02:52.460
with the tissue itself.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.260
So when I was a freshman at NYU,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.464
what I discovered was 
you could actually take

00:02:56.464 --> 00:02:58.985
small pieces of plant-derived polymers

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:01.639
and reassemble them onto the wound.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.297
So if you have a bleeding 
wound like the one behind me,

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:06.870
you can actually put 
our material onto this,

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.810
and just like Lego blocks,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.993
it'll reassemble into the local tissue.

00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:12.859
So that means if you put it onto liver,

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.610
it turns into something 
that looks like liver,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.133
and if you put it onto skin,

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:18.236
it turns into something 
that looks just like skin.

00:03:18.236 --> 00:03:19.616
So when you put the gel on,

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.927
it actually reassembles 
into this local tissue.

00:03:22.927 --> 00:03:26.533
So now, this has a whole 
bunch of applications,

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:29.485
but basically the idea is,
wherever you put this product,

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:32.320
you're able to reassemble 
into it immediately.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.681
Now, this is a simulated arterial bleed —

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.040
blood warning —

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.840
at twice human artery pressure.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.273
So now, this type of bleed 
is incredibly traumatic,

00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:42.500
and like I said before, 
would actually take

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.356
five minutes or more with pressure

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:45.728
to be able to stop.

00:03:45.728 --> 00:03:48.749
Now, in the time that it takes
me to introduce the bleed itself,

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:50.878
our material is able to stop that bleed,

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:53.154
and it's because it actually 
goes on and works

00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:54.886
with the body to heal,

00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:57.258
so it reassembles into this piece of meat,

00:03:57.258 --> 00:04:00.138
and then the blood actually recognizes

00:04:00.138 --> 00:04:02.725
that that's happening, 
and produces fibrin,

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:06.470
producing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.349
So now this technology — Thank you.

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.733
(Applause)

00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:20.188
So now this technology, by January,
will be in the hands of veterinarians,

00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:23.765
and we're working very diligently to 
try to get it into the hands of doctors,

00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:25.530
hopefully within the next year.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.137
But really, once again, I 
want you guys to imagine

00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:30.160
that you are a soldier running 
through a battlefield.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.927
Now, you get hit in the leg with a bullet,

00:04:31.927 --> 00:04:35.260
and instead of bleeding 
out in three minutes,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.248
you pull a small pack 
of gel out of your belt,

00:04:37.248 --> 00:04:38.575
and with the press of a button,

00:04:38.575 --> 00:04:39.984
you're able to stop your own bleed

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:41.893
and you're on your way to recovery.

00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:43.783
Thank you very much.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.783
(Applause)
