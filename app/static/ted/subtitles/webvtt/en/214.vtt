00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's a simple idea about nature.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I want to say a word for nature

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and tell you about a tool, a very simple tool that I have found.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit; it's not a technology.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural world

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and to the other species on whom we depend.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And that tool is very simply, as Chris suggested,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
looking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's not my idea, other people have hit on it,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but I've tried to take it to some new places.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Let me tell you where I got it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Like a lot of my ideas, like a lot of the tools I use,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I found it in the garden; I'm a very devoted gardener.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And there was a day about seven years ago: I was planting potatoes,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
it was the first week of May --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
this is New England, when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
they're just white clouds above.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I was here, planting my chunks,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
cutting up potatoes and planting it,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and the bees were working on this tree;

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
bumblebees, just making this thing vibrate.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And one of the things I really like about gardening

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is that it doesn't take all your concentration,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
you really can't get hurt -- it's not like woodworking --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
working alongside that bumblebee,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
was: what did I and that bumblebee have in common?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
How was our role in this garden similar and different?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common:

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and both of us -- probably, if I can imagine the bee's point of view --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
thought we were calling the shots.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I had picked my Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn, or whatever it was --

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and I had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
brought it, and I was planting it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And that bee, no doubt, assumed that it had decided,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
"I'm going for that apple tree, I'm going for that blossom,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are;

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I plant the potatoes, I weed the garden, I domesticate the species.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But that day, it occurred to me:

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Because, of course, the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
but we know better.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We know that what's going on between the bee and that flower

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits --

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
color, scent, flavor, pattern -- that has lured that bee in.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and also picking up some powder on its leg,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and going off to the next blossom.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The bee is not calling the shots.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And I realized then, I wasn't either.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I had been seduced by that potato and not another

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
into planting its -- into spreading its genes, giving it a little bit more habitat.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And that's when I got the idea, which was, "Well, what would happen

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?"

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention, not as a human technology,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
but as a co-evolutionary development

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
in which a group of very clever species, mostly edible grasses, had exploited us,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
The competition of grasses, right?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And suddenly everything looked different.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I had thought always -- and in fact, had written this in my first book;

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
this was a book about gardening --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
that lawns were nature under culture's boot,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that they were totalitarian landscapes,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and never letting it set seed or die or have sex.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And that's what the lawn was.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But then I realized, "No, this is exactly what the grasses want us to do.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I'm a dupe. I'm a dupe of the lawns, whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
who they compete with for sunlight."

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And so by getting us to mow the lawn, we keep the trees from coming back,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
which in New England happens very, very quickly.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So I started looking at things this way

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and wrote a whole book about it called "The Botany of Desire."

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that they like sweetness, that they like this color and not that color, that they like symmetry --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
That a certain kind of potato, a certain kind of drug,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
a sativa-indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And that, wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Now, the test of any idea -- I said it was a literary conceit --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
is what does it get us?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And when you're talking about nature, which is really my subject as a writer,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Which is, does it make us better citizens of the biotic community?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
rather than its destruction?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And I would submit that this idea does this.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So, let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
besides some entertaining insights about human desire.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000
As an intellectual matter, looking at the world from other species' points of view

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
helps us deal with this weird anomaly,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history --

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Ugh. Mini-Me. (Laughter)

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
we figured out we are just one species among many;

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
we are acted upon as well as acting;

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
we are really in the fiber, the fabric of life.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
But the weird thing is, we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later;

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
none of us really believes this.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
We are still Cartesians -- the children of Descartes --

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
who believe that subjectivity, consciousness, sets us apart;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that the world is divided into subjects and objects;

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
that there is nature on one side, culture on another.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
As soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
you realize that the real literary conceit is that --

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
is the idea that nature is opposed to culture,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
the idea that consciousness is everything --

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and that's another very important thing it does.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Looking at the world from other species' points of view

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
is a cure for the disease of human self-importance.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
You suddenly realize that consciousness --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
which we value and we consider

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
the crowning achievement of nature,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
But, you know, there's a comedian who said,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
"Well, who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Well, consciousness."

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and they're just as interesting.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I'll give you two examples, also from the garden:

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
lima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and summons another species of mite

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that comes in and attacks the spider mite, defending the lima bean.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So what plants have -- while we have consciousness, tool making, language,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
they have biochemistry.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Their complexity, their sophistication, is something to really marvel at,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and I think it's really the scandal of the Human Genome Project.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
You know, we went into it thinking, 40,000 or 50,000 human genes

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and we came out with only 23,000.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Just to give you grounds for comparison, rice: 35,000 genes.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So who's the more sophisticated species?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Well, we're all equally sophisticated.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
We've been evolving just as long,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
just along different paths.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So, cure for self-importance, way to sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And that's really what I do as a writer, as a storyteller,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
help us think ecologically.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Now, the other use of this is practical.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And I'm going to take you to a farm right now,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
to me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000
It is part of corn's scheme for world domination.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
(Laughter)

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and there will be that much more habitat

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
because we've decided ethanol is going to help us.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So it helped me understand industrial agriculture,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
which of course is a Cartesian system.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
It's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and that we are in charge, and that we create these factories

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
or the fuel or whatever we want.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Let me take you to a very different kind of farm.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I went looking for a farm where these ideas

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And that is this:

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
the farm is called Polyface, which means ...

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
the idea is he's got six different species of animals, as well as some plants,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
It's permaculture, those of you who know a little bit about this,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:17.000
such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ...

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
what else does he have?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
All the six different species -- rabbits, actually --

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
are all performing ecological services for one another,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and they take care of pests for one another.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It's a very elaborate and beautiful dance,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens, his laying hens.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And I'll show you, if you take this approach, what you get, OK?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see;

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
this is a different way to think about nature

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So, one day, cattle in a pen.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing:

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
relatively new, hooked to a car battery;

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock, set it up in 15 minutes.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Cows graze one day. They move, OK?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
They graze everything down, intensive grazing.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
He waits three days,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and then we towed in something called the Eggmobile.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards --

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but it houses 350 chickens.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
He tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
turns them down, and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
clucking, gossiping as chickens will --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and they make a beeline for the cow patties.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And what they're doing is very interesting:

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
they're digging through the cow patties

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
for the maggots, the grubs, the larvae of flies.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And the reason he's waited three days

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day, those larvae will hatch

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and he'll have a huge fly problem.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
But he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
because they are the chickens' favorite form of protein.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and in the process they're spreading the manure out.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Very useful second ecosystem service.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And third, while they're in this paddock

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
they are, of course, defecating madly

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
They then move out to the next one,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and in the course of just a few weeks, the grass just enters this blaze of growth.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And within four or five weeks, he can do it again.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
He can graze again, he can cut, he can bring in another species,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
like the lambs, or he can make hay for the winter.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Now, I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So, it's a very productive system.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And what I need to tell you is that on 100 acres

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
he gets 40,000 pounds of beef; 30,000 pounds of pork; 25,000 dozen eggs;

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
20,000 broilers; 1,000 turkeys; 1,000 rabbits --

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
an immense amount of food.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
You know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?"

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Well, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
again, give each species what it wants,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
let it realize its desires, its physiological distinctiveness.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Put that in play.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
But look at it from the point of view of the grass, now.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
What happens to the grass when you do this?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
When a ruminant grazes grass, the grass is cut from this height to this height,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and it immediately does something very interesting.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and plants need to keep the root mass

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
So when they lose a lot of leaf mass, they shed roots;

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
they kind of cauterize them and the roots die.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And the species in the soil go to work

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
basically chewing through those roots, decomposing them --

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
the earthworms, the fungi, the bacteria -- and the result is new soil.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
This is how soil is created.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
It's created from the bottom up.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
This is how the prairies were built,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
the relationship between bison and grasses.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And what I realized when I understood this --

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is, he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
he's not a sheep farmer, he's not a cattle rancher; he's a grass farmer,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
because grass is really the keystone species of such a system --

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:50.000
is that, if you think about it, this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
which is that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
More for us, less for nature.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Here, all this food comes off this farm, and at the end of the season

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
there is actually more soil, more fertility and more biodiversity.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
It's a remarkably hopeful thing to do.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
There are a lot of farmers doing this today.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
This is well beyond organic agriculture,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
which is still a Cartesian system, more or less.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000
take account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
-- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time --

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
that we can take the food we need from the Earth

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and actually heal the Earth in the process.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
This is a way to reanimate the world,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and that's what's so exciting about this perspective.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
When we really begin to feel Darwin's insights in our bones,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
are something to be very hopeful about.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Thank you very much.
