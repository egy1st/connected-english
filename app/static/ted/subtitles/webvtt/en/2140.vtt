WEBVTT

00:00:00.673 --> 00:00:03.055
Vision is the most important

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:05.643
and prioritized sense that we have.

00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:07.327
We are constantly looking

00:00:07.327 --> 00:00:09.101
at the world around us,

00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:11.298
and quickly we identify and make sense

00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:13.633
of what it is that we see.

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:15.552
Let's just start with an example

00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:16.825
of that very fact.

00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:18.835
I'm going to show you
a photograph of a person,

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:20.638
just for a second or two,

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:22.533
and I'd like for you to identify

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.672
what emotion is on his face.

00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:25.900
Ready?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.612
Here you go. Go with your gut reaction.

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.943
Okay. What did you see?

00:00:30.943 --> 00:00:33.207
Well, we actually surveyed

00:00:33.207 --> 00:00:35.514
over 120 individuals,

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:37.464
and the results were mixed.

00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:39.731
People did not agree

00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:42.621
on what emotion they saw on his face.

00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:44.426
Maybe you saw discomfort.

00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:46.415
That was the most frequent response

00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:47.670
that we received.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.759
But if you asked the person on your left,

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:52.500
they might have said regret or skepticism,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.429
and if you asked somebody on your right,

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.323
they might have said
something entirely different,

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.143
like hope or empathy.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:01.702
So we are all looking

00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:04.804
at the very same face again.

00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:06.232
We might see something

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.615
entirely different,

00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:11.679
because perception is subjective.

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:13.847
What we think we see

00:01:13.847 --> 00:01:15.289
is actually filtered

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.693
through our own mind's eye.

00:01:17.693 --> 00:01:19.946
Of course, there are many other examples

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:22.361
of how we see the world
through own mind's eye.

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:24.143
I'm going to give you just a few.

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:26.803
So dieters, for instance,

00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:28.821
see apples as larger

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:31.841
than people who are not counting calories.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.474
Softball players see the ball as smaller

00:01:35.474 --> 00:01:37.629
if they've just come out of a slump,

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:41.173
compared to people who 
had a hot night at the plate.

00:01:41.173 --> 00:01:44.123
And actually, our political beliefs also

00:01:44.123 --> 00:01:46.365
can affect the way we see other people,

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:48.538
including politicians.

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:52.231
So my research team and I
decided to test this question.

00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:55.862
In 2008, Barack Obama
was running for president

00:01:55.862 --> 00:01:57.261
for the very first time,

00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:00.243
and we surveyed hundreds of Americans

00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:02.466
one month before the election.

00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:04.165
What we found in this survey

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:06.451
was that some people, some Americans,

00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.147
think photographs like these

00:02:08.147 --> 00:02:11.139
best reflect how Obama really looks.

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.761
Of these people, 75 percent

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.628
voted for Obama in the actual election.

00:02:16.628 --> 00:02:19.796
Other people, though,
thought photographs like these

00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:22.085
best reflect how Obama really looks.

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:24.061
89 percent of these people

00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:25.882
voted for McCain.

00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:29.388
We presented many photographs of Obama

00:02:29.388 --> 00:02:30.985
one at a time,

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:33.884
so people did not realize
that what we were changing

00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:35.737
from one photograph to the next

00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:37.793
was whether we had artificially lightened

00:02:37.793 --> 00:02:40.341
or darkened his skin tone.

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:41.901
So how is that possible?

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:44.736
How could it be that
when I look at a person,

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:46.457
an object, or an event,

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:48.432
I see something very different

00:02:48.432 --> 00:02:50.261
than somebody else does?

00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:52.551
Well, the reasons are many,

00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:54.802
but one reason requires that we understand

00:02:54.802 --> 00:02:57.355
a little bit more about how our eyes work.

00:02:57.355 --> 00:02:59.364
So vision scientists know

00:02:59.364 --> 00:03:00.847
that the amount of information

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.718
that we can see

00:03:02.718 --> 00:03:04.557
at any given point in time,

00:03:04.557 --> 00:03:07.254
what we can focus on,
is actually relatively small.

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:09.983
What we can see with great sharpness

00:03:09.983 --> 00:03:12.160
and clarity and accuracy

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.147
is the equivalent

00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:16.323
of the surface area of our thumb

00:03:16.323 --> 00:03:18.618
on our outstretched arm.

00:03:18.618 --> 00:03:20.757
Everything else around that is blurry,

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:23.198
rendering much of what is presented

00:03:23.198 --> 00:03:25.842
to our eyes as ambiguous.

00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:28.116
But we have to clarify

00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:30.364
and make sense of what it is that we see,

00:03:30.364 --> 00:03:33.749
and it's our mind that
helps us fill in that gap.

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.318
As a result, perception
is a subjective experience,

00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:38.777
and that's how we end up seeing

00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:41.005
through our own mind's eye.

00:03:41.005 --> 00:03:42.818
So, I'm a social psychologist,

00:03:42.818 --> 00:03:44.335
and it's questions like these

00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:46.048
that really intrigue me.

00:03:46.048 --> 00:03:47.699
I am fascinated by those times

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.196
when people do not see eye to eye.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.893
Why is it that somebody might

00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:54.505
literally see the glass as half full,

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:55.985
and somebody literally sees it

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.456
as half empty?

00:03:57.456 --> 00:04:00.577
What is it about what one person
is thinking and feeling

00:04:00.577 --> 00:04:02.124
that leads them to see the world

00:04:02.124 --> 00:04:04.484
in an entirely different way?

00:04:04.484 --> 00:04:06.947
And does that even matter?

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:09.998
So to begin to tackle these questions,

00:04:09.998 --> 00:04:12.637
my research team and I
decided to delve deeply

00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:14.487
into an issue that has received

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.405
international attention:

00:04:16.405 --> 00:04:18.128
our health and fitness.

00:04:18.128 --> 00:04:19.486
Across the world,

00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:21.888
people are struggling
to manage their weight,

00:04:21.888 --> 00:04:24.102
and there is a variety of strategies

00:04:24.102 --> 00:04:27.459
that we have to help us
keep the pounds off.

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:30.565
For instance, we set
the best of intentions

00:04:30.565 --> 00:04:33.262
to exercise after the holidays,

00:04:33.262 --> 00:04:35.860
but actually, the majority of Americans

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.902
find that their New Year's resolutions

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.958
are broken by Valentine's Day.

00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.460
We talk to ourselves

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.154
in very encouraging ways,

00:04:44.154 --> 00:04:45.987
telling ourselves this is our year

00:04:45.987 --> 00:04:47.688
to get back into shape,

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:49.530
but that is not enough to bring us back

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.265
to our ideal weight.

00:04:51.265 --> 00:04:53.101
So why?

00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:55.184
Of course, there is no simple answer,

00:04:55.184 --> 00:04:57.947
but one reason, I argue,

00:04:57.947 --> 00:04:59.873
is that our mind's eye

00:04:59.873 --> 00:05:01.474
might work against us.

00:05:01.474 --> 00:05:04.493
Some people may literally see exercise

00:05:04.493 --> 00:05:06.159
as more difficult,

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:07.973
and some people might literally

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:10.280
see exercise as easier.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.028
So, as a first step
to testing these questions,

00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:16.291
we gathered objective measurements

00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:19.137
of individuals' physical fitness.

00:05:19.137 --> 00:05:21.479
We measured the 
circumference of their waist,

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.735
compared to the 
circumference of their hips.

00:05:24.735 --> 00:05:26.204
A higher waist-to-hip ratio

00:05:26.204 --> 00:05:28.387
is an indicator of being
less physically fit

00:05:28.387 --> 00:05:30.459
than a lower waist-to-hip ratio.

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:32.686
After gathering these measurements,

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:34.499
we told our participants that

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.083
they would walk to a finish line

00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:37.966
while carrying extra weight

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:39.123
in a sort of race.

00:05:39.123 --> 00:05:40.910
But before they did that,

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.350
we asked them to estimate the distance

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.037
to the finish line.

00:05:45.037 --> 00:05:47.333
We thought that the physical
states of their body

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:50.818
might change how
they perceived the distance.

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:52.578
So what did we find?

00:05:52.578 --> 00:05:55.286
Well, waist-to-hip ratio

00:05:55.286 --> 00:05:58.302
predicted perceptions of distance.

00:05:58.302 --> 00:06:00.932
People who were out of shape and unfit

00:06:00.932 --> 00:06:03.030
actually saw the distance
to the finish line

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.193
as significantly greater

00:06:04.193 --> 00:06:06.084
than people who were in better shape.

00:06:06.084 --> 00:06:08.125
People's states of their own body

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:11.361
changed how they
perceived the environment.

00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:13.477
But so too can our mind.

00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:15.386
In fact, our bodies and our minds

00:06:15.386 --> 00:06:17.363
work in tandem

00:06:17.363 --> 00:06:19.971
to change how we see the world around us.

00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:22.066
That led us to think that maybe people

00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:23.344
with strong motivations

00:06:23.344 --> 00:06:25.164
and strong goals to exercise

00:06:25.164 --> 00:06:28.336
might actually see
the finish line as closer

00:06:28.336 --> 00:06:32.036
than people who have weaker motivations.

00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:34.378
So to test whether motivations

00:06:34.378 --> 00:06:37.730
affect our perceptual
experiences in this way,

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.653
we conducted a second study.

00:06:39.653 --> 00:06:42.334
Again, we gathered objective measurements

00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:44.338
of people's physical fitness,

00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:46.396
measuring the circumference of their waist

00:06:46.396 --> 00:06:48.164
and the circumference of their hips,

00:06:48.164 --> 00:06:51.529
and we had them do a 
few other tests of fitness.

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:54.072
Based on feedback that we gave them,

00:06:54.072 --> 00:06:55.637
some of our participants told us

00:06:55.637 --> 00:06:57.945
they're not motivated
to exercise any more.

00:06:57.945 --> 00:07:00.339
They felt like they already
met their fitness goals

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:02.472
and they weren't going
to do anything else.

00:07:02.472 --> 00:07:04.091
These people were not motivated.

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.233
Other people, though, 
based on our feedback,

00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:08.518
told us they were highly 
motivated to exercise.

00:07:08.518 --> 00:07:11.230
They had a strong goal
to make it to the finish line.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.227
But again, before we had them
walk to the finish line,

00:07:14.227 --> 00:07:16.197
we had them estimate the distance.

00:07:16.197 --> 00:07:17.945
How far away was the finish line?

00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:20.307
And again, like the previous study,

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:22.141
we found that waist-to-hip ratio

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.101
predicted perceptions of distance.

00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:28.733
Unfit individuals saw
the distance as farther,

00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:30.703
saw the finish line as farther away,

00:07:30.703 --> 00:07:32.650
than people who were in better shape.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.659
Importantly, though, this only happened

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:36.593
for people who were not motivated

00:07:36.593 --> 00:07:38.212
to exercise.

00:07:38.212 --> 00:07:39.802
On the other hand,

00:07:39.802 --> 00:07:42.846
people who were highly
motivated to exercise

00:07:42.846 --> 00:07:45.043
saw the distance as short.

00:07:45.043 --> 00:07:47.370
Even the most out of shape individuals

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.928
saw the finish line

00:07:48.928 --> 00:07:50.432
as just as close,

00:07:50.432 --> 00:07:52.267
if not slightly closer,

00:07:52.267 --> 00:07:54.923
than people who were in better shape.

00:07:54.923 --> 00:07:56.882
So our bodies can change

00:07:56.882 --> 00:07:59.120
how far away that finish line looks,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.039
but people who had committed
to a manageable goal

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.148
that they could accomplish
in the near future

00:08:05.148 --> 00:08:07.342
and who believed that they were capable

00:08:07.342 --> 00:08:08.938
of meeting that goal

00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:12.354
actually saw the exercise as easier.

00:08:12.354 --> 00:08:14.264
That led us to wonder,

00:08:14.264 --> 00:08:16.681
is there a strategy that we could use

00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:19.071
and teach people that would help

00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:21.340
change their perceptions of the distance,

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.821
help them make exercise look easier?

00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:26.455
So we turned to
the vision science literature

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:28.201
to figure out what should we do,

00:08:28.201 --> 00:08:30.683
and based on what we read,
we came up with a strategy

00:08:30.683 --> 00:08:34.061
that we called, "Keep 
your eyes on the prize."

00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:35.872
So this is not the slogan

00:08:35.872 --> 00:08:37.757
from an inspirational poster.

00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:40.005
It's an actual directive

00:08:40.005 --> 00:08:42.927
for how to look around your environment.

00:08:42.927 --> 00:08:45.219
People that we trained in this strategy,

00:08:45.219 --> 00:08:49.093
we told them to focus
their attention on the finish line,

00:08:49.093 --> 00:08:50.929
to avoid looking around,

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:52.270
to imagine a spotlight

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.883
was shining on that goal,

00:08:53.893 --> 00:08:56.372
and that everything around it was blurry

00:08:56.372 --> 00:08:58.178
and perhaps difficult to see.

00:08:58.178 --> 00:09:00.349
We thought that this strategy

00:09:00.349 --> 00:09:02.842
would help make the exercise look easier.

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:04.461
We compared this group

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.119
to a baseline group.

00:09:06.119 --> 00:09:07.324
To this group we said,

00:09:07.324 --> 00:09:08.911
just look around the environment

00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:10.160
as you naturally would.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.720
You will notice the finish line,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.423
but you might also notice

00:09:13.423 --> 00:09:15.292
the garbage can off to the right,

00:09:15.292 --> 00:09:17.578
or the people and the 
lamp post off to the left.

00:09:17.578 --> 00:09:20.263
We thought that people
who used this strategy

00:09:20.263 --> 00:09:22.365
would see the distance as farther.

00:09:22.365 --> 00:09:24.812
So what did we find?

00:09:24.812 --> 00:09:26.785
When we had them estimate the distance,

00:09:26.785 --> 00:09:28.533
was this strategy successful

00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:31.033
for changing their perceptual experience?

00:09:31.033 --> 00:09:32.231
Yes.

00:09:32.231 --> 00:09:34.436
People who kept their eyes on the prize

00:09:34.436 --> 00:09:37.485
saw the finish line as 30 percent closer

00:09:37.485 --> 00:09:39.096
than people who looked around

00:09:39.096 --> 00:09:40.376
as they naturally would.

00:09:40.376 --> 00:09:41.684
We thought this was great.

00:09:41.684 --> 00:09:43.566
We were really excited because it meant

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:45.046
that this strategy helped make

00:09:45.046 --> 00:09:46.938
the exercise look easier,

00:09:46.938 --> 00:09:48.872
but the big question was,

00:09:48.872 --> 00:09:50.709
could this help make exercise

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:52.100
actually better?

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.765
Could it improve the quality

00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:55.646
of exercise as well?


00:09:55.646 --> 00:09:57.909
So next, we told our participants,

00:09:57.909 --> 00:09:59.804
you are going to walk to the finish line

00:09:59.804 --> 00:10:02.031
while wearing extra weight.

00:10:02.031 --> 00:10:04.051
We added weights to their ankles

00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.748
that amounted to 15 percent
of their body weight.

00:10:06.748 --> 00:10:08.696
We told them to lift their knees up high

00:10:08.696 --> 00:10:10.915
and walk to the finish line quickly.

00:10:10.915 --> 00:10:13.075
We designed this exercise in particular

00:10:13.075 --> 00:10:14.797
to be moderately challenging

00:10:14.797 --> 00:10:16.574
but not impossible,

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:17.834
like most exercises

00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:20.676
that actually improve our fitness.

00:10:20.676 --> 00:10:23.336
So the big question, then:

00:10:23.336 --> 00:10:25.448
Did keeping your eyes on the prize

00:10:25.448 --> 00:10:27.780
and narrowly focusing on the finish line

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.545
change their experience of the exercise?

00:10:30.545 --> 00:10:32.140
It did.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.375
People who kept their eyes on the prize

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:36.189
told us afterward that it required

00:10:36.189 --> 00:10:38.284
17 percent less exertion

00:10:38.284 --> 00:10:39.954
for them to do this exercise

00:10:39.954 --> 00:10:43.393
than people who looked around naturally.

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.457
It changed their subjective experience

00:10:45.457 --> 00:10:47.080
of the exercise.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.092
It also changed the objective nature

00:10:50.092 --> 00:10:51.391
of their exercise.

00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:53.639
People who kept their eyes on the prize

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:56.287
actually moved 23 percent faster

00:10:56.287 --> 00:10:59.735
than people who looked around naturally.

00:10:59.735 --> 00:11:01.417
To put that in perspective,

00:11:01.417 --> 00:11:03.090
a 23 percent increase

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.975
is like trading in your
1980 Chevy Citation

00:11:06.975 --> 00:11:11.619
for a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette.

00:11:11.619 --> 00:11:14.131
We were so excited by this,

00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:16.298
because this meant that a strategy

00:11:16.298 --> 00:11:17.980
that costs nothing,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.747
that is easy for people to use,

00:11:19.747 --> 00:11:21.718
regardless of whether they're in shape

00:11:21.718 --> 00:11:23.576
or struggling to get there,

00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:25.016
had a big effect.

00:11:25.016 --> 00:11:26.573
Keeping your eyes on the prize

00:11:26.573 --> 00:11:29.517
made the exercise look and feel easier

00:11:29.517 --> 00:11:32.075
even when people were working harder

00:11:32.075 --> 00:11:34.294
because they were moving faster.

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:37.264
Now, I know there's more to good health

00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:39.286
than walking a little bit faster,

00:11:39.286 --> 00:11:41.471
but keeping your eyes on the prize

00:11:41.471 --> 00:11:43.101
might be one additional strategy

00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:44.710
that you can use to help promote

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.025
a healthy lifestyle.

00:11:47.025 --> 00:11:49.106
If you're not convinced yet

00:11:49.106 --> 00:11:51.626
that we all see the world
through our own mind's eye,

00:11:51.626 --> 00:11:53.653
let me leave you with one final example.

00:11:53.653 --> 00:11:57.076
Here's a photograph of a beautiful 
street in Stockholm, with two cars.

00:11:57.076 --> 00:11:59.267
The car in the back looks much larger

00:11:59.267 --> 00:12:00.693
than the car in the front.

00:12:00.693 --> 00:12:02.299
However, in reality,

00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:04.678
these cars are the same size,

00:12:04.678 --> 00:12:07.573
but that's not how we see it.

00:12:07.573 --> 00:12:09.697
So does this mean that

00:12:09.697 --> 00:12:11.411
our eyes have gone haywire

00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:13.981
and that our brains are a mess?

00:12:13.981 --> 00:12:16.553
No, it doesn't mean that at all.

00:12:16.553 --> 00:12:18.574
It's just how our eyes work.

00:12:18.574 --> 00:12:21.263
We might see the world in a different way,

00:12:21.263 --> 00:12:23.035
and sometimes that might not

00:12:23.035 --> 00:12:25.101
line up with reality,

00:12:25.101 --> 00:12:27.226
but it doesn't mean
that one of us is right

00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:29.321
and one of us is wrong.

00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:31.457
We all see the world
through our mind's eye,

00:12:31.457 --> 00:12:34.308
but we can teach ourselves
to see it differently.

00:12:34.308 --> 00:12:36.132
So I can think of days

00:12:36.132 --> 00:12:38.166
that have gone horribly wrong for me.

00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:40.562
I'm fed up, I'm grumpy, I'm tired,

00:12:40.562 --> 00:12:42.102
and I'm so behind,

00:12:42.102 --> 00:12:44.508
and there's a big black cloud

00:12:44.508 --> 00:12:45.991
hanging over my head,

00:12:45.991 --> 00:12:47.425
and on days like these,

00:12:47.425 --> 00:12:49.300
it looks like everyone around me

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.434
is down in the dumps too.

00:12:51.434 --> 00:12:53.167
My colleague at work looks annoyed

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:55.877
when I ask for an extension on a deadline,

00:12:55.877 --> 00:12:57.855
and my friend looks frustrated

00:12:57.855 --> 00:13:00.554
when I show up late for lunch
because a meeting ran long,

00:13:00.554 --> 00:13:02.147
and at the end of the day,

00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:04.173
my husband looks disappointed

00:13:04.173 --> 00:13:06.706
because I'd rather go to 
bed than go to the movies.

00:13:06.706 --> 00:13:09.723
And on days like these,
when everybody looks

00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:11.731
upset and angry to me,

00:13:11.731 --> 00:13:14.949
I try to remind myself that there
are other ways of seeing them.

00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:18.259
Perhaps my colleague was confused,

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:20.695
perhaps my friend was concerned,

00:13:20.695 --> 00:13:23.962
and perhaps my husband was 
feeling empathy instead.

00:13:23.962 --> 00:13:25.856
So we all see the world

00:13:25.856 --> 00:13:27.682
through our own mind's eye,

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:29.685
and on some days, it might look

00:13:29.685 --> 00:13:31.093
like the world is a dangerous

00:13:31.093 --> 00:13:33.630
and challenging and insurmountable place,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.600
but it doesn't have to look
that way all the time.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.796
We can teach ourselves
to see it differently,

00:13:38.796 --> 00:13:41.462
and when we find a way to make the world

00:13:41.462 --> 00:13:43.399
look nicer and easier,

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:45.739
it might actually become so.

00:13:45.739 --> 00:13:47.294
Thank you.

00:13:47.294 --> 00:13:50.903
(Applause)
