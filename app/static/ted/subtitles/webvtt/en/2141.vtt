WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.876
Now, I'm an ethnobotanist.

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:04.121
That's a scientist who 
works in the rainforest

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.552
to document how people use local plants.

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:10.608
I've been doing this for a long time,

00:00:10.608 --> 00:00:12.377
and I want to tell you,

00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:15.344
these people know these forests
and these medicinal treasures

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:18.493
better than we do and
better than we ever will.

00:00:18.493 --> 00:00:20.801
But also, these cultures,

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:22.345
these indigenous cultures,

00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:27.024
are disappearing much faster
than the forests themselves.

00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:29.974
And the greatest and
most endangered species

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:31.778
in the Amazon Rainforest

00:00:31.778 --> 00:00:33.618
is not the jaguar,

00:00:33.618 --> 00:00:35.343
it's not the harpy eagle,

00:00:35.343 --> 00:00:39.164
it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes.

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:42.613
Now four years ago, I injured my 
foot in a climbing accident

00:00:42.613 --> 00:00:44.147
and I went to the doctor.

00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:45.741
She gave me heat,

00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:48.445
she gave me cold, aspirin,

00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:51.675
narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories,

00:00:51.675 --> 00:00:53.542
cortisone shots.

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:55.559
It didn't work.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.396
Several months later,

00:00:57.396 --> 00:00:59.613
I was in the northeast Amazon,

00:00:59.613 --> 00:01:01.606
walked into a village,

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:04.073
and the shaman said, "You're limping."

00:01:04.073 --> 00:01:06.632
And I'll never forget
this as long as I live.

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:08.466
He looked me in the face and he said,

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:12.382
"Take off your shoe and give 
me your machete."

00:01:12.382 --> 00:01:14.587
(Laughter)

00:01:14.587 --> 00:01:16.571
He walked over to a palm tree

00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:18.117
and carved off a fern,

00:01:18.117 --> 00:01:19.429
threw it in the fire,

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.121
applied it to my foot,

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:22.950
threw it in a pot of water,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.076
and had me drink the tea.

00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:28.518
The pain disappeared for seven months.

00:01:28.518 --> 00:01:30.444
When it came back, I went
to see the shaman again.

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:32.249
He gave me the same treatment,

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:35.999
and I've been cured for three years now.

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:38.671
Who would you rather be treated by?

00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:41.557
(Applause)

00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:43.785
Now, make no mistake — Western medicine

00:01:43.785 --> 00:01:46.895
is the most successful system
of healing ever devised,

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:49.470
but there's plenty of holes in it.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.508
Where's the cure for breast cancer?

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:53.378
Where's the cure for schizophrenia?

00:01:53.378 --> 00:01:55.772
Where's the cure for acid reflux?

00:01:55.772 --> 00:01:57.969
Where's the cure for insomnia?

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.888
The fact is that these people

00:01:59.888 --> 00:02:01.924
can sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

00:02:01.924 --> 00:02:03.570
cure things we cannot.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.952
Here you see a medicine man
in the northeast Amazon

00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:07.532
treating leishmaniasis,

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:09.863
a really nasty protozoal disease

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.824
that afflicts 12 million
people around the world.

00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:15.527
Western treatment are
injections of antimony.

00:02:15.527 --> 00:02:18.028
They're painful, they're expensive,

00:02:18.028 --> 00:02:20.139
and they're probably
not good for your heart;

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.779
it's a heavy metal.

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:25.397
This man cures it with three plants
from the Amazon Rainforest.

00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:27.712
This is the magic frog.

00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:30.448
My colleague, the late
great Loren McIntyre,

00:02:30.448 --> 00:02:32.612
discoverer of the source 
lake of the Amazon,

00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:35.056
Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes,

00:02:35.056 --> 00:02:38.161
was lost on the Peru-Brazil
border about 30 years ago.

00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:42.756
He was rescued by a group of 
isolated Indians called the Matsés.

00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:46.535
They beckoned for him to follow
them into the forest, which he did.

00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:48.959
There, they took out palm leaf baskets.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.441
There, they took out these
green monkey frogs —

00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:53.439
these are big suckers,
they're like this —

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.962
and they began licking them.

00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:58.930
It turns out, they're
highly hallucinogenic.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.832
McIntyre wrote about this and it was read 
by the editor of High Times magazine.

00:03:03.832 --> 00:03:08.183
You see that ethnobotanists have 
friends in all sorts of strange cultures.

00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:11.613
This guy decided he would go down
to the Amazon and give it a whirl,

00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:15.350
or give it a lick, and 
he did, and he wrote,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.835
"My blood pressure went through the roof,

00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:20.025
I lost full control of
my bodily functions,

00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:21.855
I passed out in a heap,

00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:24.381
I woke up in a hammock six hours later,

00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:26.555
felt like God for two days."

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:27.864
(Laughter)

00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:29.747
An Italian chemist read this and said,

00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:33.583
"I'm not really interested in the theological 
aspects of the green monkey frog.

00:03:33.583 --> 00:03:36.168
What's this about the
change in blood pressure?"

00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:38.572
Now, this is an Italian chemist

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:41.187
who's working on a new treatment
for high blood pressure

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:44.037
based on peptides in the skin
of the green monkey frog,

00:03:44.037 --> 00:03:46.319
and other scientists are looking

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.160
at a cure for drug-resistant Staph aureus.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.749
How ironic if these isolated 
Indians and their magic frog

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.858
prove to be one of the cures.

00:03:55.858 --> 00:03:58.047
Here's an ayahuasca shaman

00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:00.960
in the northwest Amazon, in
the middle of a yage ceremony.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.974
I took him to Los Angeles to
meet a foundation officer

00:04:03.974 --> 00:04:07.462
looking for support for monies
to protect their culture.

00:04:07.462 --> 00:04:10.060
This fellow looked at the
medicine man, and he said,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.207
"You didn't go to 
medical school, did you?"

00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:15.037
The shaman said, "No, I did not."

00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:17.668
He said, "Well, then what can
you know about healing?"

00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:19.432
The shaman looked at him and he said,

00:04:19.432 --> 00:04:23.248
"You know what? If you have 
an infection, go to a doctor.

00:04:23.248 --> 00:04:29.809
But many human afflictions are diseases 
of the heart, the mind and the spirit.

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:34.361
Western medicine can't 
touch those. I cure them."

00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:38.550
(Applause)

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.058
But all is not rosy in learning from
nature about new medicines.

00:04:42.058 --> 00:04:44.345
This is a viper from Brazil,

00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:47.603
the venom of which was studied at
the Universidade de São Paulo here.

00:04:47.603 --> 00:04:51.054
It was later developed
into ACE inhibitors.

00:04:51.054 --> 00:04:53.450
This is a frontline treatment
for hypertension.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.084
Hypertension causes over 10 percent

00:04:56.084 --> 00:04:58.458
of all deaths on the planet every day.

00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:00.542
This is a $4 billion industry

00:05:00.542 --> 00:05:02.734
based on venom from a Brazilian snake,

00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:06.068
and the Brazilians did not get a nickel.

00:05:06.068 --> 00:05:11.056
This is not an acceptable
way of doing business.

00:05:11.056 --> 00:05:14.670
The rainforest has been called the 
greatest expression of life on Earth.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.336
There's a saying in Suriname
that I dearly love:

00:05:17.336 --> 00:05:22.945
"The rainforests hold answers
to questions we have yet to ask."

00:05:22.945 --> 00:05:25.822
But as you all know,
it's rapidly disappearing.

00:05:25.822 --> 00:05:27.938
Here in Brazil, in the Amazon,

00:05:27.938 --> 00:05:29.335
around the world.

00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:31.505
I took this picture from a small plane

00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:34.453
flying over the eastern border
of the Xingu indigenous reserve

00:05:34.453 --> 00:05:37.502
in the state of Mato Grosso
to the northwest of here.

00:05:37.502 --> 00:05:39.155
The top half of the picture,

00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:40.857
you see where the Indians live.

00:05:40.857 --> 00:05:42.414
The line through the middle

00:05:42.414 --> 00:05:44.761
is the eastern border of the reserve.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:48.239
Top half Indians, bottom half white guys.

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:50.411
Top half wonder drugs,

00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:53.996
bottom half just a bunch
of skinny-ass cows.

00:05:53.996 --> 00:05:57.469
Top half carbon sequestered
in the forest where it belongs,

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:00.143
bottom half carbon in the atmosphere

00:06:00.143 --> 00:06:02.546
where it's driving climate change.

00:06:02.546 --> 00:06:05.034
In fact, the number two cause

00:06:05.034 --> 00:06:07.573
of carbon being released
into the atmosphere

00:06:07.573 --> 00:06:10.411
is forest destruction.

00:06:10.411 --> 00:06:12.227
But in talking about destruction,

00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:14.171
it's important to keep in mind

00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:18.174
that the Amazon is the mightiest
landscape of all.

00:06:18.174 --> 00:06:20.626
It's a place of beauty and wonder.

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:23.117
The biggest anteater in the world

00:06:23.117 --> 00:06:25.065
lives in the rain forest,

00:06:25.065 --> 00:06:27.468
tips the scale at 90 pounds.

00:06:27.468 --> 00:06:29.519
The goliath bird-eating spider

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:31.467
is the world's largest spider.

00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:33.768
It's found in the Amazon as well.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:37.656
The harpy eagle wingspan
is over seven feet.

00:06:37.656 --> 00:06:40.453
And the black cayman —

00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:43.509
these monsters can tip the
scale at over half a ton.

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.858
They're known to be man-eaters.

00:06:46.858 --> 00:06:49.648
The anaconda, the largest snake,

00:06:49.648 --> 00:06:52.375
the capybara, the largest rodent.

00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:54.037
A specimen from here in Brazil

00:06:54.037 --> 00:06:57.733
tipped the scale at 201 pounds.

00:06:57.733 --> 00:07:00.028
Let's visit where these creatures live,

00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:01.864
the northeast Amazon,

00:07:01.864 --> 00:07:03.563
home to the Akuriyo tribe.

00:07:03.563 --> 00:07:09.076
Uncontacted peoples hold a 
mystical and iconic role

00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:11.211
in our imagination.

00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:13.548
These are the people who 
know nature best.

00:07:13.548 --> 00:07:15.399
These are the people who truly live

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:18.457
in total harmony with nature.

00:07:18.457 --> 00:07:21.421
By our standards, some would
dismiss these people as primitive.

00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:23.062
"They don't know how to make fire,

00:07:23.062 --> 00:07:25.314
or they didn't when they
were first contacted."

00:07:25.314 --> 00:07:28.458
But they know the forest far
better than we do.

00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:31.452
The Akuriyos have 35 words for honey,

00:07:31.452 --> 00:07:33.502
and other Indians look up to them

00:07:33.502 --> 00:07:37.757
as being the true masters
of the emerald realm.

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:40.072
Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay.

00:07:40.072 --> 00:07:41.815
When I was a teenager rocking out

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:44.259
to the Rolling Stones in my
hometown of New Orleans,

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:46.794
Pohnay was a forest nomad

00:07:46.794 --> 00:07:49.291
roaming the jungles of
the northeast Amazon

00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:52.521
in a small band, looking for game,

00:07:52.531 --> 00:07:54.626
looking for medicinal plants,

00:07:54.626 --> 00:07:56.023
looking for a wife,

00:07:56.023 --> 00:07:58.301
in other small nomadic bands.

00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:00.779
But it's people like these

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:02.712
that know things that we don't,

00:08:02.712 --> 00:08:06.822
and they have lots of 
lessons to teach us.

00:08:06.832 --> 00:08:10.230
However, if you go into most of
the forests of the Amazon,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.037
there are no indigenous peoples.

00:08:12.037 --> 00:08:13.971
This is what you find:

00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:17.120
rock carvings which indigenous peoples,

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.550
uncontacted peoples, used to sharpen
the edge of the stone axe.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.622
These cultures that once danced,

00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:26.203
made love, sang to the gods,

00:08:26.203 --> 00:08:27.786
worshipped the forest,

00:08:27.786 --> 00:08:31.434
all that's left is an imprint in stone,
as you see here.

00:08:31.434 --> 00:08:34.004
Let's move to the western Amazon,

00:08:34.004 --> 00:08:37.091
which is really the epicenter
of isolated peoples.

00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:39.129
Each of these dots represents

00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:41.422
a small, uncontacted tribe,

00:08:41.422 --> 00:08:46.380
and the big reveal today is we believe
there are 14 or 15 isolated groups

00:08:46.381 --> 00:08:49.762
in the Colombian Amazon alone.

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:52.004
Why are these people isolated?

00:08:52.004 --> 00:08:54.711
They know we exist, they
know there's an outside world.

00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:56.731
This is a form of resistance.

00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:58.866
They have chosen to remain isolated,

00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:02.439
and I think it is their
human right to remain so.

00:09:02.439 --> 00:09:04.862
Why are these the tribes
that hide from man?

00:09:04.862 --> 00:09:05.967
Here's why.

00:09:05.967 --> 00:09:09.225
Obviously, some of this 
was set off in 1492.

00:09:09.225 --> 00:09:11.247
But at the turn of the last century

00:09:11.247 --> 00:09:13.072
was the rubber trade.

00:09:13.072 --> 00:09:14.722
The demand for natural rubber,

00:09:14.722 --> 00:09:16.628
which came from the Amazon,

00:09:16.628 --> 00:09:19.802
set off the botanical
equivalent of a gold rush.

00:09:19.802 --> 00:09:21.678
Rubber for bicycle tires,

00:09:21.678 --> 00:09:23.296
rubber for automobile tires,

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.047
rubber for zeppelins.

00:09:25.047 --> 00:09:28.054
It was a mad race to get that rubber,

00:09:28.054 --> 00:09:30.732
and the man on the left, Julio Arana,

00:09:30.732 --> 00:09:33.799
is one of the true thugs of the story.

00:09:33.799 --> 00:09:35.492
His people, his company,

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.594
and other companies like them

00:09:37.594 --> 00:09:40.749
killed, massacred, tortured,
butchered Indians

00:09:40.749 --> 00:09:45.656
like the Witotos you see on the
right hand side of the slide.

00:09:45.656 --> 00:09:48.081
Even today, when people
come out of the forest,

00:09:48.081 --> 00:09:50.786
the story seldom has a happy ending.

00:09:50.786 --> 00:09:53.906
These are Nukaks. They
were contacted in the '80s.

00:09:53.906 --> 00:09:57.863
Within a year, everybody over 40 was dead.

00:09:57.863 --> 00:10:00.095
And remember, these
are preliterate societies.

00:10:00.095 --> 00:10:01.875
The elders are the libraries.

00:10:01.875 --> 00:10:03.653
Every time a shaman dies,

00:10:03.653 --> 00:10:07.042
it's as if a library has burned down.

00:10:07.042 --> 00:10:09.538
They have been forced off their lands.

00:10:09.538 --> 00:10:13.761
The drug traffickers have
taken over the Nukak lands,

00:10:13.761 --> 00:10:15.739
and the Nukaks live as beggars

00:10:15.739 --> 00:10:18.981
in public parks in eastern Colombia.

00:10:18.981 --> 00:10:21.881
From the Nukak lands, I want to 
take you to the southwest,

00:10:21.881 --> 00:10:24.528
to the most spectacular 
landscape in the world:

00:10:24.528 --> 00:10:26.601
Chiribiquete National Park.

00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:28.740
It was surrounded by three isolated tribes

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.771
and thanks to the Colombian government
and Colombian colleagues,

00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:33.717
it has now expanded.

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:35.694
It's bigger than the state of Maryland.

00:10:35.694 --> 00:10:39.135
It is a treasure trove
of botanical diversity.

00:10:39.135 --> 00:10:42.090
It was first explored botanically in 1943

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.880
by my mentor, Richard Schultes,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.750
seen here atop the Bell Mountain,

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.185
the sacred mountains of the Karijonas.

00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:51.476
And let me show you
what it looks like today.

00:10:51.476 --> 00:10:53.405
Flying over Chiribiquete,

00:10:53.405 --> 00:10:55.983
realize that these lost world
mountains are still lost.

00:10:55.983 --> 00:10:57.788
No scientist has been atop them.

00:10:57.788 --> 00:10:59.981
In fact, nobody has been
atop the Bell Mountain

00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:01.940
since Schultes in '43.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.812
And we'll end up here
with the Bell Mountain

00:11:04.812 --> 00:11:07.070
just to the east of the picture.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.760
Let me show you what it looks like today.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.937
Not only is this a treasure
trove of botanical diversity,

00:11:12.937 --> 00:11:15.715
not only is it home to
three isolated tribes,

00:11:15.715 --> 00:11:17.503
but it's the greatest treasure trove

00:11:17.503 --> 00:11:20.828
of pre-Colombian art in the world:

00:11:20.828 --> 00:11:23.367
over 200,000 paintings.

00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:26.011
The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen

00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:31.697
described this as the Sistine Chapel
of the Amazon Rainforest.

00:11:31.697 --> 00:11:34.271
But move from Chiribiquete
down to the southeast,

00:11:34.271 --> 00:11:36.082
again in the Colombian Amazon.

00:11:36.082 --> 00:11:38.964
Remember, the Colombian Amazon
is bigger than New England.

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:40.581
The Amazon's a big forest,

00:11:40.581 --> 00:11:42.212
and Brazil's got a big part of it,

00:11:42.212 --> 00:11:43.698
but not all of it.

00:11:43.698 --> 00:11:45.286
Moving down to these two national parks,

00:11:45.286 --> 00:11:47.435
Cahuinari and Puré

00:11:47.435 --> 00:11:48.781
in the Colombian Amazon —

00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:51.469
that's the Brazilian
border to the right —

00:11:51.469 --> 00:11:53.843
it's home to several groups

00:11:53.843 --> 00:11:55.587
of isolated and uncontacted peoples.

00:11:55.587 --> 00:11:57.716
To the trained eye, you
can look at the roofs

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:59.807
of these malocas, these longhouses,

00:11:59.807 --> 00:12:01.728
and see that there's cultural diversity.

00:12:01.728 --> 00:12:03.776
These are, in fact, different tribes.

00:12:03.776 --> 00:12:06.340
As isolated as these areas are,

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.593
let me show you how the 
outside world is crowding in.

00:12:10.595 --> 00:12:13.316
Here we see trade and transport
increased in Putumayo.

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.756
With the diminishment of
the Civil War in Colombia,

00:12:15.756 --> 00:12:18.368
the outside world is showing up.

00:12:18.368 --> 00:12:21.120
To the north, we have illegal gold mining,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.812
also from the east, from Brazil.

00:12:22.812 --> 00:12:26.452
There's increased hunting and fishing
for commercial purposes.

00:12:26.452 --> 00:12:29.509
We see illegal logging
coming from the south,

00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:32.164
and drug runners are trying to
move through the park

00:12:32.164 --> 00:12:34.370
and get into Brazil.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.128
This, in the past, is why you didn't mess

00:12:37.128 --> 00:12:38.749
with isolated Indians.

00:12:38.749 --> 00:12:40.613
And if it looks like this
picture is out of focus

00:12:40.613 --> 00:12:43.899
because it was taken
in a hurry, here's why.

00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:46.416
(Laughter)

00:12:46.416 --> 00:12:52.303
This looks like — (Applause)

00:12:52.303 --> 00:12:54.823
This looks like a hangar
from the Brazilian Amazon.

00:12:54.823 --> 00:12:57.566
This is an art exhibit in Havana, Cuba.

00:12:57.566 --> 00:12:59.223
A group called Los Carpinteros.

00:12:59.223 --> 00:13:03.574
This is their perception of why you 
shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians.

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.551
But the world is changing.

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:08.319
These are Mashco-Piros
on the Brazil-Peru border

00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:10.460
who stumbled out of the jungle

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.414
because they were essentially chased out

00:13:12.414 --> 00:13:14.792
by drug runners and timber people.

00:13:14.792 --> 00:13:17.425
And in Peru, there's
a very nasty business.

00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:19.245
It's called human safaris.

00:13:19.245 --> 00:13:22.277
They will take you in to isolated
groups to take their picture.

00:13:22.277 --> 00:13:25.323
Of course, when you give them 
clothes, when you give them tools,

00:13:25.323 --> 00:13:27.221
you also give them diseases.

00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:30.068
We call these "inhuman safaris."

00:13:30.068 --> 00:13:32.166
These are Indians again 
on the Peru border,

00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:35.384
who were overflown by flights
sponsored by missionaries.

00:13:35.384 --> 00:13:38.315
They want to get in there
and turn them into Christians.

00:13:38.315 --> 00:13:40.510
We know how that turns out.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.284
What's to be done?

00:13:42.284 --> 00:13:44.710
Introduce technology
to the contacted tribes,

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.612
not the uncontacted tribes,

00:13:46.612 --> 00:13:49.745
in a culturally sensitive way.

00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:53.891
This is the perfect marriage of 
ancient shamanic wisdom

00:13:53.891 --> 00:13:56.717
and 21st century technology.

00:13:56.717 --> 00:13:59.728
We've done this now with over 30 tribes,

00:13:59.728 --> 00:14:02.652
mapped, managed and increased protection

00:14:02.652 --> 00:14:06.555
of over 70 million acres
of ancestral rainforest.

00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:11.828
(Applause)

00:14:11.828 --> 00:14:15.050
So this allows the Indians to take control

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:18.577
of their environmental
and cultural destiny.

00:14:18.577 --> 00:14:20.566
They also then set up guard houses

00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:22.572
to keep outsiders out.

00:14:22.572 --> 00:14:25.211
These are Indians, trained
as indigenous park rangers,

00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:26.867
patrolling the borders

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:29.948
and keeping the outside world at bay.

00:14:29.948 --> 00:14:32.707
This is a picture of actual contact.

00:14:32.707 --> 00:14:34.614
These are Chitonahua Indians

00:14:34.614 --> 00:14:36.617
on the Brazil-Peru border.

00:14:36.617 --> 00:14:38.321
They've come out of the jungle

00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:40.062
asking for help.

00:14:40.062 --> 00:14:41.468
They were shot at,

00:14:41.468 --> 00:14:44.205
their malocas, their 
longhouses, were burned.

00:14:44.205 --> 00:14:46.708
Some of them were massacred.

00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:52.494
Using automatic weapons to 
slaughter uncontacted peoples

00:14:52.494 --> 00:14:56.726
is the single most despicable and 
disgusting human rights abuse

00:14:56.726 --> 00:14:59.671
on our planet today, and it has to stop.

00:14:59.671 --> 00:15:06.205
(Applause)

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:08.928
But let me conclude by saying,

00:15:08.928 --> 00:15:11.792
this work can be spiritually rewarding,

00:15:11.792 --> 00:15:14.636
but it's difficult and
it can be dangerous.

00:15:14.636 --> 00:15:17.538
Two colleagues of mine
passed away recently

00:15:17.538 --> 00:15:19.903
in the crash of a small plane.

00:15:19.903 --> 00:15:21.681
They were serving the forest

00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:24.429
to protect those uncontacted tribes.

00:15:24.429 --> 00:15:26.366
So the question is, in conclusion,

00:15:26.366 --> 00:15:28.191
is what the future holds.

00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:30.288
These are the Uray people in Brazil.

00:15:30.288 --> 00:15:31.969
What does the future hold for them,

00:15:31.969 --> 00:15:34.640
and what does the future hold for us?

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.121
Let's think differently.

00:15:37.121 --> 00:15:38.918
Let's make a better world.

00:15:38.918 --> 00:15:40.836
If the climate's going to change,

00:15:40.836 --> 00:15:44.917
let's have a climate that changes for
the better rather than the worse.

00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:48.084
Let's live on a planet

00:15:48.084 --> 00:15:50.904
full of luxuriant vegetation,

00:15:50.904 --> 00:15:53.010
in which isolated peoples

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.869
can remain in isolation,

00:15:54.869 --> 00:15:56.842
can maintain that mystery

00:15:56.842 --> 00:15:58.368
and that knowledge

00:15:58.368 --> 00:16:00.013
if they so choose.

00:16:00.013 --> 00:16:02.128
Let's live in a world

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.497
where the shamans live in these forests

00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:07.441
and heal themselves and us

00:16:07.441 --> 00:16:10.178
with their mystical plants

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:12.235
and their sacred frogs.

00:16:12.235 --> 00:16:14.082
Thanks again.

00:16:14.082 --> 00:16:18.001
(Applause)
