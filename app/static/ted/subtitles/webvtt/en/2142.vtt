00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.543
I would like to start

00:00:02.543 --> 00:00:04.504
with the story of Mary,

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:07.495
a woman from an African village.

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:09.088
Her first memories

00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:11.940
are of her family fleeing violent riots

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.797
orchestrated by 
the ruling political party.

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:19.794
Her brother was murdered
by the state-sponsored militia,

00:00:19.794 --> 00:00:21.371
and she was raped more than once

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:25.580
just because she belonged
to the wrong party.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.743
One morning, a month before the election,

00:00:29.743 --> 00:00:33.464
Mary's village was called 
to another intimidation meeting.

00:00:33.464 --> 00:00:36.243
In this meeting, there is a man
standing in front of them,

00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:38.701
telling them, "We know who you are,

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:41.352
we know who you will vote for,

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:43.762
and if you're not going
to drop the right paper,

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:47.100
we're going to take revenge."

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.059
But for Mary, this meeting is different.

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.793
She feels different.

00:00:51.793 --> 00:00:54.430
This time, she's waiting for this meeting,

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.599
because this time, she's carrying
a small hidden camera in her dress,

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:01.655
a camera that nobody else can see.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:03.722
Nobody is allowed to film
in these meetings.

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:05.781
You risk your life if you do.

00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:10.179
Mary knows that, but she also knows
that the only way to stop them

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:13.751
and to protect herself and her community

00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:16.066
is to expose their intimidation,

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:20.048
to make sure they understand
somebody is following them,

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:23.738
to break the impunity they feel.

00:01:23.738 --> 00:01:27.724
Mary and her friends were filming
for months, undercover,

00:01:27.724 --> 00:01:31.491
the intimidation of
the ruling political party.

from doing what we want.

00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:47.694

Oren Yakobovich: These images
were broadcast all over the world,

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:43.183
but more importantly,

00:02:43.183 --> 00:02:46.336
they have been broadcast
back to the community.

00:02:46.336 --> 00:02:49.220
The perpetrators saw them too.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.461
They understood somebody
is following them.

00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:55.070
They got scared. Impunity was broken.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.156
Mary and her friends forced
the ruling political party

00:02:58.156 --> 00:03:00.406
not to use violence during the election,

00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:03.895
and saved hundreds of lives.

00:03:03.895 --> 00:03:06.402
Mary is just one of hundreds of people

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:09.962
that my organization had helped 
to document human rights violations

00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:12.862
using cameras.

00:03:12.862 --> 00:03:16.223
My background should have
led me to a different direction.

00:03:16.223 --> 00:03:19.472
I was born in Israel
to a right-wing family,

00:03:19.472 --> 00:03:21.378
and as long as I remember myself,

00:03:21.378 --> 00:03:24.473
I wanted to join the Israeli army
to serve my country

00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:28.924
and prove what I believed 
was our right for the whole land.

00:03:28.924 --> 00:03:34.204
I joined the Israeli army 
just after the first intifada,

00:03:34.204 --> 00:03:36.584
the first Palestinian uprising,

00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:38.492
and I served in one of the hard-minded,

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:42.012
toughest, aggressive infantry units,

00:03:42.012 --> 00:03:46.971
and I got the biggest gun in my platoon.

00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:49.431
Quite fast, I became an officer

00:03:49.431 --> 00:03:52.422
and got soldiers under my command,

00:03:52.422 --> 00:03:55.347
and as time passed, I started
serving in the West Bank,

00:03:55.347 --> 00:03:58.203
and I saw these images.

00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:08.077
I didn't like what I saw.

00:04:08.077 --> 00:04:09.496
It took me a while,

00:04:09.496 --> 00:04:12.738
but eventually I refused
to serve in the West Bank

00:04:12.738 --> 00:04:15.594
and had to spend time in jail.

00:04:15.594 --> 00:04:16.754
It was a bit —

00:04:16.754 --> 00:04:19.730
(Applause) —

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.422
It was not that bad, I have to say.

00:04:21.422 --> 00:04:24.505
It was a bit like being in a hotel,
but with very shitty food.

00:04:24.505 --> 00:04:26.170
(Laughter)

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.042
In jail, I kept thinking 
that I need people to know.

00:04:30.042 --> 00:04:31.708
I need people to understand

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:34.564
what the reality
in the West Bank looks like.

00:04:34.564 --> 00:04:37.002
I need them to hear what I heard,

00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:38.906
I need them to see what I saw,

00:04:38.906 --> 00:04:42.244
but I also understood, we need 
the Palestinians themselves,

00:04:42.244 --> 00:04:43.733
the people that are suffering,

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:45.965
to be able to tell their own stories,

00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:51.576
not journalists or filmmakers
that are coming outside of the situation.

00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:54.649
I joined a human rights organization,

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:57.789
an Israeli human rights 
organization called B'Tselem.

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.864
Together, we analyzed the West Bank

00:04:59.864 --> 00:05:03.789
and picked 100 families that
are living in the most risky places:

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.604
close to checkpoints, near army bases,

00:05:07.604 --> 00:05:10.059
side by side with settlers.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:13.901
We gave them cameras and training.

00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:18.231
Quite fast, we started getting
very disturbing images

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:23.213
about how the settlers 
and the soldiers are abusing them.

00:05:23.213 --> 00:05:26.333
I would like to share with you
two clips from this project.

00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:30.478
Both of them were broadcast in Israel,
and it created a massive debate.

00:05:30.478 --> 00:05:31.770
And I have to warn you,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.030
some of you might 
find them quite explicit.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.454
The masked men you 
will see in the first clips

00:05:37.454 --> 00:05:39.184
are Jewish settlers.

00:05:39.184 --> 00:05:41.670
Minutes before the camera was turned on,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.548
they approached a Palestinian family

00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:45.360
that was working their land

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.567
and told them that they
have to leave the land,

00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:50.119
because this land belongs
to the Jewish settlers.

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:52.046
The Palestinians refused.

00:05:52.046 --> 00:05:55.109
Let's see what happened.

00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:58.925
The masked men that are approaching
are Jewish settlers.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:04.259
They are approaching
the Palestinian family.

00:06:21.087 --> 00:06:23.461
This is a demonstration in the West Bank.

00:06:23.461 --> 00:06:25.063
The guy in green is Palestinian.

00:06:25.063 --> 00:06:27.873
He will be arrested in a second.

00:06:27.873 --> 00:06:30.706
Here you see him
blindfolded and handcuffed.

00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:34.362
In a few seconds, he regrets 
he came to this demonstration.

00:06:37.824 --> 00:06:42.070
He's been shot in the foot
with a rubber bullet.

00:06:43.256 --> 00:06:45.642
He is okay.

00:06:48.242 --> 00:06:52.813
Not all the settlers and the soldiers
are acting this way.

00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:57.058
We're talking about a tiny minority,
but they have to be brought to justice.

00:06:57.058 --> 00:06:59.311
These clips, and others like them,

00:06:59.311 --> 00:07:02.709
forced the army and the police
to start investigations.

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:04.963
They've been shown in Israel, of course,

00:07:04.963 --> 00:07:07.509
and the Israeli public
was exposed to them also.

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:11.107
This project redefined
the struggle for human rights

00:07:11.107 --> 00:07:12.708
in the occupied territories,

00:07:12.708 --> 00:07:17.591
and we managed to reduce the number 
of violent attacks in the West Bank.

00:07:20.517 --> 00:07:22.716
The success of this project
got me thinking

00:07:22.716 --> 00:07:26.297
how I can take the same methodology
to other places in the world.

00:07:26.306 --> 00:07:28.016
Now, we tend to believe that today,

00:07:28.016 --> 00:07:29.722
with all of the technology,

00:07:29.722 --> 00:07:31.352
the smartphones and the Internet,

00:07:31.352 --> 00:07:34.748
we are able to see and understand
most of what's happening in the world,

00:07:34.748 --> 00:07:36.897
and people are able to tell their story —

00:07:36.897 --> 00:07:38.796
but it's only partly true.

00:07:38.796 --> 00:07:41.794
Still today, with all
the technology we have,

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:44.202
less than half of the world's population

00:07:44.202 --> 00:07:46.478
has access to the Internet,

00:07:46.478 --> 00:07:49.025
and more than three billion people —

00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:50.589
I'm repeating the number —

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:56.891
three billion people are consuming news
that is censored by those in power.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.419
More or less around the same time,

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:03.537
I'm approached by a great guy
named Uri Fruchtmann.

00:08:03.537 --> 00:08:05.893
He's a filmmaker and an activist.

00:08:05.893 --> 00:08:08.469
We understood we were
thinking along the same lines,

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:14.658
and we decided to establish Videre,
our organization, together.

00:08:14.658 --> 00:08:17.522
While building the organization in London,

00:08:17.522 --> 00:08:19.594
we've been traveling undercover to places

00:08:19.594 --> 00:08:21.781
where a community 
was suffering from abuses,

00:08:21.781 --> 00:08:24.449
where mass atrocities were happening,

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:27.326
and there was a lack of reporting.

00:08:27.326 --> 00:08:31.121
We tried to understand how we can help.

00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:33.790
There were four things that I learned.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.250
The first thing is that we have to engage

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.409
with communities that are
living in rural areas,

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.814
where violations are happening
far from the public eye.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.645
We need to partner with them,

00:08:44.645 --> 00:08:48.566
and we need to understand which images
are not making it out there

00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:51.474
and help them to document them.

00:08:51.824 --> 00:08:53.642
The second thing I learned

00:08:53.642 --> 00:08:57.424
is that we have to enable them 
to film in a safe way.

00:08:57.424 --> 00:09:01.803
Security has to be the priority.

00:09:01.803 --> 00:09:04.006
Where I used to work before,
in the West Bank,

00:09:04.006 --> 00:09:05.646
one can take a camera out,

00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:08.339
most likely not going to get shot,

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:09.884
but in places we wanted to work,

00:09:09.884 --> 00:09:15.094
just try to pull a phone out,
and you're dead — literally dead.

00:09:15.094 --> 00:09:16.624
This is why we decided

00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:18.568
to take the operation undercover

00:09:18.568 --> 00:09:19.995
when necessary,

00:09:19.995 --> 00:09:22.026
and use mostly hidden cameras.

00:09:22.026 --> 00:09:25.403
Unfortunately, I can't show you
the hidden cameras we're using today —

00:09:25.403 --> 00:09:26.845
for obvious reasons —

00:09:26.845 --> 00:09:29.097
but these are cameras we used before.

00:09:29.097 --> 00:09:31.187
You can buy them off the shelf.

00:09:31.187 --> 00:09:34.786
Today, we're building 
a custom-made hidden camera,

00:09:34.786 --> 00:09:36.648
like the one that Mary was wearing

00:09:36.648 --> 00:09:38.942
in her dress to film
the intimidation meeting

00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:40.954
of the ruling political party.

00:09:40.954 --> 00:09:42.796
It's a camera that nobody can see,

00:09:42.796 --> 00:09:45.745
that blends into the environment,

00:09:45.745 --> 00:09:47.824
into the surroundings.

00:09:47.824 --> 00:09:51.272
Now, filming securities go beyond
using hidden cameras.

00:09:51.272 --> 00:09:56.162
Being secure starts way before
the activist is turning the camera on.

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:58.214
To keep our partners safe,

00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:00.966
we work to understand
the risk of every location

00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:03.647
and of every shot before it's happened,

00:10:03.647 --> 00:10:06.549
building a backup plan
if something goes wrong,

00:10:06.549 --> 00:10:08.941
and making sure 
we have everything in place

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.892
before our operations start.

00:10:11.892 --> 00:10:15.707
The third thing I learned
is the importance of verification.

00:10:15.707 --> 00:10:18.311
You can have an amazing shot of atrocity,

00:10:18.311 --> 00:10:22.079
but if you can't verify it,
it's worth nothing.

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:25.562
Recently, like in the ongoing war 
in Syria or the war in Gaza,

00:10:25.562 --> 00:10:30.875
we've seen images that are staged 
or brought from a different conflict.

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:33.828
This misinformation destroyed
the credibility of the source,

00:10:33.828 --> 00:10:38.608
and it's harmed the credibility of other
reliable and trustworthy sources.

00:10:38.608 --> 00:10:42.611
We use a variety of ways to make sure
we can verify the information

00:10:42.611 --> 00:10:44.559
and we can trust the material.

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:46.432
It starts with vetting the partners,

00:10:46.432 --> 00:10:49.645
understanding who they are,
and working with them very intensively.

00:10:49.645 --> 00:10:51.780
How do you film a location?

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.614
You film road signs, you film watches,

00:10:53.614 --> 00:10:54.956
you film newspapers.

00:10:54.956 --> 00:10:59.442
We are checking maps, looking at maps,

00:10:59.442 --> 00:11:01.695
double-checking the information,

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:06.078
and looking also at 
the metadata of the material.

00:11:06.078 --> 00:11:09.197
Now, the fourth and the most
important thing I learned

00:11:09.197 --> 00:11:13.466
is how you use images 
to create a positive change.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.299
To have an effect,

00:11:16.299 --> 00:11:20.886
the key thing is how you use the material.

00:11:20.886 --> 00:11:23.404
Today, we're working
with hundreds of activists

00:11:23.404 --> 00:11:24.953
filming undercover.

00:11:24.953 --> 00:11:28.055
We work with them both to understand 
the situation on the ground

00:11:28.055 --> 00:11:31.045
and which images 
are missing to describe it,

00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:35.979
who are the ones that are 
influencing the situation,

00:11:35.979 --> 00:11:40.036
and when to release the material
to advance the struggle.

00:11:40.036 --> 00:11:42.473
Sometimes, it's about
putting it in the media,

00:11:42.473 --> 00:11:44.399
mostly local ones, to create awareness.

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.835
Sometimes it's working
with decision makers,

00:11:46.835 --> 00:11:48.009
to change laws.

00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:52.535
Sometimes, it's working with lawyers
to use as evidence in court.

00:11:52.535 --> 00:11:54.053
But more than often,

00:11:54.053 --> 00:11:58.011
the most effective way
to create a social change

00:11:58.011 --> 00:12:00.342
is to work within the community.

00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:02.575
I want to give you one example.

00:12:02.575 --> 00:12:08.351
Fatuma is part of a network of women
that are fighting abuses in Kenya.

00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:11.282
Women in her community
have been harassed constantly

00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:14.157
on their way to school
and on their way to work.

00:12:14.157 --> 00:12:17.854
They are trying to change 
the behavior of the community from inside.

00:12:17.854 --> 00:12:20.384
In the next clip,

00:12:20.384 --> 00:12:24.649
Fatuma is taking us with her
on her journey to work.

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:28.553
Her voice is superimposed
on images that she filmed herself

00:12:28.557 --> 00:12:31.095
using hidden cameras.

00:12:31.095 --> 00:12:33.572
(Video) Fatuma Chiusiku: 
My name is Fatuma Chiusiku.

00:12:33.572 --> 00:12:35.824
I'm 32 years old, a mother,

00:12:35.824 --> 00:12:39.439
And Ziwa La Ng'Ombe is my home.

00:12:39.439 --> 00:12:41.652
Each morning, I ride the mini-bus

00:12:41.652 --> 00:12:44.009
Number 11.

00:12:44.009 --> 00:12:47.062
But instead of a peaceful journey to work,

00:12:47.062 --> 00:12:50.491
each day begins with fear.

00:12:50.491 --> 00:12:51.991
Come with me now

00:12:51.991 --> 00:12:53.796
and use my eyes

00:12:53.796 --> 00:12:59.569
to feel what I feel.

00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:01.714
As I walk, I think to myself:

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:03.385
Will I be touched?

00:13:03.385 --> 00:13:04.650
Grabbed?

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.114
Violated by this conductor again?

00:13:08.114 --> 00:13:10.207
Even the men inside

00:13:10.207 --> 00:13:12.350
the way they look at me

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.666
touch my body, rub against me,

00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:16.619
grab me,

00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:18.892
and now, as I sit in my seat

00:13:18.892 --> 00:13:21.734
I only wish my mind was full
of thoughts for my day,

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:23.350
my dreams, my children at school,

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.617
but instead I worry about
the moment when we will arrive

00:13:27.617 --> 00:13:32.785
and I will be violated again.

00:13:32.785 --> 00:13:38.150
OY: Today, there is a new front
in the fight for human rights.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.695
I used to carry a big gun.

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.868
Now, I am carrying this.

00:13:43.868 --> 00:13:50.298
This is a much more powerful
and much, much more effective weapon.

00:13:50.298 --> 00:13:54.429
But we have to use its power wisely.

00:13:54.429 --> 00:13:59.793
By putting the right images
in the right hands at the right time,

00:13:59.793 --> 00:14:02.585
we can truly create an impact.

00:14:02.585 --> 00:14:04.819
Thank you.

00:14:04.819 --> 00:14:13.244
(Applause)

00:14:13.244 --> 00:14:15.848
Thank you.

00:14:15.848 --> 00:14:18.611
(Applause)
