00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:03.089
Ten years ago,

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.897
I got a phone call that
changed my life.

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:10.849
At the time, I was 
cardiologist at UCLA,

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.286
specializing in cardiac 
imaging techniques.

00:00:14.286 --> 00:00:19.815
The call came from a veterinarian
at the Los Angeles Zoo.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:22.469
An elderly female chimpanzee

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:25.292
had woken up with a facial droop

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.628
and the veterinarians were worried
that she'd had a stroke.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.653
They asked if I'd 
come to the zoo

00:00:31.653 --> 00:00:33.601
and image the animal's heart

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.291
to look for a possible
cardiac cause.

00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:40.929
Now, to be clear, North American
zoos are staffed

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:45.058
by highly qualified, 
board-certified veterinarians

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:49.727
who take outstanding 
care of their animal patients.

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:53.813
But occasionally, they do reach into 
the human medical community,

00:00:53.813 --> 00:00:58.414
particularly for some 
speciality consultation,

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:04.233
and I was one of the lucky physicians
who was invited in to help.

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:10.736
I had a chance to rule out
a stroke in this chimpanzee

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:16.800
and make sure that this gorilla 
didn't have a torn aorta,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.587
evaluate this macaw
for a heart murmur,

00:01:21.587 --> 00:01:29.056
make sure that this California sea lion's
paricardium wasn't inflamed,

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:33.314
and in this picture, I'm listening
to the heart of a lion

00:01:33.314 --> 00:01:36.931
after a lifesaving, 
collaborative procedure

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.848
with veterinarians and physicians

00:01:39.848 --> 00:01:44.165
where we drained 700 cc's of 
fluid from the sac

00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:48.569
in which this lion's 
heart was contained.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.382
And this procedure, which I have
done on many human patients,

00:01:53.382 --> 00:02:02.733
was identical, with the exception
of that paw and that tail.

00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:09.124
Now most of the time, I was working
at UCLA Medical Center with physicians,

00:02:09.124 --> 00:02:14.158
discussing symptoms
and diagnoses and treatments

00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:17.599
for my human patients,

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.677
but some of the time,
I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo

00:02:20.677 --> 00:02:26.122
with veterinarians, discussing 
symptoms and diagnoses and treatments

00:02:26.122 --> 00:02:28.748
for their animal patients.

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:33.841
And occasionally, on 
the very same day,

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:37.620
I went on rounds at 
UCLA Medical Center

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.523
and at the Los Angeles Zoo.

00:02:40.523 --> 00:02:46.861
And here's what started coming
into very clear focus for me.

00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:51.167
Physicians and veterinarians
were essentially taking care

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:56.337
of the same disorders in their 
animal and human patients:

00:02:56.337 --> 00:03:00.850
congestive heart failure, brain tumors,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:09.101
leukemia, diabetes, 
arthritis, ALS, breast cancer,

00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:14.241
even psychiatric syndromes
like depression, anxiety,

00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:20.788
compulsions, eating disorders
and self-injury.

00:03:20.788 --> 00:03:23.666
Now, I've got a confession to make.

00:03:23.666 --> 00:03:30.515
Even though I studied comparative
physiology and evolutionary biology

00:03:30.515 --> 00:03:32.598
as an undergrad --

00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:37.136
I had even written my senior 
thesis on Darwinian theory --

00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:39.856
learning about the 
significant overlap

00:03:39.856 --> 00:03:42.592
between the disorders of 
animals and humans,

00:03:42.592 --> 00:03:48.311
it came as a much needed 
wake-up call for me.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:52.799
So I started wondering,
with all of these overlaps,

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.317
how was it that I had never
thought to ask a veterinarian,

00:03:58.317 --> 00:04:00.844
or consult the veterinary literature,

00:04:00.844 --> 00:04:05.173
for insights into one 
of my human patients?

00:04:05.173 --> 00:04:11.324
Why had I never, nor had any of my 
physician friends and colleagues

00:04:11.324 --> 00:04:16.667
whom I asked, ever attended 
a veterinary conference?

00:04:18.327 --> 00:04:24.443
For that matter, why was 
any of this a surprise?

00:04:24.443 --> 00:04:30.588
I mean, look, every single physician
accepts some biological connection

00:04:30.588 --> 00:04:33.488
between animals and humans.

00:04:33.488 --> 00:04:38.257
Every medication that we prescribe
or that we've taken ourselves

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:40.891
or we've given to our families


00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:44.471
has first been tested on an animal.

00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:46.227
But there's something very different

00:04:46.227 --> 00:04:52.832
about giving an animal a 
medication or a human disease

00:04:52.832 --> 00:04:56.777
and the animal developing 
congestive heart failure

00:04:56.777 --> 00:05:03.324
or diabetes or breast cancer 
on their own.

00:05:03.324 --> 00:05:05.955
Now, maybe some of the surprise

00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:09.539
comes from the increasing
separation in our world

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.423
between the urban and the nonurban.

00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:16.121
You know, we hear about these city kids

00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:20.192
who think that wool grows on trees

00:05:20.192 --> 00:05:24.256
or that cheese comes from a plant.

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:26.989
Well, today's human hospitals,

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:33.800
increasingly, are turning into these
gleaming cathedrals of technology.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.717
And this creates a psychological
distance between the human patients

00:05:38.717 --> 00:05:41.437
who are being treated there

00:05:41.437 --> 00:05:45.934
and animal patients who
are living in oceans

00:05:45.934 --> 00:05:49.452
and farms and jungles.

00:05:49.452 --> 00:05:54.561
But I think there's an 
even deeper reason.

00:05:54.561 --> 00:06:01.294
Physicians and scientists, we accept
intellectually that our species,

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:05.035
Homo sapiens, is merely 
one species,

00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:10.506
no more unique or
special than any other.

00:06:10.506 --> 00:06:15.522
But in our hearts, we don't 
completely believe that.

00:06:16.572 --> 00:06:20.866
I feel it myself when I'm 
listening to Mozart

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:26.266
or looking at pictures of the 
Mars Rover on my MacBook.

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:31.812
I feel that tug of 
human exceptionalism,

00:06:31.812 --> 00:06:36.370
even as I recognize the 
scientifically isolating cost

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.746
of seeing ourselves as a
superior species, apart.

00:06:42.746 --> 00:06:45.979
Well, I'm trying these days.

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:50.441
When I see a human patient
now, I always ask,

00:06:50.441 --> 00:06:55.283
what do the animal doctors know
about this problem that I don't know?

00:06:55.283 --> 00:07:00.745
And, might I be taking better 
care of my human patient

00:07:00.745 --> 00:07:05.918
if I saw them as a human
animal patient?

00:07:07.858 --> 00:07:12.095
Here are a few examples of the 
kind of exciting connections


00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:16.057
that this kind of 
thinking has led me to.

00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:18.894
Fear-induced heart failure.

00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:21.398
Around the year 2000,

00:07:21.398 --> 00:07:28.898
human cardiologists "discovered"
emotionally induced heart failure.

00:07:28.898 --> 00:07:34.000
It was described in a gambling father 
who had lost his life's savings

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.152
with a roll of the dice,

00:07:37.152 --> 00:07:41.823
in a bride who'd
been left at the alter.

00:07:41.823 --> 00:07:46.464
But it turns out, this 
"new" human diagnosis

00:07:46.464 --> 00:07:50.939
was neither new, nor
was it uniquely human.

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:56.867
Veterinarians had been diagnosing, 
treating and even preventing

00:07:56.867 --> 00:08:00.746
emotionally induced
symptoms in animals

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:06.650
ranging from monkeys to flamingos,
from to deer to rabbits,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.708
since the 1970s.

00:08:10.968 --> 00:08:14.334
How many human lives 
might have been saved

00:08:14.334 --> 00:08:17.939
if this veterinary knowledge
had been put into the hands

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:21.845
of E.R. docs and cardiologists?

00:08:23.055 --> 00:08:25.517
Self-injury.

00:08:25.517 --> 00:08:29.652
Some human patients 
harm themselves.

00:08:29.652 --> 00:08:33.352
Some pluck out patches of hair,

00:08:33.352 --> 00:08:36.452
others actually cut themselves.

00:08:38.242 --> 00:08:42.064
Some animal patients 
also harm themselves.

00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:45.544
There are birds that 
pluck out feathers.

00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:53.313
There are stallions that repetitively
bite their flanks until they bleed.

00:08:53.313 --> 00:08:58.485
But veterinarians have very specific
and very effective ways

00:08:58.485 --> 00:09:02.904
of treating and even
preventing self-injury

00:09:02.904 --> 00:09:06.686
in their self-injuring animals.

00:09:06.686 --> 00:09:09.733
Shouldn't this veterinary knowledge
be put into the hands

00:09:09.733 --> 00:09:13.459
of psychotherapists and 
parents and patients

00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:16.437
struggling with self-injury?

00:09:17.497 --> 00:09:22.332
Postpartum depression and 
postpartum psychosis.

00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:25.467
Sometimes, soon after giving birth,

00:09:25.467 --> 00:09:27.891
some women become depressed,

00:09:27.891 --> 00:09:32.197
and sometimes they become seriously 
depressed and even psychotic.

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:34.761
They may neglect their newborn,

00:09:34.761 --> 00:09:36.937
and in some extreme cases,

00:09:36.937 --> 00:09:40.086
even harm the child.

00:09:40.086 --> 00:09:44.312
Equine veterinarians also
know that occasionally,

00:09:44.312 --> 00:09:47.433
a mare, soon after giving birth,

00:09:47.433 --> 00:09:50.646
will neglect the foal,
refusing to nurse,

00:09:50.646 --> 00:09:55.718
and in some instances,
kick the foal, even to death.

00:09:57.018 --> 00:09:59.823
But veterinarians have devised

00:09:59.823 --> 00:10:05.296
an intervention to deal with
this foal rejection syndrome

00:10:05.296 --> 00:10:09.561
that involves increasing 
oxytocin in the mare.

00:10:09.561 --> 00:10:12.946
Oxytocin is the bonding hormone,

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.635
and this leads to renewed interest,

00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:19.065
on the part of the mare, in her foal.

00:10:19.065 --> 00:10:21.121
Shouldn't this information

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:24.461
be put into the hands of ob/gyn's

00:10:24.461 --> 00:10:27.794
and family doctors and patients

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:33.156
who are struggling with postpartum
depression and psychosis?

00:10:35.306 --> 00:10:37.653
Well, despite all of this promise,

00:10:37.653 --> 00:10:45.461
unfortunately the gulf between
our fields remains large.

00:10:45.461 --> 00:10:50.990
To explain it, I'm afraid I'm going 
to have to air some dirty laundry.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:55.095
Some physicians can be real snobs

00:10:55.095 --> 00:10:57.649
about doctors who are not M.D.'s.

00:10:57.649 --> 00:11:03.975
I'm talking about dentists and 
optometrists and psychologists,

00:11:03.975 --> 00:11:08.202
but maybe especially animal doctors.

00:11:08.202 --> 00:11:12.075
Of course, most physicians
don't realize that it is harder

00:11:12.075 --> 00:11:16.458
to get into vet school these
days than medical school,

00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:18.742
and that when we go 
to medical school,

00:11:18.742 --> 00:11:21.355
we learn everything 
there is to know

00:11:21.355 --> 00:11:24.478
about one species, Homo sapiens,

00:11:24.478 --> 00:11:28.785
but veterinarians need to learn
about health and disease

00:11:28.785 --> 00:11:33.763
in mammals, amphibians,
reptiles, fish and birds.

00:11:33.763 --> 00:11:38.447
So I don't blame the vets
for feeling annoyed

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:44.412
by my profession's
condescension and ignorance.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:47.152
But here's one from the vets:

00:11:47.152 --> 00:11:50.559
What do you call a veterinarian

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:56.416
who can only take 
care of one species?

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:59.737
A physician. (Laughter)

00:11:59.737 --> 00:12:05.946
Closing the gap has become 
a passion for me,

00:12:05.946 --> 00:12:08.547
and I'm doing this 
through programs

00:12:08.547 --> 00:12:11.689
like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA,

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:17.236
where we're bringing animal experts 
and evolutionary biologists

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:21.388
and embedding them
on our medical teams

00:12:21.388 --> 00:12:25.326
with our interns and our residents.

00:12:25.326 --> 00:12:29.033
And through Zoobiquity conferences,

00:12:29.033 --> 00:12:33.252
where we bring medical schools 
together with veterinary schools

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:35.392
for collabortive discussions

00:12:35.392 --> 00:12:38.193
of the shared diseases and disorders


00:12:38.193 --> 00:12:42.319
of animal and human patients.

00:12:42.319 --> 00:12:45.162
At Zoobiquity conferences,

00:12:45.162 --> 00:12:50.582
participants learn how treating
breast cancer in a tiger

00:12:50.582 --> 00:12:53.535
can help us better treat breast cancer

00:12:53.535 --> 00:12:56.846
in a kindergarten teacher;

00:12:56.846 --> 00:13:01.709
how understanding polycystic
overies in a Holstein cow

00:13:01.709 --> 00:13:03.943
can help us better take care

00:13:03.943 --> 00:13:08.503
of a dance instructor 
with painful periods;

00:13:08.503 --> 00:13:13.152
and how better understanding the 
treatment of separation anxiety

00:13:13.152 --> 00:13:15.561
in a high-strung Sheltie

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:22.962
can help an anxious young child
struggling with his first days of school.

00:13:22.962 --> 00:13:28.207
In the United States and now 
internationally, at Zoobiquity conferences

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:35.076
physicians and veterinarians check 
their attitudes and their preconceptions

00:13:35.076 --> 00:13:41.100
at the door and come 
together as colleagues,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.965
as peers, as doctors.

00:13:46.965 --> 00:13:52.385
After all, we humans 
are animals, too,

00:13:52.385 --> 00:13:55.845
and it's time for us physicians to embrace

00:13:55.845 --> 00:14:00.392
our patients' and our own animal natures

00:14:00.392 --> 00:14:02.530
and join veterinarians

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:07.518
in a species-spanning approach to health.

00:14:07.518 --> 00:14:09.731
Because it turns out,

00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:14.929
some of the best and 
most humanistic medicine

00:14:14.929 --> 00:14:20.469
is being practiced by doctors
whose patients aren't human.

00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:23.851
And one of the best ways 
we can take care

00:14:23.851 --> 00:14:28.952
of the human patient is by 
paying close attention

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:32.655
to how all the other 
patients on the planet

00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:39.312
live, grow, get sick and heal.

00:14:39.312 --> 00:14:41.897
Thank you.

00:14:41.897 --> 00:14:44.377
(Applause).
