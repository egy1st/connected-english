00:00:01.506 --> 00:00:03.335
When I arrived in Kiev,

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.731
on February 1 this year,

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.350
Independence Square was under siege,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.988
surrounded by police
loyal to the government.

00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:14.529
The protesters who occupied Maidan,

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.361
as the square is known,

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:17.981
prepared for battle,

00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:20.215
stockpiling homemade weapons

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.692
and mass-producing improvised body armor.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.133
The Euromaidan protests began peacefully
at the end of 2013,

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.353
after the president of Ukraine,
Viktor Yanukovych,

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:35.850
rejected a far-reaching accord
with the European Union

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.996
in favor of stronger ties with Russia.

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:42.204
In response, tens of thousands
of dissatisfied citizens

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:46.267
poured into central Kiev
to demonstrate against this allegiance.

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:49.291
As the months passed,

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:52.370
confrontations between police
and civilians intensified.

00:00:53.858 --> 00:01:00.248
I set up a makeshift portrait studio
by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street.

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:04.551
There, I photographed
the fighters against a black curtain,

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:08.909
a curtain that obscured
the highly seductive and visual backdrop

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:11.330
of fire, ice and smoke.

00:01:12.858 --> 00:01:16.242
In order to tell the individual
human stories here,

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.376
I felt that I needed to remove
the dramatic visuals

00:01:19.376 --> 00:01:24.455
that had become so familiar and repetitive
within the mainstream media.

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:28.593
What I was witnessing
was not only news, but also history.

00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:29.928
With this realization,

00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:32.864
I was free from
the photojournalistic conventions

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:34.938
of the newspaper and the magazine.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.895
Oleg, Vasiliy and Maxim
were all ordinary men,

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:42.934
with ordinary lives from ordinary towns.

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:47.623
But the elaborate costumes
that they had bedecked themselves in

00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:48.953
were quite extraordinary.

00:01:48.953 --> 00:01:50.744
I say the word "costume"

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:53.169
because these were not clothes
that had been issued

00:01:53.194 --> 00:01:54.634
or coordinated by anyone.

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.483
They were improvised uniforms

00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:00.363
made up of decommissioned
military equipment,

00:02:00.363 --> 00:02:05.725
irregular combat fatigues
and trophies taken from the police.

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:10.297
I became interested in the way they
were choosing to represent themselves,

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:13.843
this outward expression of masculinity,

00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:15.176
the ideal of the warrior.

00:02:16.724 --> 00:02:20.009
I worked slowly,
using an analog film camera

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.739
with a manual focusing loop
and a handheld light meter.

00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:25.505
The process is old-fashioned.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.268
It gives me time to speak with each person

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:32.977
and to look at them, in silence,
while they look back at me.

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:38.982
Rising tensions culminated
in the worst day of violence

00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:40.711
on February 20,

00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:43.663
which became known as Bloody Thursday.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.717
Snipers, loyal to the government,

00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:51.095
started firing on the civilians
and protesters on Institutskaya Street.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.833
Many were killed
in a very short space of time.

00:02:55.123 --> 00:02:59.236
The reception of the Hotel Ukraine
became a makeshift morgue.

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:02.238
There were lines
of bodies laid in the street.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.551
And there was blood
all over the pavements.

00:03:05.908 --> 00:03:10.146
The following day,
President Yanukovych fled Ukraine.

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:11.904
In all, three months of protests

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:15.373
resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead

00:03:15.398 --> 00:03:16.920
and many more missing.

00:03:17.913 --> 00:03:19.956
History unfolded quickly,

00:03:19.956 --> 00:03:22.377
but celebration remained
elusive in Maidan.

00:03:23.488 --> 00:03:26.289
As the days passed
in Kiev's central square,

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.828
streams of armed fighters

00:03:27.828 --> 00:03:31.254
were joined by tens of thousands
of ordinary people,

00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:33.825
filling the streets in an act
of collective mourning.

00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:37.588
Many were women who often carried flowers

00:03:37.588 --> 00:03:41.768
that they had brought to lay
as marks of respect for the dead.

00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:43.339
They came day after day

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.076
and they covered the square
with millions of flowers.

00:03:48.517 --> 00:03:51.281
Sadness enveloped Maidan.

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:53.895
It was quiet and I could hear
the birds singing.

00:03:53.895 --> 00:03:56.141
I hadn't heard that before.

00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:58.639
I stopped women
as they approached the barricades

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.782
to lay their tributes

00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:01.627
and asked to make their picture.

00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:05.592
Most women cried when I photographed them.

00:04:05.592 --> 00:04:07.768
On the first day,
my fixer, Emine, and I cried

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:10.971
with almost every woman
who visited our studio.

00:04:12.876 --> 00:04:15.882
There had been such a noticeable
absence of women

00:04:15.882 --> 00:04:17.625
up until that point.

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:19.918
And the color of their pastel coats,

00:04:19.918 --> 00:04:21.656
their shiny handbags,

00:04:21.656 --> 00:04:23.746
and the bunches of red carnations,

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:26.952
white tulips and yellow roses
that they carried

00:04:26.977 --> 00:04:29.113
jarred with the blackened square

00:04:29.113 --> 00:04:31.419
and the blackened men
who were encamped there.

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:35.956
It is clear to me
that these two sets of pictures

00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:38.694
don't make much sense without the other.

00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:41.091
They are about men and women
and the way we are --

00:04:41.091 --> 00:04:43.831
not the way we look,
but the way we are.

00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:46.663
They speak about different
gender roles in conflict,

00:04:46.663 --> 00:04:49.188
not only in Maidan,
and not only in Ukraine.

00:04:50.597 --> 00:04:54.399
Men fight most wars and women mourn them.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:56.835
If the men showed
the ideal of the warrior,

00:04:56.835 --> 00:04:59.514
then the women showed
the implications of such violence.

00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:03.020
When I made these pictures,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.824
I believed that I was documenting
the end of violent events in Ukraine.

00:05:06.824 --> 00:05:10.317
But now I understand
that it is a record of the beginning.

00:05:10.317 --> 00:05:13.730
Today, the death toll stands around 3,000,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.121
while hundreds of thousands
have been displaced.

00:05:17.847 --> 00:05:20.547
I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago.

00:05:20.547 --> 00:05:24.035
In Maidan, the barricades
have been dismantled,

00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:27.917
and the paving stones which were used
as weapons during the protests replaced,

00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:32.129
so that traffic flows freely
through the center of the square.

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.170
The fighters, the women
and the flowers are gone.

00:05:36.737 --> 00:05:40.534
A huge billboard depicting geese
flying over a wheat field

00:05:40.538 --> 00:05:43.778
covers the burned-out shell
of the trade union's building

00:05:43.806 --> 00:05:45.134
and proclaims,

00:05:45.234 --> 00:05:46.685
"Glory to Ukraine.

00:05:46.685 --> 00:05:48.383
Glory to heroes."

00:05:48.383 --> 00:05:49.383
Thank you.

00:05:49.383 --> 00:05:52.900
(Applause).
