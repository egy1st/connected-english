00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:05.717
The shocking police crackdown
on protestors in Ferguson, Missouri,

00:00:05.717 --> 00:00:08.729
in the wake of the police 
shooting of Michael Brown,

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:12.952
underscored the extent to which advanced
military weapons and equipment,

00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:14.684
designed for the battlefield,

00:00:14.684 --> 00:00:15.993
are making their way

00:00:15.993 --> 00:00:19.874
to small-town police departments
across the United States.

00:00:20.514 --> 00:00:22.500
Although much tougher to observe,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.047
this same thing is happening 
with surveillance equipment.

00:00:26.047 --> 00:00:28.707
NSA-style mass 
surveillance is enabling

00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:31.665
local police departments 
to gather vast quantities

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:35.232
of sensitive information
about each and every one of us

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:39.284
in a way that was
never previously possible.

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:42.760
Location information can 
be very sensitive.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.391
If you drive your car around
the United States,

00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:47.314
it can reveal if you go 
to a therapist,

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.782
attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting,

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:52.603
if you go to church 
or if you don't go to church.

00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:54.329
And when that 
information about you

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.824
is combined with the same information
about everyone else,

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.398
the government can gain 
a detailed portrait

00:01:00.398 --> 00:01:03.114
of how private citizens interact.

00:01:03.114 --> 00:01:05.589
This information used to be private.

00:01:05.589 --> 00:01:07.282
Thanks to modern technology,

00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:11.610
the government knows far too much
about what happens behind closed doors.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.998
And local police departments make
decisions about who they think you are

00:01:15.998 --> 00:01:19.169
based on this information.

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:23.816
One of the key technologies 
driving mass location tracking

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:26.774
is the innocuous-sounding
Automatic License Plate Reader.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:28.469
If you haven't seen one,

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.657
it's probably because you didn't
know what to look for --

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:33.032
they're everywhere.

00:01:33.032 --> 00:01:36.104
Mounted on roads or 
on police cars,

00:01:36.104 --> 00:01:40.533
Automatic License Plate Readers
capture images of every passing car

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:44.148
and convert the license plate
into machine-readable text

00:01:44.158 --> 00:01:47.560
so that they can be checked
against hot lists

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.845
of cars potentially wanted
for wrongdoing.

00:01:50.845 --> 00:01:52.972
But more than that, increasingly,

00:01:52.972 --> 00:01:55.122
local police departments 
are keeping records

00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:58.282
not just of people wanted for wrongdoing,

00:01:58.282 --> 00:02:01.084
but of every plate that 
passes them by,

00:02:01.084 --> 00:02:05.053
resulting in the collection
of mass quantities of data

00:02:05.053 --> 00:02:07.294
about where Americans have gone.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.902
Did you know this
was happening?

00:02:09.822 --> 00:02:13.228
When Mike Katz-Lacabe asked
his local police department

00:02:13.228 --> 00:02:16.657
for information about the plate
reader data they had on him,

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:18.335
this is what they got:

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:21.477
in addition to the date, 
time and location,

00:02:21.477 --> 00:02:24.508
the police department had 
photographs that captured

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:27.898
where he was going and 
often who he was with.

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:31.720
The second photo from the top
is a picture of Mike and his two daughters

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.552
getting out of their car
in their own driveway.

00:02:35.552 --> 00:02:38.340
The government has 
hundreds of photos like this

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.111
about Mike going about his daily life.

00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:43.295
And if you drive a car 
in the United States,

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:46.028
I would bet money 
that they have photographs

00:02:46.028 --> 00:02:48.946
like this of you going
about your daily life.

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:50.987
Mike hasn't done anything wrong.

00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:54.942
Why is it okay that the government
is keeping all of this information?

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.721
The reason it's happening is because,

00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:00.072
as the cost of storing
this data has plummeted,

00:03:00.072 --> 00:03:02.584
the police departments
simply hang on to it,

00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:06.366
just in case it could be useful someday.

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:08.866
The issue is not just that
one police department

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:11.487
is gathering this information in isolation

00:03:11.487 --> 00:03:14.246
or even that multiple police 
departments are doing it.

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:16.743
At the same time, the federal government

00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:20.361
is collecting all of these
individual pots of data,

00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:23.682
and pooling them together 
into one vast database

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:25.338
with hundreds of millions of hits,

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.456
showing where Americans have traveled.

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:30.964
This document from the 
Federal Drug Enforcement Administration,

00:03:30.964 --> 00:03:33.729
which is one of the agencies
primarily interested in this,

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:38.166
is one of several that reveal 
the existence of this database.

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:40.735
Meanwhile, in New York City,

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:44.677
the NYPD has driven police cars
equipped with license plate readers

00:03:44.677 --> 00:03:48.851
past mosques in order to
figure out who is attending.

00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:52.689
The uses and abuses of this technology
aren't limited to the United States.

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.724
In the U.K., the police department

00:03:55.724 --> 00:03:59.868
put 80-year-old John Kat
on a plate reader watch list

00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:04.145
after he had attended dozens of
lawful political demonstrations

00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:08.771
where he liked to sit on a bench
and sketch the attendees.

00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:12.293
License plate readers aren't the
only mass location tracking technology

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:14.449
available to law enforcement agents today.

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.461
Through a technique known as
a cell tower dump,

00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:20.713
law enforcement agents can
uncover who was using

00:04:20.713 --> 00:04:22.998
one or more cell towers
at a particular time,

00:04:22.998 --> 00:04:25.030
a technique which has been known to reveal

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.309
the location of tens of thousands
and even hundreds of thousands of people.

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.549
Also, using a device known as a StingRay,

00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:35.185
law enforcement agents
can send tracking signals

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:39.550
inside people's houses
to identify the cell phones located there.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.812
And if they don't know
which house to target,

00:04:41.812 --> 00:04:43.998
they've been known 
to drive this technology

00:04:43.998 --> 00:04:47.424
around through whole neighborhoods.

00:04:47.424 --> 00:04:52.060
Just as the police in Ferguson possess
high-tech military weapons and equipment,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.042
so too do police departments across
the United States

00:04:55.042 --> 00:04:57.377
possess high-tech surveillance gear.

00:04:57.377 --> 00:04:59.408
Just because you don't see it,

00:04:59.408 --> 00:05:01.793
doesn't mean it's not there.

00:05:01.793 --> 00:05:04.344
The question is, what should
we do about this?

00:05:04.344 --> 00:05:07.654
I think this poses a serious
civil liberties threat.

00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:12.016
History has shown that once the police 
have massive quantities of data,

00:05:12.016 --> 00:05:14.095
tracking the movements of innocent people,

00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:18.411
it gets abused, maybe for blackmail,
maybe for political advantage,

00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:20.670
or maybe for simple voyeurism.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.012
Fortunately, there are steps we can take.

00:05:23.012 --> 00:05:26.742
Local police departments can 
be governed by the city councils,

00:05:26.742 --> 00:05:29.664
which can pass laws requiring the police

00:05:29.664 --> 00:05:32.586
to dispose of the data 
about innocent people

00:05:32.586 --> 00:05:35.748
while allowing the legitimate
uses of the technology to go forward.

00:05:35.748 --> 00:05:37.423
Thank you.

00:05:37.423 --> 00:05:41.424
(Applause).
