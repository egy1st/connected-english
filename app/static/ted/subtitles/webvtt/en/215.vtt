WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I draw to better understand things.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Sometimes I make a lot of drawings

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that the guy who is best known for "The Way Things Work,"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
while preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Who knew about extension managers?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I've always managed my own extensions

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because along with the invitation

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but some alternate form of communication would.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now, I could talk about something that I'm known for,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
something that would be particularly appropriate

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
for many of the more technically minded people here,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
or I could talk about something I really care about.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I decided to go with the latter.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm going to talk about Rome.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now, why would I care about Rome, particularly?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Well, I went to Rhode Island School of Design

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in the second half of the '60s to study architecture.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I was lucky enough to spend my last year, my fifth year,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
in Rome as a student. It changed my life.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
driving into RISD everyday, driving back.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I missed the '60s. I read about them; (Laughter)

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and it's a place that is never far from my mind.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So, whenever given an opportunity,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I try to do something in it or with it or for it.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I also make drawings to help people understand things.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Things that I want them to believe I understand.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And that's what I do as an illustrator,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that's my job.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So, I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
These are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I need to.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
All different materials, all different styles, all different times,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Part of the reason I'm showing you these

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
These are sketches of some of the little details.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Rome is a city full of surprises.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
we're talking about narrow little winding streets

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
never, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
That amazing juxtaposition of old and new,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
the bits of light that come down between the buildings

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
usually blue -- especially in the summer --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
compared to the map that you would normally expect to see

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
of conventional streets.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
How could I share my sense of Rome,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
my understanding of Rome?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends, basically.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The primary reason for all these dead ends is when

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
if you're not quite sure where you're going, you're certainly not going to get there

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
with any kind of efficiency.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning;

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
maybe I should just try and do a little atlas

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
of my favorite streets and connections in Rome.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And here's a line of text that actually evolves

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Maybe that line of text could be a story

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
to help give some human aspect to this.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Maybe I should get away from this map completely,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and simply kick a soccer ball in the air --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
which happens in so many of the squares in the city --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
That seemed like a sort of a cheap shot.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But even though I just started this presentation,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
this is not the first thing that I tried to do

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and I was getting sort of desperate.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Eventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
so I decided to move towards packaging. (Laughter)

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But one of the ideas that emerged

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
in different vehicles at different speeds in order

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to show the different aspects of Rome.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Sort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Quick snapshots of things you might see

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
from a speeding motor scooter, and very slow

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
walking through Rome, you might be able to study in more detail

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Anyways, I went back to the dirigible notion.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Went to Alberto Santos-Dumont.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
so I could actually use it as a scale

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
that I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
This thing would be flying over or past

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
or be parked in front of, but it would be like having a ruler --

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Not that you know how long number 11 actually is,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
with number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and so on and so forth. If you were interested.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
This is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
she's assembling the structure,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
She launches this thing above the Spanish Steps

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and sets off for an aerial tour of the city.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Over the Spanish Steps we go.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
A nice way to show that river, that stream sort of pouring down the hill.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Unfortunately, just across the road from it

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
as you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close, nudges it.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
of the Column of Marcus Aurelius,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
which is really no more than a pile of quarters

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
high -- thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
completely ruining the symmetry, but that aside

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
a spectacular place to visit.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
A spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
extraordinary blue sky.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Over the Pantheon and the 26-foot diameter Oculus.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
She parks her dirigible, lowers the anchor rope

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and climbs down for a closer look inside.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and from her point of view -- looking in the hole,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
getting a different kind of perspective,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
moving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that can contain perfectly a sphere

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
dimensions of the diameter being the same

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Unfortunately for her, the anchor line gets tangled

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and they are immediately yanked out

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
of some of the domes of Rome, which would,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
from their point of view, naturally be hanging upside down.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
that little spiral structure you see there.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
She continues on her way over Piazza Navona.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and then is completely removed

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Anyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Unfortunately, when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Ajax makes a lunge for it.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
She's managed to save the prosciutto,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
but in the process she loses the tablecloth,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
They continue without their tablecloth,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
They eventually discover a huge wall

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that's filled with small holes, ideal for docking a dirigible

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
because you've got a place to tie up.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Turns out to be the exterior wall --

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and have a spectacular view.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and then an abandoned gatehouse

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
which has this lightning rod on top.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and when you're in a dirigible

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
you have to be very careful about spikes.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Marcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but he's not due at work until about noon.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So, the alarm goes off and it's five to 12 or so.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
He gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
past the church of Santa Maria della Pace,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
down the alleys, through the streets

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that tourists may be wandering through,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
That speed with which he is moving, I hope I have suggested in this little image,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
which, again, can be turned around and read from both sides

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
because there's text on the bottom and text on the top,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
one of which is upside down in this image.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
in a delicate white wine clam sauce

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Waiter catches on, but it's too late.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Removes some scaffolding. One of the reasons

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
because of scaffolding and the determination

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
to maintain the fabric, it is a city that continues

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
in which it finds itself, or we find it.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Right through the Piazza della Rotonda,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
in front of the Pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Marcello, as it turns out,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
is the driver of the number 64 bus,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
He's looking at his table;

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years, (Laughter)

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and he wants it to be perfect.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
He's got candles out, he's got flowers in the middle

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
But he's not happy; something's wrong.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
The phone rings anyway, he's called to the palazzo.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Everybody knows Carletto, because he's in entertainment,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
actually; he's in television.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
He's actually in television repair, which is why people know him.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So they all have his number.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
He arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo;

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
nobody's TVs are working

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and there's a big soccer game coming up,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
apartment by apartment, checking every television,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
checking every connection,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
hoping to find out what this problem is.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
He works his way up, finally, the grand staircase

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
He opens the window of the attic, of course, and there's a tablecloth

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
wrapped around the building's television antenna.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
He removes it, the problems are solved,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
everybody in the palazzo is happy.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And of course, he also solves his own problem.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
All he has to do now, with a perfect table,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
is wait for her to arrive.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
That was the first attempt, but it didn't seem substantial enough

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and I'll get inside and underneath

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and I'll show these things growing

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And then I thought, that's too complicated. No,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Now that's one drawing,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher. (Laughter)

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and also hope.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
There's a very thin blue line of exhaust

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Then I thought, "Wait a minute, what am I doing?"

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
it's a series of layers.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I mean, you always peel one layer off another;

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
we think of them as pages, doing it a certain way.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
But think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers --

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
horizontal layers, vertical layers --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to --

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
if I got you thinking about it the right way --

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
covers the scars; the scars of centuries of change

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
as these structures have been adapted

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
rather than being torn down.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
You can see that in 1635,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
it became essential to make smaller windows

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
because the bad guys were coming or whatever.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Adaptations all get buried under the stucco.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
But more importantly, I could also show you

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
with all the massive stone blocks,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
which is more often the case.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So it becomes slightly three-dimensional.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I could take you down one of those narrow little streets

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold --

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
double foldout page -- which, if you were like me

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
reading a pop-up book as a child, you hopefully stick your head into.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You wrap the pages around your head

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and are in that piazza for that brief period of time.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And I've really not done anything much more complicated

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
than make foldout pages.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
But then I thought, maybe I could be simpler here.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Let's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Here's a book completely wide open.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
OK, if I don't open the book the whole way,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And if I turn the book the other way,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
we're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
No foldouts, no tricks --

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
just a book that isn't open the whole way.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
That seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
So we get inside the Pantheon

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and it grows and so on and so forth.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And I thought, maybe I'm on the right track,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
but it sort of lost its human quality.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So I went back to the notion of story,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
"Pigeon's Progress" struck me as a catchy title.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
If it was a homing pigeon,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
it would be called "Homer's Odyssey."

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But it was the journey of the ... (Laughter)

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and showed all the things that I like about Rome.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
It's a pigeon sitting on top of a church.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and there's no way this pigeon can get home.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
So it's a homeless pigeon now

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and it's going to have to find another place to live,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and we start with the tall ones and so on.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Maybe it has to go back and live with family members;

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
that's not always a good thing,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
but it does sort of bring pigeons together again.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And I thought, that's sort of interesting,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
but maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So I kind of came up with this old guy

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
who spends his life looking after sick pigeons.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
He'll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot --

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and they become really friends with this guy,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
There's a real bond that develops

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
between this old man and these pigeons.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
He's taught them to spell his name, which is Aldo.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him --

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
he lives in this little garret --

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
and they spell his name and fly around.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And he finally gets enough strength together

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
to climb up the ladder onto the roof,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
and all the pigeons, a la Red Balloon, are there waiting for him

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
and they carry him off over the walls of the city.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And I forgot to mention this:

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
whenever he lost a pigeon, he would take that pigeon

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
out beyond the walls of the city.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
In the old Roman custom, the dead

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
were never buried within the walls.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And I thought that's a really cheery story.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
(Laughter). That's really going to go a long way.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
So anyway, I went through ... And again, if packaging doesn't work

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and if the stories aren't going anywhere,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
I just come up with titles

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And sometimes it does focus me enough

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
and I'll even do a title page.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
So, these are all title pages that eventually led me

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
who sends a message on a homing pigeon --

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
If you see the red line,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
you are seeing the trail of the pigeon;

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And it becomes necessary and possible, at this point,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
to try to convey what that sense would be like

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
of flying over the city without actually moving.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Past the Pyramid of Cestius --

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
these will seem very familiar to you, even if you haven't been to Rome recently --

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
past the gatehouse.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
This is something that's a little bit unusual.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do:

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
it takes the scenic route, (Laughter) which was a device

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
beyond about four pages.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
So, we circle around the Coliseum, past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
and the Temple of Hercules towards the river.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese --

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
designed by Michelangelo,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
built of stone taken from the Coliseum -- narrow escape.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
We swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
This is one of those things I show to my students

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
because it's a complete bastardization --

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
a denial of any rules of perspective.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
The only rule of perspective that I think matters is

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
if it looks believable, you've succeeded.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
But you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here;

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
a couple are on Mars and

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
a couple of others in Cremona.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
But into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
where invariably a soccer game is going on,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
and we're hit by a soccer ball.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
I have all the pieces:

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
there's Santa Maria della Pace, there's a soccer ball,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
so I had to rethink it.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
these books are really flexible, incredibly interactive --

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
just turn it around and look at it the other way.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Through the alley, we can see the impact is captured in the red line.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower --

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
one of the few remaining medieval towers --

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
towards the church of Sant'Agnese

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona --

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times;

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
there's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers --

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
of the Pantheon to catch our breath.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu;

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about;

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon "Ristorante" sign, and so on.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
And eventually, we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
which is our destination.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Straight up through the courtyard

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
into a little window into the attic,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
where somebody is working at the drawing board.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
He removes the message from the leg of the bird; this is what it says.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
As we look at the drawing board,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
we see what he's working on is, in fact,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
and the red line extends through all the sights.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
And if you want the information, so that we complete this cycle of understanding,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
all you have to do is read these paragraphs.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Thank you very much.
