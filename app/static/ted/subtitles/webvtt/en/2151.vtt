00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:03.167
I was on a long road trip this summer,

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:06.245
and I was having
a wonderful time listening

00:00:06.245 --> 00:00:10.992
to the amazing Isabel Wilkerson's
"The Warmth of Other Suns."

00:00:10.992 --> 00:00:20.761
It documents six million black folks
fleeing the South from 1915 to 1970

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:24.238
looking for a respite
from all the brutality

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:27.999
and trying to get to a better
opportunity up North,

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.407
and it was filled with stories
of the resilience and the brilliance

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.362
of African-Americans,

00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:38.731
and it was also really hard to hear
all the stories of the horrors

00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:43.430

and the humility,
and all the humiliations.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.029
It was especially hard to hear
about the beatings and the burnings

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:51.366
and the lynchings of black men.

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.632
And I said, "You know,
this is a little deep.

00:00:54.632 --> 00:00:58.915
I need a break. I'm going
to turn on the radio."

00:00:58.915 --> 00:01:01.561
I turned it on, and there it was:

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.233
Ferguson, Missouri,

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:05.815
Michael Brown,

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:08.665
18-year-old black man,

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:14.564
unarmed, shot by a white police officer,
laid on the ground dead,

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:18.478
blood running for four hours

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:22.993
while his grandmother and little children
and his neighbors watched in horror,

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:24.989
and I thought,

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:29.240
here it is again.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.962
This violence, this brutality
against black men

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:35.824
has been going on for centuries.

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:40.385
I mean, it's the same story.
It's just different names.

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:43.908
It could have been Amadou Diallo.

00:01:44.498 --> 00:01:46.823
It could have been Sean Bell.

00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:50.213
It could have been Oscar Grant.

00:01:50.213 --> 00:01:53.065
It could have been Trayvon Martin.

00:01:54.205 --> 00:01:57.044
This violence, this brutality,

00:01:57.044 --> 00:01:59.863
is really something that's part
of our national psyche.

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:02.632
It's part of our collective history.

00:02:02.632 --> 00:02:07.447
What are we going to do about it?

00:02:07.447 --> 00:02:11.672
You know that part of us that still
crosses the street,

00:02:12.672 --> 00:02:14.722
locks the doors,

00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:17.076
clutches the purses,

00:02:17.076 --> 00:02:19.962
when we see young black men?

00:02:19.962 --> 00:02:22.023
That part.

00:02:22.023 --> 00:02:25.971
I mean, I know we're not
shooting people down in the street,

00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:30.058
but I'm saying that the same
stereotypes and prejudices

00:02:30.058 --> 00:02:33.123
that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents


00:02:33.123 --> 00:02:35.328
are in us.

00:02:35.328 --> 00:02:39.195
We've been schooled in them as well.

00:02:39.195 --> 00:02:45.758
I believe that we can stop
these types of incidents,

00:02:45.758 --> 00:02:48.729
these Fergusons from happening,

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:54.078
by looking within
and being willing to change ourselves.

00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:57.369
So I have a call to action for you.

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:01.454
There are three things that I want
to offer us today to think about

00:03:01.454 --> 00:03:06.562
as ways to stop Ferguson
from happening again;

00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:08.861
three things that I think will help us

00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.336
reform our images of young black men;

00:03:12.336 --> 00:03:16.652
three things that I'm hoping
will not only protect them

00:03:16.652 --> 00:03:20.848
but will open the world
so that they can thrive.

00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:22.619
Can you imagine that?

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:27.700
Can you imagine our country
embracing young black men,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.045
seeing them as part of our future,
giving them that kind of openness,

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:36.758
that kind of grace we give
to people we love?

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:41.054
How much better would our lives be?
How much better would our country be?

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.967
Let me just start with number one.

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:46.906
We gotta get out of denial.

00:03:48.956 --> 00:03:51.359
Stop trying to be good people.

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.503
We need real people.

00:03:53.503 --> 00:03:55.412
You know, I do a lot of diversity work,

00:03:55.412 --> 00:03:58.382
and people will come up to me
at the beginning of the workshop.

00:03:58.382 --> 00:04:02.067
They're like, "Oh, Ms. Diversity Lady,
we're so glad you're here" --

00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:03.646
(Laughter) --

00:04:03.646 --> 00:04:06.659
"but we don't have a biased bone 
in our body."

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.522
And I'm like, "Really?

00:04:08.522 --> 00:04:13.010
Because I do this work every day,
and I see all my biases."

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.525
I mean, not too long ago, I was on a plane

00:04:16.525 --> 00:04:20.902
and I heard the voice of a woman
pilot coming over the P.A. system,

00:04:20.902 --> 00:04:23.014
and I was just so excited, so thrilled.

00:04:23.014 --> 00:04:26.116
I was like, "Yes, women,
we are rocking it.

00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:28.326
We are now in the stratosphere."

00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:31.460
It was all good, and then it started
getting turbulent and bumpy,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.877
and I was like,

00:04:32.877 --> 00:04:35.295
"I hope she can drive."

00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:36.634
(Laughter)

00:04:36.634 --> 00:04:37.826
I know. Right.

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:40.068
But it's not even like
I knew that was a bias

00:04:40.068 --> 00:04:43.558
until I was coming back on the other leg
and there's always a guy driving

00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:45.307
and it's often turbulent and bumpy,

00:04:45.307 --> 00:04:48.133
and I've never questioned
the confidence of the male driver.

00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:50.089
The pilot is good.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:52.585
Now, here's the problem.

00:04:52.585 --> 00:05:00.096
If you ask me explicitly,
I would say, "Female pilot: awesome."

00:05:00.096 --> 00:05:04.792
But it appears that when things get funky
and a little troublesome, a little risky,

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:08.802
I lean on a bias that I didn't
even know that I had.

00:05:08.802 --> 00:05:11.416
You know, fast-moving planes in the sky,

00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:13.379
I want a guy.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.662
That's my default.

00:05:15.662 --> 00:05:18.291
Men are my default.

00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:20.611
Who is your default?

00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:22.641
Who do you trust?

00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:24.774
Who are you afraid of?

00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:28.805
Who do you implicitly feel connected to?

00:05:28.805 --> 00:05:31.847
Who do you run away from?

00:05:31.847 --> 00:05:34.271
I'm going to tell you
what we have learned.

00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:39.669
The implicit association test,
which measures unconscious bias,

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.389
you can go online and take it.

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.645
Five million people have taken it.

00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:49.555
Turns out, our default is white.
We like white people.

00:05:49.555 --> 00:05:52.315
We prefer white. What do I mean by that?

00:05:52.315 --> 00:05:57.569
When people are shown images 
of black men and white men,

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.562
we are more quickly able to associate

00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:05.640
that picture with a positive word,
that white person with a positive word,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.305
than we are when we are 
trying to associate

00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:11.520
positive with a black face,
and vice versa.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.900
When we see a black face,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.948
it is easier for us to connect
black with negative

00:06:19.948 --> 00:06:22.075
than it is white with negative.

00:06:22.075 --> 00:06:27.339
Seventy percent of white people
taking that test prefer white.

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.753
Fifty percent of black people
taking that test prefer white.

00:06:33.753 --> 00:06:39.310
You see, we were all outside
when the contamination came down.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.697
What do we do about the fact
that our brain automatically associates?

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:51.306
You know, one of the things
that you probably are thinking about,

00:06:51.306 --> 00:06:53.284
and you're probably like, you know what,

00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:56.818
I'm just going to double down
on my color blindness.

00:06:56.818 --> 00:06:58.545
Yes, I'm going to recommit to that.

00:06:58.545 --> 00:07:00.662
I'm going to suggest to you, no.

00:07:00.662 --> 00:07:03.821
We've gone about as far as we can go
trying to make a difference

00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:05.434
trying to not see color.

00:07:05.434 --> 00:07:10.269
The problem was never that we saw color.
It was what we did when we saw the color.

00:07:10.269 --> 00:07:14.270
It's a false ideal.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.040
And while we're busy 
pretending not to see,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.871
we are not being aware of the ways
in which racial difference

00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:26.152
is changing people's possibilities,
that's keeping them from thriving,

00:07:26.152 --> 00:07:31.339
and sometimes it's causing them
an early death.

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:36.885
So in fact, what the scientists
are telling us is, no way.

00:07:36.885 --> 00:07:39.280
Don't even think about color blindness.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.760
In fact, what they're suggesting is,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.290
stare at awesome black people.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.030
(Laughter)

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.997
Look at them directly in their faces
and memorize them,

00:07:52.997 --> 00:07:57.663
because when we look
at awesome folks who are black,

00:07:57.663 --> 00:08:00.872
it helps to dissociate

00:08:00.872 --> 00:08:06.405
the association that happens
automatically in our brain.

00:08:06.405 --> 00:08:11.827
Why do you think I'm showing you
these beautiful black men behind me?

00:08:11.827 --> 00:08:15.039
There were so many, I had to cut them.

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:16.351
Okay, so here's the thing:

00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:22.279
I'm trying to reset your automatic
associations about who black men are.

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:24.641
I'm trying to remind you

00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:29.665
that young black men
grow up to be amazing human beings

00:08:29.665 --> 00:08:35.371
who have changed our lives
and made them better.

00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:37.890
So here's the thing.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.441
The other possibility in science,

00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:43.365
and it's only temporarily changing
our automatic assumptions,

00:08:43.365 --> 00:08:45.870
but one thing we know

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.662
is that if you take a white person
who is odious that you know,

00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:53.672
and stick it up next to a person of color,

00:08:53.672 --> 00:08:56.131
a black person, who is fabulous,

00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:59.637
then that sometimes actually
causes us to disassociate too.

00:08:59.637 --> 00:09:04.851
So think Jeffrey Dahmer and Colin Powell.

00:09:04.851 --> 00:09:07.359
Just stare at them, right? (Laughter)

00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:10.168
But these are the things.
So go looking for your bias.

00:09:10.168 --> 00:09:14.257
Please, please, just get out of denial
and go looking for disconfirming data

00:09:14.257 --> 00:09:18.847
that will prove that in fact
your old stereotypes are wrong.

00:09:18.847 --> 00:09:20.781
Okay, so that's number one: number two,

00:09:20.781 --> 00:09:25.466
what I'm going to say is move toward
young black men instead of away from them.

00:09:25.466 --> 00:09:28.058
It's not the hardest thing to do,

00:09:28.058 --> 00:09:31.928
but it's also one of these things

00:09:31.928 --> 00:09:34.604
where you have to be conscious 
and intentional about it.

00:09:34.604 --> 00:09:37.712
You know, I was in a Wall Street area 
one time several years ago

00:09:37.712 --> 00:09:41.094
when I was with a colleague of mine,
and she's really wonderful

00:09:41.094 --> 00:09:44.734
and she does diversity work with me
and she's a woman of color, she's Korean.

00:09:44.734 --> 00:09:46.684
And we were outside,
it was late at night,

00:09:46.684 --> 00:09:49.726
and we were sort of wondering where
we were going, we were lost.

00:09:49.726 --> 00:09:53.910
And I saw this person across the street,
and I was thinking, "Oh great, black guy."

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.678
I was going toward him
without even thinking about it.

00:09:56.678 --> 00:10:00.462
And she was like,
"Oh, that's interesting."

00:10:00.462 --> 00:10:03.280
The guy across the street,
he was a black guy.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.939
I think black guys generally
know where they're going.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:10.584
I don't know why exactly I think that,
but that's what I think.

00:10:10.584 --> 00:10:15.925
So she was saying, "Oh, you
were going, 'Yay, a black guy'?"

00:10:15.925 --> 00:10:18.989
She said, "I was going,
'Ooh, a black guy.'"

00:10:18.989 --> 00:10:22.385
Other direction. Same need,
same guy, same clothes,


00:10:22.385 --> 00:10:25.734
same time, same street,
different reaction.

00:10:25.734 --> 00:10:28.463
And she said, "I feel so bad.
I'm a diversity consultant.

00:10:28.463 --> 00:10:31.281
I did the black guy thing.
I'm a woman of color. Oh my God!"

00:10:31.281 --> 00:10:35.055
And I said, "You know what? Please.
We really need to relax about this."

00:10:35.055 --> 00:10:38.781
I mean, you've got to realize
I go way back with black guys.

00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:41.527
(Laughter)

00:10:41.527 --> 00:10:44.763
My dad is a black guy.
You see what I'm saying?

00:10:44.763 --> 00:10:48.703
I've got a 6'5" black guy son.
I was married to a black guy.

00:10:48.703 --> 00:10:51.219
My black guy thing
is so wide and so deep

00:10:51.219 --> 00:10:56.009
that I can pretty much sort
and figure out who that black guy is,

00:10:56.009 --> 00:10:57.959
and he was my black guy.

00:10:57.959 --> 00:11:01.733
He said, "Yes, ladies, I know
where you're going. I'll take you there."

00:11:01.733 --> 00:11:05.376
You know, biases are the stories
we make up about people

00:11:05.376 --> 00:11:07.888
before we know who they actually are.

00:11:07.888 --> 00:11:10.620
But how are we going to know who they are

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.427
when we've been told to avoid
and be afraid of them?

00:11:14.427 --> 00:11:19.480
So I'm going to tell you
to walk toward your discomfort.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.517
And I'm not asking you
to take any crazy risks.

00:11:22.517 --> 00:11:27.417
I'm saying, just do an inventory,

00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:31.309
expand your social
and professional circles.

00:11:31.309 --> 00:11:33.139
Who's in your circle?

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:34.595
Who's missing?

00:11:35.635 --> 00:11:39.592
How many authentic relationships

00:11:39.592 --> 00:11:46.062
do you have with young black people,
folks, men, women?

00:11:46.062 --> 00:11:49.814
Or any other major difference
from who you are

00:11:49.814 --> 00:11:53.150
and how you roll, so to speak?

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.229
Because, you know what?
Just look around your periphery.

00:11:56.229 --> 00:11:58.532
There may be somebody at work,
in your classroom,

00:11:58.532 --> 00:12:01.980
in your house of worship, somewhere,
there's some black young guy there.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.438
And you're nice. You say hi.

00:12:03.438 --> 00:12:09.784
I'm saying go deeper, closer, further,
and build the kinds of relationships,

00:12:09.784 --> 00:12:15.064
the kinds of friendships that actually
cause you to see the holistic person

00:12:15.064 --> 00:12:18.552
and to really go against the stereotypes.

00:12:18.552 --> 00:12:20.145
I know some of you are out there,

00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:23.436

I know because I have some white
friends in particular that will say,

00:12:23.436 --> 00:12:25.408
"You have no idea how awkward I am.

00:12:25.408 --> 00:12:28.140
Like, I don't think this
is going to work for me.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.876
I'm sure I'm going to blow this."

00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:35.835
Okay, maybe, but this thing is not 
about perfection. It's about connection.

00:12:35.835 --> 00:12:40.839
And you're not going to get comfortable
before you get uncomfortable.

00:12:40.839 --> 00:12:42.969
I mean, you just have to do it.

00:12:42.969 --> 00:12:45.316
And young black men, what I'm saying is

00:12:45.316 --> 00:12:50.361
if someone comes your way, genuinely
and authentically, take the invitation.

00:12:50.361 --> 00:12:52.211
Not everyone is out to get you.

00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:56.691
Go looking for those people
who can see your humanity.

00:12:56.691 --> 00:13:00.199
You know, it's the empathy
and the compassion

00:13:00.199 --> 00:13:04.903
that comes out of having relationships
with people who are different from you.

00:13:04.903 --> 00:13:07.898
Something really powerful
and beautiful happens:

00:13:07.898 --> 00:13:10.414
you start to realize that they are you,

00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:16.196
that they are part of you,
that they are you in your family,

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:19.194
and then we cease to be bystanders

00:13:19.194 --> 00:13:23.179
and we become actors,
we become advocates,

00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:25.677
and we become allies.

00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:31.148
So go away from your comfort
into a bigger, brighter thing,

00:13:31.148 --> 00:13:36.140
because that is how we will stop
another Ferguson from happening.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.370
That's how we create a community

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.382
where everybody, especially
young black men, can thrive.

00:13:41.382 --> 00:13:44.305
So this last thing is going to be harder,

00:13:44.305 --> 00:13:47.173
and I know it, but I'm just going
to put it out there anyway.

00:13:47.173 --> 00:13:52.412
When we see something, we have to have
the courage to say something,

00:13:52.412 --> 00:13:56.206
even to the people we love.

00:13:56.206 --> 00:13:59.847
You know, it's holidays
and it's going to be a time

00:13:59.847 --> 00:14:03.279
when we're sitting around the table
and having a good time.

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:05.478
Many of us, anyways, will be in holidays,

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:10.402
and you've got to listen to
the conversations around the table.

00:14:10.402 --> 00:14:17.094
You start to say things like,
"Grandma's a bigot."

00:14:17.094 --> 00:14:18.924
(Laughter)

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:21.863
"Uncle Joe is racist."

00:14:21.863 --> 00:14:26.482
And you know, we love Grandma
and we love Uncle Joe. We do.

00:14:26.482 --> 00:14:31.937
We know they're good people,
but what they're saying is wrong.

00:14:33.317 --> 00:14:38.964
And we need to be able to say something,
because you know who else is at the table?

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.154
The children are at the table.

00:14:43.154 --> 00:14:48.399
And we wonder why these biases don't die,
and move from generation to generation?

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:51.650
Because we're not saying anything.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:58.172
We've got to be willing to say, "Grandma,
we don't call people that anymore."

00:14:58.172 --> 00:15:03.383
"Uncle Joe, it isn't true
that he deserved that.

00:15:03.383 --> 00:15:06.319
No one deserves that."

00:15:06.319 --> 00:15:09.733
And we've got to be willing

00:15:09.733 --> 00:15:14.507
to not shelter our children
from the ugliness of racism

00:15:14.507 --> 00:15:17.819
when black parents don't
have the luxury to do so,

00:15:17.819 --> 00:15:22.600
especially those who have 
young black sons.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.981
We've got to take 
our lovely darlings, our future,

00:15:25.981 --> 00:15:33.783
and we've got to tell them we have 
an amazing country with incredible ideals,

00:15:33.783 --> 00:15:36.762
we have worked incredibly hard,
and we have made some progress,

00:15:36.762 --> 00:15:39.932
but we are not done.

00:15:39.932 --> 00:15:43.926
We still have in us this old stuff

00:15:43.926 --> 00:15:46.967
about superiority and it is causing us

00:15:46.967 --> 00:15:50.439
to embed those further
into our institutions

00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:52.418
and our society and generations,

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:56.027
and it is making for despair

00:15:56.027 --> 00:16:03.151
and disparities and a devastating
devaluing of young black men.

00:16:03.151 --> 00:16:05.612
We still struggle, you have to tell them,

00:16:05.612 --> 00:16:08.390
with seeing both the color

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:12.024
and the character of young black men,

00:16:12.024 --> 00:16:15.857
but that you, and you expect them,

00:16:15.857 --> 00:16:20.371
to be part of the forces of change
in this society

00:16:20.371 --> 00:16:26.939
that will stand against injustice
and is willing, above all other things,

00:16:26.939 --> 00:16:35.725
to make a society where young black men 
can be seen for all of who they are.

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:41.627
So many amazing black men,

00:16:41.627 --> 00:16:49.959
those who are the most amazing
statesmen that have ever lived,

00:16:49.959 --> 00:16:52.992
brave soldiers,

00:16:52.992 --> 00:16:57.286
awesome, hardworking laborers.

00:16:57.286 --> 00:17:01.942
These are people who
are powerful preachers.

00:17:01.942 --> 00:17:07.537
They are incredible scientists
and artists and writers.

00:17:07.537 --> 00:17:11.512
They are dynamic comedians.

00:17:11.512 --> 00:17:16.448
They are doting grandpas,

00:17:16.448 --> 00:17:19.480
caring sons.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.237
They are strong fathers,

00:17:24.237 --> 00:17:28.593
and they are young men
with dreams of their own.

00:17:28.593 --> 00:17:32.150
Thank you.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.283
(Applause)
