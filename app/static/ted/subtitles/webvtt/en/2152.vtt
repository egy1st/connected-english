00:00:00.973 --> 00:00:03.209
While preparing for my talk

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:07.263
I was reflecting on my life
and trying to figure out

00:00:07.263 --> 00:00:12.187
where exactly was that moment
when my journey began.

00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:14.834
A long time passed by,
and I simply couldn't figure out

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:17.806
the beginning or the middle
or the end of my story.

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:19.757
I always used to think that my beginning

00:00:19.757 --> 00:00:23.867
was one afternoon in my community
when my mother had told me

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:27.308
that I had escaped three
arranged marriages by the time I was two.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:32.713
Or one evening when electricity had failed
for eight hours in our community,

00:00:32.713 --> 00:00:34.965
and my dad sat, surrounded by all of us,

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:38.866
telling us stories of when he was
a little kid struggling to go to school

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:42.974
while his father, who was a farmer,
wanted him to work in the fields with him.

00:00:42.974 --> 00:00:45.722
Or that dark night when I was 16

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:50.139
when three little kids had come to me
and they whispered in my ear

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:54.416
that my friend was murdered
in something called the honor killings.

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:58.231
But then I realized that,

00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:01.948
as much as I know that these moments
have contributed on my journey,

00:01:01.948 --> 00:01:03.548
they have influenced my journey

00:01:03.548 --> 00:01:05.707
but they have not been
the beginning of it,

00:01:05.707 --> 00:01:10.003
but the true beginning of my journey
was in front of a mud house

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.626
in upper Sindh of Pakistan,

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:15.482
where my father held the hand
of my 14-year-old mother

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:17.502
and they decided
to walk out of the village

00:01:17.502 --> 00:01:20.962
to go to a town where they could
send their kids to school.

00:01:20.962 --> 00:01:23.168
In a way, I feel like my life

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:28.903
is kind of a result of some wise choices
and decisions they've made.

00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:31.759
And just like that,
another of their decisions

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.986
was to keep me and my siblings
connected to our roots.

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:39.235
While we were living in a community
I fondly remember as called Ribabad,

00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:41.464
which means community of the poor,

00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:45.156
my dad made sure that we also
had a house in our rural homeland.

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:48.780
I come from an indigenous tribe
in the mountains of Balochistan

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.520
called Brahui.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.688
Brahui, or Brohi, means mountain dweller,
and it is also my language.

00:01:55.688 --> 00:01:59.924
Thanks to my father's very strict rules
about connecting to our customs,

00:01:59.924 --> 00:02:05.655
I had to live a beautiful life of songs, 
cultures, traditions, stories, mountains,

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:07.046
and a lot of sheep.

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:10.365
But then, living in two extremes

00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:14.394
between the traditions 
of my culture, of my village,

00:02:14.394 --> 00:02:17.745
and then modern education
in my school wasn't easy.

00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:22.249
I was aware that I was the only girl
who got to have such freedom,

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:24.293
and I was guilty of it.

00:02:24.293 --> 00:02:28.255
While going to school
in Karachi and Hyderabad,

00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:32.196
a lot of my cousins and childhood friends
were getting married off,

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:34.950
some to older men, some in exchange,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.249
some even as second wives.

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:42.558
I got to see the beautiful tradition
and its magic fade in front of me

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:47.892
when I saw that the birth of a girl child
was celebrated with sadness,

00:02:47.892 --> 00:02:52.659
when women were told
to have patience as their main virtue.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.640
Up until I was 16,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.448
I healed my sadness by crying,

00:02:57.448 --> 00:02:59.634
mostly at nights 
when everyone would sleep

00:02:59.634 --> 00:03:01.950
and I would sob in my pillow,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.297
until that one night 
when I found out my friend was killed

00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:07.471
in the name of honor.

00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:11.218
Honor killings is a custom

00:03:11.218 --> 00:03:14.116
where men and women
are suspected of having relationships

00:03:14.116 --> 00:03:15.811
before or outside of the marriage,

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:17.990
and they're killed by their family for it.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.375
Usually the killer is the brother
or father or the uncle in the family.

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:27.007
The U.N. reports there are about 1,000
honor murders every year in Pakistan,

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:29.445
and these are only the reported cases.

00:03:29.445 --> 00:03:33.183
A custom that kills
did not make any sense to me,

00:03:33.183 --> 00:03:35.761
and I knew I had to do
something about it this time.

00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:38.152
I was not going to cry myself to sleep.

00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:40.660
I was going to do something,
anything, to stop it.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.726
I was 16 -- I started writing poetry

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:45.954
and going door to door
telling everybody about honor killings

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:48.149
and why it happens,
why it should be stopped,

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:49.585
and raising awareness about it

00:03:49.585 --> 00:03:54.162
until I actually found a much, much 
better way to handle this issue.

00:03:54.841 --> 00:04:01.002
In those days, we were living in
a very small, one-roomed house in Karachi.

00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:05.529
Every year, during the monsoon seasons,
our house would flood up with water --

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.236
rainwater and sewage --

00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:10.368
and my mom and dad
would be taking the water out.

00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:15.467
In those days, my dad brought home
a huge machine, a computer.

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:20.364
It was so big it looked as if it was going
to take up half of the only room we had,

00:04:20.364 --> 00:04:23.864
and had so many pieces and wires
that needed to be connected.

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:25.954
But it was still the most exciting thing

00:04:25.954 --> 00:04:28.740
that has ever happened
to me and my sisters.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.850
My oldest brother Ali got to be in charge
of taking care of the computer,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.785
and all of us were given
10 to 15 minutes every day to use it.

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:39.850
Being the oldest of eight kids,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.335
I got to use it the last,

00:04:42.335 --> 00:04:45.074
and that was after
I had washed the dishes,

00:04:45.074 --> 00:04:47.837
cleaned the house,
made dinner with my mom,

00:04:47.837 --> 00:04:50.529
and put blankets on the floor
for everyone to sleep,

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:52.712
and after that, 
I would run to the computer,

00:04:52.712 --> 00:04:54.269
connect it to the Internet,

00:04:54.269 --> 00:05:00.288
and have pure joy and wonder
for 10 to 15 minutes.

00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:04.694
In those days, I had discovered
a website called Joogle.

00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:07.760
[Google] (Laughter)

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.474
In my frantic wish
to do something about this custom,

00:05:11.474 --> 00:05:14.982
I made use of Google
and discovered Facebook,

00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:19.137
a website where people can connect
to anyone around the world,

00:05:19.137 --> 00:05:23.618
and so, from my very tiny,
cement-roofed room in Karachi,

00:05:23.618 --> 00:05:26.828
I connected with people in the U.K.,
the U.S., Australia and Canada,

00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:29.335
and created a campaign called

00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:32.228
WAKE UP Campaign
against Honor Killings.

00:05:32.228 --> 00:05:35.299
It became enormous
in just a few months.

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:37.851
I got a lot of support
from all around the world.

00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:39.312
Media was connecting to us.

00:05:39.312 --> 00:05:42.611
A lot of people were reaching out
trying to raise awareness with us.

00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:47.353
It became so big that it went from online
to the streets of my hometown,

00:05:47.353 --> 00:05:49.697
where we would do rallies and strikes

00:05:49.697 --> 00:05:53.169
trying to change the policies 
in Pakistan for women's support.

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.891
And while I thought
everything was perfect,

00:05:56.891 --> 00:06:00.768
my team -- which was basically
my friends and neighbors at that time --

00:06:00.768 --> 00:06:02.858
thought everything was going so well,

00:06:02.858 --> 00:06:07.259
we had no idea a big opposition
was coming to us.

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.174
My community stood up against us,

00:06:10.174 --> 00:06:13.891
saying we were spreading
un-Islamic behavior.

00:06:13.891 --> 00:06:18.601
We were challenging centuries-old
customs in those communities.

00:06:18.601 --> 00:06:21.679
I remember my father receiving
anonymous letters

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:24.615
saying, "Your daughter 
is spreading Western culture

00:06:24.615 --> 00:06:26.341
in the honorable societies."

00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:28.887
Our car was stoned at one point.

00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:32.787
One day I went to the office
and found our metal signboard

00:06:32.787 --> 00:06:37.589
wrinkled and broken as if a lot of people
had been hitting it with something heavy.

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:41.216
Things got so bad that I had
to hide myself in many ways.

00:06:41.216 --> 00:06:44.293
I would put up the windows of the car,

00:06:44.293 --> 00:06:48.225
veil my face, not speak
while I was in public,

00:06:48.225 --> 00:06:52.202
but eventually situations got worse
when my life was threatened,

00:06:52.202 --> 00:06:56.768
and I had to leave, back to Karachi,
and our actions stopped.

00:06:57.962 --> 00:07:01.335
Back in Karachi, as an 18-year-old,

00:07:01.335 --> 00:07:06.101
I thought this was the biggest
failure of my entire life.

00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.011
I was devastated.

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:11.656
As a teenager, I was blaming
myself for everything that happened.

00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:13.792
And it turns out,
when we started reflecting,

00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:19.666
we did realize that it was actually
me and my team's fault.

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:24.821
There were two big reasons
why our campaign had failed big time.

00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:27.071
One of those, the first reason,

00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:29.700
is we were standing
against core values of people.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.412
We were saying no to something
that was very important to them,

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:36.759
challenging their code of honor,

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:39.026
and hurting them deeply in the process.

00:07:39.026 --> 00:07:41.725
And number two, which was very
important for me to learn,

00:07:41.725 --> 00:07:43.930
and amazing, and surprising
for me to learn,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.111
was that we were not including
the true heroes

00:07:47.111 --> 00:07:49.317
who should be fighting for themselves.

00:07:49.317 --> 00:07:53.274
The women in the villages had no idea
we were fighting for them in the streets.

00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:54.711
Every time I would go back,

00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:57.718
I would find my cousins and friends
with scarves on their faces,

00:07:57.718 --> 00:07:59.512
and I would ask, "What happened?"

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.902
And they'd be like, 
"Our husbands beat us."

00:08:01.902 --> 00:08:04.781
But we are working in the streets for you!

00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:06.383
We are changing the policies.

00:08:06.383 --> 00:08:09.355
How is that not impacting their life?

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:14.206
So then we found out something
which was very amazing for us.

00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:16.856
The policies of a country

00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:21.467
do not necessarily always affect
the tribal and rural communities.

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:25.771
It was devastating -- like, oh,
we can't actually do something about this?

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:28.813
And we found out there's a huge gap

00:08:28.813 --> 00:08:32.649
when it comes to official policies
and the real truth on the ground.

00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:35.961
So this time, we were like,
we are going to do something different.

00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:37.710
We are going to use strategy,

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.699
and we are going to go back and apologize.

00:08:40.699 --> 00:08:42.350
Yes, apologize.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.863
We went back to the communities

00:08:43.863 --> 00:08:47.111
and we said we are 
very ashamed of what we did.

00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:51.681
We are here to apologize, and in fact,
we are here to make it up to you.

00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:53.251
How do we do that?

00:08:53.251 --> 00:08:56.217
We are going to promote
three of your main cultures.

00:08:56.217 --> 00:08:59.799
We know that it's music,
language, and embroidery.

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:01.325
Nobody believed us.

00:09:01.325 --> 00:09:04.063
Nobody wanted to work with us.

00:09:04.063 --> 00:09:07.618
It took a lot of convincing
and discussions with these communities

00:09:07.618 --> 00:09:11.310
until they agreed that we are going
to promote their language

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.972
by making a booklet of their stories,
fables and old tales in the tribe,

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:18.544
and we would promote their music

00:09:18.544 --> 00:09:24.055
by making a CD of the songs
from the tribe, and some drumbeating.

00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:26.216
And the third, which was my favorite,

00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:30.227
was we would promote their embroidery
by making a center in the village

00:09:30.227 --> 00:09:33.362
where women would come every day
to make embroidery.

00:09:34.064 --> 00:09:36.038
And so it began.

00:09:36.038 --> 00:09:40.040
We worked with one village,
and we started our first center.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.268
It was a beautiful day.

00:09:42.268 --> 00:09:43.372
We started the center.

00:09:43.372 --> 00:09:45.441
Women were coming to make embroidery,

00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:49.185
and going through a life-changing
process of education,

00:09:49.185 --> 00:09:52.235
learning about their rights,
what Islam says about their rights,

00:09:52.235 --> 00:09:55.054
and enterprise development,
how they can create money,

00:09:55.054 --> 00:09:57.306
and then how they can create
money from money,

00:09:57.306 --> 00:10:01.184
how they can fight the customs
that have been destroying their lives

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:02.902
from so many centuries,

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:04.758
because in Islam, in reality,

00:10:04.758 --> 00:10:08.373
women are supposed to be
shoulder to shoulder with men.

00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:12.125
Women have so much status
that we have not been hearing,

00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:13.938
that they have not been hearing,

00:10:13.938 --> 00:10:16.956
and we needed to tell them
that they need to know

00:10:16.956 --> 00:10:19.696
where their rights are
and how to take them by themselves,

00:10:19.696 --> 00:10:22.021
because they can do it and we can't.

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.993
So this was the model which actually
came out -- very amazing.

00:10:24.993 --> 00:10:27.526
Through embroidery
we were promoting their traditions.

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:30.237
We went into the village.
We would mobilize the community.

00:10:30.237 --> 00:10:33.257
We would make a center inside
where 30 women will come

00:10:33.257 --> 00:10:37.365
for six months to learn about
value addition of traditional embroidery,

00:10:37.365 --> 00:10:41.104
enterprise development,
life skills and basic education,

00:10:41.104 --> 00:10:44.215
and about their rights
and how to say no to those customs

00:10:44.215 --> 00:10:47.886
and how to stand as leaders
for themselves and the society.

00:10:47.886 --> 00:10:52.698
After six months, we would connect
these women to loans and to markets

00:10:52.698 --> 00:10:56.608
where they can become
local entrepreneurs in their communities.

00:10:56.608 --> 00:10:59.865
We soon called this project Sughar.

00:10:59.865 --> 00:11:03.905
Sughar is a local word used
in many, many languages in Pakistan.

00:11:03.905 --> 00:11:07.341
It means skilled and confident women.

00:11:07.341 --> 00:11:12.449
I truly believe, to create women leaders,
there's only one thing you have to do:

00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:16.631
Just let them know that they have
what it takes to be a leader.

00:11:16.631 --> 00:11:18.130
These women you see here,

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.573
they have strong skills
and potential to be leaders.

00:11:22.573 --> 00:11:25.615
All we had to do was remove
the barriers that surrounded them,

00:11:25.615 --> 00:11:28.154
and that's what we decided to do.

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:31.443
But then while we were thinking
everything was going well,

00:11:31.443 --> 00:11:34.043
once again everything was fantastic,

00:11:34.043 --> 00:11:36.110
we found our next setback:

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.279
A lot of men started seeing
the visible changes in their wife.

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:41.420
She's speaking more,
she's making decisions --

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.109
oh my gosh, she's handling 
everything in the house.

00:11:44.109 --> 00:11:48.578
They stopped them
from coming to the centers,

00:11:48.578 --> 00:11:52.622
and this time, we were like,
okay, time for strategy two.

00:11:52.622 --> 00:11:54.710
We went to the fashion 
industry in Pakistan

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.493
and decided to do research
about what happens there.

00:11:58.493 --> 00:12:03.480
Turns out the fashion industry in Pakistan
is very strong and growing day by day,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.046
but there is less contribution
from the tribal areas

00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:10.121
and to the tribal areas, especially women.

00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:14.555
So we decided to launch our first ever
tribal women's very own fashion brand,

00:12:14.555 --> 00:12:17.185
which is now called Nomads.

00:12:18.085 --> 00:12:20.267
And so women started earning more,

00:12:20.267 --> 00:12:23.073
they started contributing more
financially to the house,

00:12:23.073 --> 00:12:26.304
and men had to think again
before saying no to them

00:12:26.304 --> 00:12:28.363
when they were coming to the centers.

00:12:31.343 --> 00:12:34.106
(Applause)

00:12:34.106 --> 00:12:36.265
Thank you, thank you.

00:12:36.265 --> 00:12:41.442
In 2013, we launched our first
Sughar Hub instead of a center.

00:12:41.442 --> 00:12:43.602
We partnered with TripAdvisor

00:12:43.602 --> 00:12:47.514
and created a cement hall
in the middle of a village

00:12:47.514 --> 00:12:51.752
and invited so many other organizations
to work over there.

00:12:51.752 --> 00:12:53.847
We created this platform
for the nonprofits

00:12:53.847 --> 00:12:56.170
so they can touch and work
on the other issues

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.395
that Sughar is not working on,

00:12:58.395 --> 00:13:02.259
which would be an easy place 
for them to give trainings,

00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:04.874
use it as a farmer school,
even as a marketplace,

00:13:04.874 --> 00:13:07.146
and anything they want to use it for,

00:13:07.146 --> 00:13:09.259
and they have been doing really amazingly.

00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:12.789
And so far, we have been able
to support 900 women

00:13:12.789 --> 00:13:16.039
in 24 villages around Pakistan.

00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:20.544
(Applause)

00:13:21.624 --> 00:13:24.568
But that's actually not what I want.

00:13:26.758 --> 00:13:31.410
My dream is to reach out
to one million women in the next 10 years,

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.059
and to make sure that happens,

00:13:33.059 --> 00:13:36.047
this year we launched
Sughar Foundation in the U.S.

00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:40.811
It is not just going to fund Sughar
but many other organizations in Pakistan

00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:43.020
to replicate the idea

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.760
and to find even more innovative ways

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.591
to unleash the rural women's
potential in Pakistan.

00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:51.564
Thank you so much.

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:54.606
(Applause)

00:13:54.606 --> 00:13:57.336
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:13:59.056 --> 00:14:02.359
Chris Anderson: Khalida, you are
quite the force of nature.

00:14:02.359 --> 00:14:06.982
I mean, this story, in many ways,
just seems beyond belief.

00:14:06.982 --> 00:14:11.042
It's incredible that someone
so young could do achieve this much

00:14:11.042 --> 00:14:13.900
through so much force and ingenuity.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.470
So I guess one question:

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:20.181
This is a spectacular dream to reach out
and empower a million women --

00:14:20.181 --> 00:14:23.975
how much of the current 
success depends on you,

00:14:23.975 --> 00:14:28.208
the force of this magnetic personality?

00:14:28.218 --> 00:14:30.848
How does it scale?

00:14:30.858 --> 00:14:35.344
Khalida Brohi: I think my job
is to give the inspiration out,

00:14:35.344 --> 00:14:37.065
give my dream out.

00:14:37.065 --> 00:14:40.487
I can't teach how to do it, because
there are so many different ways.

00:14:40.487 --> 00:14:42.792
We have been experimenting
with three ways only.

00:14:42.792 --> 00:14:46.385
There are a hundred different ways
to unleash potential in women.

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:49.033
I would just give the inspiration
and that's my job.

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:51.507
I will keep doing it.
Sughar will still be growing.

00:14:51.507 --> 00:14:54.595
We are planning to reach out
to two more villages,

00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:57.575
and soon I believe 
we will be scaling out of Pakistan

00:14:57.575 --> 00:15:00.361
into South Asia and beyond.

00:15:00.361 --> 00:15:03.914
CA: I love that when you talked
about your team in the talk,

00:15:03.914 --> 00:15:06.096
I mean, you were all 18 at the time.

00:15:06.096 --> 00:15:07.861
What did this team look like?

00:15:07.861 --> 00:15:09.509
This was school friends, right?

00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:14.478
KB: Do people here
believe that I'm at an age

00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:17.522
where I'm supposed
to be a grandmother in my village?

00:15:17.522 --> 00:15:23.412
My mom was married at nine,
and I am the oldest woman not married

00:15:23.412 --> 00:15:26.988
and not doing anything
in my life in my village.

00:15:26.988 --> 00:15:30.285
CA: Wait, wait, wait, not doing anything?

00:15:30.285 --> 00:15:32.653
KB: No.
CA: You're right.

00:15:32.653 --> 00:15:35.556
KB: People feel sorry for me,
a lot of times.

00:15:35.556 --> 00:15:39.480
CA: But how much time are you spending
now actually back in Balochistan?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.367
KB: I live over there.

00:15:41.367 --> 00:15:44.199
We live between, still,
Karachi and Balochistan.

00:15:44.199 --> 00:15:46.983
My siblings are all going to school.

00:15:46.983 --> 00:15:49.424
I am still the oldest of eight siblings.

00:15:49.424 --> 00:15:53.784
CA: But what you're doing is definitely
threatening to some people there.

00:15:53.784 --> 00:15:58.140
How do you handle safety?
Do you feel safe?

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.265
Are there issues there?

00:16:00.265 --> 00:16:04.075
KB: This question has come to me
a lot of times before,

00:16:04.075 --> 00:16:10.390
and I feel like the word "fear"
just comes to me and then drops,

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:14.120
but there is one fear that I have
that is different from that.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.623
The fear is that if I get killed,
what would happen to the people

00:16:17.623 --> 00:16:19.608
who love me so much?

00:16:19.608 --> 00:16:23.840
My mom waits for me till late at night
that I should come home.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.585
My sisters want to learn so much from me,

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:29.846
and there are many, many girls
in my community who want to talk to me

00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:32.119
and ask me different things,

00:16:32.119 --> 00:16:34.910
and I recently got engaged. (Laughs)

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.324
(Applause)

00:16:37.324 --> 00:16:40.552

KB: Escaping arranged marriages,
I chose my own husband

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.178
across the world in L.A.,
a really different world.

00:16:56.178 --> 00:16:59.444
I had to fight for a whole year.
That's totally a different story.

00:16:59.444 --> 00:17:04.189
But I think that's
the only thing that I'm afraid of,

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:09.933

when she waits in the night.

to help you on their way,

00:17:12.404 --> 00:17:15.077
they can go on, they can maybe
buy some of these clothes

00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:17.649
that you're bringing over

00:17:17.649 --> 00:17:21.161

is done back in Balochistan?

KB: Definitely. We are looking
for as many people as we can,

00:17:27.419 --> 00:17:31.117
because now that the foundation's
in the beginning process,

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:33.708
I am trying to learn a lot
about how to operate,

00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:38.087
how to get funding
or reach out to more organizations,

00:17:38.087 --> 00:17:41.245
and especially in the e-commerce,
which is very new for me.

00:17:41.245 --> 00:17:43.632
I mean, I am not
a fashion person, believe me.

00:17:43.632 --> 00:17:46.929
CA: Well, it's been incredible
to have you here.

00:17:46.929 --> 00:17:51.944

go on being smart, and please stay safe.
