00:00:00.507 --> 00:00:05.176
Today I want to talk to you
about the mathematics of love.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.829
Now, I think that we can all agree

00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:10.162
that mathematicians
are famously excellent at finding love.

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:11.882
(Laughter)

00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:14.873
But it's not just because
of our dashing personalities,

00:00:14.897 --> 00:00:19.520
superior conversational skills
and excellent pencil cases.

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:23.826
It's also because we've actually done
an awful lot of work into the maths

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.326
of how to find the perfect partner.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.029
Now, in my favorite paper
on the subject, which is entitled,

00:00:30.053 --> 00:00:31.916
"Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend" --

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.347
(Laughter)

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:36.989
Peter Backus tries to rate
his chances of finding love.

00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:39.242
Now, Peter's not a very greedy man.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.518
Of all of the available women in the UK,

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:45.037
all Peter's looking for
is somebody who lives near him,

00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:46.867
somebody in the right age range,

00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:49.813
somebody with a university degree,

00:00:49.837 --> 00:00:51.819
somebody he's likely to get on well with,

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.786
somebody who's likely to be attractive,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.116
somebody who's likely
to find him attractive.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.194
(Laughter)

00:00:59.218 --> 00:01:04.008
And comes up with an estimate
of 26 women in the whole of the UK.

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:05.211
(Laughter)

00:01:05.235 --> 00:01:07.268
It's not looking very good, is it Peter?

00:01:07.292 --> 00:01:09.246
Now, just to put that into perspective,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.550
that's about 400 times fewer
than the best estimates

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:16.275
of how many intelligent
extraterrestrial life forms there are.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.593
And it also gives Peter
a 1 in 285,000 chance

00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:23.878
of bumping into any one
of these special ladies

00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:25.441
on a given night out.

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:27.467
I'd like to think
that's why mathematicians

00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:29.949
don't really bother
going on nights out anymore.

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.365
The thing is that I personally
don't subscribe

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:35.045
to such a pessimistic view.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.658
Because I know,
just as well as all of you do,

00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:40.054
that love doesn't really work like that.

00:01:40.078 --> 00:01:44.928
Human emotion isn't neatly ordered
and rational and easily predictable.

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:47.617
But I also know that that doesn't mean

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.921
that mathematics hasn't got something
that it can offer us,

00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:54.691
because, love, as with most of life,
is full of patterns

00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:59.141
and mathematics is, ultimately,
all about the study of patterns.

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:03.509
Patterns from predicting the weather
to the fluctuations in the stock market,

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:06.564
to the movement of the planets
or the growth of cities.

00:02:06.588 --> 00:02:08.878
And if we're being honest,
none of those things

00:02:08.902 --> 00:02:12.064
are exactly neatly ordered
and easily predictable, either.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:18.144
Because I believe that mathematics
is so powerful that it has the potential

00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:21.489
to offer us a new way of looking
at almost anything.

00:02:21.513 --> 00:02:24.333
Even something as mysterious as love.

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.651
And so, to try to persuade you

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:31.368
of how totally amazing, excellent
and relevant mathematics is,

00:02:31.392 --> 00:02:38.075
I want to give you my top three
mathematically verifiable tips for love.

00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:40.416
(Laughter)

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.080
OK, so Top Tip #1:

00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:44.221
How to win at online dating.

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:49.938
So my favorite online dating
website is OkCupid,

00:02:49.962 --> 00:02:53.550
not least because it was started
by a group of mathematicians.

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.319
Now, because they're mathematicians,

00:02:55.343 --> 00:02:56.820
they have been collecting data

00:02:56.844 --> 00:03:00.340
on everybody who uses their site
for almost a decade.

00:03:00.364 --> 00:03:02.514
And they've been trying
to search for patterns

00:03:02.538 --> 00:03:04.401
in the way that we talk about ourselves

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:06.484
and the way that we interact
with each other

00:03:06.508 --> 00:03:07.852
on an online dating website.

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:10.801
And they've come up with some
seriously interesting findings.

00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:12.423
But my particular favorite

00:03:12.447 --> 00:03:15.803
is that it turns out
that on an online dating website,

00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:21.487
how attractive you are
does not dictate how popular you are,

00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:25.367
and actually, having people
think that you're ugly

00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:27.286
can work to your advantage.

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.619
(Laughter)

00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:30.313
Let me show you how this works.

00:03:30.337 --> 00:03:34.716
In a thankfully voluntary
section of OkCupid,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.541
you are allowed to rate
how attractive you think people are

00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:39.850
on a scale between one and five.

00:03:39.874 --> 00:03:42.855
Now, if we compare this score,
the average score,

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.020
to how many messages
a selection of people receive,

00:03:46.044 --> 00:03:47.567
you can begin to get a sense

00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:51.999
of how attractiveness links to popularity
on an online dating website.

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:55.365
This is the graph the OkCupid guys
have come up with.

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.383
And the important thing to notice
is that it's not totally true

00:03:58.407 --> 00:04:01.232
that the more attractive you are,
the more messages you get.

00:04:01.256 --> 00:04:05.511
But the question arises then
of what is it about people up here

00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:09.398
who are so much more popular
than people down here,

00:04:09.422 --> 00:04:12.518
even though they have the same
score of attractiveness?

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:16.675
And the reason why is that it's not just
straightforward looks that are important.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.506
So let me try to illustrate
their findings with an example.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.448
So if you take someone like
Portia de Rossi, for example,

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:27.952
everybody agrees that Portia de Rossi
is a very beautiful woman.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:31.694
Nobody thinks that she's ugly,
but she's not a supermodel, either.

00:04:31.718 --> 00:04:36.309
If you compare Portia de Rossi
to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker,

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:40.015
now, a lot of people,
myself included, I should say,

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.296
think that Sarah Jessica Parker
is seriously fabulous

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.966
and possibly one
of the most beautiful creatures

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.380
to have ever have walked
on the face of the Earth.

00:04:49.404 --> 00:04:54.169
But some other people,
i.e., most of the Internet ...

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:56.263
(Laughter)

00:04:56.287 --> 00:04:58.673
seem to think that she looks
a bit like a horse.

00:04:58.697 --> 00:05:01.486
(Laughter)

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.603
Now, I think that if you ask people
how attractive they thought

00:05:05.627 --> 00:05:07.535
Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were,

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:10.467
and you ask them to give
them a score between one and five

00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:13.511
I reckon that they'd average out
to have roughly the same score.

00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:16.299
But the way that people would vote
would be very different.

00:05:16.323 --> 00:05:19.025
So Portia's scores would
all be clustered around the four

00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:21.480
because everybody agrees
that she's very beautiful,

00:05:21.504 --> 00:05:24.218
whereas Sarah Jessica Parker
completely divides opinion.

00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:26.218
There'd be a huge spread in her scores.

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:28.591
And actually it's this spread that counts.

00:05:28.615 --> 00:05:30.841
It's this spread
that makes you more popular

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:33.041
on an online Internet dating website.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:34.253
So what that means then

00:05:34.277 --> 00:05:36.882
is that if some people
think that you're attractive,

00:05:36.906 --> 00:05:38.767
you're actually better off

00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:42.738
having some other people
think that you're a massive minger.

00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:46.149
That's much better
than everybody just thinking

00:05:46.173 --> 00:05:48.236
that you're the cute girl next door.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.585
Now, I think this begins
to make a bit more sense

00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:53.879
when you think in terms of the people
who are sending these messages.

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:56.261
So let's say that you think
somebody's attractive,

00:05:56.285 --> 00:06:00.250
but you suspect that other people
won't necessarily be that interested.

00:06:00.274 --> 00:06:02.519
That means there's
less competition for you

00:06:02.543 --> 00:06:05.325
and it's an extra incentive
for you to get in touch.

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.134
Whereas compare that
to if you think somebody is attractive

00:06:08.158 --> 00:06:11.375
but you suspect that everybody
is going to think they're attractive.

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:14.604
Well, why would you bother
humiliating yourself, let's be honest?

00:06:15.077 --> 00:06:17.470
But here's where the really
interesting part comes.

00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:21.674
Because when people choose the pictures
that they use on an online dating website,

00:06:21.698 --> 00:06:23.874
they often try to minimize the things

00:06:23.898 --> 00:06:27.136
that they think some people
will find unattractive.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.191
The classic example is people
who are, perhaps, a little bit overweight

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:33.657
deliberately choosing
a very cropped photo,

00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:35.032
(Laughter)

00:06:35.056 --> 00:06:36.816
or bald men, for example,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.788
deliberately choosing pictures
where they're wearing hats.

00:06:39.812 --> 00:06:42.402
But actually this is the opposite
of what you should do

00:06:42.426 --> 00:06:43.816
if you want to be successful.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.174
You should really, instead,

00:06:45.198 --> 00:06:48.356
play up to whatever it is
that makes you different,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.531
even if you think that some people
will find it unattractive.

00:06:52.555 --> 00:06:55.766
Because the people who fancy you
are just going to fancy you anyway,

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.346
and the unimportant losers who don't,
well, they only play up to your advantage.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.923
OK, Top Tip #2:
How to pick the perfect partner.

00:07:02.947 --> 00:07:05.600
So let's imagine then
that you're a roaring success

00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:07.165
on the dating scene.

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:11.724
But the question arises
of how do you then convert that success

00:07:11.748 --> 00:07:14.299
into longer-term happiness,

00:07:14.323 --> 00:07:19.413
and in particular, how do you decide
when is the right time to settle down?

00:07:19.437 --> 00:07:22.245
Now generally,
it's not advisable to just cash in

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:26.392
and marry the first person who comes along
and shows you any interest at all.

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:29.537
But, equally, you don't really
want to leave it too long

00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:32.331
if you want to maximize your chance
of long-term happiness.

00:07:32.355 --> 00:07:35.819
As my favorite author,
Jane Austen, puts it,

00:07:35.843 --> 00:07:38.037
"An unmarried woman of seven and twenty

00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:41.493
can never hope to feel
or inspire affection again."

00:07:41.517 --> 00:07:44.182
(Laughter)

00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:45.388
Thanks a lot, Jane.

00:07:45.412 --> 00:07:46.825
What do you know about love?

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:47.932
(Laughter)

00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:49.865
So the question is then,

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:52.478
how do you know when
is the right time to settle down,

00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:55.130
given all the people
that you can date in your lifetime?

00:07:55.154 --> 00:07:58.604
Thankfully, there's a rather delicious bit
of mathematics that we can use

00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:01.172
to help us out here,
called optimal stopping theory.

00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:03.177
So let's imagine, then,

00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:05.803
that you start dating when you're 15

00:08:05.827 --> 00:08:09.596
and ideally, you'd like to be married
by the time that you're 35.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.062
And there's a number of people

00:08:11.086 --> 00:08:13.583
that you could potentially
date across your lifetime,

00:08:13.607 --> 00:08:15.735
and they'll be at varying
levels of goodness.

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:18.424
Now the rules are that once
you cash in and get married,

00:08:18.448 --> 00:08:20.878
you can't look ahead to see
what you could have had,

00:08:20.902 --> 00:08:23.435
and equally, you can't go back
and change your mind.

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:25.058
In my experience at least,

00:08:25.082 --> 00:08:27.880
I find that typically people
don't much like being recalled

00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:33.122
years after being passed up
for somebody else, or that's just me.

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:36.339
So the math says then
that what you should do

00:08:36.363 --> 00:08:39.534
in the first 37 percent
of your dating window,

00:08:39.558 --> 00:08:43.315
you should just reject everybody
as serious marriage potential.

00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:45.489
(Laughter)

00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:49.137
And then, you should pick
the next person that comes along

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:52.130
that is better than everybody
that you've seen before.

00:08:52.154 --> 00:08:53.575
So here's the example.

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:56.466
Now if you do this, it can be
mathematically proven, in fact,

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.951
that this is the best possible way

00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:03.304
of maximizing your chances
of finding the perfect partner.

00:09:03.328 --> 00:09:07.909
Now unfortunately, I have to tell you that
this method does come with some risks.

00:09:08.604 --> 00:09:13.413
For instance, imagine
if your perfect partner appeared

00:09:13.437 --> 00:09:16.119
during your first 37 percent.

00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:18.915
Now, unfortunately,
you'd have to reject them.

00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:21.628
(Laughter)

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:24.244
Now, if you're following the maths,

00:09:24.268 --> 00:09:25.901
I'm afraid no one else comes along

00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:28.196
that's better than anyone
you've seen before,

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.069
so you have to go on
rejecting everyone and die alone.

00:09:32.093 --> 00:09:34.092
(Laughter)

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.076
Probably surrounded by cats ...

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.719
(Laughter)

00:09:37.838 --> 00:09:39.405
nibbling at your remains.

00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:43.398
OK, another risk is,
let's imagine, instead,

00:09:43.422 --> 00:09:46.538
that the first people that you dated
in your first 37 percent

00:09:46.562 --> 00:09:50.483
are just incredibly dull,
boring, terrible people.

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:53.221
That's OK, because
you're in your rejection phase,

00:09:53.245 --> 00:09:54.960
so that's fine, you can reject them.

00:09:54.984 --> 00:09:58.357
But then imagine
the next person to come along

00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:01.711
is just marginally less boring,
dull and terrible ...

00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:02.834
(Laughter)

00:10:02.858 --> 00:10:04.756
than everybody that you've seen before.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.375
Now, if you are following the maths,
I'm afraid you have to marry them ...

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.454
(Laughter)

00:10:09.478 --> 00:10:12.621
and end up in a relationship
which is, frankly, suboptimal.

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:13.798
Sorry about that.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:17.322
But I do think that there's an opportunity
here for Hallmark to cash in on

00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:18.928
and really cater for this market.

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.535
A Valentine's Day card like this.

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.715
(Laughter)

00:10:21.739 --> 00:10:24.741
"My darling husband,
you are marginally less terrible

00:10:24.765 --> 00:10:26.919
than the first 37 percent
of people I dated."

00:10:26.943 --> 00:10:28.573
(Laughter)

00:10:28.597 --> 00:10:31.435
It's actually more romantic
than I normally manage.

00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:33.216
(Laughter)

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.901
OK, so this method doesn't give you
a 100 percent success rate,

00:10:37.925 --> 00:10:41.360
but there's no other possible
strategy that can do any better.

00:10:41.384 --> 00:10:44.814
And actually, in the wild,
there are certain types of fish

00:10:44.838 --> 00:10:47.655
which follow and employ
this exact strategy.

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:50.432
So they reject every possible
suitor that turns up

00:10:50.456 --> 00:10:53.145
in the first 37 percent
of the mating season,

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:56.920
and then they pick the next fish
that comes along after that window

00:10:56.944 --> 00:10:59.099
that's, I don't know, bigger and burlier

00:10:59.123 --> 00:11:01.701
than all of the fish
that they've seen before.

00:11:01.725 --> 00:11:06.602
I also think that subconsciously,
humans, we do sort of do this anyway.

00:11:06.626 --> 00:11:09.471
We give ourselves a little bit of time
to play the field,

00:11:09.495 --> 00:11:13.091
get a feel for the marketplace
or whatever when we're young.

00:11:13.115 --> 00:11:17.705
And then we only start looking seriously
at potential marriage candidates

00:11:17.729 --> 00:11:19.756
once we hit our mid-to-late 20s.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.990
I think this is conclusive proof,
if ever it were needed,

00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:27.222
that everybody's brains are prewired
to be just a little bit mathematical.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.453
OK, so that was Top Tip #2.

00:11:29.477 --> 00:11:32.706
Now, Top Tip #3: How to avoid divorce.

00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:36.275
OK, so let's imagine then
that you picked your perfect partner

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:40.528
and you're settling into
a lifelong relationship with them.

00:11:40.552 --> 00:11:44.538
Now, I like to think that everybody
would ideally like to avoid divorce,

00:11:44.562 --> 00:11:48.808
apart from, I don't know,
Piers Morgan's wife, maybe?

00:11:48.832 --> 00:11:49.982
(Laughter)

00:11:50.185 --> 00:11:52.605
But it's a sad fact of modern life

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:55.889
that one in two marriages
in the States ends in divorce,

00:11:55.913 --> 00:11:59.705
with the rest of the world
not being far behind.

00:11:59.729 --> 00:12:01.563
Now, you can be forgiven, perhaps

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:05.320
for thinking that the arguments
that precede a marital breakup

00:12:05.344 --> 00:12:09.134
are not an ideal candidate
for mathematical investigation.

00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:11.141
For one thing, it's very hard to know

00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:14.242
what you should be measuring
or what you should be quantifying.

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:20.449
But this didn't stop a psychologist,
John Gottman, who did exactly that.

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:25.710
Gottman observed hundreds of couples
having a conversation

00:12:25.734 --> 00:12:28.040
and recorded, well,
everything you can think of.

00:12:28.064 --> 00:12:30.431
So he recorded what was said
in the conversation,

00:12:30.455 --> 00:12:32.748
he recorded their skin conductivity,

00:12:32.772 --> 00:12:34.835
he recorded their facial expressions,

00:12:34.859 --> 00:12:36.850
their heart rates, their blood pressure,

00:12:36.874 --> 00:12:43.110
basically everything apart from whether
or not the wife was actually always right,

00:12:43.134 --> 00:12:46.325
which incidentally she totally is.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:48.998
But what Gottman and his team found

00:12:49.022 --> 00:12:52.037
was that one of the most
important predictors

00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:54.543
for whether or not a couple
is going to get divorced

00:12:54.567 --> 00:12:59.190
was how positive or negative each partner
was being in the conversation.

00:12:59.214 --> 00:13:01.544
Now, couples that were very low-risk

00:13:01.568 --> 00:13:05.837
scored a lot more positive points
on Gottman's scale than negative.

00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:08.402
Whereas bad relationships,

00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:11.173
by which I mean,
probably going to get divorced,

00:13:11.197 --> 00:13:15.554
they found themselves getting
into a spiral of negativity.

00:13:15.578 --> 00:13:17.838
Now just by using these very simple ideas,

00:13:17.862 --> 00:13:20.333
Gottman and his group were able to predict

00:13:20.357 --> 00:13:23.079
whether a given couple
was going to get divorced

00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:25.288
with a 90 percent accuracy.

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:29.294
But it wasn't until he teamed up
with a mathematician, James Murray,

00:13:29.318 --> 00:13:31.209
that they really started to understand

00:13:31.233 --> 00:13:35.727
what causes these negativity spirals
and how they occur.

00:13:35.751 --> 00:13:37.284
And the results that they found,

00:13:37.308 --> 00:13:41.957
I think, are just incredibly
impressively simple and interesting.

00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:46.544
So these equations predict how the wife
or husband is going to respond

00:13:46.568 --> 00:13:48.456
in their next turn of the conversation,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.613
how positive or negative
they're going to be.

00:13:50.637 --> 00:13:52.022
And these equations depend on

00:13:52.046 --> 00:13:54.352
the mood of the person
when they're on their own,

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.990
the mood of the person when
they're with their partner,

00:13:57.014 --> 00:13:58.739
but most importantly, they depend on

00:13:58.763 --> 00:14:01.795
how much the husband and wife
influence one another.

00:14:02.115 --> 00:14:04.722
Now, I think it's important
to point out at this stage,

00:14:04.746 --> 00:14:08.255
that these exact equations
have also been shown

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:10.474
to be perfectly able at describing

00:14:10.498 --> 00:14:14.232
what happens between two countries
in an arms race.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.098
(Laughter)

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.881
So that an arguing couple
spiraling into negativity

00:14:21.905 --> 00:14:23.810
and teetering on the brink of divorce

00:14:23.834 --> 00:14:28.083
is actually mathematically equivalent
to the beginning of a nuclear war.

00:14:28.107 --> 00:14:30.997
(Laughter)

00:14:31.021 --> 00:14:33.334
But the really important term
in this equation

00:14:33.358 --> 00:14:35.853
is the influence that people
have on one another,

00:14:35.877 --> 00:14:39.134
and in particular, something called
"the negativity threshold."

00:14:39.158 --> 00:14:40.890
Now, the negativity threshold,

00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:45.541
you can think of as
how annoying the husband can be

00:14:45.565 --> 00:14:49.828
before the wife starts to get
really pissed off, and vice versa.

00:14:49.852 --> 00:14:54.384
Now, I always thought that good marriages
were about compromise and understanding

00:14:54.408 --> 00:14:57.170
and allowing the person
to have the space to be themselves.

00:14:57.194 --> 00:15:00.547
So I would have thought that perhaps
the most successful relationships

00:15:00.571 --> 00:15:03.851
were ones where there was
a really high negativity threshold.

00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:05.668
Where couples let things go

00:15:05.692 --> 00:15:08.463
and only brought things up
if they really were a big deal.

00:15:08.487 --> 00:15:12.738
But actually, the mathematics
and subsequent findings by the team

00:15:12.762 --> 00:15:15.294
have shown the exact opposite is true.

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:18.108
The best couples,
or the most successful couples,

00:15:18.132 --> 00:15:21.495
are the ones with a really low
negativity threshold.

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:25.153
These are the couples
that don't let anything go unnoticed

00:15:25.177 --> 00:15:28.375
and allow each other
some room to complain.

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:33.633
These are the couples that are continually
trying to repair their own relationship,

00:15:33.657 --> 00:15:36.400
that have a much more positive
outlook on their marriage.

00:15:36.424 --> 00:15:38.492
Couples that don't let things go

00:15:38.516 --> 00:15:43.396
and couples that don't let trivial things
end up being a really big deal.

00:15:44.426 --> 00:15:49.684
Now of course, it takes a bit more
than just a low negativity threshold

00:15:49.708 --> 00:15:54.076
and not compromising
to have a successful relationship.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.626
But I think that it's quite interesting

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.004
to know that there is really
mathematical evidence

00:15:59.028 --> 00:16:02.456
to say that you should never
let the sun go down on your anger.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.164
So those are my top three tips

00:16:04.188 --> 00:16:07.359
of how maths can help you
with love and relationships.

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:09.778
But I hope, that aside from
their use as tips,

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:13.904
they also give you a little bit of insight
into the power of mathematics.

00:16:13.928 --> 00:16:18.269
Because for me, equations
and symbols aren't just a thing.

00:16:18.684 --> 00:16:23.095
They're a voice that speaks out
about the incredible richness of nature

00:16:23.119 --> 00:16:24.905
and the startling simplicity

00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:29.742
in the patterns that twist and turn
and warp and evolve all around us,

00:16:29.766 --> 00:16:32.346
from how the world works to how we behave.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.680
So I hope that perhaps,
for just a couple of you,

00:16:34.704 --> 00:16:37.189
a little bit of insight
into the mathematics of love

00:16:37.213 --> 00:16:40.510
can persuade you to have
a little bit more love for mathematics.

00:16:40.534 --> 00:16:41.733
Thank you.

00:16:41.757 --> 00:16:48.757
(Applause)
