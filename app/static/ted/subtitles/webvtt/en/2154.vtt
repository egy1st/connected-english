00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:05.318
Has anyone among you
ever been exposed to tear gas?

00:00:05.318 --> 00:00:08.433
Tear gas? Anyone?

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:13.004
I'm sorry to hear that, so you might know
that it's a very toxic substance,

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.428
but you might not know
that it's a very simple molecule

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:18.642
with an unpronouncable name:

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:21.762
it's called chlorobenzalmalononitrile.

00:00:21.762 --> 00:00:23.779

I made it.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.137
It's decades old, but it's becoming
very trendy among police forces

00:00:29.137 --> 00:00:32.016
around the planet lately, it seems,

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:36.753
and according to my experience
as a non-voluntary breather of it,

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:41.026
tear gas has two main
but quite opposite effects.

00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:44.168
One, it can really burn your eyes,

00:00:44.168 --> 00:00:47.443
and two, it can also
help you to open them.

00:00:48.603 --> 00:00:52.192
Tear gas definitely helped
to open mine to something

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:55.932
that I want to share
with you this afternoon:

00:00:55.932 --> 00:01:01.226
that livestreaming the power
of independent broadcasts through the web

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:04.407
can be a game-changer in journalism,

00:01:04.407 --> 00:01:10.749
in activism, and as I see it,
in the political discourse as well.

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:15.522
That idea started 
to dawn on me in early 2011

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:19.060
when I was covering
a protest in São Paulo.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.048
It was the marijuana march,

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:25.010
a gathering of people asking
for the legalization of cannabis.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.475
When that group started to move,

00:01:27.475 --> 00:01:31.785
the riot police came from the back
with rubber bullets, bombs,

00:01:31.785 --> 00:01:33.544
and then the gas.

00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:36.202
But to make a long story short,

00:01:36.202 --> 00:01:40.091
I had entered that protest
as the editor-in-chief

00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:44.864
of a well-established printed magazine
where I'd worked for 11 years,

00:01:44.864 --> 00:01:49.776
and thanks to this unsolicited
effects of tear gas,

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:54.709
I left it as a journalist that was now
committed to new ways

00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:00.652
of sharing the raw experience
of what it's like to be there, actually.

00:02:00.652 --> 00:02:04.492
So in the following week,
I was back in the streets,

00:02:04.492 --> 00:02:08.555
but that time, I wasn't a member
of any media outlet anymore.

00:02:08.555 --> 00:02:13.176
I was there as an independent
livestreamer, and all I had with me

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:15.312
was basically borrowed equipment.

00:02:15.312 --> 00:02:21.366
I had a very simple camera
and a backpack with 3G modems.

00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:26.991
And I had this weblink
that could be shared through social media,

00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:29.868
could be put in any website,

00:02:29.868 --> 00:02:32.897
and that time,
the protest went along fine.

00:02:32.897 --> 00:02:34.746
There was no violence.

00:02:34.746 --> 00:02:36.835
There was no action scenes.

00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:39.274
But there was something really exciting,

00:02:39.274 --> 00:02:44.124
because I could see at a distance
the TV channels covering it,

00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:48.148
and they had these big vans
and the teams and the cameras,

00:02:48.148 --> 00:02:50.627
and I was basically doing the same thing

00:02:50.627 --> 00:02:53.403
and all I had was a backpack.

00:02:53.403 --> 00:02:56.678
And that was really
exciting to a journalist,

00:02:56.678 --> 00:03:01.059
but the most interesting part
was when I got back home, actually,

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.886
because I learned that I had been watched

00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:06.990
by more than 90,000 people,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.895
and I got hundreds of emails and messages
of people asking me, basically,

00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:13.295
how did I do it,

00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:16.611
how it was possible to do such a thing.

00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:19.884
And I learned something else,
that that was actually the first time

00:03:19.884 --> 00:03:25.022
that somebody had ever done
a livestreaming in a street protest

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:26.596
in the country.

00:03:27.216 --> 00:03:29.758
And that really shocked me,

00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:33.536
because I was no geek,
I was no technology guy,

00:03:33.536 --> 00:03:36.295
and all the equipment needed
was already there,

00:03:36.295 --> 00:03:38.501
was easily available.

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.617
And I realized that
we had a frontier here,

00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:43.080
a very important one,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.237
that it was just a matter
of changing the perspective,

00:03:46.237 --> 00:03:48.466
and the web could be actually used,

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:51.908
already used, as a colossal
and uncontrollable

00:03:51.908 --> 00:03:55.721
and highly anarchical TV channel,
TV network,

00:03:55.721 --> 00:04:00.905
and anyone with very basic skills
and very basic equipment,

00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:06.748
even someone like me who had this
little stuttering issue,

00:04:06.748 --> 00:04:10.873
so if it happens, bear with me please,

00:04:10.873 --> 00:04:15.392
even someone like me
could become a broadcaster.

00:04:15.392 --> 00:04:17.584
And that sounded revolutionary in my mind.

00:04:17.584 --> 00:04:19.162
So for the next couple of years,

00:04:19.162 --> 00:04:23.209
I started to experiment with
livestreaming in different ways,

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:26.815
not only in the streets
but mostly in studios and in homes,

00:04:26.815 --> 00:04:30.123
until the beginning of 2013, last year,

00:04:30.123 --> 00:04:34.303
when I became the cofounder of a group
called Mídia NINJA.

00:04:34.303 --> 00:04:35.752
NINJA is an acronym

00:04:35.752 --> 00:04:39.582
that stands for Narrativas Independentes 
Jornalismo e Ação,

00:04:39.582 --> 00:04:43.493
or in English, independent narratives,
journalism, and action.

00:04:43.493 --> 00:04:47.415
It was a media group
that had little media plan.

00:04:47.415 --> 00:04:49.464
We didn't have any financial structure.

00:04:49.464 --> 00:04:52.644
We were not planning
to make money out of this,

00:04:52.644 --> 00:04:57.254
which was wise, because you shouldn't
try to make money out of journalism now.

00:04:58.484 --> 00:05:01.188
But we had a very solid
and clear conviction,

00:05:01.188 --> 00:05:06.142
that we knew that the hyperconnected
environment of social media

00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:08.773
could maybe allow us to consolidate

00:05:08.773 --> 00:05:14.117
a network of experimental journalists
throughout the country.

00:05:14.117 --> 00:05:19.254
So we launched a Facebook page first,
and then a manifesto,

00:05:19.254 --> 00:05:22.992
and started to cover the streets
in a very simple way.

00:05:22.992 --> 00:05:27.310
But then something happened,
something that wasn't predicted,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.817
that no one could have anticipated.

00:05:29.817 --> 00:05:32.737
Street protests started
to erupt in São Paulo.

00:05:32.737 --> 00:05:34.917
They began as very local and specific.

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:40.227
They were against the bus fare hike
that had just happened in the city.

00:05:40.227 --> 00:05:42.138
This is a bus.

00:05:42.138 --> 00:05:45.102
It's written there, "Theft."

00:05:45.102 --> 00:05:50.161
But those kind of manifestations
started to grow,

00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:51.996
and they kept happening.

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:56.803
So the police violence against them
started to grow as well.

00:05:56.803 --> 00:05:58.512
But there was another conflict,

00:05:58.512 --> 00:06:01.016
the one I believe that's
more important here

00:06:01.016 --> 00:06:04.976
to make my point that
it was a narrative conflict.

00:06:04.976 --> 00:06:08.006
There was this mainstream media
version of the facts

00:06:08.006 --> 00:06:12.292
that anyone who was on the streets
could easily challenge

00:06:12.292 --> 00:06:18.561
if they presented their own vision
of what was actually happening there.

00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:21.641
And it was this clash of visions,
this clash of narratives,

00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:24.983
that I think turned those protests

00:06:24.983 --> 00:06:28.824
into a long period in the country
of political reckoning

00:06:28.824 --> 00:06:32.332
where hundreds of thousands of people,

00:06:32.332 --> 00:06:34.150
probably more than a million people

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.508
took to the streets in the whole country.

00:06:37.638 --> 00:06:40.252
But it wasn't about
the bus fare hike anymore.

00:06:40.252 --> 00:06:43.796
It was about everything.

00:06:43.796 --> 00:06:46.246
The people's demands, their expectations,

00:06:46.246 --> 00:06:48.396
the reasons why they were on the streets

00:06:48.396 --> 00:06:53.235
could be as diverse as they could
be contradictory in many cases.

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:57.343
If you could read it,
you would understand me.

00:06:57.343 --> 00:07:01.738
But it was in this environment
of political catharsis

00:07:01.738 --> 00:07:04.687
that the country was going through

00:07:04.687 --> 00:07:07.984
that it had to do with politics, indeed,

00:07:07.984 --> 00:07:12.017
but it had to do also
with a new way of organizing,

00:07:12.017 --> 00:07:14.950
through a new way of communicating.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.752
It was in that environment
that Mídia NINJA emerged

00:07:17.752 --> 00:07:22.435
from almost anonymity
to become a national phenomenon,

00:07:22.435 --> 00:07:25.288
because we did have the right equipment.

00:07:25.288 --> 00:07:27.488
We are not using big cameras.

00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:30.112
We are using basically this.

00:07:30.112 --> 00:07:32.111
We are using smartphones.

00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:37.019
And that, actually, allowed us to become
invisible in the middle of the protests,

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:39.701
but it allowed us to do something else:

00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:43.525
to show what it was like
to be in the protests,

00:07:43.525 --> 00:07:49.279
to present to people at home
a subjective perspective.

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:51.615
But there was something
that is more important,

00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:52.971
I think, than the equipment.

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:55.699
It was our mindset,

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:58.870
because we are not behaving
as a media outlet.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.808
We are not competing for news.

00:08:00.808 --> 00:08:03.129
We are trying to encourage people,

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:05.985
to invite people,
and to actually teach people

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:10.195
how to do this, how they also
could become broadcasters.

00:08:10.195 --> 00:08:16.265
And that was crucial to turn Mídia NINJA
from a small group of people,

00:08:16.265 --> 00:08:17.915
and in a matter of weeks,

00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:22.492
we multiplied and we grew
exponentially throughout the country.

00:08:22.492 --> 00:08:27.169
So in a matter of a week or two,
as the protests kept happening,

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:29.381
we were hundreds of young people

00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:32.186
connected in this network
throughout the country.

00:08:32.186 --> 00:08:35.326
We were covering more than
50 cities at the same time.

00:08:35.326 --> 00:08:38.980
That's something that
no TV channel could ever do.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.393
That was responsible
for turning us suddenly, actually,

00:08:42.393 --> 00:08:47.319
into kind of the mainstream
media of social media.

00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:51.370
So we had a couple of thousands
of followers on our Facebook page,

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.606
and soon we had a quarter
of a million followers.

00:08:54.606 --> 00:08:56.290
Our posts and our videos

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:00.269
were being seen by more than
11 million timelines a week.

00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:05.990
It was way more than any newspaper
or any magazine could ever do.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.234
And that turned Mídia NINJA
into something else,

00:09:09.234 --> 00:09:12.675
more than a media outlet,
than a media project.

00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:15.434
It became almost like a public service

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:17.961
to the citizen, to the protester,

00:09:17.961 --> 00:09:19.695
to the activist,

00:09:19.695 --> 00:09:23.123
because they had a very simple
and efficient and peaceful tool

00:09:23.123 --> 00:09:28.014
to confront both police
and media authority.

00:09:29.644 --> 00:09:33.635
Many of our images started 
to be used in regular TV channels.

00:09:33.643 --> 00:09:38.474
Our livestreams started to be broadcast
even in regular televisions

00:09:38.474 --> 00:09:40.423
when things got really rough.

00:09:40.433 --> 00:09:45.730
Some our images were responsible
to take some people out of jail,

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.569
people who were being arrested unfairly

00:09:48.569 --> 00:09:52.338
under false accusations,
and we could prove them innocent.

00:09:52.338 --> 00:09:55.579
And that also turned Mídia NINJA very soon

00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:59.590
to be seen as almost
an enemy of cops, unfortunately,

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:04.663
and we started to be severely beaten,
and eventually arrested on the streets.

00:10:04.663 --> 00:10:06.577
It happened in many cases.

00:10:06.577 --> 00:10:10.909
But that was also useful,
because we were still at the web,

00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:16.094
so that helped to trigger
an important debate in the country

00:10:16.094 --> 00:10:18.543
on the role of the media itself

00:10:18.543 --> 00:10:22.142
and the state of the freedom
of the press in the country.

00:10:22.142 --> 00:10:24.093
So Mídia NINJA now evolved

00:10:24.093 --> 00:10:30.143
and finally consolidated itself
in what we hoped it would become:

00:10:30.143 --> 00:10:33.427
a national network
of hundreds of young people,

00:10:33.427 --> 00:10:37.304
self-organizing themselves locally

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:41.065
to cover social, human rights issues,

00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:43.833
and expressing themselves
not only politically

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:46.735
but journalistically.

00:10:48.665 --> 00:10:53.000
What I started to do
in the beginning of this year,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.156
as Mídia NINJA is already
a self-organizing network,

00:10:57.156 --> 00:11:00.589
I'm dedicating myself to another project.

00:11:00.589 --> 00:11:03.835
It's called Fluxo,
which is Portuguese for "stream."

00:11:03.835 --> 00:11:06.642
It's a journalism studio
in São Paulo downtown,

00:11:06.642 --> 00:11:09.969
where I used livestream to experiment

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:13.474
with what I call post-television formats.

00:11:13.474 --> 00:11:18.852
But I'm also trying to come up with ways
to finance independent journalism

00:11:18.852 --> 00:11:21.664
through a direct relationship
with an audience,

00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:23.626
with an active audience,

00:11:23.626 --> 00:11:26.296
because now I really want
to try to make a living

00:11:26.296 --> 00:11:30.058
out of my tear gas resolution back then.

00:11:30.058 --> 00:11:32.348
But there's something
more significant here,

00:11:32.348 --> 00:11:37.794
something that I believe is more important
and more crucial than my personal example.

00:11:37.794 --> 00:11:42.629
I said that livestream could turn the web
into a colossal TV network,

00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:44.666
but I believe it does something else,

00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:47.627
because after watching people using it,

00:11:47.627 --> 00:11:53.651
not only to cover things but to express,
to organize themselves politically,

00:11:53.651 --> 00:12:00.405
I believe livestream can turn cyberspace
into a global political arena

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.803
where everyone might have a voice,

00:12:02.803 --> 00:12:04.347
a proper voice,

00:12:04.347 --> 00:12:09.832
because livestream takes the monopoly
of the broadcast political discourse,

00:12:09.832 --> 00:12:12.585
of the verbal aspect
of the political dialogue

00:12:12.585 --> 00:12:18.194
out of the mouths of just politicians
and political pundits alone,

00:12:18.194 --> 00:12:23.664
and it empowers the citizen
through this direct and non-mediated power

00:12:23.664 --> 00:12:26.647
of exchanging experiences and dialogue,

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:30.697
empowers them to question
and to influence authorities

00:12:30.697 --> 00:12:34.226
in ways in which we are about to see.

00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:38.780
And I believe it does something else
that might be even more important,

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:45.470
that the simplicity of the technology
can merge objectivity and subjectivity

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.133
in a very political way, as I see it,

00:12:48.133 --> 00:12:53.302
because it really helps the audience,

00:12:53.302 --> 00:12:57.796
the citizen, to see the world
through somebody else's eye,

00:12:57.796 --> 00:13:01.230
so it helps the citizen
to put him- or herself

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.902
in other people's place.

00:13:03.902 --> 00:13:07.170
And that idea, I think, 
should be the intention,

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.885
should be the goal of any good journalism,
any good activism,

00:13:11.885 --> 00:13:14.537
but most of all, any good politics.

00:13:14.537 --> 00:13:17.065
Thank you very much. It was an honor.

00:13:17.065 --> 00:13:22.708
(Applause)
