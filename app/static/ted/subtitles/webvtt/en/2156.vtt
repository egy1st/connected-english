00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:03.150
The power of yet.

00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:06.523
I heard about a high school in Chicago

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:10.699
where students had to pass
a certain number of courses to graduate,

00:00:10.723 --> 00:00:16.222
and if they didn't pass a course,
they got the grade "Not Yet."

00:00:16.246 --> 00:00:18.675
And I thought that was fantastic,

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.460
because if you get a failing grade,
you think, I'm nothing, I'm nowhere.

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:25.384
But if you get the grade "Not Yet",

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:28.903
you understand that
you're on a learning curve.

00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:32.313
It gives you a path into the future.

00:00:32.337 --> 00:00:36.101
"Not Yet" also gave me insight

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.401
into a critical event early in my career,

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:42.104
a real turning point.

00:00:42.598 --> 00:00:44.069
I wanted to see

00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:49.530
how children coped
with challenge and difficulty,

00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:52.722
so I gave 10-year-olds

00:00:52.746 --> 00:00:56.275
problems that were
slightly too hard for them.

00:00:57.085 --> 00:01:02.084
Some of them reacted
in a shockingly positive way.

00:01:02.108 --> 00:01:06.108
They said things like,
"I love a challenge,"

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:11.126
or, "You know, I was hoping
this would be informative."

00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:17.686
They understood that their abilities
could be developed.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.025
They had what I call a growth mindset.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:26.954
But other students felt
it was tragic, catastrophic.

00:01:26.978 --> 00:01:31.255
From their more fixed mindset perspective,

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:35.201
their intelligence
had been up for judgment,

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:36.956
and they failed.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.295
Instead of luxuriating
in the power of yet,

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.365
they were gripped in the tyranny of now.

00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:49.650
So what do they do next?

00:01:49.674 --> 00:01:52.080
I'll tell you what they do next.

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:58.317
In one study, they told us
they would probably cheat the next time

00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:02.253
instead of studying more
if they failed a test.

00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:05.660
In another study, after a failure,

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:08.799
they looked for someone
who did worse than they did

00:02:08.823 --> 00:02:12.271
so they could feel really
good about themselves.

00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:18.604
And in study after study,
they have run from difficulty.

00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:25.081
Scientists measured
the electrical activity from the brain

00:02:25.105 --> 00:02:28.227
as students confronted an error.

00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:32.287
On the left, you see
the fixed-mindset students.

00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:34.744
There's hardly any activity.

00:02:34.768 --> 00:02:37.045
They run from the error.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.670
They don't engage with it.

00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:43.341
But on the right, you have the students
with the growth mindset,

00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:47.284
the idea that abilities can be developed.

00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:49.229
They engage deeply.

00:02:49.253 --> 00:02:52.310
Their brain is on fire with yet.

00:02:52.334 --> 00:02:53.962
They engage deeply.

00:02:54.652 --> 00:02:56.655
They process the error.

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:01.235
They learn from it and they correct it.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.576
How are we raising our children?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.337
Are we raising them
for now instead of yet?

00:03:09.783 --> 00:03:14.897
Are we raising kids
who are obsessed with getting As?

00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:19.341
Are we raising kids who don't know
how to dream big dreams?

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:26.779
Their biggest goal is getting the next A,
or the next test score?

00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:33.949
And are they carrying this need
for constant validation with them

00:03:33.973 --> 00:03:36.116
into their future lives?

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.247
Maybe, because employers
are coming to me and saying,

00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:43.743
"We have already raised a generation

00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:47.849
of young workers
who can't get through the day

00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:50.438
without an award."

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:53.445
So what can we do?

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.253
How can we build that bridge to yet?

00:03:57.277 --> 00:03:59.368
Here are some things we can do.

00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:03.367
First of all, we can praise wisely,

00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:06.599
not praising intelligence or talent.

00:04:06.623 --> 00:04:08.433
That has failed.

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.095
Don't do that anymore.

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:14.623
But praising the process
that kids engage in,

00:04:14.647 --> 00:04:18.904
their effort, their strategies,
their focus, their perseverance,

00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:20.577
their improvement.

00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:26.629
This process praise creates kids
who are hardy and resilient.

00:04:27.344 --> 00:04:30.106
There are other ways to reward yet.

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:34.777
We recently teamed up with game scientists

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:36.921
from the University of Washington

00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:42.053
to create a new online math game
that rewarded yet.

00:04:42.077 --> 00:04:48.289
In this game, students were rewarded
for effort, strategy and progress.

00:04:48.313 --> 00:04:50.845
The usual math game

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:55.275
rewards you for getting answers
right, right now,

00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:58.369
but this game rewarded process.

00:04:58.393 --> 00:05:01.160
And we got more effort,

00:05:01.184 --> 00:05:03.355
more strategies,

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.273
more engagement
over longer periods of time,

00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:12.791
and more perseverance when they hit
really, really hard problems.

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:17.083
Just the words "yet"
or "not yet," we're finding,

00:05:17.107 --> 00:05:20.551
give kids greater confidence,

00:05:20.575 --> 00:05:26.952
give them a path into the future
that creates greater persistence.

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:32.069
And we can actually
change students' mindsets.

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:35.212
In one study, we taught them

00:05:35.236 --> 00:05:39.693
that every time they push out
of their comfort zone

00:05:39.717 --> 00:05:43.139
to learn something new and difficult,

00:05:43.163 --> 00:05:48.815
the neurons in their brain
can form new, stronger connections,

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.264
and over time, they can get smarter.

00:05:52.288 --> 00:05:54.791
Look what happened: In this study,

00:05:54.815 --> 00:05:58.568
students who were not taught
this growth mindset

00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:04.318
continued to show declining grades
over this difficult school transition,

00:06:04.342 --> 00:06:10.768
but those who were taught this lesson
showed a sharp rebound in their grades.

00:06:11.318 --> 00:06:17.241
We have shown this now,
this kind of improvement,

00:06:17.265 --> 00:06:23.492
with thousands and thousands of kids,
especially struggling students.

00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:27.541
So let's talk about equality.

00:06:28.291 --> 00:06:32.529
In our country,
there are groups of students

00:06:32.553 --> 00:06:35.348
who chronically underperform,

00:06:35.372 --> 00:06:38.520
for example, children in inner cities,

00:06:38.544 --> 00:06:42.003
or children on Native American
reservations.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:45.764
And they've done so poorly for so long

00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:48.871
that many people think it's inevitable.

00:06:49.404 --> 00:06:55.295
But when educators create
growth mindset classrooms

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.690
steeped in yet,

00:06:57.714 --> 00:07:00.834
equality happens.

00:07:00.858 --> 00:07:05.003
And here are just a few examples.

00:07:05.027 --> 00:07:10.914
In one year, a kindergarten class
in Harlem, New York

00:07:10.938 --> 00:07:15.437
scored in the 95th percentile

00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:18.610
on the national achievement test.

00:07:18.634 --> 00:07:22.996
Many of those kids could not hold a pencil

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.752
when they arrived at school.

00:07:25.776 --> 00:07:28.482
In one year,

00:07:28.588 --> 00:07:33.424
fourth-grade students
in the South Bronx, way behind,

00:07:33.448 --> 00:07:39.710
became the number one fourth-grade class
in the state of New York

00:07:39.734 --> 00:07:42.099
on the state math test.

00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:47.403
In a year, to a year and a half,

00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:52.777
Native American students
in a school on a reservation

00:07:52.801 --> 00:07:58.702
went from the bottom
of their district to the top,

00:07:59.824 --> 00:08:05.169
and that district included
affluent sections of Seattle.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:11.878
So the Native kids
outdid the Microsoft kids.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:20.125
This happened because the meaning
of effort and difficulty were transformed.

00:08:20.921 --> 00:08:24.616
Before, effort and difficulty

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.817
made them feel dumb,
made them feel like giving up,

00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:33.599
but now, effort and difficulty,

00:08:33.623 --> 00:08:37.135
that's when their neurons
are making new connections,

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.944
stronger connections.

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:42.104
That's when they're getting smarter.

00:08:42.796 --> 00:08:48.166
I received a letter recently
from a 13-year-old boy.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.185
He said, "Dear Professor Dweck,

00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:59.158
I appreciate that your writing
is based on solid scientific research,

00:08:59.182 --> 00:09:04.164
and that's why I decided
to put it into practice.

00:09:04.188 --> 00:09:08.075
I put more effort into my schoolwork,

00:09:08.099 --> 00:09:11.030
into my relationship with my family,

00:09:11.054 --> 00:09:15.278
and into my relationship
with kids at school,

00:09:15.302 --> 00:09:21.748
and I experienced great improvement
in all of those areas.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.435
I now realize I've wasted
most of my life."

00:09:29.357 --> 00:09:34.348
Let's not waste any more lives,

00:09:35.096 --> 00:09:38.874
because once we know

00:09:38.898 --> 00:09:44.280
that abilities are capable of such growth,

00:09:44.304 --> 00:09:51.244
it becomes a basic human right
for children, all children,

00:09:51.268 --> 00:09:56.909
to live in places that create that growth,

00:09:56.933 --> 00:10:02.300
to live in places filled with "yet".

00:10:02.987 --> 00:10:04.138
Thank you.

00:10:04.162 --> 00:10:07.460
(Applause)
