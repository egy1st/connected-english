00:00:01.457 --> 00:00:04.454
Our world has many superheroes.

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:10.012
But they have the worst of
all superpowers: invisibility.

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:12.349
For example, the catadores,

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.462
workers who collect recyclable 
materials for a living.

00:00:16.462 --> 00:00:21.122
Catadores emerged from 
social inequality, unemployment,

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:24.141
and the abundance of solid waste

00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:28.740
from the deficiency of the 
waste collection system.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.500
Catadores provide a heavy, 
honest and essential work

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.441
that benefits the entire population.
But they are not acknowledged for it.

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:46.128
Here in Brazil, they collect 90 percent
of all the waste that's actually recycled.

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:50.164
Most of the catadores work independently,

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:55.575
picking waste from the streets and 
selling to junk yards at very low prices.

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:58.970
They may collect over 300 kilos

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.825
in their bags, shopping carts, 
bicycles and carroças.

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:07.351
Carroças are carts
built from wood or metal

00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:10.169
and found in several streets in Brazil,

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:12.792
much like graffiti and street art.

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:17.743
And this is how I first met these 
marginalized superheroes.

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:20.023
I am a graffiti artist and activist

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:26.208
and my art is social, environmental 
and political in nature.

00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:31.370
In 2007, I took my work beyond walls
and onto the carroças,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.324
as a new urban support for my message.

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:38.141
But at this time, 
giving voice to the catadores.

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:43.482
By adding art and humor to the cause,
it became more appealing,

00:01:43.482 --> 00:01:46.050
which helped call attention 
to the catadores

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.975
and improve their self-esteem.

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:53.256
And also, they are famous now 
on the streets, on mass media and social.

00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:55.945
So, the thing is,

00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:59.902
I plunged into this universe 
and have not stopped working since.

00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:03.336
I have painted over 200 
carroças in many cities

00:02:03.336 --> 00:02:07.301
and have been invited to do exhibitions 
and trips worldwide.

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:11.953
And then I realized that catadores,
in their invisibility,

00:02:11.953 --> 00:02:13.981
are not exclusive to Brazil.

00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:18.505
I met them in Argentina, Chile,

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:23.079
Bolivia, South Africa, Turkey

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.104
and even in developed countries such
as the United States and Japan.

00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:32.820
And this was when I realized that I needed
to have more people join the cause

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.653
because it's a big challenge.

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:40.455
And then, I created a collaborative 
movement called Pimp My Carroça --

00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:44.142
(Laughter) -- which is 
a large crowdfunded event.

00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:45.169
Thank you.

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.978
(Applause).

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:52.840
So Pimp My Carroça is a large 
crowdfunded event

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.576
to help catadores and their carroças.

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:59.635
Catadores are assisted by well-being 
professionals and healthcare,

00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:06.393
like physicians, dentists, podiatrists, 
hair stylists, massage therapists

00:03:06.393 --> 00:03:07.698
and much more.

00:03:07.698 --> 00:03:12.667
But also, they also receive safety shirts,
gloves, raincoats and eyeglasses

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.762
to see in high-definition the city,

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:19.780
while their carroças are renovated
by our incredible volunteers.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.189
And then they receive safety items, too:

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.554
reflective tapes, horns and mirrors.

00:03:24.554 --> 00:03:27.119
Then, finally, painted by a street artist

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:31.470
and become part of part of this huge, 
amazing mobile art exhibition.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.208
Pimp My Carroça took to the streets
of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba.

00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:42.907
But to meet the demand in other cities,
including outside of Brazil,

00:03:42.907 --> 00:03:48.092
we have created Pimpx,
which is inspired by TEDx,

00:03:48.092 --> 00:03:54.026
and it's a simplified, do-it-yourself,
crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça.

00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:57.016
So now everybody can join.

00:03:57.016 --> 00:04:05.150
In two years, over 170 catadores,
800 volunteers and 200 street artists

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.126
and more than 1,000 donors

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:10.001
have been involved in the 
Pimp My Carroça movement,

00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:14.575
whose actions have even been used
in teaching recycling at a local school.

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:20.108
So catadores are leaving 
invisibility behind

00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:23.662
and becoming increasingly
respected and valued.

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:28.219
Because of their pimped carroças,
they are able to fight back to prejudice,

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:32.109
increase their income and 
their interaction with society.

00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:37.043
So now, I'd like to challenge you 
to start looking at and acknowledging

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:41.065
the catadores and other 
invisible superheroes from your city.

00:04:41.065 --> 00:04:46.134
Try to see the world as one, 
without boundaries or frontiers.

00:04:46.134 --> 00:04:47.764
Believe it or not,

00:04:47.764 --> 00:04:53.785
there are over 20 million 
catadores worldwide.

00:04:53.785 --> 00:04:56.405
So next time you see one,

00:04:56.405 --> 00:05:01.066
recognize them as a vital part
of our society.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:03.710
Muito obrigado, thank you.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.468
(Applause).
