00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.928
I'm a lexicographer.

00:00:01.928 --> 00:00:03.682
I make dictionaries.

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:05.121
And my job as a lexicographer

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:08.841
is to try to put all the words possible 
into the dictionary.

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:14.924
My job is not to decide what a word is;
that is your job.

00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:17.821
Everybody who speaks English 
decides together

00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:20.153
what's a word and what's not a word.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:25.305
Every language is just a group of people
who agree to understand each other.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:29.909
Now, sometimes when people are trying 
to decide whether a word is good or bad,

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.677
they don't really have a good reason.

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:34.488
So they say something like,
"Because grammar!"

00:00:34.488 --> 00:00:36.422
(Laughter)

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:40.425
I don't actually really care about grammar
too much -- don't tell anybody.

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:43.564
But the word "grammar," actually,
there are two kinds of grammar.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:46.434
There's the kind of grammar
that lives inside your brain,

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:48.543
and if you're a native 
speaker of a language

00:00:48.543 --> 00:00:50.132
or a good speaker of a language,

00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:53.531
it's the unconscious rules that you follow
when you speak that language.

00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:56.552
And this is what you learn when
you learn a language as a child.

00:00:56.552 --> 00:00:58.189
And here's an example:

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:59.714
This is a wug, right?

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:01.775
It's a wug.

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:03.471
Now there is another one.

00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:04.634
There are two of these.

00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:05.923
There are two ...

00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:07.107
Audience: Wugs.

00:01:07.107 --> 00:01:10.820
Erin McKean: Exactly! You know 
how to make the plural of wug.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.301
That rule lives in your brain.

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:15.250
You never had to be taught this rule, 
you just understand it.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.879
This is an experiment that was invented
by a professor at [Boston University]

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:22.024
named Jean Berko Gleason back in 1958.

00:01:22.024 --> 00:01:25.049
So we've been talking about this 
for a long time.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.563
Now, these kinds of natural rules 
that exist in your brain,

00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:32.785
they're not like traffic laws,
they're more like laws of nature.

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:36.140
And nobody has to remind you to obey 
a law of nature, right?

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.093
When you leave the house in the morning, 
your mom doesn't say,

00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:41.972
"Hey, honey, I think
it's going to be cold, take a hoodie,

00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:44.439
don't forget to obey the law of gravity."

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.325
Nobody says this.

00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:53.182
Now, there are other rules that are more
about manners than they are about nature.

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:56.046
So you can think of a word as like a hat.

00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:58.296
Once you know how hats work,

00:01:58.296 --> 00:02:01.163
nobody has to tell you, 
"Don't wear hats on your feet."

00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:04.507
What they have to tell you is, 
"Can you wear hats inside?


00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:06.264
Who gets to wear a hat?

00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:09.396
What are the kinds of hats
you get to wear?"

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.818
Those are more of the second kind 
of grammar,


00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:16.121
which linguists often call usage, 
as opposed to grammar.

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:20.255
Now, sometimes people use this kind of 
rules-based grammar

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:23.043
to discourage people from making up words.

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:25.727
And I think that is, well, stupid.

00:02:25.727 --> 00:02:28.993
So, for example, 
people are always telling you,

00:02:28.993 --> 00:02:34.233
"Be creative, make new music, do art, 
invent things, science and technology."

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:36.271
But when it comes to 
words, they're like,

00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:40.991
"Don't! No. Creativity stops right here,
whippersnappers. Give it a rest."

00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:42.421
(Laughter)

00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:44.142
But that makes no sense to me.

00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:46.474
Words are great.
We should have more of them.

00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:50.530
I want you to make
as many new words as possible.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.538
And I'm going to tell you six ways that
you can use to make new words in English.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.639
The first way is the simplest way.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.862
Basically, steal them from other 
languages.

00:02:59.862 --> 00:03:02.686
["Go rob other people"]
(Laughter)

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:05.764
Linguists call this borrowing,

00:03:05.764 --> 00:03:08.824
but we never give the words back ,
so I'm just going to be honest

00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:10.784
and call it stealing.

00:03:10.784 --> 00:03:14.154
We usually take words for things 
that we like, like delicious food.

00:03:14.154 --> 00:03:17.944
We took "kumquat" from Chinese,
we took "caramel" from French.

00:03:17.944 --> 00:03:20.851
We also take words 
for cool things like "ninja," right?

00:03:20.851 --> 00:03:22.301
We took that from Japanese,

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.570
which is kind of a cool trick because 
ninjas are hard to steal from.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.684
(Laughter)

00:03:27.684 --> 00:03:30.944
So another way that you 
can make words in English

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:33.885
is by squishing two 
other English words together.

00:03:33.885 --> 00:03:35.572
This is called compounding.

00:03:35.572 --> 00:03:37.082
Words in English are like Lego:

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:40.447
If you use enough force, 
you can put any two of them together.

00:03:40.447 --> 00:03:42.112
(Laughter)

00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:44.627
We do this all the time in English:

00:03:44.627 --> 00:03:50.105
Words like "heartbroken," "bookworm," 
"sandcastle" all are compounds.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:53.606
So go ahead and make words like
"duckface," just don't make duckface.

00:03:53.606 --> 00:03:55.085
(Laughter)

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:59.848
Another way that you can make words 
in English is kind of like compounding,

00:03:59.848 --> 00:04:04.899
but instead you use so much force
when you squish the words together

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:06.534
that some parts fall off.

00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:08.215
So these are blend words, 


00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:12.064
like "brunch" is a blend 
of "breakfast" and "lunch."

00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:14.796
"Motel" is a blend of "motor" and "hotel."

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:17.737
Who here knew that "motel" 
was a blend word?

00:04:17.737 --> 00:04:19.581
Yeah, that word is so old in English

00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:22.692
that lots of people don't know that 
there are parts missing.

00:04:22.692 --> 00:04:26.987
"Edutainment" is a blend 
of "education" and "entertainment."

00:04:26.987 --> 00:04:32.197
And of course, "electrocute" is a
blend of "electric" and "execute."

00:04:32.197 --> 00:04:34.007
(Laughter)

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:37.328
You can also make words
by changing how they operate.

00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:38.941
This is called functional shift.

00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:41.242
You take a word that acts 
as one part of speech,

00:04:41.242 --> 00:04:43.522
and you change it into another 
part of speech.

00:04:43.522 --> 00:04:47.541
Okay, who here knew that "friend"
hasn't always been a verb?

00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:53.076
"Friend" used to be noun 
and then we verbed it.

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:56.345
Almost any word in English can be verbed.

00:04:56.345 --> 00:04:58.978
You can also take adjectives 
and make them into nouns.

00:04:58.978 --> 00:05:02.705
"Commercial" used to be an adjective 
and now it's a noun.

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:05.151
And of course, you can "green" things.

00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:08.489
Another way to make words
in English is back-formation.

00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:11.747
You can take a word and you can
kind of squish it down a little bit.

00:05:11.747 --> 00:05:16.568
So for example, in English we had the word
"editor" before we had the word "edit."

00:05:16.568 --> 00:05:18.320
"Edit" was formed from "editor."

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.065
Sometimes these back-formations 
sound a little silly:

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:25.453
Bulldozers bulldoze, butlers butle 
and burglers burgle.

00:05:25.453 --> 00:05:27.078
(Laughter)

00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:29.050
Another way to make words in English

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.220
is to take the first letters of something
and squish them together.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.251
So National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration becomes NASA.

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:38.963
And of course you can do this 
with anything, OMG!

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:44.602
So it doesn't matter how silly 
the words are.

00:05:44.602 --> 00:05:46.608
They can be really good words of English.

00:05:46.608 --> 00:05:50.626
"Absquatulate" is a perfectly 
good word of English.

00:05:50.626 --> 00:05:53.489
"Mugwump" is a perfectly 
good word of English.

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:58.067
So the words don't have have to sound 
normal, they can sound really silly.

00:05:58.067 --> 00:06:00.256
Why should you make words?

00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:02.397
You should make words because every word

00:06:02.397 --> 00:06:06.918
is a chance to express your idea and get 
your meaning across.

00:06:06.918 --> 00:06:09.514
And new words grab people's attention.

00:06:09.514 --> 00:06:12.163
They get people to focus on what 
you're saying

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:15.427
and that gives you a better chance to get 
your meaning across.

00:06:15.427 --> 00:06:18.376
A lot of people 
on this stage today have said,

00:06:18.376 --> 00:06:19.938
"In the future, you can do this,

00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:23.471
you can help with this, you can 
help us explore, you can help us invent."

00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:25.100
You can make a new word right now.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.433
English has no age limit.

00:06:27.433 --> 00:06:29.859
Go ahead, start making words today,

00:06:29.859 --> 00:06:33.546
send them to me, and I will put them 
in my online dictionary, Wordnik.

00:06:33.546 --> 00:06:34.835
Thank you so much.

00:06:34.835 --> 00:06:39.642
(Applause)
