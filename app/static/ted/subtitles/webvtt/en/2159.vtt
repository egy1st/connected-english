00:00:01.114 --> 00:00:08.606
So over the past few centuries,
microscopes have revolutionized our world.

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:14.252
They revealed to us a tiny world
of objects, life and structures

00:00:14.252 --> 00:00:17.158
that are too small for us
to see with our naked eyes.

00:00:17.158 --> 00:00:20.177
They are a tremendous contribution
to science and technology.

00:00:20.177 --> 00:00:23.404
Today I'd like to introduce you
to a new type of microscope,

00:00:23.404 --> 00:00:25.982
a microscope for changes.

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:28.884
It doesn't use optics
like a regular microscope

00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:30.881
to make small objects bigger,

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:35.257
but instead it uses a video camera
and image processing

00:00:35.257 --> 00:00:40.513
to reveal to us the tiniest motions
and color changes in objects and people,

00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:44.355
changes that are impossible
for us to see with our naked eyes.

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:48.475
And it lets us look at our world
in a completely new way.

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:50.385
So what do I mean by color changes?

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:53.217
Our skin, for example,
changes its color very slightly

00:00:53.217 --> 00:00:55.214
when the blood flows under it.

00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:57.611
That change is incredibly subtle,

00:00:57.611 --> 00:00:59.674
which is why, when you
look at other people,

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.925
when you look at the person
sitting next to you,

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:05.500
you don't see their skin
or their face changing color.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.860
When we look at this video of Steve here,
it appears to us like a static picture,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.720
but once we look at this video
through our new, special microscope,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.320
suddenly we see
a completely different image.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.250
What you see here are small changes
in the color of Steve's skin,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.686
magnified 100 times
so that they become visible.

00:01:24.686 --> 00:01:27.953
We can actually see a human pulse.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:31.180
We can see how fast
Steve's heart is beating,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.535
but we can also see the actual way
that the blood flows in his face.

00:01:36.544 --> 00:01:39.175
And we can do that not just
to visualize the pulse,

00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:42.646
but also to actually 
recover our heart rates,

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:44.439
and measure our heart rates.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.892
And we can do it with regular cameras
and without touching the patients.

00:01:48.892 --> 00:01:54.509
So here you see the pulse and heart rate
we extracted from a neonatal baby

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.390
from a video we took
with a regular DSLR camera,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.206
and the heart rate measurement we get

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:04.017
is as accurate as the one you'd get
with a standard monitor in a hospital.

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:06.659
And it doesn't even have to be
a video we recorded.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.654
We can do it essentially
with other videos as well.

00:02:09.654 --> 00:02:13.555
So I just took a short clip
from "Batman Begins" here

00:02:13.555 --> 00:02:15.459
just to show Christian Bale's pulse.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.281
(Laughter)

00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:19.404
And you know, presumably
he's wearing makeup,

00:02:19.404 --> 00:02:21.357
the lighting here is kind of challenging,

00:02:21.357 --> 00:02:24.308
but still, just from the video,
we're able to extract his pulse

00:02:24.308 --> 00:02:26.326
and show it quite well.

00:02:26.326 --> 00:02:28.246
So how do we do all that?

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:32.844
We basically analyze the changes
in the light that are recorded

00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:35.115
at every pixel in the video over time,

00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:36.913
and then we crank up those changes.

00:02:36.913 --> 00:02:39.075
We make them bigger
so that we can see them.

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:40.977
The tricky part is that those signals,

00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:43.910
those changes that we're after,
are extremely subtle,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.689
so we have to be very careful
when you try to separate them

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.520
from noise that always exists in videos.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.515
So we use some clever
image processing techniques

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:57.509
to get a very accurate measurement
of the color at each pixel in the video,

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:00.179
and then the way the color
changes over time,

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.872
and then we amplify those changes.

00:03:02.872 --> 00:03:06.852
We make them bigger to create those types
of enhanced videos, or magnified videos,

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:09.024
that actually show us those changes.

00:03:09.024 --> 00:03:13.262
But it turns out we can do that
not just to show tiny changes in color,

00:03:13.262 --> 00:03:15.503
but also tiny motions,

00:03:15.503 --> 00:03:19.079
and that's because the light
that gets recorded in our cameras

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.889
will change not only if the color
of the object changes,

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.257
but also if the object moves.

00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:27.893
So this is my daughter
when she was about two months old.

00:03:27.893 --> 00:03:30.892
It's a video I recorded
about three years ago.

00:03:30.892 --> 00:03:34.100
And as new parents, we all want
to make sure our babies are healthy,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.642
that they're breathing,
that they're alive, of course.

00:03:36.642 --> 00:03:38.784
So I too got one of those baby monitors

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:41.253
so that I could see my daughter
when she was asleep.

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:44.780
And this is pretty much what you'll see
with a standard baby monitor.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.462
You can see the baby's sleeping, but 
there's not too much information there.

00:03:48.474 --> 00:03:50.078
There's not too much we can see.

00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:52.902
Wouldn't it be better,
or more informative, or more useful,

00:03:52.902 --> 00:03:55.892
if instead we could look
at the view like this.

00:03:55.892 --> 00:04:02.248
So here I took the motions
and I magnified them 30 times,

00:04:02.248 --> 00:04:06.074
and then I could clearly see that my
daughter was indeed alive and breathing.

00:04:06.074 --> 00:04:08.327
(Laughter)

00:04:08.327 --> 00:04:10.249
Here is a side-by-side comparison.

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.732
So again, in the source video,
in the original video,

00:04:12.732 --> 00:04:14.368
there's not too much we can see,

00:04:14.368 --> 00:04:18.075
but once we magnify the motions,
the breathing becomes much more visible.

00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:20.145
And it turns out, there's
a lot of phenomena

00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:23.768
we can reveal and magnify
with our new motion microscope.

00:04:23.768 --> 00:04:28.332
We can see how our veins and arteries
are pulsing in our bodies.

00:04:28.332 --> 00:04:30.960
We can see that our eyes
are constantly moving

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.847
in this wobbly motion.

00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:34.356
And that's actually my eye,

00:04:34.356 --> 00:04:37.421
and again this video was taken
right after my daughter was born,

00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:41.623
so you can see I wasn't getting
too much sleep. (Laughter)

00:04:41.623 --> 00:04:44.339
Even when a person is sitting still,

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:46.383
there's a lot of information
we can extract

00:04:46.383 --> 00:04:49.912
about their breathing patterns,
small facial expressions.

00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:51.537
Maybe we could use those motions

00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:54.691
to tell us something about
our thoughts or our emotions.

00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:57.946
We can also magnify small
mechanical movements,

00:04:57.946 --> 00:04:59.501
like vibrations in engines,

00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:03.193
that can help engineers detect
and diagnose machinery problems,

00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:07.931
or see how our buildings and structures
sway in the wind and react to forces.

00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:12.512
Those are all things that our society
knows how to measure in various ways,

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:14.965
but measuring those motions is one thing,

00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:17.241
and actually seeing those
motions as they happen

00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:19.795
is a whole different thing.

00:05:19.795 --> 00:05:22.836
And ever since we discovered
this new technology,

00:05:22.836 --> 00:05:26.789
we made our code available online so that 
others could use and experiment with it.

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.664
It's very simple to use.

00:05:28.664 --> 00:05:30.708
It can work on your own videos.

00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:33.901
Our collaborators at Quanta Research
even created this nice website

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:36.579
where you can upload your videos
and process them online,

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:40.395
so even if you don't have any experience
in computer science or programming,

00:05:40.395 --> 00:05:43.331
you can still very easily experiment
with this new microscope.

00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:45.735
And I'd like to show you
just a couple of examples

00:05:45.735 --> 00:05:48.470
of what others have done with it.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.787
So this video was made by
a YouTube user called Tamez85.

00:05:53.787 --> 00:05:55.250
I don't know who that user is,

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.595
but he, or she, used our code

00:05:57.595 --> 00:06:01.310
to magnify small belly
movements during pregnancy.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.912
It's kind of creepy.

00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:04.525
(Laughter)

00:06:04.525 --> 00:06:09.486
People have used it to magnify
pulsing veins in their hands.

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:13.268
And you know it's not real science
unless you use guinea pigs,

00:06:13.268 --> 00:06:16.658
and apparently this guinea pig
is called Tiffany,

00:06:16.658 --> 00:06:19.607
and this YouTube user claims
it is the first rodent on Earth

00:06:19.607 --> 00:06:22.295
that was motion-magnified.

00:06:22.295 --> 00:06:24.483
You can also do some art with it.

00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:27.501
So this video was sent to me
by a design student at Yale.

00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:29.638
She wanted to see
if there's any difference

00:06:29.638 --> 00:06:31.160
in the way her classmates move.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.369
She made them all stand still,
and then magnified their motions.

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:38.747
It's like seeing 
still pictures come to life.

00:06:38.747 --> 00:06:41.180
And the nice thing with 
all those examples

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.476
is that we had nothing to do with them.

00:06:43.476 --> 00:06:47.330
We just provided this new tool,
a new way to look at the world,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.462
and then people find other interesting,
new and creative ways of using it.

00:06:52.462 --> 00:06:54.226
But we didn't stop there.

00:06:54.226 --> 00:06:57.477
This tool not only allows us
to look at the world in a new way,

00:06:57.477 --> 00:06:59.845
it also redefines what we can do

00:06:59.845 --> 00:07:03.026
and pushes the limits of what
we can do with our cameras.

00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:05.255
So as scientists, we started wondering,

00:07:05.255 --> 00:07:09.040
what other types of physical phenomena
produce tiny motions

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.943
that we could now use
our cameras to measure?

00:07:11.943 --> 00:07:15.944
And one such phenomenon
that we focused on recently is sound.

00:07:15.944 --> 00:07:18.049
Sound, as we all know,
is basically changes

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:20.232
in air pressure that
travel through the air.

00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:23.853
Those pressure waves hit objects
and they create small vibrations in them,

00:07:23.853 --> 00:07:26.385
which is how we hear
and how we record sound.

00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:30.053
But it turns out that sound
also produces visual motions.

00:07:30.053 --> 00:07:32.886
Those are motions
that are not visible to us

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:35.887
but are visible to a camera
with the right processing.

00:07:35.887 --> 00:07:37.460
So here are two examples.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.074
This is me demonstrating
my great singing skills.

00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:42.698
(Singing)

00:07:42.698 --> 00:07:44.134
(Laughter)

00:07:44.134 --> 00:07:47.120
And I took a high-speed video
of my throat while I was humming.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.884
Again, if you stare at that video,

00:07:48.884 --> 00:07:50.960
there's not too much
you'll be able to see,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.292
but once we magnify the motions 100 times,
we can see all the motions and ripples

00:07:55.292 --> 00:07:58.566
in the neck that are involved
in producing the sound.

00:07:58.566 --> 00:08:01.306
That signal is there in that video.

00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:03.976
We also know that singers
can break a wine glass

00:08:03.976 --> 00:08:05.439
if they hit the correct note.

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:07.204
So here, we're going to play a note

00:08:07.204 --> 00:08:09.730
that's in the resonance
frequency of that glass

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.778
through a loudspeaker that's next to it.

00:08:11.778 --> 00:08:16.197
Once we play that note
and magnify the motions 250 times,

00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:18.535
we can very clearly see 
how the glass vibrates

00:08:18.535 --> 00:08:22.105
and resonates in response to the sound.

00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:24.525
It's not something you're used
to seeing every day.

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:28.054
But this made us think.
It gave us this crazy idea.

00:08:28.054 --> 00:08:33.662
Can we actually invert this process
and recover sound from video

00:08:33.662 --> 00:08:37.697
by analyzing the tiny vibrations
that sound waves create in objects,

00:08:37.697 --> 00:08:42.474
and essentially convert those
back into the sounds that produced them.

00:08:42.474 --> 00:08:46.931
In this way, we can turn
everyday objects into microphones.

00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:49.163
So that's exactly what we did.

00:08:49.163 --> 00:08:51.979
So here's an empty bag of chips
that was lying on a table,

00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:54.804
and we're going to turn that 
bag of chips into a microphone

00:08:54.804 --> 00:08:56.395
by filming it with a video camera

00:08:56.395 --> 00:08:59.623
and analyzing the tiny motions
that sound waves create in it.

00:08:59.623 --> 00:09:02.419
So here's the sound
that we played in the room.

00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:06.853
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:13.032
And this is a high-speed video
we recorded of that bag of chips.

00:09:13.032 --> 00:09:14.306
Again it's playing.

00:09:14.306 --> 00:09:17.648
There's no chance you'll be able
to see anything going on in that video

00:09:17.648 --> 00:09:18.706
just by looking at it,

00:09:18.706 --> 00:09:21.690
but here's the sound we were able
to recover just by analyzing

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.873
the tiny motions in that video.

00:09:23.873 --> 00:09:26.682
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:42.471
I call it -- Thank you.

00:09:42.471 --> 00:09:47.696
(Applause)

00:09:49.878 --> 00:09:52.223
I call it the visual microphone.

00:09:52.223 --> 00:09:55.613
We actually extract audio signals
from video signals.

00:09:55.613 --> 00:09:58.794
And just to give you a sense
of the scale of the motions here,

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:04.135
a pretty loud sound will cause that bag
of chips to move less than a micrometer.

00:10:04.135 --> 00:10:06.874
That's one thousandth of a millimeter.

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:10.435
That's how tiny the motions are
that we are now able to pull out

00:10:10.435 --> 00:10:13.678
just by observing how light
bounces off objects

00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:15.814
and gets recorded by our cameras.

00:10:15.814 --> 00:10:19.064
We can recover sounds
from other objects, like plants.

00:10:19.064 --> 00:10:25.380
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

00:10:27.214 --> 00:10:29.211
And we can recover speech as well.

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:31.788
So here's a person speaking in a room.

00:10:31.788 --> 00:10:35.991
Voice: Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:40.221
and everywhere that Mary went,
that lamb was sure to go.

00:10:40.221 --> 00:10:42.980
Michael Rubinstein: And here's
that speech again recovered

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.254
just from this video
of that same bag of chips.

00:10:46.254 --> 00:10:51.085
Voice: Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:55.944
and everywhere that Mary went,
that lamb was sure to go.

00:10:55.944 --> 00:10:58.290
MR: We used "Mary Had a Little Lamb"

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.413
because those are said to be
the first words

00:11:00.413 --> 00:11:04.574
that Thomas Edison spoke 
into his phonograph in 1877.

00:11:04.574 --> 00:11:07.802
It was one of the first sound
recording devices in history.

00:11:07.802 --> 00:11:11.129
It basically directed the sounds
onto a diaphragm

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:15.208
that vibrated a needle that essentially
engraved the sound on tinfoil

00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:17.483
that was wrapped around the cylinder.

00:11:17.483 --> 00:11:23.426
Here's a demonstration of recording and 
replaying sound with Edison's phonograph.

00:11:23.426 --> 00:11:26.446
(Video) Voice: Testing,
testing, one two three.

00:11:26.446 --> 00:11:29.859
Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:11:29.859 --> 00:11:33.528
and everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

00:11:33.528 --> 00:11:36.268
Testing, testing, one two three.

00:11:36.268 --> 00:11:40.424
Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:11:40.424 --> 00:11:45.648
and everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

00:11:45.648 --> 00:11:49.665
MR: And now, 137 years later,

00:11:49.665 --> 00:11:53.752
we're able to get sound
in pretty much similar quality

00:11:53.752 --> 00:11:57.831
but by just watching objects
vibrate to sound with cameras,

00:11:57.831 --> 00:11:59.765
and we can even do that when the camera

00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:03.999
is 15 feet away from the object,
behind soundproof glass.

00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:07.219
So this is the sound that we were 
able to recover in that case.

00:12:07.219 --> 00:12:12.513
Voice: Mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow,

00:12:12.513 --> 00:12:17.272
and everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:21.034
MR: And of course, surveillance is
the first application that comes to mind.

00:12:21.034 --> 00:12:24.029
(Laughter)

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:28.085
But it might actually be useful
for other things as well.

00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:30.925
Maybe in the future, we'll be able
to use it, for example,

00:12:30.925 --> 00:12:33.177
to recover sound across space,

00:12:33.177 --> 00:12:36.753
because sound can't travel
in space, but light can.

00:12:36.753 --> 00:12:39.157
We've only just begun exploring

00:12:39.157 --> 00:12:42.176
other possible uses
for this new technology.

00:12:42.176 --> 00:12:45.008
It lets us see physical processes
that we know are there

00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:48.564
but that we've never been able
to see with our own eyes until now.

00:12:48.564 --> 00:12:49.768
This is our team.

00:12:49.768 --> 00:12:52.647
Everything I showed you today
is a result of a collaboration

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.838
with this great group
of people you see here,

00:12:54.838 --> 00:12:58.005
and I encourage you and welcome you
to check out our website,

00:12:58.005 --> 00:12:59.451
try it out yourself,

00:12:59.451 --> 00:13:02.423
and join us in exploring
this world of tiny motions.

00:13:02.423 --> 00:13:04.048
Thank you.

00:13:04.048 --> 00:13:05.302
