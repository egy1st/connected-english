00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm here to enlist you

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here is the old story -- we've already heard a little bit about it:

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
biology is war in which only the fiercest survive;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
businesses and nations succeed only by defeating,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
destroying and dominating competition;

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
politics is about your side winning at all costs.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in which cooperation, collective action and complex interdependencies

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
play a more important role.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And the central, but not all-important, role of competition and survival of the fittest

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
shrinks just a little bit to make room.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I started thinking about the relationship between communication, media

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs,"

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
In fact, if you look back, human communication media

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Humans have lived for much, much longer

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
in small family groups. Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits, gathering food.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And we don't know exactly how they did this,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
although they must have solved some collective action problems;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
while you're fighting with the other groups.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And again, we have no way of knowing,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So that raised a social question

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that I believe must have driven new social forms.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
to the hunters and their families?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And if so, how did they make arrangements?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
symbolic communication must have been involved.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Of course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
the first cities built of mud and brick, the first empires.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And it was the administers of these empires

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and the taxes that was owed on them

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
by making marks; marks on clay in that time.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Not too much longer after that, the alphabet was invented.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And this powerful tool was really reserved, for thousands of years,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000
for the elite administrators (Laughter) who kept track of accounts for the empires.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And then another communication technology enabled new media:

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the printing press came along, and within decades,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
millions of people became literate.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And from literate populations,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
religion and politics.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Not created by the printing press,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And again, new forms of wealth emerged.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Now, commerce is ancient. Markets are as old as the crossroads.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But capitalism, as we know it, is only a few hundred years old,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
such as the joint-stock ownership company,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
shared liability insurance, double-entry bookkeeping.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Now of course, the enabling technologies are based on the Internet,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and in the many-to-many era, every desktop is now a printing press,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
a broadcasting station, a community or a marketplace.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Evolution is speeding up.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
More recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant proportion, if not the majority of

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the human race, walking around holding, carrying or wearing supercomputers

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
linked at speeds greater

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
than what we consider to be broadband today.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Now, when I started looking into collective action,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call "social dilemmas."

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them:

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Now, when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
of the prisoner's dilemma,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
so I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
If you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly later. (Laughter)

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
in the early years of thinking about nuclear war:

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
two players who couldn't trust each other.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Let me just say that every unsecured transaction

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Person with the goods, person with the money,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
because they can't trust each other, are not going to exchange.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Neither one wants to be the first one

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
or they're going to get the sucker's payoff,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
but both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
If they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
a different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
as a probe of the biological question:

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
how does cooperation exist at all?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
He started a computer tournament for

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
is the ultimatum game,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and it's also a very interesting probe of

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Here's how the game is played: there are two players;

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
they've never played the game before,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
they will not play the game again, they don't know each other,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and they are, in fact, in separate rooms.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
First player is offered a hundred dollars

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and is asked to propose a split: 50/50, 90/10,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
whatever that player wants to propose. The second player either accepts the split --

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
both players are paid and the game is over --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
or rejects the split -- neither player is paid and the game is over.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Now, the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
because someone you don't know in another room is going to get 99.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to 50/50.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And although they were screened and didn't know about the game

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and had never played the game before,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
proposers seemed to innately know this

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50/50.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Now, the interesting part comes in more recently

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and discovered, to their surprise,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the Amazon

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
or nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures --

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
each had radically different ideas of what is fair.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that somehow the basis of our economic

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
transactions can be influenced by our social institutions,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
whether we know that or not.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
He used the example of a common grazing area in which each person

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
by simply maximizing their own flock

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
He had the rather gloomy conclusion that

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
in which people cannot be restrained from using it.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Now, Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist, in

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
which is: is it really true that humans will always despoil commons?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So she went out and looked at what data she could find.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
She looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000
forestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
humans destroyed the commons that they depended on.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma;

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
in fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
They escape by creating institutions for collective action.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And she discovered, I think most interestingly,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
that among those institutions that worked,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
there were a number of common design

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
principles, and those principles seem to be

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
missing from those institutions that don't work.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I'm moving very quickly over a number of

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
disciplines. In biology, the notions of symbiosis,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role


00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
in biology, from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And again, our notions of individuals as economic beings

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
have been overturned.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000
In fact, people will act to punish cheaters, even at a cost to themselves.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And most recently, neurophysiological measures

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
show activity in the reward centers of their brain.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
may be the glue that holds societies together.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Now, I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
in the past have helped create new economic forms.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Commerce is ancient. Markets are very old. Capitalism is fairly recent;

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
socialism emerged as a reaction to that.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
pointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperation

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
we may be moving into yet another economic form

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
that is significantly different from previous ones.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Very briefly, let's look at some businesses. IBM, as you know, HP, Sun --

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000
their software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Eli Lilly -- in, again, the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world --

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Toyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
treats them as a network and trains them to produce better,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism;

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
they're doing it because they're learning that

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Open source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Amazon has opened its Application Programming Interface

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
to 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
They're enriching others, not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Instead of, "Neither of us can trust each other, so we have to make suboptimal moves,"

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
it's, "You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate."

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000
We've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now:

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
it's a mechanism for rehydrating

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
cholera victims that's so simple to use it,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
illiterates can be trained to use it.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
making the system more efficient the more it is used.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Millions of people have contributed their desktop computers

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
when they're not using them to link together through the Internet

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
into supercomputing collectives

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers --

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
that's Folding@home at Stanford --

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
to crack codes, to search for life in outer space.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I don't think we know enough yet.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
but I think we can begin to think about them.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
but think about self-interest.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
This is all about self-interest that adds up to more.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
In El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
In the U.S., in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
citizens have self-organized political protests and

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Is an Apollo Project of cooperation possible?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
A transdisciplinary study of cooperation?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I believe that the payoff would be very big.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
I think we need to begin developing maps of this territory

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
so that we can talk about it across disciplines.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And I am not saying that understanding cooperation 


00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
is going to cause us to be better people --

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things --

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
but I will remind you that a few hundred years ago,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
When the scientific method provided that new way of thinking

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
suffering was alleviated.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
What forms of suffering could be alleviated,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
what forms of wealth could be created

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
if we knew a little bit more about cooperation?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
is automatically going to happen;

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
it's going to require effort.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
So I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Thank you.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
(Applause)
