00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.914
In the 1600s, there were so many
right whales in Cape Cod Bay

00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:06.741
off the east coast of the U.S.

00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:10.389
that apparently you could
walk across their backs

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.484
from one end of the bay to the other.

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:16.573
Today, they number in the hundreds,
and they're endangered.

00:00:16.573 --> 00:00:21.728
Like them, many species of whales
saw their numbers drastically reduced

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:24.170
by 200 years of whaling,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.889
where they were hunted and killed
for their whale meat, oil and whale bone.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.412
We only have whales in our waters today

00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:37.057
because of the Save the Whales
movement of the '70s.

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:40.455
It was instrumental in stopping
commercial whaling,

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:44.227
and was built on the idea that
if we couldn't save whales,

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:46.154
what could we save?

00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:49.080
It was ultimately a test
of our political ability

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.683
to halt environmental destruction.

00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:56.236
So in the early '80s, there was
a ban on commercial whaling

00:00:56.236 --> 00:00:59.951
that came into force
as a result of this campaign.

00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:02.760
Whales in our waters are still
low in numbers, however,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.489
because they do face a range
of other human-induced threats.

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:15.130
Unfortunately, many people still think
that whale conservationists like myself

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:20.509
do what we do only because these creatures
are charismatic and beautiful.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.025
This is actually a disservice,

00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:28.499
because whales are ecosystem engineers.

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.872
They help maintain the stability
and health of the oceans,

00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:37.299
and even provide services
to human society.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.275
So let's talk about why
saving whales is critical

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:44.806
to the resiliency of the oceans.

00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:49.334
It boils down to two main things:

00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:52.546
whale poop and rotting carcasses.

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:58.012
As whales dive to the depths to feed
and come up to the surface to breathe,

00:01:58.012 --> 00:02:01.918
they actually release these
enormous fecal plumes.

00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:03.662
This whale pump, as it's called,


00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:06.955
actually brings essential limiting 
nutrients from the depths

00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:10.975
to the surface waters where they 
stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,

00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:14.422
which forms the base
of all marine food chains.

00:02:14.422 --> 00:02:17.127
So really, having more whales
in the oceans pooping

00:02:17.127 --> 00:02:21.208
is really beneficial
to the entire ecosystem.

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:26.760
Whales are also known to undertake some 
of the longest migrations of all mammals.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.696
Gray whales off America
migrate 16,000 kilometers

00:02:32.707 --> 00:02:38.812
between productive feeding areas and less
productive calving, or birthing, areas

00:02:38.812 --> 00:02:41.902
and back every year.

00:02:41.902 --> 00:02:46.886
As they do so, they transport fertilizer
in the form of their feces

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:50.676
from places that have it
to places that need it.

00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:54.115
So clearly, whales are really
important in nutrient cycling,

00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:57.807
both horizontally and vertically,
through the oceans.

00:02:57.807 --> 00:03:04.466
But what's really cool is that they're 
also really important after they're dead.

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:08.559
Whale carcasses are some of 
the largest form of detritus

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:12.769
to fall from the ocean's surface, 
and they're called whale fall.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.466
As these carcasses sink,

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:18.495
they provide a feast
to some 400-odd species,

00:03:18.495 --> 00:03:22.331
including the eel-shaped, slime-producing 
hagfish.

00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.154
So over the 200 years of whaling,

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:29.524
when we were busy killing and removing
these carcasses from the oceans,

00:03:29.524 --> 00:03:35.246
we likely altered the rate and geographic 
distribution of these whale falls

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:37.563
that would descend into deep oceans,

00:03:37.563 --> 00:03:41.254
and as a result, probably led
to a number of extinctions

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:43.392
of species that were most specialized

00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:47.876
and dependent on these carcasses
for their survival.

00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:55.808
Whale carcasses are also known
to transport about 190,000 tons of carbon,

00:03:55.808 --> 00:03:58.106
which is the equivalent of that produced

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:01.171
by 80,000 cars per year

00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:04.000
from the atmosphere to the deep oceans,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.510
and the deep oceans
are what we call "carbon sinks,"

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.573
because they trap and hold
excess carbon from the atmosphere,

00:04:11.573 --> 00:04:15.789
and therefore help
to delay global warming.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.468
Sometimes these carcasses
also wash up on beaches

00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:24.540
and provide a meal to a number
of predatory species on land.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.464
The 200 years of whaling
was clearly detrimental

00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:31.356
and caused a reduction
in the populations of whales

00:04:31.356 --> 00:04:34.476
between 60 to 90 percent.

00:04:34.476 --> 00:04:36.302
Clearly, the Save the Whales movement

00:04:36.302 --> 00:04:40.713
was instrumental in preventing
commercial whaling from going on,

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:43.854
but we need to revise this.

00:04:43.854 --> 00:04:48.608
We need to address the more modern,
pressing problems that these whales face

00:04:48.608 --> 00:04:50.349
in our waters today.

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.482
Amongst other things, we need to stop them

00:04:52.482 --> 00:04:57.187
from getting plowed down by container 
ships when they're in their feeding areas,

00:04:57.187 --> 00:04:59.985
and stop them from getting
entangled in fishing nets

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:02.469
as they float around in the ocean.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.839
We also need to learn to contextualize
our conservation messages,

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:13.225
so people really understand the true 
ecosystem value of these creatures.

00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:18.142
So, let's save the whales again,

00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:22.275
but this time, let's not just 
do it for their sake.

00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:24.806
Let's also do it for ours.

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:27.151
Thank you.

00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:31.981
(Applause)
