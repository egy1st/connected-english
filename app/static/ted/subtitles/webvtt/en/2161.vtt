00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.968
I'm a tourism entrepreneur
and a peacebuilder,

00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:06.824
but this is not how I started.

00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:09.889
When I was seven years old,
I remember watching television

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.466
and seeing people throwing rocks,

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.856
and thinking, this must be
a fun thing to do.

00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:18.201
So I got out to the street
and threw rocks,

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:22.682
not realizing I was supposed
to throw rocks at Israeli cars.

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:26.908
Instead, I ended up stoning
my neighbors' cars. (Laughter)

00:00:26.908 --> 00:00:30.810
They were not enthusiastic
about my patriotism.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.904
This is my picture with my brother.

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:35.739
This is me, the little one,
and I know what you're thinking:

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.680
"You used to look cute,
what the heck happened to you?"

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.631
But my brother, who is older than me,

00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:43.045
was arrested when he was 18,

00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:45.994
taken to prison on charges
of throwing stones.

00:00:45.994 --> 00:00:49.570
He was beaten up when he refused
to confess that he threw stones,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.171
and as a result, had internal injuries

00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:56.814
that caused his death soon after
he was released from prison.

00:00:56.814 --> 00:01:00.460
I was angry, I was bitter,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.152
and all I wanted was revenge.

00:01:04.152 --> 00:01:06.659
But that changed when I was 18.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.096
I decided that I needed
Hebrew to get a job,

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:12.603
and going to study Hebrew
in that classroom

00:01:12.603 --> 00:01:18.037
was the first time I ever met Jews
who were not soldiers.

00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:22.919
And we connected over really small things,
like the fact that I love country music,

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:26.646
which is really strange
for Palestinians.

00:01:26.646 --> 00:01:31.306
But it was then that I realized also
that we have a wall of anger,

00:01:31.306 --> 00:01:36.919
of hatred and of ignorance
that separates us.

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:41.418
I decided that it doesn't matter
what happens to me.

00:01:41.418 --> 00:01:44.111
What really matters is how I deal with it.

00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:47.455
And therefore, I decided
to dedicate my life

00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:51.843
to bringing down the walls
that separate people.

00:01:51.843 --> 00:01:53.863
I do so through many ways.

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:56.963
Tourism is one of them,
but also media and education,

00:01:56.963 --> 00:02:00.657
and you might be wondering,
really, can tourism change things?

00:02:00.657 --> 00:02:02.367
Can it bring down walls? Yes.

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:07.087
Tourism is the best sustainable way
to bring down those walls

00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:11.472
and to create a sustainable way
of connecting with each other

00:02:11.472 --> 00:02:14.026
and creating friendships.

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:17.811
In 2009, I cofounded Mejdi Tours,

00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:21.271
a social enterprise that
aims to connect people,

00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:23.732
with two Jewish friends, by the way,

00:02:23.732 --> 00:02:26.031
and what we'll do, the model we did,

00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:29.537
for example, in Jerusalem,
we would have two tour guides,

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:32.996
one Israeli and one Palestinian,
guiding the trips together,

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:36.201
telling history and narrative
and archaeology and conflict

00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:39.173
from totally different perspectives.

00:02:39.173 --> 00:02:42.531
I remember running a trip together
with a friend named Kobi --

00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:45.555
Jewish congregation from Chicago,
the trip was in Jerusalem --

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:48.717
and we took them to a refugee camp,
a Palestinian refugee camp,

00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:50.817
and there we had this amazing food.

00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:53.700
By the way, this is my mother. She's cool.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.254
And that's the Palestinian
food called maqluba.

00:02:56.254 --> 00:02:57.571
It means "upside-down."

00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:00.795
You cook it with rice and chicken,
and you flip it upside-down.

00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:02.436
It's the best meal ever.

00:03:02.436 --> 00:03:03.744
And we'll eat together.

00:03:03.744 --> 00:03:06.548
Then we had a joint band,
Israeli and Palestinian musicians,

00:03:06.548 --> 00:03:08.405
and we did some belly-dancing.

00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:11.795
If you don't know any,
I'll teach you later.

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.907
But when we left, both sides,

00:03:14.907 --> 00:03:17.484
they were crying because
they did not want to leave.

00:03:17.484 --> 00:03:21.106
Three years later, those
relationships still exist.

00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:23.916
Imagine with me
if the one billion people

00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:27.723
who travel internationally 
every year travel like this,

00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:30.696
not being taken in the bus
from one side to another,

00:03:30.696 --> 00:03:33.017
from one hotel to another,

00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:36.988
taking pictures from the windows
of their buses of people and cultures,

00:03:36.988 --> 00:03:40.169
but actually connecting with people.

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.093
You know, I remember having
a Muslim group from the U.K.

00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:46.879
going to the house
of an Orthodox Jewish family,

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.268
and having their first Friday night
dinners, that Sabbath dinner,

00:03:51.268 --> 00:03:54.843
and eating together hamin,
which is a Jewish food, a stew,

00:03:54.843 --> 00:03:57.722
just having the connection
of realizing, after a while,

00:03:57.722 --> 00:04:00.694
that a hundred years ago,
their families came out

00:04:00.694 --> 00:04:03.773
of the same place in Northern Africa.

00:04:03.773 --> 00:04:06.848
This is not a photo profile
for your Facebook.

00:04:06.848 --> 00:04:08.682
This is not disaster tourism.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:11.050
This is the future of travel,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.114
and I invite you to join me to do that,
to change your travel.

00:04:14.114 --> 00:04:16.065
We're doing it all over the world now,

00:04:16.065 --> 00:04:18.503
from Ireland to Iran to Turkey,

00:04:18.503 --> 00:04:21.499
and we see ourselves going
everywhere to change the world.

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:22.729
Thank you.

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.633
(Applause)
