00:00:02.963 --> 00:00:05.988
It's said that to be a poet

00:00:06.948 --> 00:00:10.553
you have to go to hell and back.

00:00:12.173 --> 00:00:15.349
The first time I visited the prison,

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.025
I was not surprised by the noise
of the padlocks,

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:24.243
or the closing doors,
or the cell bars,

00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:28.246
or by any of the things
I had imagined.

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:33.559
Maybe because the prison
is in a quite open space.

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.689
You can see the sky.

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:39.332
Seagulls fly overhead,
and you feel like you're next to the sea,

00:00:39.332 --> 00:00:42.375
that you're really close to the beach.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:48.305
But in fact, the gulls are looking
for food in the dump near the prison.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.221
I went farther inside and I suddenly saw
inmates moving across the corridors.

00:00:55.886 --> 00:00:59.966
Then it was as if I stepped back
and thought

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:03.775
that I could have very well been
one of them.

00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:09.522
If I had another story,
another context, different luck.

00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:15.959
Because nobody - nobody -
can choose where they're born.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.453
In 2009, I was invited to join a project

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:27.860
that San Martín National University
conducted at the Unit 48 penitentiary,

00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:31.080
to coordinate a writing workshop.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.525
The prison service ceded some land
at the end of the prison,

00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:43.157
which is where they constructed
the University Center building.

00:01:44.152 --> 00:01:46.570
The first time I met with the prisoners,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.245
I asked them why they were asking
for a writing workshop

00:01:50.245 --> 00:01:53.896
and they told me they wanted 
to put on paper

00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:57.827
all that they couldn't say and do.

00:01:59.062 --> 00:02:03.929
Right then I decided that I wanted poetry
to enter the prison.

00:02:05.434 --> 00:02:09.038
So I said to them
why don't we work with poetry,

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:10.780
if they knew what poetry was.

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:16.267
But nobody had a clue
what poetry really was.

00:02:18.622 --> 00:02:20.256
They also suggested to me

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:22.775
that the workshop should be
not just for the inmates

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:28.031
taking university classes, 
but for all the inmates.

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:31.808
And so I said
that to start this workshop,

00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:35.650
I needed to find a tool
that we all had in common.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.756
That tool was language.

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:44.948
We had language, we had the workshop.
We could have poetry.

00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:50.774
But what I hadn't considered
was that inequality exists in prison, too.

00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:55.895
Many of the prisoners hadn't even
completed grammar school.

00:02:55.895 --> 00:03:01.275
Many couldn't use cursive,
could barely print.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.082
They didn't write fluently, either.

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:11.693
So we started looking for short poems.

00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:14.759
Very short, but very powerful.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.507
And we started to read, and we'd read
one author, then another author,

00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:23.982
and by reading such short poems,
they all began to realize

00:03:23.982 --> 00:03:28.639
that what the poetic language did
was to break a certain logic,

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.394
and create another system.

00:03:30.394 --> 00:03:33.988
Breaking the logic of language
also breaks the logic of the system

00:03:33.988 --> 00:03:37.755
under which they've learned to respond.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.043
So a new system appeared,

00:03:42.043 --> 00:03:47.202
new rules that made them
understand very quickly,

00:03:47.202 --> 00:03:49.081
- very quickly -

00:03:49.081 --> 00:03:51.230
that with poetic language

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.739
they would be able to say
absolutely whatever they wanted.

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:04.570
It's said that to be a poet
you have to go to hell and back.

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:09.974
And they have plenty of hell.
Plenty of hell.

00:04:09.974 --> 00:04:14.589
One of them once said:
"In prison you never sleep.

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:19.454
You can never sleep in jail.
You can never close your eyelids."

00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:26.707
And so, like I’m doing now,
I gave them a moment of silence,

00:04:26.707 --> 00:04:31.429
then said,
“That's what poetry is, you guys.

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:37.494
It's in this prison universe
that you have all around you.

00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:39.774
Everything you say
about how you never sleep,

00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:41.464
it exudes fear.

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:46.229
All the things that go unwritten --
all of that is poetry."

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:51.676
So we started appropriating that hell;

00:04:51.676 --> 00:04:55.184
we plunged ourselves, headfirst,
into the seventh circle.

00:04:55.184 --> 00:04:59.222
And in that seventh circle of hell,
our very own, beloved circle,

00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:03.434
they learned that they could
make the walls invisible,

00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:05.604
that they could make the windows yell,

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:08.544
and that we could hide inside the shadows.

00:05:11.504 --> 00:05:15.464
When the first year
of the workshop had ended,

00:05:15.464 --> 00:05:17.872
we organized a little closing party,

00:05:17.872 --> 00:05:21.562
like you do when a job is done
with so much love,

00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:24.512
and you want to celebrate with a party.

00:05:24.512 --> 00:05:28.979
We called family, friends, 
the university authorities.

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.321
The only thing the inmates
had to do was read a poem,

00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:35.558
and receive their diplomas and applause.

00:05:35.558 --> 00:05:38.085
That was our simple party.

00:05:40.105 --> 00:05:45.004
The only thing I want to leave you with

00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:51.019
is the moment in which those men,

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:53.514
some of them just huge
when standing next to me,

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:59.230
or the young boys - so young,
but with an enormous pride,

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.073
held their papers and trembled
like little kids and sweated,

00:06:05.078 --> 00:06:10.287
and read their poems with their
voices completely broken.

00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:16.009
That moment made me think a lot

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:21.066
that for most of them,
it was surely the very first time

00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:25.564
that someone applauded them
for something they had done.

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:32.262
In prison there are things
that can't be done.

00:06:32.262 --> 00:06:37.118
In prison, you can't dream.
In prison, you can't cry.

00:06:37.118 --> 00:06:42.147
There are words that are virtually
forbidden, like the word "time,"

00:06:42.147 --> 00:06:47.016
the word "future," the word "wish".

00:06:47.016 --> 00:06:52.322
But we dared to dream, and to dream a lot.

00:06:52.322 --> 00:06:57.126
We decided
that they were going to write a book.

00:06:57.126 --> 00:07:01.546
Not only did they write a book,
but they also bound it themselves.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.642
That was at the end of 2010.

00:07:04.642 --> 00:07:09.051
Then, we doubled the bet
and wrote another book.

00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:10.685
And we bound that one, too.

00:07:10.685 --> 00:07:14.109
That was a short time ago,
at the end of last year.

00:07:16.474 --> 00:07:20.000
What I see week after week,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.357
is how they're turning
into different people;

00:07:24.357 --> 00:07:26.904
how they're being transformed.

00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:31.251
How words are empowering them
with a dignity they had never known,

00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:33.334
that they couldn't even imagine.

00:07:33.334 --> 00:07:38.125
They had no idea such dignity
could come from them.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:46.397
At the workshop, in that beloved hell
we share, we all give something.

00:07:46.397 --> 00:07:50.997
We open our hands and hearts and give
what we have, what we can.

00:07:50.997 --> 00:07:53.151
All of us;
all of us equally.

00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:57.766
And so you feel that at least
in a small way

00:07:57.766 --> 00:08:01.416
you're repairing
that huge social fracture

00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:06.634
which makes it so that for many of them,

00:08:06.634 --> 00:08:09.812
prison is their only destination.

00:08:12.172 --> 00:08:17.551
I remember a verse
by a tremendous poet, a great poet,

00:08:18.586 --> 00:08:24.430
from our Unit 48 workshop,
Nicolás Dorado:

00:08:28.395 --> 00:08:34.789
"I will need an infinite thread
to sew up this huge wound."

00:08:35.485 --> 00:08:40.679
Poetry does that; it sews up
the wounds of exclusion.

00:08:41.004 --> 00:08:46.242
It opens doors. 
Poetry works as a mirror.

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:49.762
It creates a mirror, which is the poem.

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:53.745
They recognize themselves,
they look at themselves in the poem

00:08:53.745 --> 00:08:58.808
and write from who they are,
and are from what they write.

00:08:58.808 --> 00:09:01.513
In order to write,

00:09:01.513 --> 00:09:05.704
they need to appropriate
the moment of writing

00:09:05.704 --> 00:09:09.155
which is a moment
of extraordinary freedom.

00:09:09.155 --> 00:09:12.098
They have to get into their heads,
search for that bit of freedom

00:09:12.098 --> 00:09:17.124
that can never be taken away
when they write

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:20.635
and that is also useful
to realize that freedom is possible

00:09:20.635 --> 00:09:22.973
even inside a prison,

00:09:22.973 --> 00:09:28.235
and that the only bars we have
in our wonderful space

00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:30.097
is the word "bars,"

00:09:30.097 --> 00:09:33.959
and that all of us in our hell
burn with happiness

00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:37.669
when we light the wick of the word.

00:09:37.669 --> 00:09:40.669
(Applause)

00:10:05.143 --> 00:10:11.597
I told you a lot about the prison,
a lot about what I experience

00:10:11.597 --> 00:10:16.178
every week, and how I enjoy it
and transform myself with the inmates.

00:10:16.178 --> 00:10:19.593
But you don't know how much I'd like it

00:10:19.593 --> 00:10:25.159
if you could feel, live, experience,
even for a few seconds,

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:29.494
what I enjoy every week
and what makes me who I am.

00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:35.151
(Applause)

00:10:41.228 --> 00:10:45.459
Martín Bustamante: 
The heart chews tears of time;

00:10:45.464 --> 00:10:48.346
blinded by that light,

00:10:48.346 --> 00:10:51.721
it hides the speed of existence

00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:53.874
where the images go rowing by.

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:56.847
It fights; it hangs on.

00:10:56.847 --> 00:11:00.549
The heart cracks under sad gazes,

00:11:00.554 --> 00:11:04.327
rides on storms that spread fire,

00:11:04.327 --> 00:11:07.451
lifts chests lowered by shame,

00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:10.627
knows that it's not just reading
and going on,

00:11:10.627 --> 00:11:14.452
it also wishes to see the infinite blue.

00:11:14.457 --> 00:11:18.185
The heart sits down to think about things,

00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:20.897
fights to avoid being ordinary,

00:11:20.897 --> 00:11:24.320
tries to love without hurting,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.023
breathes the sun,
giving courage to itself,

00:11:28.023 --> 00:11:32.391
surrenders, travels toward reason.

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:35.294
The heart fights among the swamps,

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:38.819
skirts the edge of the underworld,

00:11:38.819 --> 00:11:43.101
falls exhausted, but won't give in
to what's easy,

00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:45.590
while irregular steps of intoxication

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.167
wake up,

00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:49.057
wake the stillness.

00:11:49.057 --> 00:11:51.029
I'm Martín Bustamante,

00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:55.254
I'm a prisoner in Unit 48 of San Martín,

00:11:55.254 --> 00:11:58.112
today is my day of temporary release.

00:11:58.112 --> 00:12:01.784
And for me, poetry and literature
have changed my life.

00:12:01.784 --> 00:12:02.905
Thank you very much!

00:12:02.905 --> 00:12:04.325
Cristina Domenech: Thank you!

00:12:04.325 --> 00:12:06.645
(Applause)
