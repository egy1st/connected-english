WEBVTT

00:00:00.764 --> 00:00:04.094
Let's go south.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:10.539
All of you are actually going south.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:15.229
This is the direction of south, this way,

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:21.749
and if you go 8,000 kilometers
out of the back of this room,

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.982
you will come to as far south
as you can go anywhere on Earth,

00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:29.393
the Pole itself.

00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:33.201
Now, I am not an explorer.

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:36.753
I'm not an environmentalist.

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:40.282
I'm actually just a survivor,

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:45.851
and these photographs
that I'm showing you here are dangerous.

00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:51.976
They are the ice melt
of the South and North Poles.

00:00:51.976 --> 00:00:53.516
And ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:59.944
we need to listen to what
these places are telling us,

00:00:59.944 --> 00:01:06.190
and if we don't, we will end up
with our own survival situation

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.636
here on planet Earth.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:15.668
I have faced head-on these places,

00:01:15.668 --> 00:01:20.196
and to walk across a melting ocean of ice

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:23.330
is without doubt
the most frightening thing

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.117
that's ever happened to me.

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:33.064
Antarctica is such a hopeful place.

00:01:33.064 --> 00:01:39.695
It is protected by 
the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959.

00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:47.100
In 1991, a 50-year agreement
was entered into

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.855
that stops any exploitation in Antarctica,

00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:57.695
and this agreement could be altered,

00:01:57.695 --> 00:02:03.058
changed, modified, or even abandoned

00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:07.907
starting in the year 2041.

00:02:09.527 --> 00:02:12.299
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:18.267
people already far up north
from here in the Arctic

00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:21.378
are already taking advantage

00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:25.325
of this ice melt,

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:31.553
taking out resources from areas
already that have been covered in ice

00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:34.961
for the last 10, 20, 30,000,

00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:38.305
100,000 years.

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:41.578
Can they not join the dots

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:47.940
and think, "Why is the ice
actually melting?"

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.284
This is such an amazing place,

00:02:51.284 --> 00:02:55.138
the Antarctic, and I have worked hard

00:02:55.138 --> 00:03:00.293
for the last 23 years on this mission

00:03:00.293 --> 00:03:04.297
to make sure that what's happening
up here in the North

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:09.716
does never happen, 
cannot happen in the South.

00:03:09.716 --> 00:03:11.508
Where did this all begin?

00:03:11.508 --> 00:03:14.457
It began for me at the age of 11.

00:03:14.457 --> 00:03:17.452
Check out that haircut. 
It's a bit odd. (Laughter)

00:03:17.452 --> 00:03:22.556
And at the age of 11, 
I was inspired by the real explorers

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:27.320
to want to try to be the first
to walk to both Poles.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.685
I found it incredibly inspiring

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:35.563
that the idea of becoming a polar traveler

00:03:35.563 --> 00:03:39.910
went down pretty well with girls 
at parties when I was at university.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.878
That was a bit more inspiring.

00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:45.500
And after years, seven
years of fundraising,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.147
seven years of being told no,

00:03:48.147 --> 00:03:54.393
seven years of being told
by my family to seek counseling

00:03:54.393 --> 00:03:58.155
and psychiatric help,

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:04.112
eventually three of us found ourselves
marching to the South Geographic Pole

00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:10.140
on the longest unassisted march
ever made anywhere on Earth in history.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.874
In this photograph,
we are standing in an area

00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:17.612
the size of the United States of America,

00:04:17.612 --> 00:04:18.936
and we're on our own.

00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:22.467
We have no radio 
communications, no backup.

00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:29.281
Beneath our feet,
90 percent of all the world's ice,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.353
70 percent of all the world's fresh water.

00:04:34.353 --> 00:04:36.095
We're standing on it.

00:04:36.095 --> 00:04:40.762
This is the power of Antarctica.

00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:44.268
On this journey, we faced
the danger of crevasses,

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:46.566
intense cold,

00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:52.046
so cold that sweat turns
to ice inside your clothing,

00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:53.834
your teeth can crack,

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:55.993
water can freeze in your eyes.

00:04:55.993 --> 00:04:59.058
Let's just say it's a bit chilly.
(Laughter)

00:04:59.058 --> 00:05:03.229
And after 70 desperate days,
we arrive at the South Pole.

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.977
We had done it.

00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:10.696
But something happened to me
on that 70-day journey in 1986

00:05:10.696 --> 00:05:13.500
that brought me here, and it hurt.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.615
My eyes changed color
in 70 days through damage.

00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:20.652
Our faces blistered out.

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:25.644
The skin ripped off
and we wondered why.

00:05:25.644 --> 00:05:29.173
And when we got home,
we were told by NASA

00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:32.029
that a hole in the ozone
had been discovered

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:33.562
above the South Pole,

00:05:33.562 --> 00:05:38.925
and we'd walked underneath it
the same year it had been discovered.

00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:44.896
Ultraviolet rays down, hit the ice,
bounced back, fried out the eyes,

00:05:44.896 --> 00:05:48.027
ripped off our faces.

00:05:48.027 --> 00:05:51.371
It was a bit of a shock --
(Laughter) --

00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:54.877
and it started me thinking.

00:05:54.877 --> 00:05:58.104
In 1989, we now head north.

00:05:58.104 --> 00:06:02.743
Sixty days, every step away
from the safety of land

00:06:02.743 --> 00:06:04.629
across a frozen ocean.

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.854
It was desperately cold again.

00:06:06.854 --> 00:06:12.937
Here's me coming in from washing
naked at -60 Celsius.

00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:18.304
And if anybody ever says to you,
"I am cold" -- (Laughter) --

00:06:18.305 --> 00:06:24.040
if they look like this, 
they are cold, definitely.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.958
(Applause)

00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:32.982
And 1,000 kilometers away
from the safety of land,

00:06:32.982 --> 00:06:35.646
disaster strikes.

00:06:35.646 --> 00:06:43.401
The Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet
four months before it ever had in history,

00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:46.910
and we're 1,000 kilometers from safety.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:52.684
The ice is crashing around us, grinding,
and I'm thinking, "Are we going to die?"

00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:57.614
But something clicked
in my head on this day,

00:06:57.614 --> 00:07:04.706
as I realized we, as a world,
are in a survival situation,

00:07:04.706 --> 00:07:09.070
and that feeling has never gone away
for 25 long years.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.543
Back then, we had to march or die.

00:07:13.543 --> 00:07:17.351
And we're not some TV survivor program.

00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:20.282
When things go wrong for us,
it's life or death,

00:07:20.282 --> 00:07:23.596
and our brave African-American Daryl,

00:07:23.596 --> 00:07:27.474
who would become the first American
to walk to the North Pole,

00:07:27.474 --> 00:07:32.064
his heel dropped off 
from frostbite 200 klicks out.

00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:34.231
He must keep going, he does,

00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:39.061
and after 60 days on the ice,
we stood at the North Pole.

00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:40.555
We had done it.

00:07:40.555 --> 00:07:45.825
Yes, I became the first person in history
stupid enough to walk to both Poles,

00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:48.217
but it was our success.

00:07:49.387 --> 00:07:53.247
And sadly, on return home,

00:07:53.247 --> 00:07:56.382
it was not all fun.

00:07:56.382 --> 00:07:58.123
I became very low.

00:07:58.123 --> 00:08:04.412
To succeed at something is often harder
than actually making it happen.

00:08:04.412 --> 00:08:08.525
I was empty, lonely,
financially destroyed.

00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:10.870
I was without hope,

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.585
but hope came in the form
of the great Jacques Cousteau,

00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:19.981
and he inspired me to take on 
the 2041 mission.

00:08:19.981 --> 00:08:23.153
Being Jacques, he gave me
clear instructions:

00:08:23.153 --> 00:08:27.550
Engage the world leaders,
talk to industry and business,

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.489
and above all, Rob, inspire young people,

00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:36.344
because they will choose the future
of the preservation of Antarctica.

00:08:36.344 --> 00:08:40.730
For the world leaders, we've been
to every world Earth Summit,

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:45.095
all three of them,
with our brave yacht, 2041,

00:08:45.095 --> 00:08:49.925
twice to Rio, once in '92, once in 2012,

00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:53.547
and for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg,

00:08:53.547 --> 00:09:00.859
we made the longest overland voyage
ever made with a yacht,

00:09:00.861 --> 00:09:05.040
13,000 kilometers around
the whole of Southern Africa

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:11.518
doing our best to inspire
over a million young people in person

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:16.580
about 2041 and about their environment.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:23.495
For the last 11 years,
we have taken over 1,000 people,

00:09:23.499 --> 00:09:26.518
people from industry and business,
women and men from companies,

00:09:26.518 --> 00:09:30.893
students from all over the world,
down to Antarctica,

00:09:30.893 --> 00:09:34.002
and during those missions,
we've managed to pull out

00:09:34.002 --> 00:09:39.652
over 1,500 tons of twisted metal
left in Antarctica.

00:09:39.652 --> 00:09:43.111
That took eight years,
and I'm so proud of it

00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:50.246
because we recycled all of it 
back here in South America.

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:53.754
I have been inspired
ever since I could walk

00:09:53.754 --> 00:09:57.051
to recycle by my mum.

00:09:57.051 --> 00:09:59.528
Here she is, and my mum --

00:09:59.528 --> 00:10:03.175
(Applause) --

00:10:03.175 --> 00:10:05.872
my mum is still recycling,

00:10:05.872 --> 00:10:10.847
and as she is in her 100th year,
isn't that fantastic?

00:10:10.847 --> 00:10:13.197
(Applause)

00:10:13.197 --> 00:10:16.439
And when -- I love my mum.

00:10:16.439 --> 00:10:17.559
(Laughter)

00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:20.780
But when Mum was born,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:27.119
the population of our planet
was only 1.8 billion people,

00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:29.070
and talking in terms of billions,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.738
we have taken young people
from industry and business

00:10:32.738 --> 00:10:34.944
from India, from China.

00:10:34.944 --> 00:10:40.724
These are game-changing nations,
and will be hugely important

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:45.544
in the decision about
the preservation of the Antarctic.

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:52.393
Unbelievably, we've engaged and inspired
women to come from the Middle East,

00:10:52.393 --> 00:10:58.551
often for the first time they've 
represented their nations in Antarctica.

00:10:58.551 --> 00:11:01.066
Fantastic people, so inspired.

00:11:01.066 --> 00:11:04.322
To look after Antarctica,

00:11:04.322 --> 00:11:10.658
you've got to first engage people
with this extraordinary place,

00:11:10.658 --> 00:11:14.858
form a relationship, form a bond,

00:11:14.858 --> 00:11:17.621
form some love.

00:11:17.621 --> 00:11:21.080
It is such a privilege
to go to Antarctica,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.427
I can't tell you.

00:11:22.427 --> 00:11:24.006
I feel so lucky,

00:11:24.006 --> 00:11:27.233
and I've been 35 times in my life,

00:11:27.233 --> 00:11:31.951
and all those people who come with us
return home as great champions,

00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:33.899
not only for Antarctica,

00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:37.543
but for local issues
back in their own nations.

00:11:37.543 --> 00:11:43.891
Let's go back to where we began:
the ice melt of the North and South Poles.

00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:46.433
And it's not good news.

00:11:47.713 --> 00:11:51.689
NASA informed us six months ago

00:11:51.689 --> 00:11:56.688
that the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf
is now disintegrating.

00:11:56.688 --> 00:11:59.113
Huge areas of ice --

00:11:59.113 --> 00:12:03.385
look how big Antarctica is
even compared to here --

00:12:03.385 --> 00:12:07.926
Huge areas of ice 
are breaking off from Antarctica,

00:12:07.926 --> 00:12:10.761
the size of small nations.

00:12:10.761 --> 00:12:15.166
And NASA have calculated
that the sea level will rise,

00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:17.340
it is definite,

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.753
by one meter in the next 100 years,

00:12:20.753 --> 00:12:24.288
the same time that my mum
has been on planet Earth.

00:12:24.288 --> 00:12:25.978
It's going to happen,

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:30.309
and I've realized that 
the preservation of Antarctica

00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:36.194
and our survival here on Earth are linked.

00:12:36.194 --> 00:12:38.088
And there is a very simple solution.

00:12:38.088 --> 00:12:43.607
If we are using more renewable energy
in the real world,

00:12:43.607 --> 00:12:49.469
if we are being more efficient
with the energy here,

00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:53.765
running our energy mix in a cleaner way,

00:12:53.765 --> 00:12:58.611
there will be no financial reason
to go and exploit Antarctica.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.670
It won't make financial sense,

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:07.366
and if we manage our energy better,
we also may be able to slow down,

00:13:08.366 --> 00:13:10.506
maybe even stop,

00:13:10.506 --> 00:13:13.547
this great ice melt that threatens us.

00:13:13.547 --> 00:13:17.097
It's a big challenge, and what
is our response to it?

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:21.069
We've got to go back one last time,

00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:22.965
and at the end of next year,

00:13:22.965 --> 00:13:26.800
we will go back to the
South Geographic Pole,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.052
where we arrived 30 years ago on foot,

00:13:31.052 --> 00:13:36.777
and retrace our steps of 1,600 kilometers,

00:13:36.777 --> 00:13:42.827
but this time only using
renewable energy to survive.

00:13:42.827 --> 00:13:48.386
We will walk across those icecaps,
which far down below are melting,

00:13:48.386 --> 00:13:53.295
hopefully inspiring some
solutions on that issue.

00:13:53.295 --> 00:13:55.720
This is my son, Barney.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.511
He is coming with me.

00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:03.261
He is committed to walking
side by side with his father,

00:14:03.261 --> 00:14:07.275
and what he will do is
to translate these messages

00:14:07.275 --> 00:14:12.900
and inspire these messages
to the minds of future young leaders.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.939
I'm extremely proud of him.

00:14:14.939 --> 00:14:18.421
Good on him, Barney.

00:14:19.623 --> 00:14:25.609
Ladies and gentlemen, 
a survivor -- and I'm good --

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:33.535
a survivor sees a problem
and doesn't go, "Whatever."

00:14:34.686 --> 00:14:38.846
A survivor sees a problem
and deals with that problem

00:14:38.846 --> 00:14:41.919
before it becomes a threat.

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:47.967
We have 27 years
to preserve the Antarctic.

00:14:47.967 --> 00:14:50.482
We all own it.

00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:53.262
We all have responsibility.

00:14:53.262 --> 00:14:58.232
The fact that nobody owns it 
maybe means that we can succeed.

00:14:58.232 --> 00:15:03.051
Antarctica is a moral line in the snow,

00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:06.598
and on one side of that line
we should fight,

00:15:06.598 --> 00:15:12.311
fight hard for this one beautiful,
pristine place left alone on Earth.

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:14.472
I know it's possible.

00:15:14.472 --> 00:15:16.492
We are going to do it.

00:15:16.492 --> 00:15:20.370
And I'll leave you with
these words from Goethe.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.497
I've tried to live by them.

00:15:23.977 --> 00:15:29.858
"If you can do, or dream you can,

00:15:31.262 --> 00:15:34.234
begin it now,

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:41.026
for boldness has genius,
power and magic in it."

00:15:41.026 --> 00:15:42.590
Good luck to you all.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.750
Thank you very much.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:49.115
(Applause)
