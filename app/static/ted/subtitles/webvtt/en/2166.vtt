00:00:00.847 --> 00:00:05.818
When the Portuguese arrived
in Latin America about 500 years ago,

00:00:05.818 --> 00:00:08.928
they obviously found
this amazing tropical forest.

00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:13.165
And among all this biodiversity
that they had never seen before,

00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:17.335
they found one species that caught
their attention very quickly.

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:23.580
This species, when you cut the bark,
you find a very dark red resin

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.354
that was very good to paint
and dye fabric to make clothes.

00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:33.799
The indigenous people called
this species pau brasil,

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:39.586
and that's the reason why this land became
"land of Brasil," and later on, Brazil.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.356
That's the only country in the world
that has the name of a tree.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:49.560
So you can imagine that it's very cool
to be a forester in Brazil,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.507
among other reasons.

00:00:51.507 --> 00:00:54.393
Forest products are all around us.

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:56.326
Apart from all those products,

00:00:56.326 --> 00:01:00.219
the forest is very important
for climate regulation.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.453
In Brazil, almost 70 percent
of the evaporation that makes rain

00:01:05.453 --> 00:01:07.894
actually comes from the forest.

00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:14.846
Just the Amazon pumps to the atmosphere
20 billion tons of water every day.

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:21.456
This is more than what the Amazon River,
which is the largest river in the world,

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:26.116
puts in the sea per day,
which is 17 billion tons.

00:01:26.116 --> 00:01:31.201
If we had to boil water to get
the same effect as evapotranspiration,

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:36.700
we would need six months of the entire
power generation capacity of the world.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.895
So it's a hell of a service for all of us.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.595
We have in the world
about four billion hectares of forests.

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:50.232
This is more or less China, U.S.,
Canada and Brazil all together,

00:01:50.232 --> 00:01:52.536
in terms of size, to have an idea.

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:56.646
Three quarters of that
is in the temperate zone,

00:01:56.646 --> 00:02:00.009
and just one quarter is in the tropics,

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.023
but this one quarter, one billion
hectares, holds most of the biodiversity,

00:02:06.023 --> 00:02:10.472
and very importantly, 50 percent
of the living biomass, the carbon.

00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:16.229
Now, we used to have
six billion hectares of forest --

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:20.072
50 percent more than
what we have -- 2,000 years ago.

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:23.638
We've actually lost two billion hectares
in the last 2,000 years.

00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:27.915
But in the last 100 years,
we lost half of that.

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:32.614
That was when we shifted
from deforestation of temperate forests

00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:34.520
to deforestation of tropical forests.

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:39.439
So think of this: In 100 years,

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.275
we lost the same amount
of forest in the tropics

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:46.916
that we lost in 2,000 years
in temperate forests.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.523
That's the speed of the destruction
that we are having.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.895
Now, Brazil is an important
piece of this puzzle.

00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:58.655
We have the second largest
forest in the world, just after Russia.

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:02.341
It means 12 percent of all
the world's forests are in Brazil,

00:03:02.341 --> 00:03:04.153
most of that in the Amazon.

00:03:04.153 --> 00:03:07.597
It's the largest piece of forest we have.
It's a very big, large area.

00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:10.979
You can see that you could fit
many of the European countries there.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.482
We still have 80 percent
of the forest cover.

00:03:14.482 --> 00:03:16.111
That's the good news.

00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:20.818
But we lost 15 percent in just 30 years.

00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:22.706
So if you go with that speed,

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:27.745
very soon, we will loose this powerful
pump that we have in the Amazon

00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:30.010
that regulates our climate.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.873
Deforestation was growing
fast and accelerating

00:03:32.873 --> 00:03:35.714
at the end of the '90s
and the beginning of the 2000s.

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:39.641
(Chainsaw sound)

00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:43.598
(Sound of falling tree)

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:47.947
Twenty-seven thousand
square kilometers in one year.

00:03:47.947 --> 00:03:51.602
This is 2.7 million hectares.

00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:56.543
It's almost like half
of Costa Rica every year.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:01.639
So at this moment -- this is 2003, 2004 --

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.116
I happened to be coming to work
in the government.

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:10.566
And together with other teammates
in the National Forest Department,

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:16.293
we were assigned a task to join a team
and find out the causes of deforestation,

00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:19.005
and make a plan to combat that
at a national level,

00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:22.341
involving the local governments,
the civil society,

00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:24.184
business, local communities,

00:04:24.184 --> 00:04:27.217
in an effort that could
tackle those causes.

00:04:27.217 --> 00:04:33.019
So we came up with this plan
with 144 actions in different areas.

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:35.366
Now I will go through
all of them one by one --

00:04:35.366 --> 00:04:42.170
no, just giving some examples
of what we had done in the next few years.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.896
So the first thing, we set up a system
with the national space agency

00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:50.903
that could actually see
where deforestation is happening,

00:04:50.903 --> 00:04:52.404
almost in real time.

00:04:52.404 --> 00:04:54.788
So now in Brazil, 
we have this system, DETER,

00:04:54.788 --> 00:04:58.083
where every month,
or every two months,

00:04:58.083 --> 00:05:00.867
we get information on
where deforestation is happening

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:03.735
so we can actually act
when it's happening.

00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:05.878
And all the information
is fully transparent

00:05:05.878 --> 00:05:08.862
so others can replicate that
in independent systems.

00:05:08.862 --> 00:05:10.841
This allows us, among other things,

00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:17.452
to apprehend 1.4 million cubic meters
of logs that were illegally taken.

00:05:17.452 --> 00:05:23.067
Part of that we saw and sell,
and all the revenue becomes a fund

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:27.991
that now funds conservation projects
of local communities as an endowment fund.

00:05:28.755 --> 00:05:31.189
This also allows us
to make a big operation

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.914
to seize corruption and illegal activities

00:05:33.914 --> 00:05:39.187
that ended up having 700 people in prison,
including a lot of public servants.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.172
Then we made the connection
that areas that have been doing

00:05:44.172 --> 00:05:48.525
illegal deforestation should not get
any kind of credit or finance.

00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:53.037
So we cut this through the bank system
and then linked this to the end users.

00:05:53.037 --> 00:05:55.442
So supermarkets,
the slaughterhouses, and so on

00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:58.868
that buy products
from illegal clear-cut areas,

00:05:58.868 --> 00:06:02.526
they also can be liable
for the deforestation.

00:06:02.526 --> 00:06:06.110
So making all these connections to help
to push the problem down.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.503
And also we work a lot
on land tenure issues.

00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:11.701
It's very important for conflicts.

00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:14.707
Fifty million hectares
of protected areas were created,

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:20.496
which is an area the size of Spain.

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:24.743
And of those, eight million
were indigenous lands.

00:06:24.743 --> 00:06:28.429
Now we start to see results.

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:30.928
So in the last 10 years,

00:06:30.928 --> 00:06:34.532
deforestation came down
in Brazil 75 percent.

00:06:34.532 --> 00:06:40.143
(Applause)

00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:43.915
So if we compare it
with the average deforestation

00:06:43.915 --> 00:06:46.177
that we had in the last decade,

00:06:46.177 --> 00:06:51.181
we saved 8.7 million hectares,
which is the size of Austria.

00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:53.694
But more importantly,
it avoided the emission

00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:56.579
of three billion tons
of CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:01.653
This is by far the largest contribution
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:04.245
until today, as a positive action.

00:07:05.727 --> 00:07:08.908
One may think that when you do
these kinds of actions

00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:12.037
to decrease, to push down deforestation,

00:07:12.037 --> 00:07:14.135
you will have an economic impact

00:07:14.135 --> 00:07:18.285
because you will not have
economic activity or something like that.

00:07:18.297 --> 00:07:21.084
But it's interesting to know
that it's quite the opposite.

00:07:21.084 --> 00:07:25.959
In fact, in the period when we have
the deepest decline of deforestation,

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:30.108
the economy grew, on average,
double from the previous decade,

00:07:30.108 --> 00:07:32.697
when deforestation was actually going up.

00:07:32.697 --> 00:07:34.752
So it's a good lesson for us.

00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:37.100
Maybe this is completely disconnected,

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.651
as we just learned by having
deforestation come down.

00:07:41.167 --> 00:07:45.120
Now this is all good news,
and it's quite an achievement,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.448
and we obviously should be
very proud about that.

00:07:48.448 --> 00:07:51.219
But it's not even close to sufficient.

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:56.109
In fact, if you think about
the deforestation in the Amazon in 2013,

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:59.748
that was over half a million hectares,

00:07:59.748 --> 00:08:02.412
which means that every minute,

00:08:02.412 --> 00:08:05.785
an area the size of two soccer fields

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:09.665
is being cut in the Amazon
last year, just last year.

00:08:09.665 --> 00:08:13.748
If we sum up the deforestation we have
in the other biomes in Brazil,

00:08:13.748 --> 00:08:17.820
we are talking about still the largest
deforestation rate in the world.

00:08:19.114 --> 00:08:22.459
It's more or less like
we are forest heroes,

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:24.540
but still deforestation champions.

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:30.327
So we can't be satisfied,
not even close to satisfied.

00:08:30.327 --> 00:08:32.136
So the next step, I think,

00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:36.687
is to fight to have zero loss
of forest cover in Brazil

00:08:36.687 --> 00:08:40.062
and to have that as a goal for 2020.

00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:41.422
That's our next step.

00:08:41.422 --> 00:08:44.407
Now I've always been interested
in the relationship

00:08:44.407 --> 00:08:46.431
between climate change and forests.

00:08:46.431 --> 00:08:52.182
First, because 15 percent of greenhouse
gas emissions come from deforestation,

00:08:52.182 --> 00:08:54.454
so it's a big part of the problem.

00:08:54.454 --> 00:08:57.570
But also, forests can be
a big part of the solution

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:04.694
since that's the best way we know
to sink, capture and store carbon.

00:09:04.694 --> 00:09:07.487
Now, there is another relationship
of climate and forests

00:09:07.487 --> 00:09:11.553
that really stuck me in 2008
and made me change my career

00:09:11.553 --> 00:09:15.039
from forests to working
with climate change.

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:17.724
I went to visit Canada,
in British Columbia,

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:22.738
together with the chiefs of
the forest services of other countries

00:09:22.738 --> 00:09:29.143
that we have a kind of alliance of them,
like Canada, Russia, India, China, U.S.

00:09:29.143 --> 00:09:34.256
And when we were there
we learned about this pine beetle

00:09:34.257 --> 00:09:37.547
that is literally eating
the forests in Canada.

00:09:37.547 --> 00:09:43.819
What we see here, those brown trees,
these are really dead trees.

00:09:43.819 --> 00:09:48.384
They are standing dead trees
because of the larvae of the beetle.

00:09:48.384 --> 00:09:51.429
What happens is that this beetle

00:09:51.429 --> 00:09:54.229
is controlled by
the cold weather in the winter.

00:09:54.229 --> 00:09:57.980
For many years now, they don't have
the sufficient cold weather

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.042
to actually control
the population of this beetle.

00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:08.284
And it became a disease
that is really killing billions of trees.

00:10:08.284 --> 00:10:12.574
So I came back with this notion
that the forest is actually

00:10:12.574 --> 00:10:17.843
one of the earliest and most affected
victims of climate change.

00:10:17.843 --> 00:10:19.503
So I was thinking,

00:10:19.503 --> 00:10:23.967
if I succeed in working
with all my colleagues

00:10:23.967 --> 00:10:26.443
to actually help to stop deforestation,

00:10:26.443 --> 00:10:30.690
maybe we will lose the battle
later on for climate change

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.630
by floods, heat, fires and so on.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.011
So I decided to leave the forest service

00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:41.415
and start to work directly
on climate change,

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:45.463
find a way to think and understand
the challenge, and go from there.

00:10:45.463 --> 00:10:50.051
Now, the challenge of climate change
is pretty straightforward.

00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:51.819
The goal is very clear.

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:55.428
We want to limit the increase
of the average temperature

00:10:55.428 --> 00:10:58.001
of the planet to two degrees.

00:10:58.001 --> 00:10:59.737
There are several reasons for that.

00:10:59.737 --> 00:11:01.984
I will not get into that now.

00:11:01.984 --> 00:11:05.441
But in order to get
to this limit of two degrees,

00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:09.254
which is possible for us to survive,

00:11:09.254 --> 00:11:14.317
the IPCC, the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change,

00:11:14.317 --> 00:11:20.615
defines that we have a budget of emissions
of 1,000 billion tons of CO2

00:11:21.337 --> 00:11:24.579
from now until the end of the century.

00:11:24.579 --> 00:11:27.243
So if we divide this
by the number of years,

00:11:27.243 --> 00:11:33.910
what we have is an average budget
of 11 billion tons of CO2 per year.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.118
Now what is one ton of CO2?

00:11:36.118 --> 00:11:42.107
It's more or less what one small car,
running 20 kilometers a day,

00:11:42.107 --> 00:11:44.644
will emit in one year.

00:11:44.644 --> 00:11:46.705
Or it's one flight, one way,

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:50.089
from São Paulo to Johannesburg
or to London, one way.

00:11:50.089 --> 00:11:51.928
Two ways, two tons.

00:11:51.928 --> 00:11:55.402
So 11 billion tons is twice that.

00:11:55.402 --> 00:12:02.467
Now the emissions today
are 50 billion tons, and it's growing.

00:12:02.467 --> 00:12:06.895
It's growing and maybe
it will be 61 by 2020.

00:12:06.895 --> 00:12:11.592
Now we need to go down to 10 by 2050.

00:12:11.592 --> 00:12:13.367
And while this happens,

00:12:13.367 --> 00:12:16.514
the population will grow
from seven to nine billion people,

00:12:16.514 --> 00:12:19.412
the economy will grow
from 60 trillion dollars in 2010

00:12:19.412 --> 00:12:21.474
to 200 trillion dollars.

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:25.484
And so what we need to do
is to be much more efficient

00:12:25.484 --> 00:12:30.425
in a way that we can go
from seven tons of carbon per capita

00:12:30.425 --> 00:12:35.307
per person, per year,
into something like one.

00:12:35.307 --> 00:12:39.127
You have to choose.
You take the airplane or you have a car.

00:12:40.338 --> 00:12:42.986
So the question is, can we make it?

00:12:42.986 --> 00:12:44.903
And that's the exactly the same question

00:12:44.903 --> 00:12:49.048
I got when I was developing
a plan to combat deforestation.

00:12:49.048 --> 00:12:52.672
It's such a big problem, so complex.
Can we really do it?

00:12:53.677 --> 00:12:56.366
I think so. Think of this:

00:12:56.366 --> 00:13:01.677
Deforestation means 60 percent
of the greenhouse gas emissions

00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:03.516
in Brazil in the last decade.

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:05.587
Now it's a little bit
less than 30 percent.

00:13:05.587 --> 00:13:09.487
In the world, 60 percent is energy.

00:13:09.487 --> 00:13:13.026
So if we can tackle directly the energy,

00:13:13.026 --> 00:13:15.714
the same way we could
tackle deforestation,

00:13:15.714 --> 00:13:17.890
maybe we can have a chance.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.547
So there are five things
that I think we should do.

00:13:21.547 --> 00:13:25.893
First, we need to disconnect development
from carbon emissions.

00:13:25.893 --> 00:13:31.982
We don't need to clear-cut all the forests
to actually get more jobs

00:13:31.982 --> 00:13:33.795
and agriculture and have more economy.

00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:36.297
That's what we proved
when we decreased deforestation

00:13:36.297 --> 00:13:38.113
and the economy continued to grow.

00:13:38.113 --> 00:13:42.510
Same thing could happen
in the energy sector.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.793
Second, we have to move
the incentives to the right place.

00:13:45.793 --> 00:13:51.050
Today, 500 billion dollars a year
goes into subsidies for fossil fuels.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:56.204
Why don't we put a price on carbon
and transfer this to the renewable energy?

00:13:56.204 --> 00:13:59.638
Third, we need to measure
and make it transparent

00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:02.932
where, when and who
is emitting greenhouse gases

00:14:02.932 --> 00:14:07.128
so we can have actions specifically
for each one of those opportunities.

00:14:07.128 --> 00:14:11.914
Fourth, we need to leapfrog
the routes of development,

00:14:11.914 --> 00:14:14.710
which means, you don't need
to go to the landline telephone

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.044
before you get to the mobile phones.

00:14:17.044 --> 00:14:19.182
Same way we don't need
to go to fossil fuels

00:14:19.182 --> 00:14:21.890
to the one billion people
who don't have access to energy

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.084
before we get to the clean energy.

00:14:24.084 --> 00:14:25.970
And fifth and last,

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.668
we need to share responsibility
between governments,

00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:31.390
business and civil society.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:35.225
There is work to do for everybody,
and we need to have everybody on board.

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:37.651
So to finalize,

00:14:37.651 --> 00:14:41.371
I think the future is not like a fate

00:14:41.371 --> 00:14:44.109
that you have to just go
as business as usual goes.

00:14:44.109 --> 00:14:47.911
We need to have the courage
to actually change the route,

00:14:47.911 --> 00:14:49.314
invest in something new,

00:14:49.314 --> 00:14:52.432
think that we can actually
change the route.

00:14:52.432 --> 00:14:55.454
I think we are doing this
with deforestation in Brazil,

00:14:55.454 --> 00:14:58.585
and I hope we can do it also
with climate change in the world.

00:14:58.585 --> 00:14:59.691
Thank you.

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:03.059
(Applause)
