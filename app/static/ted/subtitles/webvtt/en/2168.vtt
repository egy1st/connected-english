00:00:00.742 --> 00:00:07.963
So we humans have an extraordinary
potential for goodness,

00:00:07.963 --> 00:00:12.363
but also an immense power to do harm.

00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:18.029
Any tool can be used to build
or to destroy.

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:21.217
That all depends on our motivation.

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:24.664
Therefore, it is all the more important

00:00:24.664 --> 00:00:28.938
to foster an altruistic motivation
rather than a selfish one.

00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:37.008
So now we indeed are facing 
many challenges in our times.

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.325
Those could be personal challenges.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:44.911
Our own mind can be our best friend
or our worst enemy.

00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:49.225
There's also societal challenges:

00:00:49.225 --> 00:00:54.924
poverty in the midst of plenty,
inequalities, conflict, injustice.

00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:59.120
And then there are the new challenges,
which we don't expect.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.763
Ten thousand years ago, there were
about five million human beings on Earth.

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.373
Whatever they could do,

00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:10.559
the Earth's resilience 
would soon heal human activities.

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:13.775
After the Industrial
and Technological Revolutions,

00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:16.008
that's not the same anymore.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:20.073
We are now the major agent
of impact on our Earth.

00:01:20.073 --> 00:01:24.977
We enter the Anthropocene,
the era of human beings.

00:01:24.977 --> 00:01:31.970
So in a way, if we were to say
we need to continue this endless growth,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.616
endless use of material resources,

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:38.514
it's like if this man was saying --

00:01:38.514 --> 00:01:43.386
and I heard a former head of state,
I won't mention who, saying --

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:47.395
"Five years ago, we were at
the edge of the precipice.

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:49.972
Today we made a big step forward."

00:01:50.587 --> 00:01:56.590
So this edge is the same
that has been defined by scientists

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.244
as the planetary boundaries.

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:03.705
And within those boundaries,
they can carry a number of factors.

00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:09.231
We can still prosper, humanity can still
prosper for 150,000 years

00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:12.563
if we keep the same stability of climate

00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:15.721
as in the Holocene
for the last 10,000 years.

00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:21.479
But this depends on choosing
a voluntary simplicity,

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.160
growing qualitatively, not quantitatively.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.394
So in 1900, as you can see,
we were well within the limits of safety.

00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:35.793
Now, in 1950 came the great acceleration.

00:02:35.793 --> 00:02:40.762
Now hold your breath, not too long,
to imagine what comes next.

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:46.907
Now we have vastly overrun
some of the planetary boundaries.

00:02:46.907 --> 00:02:50.866
Just to take biodiversity, 
at the current rate,

00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:57.288
by 2050, 30 percent of all species 
on Earth will have disappeared.

00:02:57.288 --> 00:03:03.085
Even if we keep their DNA in some fridge,
that's not going to be reversible.

00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:04.936
So here I am sitting

00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:10.836
in front of a 7,000-meter-high, 
21,000-foot glacier in Bhutan.

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:17.987
At the Third Pole, 2,000 glaciers
are melting fast, faster than the Arctic.

00:03:17.987 --> 00:03:20.994
So what can we do in that situation?

00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:29.453
Well, however complex
politically, economically, scientifically

00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:31.851
the question of the environment is,

00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:38.678
it simply boils down to a question
of altruism versus selfishness.

00:03:38.678 --> 00:03:42.287
I'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency.

00:03:42.287 --> 00:03:43.712
(Laughter)

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:47.121
Groucho Marx said, "Why should I care
about future generations?

00:03:47.121 --> 00:03:49.151
What have they ever done for me?"

00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:50.647
(Laughter)

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:55.430
Unfortunately, I heard
the billionaire Steve Forbes,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.958
on Fox News, saying exactly 
the same thing, but seriously.

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.293
He was told about the rise of the ocean,

00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:04.640
and he said, "I find it absurd
to change my behavior today

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.695
for something that will happen 
in a hundred years."

00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:10.593
So if you don't care
for future generations,

00:04:10.593 --> 00:04:13.494
just go for it.

00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:16.420
So one of the main challenges of our times

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.538
is to reconcile three time scales:

00:04:19.538 --> 00:04:21.683
the short term of the economy,

00:04:21.683 --> 00:04:25.915
the ups and downs of the stock market,
the end-of-the-year accounts;

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:28.621
the midterm of the quality of life --

00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:33.945
what is the quality every moment of our 
life, over 10 years and 20 years? --

00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:37.554
and the long term of the environment.

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:39.903
When the environmentalists
speak with economists,

00:04:39.903 --> 00:04:42.982
it's like a schizophrenic dialogue,
completely incoherent.

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:45.814
They don't speak the same language.

00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:49.354
Now, for the last 10 years,
I went around the world

00:04:49.354 --> 00:04:53.452
meeting economists, scientists,
neuroscientists, environmentalists,

00:04:53.452 --> 00:04:57.912
philosophers, thinkers 
in the Himalayas, all over the place.

00:04:57.912 --> 00:05:01.834
It seems to me, there's only one concept

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:04.794
that can reconcile
those three time scales.

00:05:04.794 --> 00:05:09.198
It is simply having more
consideration for others.

00:05:09.198 --> 00:05:14.099
If you have more consideration for others,
you will have a caring economics,

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.051
where finance is at the service of society

00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:20.319
and not society at the service of finance.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.187
You will not play at the casino

00:05:22.187 --> 00:05:25.073
with the resources that people
have entrusted you with.

00:05:25.073 --> 00:05:27.919
If you have more consideration for others,

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.396
you will make sure
that you remedy inequality,

00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:35.136
that you bring some kind 
of well-being within society,

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:37.176
in education, at the workplace.

00:05:37.176 --> 00:05:40.599
Otherwise, a nation that is
the most powerful and the richest

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.686
but everyone is miserable,
what's the point?

00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:45.973
And if you have more
consideration for others,

00:05:45.973 --> 00:05:49.369
you are not going to ransack
that planet that we have

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:53.703
and at the current rate, we don't
have three planets to continue that way.

00:05:53.703 --> 00:05:56.056
So the question is,

00:05:56.056 --> 00:06:00.387
okay, altruism is the answer,
it's not just a novel ideal,

00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:03.611
but can it be a real, pragmatic solution?

00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:06.469
And first of all, does it exist,

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:10.213
true altruism, or are we so selfish?

00:06:10.213 --> 00:06:15.553
So some philosophers thought
we were irredeemably selfish.

00:06:15.553 --> 00:06:20.765
But are we really all just like rascals?

00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:23.579
That's good news, isn't it?

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:26.108
Many philosophers, 
like Hobbes, have said so.

00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:29.429
But not everyone looks like a rascal.

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:32.262
Or is man a wolf for man?

00:06:32.262 --> 00:06:35.150
But this guy doesn't seem too bad.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.073
He's one of my friends in Tibet.

00:06:38.073 --> 00:06:40.312
He's very kind.

00:06:40.312 --> 00:06:43.937
So now, we love cooperation.

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:48.275
There's no better joy 
than working together, is there?

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:52.350
And then not only humans.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.837
Then, of course, there's
the struggle for life,

00:06:54.837 --> 00:06:59.178
the survival of the fittest,
social Darwinism.

00:06:59.178 --> 00:07:05.015
But in evolution, cooperation --
though competition exists, of course --

00:07:05.015 --> 00:07:10.732
cooperation has to be much more creative
to go to increased levels of complexity.

00:07:10.732 --> 00:07:15.414
We are super-cooperators 
and we should even go further.

00:07:15.414 --> 00:07:21.443
So now, on top of that,
the quality of human relationships.

00:07:21.443 --> 00:07:25.925
The OECD did a survey among 10 factors,
including income, everything.

00:07:25.925 --> 00:07:29.268
The first one that people said,
that's the main thing for my happiness,

00:07:29.268 --> 00:07:32.621
is quality of social relationships.

00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:35.498
Not only in humans.

00:07:35.498 --> 00:07:38.844
And look at those great-grandmothers.

00:07:38.846 --> 00:07:44.000
So now, this idea 
that if we go deep within,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.570
we are irredeemably selfish,

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.224
this is armchair science.

00:07:49.224 --> 00:07:51.491
There is not a single sociological study,

00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:54.737
psychological study,
that's ever shown that.

00:07:54.737 --> 00:07:56.697
Rather, the opposite.

00:07:56.697 --> 00:08:00.355
My friend, Daniel Batson, 
spent a whole life

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:03.118
putting people in the lab
in very complex situations.

00:08:03.118 --> 00:08:07.487
And of course we are sometimes selfish,
and some people more than others.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:10.149
But he found that systematically,
no matter what,

00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:13.149
there's a significant number of people

00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:16.504
who do behave altruistically,
no matter what.

00:08:16.504 --> 00:08:19.696
If you see someone
deeply wounded, great suffering,

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:22.318
you might just help
out of empathic distress --

00:08:22.318 --> 00:08:26.468
you can't stand it, so it's better to help
than to keep on looking at that person.

00:08:26.468 --> 00:08:32.344
So we tested all that, and in the end, 
he said, clearly people can be altruistic.

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:34.284
So that's good news.

00:08:34.284 --> 00:08:39.896
And even further, we should look
at the banality of goodness.

00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:41.600
Now look at here.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.370
When we come out, we aren't 
going to say, "That's so nice.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.937
There was no fistfight while this mob 
was thinking about altruism."

00:08:48.937 --> 00:08:51.099
No, that's expected, isn't it?

00:08:51.099 --> 00:08:54.278
If there was a fistfight,
we would speak of that for months.

00:08:54.278 --> 00:08:57.949
So the banality of goodness is something
that doesn't attract your attention,

00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:59.437
but it exists.

00:08:59.437 --> 00:09:04.913
Now, look at this.

00:09:09.253 --> 00:09:12.054
So some psychologists said,

00:09:12.054 --> 00:09:15.291
when I tell them I run 140 humanitarian 
projects in the Himalayas

00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:17.545
that give me so much joy,

00:09:17.545 --> 00:09:20.799
they said, "Oh, I see,
you work for the warm glow.

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:23.703
That is not altruistic.
You just feel good."

00:09:23.703 --> 00:09:26.991
You think this guy,
when he jumped in front of the train,

00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:29.277
he thought, "I'm going to feel
so good when this is over?"

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.563
(Laughter)

00:09:31.563 --> 00:09:33.849
But that's not the end of it.

00:09:33.849 --> 00:09:36.391
They say, well, but when
you interviewed him, he said,

00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:39.526
"I had no choice.
I had to jump, of course."

00:09:39.526 --> 00:09:43.407
He has no choice. Automatic behavior.
It's neither selfish nor altruistic.

00:09:43.407 --> 00:09:44.882
No choice?

00:09:44.882 --> 00:09:47.844
Well of course, this guy's
not going to think for half an hour,

00:09:47.844 --> 00:09:49.881
"Should I give my hand? Not give my hand?"

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:53.676
He does it. There is a choice,
but it's obvious, it's immediate.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:56.037
And then, also, there he had a choice.

00:09:56.037 --> 00:09:58.738
(Laughter)

00:09:58.738 --> 00:10:02.500
There are people who had choice,
like Pastor André Trocmé and his wife,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.187
and the whole village
of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in France.

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:09.135
For the whole Second World War,
they saved 3,500 Jews,

00:10:09.135 --> 00:10:11.792
gave them shelter,
brought them to Switzerland,

00:10:11.792 --> 00:10:15.237
against all odds, at the risk
of their lives and those of their family.

00:10:15.237 --> 00:10:17.394
So altruism does exist.

00:10:17.394 --> 00:10:19.119
So what is altruism?

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:23.021
It is the wish: May others be happy
and find the cause of happiness.

00:10:23.021 --> 00:10:28.266
Now, empathy is the affective resonance
or cognitive resonance that tells you,

00:10:28.266 --> 00:10:30.977
this person is joyful,
this person suffers.

00:10:30.977 --> 00:10:34.463
But empathy alone is not sufficient.

00:10:34.463 --> 00:10:36.686
If you keep on being
confronted with suffering,

00:10:36.686 --> 00:10:39.447
you might have empathic distress, burnout,

00:10:39.447 --> 00:10:43.507
so you need the greater sphere
of loving-kindness.

00:10:43.507 --> 00:10:46.234
With Tania Singer at the Max Planck 
Institute of Leipzig,

00:10:46.234 --> 00:10:52.335
we showed that the brain networks for
empathy and loving-kindness are different.

00:10:52.335 --> 00:10:54.416
Now, that's all well done,

00:10:54.416 --> 00:10:59.790
so we got that from evolution,
from maternal care, parental love,

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.625
but we need to extend that.

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:04.968
It can be extended even to other species.

00:11:04.968 --> 00:11:09.375
Now, if we want a more altruistic society,
we need two things:

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:12.592
individual change and societal change.

00:11:12.592 --> 00:11:15.150
So is individual change possible?

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.349
Two thousand years
of contemplative study said yes, it is.

00:11:18.349 --> 00:11:21.951
Now, 15 years of collaboration
with neuroscience and epigenetics

00:11:21.951 --> 00:11:26.435
said yes, our brains change
when you train in altruism.

00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:30.707
So I spent 120 hours in an MRI machine.

00:11:30.707 --> 00:11:33.493
This is the first time I went
after two and a half hours.

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:37.167
And then the result has been published
in many scientific papers.

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:40.749
It shows without ambiguity
that there is structural change

00:11:40.749 --> 00:11:44.502
and functional change in the brain
when you train the altruistic love.

00:11:44.502 --> 00:11:46.252
Just to give you an idea:

00:11:46.252 --> 00:11:49.073
this is the meditator at rest on the left,

00:11:49.073 --> 00:11:52.776
meditator in compassion meditation,
you see all the activity,

00:11:52.776 --> 00:11:55.330
and then the control group at rest,
nothing happened,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.272
in meditation, nothing happened.

00:11:57.272 --> 00:11:59.250
They have not been trained.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.671
So do you need 50,000 hours 
of meditation? No, you don't.

00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:07.837
Four weeks, 20 minutes a day,
of caring, mindfulness meditation

00:12:07.838 --> 00:12:14.141
already brings a structural change
in the brain compared to a control group.

00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:17.879
That's only 20 minutes a day
for four weeks.

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:21.217
Even with preschoolers --
Richard Davidson did that in Madison.

00:12:21.217 --> 00:12:27.627
An eight-week program: gratitude, loving-
kindness, cooperation, mindful breathing.

00:12:27.627 --> 00:12:29.882
You would say, 
"Oh, they're just preschoolers."

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:31.508
Look after eight weeks,

00:12:31.508 --> 00:12:33.958
the pro-social behavior,
that's the blue line.

00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:39.402
And then comes the ultimate
scientific test, the stickers test.

00:12:39.402 --> 00:12:43.350
Before, you determine for each child
who is their best friend in the class,

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.425
their least favorite child,
an unknown child, and the sick child,

00:12:47.425 --> 00:12:50.129
and they have to give stickers away.

00:12:50.129 --> 00:12:54.181
So before the intervention,
they give most of it to their best friend.

00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:57.640
Four, five years old, 
20 minutes three times a week.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.123
After the intervention,
no more discrimination:

00:13:01.123 --> 00:13:05.048
the same amount of stickers to their 
best friend and the least favorite child.

00:13:05.048 --> 00:13:08.436
That's something we should do
in all the schools in the world.

00:13:08.436 --> 00:13:10.430
Now where do we go from there?

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.678
(Applause)

00:13:14.678 --> 00:13:17.359
When the Dalai Lama heard that,
he told Richard Davidson,

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:20.815
"You go to 10 schools, 100 schools,
the U.N., the whole world."

00:13:20.815 --> 00:13:22.499
So now where do we go from there?

00:13:22.499 --> 00:13:24.762
Individual change is possible.

00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:29.378
Now do we have to wait for an altruistic 
gene to be in the human race?

00:13:29.378 --> 00:13:33.132
That will take 50,000 years,
too much for the environment.

00:13:33.132 --> 00:13:37.567
Fortunately, there is
the evolution of culture.

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:43.301
Cultures, as specialists have shown,
change faster than genes.

00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:44.829
That's the good news.

00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:48.189
Look, attitude towards war
has dramatically changed over the years.

00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:53.370
So now individual change and cultural 
change mutually fashion each other,

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.146
and yes, we can achieve
a more altruistic society.

00:13:56.146 --> 00:13:57.888
So where do we go from there?

00:13:57.888 --> 00:14:00.137
Myself, I will go back to the East.

00:14:00.137 --> 00:14:03.597
Now we treat 100,000 patients
a year in our projects.

00:14:03.597 --> 00:14:07.346
We have 25,000 kids in school,
four percent overhead.

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:09.921
Some people say, "Well,
your stuff works in practice,

00:14:09.921 --> 00:14:11.945
but does it work in theory?"

00:14:11.945 --> 00:14:15.287
There's always positive deviance.

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:17.706
So I will also go back to my hermitage

00:14:17.706 --> 00:14:20.995
to find the inner resources
to better serve others.

00:14:20.995 --> 00:14:24.182
But on the more global level,
what can we do?

00:14:24.182 --> 00:14:25.973
We need three things.

00:14:25.973 --> 00:14:28.325
Enhancing cooperation:

00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:32.041
Cooperative learning in the school
instead of competitive learning,

00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:35.612
Unconditional cooperation
within corporations --

00:14:35.612 --> 00:14:40.019
there can be some competition
between corporations, but not within.

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:43.971
We need sustainable harmony.
I love this term.

00:14:43.971 --> 00:14:45.914
Not sustainable growth anymore.

00:14:45.914 --> 00:14:49.500
Sustainable harmony means now
we will reduce inequality.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.826
In the future, we do more with less,

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:58.310
and we continue to grow qualitatively,
not quantitatively.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.615
We need caring economics.

00:15:00.615 --> 00:15:06.446
The Homo economicus cannot deal
with poverty in the midst of plenty,

00:15:06.446 --> 00:15:08.798
cannot deal with the problem
of the common goods

00:15:08.798 --> 00:15:11.096
of the atmosphere, of the oceans.

00:15:11.096 --> 00:15:12.679
We need a caring economics.

00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:14.788
If you say economics
should be compassionate,

00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:16.273
they say, "That's not our job."

00:15:16.273 --> 00:15:19.588
But if you say they don't care,
that looks bad.

00:15:19.588 --> 00:15:22.967
We need local commitment,
global responsibility.

00:15:22.967 --> 00:15:28.307
We need to extend altruism
to the other 1.6 million species.

00:15:28.307 --> 00:15:31.732
Sentient beings 
are co-citizens in this world.

00:15:31.732 --> 00:15:34.724
and we need to dare altruism.

00:15:34.724 --> 00:15:38.605
So, long live the altruistic revolution.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:43.155
Viva la revolución de altruismo.

00:15:43.155 --> 00:15:48.515
(Applause)

00:15:48.515 --> 00:15:50.496
Thank you.

00:15:50.496 --> 00:15:52.448
(Applause)
