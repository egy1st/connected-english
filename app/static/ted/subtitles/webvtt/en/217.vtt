00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I began "The Vagina Monologues" because I was worried about vaginas.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm very worried today about this notion, this world,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
this prevailing kind of force of security.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Real security, security checks, security watch, security clearance.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What does anyone mean when they talk about real security?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And why have we, as Americans particularly,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
become a nation that strives for security above all else?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
In fact, I think that security is elusive. It's impossible.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
People change us. Nothing is secure.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And that's actually the good news.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This is, of course, unless your whole life is about being secure.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I think that when that is the focus of your life,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
these are the things that happen.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
as they might confuse you or challenge you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You can't open yourself to new experiences, new people,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You can't not know who you are, so you cling to hard-matter identity.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You become a Christian, Muslim, Jew.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You're a heterosexual or a homosexual, or you never have sex.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Or at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You become part of an "us."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In order to be secure, you defend against "them."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You cling to your land because it is your secure place.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You become your nation. You become your religion.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and protect you from doubt or change.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But all this does, actually, is shut down your mind.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
In reality, it does not really make you safer.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I was in Sri Lanka, for example, three days after the tsunami,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and I was standing on the beaches

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and it was absolutely clear that, in a matter of five minutes,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
a 30-foot wave could rise up

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and desecrate a people, a population and lives.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
All this striving for security, in fact,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
has made you much more insecure

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
because now you have to watch out all the time.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
There are people not like you -- people who you now call enemies.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
worlds that you can no longer inhabit.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Your days become devoted to protecting yourself.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This becomes your mission. That is all you do.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
There are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
There are those who, if they're not with us, are against us.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
occupy them, invade them and kill them,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
because they are only obstacles now to your security.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
In six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
a global movement against [violence against] women,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to travel probably to 60 countries,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and spend a great deal of time in different portions.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I've met women and men all over this planet,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
who through various circumstances --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
war, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
have never known security,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
or have had their illusion of security forever devastated.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
who were essentially brutalized and censored.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I've been in Bosnian refugee camps.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I was with women in Pakistan

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
who have had their faces melted off with acid.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I've been with girls all across America who were date-raped,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
is that there is this emerging species.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
we call Vagina Warriors.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
These particular people, rather than getting AK-47s,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
or weapons of mass destruction, or machetes,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They have grieved it, they have died into it,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
towards another mission and another trajectory.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
These warriors now devote themselves and their lives

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I venture there are many in this room.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
They have a fierceness and a freedom

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Their own personal security is not their end goal,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and because of that, because, rather than worrying about security,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
because the transformation of suffering is their end goal,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I actually believe they are creating real safety

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and a whole new idea of security.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Tomorrow, I am going to Cairo,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
who are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
for battered women in the Middle East.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and put themselves on the line,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and were willing to be attacked and criticized.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And through their work over the last years,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
this is not only happening that this house is opening,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
but it's being supported by many factions of the society

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
who never would have supported it.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Women in Uganda this year,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
who put on "The Vagina Monologues" during V-Day,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
actually evoked the wrath of the government.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And, I love this story so much.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to talk about whether "Vaginas" could come to Uganda.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And in this meeting -- it went on for weeks in the press,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
two weeks where there was huge discussion.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
The government finally made a decision

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that "The Vagina Monologues" could not be performed in Uganda.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
But the amazing news was that because they had stood up, these women,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and because they had been willing to risk their security,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
but all of Africa.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
As a result, this production, which had already sold out,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
every single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
made a decision to keep the money.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
They raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
She's a high school student.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
She had seen "The Vagina Monologues" and she was really moved. And as a result,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
she wore an "I heart my vagina" button to her high school in Minnesota.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
(Laughter)

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
She was basically threatened to be expelled from school.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
that it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that it was not a good thing.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So she really struggled with this, what to do,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together --

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I believe it was 100, 150 students

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
all wore "I love my vagina" T-shirts,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and the boys wore "I love her vagina" T-shirts to school.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
(Laughter)

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Now this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
but what happened as a result of that, is that that school now

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
or to say that she loved her vagina publicly.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I know I've talked about Agnes here before,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
but I want to give you an update on Agnes.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
When she was a young girl, she had been mutilated against her will.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
That mutilation of her clitoris

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
had actually obviously impacted her life

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and changed it in a way that was devastating.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
For eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
torso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and she would teach people, everywhere she went,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
In the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
She saved 1,500 girls from being cut.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
When V-Day met her, we asked her how we could support her

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I could get around a lot faster." So, we bought her a Jeep.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
In the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So, we said, what else could we do?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
She said, "If you help me get money, I could open a house."

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Three years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
When she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
she was detested, she was completely slandered in her community.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I am proud to tell you that six months ago,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
(Applause)

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
I think what I'm trying to say here

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
is that if your end goal is security,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
is that you create not only more insecurity in other people,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
but you make yourself far more insecure.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Real security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Not running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Real security is not knowing something, when you don't know it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Real security is hungering for connection rather than power.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
It is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
that we are all utterly inter-bended,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and one action by one being in one tiny town

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
has consequences everywhere.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Real security is not only being able

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
to tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and only trusting a situation when they are present.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Something happened when I began traveling in V-Day, eight years ago. I got lost.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and I had no idea where I was.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
where I was going, or where I had come from

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
because we are all essentially permanently displaced people.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
All of us are refugees.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
moving towards a new place.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Freedom means I may not be identified as any one group,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
but that I can visit and find myself in every group.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
It does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
but it does mean I am not hardened around them.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I do not use them as weapons.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
In the shared future, it will be just that, shared.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
The end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
realizing the place of our connection to one another,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
rather than becoming secure, in control and alone.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Thank you very much.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
(Applause)

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Chris Anderson: And how are you doing? Are you exhausted?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
On a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Eve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
that in order to survive the twentieth century,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
we have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And I think part of what I'm learning in this process

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
is that one must allow oneself to feel grief.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and then moving on, I'm fine.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
country to country, and city to city,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
the degree to which women, for example, are violated,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
or I have to take the time now, to process that.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
CA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
you know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Why this one?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
EE: I think that if you think about women,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
we come from them, they are mothers, they are visionaries,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
they are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
that one out of three women on the planet

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
will be raped or beaten in their lifetime,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
we're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
How does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
or thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.
