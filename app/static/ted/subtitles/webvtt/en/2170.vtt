WEBVTT

00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:04.209
My students and I
work on very tiny robots.

00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:06.426
Now, you can think of these
as robotic versions

00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:10.016
of something that you're all
very familiar with: an ant.

00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:12.776
We all know that ants
and other insects at this size scale

00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:15.012
can do some pretty incredible things.

00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:18.197
We've all seen a group of ants,
or some version of that,

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:22.467
carting off your potato chip
at a picnic, for example.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.910
But what are the real challenges
of engineering these ants?

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.861
Well, first of all, how do we get
the capabilities of an ant

00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:31.909
in a robot at the same size scale?

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.513
Well, first we need to figure out
how to make them move

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:35.923
when they're so small.

00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:38.223
We need mechanisms like legs
and efficient motors

00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:40.072
in order to support that locomotion,

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:42.563
and we need the sensors,
power and control

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.525
in order to pull everything together
in a semi-intelligent ant robot.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:49.071
And finally, to make
these things really functional,

00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:53.019
we want a lot of them working together
in order to do bigger things.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.710
So I'll start with mobility.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.871
Insects move around amazingly well.

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:00.559
This video is from UC Berkeley.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.342
It shows a cockroach moving
over incredibly rough terrain

00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:05.195
without tipping over,

00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:09.192
and it's able to do this because its legs
are a combination of rigid materials,

00:01:09.192 --> 00:01:11.545
which is what we traditionally
use to make robots,

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:13.144
and soft materials.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:18.201
Jumping is another really interesting way
to get around when you're very small.

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:22.270
So these insects store energy in a spring
and release that really quickly

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.281
to get the high power they need
to jump out of water, for example.

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:29.403
So one of the big
contributions from my lab

00:01:29.403 --> 00:01:32.153
has been to combine
rigid and soft materials

00:01:32.153 --> 00:01:34.367
in very, very small mechanisms.

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:37.532
So this jumping mechanism
is about four millimeters on a side,

00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:39.220
so really tiny.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.058
The hard material here is silicon,
and the soft material is silicone rubber.

00:01:43.058 --> 00:01:45.953
And the basic idea is that
we're going to compress this,

00:01:45.953 --> 00:01:48.654
store energy in the springs,
and then release it to jump.

00:01:48.654 --> 00:01:52.037
So there's no motors
on board this right now, no power.

00:01:52.037 --> 00:01:54.800
This is actuated with a method
that we call in my lab

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.472
"graduate student with tweezers."
(Laughter)

00:01:57.472 --> 00:01:59.306
So what you'll see in the next video

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:02.333
is this guy doing
amazingly well for its jumps.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:05.947
So this is Aaron, the graduate student
in question, with the tweezers,

00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:08.630
and what you see is this 
four-millimeter-sized mechanism

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.841
jumping almost 40 centimeters high.

00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:13.265
That's almost 100 times its own length.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.221
And it survives, bounces on the table,

00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:18.735
it's incredibly robust, and of course
survives quite well until we lose it

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:21.361
because it's very tiny.

00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:23.970
Ultimately, though, we want
to add motors to this too,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.086
and we have students in the lab
working on millimeter-sized motors

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:30.686
to eventually integrate onto
small, autonomous robots.

00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:34.267
But in order to look at mobility and
locomotion at this size scale to start,

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:36.241
we're cheating and using magnets.

00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:39.317
So this shows what would eventually
be part of a micro-robot leg,

00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:41.334
and you can see the silicone rubber joints

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:43.963
and there's an embedded magnet
that's being moved around

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:46.266
by an external magnetic field.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.949
So this leads to the robot
that I showed you earlier.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.110
The really interesting thing
that this robot can help us figure out

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.117
is how insects move at this scale.

00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:57.342
We have a really good model
for how everything

00:02:57.342 --> 00:02:59.304
from a cockroach up to an elephant moves.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.228
We all move in this 
kind of bouncy way when we run.

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:06.513
But when I'm really small, 
the forces between my feet and the ground

00:03:06.513 --> 00:03:09.288
are going to affect my locomotion
a lot more than my mass,

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:11.642
which is what causes that bouncy motion.

00:03:11.642 --> 00:03:13.317
So this guy doesn't work quite yet,

00:03:13.317 --> 00:03:16.392
but we do have slightly larger versions
that do run around.

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:20.277
So this is about a centimeter cubed,
a centimeter on a side, so very tiny,

00:03:20.277 --> 00:03:23.179
and we've gotten this to run
about 10 body lengths per second,

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:24.565
so 10 centimeters per second.

00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:26.598
It's pretty quick for a little, small guy,

00:03:26.598 --> 00:03:28.960
and that's really only limited 
by our test setup.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.607
But this gives you some idea
of how it works right now.

00:03:32.027 --> 00:03:35.781
We can also make 3D-printed versions 
of this that can climb over obstacles,

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:39.280
a lot like the cockroach
that you saw earlier.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.166
But ultimately we want to add
everything onboard the robot.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:45.859
We want sensing, power, control,
actuation all together,

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.765
and not everything
needs to be bio-inspired.

00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:51.900
So this robot's about
the size of a Tic Tac.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.849
And in this case, instead of magnets
or muscles to move this around,

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.274
we use rockets.

00:03:58.274 --> 00:04:00.940
So this is a micro-fabricated
energetic material,

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.539
and we can create tiny pixels of this,

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:07.326
and we can put one of these pixels
on the belly of this robot,

00:04:07.326 --> 00:04:11.722
and this robot, then, is going to jump
when it senses an increase in light.

00:04:12.645 --> 00:04:14.618
So the next video is one of my favorites.

00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:17.658
So you have this 300-milligram robot

00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:20.064
jumping about eight
centimeters in the air.

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:22.974
It's only four by four
by seven millimeters in size.

00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:25.130
And you'll see a big flash
at the beginning

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.622
when the energetic is set off,

00:04:26.622 --> 00:04:28.530
and the robot tumbling through the air.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.139
So there was that big flash,

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.336
and you can see the robot
jumping up through the air.

00:04:33.336 --> 00:04:36.368
So there's no tethers on this,
no wires connecting to this.

00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:38.862
Everything is onboard,
and it jumped in response

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:43.243
to the student just flicking on
a desk lamp next to it.

00:04:43.243 --> 00:04:46.897
So I think you can imagine
all the cool things that we could do

00:04:46.897 --> 00:04:51.604
with robots that can run and crawl
and jump and roll at this size scale.

00:04:51.604 --> 00:04:55.394
Imagine the rubble that you get after 
a natural disaster like an earthquake.

00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:57.953
Imagine these small robots
running through that rubble

00:04:57.953 --> 00:05:00.171
to look for survivors.

00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:03.127
Or imagine a lot of small robots
running around a bridge

00:05:03.127 --> 00:05:05.286
in order to inspect it
and make sure it's safe

00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:07.326
so you don't get collapses like this,

00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:11.233
which happened outside of 
Minneapolis in 2007.

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:12.995
Or just imagine what you could do

00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:15.518
if you had robots that could
swim through your blood.

00:05:15.518 --> 00:05:17.851
Right? "Fantastic Voyage," Isaac Asimov.

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:22.206
Or they could operate without having
to cut you open in the first place.

00:05:22.206 --> 00:05:24.936
Or we could radically change
the way we build things

00:05:24.936 --> 00:05:28.343
if we have our tiny robots
work the same way that termites do,

00:05:28.343 --> 00:05:31.108
and they build these incredible
eight-meter-high mounds,

00:05:31.108 --> 00:05:35.196
effectively well ventilated
apartment buildings for other termites

00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:37.287
in Africa and Australia.

00:05:37.287 --> 00:05:39.717
So I think I've given you
some of the possibilities

00:05:39.717 --> 00:05:42.154
of what we can do with these small robots.

00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:46.561
And we've made some advances so far,
but there's still a long way to go,

00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:49.419
and hopefully some of you
can contribute to that destination.

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.187
Thanks very much.

00:05:51.187 --> 00:05:53.391
(Applause)
