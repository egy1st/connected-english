00:00:01.162 --> 00:00:05.704
When I was young,
I prided myself as a nonconformist

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:10.429
in the conservative
U.S. state I live in, Kansas.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.742
I didn't follow along with the crowd.

00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:16.173
I wasn't afraid to try
weird clothing trends or hairstyles.

00:00:16.173 --> 00:00:19.762
I was outspoken and extremely social.

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:26.093
Even these pictures and postcards 
of my London semester abroad 16 years ago

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:32.097
show that I obviously didn't care
if I was perceived as weird or different.

00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:33.581
(Laughter)

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:39.287
But that same year 
I was in London, 16 years ago,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.699
I realized something about myself
that actually was somewhat unique,

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.059
and that changed everything.

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:53.079
I became the opposite
of who I thought I once was.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.005
I stayed in my room
instead of socializing.

00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:00.385
I stopped engaging in clubs
and leadership activities.

00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:04.260
I didn't want to stand out
in the crowd anymore.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.325
I told myself it was because
I was growing up and maturing,

00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:11.559
not that I was suddenly
looking for acceptance.

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:14.580
I had always assumed I was immune
to needing acceptance.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.944
After all, I was a bit unconventional.

00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:19.351
But I realize now

00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:23.516
that the moment I realized
something was different about me

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:29.119
was the exact same moment
that I began conforming and hiding.

00:01:29.728 --> 00:01:32.200
Hiding is a progressive habit,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.948
and once you start hiding,

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:38.953
it becomes harder and harder
to step forward and speak out.

00:01:39.888 --> 00:01:41.822
In fact, even now,

00:01:41.822 --> 00:01:45.697
when I was talking to people
about what this talk was about,

00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:47.533
I made up a cover story

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:51.348
and I even hid the truth
about my TED Talk.

00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:57.329
So it is fitting and scary

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.519
that I have returned 
to this city 16 years later

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:06.811
and I have chosen this stage
to finally stop hiding.

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:12.325
What have I been hiding
for 16 years?

00:02:14.205 --> 00:02:17.602
I am a lesbian.

00:02:17.602 --> 00:02:22.835
(Applause)

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:36.038
Thank you.

00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:38.397
I've struggled to say those words,

00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:41.573
because I didn't want
to be defined by them.

00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:44.202
Every time I would think
about coming out in the past,

00:02:44.202 --> 00:02:49.266
I would think to myself,
but I just want to be known as Morgana,

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.430
uniquely Morgana,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.439
but not "my lesbian friend Morgana,"
or "my gay coworker Morgana."

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.893
Just Morgana.

00:02:58.893 --> 00:03:02.302
For those of you from large
metropolitan areas,

00:03:02.302 --> 00:03:04.895
this may not seem like a big deal to you.

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:07.839
It may seem strange 
that I have suppressed the truth

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:11.035
and hidden this for so long.

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:15.726
But I was paralyzed by my fear
of not being accepted.

00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:19.459
And I'm not alone, of course.

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.308
A 2013 Deloitte study found
that a surprisingly large number of people

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:27.078
hide aspects of their identity.

00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:29.949
Of all the employees they surveyed,

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:35.568
61 percent reported changing an aspect
of their behavior or their appearance

00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:37.841
in order to fit in at work.

00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:42.470
Of all the gay, lesbian
and bisexual employees,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.260
83 percent admitted to changing
some aspects of themselves

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.758
so they would not 
appear at work "too gay."

00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:55.340
The study found that even in companies

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.253
with diversity policies
and inclusion programs,

00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:02.006
employees struggle
to be themselves at work

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.989
because they believe 
conformity is critical

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.496
to their long-term career advancement.

00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:13.438
And while I was surprised
that so many people just like me

00:04:13.438 --> 00:04:17.231
waste so much energy
trying to hide themselves,

00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:21.122
I was scared when I discovered
that my silence

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:27.432
has life-or-death consequences
and long-term social repercussions.

00:04:29.117 --> 00:04:31.308
Twelve years:

00:04:31.308 --> 00:04:34.979
the length by which 
life expectancy is shortened

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:41.017
for gay, lesbian and bisexual people
in highly anti-gay communities

00:04:41.017 --> 00:04:43.673
compared to accepting communities.

00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:48.731
Twelve years reduced life expectancy.

00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.429
When I read that in The Advocate 
magazine this year,

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:56.234
I realized I could no longer
afford to keep silent.

00:04:56.904 --> 00:05:02.896
The effects of personal stress and
social stigmas are a deadly combination.

00:05:04.692 --> 00:05:07.963
The study found that gays
in anti-gay communities

00:05:07.963 --> 00:05:13.710
had higher rates of heart disease,
violence and suicide.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.040
What I once thought
was simply a personal matter

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.226
I realized had a ripple effect

00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:21.820
that went into the workplace
and out into the community

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.185
for every story just like mine.

00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:29.005
My choice to hide
and not share who I really am

00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:33.048
may have inadvertently contributed
to this exact same environment

00:05:33.048 --> 00:05:35.492
and atmosphere of discrimination.

00:05:36.192 --> 00:05:41.590
I'd always told myself
there's no reason to share that I was gay,

00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:45.809
but the idea that my silence
has social consequences

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:50.669
was really driven home this year
when I missed an opportunity

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.421
to change the atmosphere of discrimination
in my own home state of Kansas.

00:05:56.421 --> 00:06:01.623
In February, the Kansas House of 
Representatives brought up a bill for vote

00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:04.147
that would have essentially
allowed businesses

00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:10.745
to use religious freedom as a reason
to deny gays services.

00:06:13.063 --> 00:06:16.245
A former coworker and friend of mine

00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:21.068
has a father who serves
in the Kansas House of Representatives.

00:06:21.068 --> 00:06:26.246
He voted in favor of the bill,

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:33.007
in favor of a law that would allow 
businesses to not serve me.

00:06:34.647 --> 00:06:36.436
How does my friend feel

00:06:36.436 --> 00:06:41.922
about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
queer and questioning people?

00:06:41.922 --> 00:06:44.611
How does her father feel?

00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:50.499
I don't know, because I was never honest 
with them about who I am.

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:53.773
And that shakes me to the core.

00:06:53.773 --> 00:06:57.204
What if I had told her my story years ago?

00:06:57.204 --> 00:06:59.853
Could she have told 
her father my experience?

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:04.885
Could I have ultimately
helped change his vote?

00:07:04.885 --> 00:07:07.348
I will never know,

00:07:07.348 --> 00:07:11.480
and that made me realize
I had done nothing

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.723
to try to make a difference.

00:07:15.053 --> 00:07:19.074
How ironic that I work
in human resources,

00:07:19.074 --> 00:07:21.512
a profession that works to welcome,

00:07:21.512 --> 00:07:25.097
connect and encourage
the development of employees,

00:07:25.097 --> 00:07:28.339
a profession that advocates
that the diversity of society

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:31.004
should be reflected in the workplace,

00:07:31.004 --> 00:07:36.779
and yet I have done nothing
to advocate for diversity.

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:39.649
When I came to this company one year ago,

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:44.724
I thought to myself, this company 
has anti-discrimination policies

00:07:44.724 --> 00:07:48.777
that protect gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender people.

00:07:48.777 --> 00:07:54.483
Their commitment to diversity is evident
through their global inclusion programs.

00:07:54.483 --> 00:07:59.645
When I walk through the doors
of this company, I will finally come out.

00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:02.540
But I didn't.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.250
Instead of taking advantage
of the opportunity,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.529
I did nothing.

00:08:19.838 --> 00:08:26.038
(Applause)

00:08:27.737 --> 00:08:31.652
When I was looking through
my London journal and scrapbook

00:08:31.652 --> 00:08:34.902
from my London semester
abroad 16 years ago,

00:08:34.902 --> 00:08:40.396
I came across this modified quote
from Toni Morrison's book, "Paradise."

00:08:41.547 --> 00:08:45.841
"There are more scary things
inside than outside."

00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:49.099
And then I wrote a note
to myself at the bottom:

00:08:49.099 --> 00:08:50.983
"Remember this."

00:08:51.983 --> 00:08:56.685
I'm sure I was trying to encourage myself
to get out and explore London,

00:08:56.685 --> 00:09:03.758
but the message I missed was the need 
to start exploring and embracing myself.

00:09:03.762 --> 00:09:07.465
What I didn't realize
until all these years later

00:09:07.465 --> 00:09:12.371
is that the biggest obstacles
I will ever have to overcome

00:09:12.371 --> 00:09:16.438
are my own fears and insecurities.

00:09:16.438 --> 00:09:23.876
I believe that by facing my fears inside,
I will be able to change reality outside.

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:27.791
I made a choice today

00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:34.333
to reveal a part of myself
that I have hidden for too long.

00:09:34.333 --> 00:09:38.644
I hope that this means
I will never hide again,

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:45.486
and I hope that by coming out today,
I can do something to change the data

00:09:45.492 --> 00:09:51.903
and also to help others who feel different
be more themselves and more fulfilled

00:09:51.903 --> 00:09:56.394
in both their professional
and personal lives.

00:09:56.394 --> 00:09:59.147
Thank you.

00:09:59.147 --> 00:10:05.482
(Applause)
