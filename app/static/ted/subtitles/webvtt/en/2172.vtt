00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:06.966
On June 12, 2014, precisely at 3:33

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:11.106
in a balmy winter afternoon
in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil,

00:00:11.106 --> 00:00:14.632
a typical South American winter afternoon,

00:00:14.632 --> 00:00:17.612
this kid, this young man 
that you see celebrating here

00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:19.131
like he had scored a goal,

00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:25.062
Juliano Pinto, 29 years old,
accomplished a magnificent deed.

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:28.182
Despite being paralyzed

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:33.163
and not having any sensation
from mid-chest to the tip of his toes

00:00:33.163 --> 00:00:37.693
as the result of a car crash six years ago
that killed his brother

00:00:37.693 --> 00:00:45.187
and produced a complete spinal cord lesion
that left Juliano in a wheelchair,

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:50.217
Juliano rose to the occasion,
and on this day did something

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:56.222
that pretty much everybody that saw him 
in the six years deemed impossible.

00:00:57.062 --> 00:01:02.394
Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:08.410
of the 2014 Brazilian 
World Soccer Cup here

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.880
just by thinking.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.697
He could not move his body,

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:17.584
but he could imagine the movements
needed to kick a ball.

00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:20.838
He was an athlete before the lesion.
He's a para-athlete right now.

00:01:20.838 --> 00:01:24.300
He's going to be in the Paralympic Games,
I hope, in a couple years.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.882
But what the spinal cord lesion 
did not rob from Juliano

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:31.883
was his ability to dream.

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:37.933
And dream he did that afternoon,
for a stadium of about 75,000 people

00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:42.424
and an audience of close to a billion
watching on TV.

00:01:42.424 --> 00:01:48.725
And that kick crowned, basically,
30 years of basic research

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:50.972
studying how the brain,

00:01:50.972 --> 00:01:54.699
how this amazing universe
that we have between our ears

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:58.795
that is only comparable to universe
that we have above our head

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:01.561
because it has about 100 billion elements

00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:04.263
talking to each other
through electrical brainstorms,

00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:09.504
what Juliano accomplished
took 30 years to imagine in laboratories

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:12.107
and about 15 years to plan.

00:02:12.107 --> 00:02:16.606
When John Chapin and I,
15 years ago, proposed in a paper

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:21.788
that we would build something
that we called a brain-machine interface,

00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:24.745
meaning connecting a brain to devices

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:28.289
so that animals and humans
could just move these devices,

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.140
no matter how far they are
from their own bodies,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.726
just by imagining what they want to do,

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:37.313
our colleagues told us that
we actually needed professional help,

00:02:37.313 --> 00:02:40.010
of the psychiatry variety.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.452
And despite that,
a Scot and a Brazilian persevered,

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:50.471
because that's how we were raised
in our respective countries,

00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:52.607
and for 12, 15 years,

00:02:52.607 --> 00:02:56.996
we made demonstration after demonstration
suggesting that this was possible.

00:02:56.996 --> 00:02:59.445
And a brain-machine interface
is not rocket science,

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.171
it's just brain research.

00:03:01.171 --> 00:03:04.418
It's nothing but using sensors

00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:07.965
to read the electrical brainstorms
that a brain is producing

00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:09.971
to generate the motor commands

00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.184
that have to be downloaded
to the spinal cord,

00:03:12.184 --> 00:03:14.847
so we projected sensors that can read

00:03:14.847 --> 00:03:18.362
hundreds and now thousands
of these brain cells simultaneously,

00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:21.408
and extract from these electrical signals

00:03:21.408 --> 00:03:24.293
the motor planning
that the brain is generating

00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:27.256
to actually make us move into space.

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:30.942
And by doing that, we converted
these signals into digital commands

00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:35.934
that any mechanical, electronic,
or even a virtual device can understand

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:42.490
so that the subject can imagine
what he, she or it wants to make move,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.941
and the device obeys that brain command.

00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:49.845
By sensorizing these devices
with lots of different types of sensors,

00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:51.630
as you are going to see in a moment,

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.099
we actually sent messages
back to the brain to confirm

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.054
that that voluntary motor will
was being enacted, no matter where --

00:03:59.054 --> 00:04:04.429
next to the subject, next door,
or across the planet.

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:07.670
And as this message gave feedback
back to the brain,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.888
the brain realized its goal:
to make us move.

00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:15.346
So this is just one experiment
that we published a few years ago,

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:17.673
where a monkey, without moving its body,

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:21.777
learned to control the movements
of an avatar arm,

00:04:21.777 --> 00:04:23.823
a virtual arm that doesn't exist.

00:04:23.823 --> 00:04:27.025
What you're listening to
is the sound of the brain of this monkey

00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:31.429
as it explores three different
visually identical spheres

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:33.088
in virtual space.

00:04:33.088 --> 00:04:37.130
And to get a reward,
a drop of orange juice that monkeys love,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.942
this animal has to detect,
select one of these objects

00:04:40.942 --> 00:04:42.703
by touching,

00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:44.355
not by seeing it, by touching it,

00:04:44.355 --> 00:04:47.400
because every time this virtual hand
touches one of the objects,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.483
an electrical pulse goes back
to the brain of the animal

00:04:50.483 --> 00:04:54.876
describing the fine texture
of the surface of this object,

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:58.774
so the animal can judge what is 
the correct object that he has to grab,

00:04:58.774 --> 00:05:04.018
and if he does that, he gets a reward
without moving a muscle.

00:05:04.018 --> 00:05:06.498
The perfect Brazilian lunch:

00:05:06.498 --> 00:05:10.213
not moving a muscle
and getting your orange juice.

00:05:10.213 --> 00:05:13.017
So as we saw this happening,

00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:17.962
we actually came and proposed the idea
that we had published 15 years ago.

00:05:17.962 --> 00:05:19.991
We reenacted this paper.

00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:21.960
We got it out of the drawers,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.887
and we proposed that perhaps we could get
a human being that is paralyzed

00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:30.190
to actually use the brain-machine
interface to regain mobility.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.368
The idea was that if you suffered --

00:05:32.368 --> 00:05:34.641
and that can happen to any one of us.

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:36.653
Let me tell you, it's very sudden.

00:05:36.653 --> 00:05:38.378
It's a millisecond of a collision,

00:05:38.378 --> 00:05:41.840
a car accident that
transforms your life completely.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.697
If you have a complete lesion
of the spinal cord,

00:05:44.697 --> 00:05:48.080
you cannot move because your brainstorms
cannot reach your muscles.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.330
However, your brainstorms
continue to be generated in your head.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.245
Paraplegic, quadriplegic patients
dream about moving every night.

00:05:56.245 --> 00:05:58.397
They have that inside their head.

00:05:58.397 --> 00:06:01.738
The problem is how
to get that code out of it

00:06:01.738 --> 00:06:04.662
and make the movement be created again.

00:06:04.662 --> 00:06:07.883
So what we proposed was,
let's create a new body.

00:06:07.883 --> 00:06:09.619
Let's create a robotic vest.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:14.462
And that's exactly why Juliano could
kick that ball just by thinking,

00:06:14.462 --> 00:06:18.781
because he was wearing
the first brain-controlled robotic vest

00:06:18.781 --> 00:06:22.060
that can be used by paraplegic,
quadriplegic patients to move

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.871
and to regain feedback.

00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:26.768
That was the original idea, 15 years ago.

00:06:26.768 --> 00:06:32.242
What I'm going to show you is how
156 people from 25 countries

00:06:32.242 --> 00:06:35.011
all over the five continents
of this beautiful Earth,

00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:38.029
dropped their lives,
dropped their patents,

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:42.139
dropped their dogs, wives,
kids, school, jobs,

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.656
and congregated to come to Brazil
for 18 months to actually get this done.

00:06:47.656 --> 00:06:51.531
Because a couple years after Brazil
was awarded the World Cup,

00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:55.183
we heard that the Brazilian government
wanted to do something meaningful

00:06:55.183 --> 00:06:56.881
in the opening ceremony

00:06:56.881 --> 00:07:00.621
in the country that reinvented
and perfected soccer

00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:02.827
until we met the Germans, of course.

00:07:02.827 --> 00:07:04.220
(Laughter)

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.055
But that's a different talk,

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:10.095
and a different neuroscientist
needs to talk about that.

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:12.169
But what Brazil wanted to do
is to showcase

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:13.894
a completely different country,

00:07:13.894 --> 00:07:16.782
a country that values science
and technology,

00:07:16.782 --> 00:07:20.665
and can give a gift to millions,
25 million people around the world

00:07:20.665 --> 00:07:23.500
that cannot move any longer
because of a spinal cord injury.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.104
Well, we went to the Brazilian government
and to FIFA and proposed,

00:07:27.104 --> 00:07:30.472
well, let's have the kickoff
of the 2014 World Cup

00:07:30.472 --> 00:07:32.844
be given by a Brazilian paraplegic

00:07:32.844 --> 00:07:37.734
using a brain-controlled exoskeleton
that allows him to kick the ball

00:07:37.734 --> 00:07:40.010
and to feel the contact of the ball.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.624
They looked at us,
thought that we were completely nuts,

00:07:42.624 --> 00:07:45.480
and said, "Okay, let's try."

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.720
We had 18 months to do everything
from zero, from scratch.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.956
We had no exoskeleton, we had no patients,

00:07:52.956 --> 00:07:54.173
we had nothing done.

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:56.509
These people came all together

00:07:56.509 --> 00:08:00.757
and in 18 months, we got eight patients
in a routine of training

00:08:00.757 --> 00:08:04.855
and basically built from nothing this guy,

00:08:04.855 --> 00:08:08.435
that we call Bra-Santos Dumont 1.

00:08:09.315 --> 00:08:12.740
The first brain-controlled
exoskeleton to be built

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.896
was named after the most famous
Brazilian scientist ever,

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.869
Alberto Santos Dumont,

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:24.672
who, on October 19, 1901,
created and flew himself

00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:31.899
the first controlled airship on air
in Paris for a million people to see.

00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:33.918
Sorry, my American friends,

00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:35.228
I live in North Carolina,

00:08:35.228 --> 00:08:40.110
but it was two years
before the Wright Brothers flew

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.274
on the coast of North Carolina.

00:08:42.274 --> 00:08:44.849
(Applause)

00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:50.117
Flight control is Brazilian.
(Laughter)

00:08:50.117 --> 00:08:53.117
So we went together with these guys

00:08:53.117 --> 00:08:56.018
and we basically put
this exoskeleton together,

00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:59.990
15 degrees of freedom,
hydraulic machine

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.707
that can be commanded by brain signals

00:09:02.707 --> 00:09:06.925
recorded by a non-invasive technology
called electroencephalography

00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:10.114
that can basically allow the patient
to imagine the movements

00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:14.065
and send his commands
to the controls, the motors,

00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:15.867
and get it done.

00:09:15.867 --> 00:09:18.730
This exoskeleton was covered
with an artificial skin

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.814
invented by Gordon Cheng,
one of my greatest friends, in Munich,

00:09:22.814 --> 00:09:27.400
to allow sensation from the joints moving
and the foot touching the ground

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.940
to be delivered back to the patient
through a vest, a shirt.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.910
It is a smart shirt
with micro-vibrating elements

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.733
that basically delivers the feedback
and fools the patient's brain

00:09:39.733 --> 00:09:43.204
by creating a sensation that it is not
a machine that is carrying him,

00:09:43.204 --> 00:09:46.454
but it is he who is walking again.

00:09:46.454 --> 00:09:49.313
So we got this going,
and what you'll see here

00:09:49.313 --> 00:09:54.003
is the first time one of our patients,
Bruno, actually walked.

00:09:54.003 --> 00:09:56.881
And he takes a few seconds
because we are setting everything,

00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:00.178
and you are going to see a blue light
cutting in front of the helmet

00:10:00.178 --> 00:10:04.098
because Bruno is going to imagine
the movement that needs to be performed,

00:10:04.098 --> 00:10:07.306
the computer is going to analyze it,
Bruno is going to certify it,

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:09.115
and when it is certified,

00:10:09.115 --> 00:10:12.642
the device starts moving
under the command of Bruno's brain.

00:10:12.642 --> 00:10:17.217
And he just got it right,
and now he starts walking.

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:20.003
After nine years without
being able to move,

00:10:20.003 --> 00:10:22.673
he is walking by himself.

00:10:22.673 --> 00:10:24.275
And more than that --

00:10:24.275 --> 00:10:27.503
(Applause) --

00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:29.290
more than just walking,

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.608
he is feeling the ground,

00:10:31.608 --> 00:10:33.651
and if the speed of the exo goes up,

00:10:33.651 --> 00:10:38.102
he tells us that he is walking again
on the sand of Santos,

00:10:38.102 --> 00:10:42.293
the beach resort where he used to go
before he had the accident.

00:10:42.293 --> 00:10:45.757
That's why the brain is creating
a new sensation in Bruno's head.

00:10:45.757 --> 00:10:49.456
So he walks, and at the end of the walk --
I am running out of time already --

00:10:49.456 --> 00:10:52.180
he says, "You know, guys,

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.811
I need to borrow this thing from you
when I get married,

00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:57.316
because I wanted to walk to the priest

00:10:57.316 --> 00:11:01.090
and see my bride and actually
be there by myself.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.482
Of course, he will have it
whenever he wants.

00:11:04.482 --> 00:11:08.564
And this is what we wanted to show
during the World Cup, and couldn't,

00:11:08.564 --> 00:11:12.738
because for some mysterious reason,
FIFA cut its broadcast in half.

00:11:13.618 --> 00:11:21.291
What you are going to see very quickly
is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick

00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:23.588
a few minutes before we went to the pitch

00:11:23.588 --> 00:11:26.499
and did the real thing
in front of the entire crowd,

00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:29.880
and the lights you are going to see
just describe the operation.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.768
Basically, the blue lights pulsating
indicate that the exo is ready to go.

00:11:34.768 --> 00:11:37.843
It can receive thoughts
and it can deliver feedback,

00:11:37.843 --> 00:11:40.861
and when Juliano
makes the decision to kick the ball,

00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:43.964
you are going to see
two streams of green and yellow light

00:11:43.964 --> 00:11:46.641
coming from the helmet
and going to the legs,

00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:50.742
representing the mental commands
that were taken by the exo

00:11:50.742 --> 00:11:52.641
to actually make that happen.

00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:55.336
And in basically 13 seconds,

00:11:55.336 --> 00:11:57.419
Juliano actually did.

00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:59.135
You can see the commands.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:03.475
He gets ready, 
the ball is set, and he kicks.

00:12:03.475 --> 00:12:05.353
And the most amazing thing is,

00:12:05.353 --> 00:12:08.585
10 seconds after he did that,
and looked at us on the pitch,

00:12:08.585 --> 00:12:10.862
he told us, celebrating as you saw,

00:12:10.862 --> 00:12:12.692
"I felt the ball."

00:12:13.562 --> 00:12:15.759
And that's priceless.

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:17.631
(Applause)

00:12:17.631 --> 00:12:19.131
So where is this going to go?

00:12:19.131 --> 00:12:21.066
I have two minutes to tell you

00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:24.316
that it's going to the limits
of your imagination.

00:12:24.316 --> 00:12:26.495
Brain-actuating technology is here.

00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:29.049
This is the latest: We just
published this a year ago,

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:31.282
the first brain-to-brain interface

00:12:31.282 --> 00:12:34.909
that allows two animals
to exchange mental messages

00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:38.485
so that one animal that sees something
coming from the environment

00:12:38.485 --> 00:12:44.037
can send a mental SMS,
a torpedo, a neurophysiological torpedo,

00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:45.648
to the second animal,

00:12:45.648 --> 00:12:49.525
and the second animal performs
the act that he needed to perform

00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:53.983
without ever knowing what
the environment was sending as a message,

00:12:53.983 --> 00:12:57.279
because the message came
from the first animal's brain.

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:59.649
So this is the first demo.

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:03.603
I'm going to be very quick
because I want to show you the latest.

00:13:03.603 --> 00:13:09.173
But what you see here
is the first rat getting informed

00:13:09.192 --> 00:13:12.125
by a light that is going to show up
on the left of the cage

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:15.865
that he has to press the left cage
to basically get a reward.

00:13:15.865 --> 00:13:17.658
He goes there and does it.

00:13:17.658 --> 00:13:19.984
And the same time,
he is sending a mental message

00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:23.007
to the second rat
that didn't see any light,

00:13:23.007 --> 00:13:25.368
and the second rat,
in 70 percent of the times

00:13:25.368 --> 00:13:29.581
is going to press the left lever
and get a reward

00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:33.716
without ever experiencing
the light in the retina.

00:13:33.716 --> 00:13:37.850
Well, we took this
to a little higher limit

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:42.582
by getting monkeys to collaborate 
mentally in a brain net,

00:13:42.582 --> 00:13:44.772
basically to donate their brain activity

00:13:44.772 --> 00:13:48.290
and combine them to move
the virtual arm that I showed you before,

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:53.058
and what you see here is the first time
the two monkeys combine their brains,

00:13:53.058 --> 00:13:57.316
synchronize their brains perfectly
to get this virtual arm to move.

00:13:57.316 --> 00:14:00.116
One monkey is controlling the x dimension,

00:14:00.116 --> 00:14:02.996
the other monkey
is controlling the y dimension.

00:14:02.996 --> 00:14:07.176
But it gets a little more interesting
when you get three monkeys in there

00:14:07.176 --> 00:14:10.983
and you ask one monkey to control x and y,

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:13.654
the other monkey to control y and z,

00:14:13.654 --> 00:14:16.532
and the third one to control x and z,

00:14:16.532 --> 00:14:18.648
and you make them all
play the game together,

00:14:18.648 --> 00:14:24.602
moving the arm in 3D into a target
to get the famous Brazilian orange juice.

00:14:24.602 --> 00:14:26.987
And they actually do.

00:14:26.987 --> 00:14:31.161
The black dot is the average
of all these brains working

00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:34.019
in parallel, in real time.

00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:37.105
That is the definition
of a biological computer,

00:14:37.105 --> 00:14:41.647
interacting by brain activity
and achieving a motor goal.

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:43.536
Where is this going?

00:14:43.536 --> 00:14:46.121
We have no idea.

00:14:46.121 --> 00:14:47.921
We're just scientists.

00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:49.218
(Laughter)

00:14:49.218 --> 00:14:51.774
We are paid to be children,

00:14:51.774 --> 00:14:55.764
to basically go to the edge
and discover what is out there.

00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:57.450
But one thing I know:

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.635
One day, in a few decades,

00:14:59.635 --> 00:15:03.157
when our grandchildren
surf the Net just by thinking,

00:15:03.157 --> 00:15:07.475
or a mother donates her eyesight
to an autistic kid who cannot see,

00:15:07.475 --> 00:15:10.403
or somebody speaks because
of a brain-to-brain bypass,

00:15:10.403 --> 00:15:16.730
some of you will remember
that it all started on a winter afternoon

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.502
in a Brazilian soccer field
with an impossible kick.

00:15:20.502 --> 00:15:22.498
Thank you.

00:15:22.498 --> 00:15:28.163
(Applause)

00:15:31.962 --> 00:15:35.222
Thank you.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.004
Bruno Giussani: Miguel,
thank you for sticking to your time.

00:15:51.004 --> 00:15:53.529
I actually would have given you
a couple more minutes,

00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:56.913
because there are a couple of points
we want to develop, and, of course,

00:15:56.913 --> 00:16:00.810
clearly it seems that we need connected 
brains to figure out where this is going.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.712
So let's connect all this together.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.381
So if I'm understanding correctly,

00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:06.880
one of the monkeys
is actually getting a signal

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.146
and the other monkey
is reacting to that signal

00:16:09.146 --> 00:16:13.631
just because the first one is receiving it
and transmitting the neurological impulse.

00:16:13.631 --> 00:16:15.855
Miguel Nicolelis: 
No, it's a little different.

00:16:15.855 --> 00:16:18.746
No monkey knows of the existence
of the other two monkeys.

00:16:18.746 --> 00:16:21.682
They are getting a visual feedback in 2D,

00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:24.355
but the task they have
to accomplish is 3D.

00:16:24.355 --> 00:16:26.954
They have to move an arm
in three dimensions.

00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:30.356
But each monkey is only getting
the two dimensions on the video screen

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:32.132
that the monkey controls.

00:16:32.132 --> 00:16:35.150
And to get that thing done,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.964
you need at least two monkeys
to synchronize their brains,

00:16:37.964 --> 00:16:39.735
but the ideal is three.

00:16:39.735 --> 00:16:43.351
So what we found out is that
when one monkey starts slacking down,

00:16:43.351 --> 00:16:45.962
the other two monkeys
enhance their performance

00:16:45.962 --> 00:16:47.944
to get the guy to come back,

00:16:47.944 --> 00:16:50.050
so this adjusts dynamically,

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.399
but the global synchrony remains the same.

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:57.023
Now, if you flip
without telling the monkey

00:16:57.023 --> 00:16:59.321
the dimensions that each brain
has to control,

00:16:59.321 --> 00:17:01.620
like this guy is controlling x and y,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.035
but he should be controlling now y and z,

00:17:04.035 --> 00:17:08.818
instantaneously, that animal's brain
forgets about the old dimensions

00:17:08.818 --> 00:17:11.336
and it starts concentrating
on the new dimensions.

00:17:11.336 --> 00:17:14.623
So what I need to say is
that no Turing machine,

00:17:14.623 --> 00:17:18.825
no computer can predict
what a brain net will do.

00:17:18.825 --> 00:17:21.206
So we will absorb technology
as part of us.

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:23.815
Technology will never absorb us.

00:17:23.815 --> 00:17:26.456
It's simply impossible.

00:17:26.456 --> 00:17:29.506
BG: How many times have you tested this?

00:17:29.506 --> 00:17:32.051
And how many times
have you succeeded versus failed?

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.327
MN: Oh, tens of times.

00:17:34.327 --> 00:17:36.565
With the three monkeys?
Oh, several times.

00:17:36.565 --> 00:17:41.185
I wouldn't be able to talk about this here
unless I had done it a few times.

00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:43.786
And I forgot to mention, because of time,

00:17:43.786 --> 00:17:47.547
that just three weeks ago,
a European group

00:17:47.547 --> 00:17:52.637
just demonstrated the first
man-to-man brain-to-brain connection.

00:17:52.637 --> 00:17:54.157
BG: And how does that play?

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:58.739
MN: There was one bit of information --
big ideas start in a humble way --

00:17:58.739 --> 00:18:05.102
but basically the brain activity
of one subject

00:18:05.102 --> 00:18:09.308
was transmitted to a second object,
all non-invasive technology.

00:18:09.308 --> 00:18:13.552
So the first subject got a message,
like our rats, a visual message,

00:18:13.552 --> 00:18:16.106
and transmitted it to the second subject.

00:18:16.106 --> 00:18:20.588
The second subject received
a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex,

00:18:20.588 --> 00:18:24.094
or a different pulse,
two different pulses.

00:18:24.094 --> 00:18:26.799
In one pulse, the subject saw something.

00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:28.935
On the other pulse,
he saw something different.

00:18:28.935 --> 00:18:30.918
And he was able to verbally indicate

00:18:30.918 --> 00:18:33.958
what was the message
the first subject was sending

00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.853
through the Internet across continents.

00:18:36.853 --> 00:18:39.372
Moderator: Wow.
Okay, that's where we are going.

00:18:39.372 --> 00:18:41.689
That's the next TED Talk
at the next conference.

00:18:41.689 --> 00:18:44.596
Miguel Nicolelis, thank you.
MN: Thank you, Bruno. Thank you.
