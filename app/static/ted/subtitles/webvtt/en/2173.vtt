00:00:00.954 --> 00:00:08.319
It is very fashionable and proper 
to speak about food


00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:15.529
in all its forms, all its colors, 
aromas and tastes.

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.183
But after the food goes through 
the digestive system,

00:00:21.183 --> 00:00:24.429
when it is thrown out as crap,

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.026
it is no longer fashionable
to speak about it.

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:32.685
It is rather revolting.

00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:40.362
I'm a guy who has graduated 
from bullshit to full-shit.

00:00:40.732 --> 00:00:43.801
(Laughter)

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:50.466
My organization, Gram Vikas, which means
"village development organization,"

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.572
was working in the area 
of renewable energy.

00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:57.322
On the most part, we were 
producing biogas,

00:00:57.322 --> 00:01:01.140
biogas for rural kitchens.

00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:08.050
We produce biogas in India 
by using animal manure,

00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:10.551
which usually, in India, 
is called cow dung.

00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:14.605
But as the gender-sensitive 
person that I am,

00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:17.533
I would like to call it bullshit.

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.916
But realizing later on

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:27.493
how important were sanitation
and the disposal of crap in a proper way,

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:32.051
we went into the arena of sanitation.

00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:41.870
Eighty percent of all diseases 
in India and most developing countries

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.917
are because of poor quality water.

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:49.511
And when we look at the reason 
for poor quality water,

00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:55.309
you find that it is our abysmal attitude 
to the disposal of human waste.

00:01:56.305 --> 00:02:00.344
Human waste, in its rawest form,

00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:06.400
finds its way back to drinking water,
bathing water, washing water,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.828
irrigation water, whatever water you see.

00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:15.874
And this is the cause for 80 percent 
of the diseases in rural areas.

00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:23.695
In India, it is unfortunately only the
women who carry water.

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:27.303
So for all domestic needs,
women have to carry water.

00:02:28.824 --> 00:02:33.098
So that is a pitiable state of affairs.

00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:36.761
Open defecation is rampant.

00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:40.866
Seventy percent of India
defecates in the open.

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:44.150
They sit there out in the open,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.178
with the wind on their sails,

00:02:46.178 --> 00:02:50.021
hiding their faces, exposing their bases,

00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:54.889
and sitting there in pristine glory --

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.195
70 percent of India.

00:02:57.195 --> 00:03:00.428
And if you look at the world total,

00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:06.963
60 percent of all the crap that is thrown
into the open is by Indians.

00:03:09.153 --> 00:03:11.929
A fantastic distinction.

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:16.081
I don't know if we Indians can be proud
of such a distinction.

00:03:16.081 --> 00:03:17.991
(Laughter)

00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:20.278
So we, together with a lot of villages,

00:03:20.278 --> 00:03:25.022
we began to talk about how to really 
address this situation of sanitation.

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:30.979
And we came together and formed 
a project called MANTRA.

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:37.836
MANTRA stands for Movement and Action
Network for Transformation of Rural Areas.

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:44.412
So we are speaking about transformation,
transformation in rural areas.

00:03:45.612 --> 00:03:49.224
Villages that agree 
to implement this project,

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:52.087
they organize a legal society

00:03:52.087 --> 00:03:56.453
where the general body 
consists of all members

00:03:56.453 --> 00:04:02.336
who elect a group of men and women
who implement the project

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:07.101
and, later on, who look after
the operation and maintenance.

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:12.862
They decide to build a toilet 
and a shower room.

00:04:12.862 --> 00:04:15.943
And from a protected water source,

00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:22.862
water will be brought to an elevated water
reservoir and piped to all households

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.327
through three taps:

00:04:25.327 --> 00:04:31.629
one in the toilet, one in the shower, 
one in the kitchen, 24 hours a day.

00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:36.940
The pity is that our cities,
like New Delhi and Bombay,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.371
do not have a 24-hour water supply.

00:04:40.371 --> 00:04:44.174
But in these villages, we want to have it.

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:48.568
There is a distinct difference 
in the quality.

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:55.328
Well in India, we have a theory,
which is very much accepted

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:58.910
by the government bureaucracy
and all those who matter,

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.823
that poor people deserve poor solutions

00:05:03.823 --> 00:05:10.058
and absolutely poor people deserve
pathetic solutions.

00:05:10.058 --> 00:05:16.503
This, combined with 
a Nobel Prize-worthy theory that

00:05:16.503 --> 00:05:18.872
the cheapest is the most economic,

00:05:18.872 --> 00:05:23.560
is the heady cocktail that the poor
are forced to drink.

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:28.450
We are fighting against this.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.941
We feel that the poor have been
humiliated for centuries.

00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:37.359
And even in sanitation,

00:05:37.359 --> 00:05:39.545
they should not be humiliated.

00:05:39.545 --> 00:05:42.239
Sanitation is more about dignity

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:44.907
than about human disposal of waste.

00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:49.236
And so you build these toilets 
and very often,

00:05:49.236 --> 00:05:55.442
we have to hear that the toilets are
better than their houses.

00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:59.323
And you can see that in front are 
the attached houses

00:05:59.323 --> 00:06:02.151
and the others are the toilets.

00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:08.799
So these people, without a single
exception of a family in a village,

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:11.455
decide to build a toilet, a bathing room.

00:06:12.598 --> 00:06:18.256
And for that, they come together,
collect all the local materials --

00:06:18.256 --> 00:06:23.611
local materials like rubble, 
sand, aggregates,

00:06:23.611 --> 00:06:26.139
usually a government subsidy is available

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.417
to meet at least part of the cost 
of external materials

00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:32.926
like cement, steel, toilet commode.

00:06:34.211 --> 00:06:36.598
And they build a toilet 
and a bathing room.

00:06:38.317 --> 00:06:44.695
Also, all the unskilled laborers, that is 
daily wage earners, mostly landless,

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:51.499
are given an opportunity to be 
trained as masons and plumbers.

00:06:52.098 --> 00:06:57.175
So while these people are being trained, 
others are collecting the materials.

00:06:57.175 --> 00:07:02.841
And when both are ready,
they build a toilet, a shower room,

00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:09.840
and of course also a water tower, 
an elevated water reservoir.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.171
We use a system of two leach pits 
to treat the waste.

00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:19.469
From the toilet, the muck comes
into the first leach pit.

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:24.494
And when it is full, it is blocked 
and it can go to the next.

00:07:24.494 --> 00:07:29.343
But we discovered that if you plant
banana trees, papaya trees

00:07:29.343 --> 00:07:32.726
on the periphery of these leach pits,

00:07:32.726 --> 00:07:35.987
they grow very well
because they suck up all the nutrients

00:07:35.987 --> 00:07:41.478
and you get very tasty bananas, papayas.

00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:44.180
If any of you come to my place,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.293
I would be happy to share
these bananas and papayas with you.

00:07:49.478 --> 00:07:55.288
So there you can see 
the completed toilets, the water towers.

00:07:55.288 --> 00:07:59.378
This is in a village where 
most of the people are even illiterate.

00:08:01.098 --> 00:08:03.508
It is always a 24-hour water supply

00:08:03.508 --> 00:08:09.114
because water gets polluted
very often when you store it --

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:14.936
a child dips his or her hand into it,
something falls into it.

00:08:14.936 --> 00:08:19.225
So no water is stored. It's always on tap.

00:08:21.288 --> 00:08:25.416
This is how an elevated 
water reservoir is constructed.

00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:27.596
And that is the end product.

00:08:27.596 --> 00:08:32.283
Because it has to go high,
and there is some space available,

00:08:32.283 --> 00:08:35.159
two or three rooms are made
under the water tower,

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:39.801
which are used by the village for 
different committee meetings.

00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:45.802
We have had clear evidence
of the great impact of this program.

00:08:46.675 --> 00:08:50.428
Before we started, there were, as usual,

00:08:50.428 --> 00:08:55.713
more than 80 percent of people suffering
from waterborne diseases.

00:08:55.858 --> 00:09:02.231
But after this, we have empirical evidence
that 82 percent, on average,

00:09:02.231 --> 00:09:06.686
among all these villages --
1,200 villages have completed it --

00:09:06.686 --> 00:09:11.823
waterborne diseases 
have come down 82 percent.

00:09:11.823 --> 00:09:18.073
(Applause)

00:09:18.073 --> 00:09:23.411
Women usually used to spend, 
especially in the summer months,

00:09:23.544 --> 00:09:30.295
about six to seven hours 
a day carrying water.

00:09:31.206 --> 00:09:34.890
And when they went to carry water,

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:40.259
because, as I said earlier,
it's only women who carry water,

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:46.834
they used to take their little children,
girl children, also to carry water,

00:09:46.834 --> 00:09:51.615
or else to be back at home
to look after the siblings.

00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:55.856
So there were less than nine percent
of girl children attending school,

00:09:55.856 --> 00:09:58.207
even if there was a school.

00:09:58.207 --> 00:10:01.179
And boys, about 30 percent.

00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:08.148
But girls, it has gone to about 90 percent
and boys, almost to 100 percent.

00:10:08.148 --> 00:10:12.795
(Applause)

00:10:12.795 --> 00:10:16.027
The most vulnerable section in a village

00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:20.086
are the landless laborers who are
the daily wage-earners.

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:22.696
Because they have gone 
through this training

00:10:22.696 --> 00:10:26.296
to be masons and plumbers and bar benders,

00:10:26.296 --> 00:10:32.559
now their ability to earn has 
increased 300 to 400 percent.

00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:37.765
So this is a democracy in action

00:10:37.765 --> 00:10:41.591
because there is a general body, 
a governing board, the committee.

00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:44.461
People are questioning, 
people are governing themselves,

00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:47.110
people are learning to manage
their own affairs,

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.167
they are taking their own futures
into their hands.

00:10:50.882 --> 00:10:56.731
And that is democracy at
the grassroots level in action.

00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:04.005
More than 1,200 villages 
have so far done this.

00:11:05.035 --> 00:11:10.614
It benefits over 400,000 people
and it's still going on.

00:11:10.614 --> 00:11:15.625
And I hope it continues to move ahead.

00:11:17.245 --> 00:11:22.052
For India and such developing countries,

00:11:22.052 --> 00:11:27.684
armies and armaments,

00:11:27.684 --> 00:11:33.232
software companies and spaceships

00:11:36.486 --> 00:11:42.944
may not be as important
as taps and toilets.

00:11:42.944 --> 00:11:45.366
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:49.897
(Applause)

00:11:49.897 --> 00:11:53.803
Thank you.
