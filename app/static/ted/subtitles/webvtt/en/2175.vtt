00:00:00.378 --> 00:00:01.645
Hi.

00:00:01.645 --> 00:00:04.837
Today I'm going to share
my personal journey

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:08.885
with female genital mutilation, FGM.

00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:13.557
Feel free to cry, laugh, cross your legs,

00:00:13.557 --> 00:00:15.828
or do anything your body feels like doing.

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:19.086
I'm not going to name
the things your body does.

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.302
I was born in Sierra Leone.

00:00:21.302 --> 00:00:23.403
Did anybody watch "Blood Diamond"?

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:26.888
If you have any thoughts --

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:30.096
I don't have any diamonds 
on me, by the way.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:33.355
If you have heard of Ebola,
well, that's in Sierra Leone as well.

00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:35.113
I don't have Ebola. You're all safe.

00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:36.527
Don't rush to the door.

00:00:36.527 --> 00:00:40.437
Be seated. You're fine.
I was checked before I got here.

00:00:41.397 --> 00:00:44.246
My grandfather had three wives.

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:46.575
Don't ask me why a man
needs more than one wife.

00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:48.584
Men, do you need more than one wife?

00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:50.292
I don't think so. There you go.

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:53.926
He was looking for a heart attack,
that's what I say.

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:55.559
Oh yeah, he was.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.452
When I was three, war broke out
in Sierra Leone in 1991.

00:01:00.452 --> 00:01:04.428
I remember literally going to bed
one night, everything was good.

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:06.140
The next day, I woke up,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.081
bombs were dropping everywhere,

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:10.662
and people were trying
to kill me and my family.

00:01:10.662 --> 00:01:15.465
We escaped the war and ended up
in Gambia, in West Africa.

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:18.335
Ebola is there as well. Stay away from it.

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:20.868
While we were there as refugees,

00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:24.684
we didn't know what
was going to become of us.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.573
My mom applied for refugee status.

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:29.304
She's a wonderful, smart woman, that one,

00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:30.583
and we were lucky.

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:33.393
Australia said, we will take you in.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:35.129
Good job, Aussies.

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:39.350
Before we were meant to travel,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.192
my mom came home one day, and said,

00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:44.370
"We're going on 
a little holiday, a little trip."

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.668
She put us in a car,

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:49.273
and we drove for hours
and ended up in a bush

00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:51.928
in a remote area in Gambia.

00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:55.677
In this bush, we found two huts.

00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:59.899
An old lady came towards us.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.646
She was ethnic-looking, very old.

00:02:02.646 --> 00:02:04.770
She had a chat with my mom, and went back.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.188
Then she came back and walked
away from us into a second hut.

00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:11.552
I'm standing there thinking,

00:02:11.552 --> 00:02:14.221
"This is very confusing.
I don't know what's going on."

00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:16.023
The next thing I knew,

00:02:16.023 --> 00:02:17.989
my mom took me into this hut.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.065
She took my clothes off,

00:02:21.065 --> 00:02:24.287
and then she pinned me down on the floor.

00:02:25.347 --> 00:02:28.935
I struggled and tried
to get her off me, but I couldn't.

00:02:28.935 --> 00:02:32.530
Then the old lady came towards me
with a rusty-looking knife,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.410
one of the sharp knives,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.613
orange-looking, has never seen
water or sunlight before.

00:02:38.613 --> 00:02:40.317
I thought she was going to slaughter me,

00:02:40.317 --> 00:02:42.344
but she didn't.

00:02:42.344 --> 00:02:45.486
She slowly slid down my body

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:48.893
and ended up where my vagina is.

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:54.045
She took hold of what I now know
to be my clitoris,

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:01.663
she took that rusty knife,
and started cutting away, inch by inch.

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:07.056
I screamed, I cried,

00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:11.738
and asked my mom to get off me
so this pain will stop,

00:03:11.747 --> 00:03:14.928
but all she did was say, "Be quiet."

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:20.956
This old lady sawed away at my flesh
for what felt like forever,

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:23.019
and then when she was done,

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.834
she threw that piece of flesh
across the floor

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:31.460
as if it was the most disgusting thing
she's ever touched.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.966
They both got off me,
and left me there bleeding,

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:40.811
crying, and confused
as to what just happened.

00:03:41.703 --> 00:03:43.805
We never talked about this again.

00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:47.280
Very soon, we found
that we were coming to Australia,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.015
and this is when you had
the Sydney Olympics at the time,

00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:52.572
and people said we were going
to the end of the world,

00:03:52.572 --> 00:03:54.669
there was nowhere else
to go after Australia.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.294
Yeah, that comforted us a bit.

00:03:57.294 --> 00:03:59.607
It took us three days to get here.

00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:04.335
We went to Senegal, then France,
and then Singapore.

00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:07.144
We went to the bathroom to wash our hands.

00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:11.864
We spent 15 minutes
opening the tap like this.

00:04:11.864 --> 00:04:13.651
Then somebody came in,

00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:15.748
slid their hand under and water came out,

00:04:15.748 --> 00:04:18.255
and we thought, is this what we're in for?

00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:20.833
Like, seriously.

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:23.641
We got to Adelaide, small place,

00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:26.968
where literally they dumped us
in Adelaide, that's what I would say.

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:28.407
They dumped us there.

00:04:28.407 --> 00:04:30.015
We were very grateful.

00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:31.678
We settled and we liked it.

00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:33.937
We were like, "We're home, we're here."

00:04:33.937 --> 00:04:36.571
Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall.

00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:37.880
Adelaide has only one mall.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.946
It's this small place.

00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:43.028
And we saw a lot of Asian people.

00:04:43.028 --> 00:04:45.230
My mom said all of a sudden, panicking,

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.496
"You brought us to the wrong place.
You must take us back to Australia."

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.851
Yeah. It had to be explained to her that 
there were a lot of Asians in Australia

00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:58.509
and we were in the right place.

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.411
So fine, it's all good.

00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:03.166
My mom then had this brilliant idea

00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:06.482
that I should go to a girls school
because they were less racist.

00:05:06.482 --> 00:05:09.693
I don't know where she read 
that publication. (Laughter)

00:05:09.693 --> 00:05:13.290
Never found evidence of it to this day.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.046
Six hundred white kids, 
and I was the only black child there.

00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:20.112
No, I was the only person
with a bit of a color on me.

00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:22.674
Let me say that. Chocolate color.

00:05:23.444 --> 00:05:26.055
There were no Asians, no indigenous.

00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:27.782
All we had was some tan girls,

00:05:27.782 --> 00:05:29.899
girls who felt the need
to be under the sun.

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:33.684
It wasn't the same as my chocolate,
though. Not the same.

00:05:33.684 --> 00:05:36.382
Settling in Australia was quite hard,

00:05:36.382 --> 00:05:39.700
but it became harder when I started
volunteering for an organization

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.212
called Women's Health Statewide,

00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:46.411
and I joined their
female genital mutilation program

00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:50.161
without any awareness of what
this program was actually about,

00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:52.616
or that it related to me in any way.

00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:55.566
I spent months educating
nurses and doctors

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:58.103
about what female genital mutilation was

00:05:58.103 --> 00:05:59.592
and where it was practiced:

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:04.866
Africa, the Middle East, Asia,
and now, Australia and London and America,

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.362
because, as we all know,
we live in a multicultural society,

00:06:08.362 --> 00:06:12.765
and people who come from those backgrounds
come with their culture,

00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:18.470
and sometimes they have cultural practices
that we may not agree with,

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.781
but they continue to practice them.

00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:23.662
One day, I was looking at the chart

00:06:23.662 --> 00:06:26.984
of the different types
of female genital mutilation,

00:06:26.984 --> 00:06:29.441
FGM, I will just say FGM for short.

00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:32.609
Type I is when they cut off the hood.

00:06:32.609 --> 00:06:35.877
Type II is when
they cut off the whole clitoris

00:06:35.877 --> 00:06:40.002
and some of your labia majora,
or your outer lips,

00:06:40.002 --> 00:06:42.739
and Type III is when they 
cut off the whole clitoris

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:44.584
and then they sew you up

00:06:44.584 --> 00:06:48.687
so you only have a little hole
to pee and have your period.

00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:51.016
My eyes went onto Type II.

00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:53.306
Before all of this,
I pretty much had amnesia.

00:06:53.306 --> 00:06:56.733
I was in so much shock 
and traumatized by what had happened,

00:06:56.733 --> 00:06:58.864
I didn't remember any of it.

00:06:58.864 --> 00:07:01.139
Yes, I was aware something bad
happened to me,

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:03.351
but I had no recollection
of what had happened.

00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:05.312
I knew I had a scar down there,

00:07:05.312 --> 00:07:07.455
but I thought everybody
had a scar down there.

00:07:07.455 --> 00:07:09.188
This had happened to everybody else.

00:07:09.188 --> 00:07:13.397
But when I looked at Type II,
it all came back to me.

00:07:13.397 --> 00:07:15.733
I remembered what was done to me.

00:07:15.733 --> 00:07:17.740
I remembered being in that hut

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.569
with that old lady and my mom
holding me down.

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:27.214
Words cannot express the pain I felt,

00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:30.191
the confusion that I felt,

00:07:30.191 --> 00:07:34.993
because now I realized that 
what was done to me was a terrible thing

00:07:34.993 --> 00:07:37.977
that in this society was called barbaric,

00:07:37.977 --> 00:07:39.944
it was called mutilation.

00:07:39.944 --> 00:07:42.107
My mother had said
it was called circumcision,

00:07:42.107 --> 00:07:44.327
but here it was mutilation.

00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:47.384
I was thinking, I'm mutilated?
I'm a mutilated person.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.114
Oh my God.

00:07:49.114 --> 00:07:51.002
And then the anger came.

00:07:51.002 --> 00:07:55.002
I was a black angry woman.
(Laughter)

00:07:55.002 --> 00:07:56.379
Oh yeah.

00:07:56.379 --> 00:07:58.864
A little one, but angry nevertheless.

00:07:59.994 --> 00:08:03.720
I went home and said to my mom,

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.665
"You did something."

00:08:05.665 --> 00:08:08.551
This is not the African thing to do,
pointing at your mother,

00:08:08.551 --> 00:08:10.762
but hey, I was ready for any consequences.

00:08:10.762 --> 00:08:12.892
"You did something to me."

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:15.250
She's like, "What are you
talking about, Khadija?"

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.936
She's used to me mouthing off.

00:08:16.936 --> 00:08:21.111
I'm like, "Those years ago,
You circumcised me.

00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:24.594
You cut away something
that belonged to me."

00:08:24.594 --> 00:08:26.414
She said, "Yes, I did.

00:08:26.414 --> 00:08:29.384
I did it for your own good.

00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:33.232
It was in your best interest.

00:08:33.232 --> 00:08:36.417
Your grandmother did it to me,
and I did it to you.

00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:38.368
It's made you a woman."

00:08:38.368 --> 00:08:40.120
I'm like, "How?"

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.206
She said, "You're empowered, Khadija.

00:08:42.206 --> 00:08:44.023
Do you get itchy down there?"

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.341
I'm like, "No, why would I
get itchy down there?"

00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:49.020
She said, "Well,
if you were not circumcised,

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.179
you would get itchy down there.

00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:54.314
Women who are not circumcised
get itchy all the time.

00:08:54.314 --> 00:08:57.373
Then they sleep around with everybody.

00:08:57.373 --> 00:09:00.185
You are not going
to sleep around with anybody."

00:09:00.185 --> 00:09:01.919
And I thought,

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:07.147
her definition of empowerment
was very strange. (Laughter)

00:09:08.827 --> 00:09:11.078
That was the end
of our first conversation.

00:09:11.078 --> 00:09:12.389
I went back to school.

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:15.885
These were the days when we had 
Dolly and Girlfriend magazines.

00:09:15.885 --> 00:09:20.152
There was always the sealed section.
Anybody remember those sealed sections?

00:09:20.152 --> 00:09:22.226
The naughty bits, you know?

00:09:22.226 --> 00:09:25.101
Oh yeah, I love those.
(Laughter)

00:09:25.101 --> 00:09:28.694
Anyway, there was always
an article about pleasure

00:09:28.694 --> 00:09:31.960
and relationships and, of course, sex.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.966
But it always assumed
that you had a clitoris, though,

00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:39.649
and I thought, this doesn't fit me.

00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:42.467
This doesn't talk about people like me.

00:09:42.467 --> 00:09:44.120
I don't have a clitoris.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.272
I watched TV and those women
would moan like, "Oh! Oh!"

00:09:48.272 --> 00:09:51.275
I was like, these people
and their damned clitoris.

00:09:51.275 --> 00:09:52.958
(Laughter)

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.991
What is a woman without a clitoris
supposed to do with her life?

00:09:56.991 --> 00:09:58.524
That's what I want to know.

00:09:58.524 --> 00:10:02.394
I want to do that too --
"Oh! Oh!" and all of that.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:04.072
Didn't happen.

00:10:04.072 --> 00:10:07.157
So I came home once again
and said to my mom,

00:10:07.157 --> 00:10:11.653
"Dolly and Girlfriend said
I deserve pleasure,

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.596
that I should be having orgasms,

00:10:13.603 --> 00:10:18.248
and that white men should figure out
how to find the clitoris."

00:10:18.248 --> 00:10:21.504
Apparently, white men
have a problem finding the clitoris.

00:10:21.504 --> 00:10:23.410
(Laughter)

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.017
Just saying, it wasn't me.
It was Dolly that said that.

00:10:28.017 --> 00:10:31.608
And I thought to myself,
I had an inner joke in my head

00:10:31.608 --> 00:10:34.719
that said, "I will marry a white man.

00:10:34.719 --> 00:10:38.300
He won't have that problem with me."
(Laughter)

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.836
So I said to my mom,

00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:46.935
"Dolly and Girlfriend said
I deserve pleasure, and do you know

00:10:46.935 --> 00:10:50.720
what you have taken away from me,
what you have denied me?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.893
You have invaded me
in the most sacred way.

00:10:53.893 --> 00:10:55.446
I want pleasure.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:58.751
I want to get horny, dammit, as well."

00:10:58.751 --> 00:11:01.469
And she said to me,
"Who is Dolly and Girlfriend?

00:11:01.469 --> 00:11:03.929
Are they your new friends, Khadija?"

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:07.784
I was like, "No, they're not.
That's a magazine, mom, a magazine."

00:11:07.784 --> 00:11:09.399
She didn't get it.

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:11.507
We came from two different worlds.

00:11:11.507 --> 00:11:15.112
When she was growing up,
not having a clitoris was the norm.

00:11:15.112 --> 00:11:17.786
It was celebrated.

00:11:17.786 --> 00:11:20.153
I was an African Australian girl.

00:11:20.153 --> 00:11:23.962
I lived in a society
that was very clitoris-centric.

00:11:23.962 --> 00:11:28.193
It was all about the damn clitoris!

00:11:28.193 --> 00:11:29.912
And I didn't have one!

00:11:29.912 --> 00:11:33.466
That pissed me off.

00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:37.270
So once I went through
this strange phase of anger

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.976
and pain and confusion,

00:11:38.976 --> 00:11:41.560
I remember booking
an appointment with my therapist.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.585
Yes, I'm an African 
who has a therapist. There you go.

00:11:44.585 --> 00:11:47.566
And I said to her,

00:11:47.566 --> 00:11:50.001
"I was 13. I was a child.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.524
I was settling in a new country,

00:11:51.524 --> 00:11:54.569
I was dealing with racism
and discrimination,

00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:57.463
English is my third language,
and then there it was."

00:11:57.463 --> 00:12:00.350
I said to her, "I feel like
I'm not a woman

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.774
because of what was done to me.

00:12:02.774 --> 00:12:05.530
I feel incomplete.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.901
Am I going to be asexual?"

00:12:08.901 --> 00:12:11.704
Because from what I knew about FGM,

00:12:11.704 --> 00:12:15.386
the whole aim of it was to control
the sexuality of women.

00:12:15.386 --> 00:12:18.530
It's so that we don't have
any sexual desire.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.317
And I said, "Am I asexual now?

00:12:20.317 --> 00:12:23.678
Will I just live the rest of my life
not feeling like having sex,

00:12:23.678 --> 00:12:26.190
not enjoying sex?"

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.810
She couldn't answer my questions,

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.463
so they went unanswered.

00:12:31.463 --> 00:12:34.092
When I started having my period
around the age of 14,

00:12:34.092 --> 00:12:37.973
I realized I didn't have 
normal periods because of FGM.

00:12:37.973 --> 00:12:43.719
My periods were heavy, they were long,
and they were very painful.

00:12:43.726 --> 00:12:45.709
Then they told me I had fibroids.

00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:48.336
They're like these little balls
sitting there.

00:12:48.336 --> 00:12:51.080
One was covering one of my ovaries.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.165
And there came then the big news.

00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:57.416
"We don't think you can
have children, Khadija."

00:12:57.416 --> 00:13:02.138
And once again, I was
an angry black woman.

00:13:02.138 --> 00:13:05.313
I went home and I said to my mom,

00:13:05.313 --> 00:13:09.807
"Your act, your action,
no matter what your may defense may be" --

00:13:09.807 --> 00:13:12.401
because she thought she did it out love --

00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:17.029
"what you did out of love 
is harming me, and it's hurting me.

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:20.851
What do you have to say for that?"

00:13:20.851 --> 00:13:24.035
She said, "I did what I had to do
as a mother."

00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:26.744
I'm still waiting
for an apology, by the way.

00:13:28.124 --> 00:13:30.511
Then I got married.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.949
And once again --

00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:36.177
FGM is like the gift that keeps giving.

00:13:36.177 --> 00:13:38.862
You figure that out very soon.

00:13:38.862 --> 00:13:41.888
Sex was very painful.

00:13:41.888 --> 00:13:44.138
It hurt all the time.

00:13:44.138 --> 00:13:47.836
And of course I realized, they said,
"You can't have kids."

00:13:47.836 --> 00:13:53.769
I thought, "Wow, is this my existence?
Is this what life is all about?"

00:13:56.843 --> 00:13:59.045
I'm proud to tell you,

00:13:59.045 --> 00:14:00.921
five months ago,

00:14:00.921 --> 00:14:03.435
I was told I was pregnant.

00:14:03.435 --> 00:14:07.831
(Applause)

00:14:12.027 --> 00:14:13.842
I am the lucky girl.

00:14:13.842 --> 00:14:16.652
There are so many women out there
who have gone through FGM

00:14:16.652 --> 00:14:18.283
who have infertility.

00:14:18.283 --> 00:14:24.943
I know a nine-year-old girl who has
incontinence, constant infections, pain.

00:14:25.513 --> 00:14:28.140
It's that gift. It doesn't stop giving.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.286
It affects every area of your life,

00:14:31.286 --> 00:14:34.572
and this happened to me
because I was born a girl

00:14:34.572 --> 00:14:36.301
in the wrong place.

00:14:36.301 --> 00:14:38.845
That's why it happened to me.

00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:43.117
I channel all that anger, 
all that pain, into advocacy

00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:46.587
because I needed my pain
to be worth something.

00:14:46.587 --> 00:14:50.658
So I'm the director of an organization
called No FGM Australia.

00:14:50.663 --> 00:14:52.107
You heard me right.

00:14:52.107 --> 00:14:53.775
Why No FGM Australia?

00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:56.941
FGM is in Australia.

00:14:56.941 --> 00:15:00.606
Two days ago, I had to call
Child Protective Services,

00:15:00.606 --> 00:15:03.401
because somewhere in Australia,

00:15:03.401 --> 00:15:05.547
there's a four-year old

00:15:05.547 --> 00:15:10.277
there's a four-year-old whose mom 
is planning on performing FGM on her.

00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:16.381
That child is in kindy.
I'll let that sink in: four years old.

00:15:19.432 --> 00:15:23.763
A couple of months ago, I met a lady
who is married to a Malaysian man.

00:15:23.763 --> 00:15:27.334
Her husband came home one day and said
he was going to take their daughters

00:15:27.334 --> 00:15:29.709
back to Malaysia
to cut off their clitoris.

00:15:29.709 --> 00:15:33.443
And she said, "Why?"
He said they were dirty.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.728
And she said, "Well, you married me."

00:15:35.728 --> 00:15:38.278
He said, "Oh, this is my cultural belief."

00:15:39.278 --> 00:15:42.163
They then went into a whole discussion
where she said to him,

00:15:42.163 --> 00:15:45.255
"Over my dead body
will you do that to my daughters."

00:15:45.255 --> 00:15:49.004
But imagine if this woman
wasn't aware of what FGM was,

00:15:49.004 --> 00:15:51.161
if they never had that conversation?

00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:54.399
Her children would have been
flown over to Malaysia

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:57.709
and they would have come back
changed for the rest of their lives.

00:15:57.709 --> 00:15:59.416
Do you know the millions of dollars

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:01.802
it would take us to deal
with an issue like that?

00:16:01.802 --> 00:16:04.561
[Three children per day] in Australia

00:16:04.561 --> 00:16:07.760
are at risk of having FGM
performed on them.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.261
This is an Australian problem, people.

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:13.268
It's not an African problem.
It's not a Middle Eastern problem.

00:16:13.268 --> 00:16:18.411
It's not white, it's not black,
it has no color, it's everybody's problem.

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:21.844
FGM is child abuse.

00:16:21.844 --> 00:16:23.754
It's violence against women.

00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:27.769
It's saying that women don't have
a right to sexual pleasure.

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:30.804
It says we don't have
a right to our bodies.

00:16:30.804 --> 00:16:34.613
Well, I say no to that,
and you know what? Bullshit.

00:16:34.613 --> 00:16:36.719
That's what I have to say to that.

00:16:36.719 --> 00:16:41.600
(Applause)

00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:48.514
I am proud to say that
I'm doing my part in ending FGM.

00:16:48.514 --> 00:16:50.646
What are you going to do?

00:16:50.646 --> 00:16:55.297
There may be a child in your classroom
who is at risk of FGM.

00:16:55.297 --> 00:16:58.393
There may be a patient
who comes to your hospital

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:00.026
who is at risk of FGM.

00:17:00.026 --> 00:17:02.385
But this is the reality,

00:17:02.385 --> 00:17:04.465
that even in our beloved Australia,

00:17:04.465 --> 00:17:06.567
the most wonderful place in the world,

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:10.653
children are being abused
because of a culture.

00:17:10.653 --> 00:17:13.612
Culture should not be
a defense for child abuse.

00:17:13.612 --> 00:17:18.655
I want ever single one of you
to see FGM as an issue for you.

00:17:18.655 --> 00:17:20.141
Make it personal.

00:17:20.141 --> 00:17:23.230
It could be your daughter,
your sister, your cousin.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.391
I can't fight FGM alone.

00:17:26.321 --> 00:17:28.928
I could try, but I can't.

00:17:28.928 --> 00:17:31.733
So my appeal to you is, please join me.

00:17:31.733 --> 00:17:33.846
Sign my petition on Change.org

00:17:33.846 --> 00:17:37.833
and type in Khadija, my name,
and it'll come up, and sign it.

00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:41.425
The aim of that is to get support
for FGM victims in Australia

00:17:41.425 --> 00:17:43.688
and to protect little girls
growing up here

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:46.826
to not have this evil done to them,

00:17:46.826 --> 00:17:50.509
because every child
has a right to pleasure.

00:17:50.509 --> 00:17:53.970
Every child has a right
to their bodies being left intact,

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.687
and dammit, ever child
has a right to a clitoris.

00:17:58.687 --> 00:18:02.352
So please join me in ending this act.

00:18:02.352 --> 00:18:04.501
My favorite quote is,

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:06.349
"All it takes for evil to prevail

00:18:06.349 --> 00:18:09.783
is for a few good men
and women to do nothing."

00:18:09.783 --> 00:18:14.652
Are you going to let this evil
of female genital mutilation

00:18:14.652 --> 00:18:16.884
to prevail in Australia?

00:18:16.884 --> 00:18:18.172
I don't think so,

00:18:18.172 --> 00:18:22.198
so please join me in ensuring
that it ends in my generation.

00:18:22.198 --> 00:18:24.269
Thank you.

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:26.707
(Applause)
