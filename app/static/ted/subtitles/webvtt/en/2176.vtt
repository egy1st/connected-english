00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:05.802
So recently, we heard a lot about
how social media helps empower protest,

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.181
and that's true,

00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:08.836
but after more than a decade

00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:12.501
of studying and participating
in multiple social movements,

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.303
I've come to realize

00:00:14.303 --> 00:00:17.614
that the way technology
empowers social movements

00:00:17.614 --> 00:00:20.720
can also paradoxically help weaken them.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.604
This is not inevitable,
but overcoming it requires diving deep

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:28.897
into what makes success possible
over the long term.

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:31.458
And the lessons apply in multiple domains.

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:35.453
Now, take Turkey's
Gezi Park protests, July 2013,

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:38.490
which I went back to study in the field.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.943
Twitter was key to its organizing.

00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:44.337
It was everywhere in the park --
well, along with a lot of tear gas.

00:00:44.337 --> 00:00:46.175
It wasn't all high tech.

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:50.053
But the people in Turkey had already
gotten used to the power of Twitter

00:00:50.053 --> 00:00:53.993
because of an unfortunate incident
about a year before

00:00:53.994 --> 00:00:57.785
when military jets had bombed and killed

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:01.874
34 Kurdish smugglers
near the border region,

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:06.618
and Turkish media completely
censored this news.

00:01:06.618 --> 00:01:08.456
Editors sat in their newsrooms

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:11.355
and waited for the government
to tell them what to do.

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:13.955
One frustrated journalist
could not take this anymore.

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:15.645
He purchased his own plane ticket,

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:17.957
and went to the village
where this had occurred.

00:01:17.957 --> 00:01:20.623
And he was confronted by this scene:

00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:26.021
a line of coffins coming down a hill,
relatives wailing.

00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:28.462
He later he told me
how overwhelmed he felt,

00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:30.183
and didn't know what to do,

00:01:30.183 --> 00:01:32.156
so he took out his phone,

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:33.924
like any one of us might,

00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:37.122
and snapped that picture
and tweeted it out.

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:40.849
And voila, that picture went viral

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:45.237
and broke the censorship
and forced mass media to cover it.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:48.418
So when, a year later,
Turkey's Gezi protests happened,

00:01:48.418 --> 00:01:51.140
it started as a protest
about a park being razed,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.443
but became an anti-authoritarian protest.

00:01:53.443 --> 00:01:57.601
It wasn't surprising
that media also censored it,

00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.533
but it got a little ridiculous at times.

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.603
When things were so intense,

00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:06.998
when CNN International
was broadcasting live from Istanbul,

00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:13.348
CNN Turkey instead was broadcasting
a documentary on penguins.

00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:17.934
Now, I love penguin documentaries,
but that wasn't the news of the day.

00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:22.231
An angry viewer put his two screens
together and snapped that picture,

00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.098
and that one too went viral,

00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:28.586
and since then, people call Turkish media
the penguin media. (Laughter)

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:30.751
But this time, people knew what to do.

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:33.710
They just took out their phones
and looked for actual news.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.174
Better, they knew to go to the park
and take pictures and participate

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:40.125
and share it more on social media.

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:46.675
Digital connectivity was used
for everything from food to donations.

00:02:46.675 --> 00:02:51.947
Everything was organized partially
with the help of these new technologies.

00:02:51.947 --> 00:02:56.153
And using Internet to mobilize
and publicize protests

00:02:56.153 --> 00:02:58.609
actually goes back a long way.

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.454
Remember the Zapatistas,

00:03:00.454 --> 00:03:05.089
the peasant uprising
in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:10.720
led by the masked, pipe-smoking,
charismatic Subcomandante Marcos?

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.599
That was probably the first movement

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.970
that got global attention
thanks to the Internet.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.338
Or consider Seattle '99,

00:03:17.338 --> 00:03:22.141
when a multinational grassroots effort
brought global attention

00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:26.826
to what was then an obscure organization,
the World Trade Organization,

00:03:26.826 --> 00:03:31.367
by also utilizing these digital
technologies to help them organize.

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:33.902
And more recently, movement after movement

00:03:33.902 --> 00:03:36.740
has shaken country after country:

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.872
the Arab uprisings from Bahrain
to Tunisia to Egypt and more;

00:03:41.872 --> 00:03:46.744
indignados in Spain, Italy, Greece;
the Gezi Park protests;

00:03:46.744 --> 00:03:50.968
Taiwan; Euromaidan in Ukraine; Hong Kong.

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:55.680
And think of more recent initiatives,
like the #BringBackOurGirls hashtags.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.536
Nowadays, a network of tweets
can unleash a global awareness campaign.

00:04:02.536 --> 00:04:06.454
A Facebook page can become the hub
of a massive mobilization.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.224
Amazing.

00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:12.538
But think of the moments I just mentioned.

00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:17.203
The achievements they were
able to have, their outcomes,

00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:22.013
are not really proportional
to the size and energy they inspired.

00:04:22.013 --> 00:04:26.034
The hopes they rightfully raised
are not really matched

00:04:26.034 --> 00:04:30.502
by what they were able to have
as a result in the end.

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:32.914
And this raises a question:

00:04:34.204 --> 00:04:38.429
As digital technology makes things
easier for movements,

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:42.452
why haven't successful outcomes
become more likely as well?

00:04:42.452 --> 00:04:48.017
In embracing digital platforms
for activism and politics,

00:04:48.017 --> 00:04:52.251
are we overlooking some of the benefits
of doing things the hard way?

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:53.468
Now, I believe so.

00:04:53.468 --> 00:04:55.273
I believe that the rule of thumb is:

00:04:55.273 --> 00:05:00.000
Easier to mobilize does not always mean
easier to achieve gains.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.503
Now, to be clear,

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:06.357
technology does empower in multiple ways.

00:05:06.357 --> 00:05:07.817
It's very powerful.

00:05:07.817 --> 00:05:11.863
In Turkey, I watched
four young college students

00:05:11.863 --> 00:05:16.093
organize a countrywide citizen journalism
network called 140Journos

00:05:16.093 --> 00:05:20.524
that became the central hub
for uncensored news in the country.

00:05:20.524 --> 00:05:25.671
In Egypt, I saw another four young people
use digital connectivity

00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:29.518
to organize the supplies and logistics
for 10 field hospitals,

00:05:29.518 --> 00:05:31.529
very large operations,

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:36.530
during massive clashes
near Tahrir Square in 2011.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.217
And I asked the founder
of this effort, called Tahrir Supplies,

00:05:41.217 --> 00:05:47.327
how long it took him to go from when
he had the idea to when he got started.

00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:49.686
"Five minutes," he said. Five minutes.

00:05:49.686 --> 00:05:52.234
And he had no training
or background in logistics.

00:05:52.234 --> 00:05:55.957
Or think of the Occupy movement
which rocked the world in 2011.

00:05:55.957 --> 00:05:57.935
It started with a single email

00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:03.176
from a magazine, Adbusters,
to 90,000 subscribers in its list.

00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:06.160
About two months after that first email,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.509
there were in the United States
600 ongoing occupations and protests.

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:18.333
Less than one month after the first
physical occupation in Zuccotti Park,

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:25.174
a global protest was held
in about 82 countries, 950 cities.

00:06:25.174 --> 00:06:27.919
It was one of the largest
global protests ever organized.

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:34.606
Now, compare that to what the Civil Rights
Movement had to do in 1955 Alabama

00:06:34.606 --> 00:06:40.743
to protest the racially segregated
bus system, which they wanted to boycott.

00:06:40.743 --> 00:06:42.495
They'd been preparing for many years

00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:44.561
and decided it was time
to swing into action

00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:46.764
after Rosa Parks was arrested.

00:06:46.764 --> 00:06:48.430
But how do you get the word out --

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.593
tomorrow we're going to
start the boycott --

00:06:50.593 --> 00:06:56.001
when you don't have Facebook,
texting, Twitter, none of that?

00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:01.171
So they had to mimeograph 52,000 leaflets

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:04.364
by sneaking into a university
duplicating room

00:07:04.364 --> 00:07:06.905
and working all night, secretly.

00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:10.398
They then used the 68
African-American organizations

00:07:10.398 --> 00:07:14.365
that criss-crossed the city
to distribute those leaflets by hand.

00:07:14.365 --> 00:07:19.335
And the logistical tasks were daunting,
because these were poor people.

00:07:19.335 --> 00:07:21.425
They had to get to work, boycott or no,

00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:24.327
so a massive carpool was organized,

00:07:24.327 --> 00:07:26.443
again by meeting.

00:07:26.443 --> 00:07:28.838
No texting, no Twitter, no Facebook.

00:07:28.838 --> 00:07:32.407
They had to meet almost all the time
to keep this carpool going.

00:07:32.407 --> 00:07:34.679
Today, it would be so much easier.

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:39.667
We could create a database,
available rides and what rides you need,

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:42.949
have the database coordinate,
and use texting.

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:45.503
We wouldn't have to meet all that much.

00:07:45.503 --> 00:07:47.779
But again, consider this:

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.773
the Civil Rights Movement
in the United States

00:07:50.773 --> 00:07:55.267
navigated a minefield
of political dangers,

00:07:55.267 --> 00:08:00.770
faced repression and overcame,
won major policy concessions,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.006
navigated and innovated through risks.

00:08:04.006 --> 00:08:07.539
In contrast, three years
after Occupy sparked

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:10.145
that global conversation about inequality,

00:08:10.145 --> 00:08:13.970
the policies that fueled it
are still in place.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.115
Europe was also rocked
by anti-austerity protests,

00:08:17.115 --> 00:08:21.237
but the continent
didn't shift its direction.

00:08:21.237 --> 00:08:24.173
In embracing these technologies,

00:08:24.173 --> 00:08:30.581
are we overlooking some of the benefits
of slow and sustained?

00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:32.450
To understand this,

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.573
I went back to Turkey
about a year after the Gezi protests

00:08:35.573 --> 00:08:37.850
and I interviewed a range of people,

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.557
from activists to politicians,

00:08:41.557 --> 00:08:46.174
from both the ruling party
and the opposition party and movements.

00:08:46.174 --> 00:08:49.480
I found that the Gezi protesters
were despairing.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.511
They were frustrated,

00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:54.567
and they had achieved much less
than what they had hoped for.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:57.105
This echoed what I'd been hearing
around the world

00:08:57.105 --> 00:09:00.891
from many other protesters
that I'm in touch with.

00:09:00.891 --> 00:09:03.198
And I've come to realize
that part of the problem

00:09:03.198 --> 00:09:09.067
is that today's protests have become
a bit like climbing Mt. Everest

00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:11.524
with the help of 60 Sherpas,

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:14.651
and the Internet is our Sherpa.

00:09:14.651 --> 00:09:18.964
What we're doing is taking the fast routes

00:09:18.964 --> 00:09:22.303
and not replacing the benefits
of the slower work.

00:09:22.303 --> 00:09:23.999
Because, you see,

00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:26.867
the kind of work that went into organizing

00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:29.650
all those daunting,
tedious logistical tasks

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.279
did not just take care of those tasks,

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:36.954
they also created the kind of organization
that could think together collectively

00:09:36.963 --> 00:09:39.238
and make hard decisions together,

00:09:39.238 --> 00:09:43.175
create consensus and innovate,
and maybe even more crucially,

00:09:43.175 --> 00:09:46.542
keep going together through differences.

00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:51.330
So when you see this
March on Washington in 1963,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.014
when you look at that picture,

00:09:53.014 --> 00:09:56.355
where this is the march where
Martin Luther King gave his famous

00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:59.207
"I have a dream" speech, 1963,

00:09:59.207 --> 00:10:03.649
you don't just see a march
and you don't just hear a powerful speech,

00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:09.122
you also see the painstaking,
long-term work that can put on that march.

00:10:09.122 --> 00:10:10.917
And if you're in power,

00:10:10.917 --> 00:10:15.216
you realize you have to take
the capacity signaled by that march,

00:10:15.218 --> 00:10:19.724
not just the march, but the capacity
signaled by that march, seriously.

00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:23.727
In contrast, when you look
at Occupy's global marches

00:10:23.727 --> 00:10:25.369
that were organized in two weeks,

00:10:25.369 --> 00:10:26.753
you see a lot of discontent,

00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:30.907
but you don't necessarily see teeth that
can bite over the long term.

00:10:31.617 --> 00:10:35.710
And crucially, the Civil Rights Movement
innovated tactically

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:42.496
from boycotts to lunch counter sit-ins
to pickets to marches to freedom rides.

00:10:42.496 --> 00:10:46.311
Today's movements scale up very quickly
without the organizational base

00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:48.900
that can see them through the challenges.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.700
They feel a little like startups
that got very big

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.705
without knowing what to do next,

00:10:54.705 --> 00:10:57.362
and they rarely manage to shift tactically

00:10:57.362 --> 00:10:59.859
because they don't have
the depth of capacity

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:02.151
to weather such transitions.

00:11:02.151 --> 00:11:06.858
Now, I want to be clear:
The magic is not in the mimeograph.

00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:13.489
It's in that capacity to work together,
think together collectively,

00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:16.671
which can only be built
over time with a lot of work.

00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:18.747
To understand all this,

00:11:18.747 --> 00:11:22.571
I interviewed a top official
from the ruling party in Turkey,

00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:24.739
and I ask him, "How do you do it?"

00:11:24.739 --> 00:11:28.442
They too use digital technology
extensively, so that's not it.

00:11:28.442 --> 00:11:30.372
So what's the secret?

00:11:30.372 --> 00:11:31.896
Well, he told me.

00:11:31.896 --> 00:11:38.532
He said the key is
he never took sugar with his tea.

00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:41.593
I said, what has that
got to do with anything?

00:11:41.593 --> 00:11:44.759
Well, he said, his party starts
getting ready for the next election

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:46.300
the day after the last one,

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.281
and he spends all day every day
meeting with voters in their homes,

00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:52.863
in their wedding parties,
circumcision ceremonies,

00:11:52.863 --> 00:11:55.818
and then he meets with his colleagues
to compare notes.

00:11:55.818 --> 00:12:00.384
With that many meetings every day,
with tea offered at every one of them,

00:12:00.384 --> 00:12:03.736
which he could not refuse,
because that would be rude,

00:12:03.736 --> 00:12:08.379
he could not take even one cube of sugar
per cup of tea,

00:12:08.379 --> 00:12:12.335
because that would be many kilos of sugar,
he can't even calculate how many kilos,

00:12:12.335 --> 00:12:15.979
and at that point I realized
why he was speaking so fast.

00:12:15.979 --> 00:12:19.230
We had met in the afternoon,
and he was already way over-caffeinated.

00:12:20.527 --> 00:12:25.000
But his party won two major elections

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.658
within a year of the Gezi protests
with comfortable margins.

00:12:28.658 --> 00:12:31.997
To be sure, governments have
different resources to bring to the table.

00:12:31.997 --> 00:12:35.147
It's not the same game,
but the differences are instructive.

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:39.009
And like all such stories, this is not
a story just of technology.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:44.091
It's what technology allows us to do
converging with what we want to do.

00:12:44.091 --> 00:12:47.877
Today's social movements
want to operate informally.

00:12:47.877 --> 00:12:50.147
They do not want institutional leadership.

00:12:50.147 --> 00:12:55.013
They want to stay out of politics because
they fear corruption and cooptation.

00:12:55.013 --> 00:12:56.546
They have a point.

00:12:56.546 --> 00:12:59.961
Modern representative democracies
are being strangled in many countries

00:12:59.961 --> 00:13:01.604
by powerful interests.

00:13:02.244 --> 00:13:05.518
But operating this way
makes it hard for them

00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:09.268
to sustain over the long term
and exert leverage over the system,

00:13:09.268 --> 00:13:12.530
which leads to frustrated
protesters dropping out,

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.889
and even more corrupt politics.

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:20.977
And politics and democracy
without an effective challenge hobbles,

00:13:20.977 --> 00:13:27.370
because the causes that have inspired
the modern recent movements are crucial.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.465
Climate change is barreling towards us.

00:13:30.465 --> 00:13:35.348
Inequality is stifling human growth
and potential and economies.

00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:37.633
Authoritarianism is choking
many countries.

00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:40.384
We need movements to be more effective.

00:13:40.384 --> 00:13:43.062
Now, some people have argued
that the problem is

00:13:43.062 --> 00:13:49.521
today's movements are not formed of people
who take as many risks as before,

00:13:49.521 --> 00:13:51.569
and that is not true.

00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:54.131
From Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere,

00:13:54.131 --> 00:13:57.769
I've seen people put their lives
and livelihoods on the line.

00:13:57.769 --> 00:14:00.188
It's also not true,
as Malcolm Gladwell claimed,

00:14:00.188 --> 00:14:02.930
that today's protesters
form weaker virtual ties.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:06.721
No, they come to these protests,
just like before,

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:09.333
with their friends, existing networks,

00:14:09.333 --> 00:14:11.635
and sometimes they do
make new friends for life.

00:14:11.635 --> 00:14:14.221
I still see the friends that I made

00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:17.643
in those Zapatista-convened
global protests more than a decade ago,

00:14:17.643 --> 00:14:20.615
and the bonds between strangers
are not worthless.

00:14:20.615 --> 00:14:22.899
When I got tear-gassed in Gezi,

00:14:22.899 --> 00:14:28.171
people I didn't know helped me
and one another instead of running away.

00:14:28.171 --> 00:14:31.398
In Tahrir, I saw people, protesters,

00:14:31.398 --> 00:14:34.208
working really hard to keep
each other safe and protected.

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:36.097
And digital awareness-raising is great,

00:14:36.097 --> 00:14:39.816
because changing minds
is the bedrock of changing politics.

00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:47.216
But movements today have to move beyond
participation at great scale very fast

00:14:47.216 --> 00:14:50.715
and figure out how
to think together collectively,

00:14:50.715 --> 00:14:54.456
develop strong policy proposals,
create consensus,

00:14:54.456 --> 00:14:58.130
figure out the political steps
and relate them to leverage,

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.813
because all these good intentions
and bravery and sacrifice by itself

00:15:01.813 --> 00:15:03.485
are not going to be enough.

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:05.381
And there are many efforts.

00:15:05.381 --> 00:15:09.770
In New Zealand, a group of young people
are developing a platform called Loomio

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.771
for participatory
decision making at scale.

00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:16.046
In Turkey, 140Journos
are holding hack-a-thons

00:15:16.046 --> 00:15:19.879
so that they support communities
as well as citizen journalism.

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:23.725
In Argentina, an open-source platform
called DemocracyOS

00:15:23.725 --> 00:15:27.133
is bringing participation
to parliaments and political parties.

00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:30.518
These are all great, and we need more,

00:15:30.518 --> 00:15:34.694
but the answer won't just be
better online decision-making,

00:15:34.694 --> 00:15:40.247
because to update democracy, we are going
to need to innovate at every level,

00:15:40.247 --> 00:15:44.740
from the organizational
to the political to the social.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.692
Because to succeed over the long term,

00:15:48.692 --> 00:15:51.064
sometimes you do need tea without sugar

00:15:51.064 --> 00:15:52.697
along with your Twitter.

00:15:52.697 --> 00:15:54.209
Thank you.

00:15:54.209 --> 00:16:01.010
(Applause)
