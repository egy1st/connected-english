00:00:00.697 --> 00:00:05.383
When I was invited to give this talk 
a couple of months ago,

00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:08.893
we discussed a number 
of titles with the organizers,

00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:12.308
and a lot of different items were 
kicked around and were discussed.

00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:14.349
But nobody suggested this one,

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.278
and the reason for that
was two months ago,

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:20.190
Ebola was escalating exponentially

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.553
and spreading over wider geographic areas
than we had ever seen,

00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:27.822
and the world was terrified, 
concerned and alarmed

00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:32.790
by this disease, in a way we've not 
seen in recent history.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.960
But today, I can stand here 
and I can talk to you about beating Ebola

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.651
because of people 
whom you've never heard of,

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:49.815
people like Peter Clement, a Liberian 
doctor who's working in Lofa County,

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:55.294
a place that many of you have 
never heard of, probably, in Liberia.

00:00:55.294 --> 00:00:57.684
The reason that Lofa County 
is so important

00:00:57.684 --> 00:01:00.115
is because about five months ago,

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:04.533
when the epidemic was 
just starting to escalate,

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:09.477
Lofa County was right at the center, 
the epicenter of this epidemic.

00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:13.222
At that time, MSF
and the treatment center there,

00:01:13.222 --> 00:01:16.097
they were seeing dozens of patients 
every single day,

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:20.345
and these patients, these communities
were becoming more and more terrified

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:24.713
as time went by, with this disease 
and what it was doing to their families,

00:01:24.713 --> 00:01:28.329
to their communities, 
to their children, to their relatives.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.092
And so Peter Clement was charged with 
driving that 12-hour-long rough road

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:37.339
from Monrovia, the capital,
up to Lofa County,

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:41.701
to try and help bring control
to the escalating epidemic there.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:47.063
And what Peter found when he arrived was
the terror that I just mentioned to you.

00:01:47.063 --> 00:01:51.304
So he sat down with the local chiefs, 
and he listened.

00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:54.945
And what he heard was heartbreaking.

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:59.279
He heard about the devastation 
and the desperation

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:02.578
of people affected by this disease.

00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:04.656
He heard the heartbreaking stories

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:08.103
about not just the damage
that Ebola did to people,

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:11.299
but what it did to families 
and what it did to communities.

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:16.999
And he listened to the local chiefs there
and what they told him --

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.443
They said, "When our children are sick, 
when our children are dying,

00:02:20.443 --> 00:02:24.247
we can't hold them at a time when 
we want to be closest to them.

00:02:24.247 --> 00:02:28.937
When our relatives die, we can't take care
of them as our tradition demands.

00:02:28.937 --> 00:02:31.617
We are not allowed to wash 
the bodies to bury them

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:34.801
the way our communities and 
our rituals demand.

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:38.208
And for this reason, they were
deeply disturbed, deeply alarmed

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:41.995
and the entire epidemic 
was unraveling in front of them.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.911
People were turning on the healthcare 
workers who had come,

00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:48.265
the heroes who had come to try 
and help save the community,

00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:53.184
to help work with the community,
and they were unable to access them.

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:58.402
And what happened then was 
Peter explained to the leaders.

00:02:58.402 --> 00:03:01.137
The leaders listened. 
They turned the tables.

00:03:01.137 --> 00:03:04.744
And Peter explained what Ebola was.
He explained what the disease was.

00:03:04.744 --> 00:03:07.019
He explained what it did
to their communities.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.177
And he explained that Ebola threatened 
everything that made us human.

00:03:12.177 --> 00:03:16.563
Ebola means you can't hold your children
the way you would in this situation.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.873
You can't bury your dead 
the way that you would.

00:03:18.873 --> 00:03:23.516
You have to trust these people 
in these space suits to do that for you.

00:03:23.516 --> 00:03:26.865
And ladies and gentlemen, what 
happened then was rather extraordinary:

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:30.111
The community and the health workers, 
Peter, they sat down together

00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:35.168
and they put together a new plan 
for controlling Ebola in Lofa County.

00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:39.642
And the reason that this is such 
an important story, ladies and gentlemen,

00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:44.736
is because today, this county, which is 
right at the center of this epidemic

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:47.563
you've been watching, 
you've been seeing in the newspapers,

00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:51.306
you've been seeing on 
the television screens,

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:57.393
today Lofa County is nearly eight weeks
without seeing a single case of Ebola.

00:03:57.393 --> 00:04:04.439
(Applause)

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.872
Now, this doesn't mean that 
the job is done, obviously.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:11.128
There's still a huge risk
that there will be additional cases there.

00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:14.392
But what it does teach us 
is that Ebola can be beaten.

00:04:14.392 --> 00:04:16.049
That's the key thing.

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.216
Even on this scale,

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:21.113
even with the rapid kind of growth
that we saw in this environment here,

00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:24.571
we now know Ebola can be beaten.

00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:28.562
When communities come together 
with health care workers, work together,

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:31.235
that's when this disease can be stopped.

00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:34.885
But how did Ebola end up
in Lofa County in the first place?

00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:39.577
Well, for that, we have to go back 
12 months, to the start of this epidemic.

00:04:39.577 --> 00:04:42.828
And as many of you know, 
this virus went undetected,

00:04:42.828 --> 00:04:46.803
it evaded detection for three 
or four months when it began.

00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:49.466
That's because this is not 
a disease of West Africa,

00:04:49.466 --> 00:04:52.611
it's a disease of Central Africa, 
half a continent away.

00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:54.547
People hadn't seen the disease before;

00:04:54.547 --> 00:04:57.156
health workers hadn't seen 
the disease before.

00:04:57.156 --> 00:04:59.324
They didn't know what 
they were dealing with,

00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:01.383
and to make it 
even more complicated,

00:05:01.383 --> 00:05:05.951
the virus itself was causing a symptom,
a type of a presentation

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:08.216
that wasn't classical of the disease.

00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:12.631
So people didn't even recognize 
the disease, people who knew Ebola.

00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:16.490
For that reason it evaded detection 
for some time,

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.660
But contrary to public belief 
sometimes these days,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.175
once the virus was detected, 
there was a rapid surge in of support.

00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:30.236
MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment 
center, as many of you know, in the area.

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:33.330
The World Health Organization
and the partners that it works with

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.005
deployed eventually hundreds of people 
over the next two months

00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:39.393
to be able to help track the virus.

00:05:39.393 --> 00:05:43.424
The problem, ladies and gentlemen,
is by then, this virus,

00:05:43.424 --> 00:05:46.977
well known now as Ebola, 
had spread too far.

00:05:46.977 --> 00:05:50.186
It had already outstripped what was 
one of the largest responses

00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:53.995
that had been mounted so far
to an Ebola outbreak.

00:05:53.995 --> 00:05:56.403
By the middle of the year,
not just Guinea

00:05:56.403 --> 00:06:00.366
but now Sierra Leone and Liberia
were also infected.

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:05.233
As the virus was spreading geographically,
the numbers were increasing

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:10.289
and at this time, not only were 
hundreds of people infected

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.168
and dying of the disease,

00:06:12.168 --> 00:06:14.907
but as importantly,
the front line responders,

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:17.750
the people who had gone to try and help,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.892
the health care workers, the other 
responders

00:06:20.892 --> 00:06:23.498
were also sick and dying by the dozens.

00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:26.882
The presidents of these countries 
recognized the emergencies.

00:06:26.882 --> 00:06:30.422
They met right around that time, 
they agreed on common action

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:34.640
and they put together an emergency 
joint operation center in Conakry

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.960
to try and work together to finish this
disease and get it stopped,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.712
to implement the strategies
we talked about.

00:06:42.242 --> 00:06:46.199
But what happened then was something 
we had never seen before with Ebola.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.785
What happened then was the virus, 
or someone sick with the virus,

00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:53.181
boarded an airplane, 
flew to another country,

00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:57.323
and for the first time,
we saw in another distant country

00:06:57.323 --> 00:06:59.879
the virus pop up again.

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:04.286
This time it was in Nigeria,
in the teeming metropolis of Lagos,

00:07:04.286 --> 00:07:06.245
21 million people.

00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:09.228
Now the virus was in that environment.

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:12.768
And as you can anticipate, 
there was international alarm,

00:07:12.768 --> 00:07:16.536
international concern on a scale that 
we hadn't seen in recent years

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:18.990
caused by a disease like this.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.630
The World Health Organization immediately 
called together an expert panel,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.251
looked at the situation, 
declared an international emergency.

00:07:27.256 --> 00:07:32.346
And in doing so, the expectation would be
that there would be a huge outpouring

00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:35.316
of international assistance
to help these countries

00:07:35.316 --> 00:07:39.034
which were in so much trouble
and concern at that time.

00:07:39.364 --> 00:07:42.111
But what we saw was 
something very different.

00:07:42.341 --> 00:07:45.869
There was some great response.

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:50.630
A number of countries came to assist --
many, many NGOs and others, as you know,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.046
but at the same time, the opposite 
happened in many places.

00:07:54.046 --> 00:07:58.161
Alarm escalated, and very soon 
these countries found themselves

00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:02.556
not receiving the support they needed,
but increasingly isolated.

00:08:02.556 --> 00:08:07.290
What we saw was commercial airlines
[stopped] flying into these countries

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.881
and people who hadn't even been
exposed to the virus

00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:12.043
were no longer allowed to travel.

00:08:12.043 --> 00:08:15.971
This caused not only problems, obviously, 
for the countries themselves,

00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:18.093
but also for the response.

00:08:18.093 --> 00:08:21.055
Those organizations that were 
trying to bring people in,

00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:23.261
to try and help them
respond to the outbreak,

00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:25.193
they could not get 
people on airplanes,

00:08:25.193 --> 00:08:28.392
they could not get them into the 
countries to be able to respond.

00:08:28.392 --> 00:08:30.404
In that situation,
ladies and gentleman,

00:08:30.404 --> 00:08:33.639
a virus like Ebola takes advantage.

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:38.577
And what we saw then was something 
also we hadn't seen before.

00:08:38.577 --> 00:08:41.733
Not only did this virus 
continue in the places

00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:45.324
where they'd already become infected,
but then it started to escalate

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:47.692
and we saw the case numbers
that you see here,

00:08:47.692 --> 00:08:50.746
something we'd never seen before
on such a scale,

00:08:50.746 --> 00:08:53.783
an exponential increase of Ebola cases

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:58.024
not just in these countries or the areas 
already infected in these countries

00:08:58.024 --> 00:09:01.883
but also spreading further and 
deeper into these countries.

00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:04.947
Ladies and gentleman,
this was one of the most concerning

00:09:04.947 --> 00:09:09.772
international emergencies in public health
we've ever seen.

00:09:10.502 --> 00:09:12.553
And what happened in these countries then,

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:16.742
many of you saw, again, on the television,
read about in the newspapers,

00:09:16.742 --> 00:09:22.102
we saw the health system start to collapse
under the weight of this epidemic.

00:09:22.102 --> 00:09:26.722
We saw the schools begin to close, 
markets no longer started,

00:09:26.722 --> 00:09:30.042
no longer functioned the way 
that they should in these countries.

00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:34.161
We saw that misinformation and 
misperceptions started to spread

00:09:34.161 --> 00:09:37.645
even faster through the communities,
which became even more alarmed

00:09:37.645 --> 00:09:39.260
about the situation.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.844
They started to recoil from those people 
that you saw in those space suits,

00:09:42.844 --> 00:09:45.091
as they call them, 
who had come to help them.

00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:48.118
And then the situation
deteriorated even further.

00:09:48.118 --> 00:09:50.800
The countries had to declare
a state of emergency.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.205
Large populations needed to be quarantined
in some areas, and then riots broke out.

00:09:56.205 --> 00:09:59.975
It was a very, very terrifying situation.

00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:02.834
Around the world,
many people began to ask,

00:10:02.834 --> 00:10:06.803
can we ever stop Ebola 
when it starts to spread like this?

00:10:06.803 --> 00:10:11.255
And they started to ask, how well 
do we really know this virus?

00:10:11.585 --> 00:10:14.740
The reality is we don't know 
Ebola extremely well.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.735
It's a relatively modern disease
in terms of what we know about it.

00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:21.020
We've known the disease only for 40 years,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.502
since it first popped up
in Central Africa in 1976.

00:10:24.502 --> 00:10:27.582
But despite that, we do know many things:

00:10:27.582 --> 00:10:31.805
We know that this virus
probably survives in a type of a bat.

00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:34.921
We know that it probably enters 
a human population

00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:37.528
when we come in contact with a wild animal

00:10:37.528 --> 00:10:41.086
that has been infected with the virus 
and probably sickened by it.

00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:44.307
Then we know that the virus
spreads from person to person

00:10:44.307 --> 00:10:46.580
through contaminated body fluids.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.071
And as you've all seen,

00:10:48.071 --> 00:10:51.553
we know the horrific disease
that it then causes in humans,

00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:56.071
where we see this disease cause
severe fevers, diarrhea, vomiting,

00:10:56.071 --> 00:11:02.541
and then unfortunately, in 70 percent
of the cases or often more, death.

00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:07.884
This is a very dangerous,
debilitating, and deadly disease.

00:11:08.344 --> 00:11:12.517
But despite the fact that we've not known
this disease for a particularly long time,

00:11:12.517 --> 00:11:17.394
and we don't know everything about it,
we do know how to stop this disease.

00:11:17.394 --> 00:11:20.608
There are four things
that are critical to stopping Ebola.

00:11:20.608 --> 00:11:24.922
First and foremost, the communities 
have got to understand this disease,

00:11:24.922 --> 00:11:28.443
they've got to understand 
how it spreads and how to stop it.

00:11:28.443 --> 00:11:32.519
And then we've got to be able to have 
systems that can find every single case,

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:34.525
every contact of those cases,

00:11:34.525 --> 00:11:38.682
and begin to track the transmission chains
so that you can stop transmission.

00:11:38.682 --> 00:11:42.304
We have to have treatment centers,
specialized Ebola treatment centers,

00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:44.817
where the workers can be protected

00:11:44.817 --> 00:11:49.689
as they try to provide support
to the people who are infected,

00:11:49.689 --> 00:11:52.134
so that they might survive the disease.

00:11:52.134 --> 00:11:54.334
And then for those who do die,

00:11:54.334 --> 00:12:00.192
we have to ensure there is a safe, but at
the same time dignified, burial process,

00:12:00.192 --> 00:12:04.088
so that there is no spread 
at that time as well.

00:12:04.798 --> 00:12:09.299
So we do know how to stop Ebola, and these
strategies work, ladies and gentlemen.

00:12:09.299 --> 00:12:13.458
The virus was stopped in Nigeria 
by these four strategies

00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:15.562
and the people implementing 
them, obviously.

00:12:15.562 --> 00:12:19.584
It was stopped in Senegal, where it had
spread, and also in the other countries

00:12:19.584 --> 00:12:23.177
that were affected by this virus, 
in this outbreak.

00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:27.018
So there's no question that 
these strategies actually work.

00:12:27.018 --> 00:12:32.326
The big question, ladies and gentlemen,
was whether these strategies could work

00:12:32.326 --> 00:12:36.600
on this scale, in this situation,
with so many countries affected

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.206
with the kind of exponential 
growth that you saw.

00:12:40.206 --> 00:12:44.757
That was the big question that we were 
facing just two or three months ago.

00:12:44.757 --> 00:12:48.801
Today we know the answer to that question.

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:51.779
And we know that answer 
because of the extraordinary work

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:56.546
of an incredible group of NGOs,
of governments, of local leaders,

00:12:56.546 --> 00:13:00.932
of U.N. agencies and many humanitarian 
and other organizations

00:13:00.932 --> 00:13:04.850
that came and joined the fight
to try and stop Ebola in West Africa.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.293
But what had to be done there 
was slightly different.

00:13:08.293 --> 00:13:11.218
These countries took those strategies 
I just showed you;

00:13:11.218 --> 00:13:16.624
the community engagement,
the case finding, contact tracing, etc.,

00:13:16.624 --> 00:13:18.548
and they turned them on their head.

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:21.481
There was so much disease,
they approached it differently.

00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:26.912
What they decided to do was they would 
first try and slow down this epidemic

00:13:26.912 --> 00:13:31.899
by rapidly building as many beds as
possible in specialized treatment centers

00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:37.203
so that they could prevent the disease
from spreading from those were infected.

00:13:37.203 --> 00:13:39.652
They would rapidly build out
many, many burial teams

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.827
so that they could safely
deal with the dead,

00:13:41.827 --> 00:13:44.394
and with that, they would try 
and slow this outbreak

00:13:44.394 --> 00:13:48.613
to see if it could actually then 
be controlled using the classic approach

00:13:48.613 --> 00:13:51.364
of case finding and contact tracing.

00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:54.657
And when I went to West Africa
about three months ago,

00:13:54.657 --> 00:13:57.669
when I was there
what I saw was extraordinary.

00:13:57.669 --> 00:14:02.595
I saw presidents opening emergency
operation centers themselves against Ebola

00:14:02.595 --> 00:14:06.363
so that they could personally coordinate 
and oversee and champion

00:14:06.363 --> 00:14:10.450
this surge of international support 
to try and stop this disease.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.001
We saw militaries from within 
those countries and from far beyond

00:14:14.001 --> 00:14:16.741
coming in to help build 
Ebola treatment centers

00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:19.991
that could be used to isolate 
those who were sick.

00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:24.417
We saw the Red Cross movement working with
its partner agencies on the ground there

00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:29.574
to help train the communities so that
they could actually safely bury their dead

00:14:29.574 --> 00:14:32.132
in a dignified manner themselves.

00:14:32.132 --> 00:14:34.933
And we saw the U.N. agencies, 
the World Food Program,

00:14:34.933 --> 00:14:36.834
build a tremendous air bridge

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:40.736
that could get responders to every single
corner of these countries rapidly

00:14:40.736 --> 00:14:44.089
to be able to implement the strategies
that we just talked about.

00:14:44.089 --> 00:14:47.434
What we saw, ladies and gentlemen, 
which was probably most impressive,

00:14:47.434 --> 00:14:50.451
was this incredible work
by the governments,

00:14:50.451 --> 00:14:53.468
by the leaders in these countries,
with the communities,

00:14:53.468 --> 00:14:56.486
to try to ensure people 
understood this disease,

00:14:56.486 --> 00:15:02.169
understood the extraordinary things they 
would have to do to try and stop Ebola.

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:04.462
And as a result, ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:04.462 --> 00:15:08.905
we saw something that we did not know
only two or three months earlier,

00:15:08.905 --> 00:15:11.179
whether or not it would be possible.

00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:14.309
What we saw was 
what you see now in this graph,

00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:17.118
when we took stock on December 1.

00:15:17.118 --> 00:15:20.560
What we saw was we could 
bend that curve, so to speak,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.934
change this exponential growth,

00:15:22.934 --> 00:15:27.163
and bring some hope back
to the ability to control this outbreak.

00:15:27.163 --> 00:15:31.217
And for this reason, ladies and gentlemen,
there's absolutely no question now

00:15:31.217 --> 00:15:37.018
that we can catch up with this outbreak 
in West Africa and we can beat Ebola.

00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:40.958
The big question, though, 
that many people are asking,

00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.941
even when they saw this curve, they said,

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:45.845
"Well, hang on a minute --
that's great you can slow it down,

00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:47.896
but can you actually
drive it down to zero?"

00:15:47.896 --> 00:15:51.437
We already answered that question 
back at the beginning of this talk,

00:15:51.437 --> 00:15:55.590
when I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:59.016
We told you the story
how Lofa County got to a situation

00:15:59.016 --> 00:16:01.829
where they have not seen
Ebola for eight weeks.

00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:05.205
But there are similar stories from 
the other countries as well.

00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:07.451
From Gueckedou in Guinea,

00:16:07.451 --> 00:16:11.959
the first area where the first case was
actually diagnosed.

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:15.373
We've seen very, very few cases
in the last couple of months,

00:16:15.373 --> 00:16:19.800
and here in Kenema, in Sierra Leone, 
another area in the epicenter,

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.061
we have not seen the virus
for more than a couple of weeks --

00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:26.156
way too early to declare 
victory, obviously,

00:16:26.156 --> 00:16:27.931
but evidence, ladies and gentlemen,

00:16:27.931 --> 00:16:31.556
not only can the response 
catch up to the disease,

00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:34.722
but this disease can be driven to zero.

00:16:34.722 --> 00:16:38.878
The challenge now, of course, 
is doing this on the scale needed

00:16:38.878 --> 00:16:44.244
right across these three countries,
and that is a huge challenge.

00:16:44.244 --> 00:16:48.949
Because when you've been at something
for this long, on this scale,

00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:52.949
two other big threats 
come in to join the virus.

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:56.052
The first of those is complacency,

00:16:56.052 --> 00:16:59.475
the risk that as this 
disease curve starts to bend,

00:16:59.475 --> 00:17:02.739
the media look elsewhere, 
the world looks elsewhere.

00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:04.371
Complacency always a risk.

00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:08.714
And the other risk, of course, is when
you've been working so hard for so long,

00:17:08.714 --> 00:17:12.352
and slept so few hours 
over the past months,

00:17:12.352 --> 00:17:14.590
people are tired, people become fatigued,

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:18.660
and these new risks 
start to creep into the response.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.940
Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you today
I've just come back from West Africa.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.640
The people of these countries,
the leaders of these countries,

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.136
they are not complacent.

00:17:28.136 --> 00:17:31.879
They want to drive Ebola to zero 
in their countries.

00:17:31.879 --> 00:17:35.664
And these people, yes, they're tired, 
but they are not fatigued.

00:17:35.664 --> 00:17:37.869
They have an energy, they have a courage,

00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:40.399
they have the strength 
to get this finished.

00:17:40.399 --> 00:17:43.153
What they need, ladies
and gentlemen, at this point,

00:17:43.153 --> 00:17:46.781
is the unwavering support of the 
international community,

00:17:46.781 --> 00:17:48.189
to stand with them,

00:17:48.189 --> 00:17:53.047
to bolster and bring even more support 
at this time, to get the job finished.

00:17:53.047 --> 00:17:58.082
Because finishing Ebola right now 
means turning the tables on this virus,

00:17:58.082 --> 00:17:59.817
and beginning to hunt it.

00:17:59.817 --> 00:18:05.004
Remember, this virus, this whole crisis, 
rather, started with one case,

00:18:05.004 --> 00:18:07.703
and is going to finish with one case.

00:18:07.703 --> 00:18:12.027
But it will only finish if those countries
have got enough epidemiologists,

00:18:12.027 --> 00:18:16.644
enough health workers, enough logisticians
and enough other people working with them

00:18:16.644 --> 00:18:20.126
to be able to find every one 
of those cases, track their contacts

00:18:20.126 --> 00:18:24.220
and make sure that this disease 
stops once and for all.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.557
Ladies and gentleman, Ebola can be beaten.

00:18:27.557 --> 00:18:32.245
Now we need you to take this story out
to tell it to the people who will listen

00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:35.457
and educate them 
on what it means to beat Ebola,

00:18:35.457 --> 00:18:39.189
and more importantly,
we need you to advocate with the people

00:18:39.189 --> 00:18:42.743
who can help us bring the resources we
need to these countries,

00:18:42.743 --> 00:18:44.517
to beat this disease.

00:18:44.517 --> 00:18:48.699
There are a lot of people out there 
who will survive and will thrive,

00:18:48.699 --> 00:18:52.101
in part because of what you do 
to help us beat Ebola.

00:18:52.101 --> 00:18:53.587
Thank you.

00:18:53.587 --> 00:18:57.474
(Applause)
