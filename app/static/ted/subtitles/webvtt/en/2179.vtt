00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.731
Some years ago,

00:00:01.731 --> 00:00:05.175
I stumbled across a simple design exercise

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:08.780
that helps people understand
and solve complex problems,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.867
and like many of these design exercises,
it kind of seems trivial at first,

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:14.611
but under deep inspection,

00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.331
it turns out that it reveals
unexpected truths

00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:20.662
about the way that we collaborate
and make sense of things.

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:22.264
The exercise has three parts

00:00:22.264 --> 00:00:24.749
and begins with something
that we all know how to do,

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.149
which is how to make toast.

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.809
It begins with a clean sheet of paper,
a felt marker,

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.940
and without using any words,
you begin to draw how to make toast.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.118
And most people draw something like this.

00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:40.498
They draw a loaf of bread, 
which is sliced, then put into a toaster.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:42.744
The toast is then deposited for some time.

00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:48.295
It pops up, and then voila!
After two minutes, toast and happiness.

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:53.643
Now, over the years, I've collected
many hundreds of drawings of these toasts,

00:00:53.643 --> 00:00:55.403
and some of them are very good,

00:00:55.403 --> 00:00:58.869
because they really illustrate
the toast-making process quite clearly.

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:02.166
And then there are some that are,
well, not so good.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:07.344
They really suck, actually, because
you don't know what they're trying to say.

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:09.271
Under close inspection,

00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:12.754
some reveal some aspects of toast-making
while hiding others.

00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:15.424
So there's some
that are all about the toast,

00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:18.164
and all about the transformation of toast.

00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:20.764
And there's others
that are all about the toaster,

00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:24.094
and the engineers love to draw
the mechanics of this.

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:25.504
(Laughter)

00:01:25.504 --> 00:01:27.875
And then there are others
that are about people.

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:31.723
It's about visualizing
the experience that people have.

00:01:31.723 --> 00:01:35.236
And then there are others that are about
the supply chain of making toast

00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:37.226
that goes all the way back to the store.

00:01:37.226 --> 00:01:40.663
It goes through the supply chain
networks of teleportation

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:43.890
and all the way back
to the field and wheat,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.700
and one all actually goes
all the way back to the Big Bang.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.904
So it's crazy stuff.

00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:50.757
But I think it's obvious

00:01:50.757 --> 00:01:54.263
that even though these drawings
are really wildly different,

00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:57.366
they share a common quality,
and I'm wondering if you can see it.

00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.743
Do you see it? What's common about these?

00:01:59.743 --> 00:02:03.118
Most drawings have nodes and links.

00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:08.468
So nodes represent the tangible objects
like the toaster and people,

00:02:08.468 --> 00:02:11.974
and links represent
the connections between the nodes.

00:02:11.974 --> 00:02:14.807
And it's the combination
of links and nodes

00:02:14.807 --> 00:02:16.920
that produces a full systems model,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.845
and it makes our private
mental models visible

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:22.878
about how we think something works.

00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:24.709
So that's the value of these things.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.817
What's interesting about
these systems models

00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:29.002
is how they reveal
our various points of view.

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:32.623
So for example, Americans
make toast with a toaster.

00:02:32.623 --> 00:02:34.144
That seems obvious.

00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:38.114
Whereas many Europeans
make toast with a frying pan, of course,

00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:42.391
and many students make toast with a fire.

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.610
I don't really understand this.
A lot of MBA students do this.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.375
So you can measure the complexity
by counting the number of nodes,

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:53.297
and the average illustration
has between four and eight nodes.

00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:56.292
Less than that, the drawing seems trivial,

00:02:56.292 --> 00:02:58.545
but it's quick to understand,

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:03.618
and more than 13, the drawing
produces a feeling of map shock.

00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:05.121
It's too complex.

00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:07.664
So the sweet spot is between 5 and 13.

00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:10.294
So if you want to communicate
something visually,

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:14.021
have between five and 13 nodes
in your diagram.

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:16.725
So though we may not
be skilled at drawing,

00:03:16.725 --> 00:03:20.856
the point is that we intuitively know
how to break down complex things

00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:24.116
into simple things and then 
bring them back together again.

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:27.337
So this brings us to our second part of 
the exercise,

00:03:27.337 --> 00:03:28.913
which is how to make toast,

00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:31.713
but now with sticky notes
or with cards.

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:33.141
So what happens then?

00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:37.462
Well, with cards, most people
tend to draw clear, more detailed,

00:03:37.462 --> 00:03:39.740
and more logical nodes.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.317
You can see the step by step
analysis that takes place,

00:03:43.317 --> 00:03:46.549
and as they build up their model,
they move their nodes around,

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.129
rearranging them like Lego blocks.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.184
Now, though this might seem trivial,
it's actually really important.

00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:57.912
This rapid iteration of expressing
and then reflecting and analyzing

00:03:57.912 --> 00:04:01.263
is really the only way
in which we get clarity.

00:04:01.263 --> 00:04:03.911
It's the essence of the design process.

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.620
And systems theorists do tell us

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.182
that the ease with which
we can change a representation

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.767
correlates to our willingness
to improve the model.

00:04:13.447 --> 00:04:17.239
So sticky note systems
are not only more fluid,

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.279
they generally produce
way more nodes than static drawings.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.010
The drawings are much richer.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.575
And this brings us
to our third part of the exercise,

00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:29.509
which is to draw how to make toast,
but this time in a group.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.271
So what happens then?

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.883
Well, here's what happens.

00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:36.500
It starts out messy,
and then it gets really messy,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.125
and then it gets messier,

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:40.052
but as people refine the models,

00:04:40.052 --> 00:04:42.583
the best nodes become more prominent,

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:45.160
and with each iteration,
the model becomes clearer

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.434
because people build
on top of each other's ideas.

00:04:48.434 --> 00:04:51.917
What emerges is a unified systems model

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:56.057
that integrates the diversity
of everyone's individual points of view,

00:04:56.057 --> 00:04:57.977
so that's a really different outcome

00:04:57.977 --> 00:05:00.648
from what usually happens 
in meetings, isn't it?

00:05:00.648 --> 00:05:03.620
So these drawings can contain
20 or more nodes,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.849
but participants don't feel map shock

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.074
because they participate in the building
of their models themselves.

00:05:10.074 --> 00:05:13.395
Now, what's also really interesting,
that the groups spontaneously mix

00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:16.854
and add additional layers
of organization to it.

00:05:16.854 --> 00:05:18.864
To deal with contradictions, for example,

00:05:18.864 --> 00:05:21.684
they add branching patterns
and parallel patterns.

00:05:21.684 --> 00:05:24.907
Oh, and by the way,
if they do it in complete silence,

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:27.663
they do it much better
and much more quickly.

00:05:27.663 --> 00:05:30.205
Really interesting --
talking gets in the way.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.897
So here's some key lessons
that can emerge from this.

00:05:33.897 --> 00:05:36.476
First, drawing helps us
understand the situations

00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:39.748
as systems with nodes
and their relationships.

00:05:39.748 --> 00:05:43.388
Movable cards produce
better systems models,

00:05:43.388 --> 00:05:46.118
because we iterate much more fluidly.

00:05:46.118 --> 00:05:49.332
And then the group notes produce 
the most comprehensive models

00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:52.689
because we synthesize
several points of view.

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.275
So that's interesting.

00:05:54.275 --> 00:05:57.581
When people work together
under the right circumstances,

00:05:57.581 --> 00:06:00.692
group models are much better
than individual models.

00:06:00.692 --> 00:06:05.639
So this approach works really great
for drawing how to make toast,

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.528
but what if you wanted to draw
something more relevant or pressing,

00:06:09.528 --> 00:06:14.636
like your organizational vision,
or customer experience,

00:06:14.636 --> 00:06:16.940
or long-term sustainability?

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.446
There's a visual revolution
that's taking place

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:23.859
as more organizations
are addressing their wicked problems

00:06:23.859 --> 00:06:26.645
by collaboratively drawing them out.

00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:31.267
And I'm convinced that those who see
their world as movable nodes and links

00:06:31.267 --> 00:06:33.391
really have an edge.

00:06:33.391 --> 00:06:35.469
And the practice is really pretty simple.

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:38.371
You start with a question,
you collect the nodes,

00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:41.459
you refine the nodes,
you do it over again,

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:46.768
you refine and refine and refine,
and the patterns emerge,

00:06:46.768 --> 00:06:51.120
and the group gets clarity
and you answer the question.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:59.112
So this simple act of visualizing
and doing over and over again

00:06:59.112 --> 00:07:01.694
produces some really remarkable outcomes.

00:07:01.694 --> 00:07:03.581
What's really important to know

00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:07.271
is that it's the conversations
that are the important aspects,

00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:09.596
not just the models themselves.

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.384
And these visual frames of reference

00:07:11.384 --> 00:07:15.982
can grow to several hundreds
or even thousands of nodes.

00:07:15.982 --> 00:07:19.000
So, one example is from
an organization called Rodale.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.486
Big publishing company.

00:07:20.486 --> 00:07:22.622
They lost a bunch of money one year,

00:07:22.622 --> 00:07:26.964
and their executive team for three days
visualized their entire practice.

00:07:26.964 --> 00:07:32.886
And what's interesting is that
after visualizing the entire business,

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:34.650
systems upon systems,

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.716
they reclaimed 
50 million dollars of revenue,

00:07:37.716 --> 00:07:42.734
and they also moved from a D rating 
to an A rating from their customers.

00:07:42.734 --> 00:07:46.329
Why? Because there's
alignment from the executive team.

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:49.742
So I'm now on a mission
to help organizations

00:07:49.742 --> 00:07:54.456
solve their wicked problems
by using collaborative visualization,

00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:57.474
and on a site that I've produced
called drawtoast.com,

00:07:57.474 --> 00:08:00.678
I've collected a bunch of best practices.

00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:03.441
and so you can learn
how to run a workshop here,

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.584
you can learn more about
the visual language

00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:10.500
and the structure of links and nodes that
you can apply to general problem-solving,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.705
and download examples of various templates

00:08:13.705 --> 00:08:18.998
for unpacking the thorny problems
that we all face in our organizations.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:22.620
So the seemingly trivial
design exercise of drawing toast

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.661
helps us get clear, engaged and aligned.

00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:29.609
So next time you're confronted
with an interesting challenge,

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:31.943
remember what design has to teach us.

00:08:31.943 --> 00:08:35.774
Make your ideas visible,
tangible, and consequential.

00:08:35.774 --> 00:08:38.932
It's simple, it's fun, it's powerful,

00:08:38.932 --> 00:08:42.082
and I believe it's an idea
worth celebrating.

00:08:42.082 --> 00:08:43.902
Thank you.

00:08:43.902 --> 00:08:48.382
(Applause)
