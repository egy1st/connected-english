00:00:00.000 --> 00:05:08.000
(Music)

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:17.000
(Applause)

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Thank you. Ooh, I'm like, "Phew, phew, calm down. Get back into my body now." (Laughter)

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Usually when I play out, the first thing that happens is

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
people scream out, "What's she doing?!"

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I'll play at these rock shows, be on stage

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
standing completely still, and they're like,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
"What's she doing?! What's she doing?!"

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And then I'll kind of be like -- (Vvvwow!) -- and then they're like, "Whoa!"

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
(Laughter)

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I'm sure you're trying to figure out,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
"Well, how does this thing work?"

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Well, what I'm doing is

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
controlling the pitch with my left hand.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
See, the closer I get to this antenna, the higher the note gets --

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
(Portamento) --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and you can get it really low.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And with this hand I'm controlling the volume,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
so the further away my right hand gets, the louder it gets.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
(Tones)

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So basically, with both of your hands

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
when really it's continuously going ...

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
(Flourish ... Beep)

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
(Laughter)

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Sometimes I startle myself: I'll forget that I have it on,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and I'll lean over to pick up something,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and then it goes like -- (Blip) -- "Oh!"

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And it's like a funny sound effect that follows you around

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
if you don't turn the thing off.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
(Laughter)

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Maybe we'll go into the next tune,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
because I totally lost where this is going.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
We're going to do a song by David Mash called "Listen: the Words Are Gone,"

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:10:20.000
(Music)

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:30.000
(Applause)

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
So, I'm trying to think of some of the questions

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that are commonly asked; there are so many.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And ... Well, I guess I could tell you

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
a little of the history of the theremin.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It was invented around the 1920s, and the inventor, LÃ©on Theremin

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
-- he also was a musician besides an inventor --

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
he came up with the idea for making the theremin,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I think, when he was working on some shortwave radios.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And there'd be that sound in the signal -- it's like (Screeching) --

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and he thought, "Oh, what if I could control that sound

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and turn it into an instrument, because there are pitches in it."

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And so somehow through developing that,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And a lot of times, even kids nowadays,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
they'll make reference to a theremin by going, "Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,"

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
because in the '50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that sound that's like ... (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
(Laughter)

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
It's kind of a funny, goofy sound to do.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And sometimes if I have too much coffee,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
then my vibrato gets out of hand.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
You're really sensitive to your body and its functions

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
when you're behind this thing.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what Michael was doing --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
with what you're playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time;

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
you want to be feeling the music.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And then also, you're trying to stay very, very, very still

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
because little movements with other parts of your body

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
will affect the pitch, or sometimes if you're holding a low note -- (Tone rising out of key) --

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and breathing will make it ...

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
(Laughter)


00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
If I pass out on the next song ...

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
(Laughter)

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I think of it almost like

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
of every little crazy thing your body is doing,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
while you're playing; you don't want to have any sudden movements.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And if I go to a club and play a gig, people are like,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
"Here, have some drinks on us!"

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And it's like, "Well, I'm about to go on soon;

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I don't want to be like -- (Teetering tones) -- you know?"

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
It really does reflect the mood that you're in also,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
if you're ...

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
it's similar to being a vocalist, except

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
instead of it coming out of your throat,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
you're controlling it just in the air

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and you don't really have a point of reference;

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
You just have to always adjust to what's happening

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and listen to it, adjust it, and just move on,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000
or else you'll get too tied up and go crazy. Like me.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I think we will play another tune now.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I'm going to do "Lush Life." It's one of my favorite tunes to play.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:18:50.000
(Music)

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
(Applause)
