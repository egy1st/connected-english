00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:02.610
I'm an artist and I cut books.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.316
This is one of my first book works.

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:06.340
It's called "Alternate
Route to Knowledge."

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.132
I wanted to create a stack of books so
that somebody could come into the gallery

00:00:10.132 --> 00:00:12.952
and think they're just looking
at a regular stack of books,

00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:16.441
but then as they got closer they would
see this rough hole carved into it,

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.417
and wonder what was happening,
wonder why,

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:20.453
and think about the material of the book.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.543
So I'm interested in the texture,

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:26.663
but I'm more interested in the text
and the images that we find within books.

00:00:27.623 --> 00:00:31.524
In most of my work, what I do is I seal
the edges of a book with a thick varnish

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:34.334
so it's creating sort of a skin
on the outside of the book

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:38.202
so it becomes a solid material,
but then the pages inside are still loose,

00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:40.352
and then I carve
into the surface of the book,

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:42.883
and I'm not moving or adding anything.

00:00:42.883 --> 00:00:45.762
I'm just carving around
whatever I find interesting.

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:48.223
So everything you see
within the finished piece

00:00:48.223 --> 00:00:50.996
is exactly where it was
in the book before I began.

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.014
I think of my work as sort of
a remix, in a way,

00:00:55.014 --> 00:00:57.345
because I'm working with
somebody else's material

00:00:57.345 --> 00:01:00.973
in the same way that a D.J. might be
working with somebody else's music.

00:01:00.973 --> 00:01:04.918
This was a book of Raphael paintings,
the Renaissance artist,

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:09.353
and by taking his work
and remixing it, carving into it,

00:01:09.353 --> 00:01:13.045
I'm sort of making it into something
that's more new and more contemporary.

00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:17.781
I'm thinking also about breaking out
of the box of the traditional book

00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:19.917
and pushing that linear format,

00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:23.900
and try to push the structure
of the book itself

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.423
so that the book can become
fully sculptural.

00:01:29.303 --> 00:01:33.068
I'm using clamps and ropes
and all sorts of materials, weights,

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:36.040
in order to hold things 
in place before I varnish

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.600
so that I can push the form 
before I begin,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.242
so that something like this
can become a piece like this,

00:01:43.242 --> 00:01:46.130
which is just made
from a single dictionary.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.368
Or something like this
can become a piece like this.

00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:56.244
Or something like this,

00:01:56.244 --> 00:02:00.255
which who knows what that's going to be
or why that's in my studio,

00:02:00.255 --> 00:02:04.274
will become a piece like this.

00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:08.685
So I think one of the reasons
people are disturbed by destroying books,

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:10.228
people don't want to rip books

00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:12.359
and nobody really wants
to throw away a book,

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.552
is that we think about books
as living things,

00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:16.223
we think about them as a body,

00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:19.313
and they're created
to relate to our body, as far as scale,

00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:21.741
but they also have the potential
to continue to grow

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:23.731
and to continue to become new things.

00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:26.458
So books really are alive.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:28.988
So I think of the book as a body,

00:02:28.988 --> 00:02:31.692
and I think of the book as a technology.

00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:34.081
I think of the book as a tool.

00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:40.435
And I also think of the book as a machine.

00:02:40.435 --> 00:02:42.809
I also think of the book as a landscape.

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:47.081
This is a full set of encyclopedias
that's been connected and sanded together,

00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:49.334
and as I carve through it,

00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:51.275
I'm deciding what I want to choose.

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:53.863
So with encyclopedias,
I could have chosen anything,

00:02:53.863 --> 00:02:56.530
but I specifically chose
images of landscapes.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.966
And with the material itself,
I'm using sandpaper

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:04.658
and sanding the edges
so not only the images suggest landscape,

00:03:04.658 --> 00:03:07.366
but the material itself
suggests a landscape as well.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:12.889
So one of the things I do
is when I'm carving through the book,

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.570
I'm thinking about images,
but I'm also thinking about text,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.775
and I think about them
in a very similar way,

00:03:18.775 --> 00:03:21.647
because what's interesting
is that when we're reading text,

00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:23.146
when we're reading a book,

00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:24.615
it puts images in our head,

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:26.638
so we're sort of filling that piece.

00:03:26.638 --> 00:03:30.039
We're sort of creating images
when we're reading text,

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.916
and when we're looking at an image,
we actually use language

00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:35.632
in order to understand
what we're looking at.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.861
So there's sort of
a yin-yang that happens,

00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:39.138
sort of a flip flop.

00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:44.677
So I'm creating a piece
that the viewer is completing themselves.

00:03:45.477 --> 00:03:48.960
And I think of my work
as almost an archaeology.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.979
I'm excavating and I'm trying
to maximize the potential

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.068
and discover as much as I possibly can

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:56.709
and exposing it within my own work.

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:59.896
But at the same time,

00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:01.870
I'm thinking about this idea of erasure,

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.351
and what's happening now that most
of our information is intangible,

00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:09.393
and this idea of loss,

00:04:09.393 --> 00:04:13.711
and this idea that not only is the format
constantly shifting within computers,

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:16.033
but the information itself,

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:18.262
now that we don't have a physical backup,

00:04:18.262 --> 00:04:23.843
has to be constantly updated
in order to not lose it.

00:04:23.843 --> 00:04:26.623
And I have several dictionaries
in my own studio,

00:04:26.623 --> 00:04:29.140
and I do use a computer every day,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.933
and if I need to look up a word,
I'll go on the computer,

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:35.259
because I can go directly
and instantly to what I'm looking up.

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.209
I think that the book was never really

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:40.204
the right format
for nonlinear information,

00:04:40.204 --> 00:04:42.278
which is why we're seeing reference books

00:04:42.278 --> 00:04:46.153
becoming the first to be 
endangered or extinct.

00:04:49.743 --> 00:04:52.510
So I don't think that the book
will ever really die.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.806
People think that now that we have
digital technology,

00:04:56.806 --> 00:04:58.178
the book is going to die,

00:04:58.178 --> 00:05:01.381
and we are seeing things shifting
and things evolving.

00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:03.505
I think that the book will evolve,

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:06.767
and just like people said
painting would die

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:11.167
when photography and printmaking
became everyday materials,

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:13.154
but what it really allowed painting to do

00:05:13.154 --> 00:05:15.706
was it allowed painting
to quit its day job.

00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:22.021
It allowed painting to not have to have
that everyday chore of telling the story,

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:25.435
and painting became free
and was allowed to tell its own story,

00:05:25.435 --> 00:05:27.512
and that's when we saw Modernism emerge,

00:05:27.512 --> 00:05:29.754
and we saw painting
go into different branches.

00:05:29.754 --> 00:05:32.238
And I think that's what's
happening with books now,

00:05:32.238 --> 00:05:34.933
now that most of our technology,
most of our information,

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:39.127
most of our personal and cultural 
records are in digital form,

00:05:39.127 --> 00:05:42.079
I think it's really allowing the book
to become something new.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:44.869
So I think it's a very exciting time
for an artist like me,

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:48.439
and it's very exciting to see what
will happen with the book in the future.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.768
Thank you.

00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:53.576
(Applause)
