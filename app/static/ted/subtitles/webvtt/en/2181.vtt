00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.720
So infectious diseases, right?

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.870
Infectious diseases 
are still the main cause

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.197
of human suffering and death 
around the world.

00:00:06.197 --> 00:00:11.367
Every year, millions of people die
of diseases such as T.B., malaria, HIV,

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:13.713
around the world 
and even in the United States.

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:17.319
Every year, thousands of Americans
die of seasonal flu.

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:19.474
Now of course, humans,
we are creative. Right?

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:22.799
We have come up with ways to protect
ourselves against these diseases.

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.104
We have drugs and vaccines.

00:00:24.104 --> 00:00:27.489
And we're conscious --
we learn from our experiences

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.416
and come up with creative solutions.

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:32.481
We used to think we're alone in this,
but now we know we're not.

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.300
We're not the only medical doctors.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.706
Now we know that there's a lot of animals
out there that can do it too.

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:39.330
Most famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.831
Not so much different from us,

00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:43.696
they can use plants
to treat their intestinal parasites.

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:47.143
But the last few decades have shown us
that other animals can do it too:

00:00:47.143 --> 00:00:50.522
elephants, porcupines,
sheep, goats, you name it.

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:54.161
And even more interesting than that
is that recent discoveries are telling us

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:59.603
that insects and other little animals with
smaller brains can use medication too.

00:00:59.603 --> 00:01:02.132
The problem with infectious diseases,
as we all know,

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:04.081
is that pathogens continue to evolve,

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:06.317
and a lot of the drugs
that we have developed

00:01:06.317 --> 00:01:07.976
are losing their efficacy.

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:12.209
And therefore, there is this great need
to find new ways to discover drugs

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.113
that we can use against our diseases.

00:01:14.113 --> 00:01:16.667
Now, I think that we
should look at these animals,

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.801
and we can learn from them
how to treat our own diseases.

00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:24.631
As a biologist, I have been studying
monarch butterflies for the last 10 years.

00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:27.999
Now, monarchs are extremely famous
for their spectacular migrations

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.109
from the U.S. and Canada
down to Mexico every year,

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.129
where millions of them come together,

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:35.660
but it's not why I started studying them.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.051
I study monarchs because they get sick.

00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:40.513
They get sick like you.
They get sick like me.

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:43.200
And I think what they do
can tell us a lot about drugs

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.412
that we can develop for humans.

00:01:45.412 --> 00:01:47.847
Now, the parasites
that monarchs get infected with

00:01:47.847 --> 00:01:51.726
are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha --
a mouthful.

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:53.492
What they do is they produce spores,

00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:55.884
millions of spores
on the outside of the butterfly

00:01:55.884 --> 00:01:59.261
that are shown as little specks
in between the scales of the butterfly.

00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:01.619
And this is really detrimental
to the monarch.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.267
It shortens their lifespan,

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:05.372
it reduces their ability to fly,

00:02:05.372 --> 00:02:07.879
it can even kill them
before they're even adults.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.760
Very detrimental parasite.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.916
As part of my job, I spend a lot of time
in the greenhouse growing plants,

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:17.469
and the reason for this is that monarchs
are extremely picky eaters.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.464
They only eat milkweed as larvae.

00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:22.549
Luckily, there are several
species of milkweed that they can use,

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.905
and all these milkweeds
have cardenolides in them.

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:26.699
These are chemicals that are toxic.

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.094
They're toxic to most animals,
but not to monarchs.

00:02:29.094 --> 00:02:31.316
In fact, monarchs
can take up the chemicals,

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:33.724
put it in their own bodies,
and it makes them toxic

00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:36.003
against their predators, such as birds.

00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:38.377
And what they do, then,
is advertise this toxicity

00:02:38.377 --> 00:02:40.398
through their beautiful
warning colorations

00:02:40.398 --> 00:02:42.476
with this orange, black and white.

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:46.348
So what I did during my job
is grow plants in the greenhouse,

00:02:46.348 --> 00:02:48.094
different ones, different milkweeds.

00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:50.848
Some were toxic, including
the tropical milkweed,

00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:54.137
with very high concentrations
of these cardenolides.

00:02:54.137 --> 00:02:55.315
And some were not toxic.

00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:57.635
And then I fed them to monarchs.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:00.258
Some of the monarchs were healthy.
They had no disease.

00:03:00.258 --> 00:03:02.033
But some of the monarchs were sick,

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:05.056
and what I found is that
some of these milkweeds are medicinal,

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:08.293
meaning they reduce the disease symptoms
in the monarch butterflies,

00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:11.410
meaning these monarchs can live longer
when they are infected

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.324
when feeding on these medicinal plants.

00:03:13.324 --> 00:03:16.035
And when I found this, I had this idea,

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:18.343
and a lot of people said
it was a crazy idea,

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:20.817
but I thought, 
what if monarchs can use this?

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:23.876
What if they can use these plants
as their own form of medicine?

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:26.478
What if they can act as medical doctors?

00:03:26.828 --> 00:03:28.854
So my team and I
started doing experiments.

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:30.655
In the first types of experiments,

00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:32.825
we had caterpillars,
and gave them a choice:

00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:35.566
medicinal milkweed versus
non-medicinal milkweed.

00:03:35.566 --> 00:03:39.186
And then we measured how much they ate
of each species over their lifetime.

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:42.200
And the result, as so often 
in science, was boring:

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.451
Fifty percent of their food was medicinal.
Fifty percent was not.

00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:49.721
These caterpillars didn't do
anything for their own welfare.

00:03:50.611 --> 00:03:52.686
So then we moved on to adult butterflies,

00:03:52.686 --> 00:03:54.577
and we started asking the question

00:03:54.577 --> 00:03:57.735
whether it's the mothers
that can medicate their offspring.

00:03:57.735 --> 00:04:00.509
Can the mothers lay their eggs
on medicinal milkweed

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.708
that will make their
future offspring less sick?

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:06.236
We have done these experiments now
over several years,

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:08.024
and always get the same results.

00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:10.186
What we do is we put
a monarch in a big cage,

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:13.669
a medicinal plant on one side,
a non-medicinal plant on the other side,

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.245
and then we measure the number of eggs
that the monarchs lay on each plant.

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:21.354
And what we find when we do that
is always the same.

00:04:21.354 --> 00:04:24.947
What we find is that the monarchs
strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed.

00:04:24.947 --> 00:04:27.048
In other words,
what these females are doing

00:04:27.048 --> 00:04:30.392
is they're laying 68 percent
of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed.

00:04:30.392 --> 00:04:34.612
Intriguingly, what they do
is they actually transmit the parasites

00:04:34.612 --> 00:04:36.077
when they're laying the eggs.

00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:37.512
They cannot prevent this.

00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:39.443
They can also not medicate themselves.

00:04:39.443 --> 00:04:41.680
But what these experiments tell us

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.509
is that these monarchs, these mothers,
can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.148
that will make their
future offspring less sick.

00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:53.581
Now, this is a really
important discovery, I think,

00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:56.415
not just because it tells us
something cool about nature,

00:04:56.415 --> 00:05:00.101
but also because it may tell us something
more about how we should find drugs.

00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:02.101
Now, these are animals that are very small

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.200
and we tend to think of them
as very simple.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.757
They have tiny little brains,

00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:08.181
yet they can do this
very sophisticated medication.

00:05:08.811 --> 00:05:11.389
Now, we know that even today,
most of our drugs

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.148
derive from natural products,
including plants,

00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:15.760
and in indigenous cultures,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.595
traditional healers often look
at animals to find new drugs.

00:05:18.595 --> 00:05:22.002
In this way, elephants have told us
how to treat stomach upset,

00:05:22.002 --> 00:05:25.291
and porcupines have told people
how to treat bloody diarrhea.

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.946
What I think is important, 
though, is to move beyond

00:05:27.946 --> 00:05:31.754
these large-brained mammals
and give these guys more credit,

00:05:31.754 --> 00:05:34.656
these simple animals, these insects
that we tend to think of

00:05:34.656 --> 00:05:37.905
as very, very simple
with tiny little brains.

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:41.876
The discovery that these animals
can also use medication

00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:44.355
opens up completely new avenues,

00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:49.069
and I think that maybe one day,
we will be treating human diseases

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.178
with drugs that were first
discovered by butterflies,

00:05:52.178 --> 00:05:56.153
and I think that is an amazing opportunity
worth pursuing.

00:05:56.153 --> 00:05:58.316
Thank you so much.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:02.821
(Applause)
