00:00:01.032 --> 00:00:05.602
No doubt, when you think about a computer,
you imagine something like this:

00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:09.423
but let me tell you that there are
many other computers around us,

00:00:09.447 --> 00:00:11.226
and we don't notice them.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.841
Washing machines, elevators,
medical equipment, cars.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:18.408
They are all equipped with some sort
of electronic intelligence,

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:21.700
a brain that we call "computer".

00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:25.371
For example, a washing machine
can be programed

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:29.011
to fill with water, to wash and rinse,

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:31.922
to refill, wash, rinse and spin.

00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:36.228
These automatic processes are carried out
by programs stored in a computer.

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:38.441
Elevators, depending
on which floor we are on,

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:41.859
which button we press,
or if we're going up or down,

00:00:41.883 --> 00:00:44.798
are controlled by a computer
that decides where it takes you.

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:50.427
In a sense, the computers in elevators
and washing machines are similar.

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:53.618
Other types of computers
need to be more dynamic,

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:56.091
for example, the computers
in medical equipment,

00:00:56.115 --> 00:00:58.682
where a person's life is at stake,

00:00:58.706 --> 00:01:02.095
or in traffic lights, where if the light
is supposed to be red

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.083
and it suddenly goes green,
it could cause an accident.

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:08.240
Or the electronic braking system of a car.

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.228
Or in the case of oilfield equipment,

00:01:12.252 --> 00:01:17.318
located hours or even days
away from the nearest town,

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:19.571
that equipment can't break down,

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:22.509
because they can't just go
and repair it all the time.

00:01:23.655 --> 00:01:25.129
The question is:

00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:28.446
Who designs these computers?

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.832
Who makes them? Who programs them?

00:01:31.856 --> 00:01:35.350
And the truth is that in our country,
we often rely on computers

00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:38.392
that are manufactured abroad and imported.

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:40.593
So we depend on others.

00:01:41.114 --> 00:01:43.923
And this makes many Argentine companies

00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:46.813
not want to use electronics

00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:50.742
that could improve their products
or their production processes,

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:55.899
while others decide to continue using
their old, obsolete technology,

00:01:57.327 --> 00:02:02.743
or choose to use imported electronic goods
and thus, depend on others.

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:04.799
There are very few who feel inspired

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:08.214
to develop their own electronic solutions.

00:02:09.377 --> 00:02:12.760
A little less than a year ago,
together with a group of people,

00:02:14.043 --> 00:02:17.395
we decided to try
to reverse this situation,

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.250
to help small and medium-sized
businesses in our country.

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:27.587
You may think that we're all
Nobel Prize winners or NASA experts,

00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:29.038
but no, we are not.

00:02:29.062 --> 00:02:33.300
Let me say that we're students, engineers,

00:02:33.324 --> 00:02:36.171
businessmen, journalists, designers.

00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:41.354
We're located all over the country,

00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:44.507
and that means we're people
with different lifestyles

00:02:45.652 --> 00:02:47.127
and we are very young,

00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:49.699
with an average age of roughly 30 years.

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.884
I wish I had a photo
so you could see the whole group,

00:02:53.908 --> 00:02:56.861
dozens and dozens of people,
but the truth is I don't have one,

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.820
because many of them
have never met in real life,

00:02:59.844 --> 00:03:02.906
and maybe they will never meet
or get to know each other

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.285
because they work over the Internet,
and share files by e-mail or on Skype.

00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:10.332
Despite that, we make it work.

00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:16.631
And together we made the CIA or CIAA,

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:18.754
the Argentine Open Industrial Computer,

00:03:18.778 --> 00:03:20.634
which is what I have here in my hand.

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:25.766
I mentioned already why we call it
a computer and why it is industrial.

00:03:26.668 --> 00:03:27.859
But why "open"?

00:03:27.883 --> 00:03:31.381
Because all the documentation,
all the information on how it is made,

00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:34.967
manufactured and everything else,
is available online.

00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:38.451
Anybody can download it and use it freely.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.701
Now we can say
that the CIA has no secrets.

00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:43.965
(Laughter)

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:46.999
What does that mean?

00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:52.865
Let's say a company needs a computer
for their manufacturing process;

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.459
they can go and buy one from any seller,

00:03:55.484 --> 00:03:57.500
knowing it won't depend on that vendor,

00:03:57.524 --> 00:03:59.144
because tomorrow they could buy it

00:03:59.168 --> 00:04:01.608
from a third party,
or manufacture it themselves.

00:04:01.632 --> 00:04:06.092
Or, for example, if you have to build
a computer-controlled machine,

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:08.976
you can say, "Well, I'll make my own."

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.825
Or you can say:

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.536
"I'll download the information
then make my modifications - it's free."

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.470
and so, make your own version
for your own purposes.

00:04:18.494 --> 00:04:22.885
And that implies job creation,

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:26.300
and it generates wealth
and added value in our country.

00:04:26.324 --> 00:04:29.498
There are other types
of open computers in the world,

00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:34.183
but they're usually operated
by multinational companies

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:37.593
that manufacture
the integrated circuits, the chips.

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:39.872
And they do it as a marketing strategy,

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:46.481
so that you're obligated to use
that particular company's chip.

00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:50.189
By contrast, as we do not depend
on any multinational company,

00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:53.274
we offer different versions
based on different processors,

00:04:53.298 --> 00:04:55.674
and that means we are totally free,

00:04:55.698 --> 00:04:58.021
we do not depend
on any particular company.

00:04:58.995 --> 00:05:01.991
In addition, this computer
that I have here in my hand,

00:05:03.462 --> 00:05:06.169
is the first open industrial computer.

00:05:06.193 --> 00:05:12.738
It was designed from the start
to be used in industrial applications.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.441
So, what is this made of?

00:05:18.465 --> 00:05:24.518
Basically, it's composed of circuits,
programs, and a motherboard.

00:05:25.512 --> 00:05:26.735
How do we do it?

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.090
Well, one person shows up
and says, "I can do X."

00:05:29.115 --> 00:05:32.343
Another says, "OK, I can do Y,"
and yet another, "I'd like to help."

00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:35.277
My job is to coordinate it all.

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:39.424
And there are even companies,
small Argentine companies,

00:05:39.448 --> 00:05:41.526
that are competing in a certain niche,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.697
but understand
that if they participate and collaborate,

00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:49.942
one will sell a little more,
one can sell even more perhaps,

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:53.252
but they will all grow because
the industry is growing nationally.

00:05:54.078 --> 00:05:58.504
And to do this, we have
no owner manual, no recipe,

00:05:58.528 --> 00:06:02.281
because it is something that was
never done before anywhere in the world.

00:06:02.305 --> 00:06:05.312
We learn as we go.

00:06:05.336 --> 00:06:09.995
And this project is based on
collaborative volunteer work,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.373
by people who don't charge for it,

00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:14.601
who maybe do it at night,

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:18.488
when they return home from work,
or during the weekend.

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:21.808
Some of them are lucky
and can do it at work.

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:29.729
But if we add up the total number
of hours they invest in this,

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.652
it would translate
into over ten million pesos.

00:06:36.207 --> 00:06:37.552
What is the CIAA used for?

00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:42.525
Well, for example, they're making
applications for medical equipment,

00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:45.929
for railway and industrial equipment,

00:06:45.953 --> 00:06:48.690
for the petroleum industry,
the agriculture industry.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.355
Plus, something very important for us

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:57.438
is that the network of more than 50
engineering schools nationwide --

00:06:57.462 --> 00:07:01.102
virtually all the national universities
where they teach electronics --

00:07:01.126 --> 00:07:03.293
are now fellow collaborators.

00:07:04.532 --> 00:07:06.856
The idea is that starting
in March of next year,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.642
all these schools will begin to use
this platform for teaching purposes,

00:07:10.666 --> 00:07:13.673
because it is a way
to spread this knowledge,

00:07:13.697 --> 00:07:16.826
and also a way for everybody to access it.

00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:22.872
This is a dream.

00:07:22.896 --> 00:07:27.901
This is the first
Argentine Open Industrial Computer.

00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:31.126
(Applause)

00:07:41.548 --> 00:07:45.404
There are people who leave
their mark with amazing things,

00:07:45.428 --> 00:07:50.536
like paintings, books, or music.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.697
We are engineers.

00:07:54.445 --> 00:08:00.759
Our magic, our art is to make
practical things such as this computer.

00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:02.216
Thank you very much.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.742
(Applause)
