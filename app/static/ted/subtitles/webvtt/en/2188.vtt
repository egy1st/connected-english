00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:06.983
Believe me, it's not easy to stand
in front of a sea of people.

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:12.161
So imagine what it must mean
to experience bullying.

00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:18.391
Bullying: these physical
or verbal assaults that occur in schools

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:22.305
and are also known as school harassment.

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:28.548
It is one of the most serious and
discussed social issues in recent times,

00:00:28.572 --> 00:00:31.868
even if five or ten years ago

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:37.153
I guess that few, if any of us,
had heard of this word.

00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:39.771
On the other hand, this isn't new,

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:42.449
it's something that has always happened.

00:00:42.473 --> 00:00:45.962
Indeed, regardless of our age,

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:50.003
we all have been faced one way
or another with this type of situation,

00:00:50.027 --> 00:00:55.130
either because we were bullied ourselves
or because we were part of the problem

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:59.626
and victimized our poor classmates
in our childhood,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.535
or simply witnessed such an act.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.348
Previously called 'to make the
laughingstock of someone, '

00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:08.224
it's now called 'bullying.'

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:13.112
I believe that what's happening
now and we're calling bullying

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:14.943
is, in fact, something new.

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:18.845
It has traces of what it used to be,
but it's not exactly the same.

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.843
For several reasons.

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:24.709
First, we didn't have
a word for it before,

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:28.316
a word to name this phenomenon
or, at least, it wasn't 'bullying'.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.640
It was not in the news,
it wasn't discussed in the media,

00:01:31.664 --> 00:01:36.732
no laws were enacted to ban or condemn it.

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:39.933
Of course, it could be a source
of suffering for many people,

00:01:39.957 --> 00:01:41.570
and indeed it was,

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:44.168
but it was deem as something
more or less normal,

00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:47.096
maybe an unintended result,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.734
a school life side effect,

00:01:50.758 --> 00:01:53.066
but not that serious an issue.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:58.358
Some people might even think
that it supported education.

00:01:59.548 --> 00:02:03.908
And something equally important is
that, at that same time, until recently,

00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:08.607
there were other school dramas
that were considered more serious

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:13.349
than these small, unimportant fights
during recess and in the hallways.

00:02:13.373 --> 00:02:18.755
I talk about referrals,
expulsions, even bad grades.

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:23.337
Both students and teachers,
parents and society in general

00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:28.433
thought those to be much more important
than what we now call bullying,

00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:31.606
although now, it tends to be the opposite:

00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:39.160
bad grades and disciplinary reprimands
seem to be less important,

00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:43.940
while this new bullying phenomenon
takes an increasingly central role.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.335
As a result, we face a simultaneous
and complementary movement

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.054
that is happening at the same time.

00:02:50.078 --> 00:02:55.235
On the one hand, traditional reasons
for school humiliation,

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:59.676
punishments applied by an authority

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.308
such as a teacher or a principal,

00:03:03.332 --> 00:03:06.879
to students who did something
that was considered wrong,

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:10.651
forbidden by regulations
or simply shouldn't be done,

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:15.690
such as misbehaving
or not studying, lose relevance.

00:03:15.714 --> 00:03:22.374
On the other hand, new reasons
for school humiliation gain ground,

00:03:22.398 --> 00:03:27.198
such as punishments
that students apply to each other

00:03:27.222 --> 00:03:29.813
mostly for causes related

00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:35.068
to the victim's physical
appearance or personality.

00:03:35.092 --> 00:03:39.005
And if this is what it happens
then the question is why?

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:42.654
Why this change in our values?

00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:49.348
I think we live in a time of historical
change and it's worth thinking about it.

00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:54.609
We can consider that, on one hand,
the reasons for school humiliation,

00:03:54.633 --> 00:04:00.225
and the traditional school conflicts
like referrals, expulsions, bad grades,

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:05.979
go back to guilt, guilt for wrongdoing.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.026
Guilt is an internal, private emotion

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.576
which points back to a moral conflict
and a personal drama we suffer from

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.678
because we have done something

00:04:17.702 --> 00:04:22.610
that not only regulations
forbid because is wrong

00:04:22.634 --> 00:04:26.423
but everyone else agrees
is wrong including myself.

00:04:26.447 --> 00:04:30.503
I feel guilty because I did something bad.

00:04:30.527 --> 00:04:35.046
In the case of bullying
guilt is not at stake,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.552
but another emotion: shame.

00:04:39.664 --> 00:04:42.801
It's not exactly the same,
it is quite different.

00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:45.407
Shame is a public emotion,

00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:51.583
it doesn't point
to a private drama for wrongdoing.

00:04:51.607 --> 00:04:54.033
When I feel ashamed,

00:04:54.057 --> 00:04:59.963
the problem isn't me
but the others, their gaze,

00:04:59.987 --> 00:05:06.345
those who judge me in an inappropriate,
unfair, and sometimes cruel way,

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:09.723
regardless of my being
guilty of wrongdoing or not.

00:05:09.747 --> 00:05:12.671
Generally speaking, I'm not the
one to be blamed for anything.

00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:16.009
It's the others who hold power
on me through that cruel gaze.

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:21.794
This is a shift in balance

00:05:21.818 --> 00:05:24.869
where shame becomes
more important than guilt

00:05:24.893 --> 00:05:28.135
and this is key to understanding

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.234
why our priorities are changing.

00:05:31.258 --> 00:05:35.497
I think that the alien gaze,
the gaze of the other,

00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:38.747
something that was
obviously always important,

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:42.937
gained a disproportionate,
perhaps an excessive importance,

00:05:44.084 --> 00:05:49.244
especially when it comes to judgments
on who people are and what are they worth.

00:05:49.268 --> 00:05:51.488
And this wasn't always the case,

00:05:51.512 --> 00:05:54.727
that's why I said we live in times
of a great historical change

00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:57.327
and a very complex one as well.

00:05:57.351 --> 00:05:59.988
It's not something new,
it's been brewing for decades,

00:06:00.012 --> 00:06:04.257
and now it's finally crystallizing.

00:06:07.197 --> 00:06:11.438
I think one of the most important
ingredients of this transformation

00:06:11.462 --> 00:06:17.096
is the abandonment of the idea
of our own inner self.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.073
What is that?

00:06:19.097 --> 00:06:25.918
It was a fundamental belief
during the past 200 years,

00:06:25.942 --> 00:06:29.403
in the 19th and 20th centuries,

00:06:29.427 --> 00:06:33.633
a conviction that we have an inner life,

00:06:33.657 --> 00:06:37.493
essential but invisible to the prying eye,

00:06:37.517 --> 00:06:39.693
a condition believed to define each of us

00:06:39.717 --> 00:06:45.318
in a much deeper and truthful way
than false appearances.

00:06:45.342 --> 00:06:51.235
Appearances were considered
false and also vain, frivolous,

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.568
something of minor importance

00:06:54.592 --> 00:07:01.403
compared with all the forcefulness
of that true and inner beauty.

00:07:03.104 --> 00:07:09.964
These values and beliefs are
within us, but we're leaving them behind.

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:19.700
It seems pretty clear to me
that false appearances

00:07:19.724 --> 00:07:21.976
are not that empty anymore:

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.483
just think of this whole phenomenon
of the cult of the body recently promoted,

00:07:26.507 --> 00:07:30.048
the importance of the personal image,
of physical appearance,

00:07:30.072 --> 00:07:34.413
the gyms, aesthetic treatments, all that.

00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:38.941
Also, what is seen and perceived is more
and every time increasingly important.

00:07:38.965 --> 00:07:42.592
And this notion that the most
important thing that defines us

00:07:42.616 --> 00:07:47.129
something that can't be seen
--not the guts--,

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:52.896
something intangible
like the soul or the spirit, is lost.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.521
It seems we believe less and less in that
and more and more in what others can see,

00:07:57.545 --> 00:07:59.651
what we prove others, what we do.

00:08:00.832 --> 00:08:05.914
Based on these changes,
the others judge us by what they see

00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:12.196
and less by this notion
of an ethereal inwardness

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.319
a quite outdated Victorian notion

00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:18.331
that would be truer
than acts and appearances.

00:08:18.355 --> 00:08:23.362
Along with all this, there are a series
of other transformation signs,

00:08:23.386 --> 00:08:26.197
one being self-promotion.

00:08:26.221 --> 00:08:30.897
Self-promotion tactics
or techniques are now ubiquitous

00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:35.479
and until recently considered bad taste.

00:08:35.503 --> 00:08:39.578
Take, for example, the obsession

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:43.677
to get the largest number
of followers or 'likes'

00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:47.777
in order to prove that you are
someone, that you exist,

00:08:47.801 --> 00:08:50.898
that you have value
and deserve admiration.

00:08:50.922 --> 00:08:54.483
The whole social networks phenomenon
could also be understood

00:08:54.507 --> 00:08:56.555
as proof of this transformation;

00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:59.484
toghether with the success
of social networks on the Internet,

00:08:59.508 --> 00:09:05.487
as well as a set of many other symptoms
and contemporary phenomena,

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:09.851
ranging from tattoos to plastic surgery,

00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:13.179
reality shows, and bullying.

00:09:14.109 --> 00:09:16.991
I believe that in this broader context

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:22.247
it's not surprising that bullying has
turned into something so serious today

00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:27.425
while school referrals and bad grades
are becoming less and less relevant.

00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:33.714
It seems that guilt lost much
of its moralizing effectiveness.

00:09:33.738 --> 00:09:38.746
Guilt isn't as effective as shame

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.892
in our lives anymore.

00:09:43.062 --> 00:09:45.211
And, of course, this is very complicated

00:09:45.235 --> 00:09:49.897
because it requires managing

00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:53.313
two seemingly contradictory trends:

00:09:53.337 --> 00:09:58.370
on one hand, we have to display
ourselves, we have to sell ourselves

00:09:58.394 --> 00:10:02.396
for the others to see who we are,
what we are and what we do,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.149
we need to cultivate and sell our image.

00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:10.852
But on the other hand, there's always
the risk that the gaze of the others

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:16.101
won't return admiration but rejection,
ridiculing or being ignored.

00:10:17.508 --> 00:10:21.662
We have become
more vulnerable to the gaze of others

00:10:21.686 --> 00:10:23.312
for that same reason.

00:10:23.336 --> 00:10:28.150
Consider also how complicated
cyberbullying is,

00:10:28.174 --> 00:10:31.429
when these slurs and sneers

00:10:31.453 --> 00:10:35.447
spread across social networks,
YouTube, Facebook, etc.,

00:10:35.471 --> 00:10:40.708
and what used to be private,
limited to the handful of friends,

00:10:40.732 --> 00:10:44.099
or protected by school or home walls,

00:10:44.123 --> 00:10:47.624
is suddenly exposed to millions of people.

00:10:47.648 --> 00:10:51.268
We all know how shame
evolves to being unbearable,

00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:55.866
much more serious and leaving us
with no place to hide,

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.798
neither within ourselves
nor in a private place,

00:10:59.822 --> 00:11:03.862
unable to dreaming
of escaping to a desert island

00:11:03.886 --> 00:11:09.189
--which are less and less now or no longer
exist, at least not without WiFi--.

00:11:11.244 --> 00:11:15.957
It seems that this idea
that hell is other people

00:11:15.981 --> 00:11:18.051
has turned truer today

00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:20.760
in the era of the permanent connection

00:11:20.784 --> 00:11:24.814
and profiles always available
on thousands of screens.

00:11:24.838 --> 00:11:30.940
They are ccompanied by this addiction
we grow for the 'like' button,

00:11:30.964 --> 00:11:34.969
that magic click we hope
everybody would grant us

00:11:34.993 --> 00:11:40.283
for any selfie or whatever
we post online about ourselves.

00:11:41.321 --> 00:11:45.137
If all this historical change
is taking place right now

00:11:45.161 --> 00:11:49.284
with these consequences and effects,
the question is: what do we do?

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:52.828
Is this better or worse
than before? Is it good or bad?

00:11:52.852 --> 00:11:55.554
How do we solve it?

00:11:55.578 --> 00:12:01.213
The bad news is that I have no solution,
but I think I have some recommendations.

00:12:01.237 --> 00:12:07.525
I think that both guilt and shame
are mechanisms of social control,

00:12:07.549 --> 00:12:12.794
and the fact that guilt is losing
much of its vigor now

00:12:12.818 --> 00:12:15.945
while shame is magnified

00:12:15.969 --> 00:12:18.589
is neither good nor bad in itself.

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:22.854
But we must bear it in mind,

00:12:22.878 --> 00:12:26.049
it means that things have already changed,

00:12:26.073 --> 00:12:28.386
and if we continue to think

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.750
that what happens now is the same
as what happened before,

00:12:31.774 --> 00:12:34.084
and we try to solve it
as if they were the same,

00:12:34.108 --> 00:12:36.274
probably we won't get very far.

00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:38.111
I wanted to share this with you.

00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:39.325
Thank you.

00:12:39.349 --> 00:12:40.542
(Applause)
