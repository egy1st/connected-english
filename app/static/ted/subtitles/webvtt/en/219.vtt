00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So, what I'd like to talk about is something

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that was very dear to Kahn's heart, which is:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
how do we discover what is really particular about a project?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000
has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization;

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and the uniqueness of a program in a building.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And so I'll take you to Wichita, Kansas,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
on a site, right downtown by the river.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And I thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river, part of the river.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Unfortunately, though, the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
so I suggested, "Let's reroute McLean,"

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
(Laughter)

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And it took six months to reroute it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The first image I showed the building committee was

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
this astronomic observatory of Jantar Mantar in Jaipur

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because I talked about what makes a building a building of science.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And it seemed to me that this structure -- complex, rich and yet

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
totally rational: it's an instrument -- had something to do with science,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And so my first sketch after I left was to say,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
"Let's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And I got all excited and came back, and

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
they sort of looked at me in dismay and said, "An island?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This used to be an island -- Ackerman Island --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs."

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
(Laughter)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And so the process began and they said,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
"You can't put it all on an island;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
some of it has to be on the mainland because

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
we don't want to turn our back to the community."

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And there emerged a design: the galleries sort of forming an island

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and you could walk through them or on the roof.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And there were all kinds of exciting features:

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
you could come in through the landside buildings,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
If you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
come back and pay the five dollars admission.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
(Laughter)

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And the client was happy -- well, sort of happy

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
because we were four million dollars over the budget, but essentially happy.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But I was still troubled, and I was troubled because I felt this was capricious.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It was complex, but there was something capricious about its complexity.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It was, what I would say, compositional complexity,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a generating idea,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
some kind of a generating geometry.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
A toroid, for those who don't know,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
is the surface of a doughnut or, for some of us, a bagel.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And out of this idea started spinning off many,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And finally the building -- this is the model.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And when there were complaints about budget, I said,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
"Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections."

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And here's the building as it opened,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
with a channel overlooking downtown, and as seen from downtown.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And the bike route's going right through the building,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building:

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
every beam in this building is the same radius, all laminated wood.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Every wall, every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Every piece of the building works.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
These are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and at night, and on opening day.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Going back to 1976.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
(Applause)

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
In 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
which you see here the campus.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I was asked to do a building,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And I felt very troubled.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
they are totally saturated with information

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and to see yet another museum with information,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
it would make them just unable to digest.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And so I made a counter-proposal:

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I said, "No building." There was a cave on the site; we tunnel into the hill,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
descend through the rock into an underground chamber.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
There's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and then you come into a large space.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
There is a single candle flickering in the center;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
by an arrangement of reflective glasses, it reflects into infinity in all directions.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You walk through the space, a voice reads the names,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
ages and place of birth of the children.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
This voice does not repeat for six months.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And then you descend to light and to the north and to life.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Well, they said, "People won't understand,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that."

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And they shelved the project. And it sat there for 10 years,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
who had lost his three-year-old son at Auschwitz,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
came, saw the model, wrote the check and it got built 10 years later.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So, many years after that in 1998,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I was on one of my monthly trips to Jerusalem

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and I got a call from the foreign ministry saying,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
"We've got the Chief Minister of the Punjab here.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
He is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
we took him to the children's memorial; he was extremely moved.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
He's demanding to meet the architect. Could you come down and meet him in Tel Aviv?"

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And I went down and Chief Minister Badal said to me,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
"We Sikhs have suffered a great deal, as you have Jews.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I was very moved by what I saw today.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people;

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
we're about to embark on that.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I'd like you to come and design it."

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And so, you know, it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But two weeks later, I was in this little town, Anandpur Sahib,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
outside Chandigarh, the capital of the Punjab,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and the temple and also next to it the fortress

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
that the last guru of the Sikhs, Guru Gobind, died in

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
as he wrote the Khalsa, which is their holy scripture.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
nine kilometers away from the town and the temple,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and said, "That's where we have chosen the location."

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And I said, "This just doesn't make any sense.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
The pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
they're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Let's get back to the town and walk to the site."

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And I recommended they do it right there, on that hill

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and this hill, and bridge all the way into the town.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And, as things are a little easier in India, the site was purchased within a week

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and we were working.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
(Laughter)

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And my proposal was to split the museum into two --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
the permanent exhibits at one end, the auditorium, library,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and changing exhibitions on the other --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
to flood the valley into a series of water gardens

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And the structures rise from the sand cliffs --

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
they're built in concrete and sandstones; the roofs are stainless steel --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And as you come from the north, it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And then I went away for four months

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and there was going to be groundbreaking.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And I came back and, lo and behold, the little model I'd left behind

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
had been built ten times bigger for public display on site

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and ... the bridge was built!

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000
(Laughter)

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Within the working drawings!

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And half a million people gathered for the celebrations;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I was renamed Safdie Singh. And there it is under construction;

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
there are 1,800 workers at work and it will be finished in two years.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Back to Yad Vashem three years ago. After all this episode began,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Yad Vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
because now Washington was built -- the Holocaust Museum in Washington --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And Yad Vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
They said, "Let's rebuild the museum."

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But of course, the Sikhs might give you a job on a platter -- the Jews make it hard:

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
international competition, phase one, phase two, phase three.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
(Laughter)

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And again, I felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
that a building the size of the Washington building --

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
50,000 square feet -- will sit on that fragile hill

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and that we will go into galleries -- rooms with doors

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and sort of familiar rooms -- to tell the story of the Holocaust.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And I proposed that we cut through the mountain. That was my first sketch.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Just cut the whole museum through the mountain --

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
enter from one side of the mountain,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
come out on the other side of the mountain --

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And here you see the model:

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
a reception building and some underground parking.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You cross a bridge, you enter this triangular room, 60 feet high,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
which cuts right into the hill

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and extends right through as you go towards the north.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And all of it, then, all the galleries are underground,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and you see the openings for the light.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And at night, just one line of light cuts through the mountain,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
which is a skylight on top of that triangle.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And all the galleries,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
as you move through them and so on, are below grade.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And there are chambers carved in the rock --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
concrete walls, stone, the natural rock when possible -- with the light shafts.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
This is actually a Spanish quarry, which sort of inspired

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
the kind of spaces that these galleries could be.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And then, coming towards the north, it opens up:

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
it bursts out of the mountain into, again, a view of light and of the city

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and of the Jerusalem hills.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I'd like to conclude with a project I've been working on for two months.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
It's the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
the U.S. Institute of Peace.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
The site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial;

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
you see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
on access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
But one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
If it were to be anywhere in Washington,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
it would be an office building, a conference center,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is --

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And that was a lot of heat to deal with.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
The first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces --

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
spaces where research goes on, conference centers,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking --

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
You see the structure as, in the sequence of structures on the Mall,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
very transparent and inviting and looking in.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And then as you enter it again, looking in all directions towards the city.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote Kundera --

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
that it had to do with whiteness,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And this is where it is; it's sort of evolving.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Studies for the structure of the roof,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
which demands maybe new materials:

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
how to make it white, how to make it translucent, how to make it glowing,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
how to make it not capricious.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And here studying, in three dimensions,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
how to give some kind, again, of order, a structure;

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
not something you feel you could just change

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
because you stop the design of that particular process.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And so it goes.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I'd like to conclude by saying something ...

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.000
(Applause)

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term "beauty."

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And I know it is not a fashionable term these days,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
but it seems to me that all this, in one way or the other, is a search for beauty.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Beauty in the most profound sense of fit.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I have a quote that I like by a morphologist, 1917,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Theodore Cook, who said, "Beauty connotes humanity.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
We call a natural object beautiful because we see

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
that its form expresses fitness, the perfect fulfillment of function."

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Well, I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Nevertheless, beauty as the kind of fit; something that tells us

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Twenty years ago, in a conference Richard and I were at together,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I wrote a poem, which seems to me to still hold for me today.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
"He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
He who seeks order shall find gratification.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
shall find the joy of self-expression. He who seeks self-expression

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
shall fall into the pit of arrogance.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Arrogance is incompatible with nature.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Through nature, the nature of the universe and the nature of man,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
we shall seek truth. If we seek truth, we shall find beauty."

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Thank you very much. (Applause)
