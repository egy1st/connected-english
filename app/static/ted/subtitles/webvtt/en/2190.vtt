WEBVTT

00:00:01.421 --> 00:00:05.794
Five years ago I met two gentlemen.

00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:09.425
I am the one on the right.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.126
(Laughter)

00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:15.385
We have different backgrounds,

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.895
we never happened to meet elsewhere,

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.254
we never ran into each other before.

00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:23.589
We all have an academic career,

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:29.695
an engineering degree, a business degree,
and we work on four continents.

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:34.362
We are a physicist,
a chemist, and an economist.

00:00:35.338 --> 00:00:38.450
The three of us were
at that time at an age

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:42.117
where folks rather contemplate retirement

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.896
than a bold launch
into innovative ventures.

00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:51.648
Nevertheless, 11 months later,
we built something new together,

00:00:52.336 --> 00:00:54.540
something truly new:

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:58.859
a device to tell the truth in public.

00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:03.087
To tell the truth?
What exactly were we talking about?

00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:06.369
Most of the statements we make everyday

00:01:06.393 --> 00:01:10.144
can't be classified as true or false.

00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:13.933
Sentences such as: "Hi, how are you?"

00:01:13.957 --> 00:01:16.296
"Let's have a coffee,"

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:22.298
fall under greetings, invitations,
orders, opinions, suggestions,

00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:24.925
and they are neither true nor false.

00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:28.402
On the other hand,
those like "It's raining,"

00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:31.707
"That's 365 pesos cash,"

00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:34.473
"This house is mine,"

00:01:35.607 --> 00:01:38.017
are statements that can be verified.

00:01:38.793 --> 00:01:44.379
I am exclusively talking about
the sentences referring to true facts.

00:01:47.422 --> 00:01:51.983
Those that anybody with goodwill,
common sense,

00:01:52.363 --> 00:01:55.220
and appealing to elementary logic

00:01:55.244 --> 00:01:59.216
might decide, faced with facts,
if they are true or misleading.

00:02:00.778 --> 00:02:06.068
I refer to something similar
to what we use in our contracts,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.157
when we come to an agreement,

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:12.991
when we negotiate our wages,

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:17.177
upon purchasing
a washing machine, for example.

00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:19.660
"That will be 15,000 pesos

00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:23.088
in 12 equal installments from the date

00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:27.461
and to be delivered at your home
tomorrow between 14.00 and 17.00 hours."

00:02:28.404 --> 00:02:32.113
Nothing's vague, tricky, or ambiguous.

00:02:33.906 --> 00:02:36.825
I doubt anyone can just walk away
with the washing machine

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.982
or get off Scot-free

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:43.060
by arguing neoliberalism is harmful

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:46.700
or objectivity does not exist.

00:02:48.886 --> 00:02:53.498
So let's agree then
the facts really tell in these cases

00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:57.201
and the truth about them really matters.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.505
We take those sentences
zealously, diligently, responsibly,

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.543
because the data they contained

00:03:07.528 --> 00:03:09.908
has an impact on our lives.

00:03:10.707 --> 00:03:14.187
Now, that's happening
in the private sphere.

00:03:14.563 --> 00:03:16.757
What about the public discourse?

00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:21.100
That is to say the discourse poured
in the public space by the politicians,

00:03:21.124 --> 00:03:25.451
the media, the press, businessmen,
the trade unions, social referents.

00:03:26.854 --> 00:03:29.822
Lately, the public discourse,
- though it isn't something

00:03:29.846 --> 00:03:33.164
that hasn't happened
in Argentina or in the world before -

00:03:33.188 --> 00:03:35.442
has started to move away from the facts.

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:39.694
The facts and the truth
fade into the background,

00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:45.050
with narrative, gossip, and opinion
taking the central stage,

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:51.316
as well as the biased data,
innuendos, even sheer manipulation.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.987
The political discourse,

00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:56.707
- as well as the media's
and every other social actor's -

00:03:56.731 --> 00:04:00.898
grew more and more dependent
on the narrative.

00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:03.929
And there is a reason for this.

00:04:03.953 --> 00:04:06.327
Narrative is powerful

00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:11.712
if only because it bypasses
a rational analysis of objective facts

00:04:11.736 --> 00:04:14.187
to hit home on emotions.

00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:18.207
And driven by emotions
we subscribe to proposals,

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:23.056
political parties' and references' ideas.

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.984
The problem is when the narrative

00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:34.606
starts having a life of its own.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.316
They are powerful
because we think so of them.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.709
Humans think in narratives
and not about isolated incidents.

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:49.842
Take Coca-Cola for example and its use
of the power of storytelling

00:04:49.866 --> 00:04:53.170
that sells 1.7 billion drinks a day,

00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:57.673
as well as other nonprofit,
nongovernmental organizations

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.633
that manage to eradicate
childhood diarrhea

00:05:00.657 --> 00:05:02.433
in areas where it is endemic,

00:05:02.457 --> 00:05:04.713
or bring at the forefront
of social agendas

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:08.134
causes such as the need
for the environmental protection,

00:05:08.158 --> 00:05:11.329
gender equality, and human rights,

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:17.509
However, when the narrative spreads
across the entire public discourse,

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:20.238
the hard facts and the truth

00:05:20.262 --> 00:05:25.092
turn into unwelcome guests,
into obstacles, or mere limits.

00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:31.673
And they decide to ignore them,
or that they must be left aside,

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:36.122
banished from the public discourse
or simply hidden from sight.

00:05:36.146 --> 00:05:38.955
Thus, debate on the issue
tends to slowly disappear

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.129
because it is difficult to discuss when
the facts or the truth aren't available.

00:05:46.564 --> 00:05:49.858
This is how we came to witness a situation

00:05:50.353 --> 00:05:55.599
where the media, the politicians,
the social referents enter into a state

00:05:55.623 --> 00:06:00.973
the kind where they completely reject
to meet their commitments,

00:06:00.997 --> 00:06:04.365
or recognize the facts and the truth,

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.722
and thus cheat, commit crimes,

00:06:09.215 --> 00:06:12.471
and enter in a kind of default state

00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:15.839
when it comes to their role
and mission towards citizens.

00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:21.943
And we, as citizens immersed
in this narrative paradigm,

00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:25.190
also slacken in our efforts

00:06:25.214 --> 00:06:28.819
to claim reporting
based on factual evidence,

00:06:28.843 --> 00:06:33.407
and to call for a narrative
based on truth.

00:06:35.185 --> 00:06:40.552
Thus, our involvement
with the public discourse

00:06:40.576 --> 00:06:42.983
increasingly declines.

00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:51.363
This means for many of us,
and without even realizing it

00:06:51.387 --> 00:06:56.383
that we are undermining
the essence of democracy itself.

00:06:58.727 --> 00:07:02.688
Democracy is citizen-centered,

00:07:02.712 --> 00:07:06.851
it's powered
through citizen participation.

00:07:08.837 --> 00:07:13.696
It depends on us as social actors,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.652
as agents of democracy.

00:07:18.031 --> 00:07:22.709
And to be an agent of democracy
we rely on information

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:26.766
instant, live information,
ready for action.

00:07:29.442 --> 00:07:33.142
Without timely and accurate information
it is impossible to act as agents,

00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:36.346
and we depend on others
for that kind of information;

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:42.408
on the media, on those in whom
we've placed our faith and trust.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:58.503
And this is precisely
what we have decided to do,

00:08:00.675 --> 00:08:06.526
reinsert that lost faith and trust
into the democratic discourse.

00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:11.114
To do that, I together with my partners

00:08:13.438 --> 00:08:17.323
who far from retiring
are actively involved,

00:08:17.347 --> 00:08:21.272
devised a means that can ensure
the quality of the public discourse,

00:08:21.296 --> 00:08:25.066
to ensure the quality of public discourse,

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.258
and telling the truth publicly.

00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:32.350
We founded Chequeado.com,

00:08:32.374 --> 00:08:37.176
a site dedicated to the restoration
of the naked truth and hard facts

00:08:38.086 --> 00:08:40.441
back into the public discourse.

00:08:41.203 --> 00:08:45.450
Chequeado verifies all statements

00:08:46.188 --> 00:08:52.061
made in the public discourse
by all social actors.

00:08:53.109 --> 00:08:57.562
It assembles quotes from politicians,

00:08:58.197 --> 00:09:01.818
the media and trade unionists,

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:05.930
and analyzes the facts.

00:09:06.772 --> 00:09:13.269
It runs them against other
independent sources and contrasts them

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:20.528
with what other specialists
and independent sources have stated.

00:09:23.304 --> 00:09:29.134
It scans for all information
and evidence available

00:09:29.158 --> 00:09:33.900
and establishes whether
such information is correct,

00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:36.519
true or misleading.

00:09:37.608 --> 00:09:40.380
For that, we have to also earn
people's trust

00:09:41.749 --> 00:09:44.030
to be read and be believed.

00:09:45.378 --> 00:09:50.300
Chequeado has its own style manual
and checking methods

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.033
and terminally prohibits
any political biases,

00:09:56.057 --> 00:09:58.926
prejudice

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.870
and partisanship,

00:10:00.894 --> 00:10:05.980
and advocates for the existence
of mechanisms that ensure all this.

00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:09.668
Chequeado has a large number

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:12.867
of very diverse funding sources

00:10:14.837 --> 00:10:18.322
precisely to avoid
relying on each of them,

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:23.089
and thus it depends a little bit
on each of those who make a donation,

00:10:23.113 --> 00:10:25.482
it depends a little bit on everybody.

00:10:26.307 --> 00:10:31.084
Our statutes prohibit any dependency

00:10:31.108 --> 00:10:34.755
and interference coming from its founders.

00:10:35.921 --> 00:10:39.038
Chequeado has had a huge impact

00:10:41.111 --> 00:10:44.728
not only on the citizens
but also on the political actors.

00:10:45.987 --> 00:10:47.979
Ministers visit our website,

00:10:49.345 --> 00:10:52.359
legislators share data with us,

00:10:53.546 --> 00:10:58.218
the press is mentioning us,
politicians need to retract due to us,

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.746
and there are even some of them
who choose to fight with us,

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:09.679
but all, many of them,
think twice before speaking.

00:11:12.515 --> 00:11:15.675
Our community is causing

00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:20.554
the facts and the truth
to be valued again.

00:11:21.282 --> 00:11:24.513
I am part of the Chequeado community

00:11:25.007 --> 00:11:28.755
I read it, I follow it
on Twitter and Facebook,

00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:33.264
I listen to it on the radio,
I watch it on television,

00:11:33.288 --> 00:11:35.473
and the live feeds on key events,

00:11:36.841 --> 00:11:40.616
such as the presidential speeches,

00:11:41.886 --> 00:11:45.188
that are all gathered
into the general pool

00:11:45.212 --> 00:11:47.890
of the data on our platform.

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:52.625
Chequeado has proven

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:55.912
that a social partnership is possible.

00:12:00.806 --> 00:12:04.330
and we dedicate our activity to that:

00:12:04.354 --> 00:12:08.771
to prove that the agency
is necessary and possible,

00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:12.233
and ensures the quality
of the public discourse.

00:12:12.257 --> 00:12:15.400
Sometimes, the social inertia
seems endless,

00:12:15.424 --> 00:12:18.151
as infinite as the power
of the political world,

00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:22.148
as unbeatable as the power
of corporations,

00:12:22.172 --> 00:12:26.298
as unshakable as the media power
may also seem.

00:12:26.322 --> 00:12:29.280
But the power resides in the citizen.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.688
We delegate, but we do not abdicate.

00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:39.702
Civic causes applied
to just and specific causes

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:43.555
have proven successful over and over.

00:12:48.891 --> 00:12:55.580
Restoring the hard facts and the truth
in the public discourse is key,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.237
and a network of citizens
determined to restore the truth

00:13:01.558 --> 00:13:06.225
as the essential element in the fabric
of the public discourse can do it.

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:08.608
We will achieve it.

00:13:09.107 --> 00:13:11.195
We are achieving it.

00:13:12.298 --> 00:13:13.448
Thank you.

00:13:13.472 --> 00:13:15.044
(Applause)
