00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:03.667
Imagine a plant

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:07.405
that, like all plants, captures
the sun's energy during the day.

00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:10.614
But at night, it shines.

00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:16.736
Imagine a blood bank
for emergency transfusions,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.494
but made from artificial blood.

00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:21.907
And as a bonus it doesn't spread disease.

00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:25.940
Imagine an organism

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:29.251
able to capture carbon dioxide,

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:33.313
the one of the greenhouse effect gases,
and take it out of the atmosphere.

00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:38.282
But not only that, it also turns it
into a usable form of energy.

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:40.921
Stop dreaming.

00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:43.717
Welcome to synthetic biology.

00:00:44.937 --> 00:00:48.267
Most of you have probably never heard
of synthetic biology.

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.192
But you will hear of it in years to come.

00:00:51.908 --> 00:00:54.175
Biology is the study of life.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.701
And synthetic doesn't come from
"short" or "summed up",

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:02.213
but from artificial,
that which is not found in nature.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.529
As synthetic biologists
we design organisms

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:08.882
to help us accomplish something.

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:12.779
It can be something abstract,
like the study of life.

00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:17.893
Or tangible, urgent things
like treating an illness,

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:21.352
generating clean energy,
or detecting a pollutant.

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:27.417
The novelty is how we modify or create
new living organisms.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.718
And we achieve this by using,

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:34.875
designing and combining biobricks.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.167
They are biobricks like Rasti,
Lego or Mis Ladrillos.

00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:46.407
And each biobrick represents a function.

00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:52.151
We can design a biobrick
that when we put in a cell,

00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:54.724
it generates red color,

00:01:56.012 --> 00:01:58.122
the smell of bananas

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:00.377
or hemoglobin, the one of the blood.

00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:03.924
All biobricks are made of DNA,

00:02:03.948 --> 00:02:07.687
the material in which
genetic information is stored.

00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.443
And they are easy to combine
with each other.

00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:19.091
So, a researcher creates ten,
a hundred, ten thousand biobricks,

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:21.034
and shares them with the community.

00:02:22.104 --> 00:02:26.439
And each user takes them
and uses them to make their own organism

00:02:26.463 --> 00:02:28.130
with the function they wish.

00:02:28.154 --> 00:02:30.704
Not only do they use them,
they modify them,

00:02:30.728 --> 00:02:33.670
combine them, give them other use.

00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:36.240
They can create.

00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:39.140
And the most wonderful thing
for us who are passionate

00:02:39.164 --> 00:02:42.572
about the complexity of biology,
is that it works.

00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:48.377
OK, we have a basket full of functions

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.334
enclosed in biobricks, what do we do?

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:52.846
We play!

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.999
We assemble, disassemble,
put in, put out, recycle.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.901
Evolution recycles.

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:04.050
We synthetic biologists
come to be serial recyclers

00:03:04.074 --> 00:03:08.311
who reuse and combine biological modules

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:12.709
to make organisms with tailored functions.

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.518
This can generate some fear.

00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:19.331
Is it that we do what we want?

00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:21.800
No! There are many controls.

00:03:22.923 --> 00:03:26.860
For instance, the companies which make DNA

00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:30.741
are forbidden to make toxins or pathogens,

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:34.028
so that no biological weapons are created.

00:03:34.052 --> 00:03:36.851
And also the laboratories
that work in synthetic biology,

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:39.599
usually open their projects
to the community.

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.239
In my lab we receive visits
from industrial designers,

00:03:44.263 --> 00:03:46.612
artists, sociologists,

00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:49.589
and we explore
synthetic biology with them.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.581
The fire burns.

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.971
The water drowns.

00:03:54.995 --> 00:03:57.489
But we don't stop using them
because of that.

00:03:57.513 --> 00:04:01.444
It's just about making a responsible
and safe use of them.

00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:06.820
OK, but, what do we talk about
when we talk about organisms?

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:10.535
Human beings like pets.

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:15.632
Some of us like dogs,
other like cats, or plants.

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:19.719
Synthetic biologists
like bacteria and yeast.

00:04:19.743 --> 00:04:24.064
They are microscopic
so we have many, many of them.

00:04:25.124 --> 00:04:27.571
In ancient times we domesticated
microorganisms

00:04:27.595 --> 00:04:30.061
to help us produce food.

00:04:31.063 --> 00:04:34.290
Like bread, yogurt and beer.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.394
Today we also use them to make medicines,

00:04:38.418 --> 00:04:41.460
to produce energy, to study life.

00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:45.933
But those are not all possible uses.

00:04:45.957 --> 00:04:49.520
We could also use them to be more healthy,

00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:50.946
to live better.

00:04:51.487 --> 00:04:53.825
For instance, we could modify
some microorganisms

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.680
that live inside of us.

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:00.788
Yes, we have bacteria living inside of us.

00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:02.944
In fact, a healthy human being

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:07.578
has about ten times more bacteria
inside of them than human cells.

00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:10.909
Who could have wondered some years ago

00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:13.501
that bacteria could heal?

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.099
Today we are learning

00:05:16.123 --> 00:05:19.946
to understand these communities
of microbes that live inside of us

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.510
and how we can use them to live better.

00:05:24.548 --> 00:05:27.936
I want to tell you my story
with synthetic biology.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.873
The first time I heard
about synthetic biology,

00:05:32.848 --> 00:05:35.036
I thought it was a fraud.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.593
They invent a name to get money
or make themselves look interesting.

00:05:39.893 --> 00:05:43.419
But when I understood what it was about,

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.834
it amazed me.

00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:47.726
If with the old biotechnology

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.125
we could cut words from one organism
and paste them into another one

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:55.290
in a crafted and arduous way,

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.587
with synthetic biology

00:05:57.611 --> 00:06:00.236
we can write, rewrite
and edit a complete book.

00:06:01.287 --> 00:06:05.208
We have the full dictionary or,
even better, a complete library

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:06.891
in the computer.

00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:09.416
And we can combine words at will.

00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:14.351
One of the greatest milestones
of synthetic biology,

00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:18.306
was the production
of the first artificial genome.

00:06:18.686 --> 00:06:21.406
Many of you know that genetic information

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.594
is in the genome
and that we can make DNA in the lab.

00:06:25.707 --> 00:06:28.330
Four years ago, in a lab,

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:31.170
they made a complete genome

00:06:31.194 --> 00:06:34.767
from four bottles of chemical compounds.

00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:38.591
They later introduced it inside a bacteria

00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:41.571
turning it into a new species.

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:45.573
It's like changing the hard drive
of a computer

00:06:45.597 --> 00:06:47.998
and installing another operating system.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.381
What a tool!

00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:53.255
And you don't have to be
a super genius to use it.

00:06:53.855 --> 00:06:56.235
Most of the projects of synthetic biology

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.526
are powered by students.

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:04.025
From their enthusiasm and naivety
incredible projects come up.

00:07:05.203 --> 00:07:10.259
In 2013, with a group of students
from the University of Buenos Aires,

00:07:10.784 --> 00:07:14.785
we decided to study a problem
that hurt society

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:19.407
and that we could approach
with tools from synthetic biology.

00:07:20.108 --> 00:07:24.642
We decided on the serious problem
of access to drinking water.

00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:26.999
Around four million Argentinians

00:07:27.023 --> 00:07:30.370
consume arsenic-contaminated water
every day,

00:07:30.394 --> 00:07:33.787
in particular those who drink well water,
and they don't know this.

00:07:33.811 --> 00:07:38.245
Or those who know don't have
an easy way to measure it.

00:07:38.269 --> 00:07:42.402
So our goal was to design
an easy-to-use kit,

00:07:42.426 --> 00:07:44.149
like a pregnancy test,

00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:48.382
that allows the user to know
if the water from their well

00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:50.503
has arsenic or not.

00:07:51.234 --> 00:07:52.887
Remember the biobricks?

00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:56.600
Well, we combined the function
of detecting arsenic

00:07:56.624 --> 00:07:58.445
with the function of making color.

00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:01.024
We put them together and placed them
inside a bacteria

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:03.182
and we turned it into

00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:07.027
an arsenic detector, a biosensor.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.384
We did this project

00:08:09.408 --> 00:08:12.671
in the context of an international
competition of synthetic biology

00:08:12.695 --> 00:08:15.290
where our team won

00:08:15.314 --> 00:08:19.048
a gold medal and the award
for best theoretical model.

00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:22.103
But we didn't just stay with the model.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:25.261
We took field samples,
real ones, and it worked.

00:08:26.296 --> 00:08:31.637
The next step is to create a casing
that contains the bacteria

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:35.284
and be able to distribute this device.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.687
This is the current prototype.

00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:43.172
You put some drops of water in a cup...

00:08:43.196 --> 00:08:46.505
(Applause)

00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:56.834
You put some drops of water
in a cup, wait a couple of hours,

00:08:56.858 --> 00:09:00.297
and compare the color developed in the cup

00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:01.934
with the reference colors.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.042
Then you know how much arsenic
your well has.

00:09:06.632 --> 00:09:09.299
I like to see it as an inspiring model.

00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:13.929
When you know that something
cannot be done, you try.

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:16.675
But when you know that it can be done,
you go for more.

00:09:17.207 --> 00:09:21.203
Today there are companies
using synthetic biology,

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:24.445
to produce vanilla essence.

00:09:24.469 --> 00:09:28.984
They are using synthetic biology
to develop a cure for malaria,

00:09:29.008 --> 00:09:31.701
or to make a spider web.

00:09:31.725 --> 00:09:36.927
Today we can design organisms
that help us solve problems.

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:38.884
It's just about imagination.

00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:43.166
To imagine an organism
that helps us protect the environment.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.670
To imagine an organism
that helps us be more healthy.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.693
To imagine an organism
that helps us generate clean energy.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.362
Because we know that in synthetic biology,

00:09:57.386 --> 00:09:59.182
imagination is power.

00:09:59.207 --> 00:10:00.389
Thank you.

00:10:00.413 --> 00:10:02.770
(Applause)
