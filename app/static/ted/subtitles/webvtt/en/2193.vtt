00:00:03.141 --> 00:00:05.676
I grew up with my identical twin,

00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:08.925
who was an incredibly loving brother.

00:00:09.477 --> 00:00:12.549
Now, one thing about being a twin is,

00:00:12.573 --> 00:00:16.161
it makes you an expert
at spotting favoritism.

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:20.809
If his cookie was even
slightly bigger than my cookie,

00:00:21.723 --> 00:00:23.075
I had questions.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.517
And clearly, I wasn't starving.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.302
(Laughter)

00:00:28.873 --> 00:00:32.996
When I became a psychologist,
I began to notice favoritism

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.734
of a different kind;

00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:39.542
and that is, how much more we value
the body than we do the mind.

00:00:40.187 --> 00:00:46.221
I spent nine years at university
earning my doctorate in psychology,

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:50.499
and I can't tell you how many people
look at my business card and say,

00:00:50.523 --> 00:00:54.843
"Oh -- a psychologist.
So, not a real doctor,"

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:58.007
as if it should say that on my card.

00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:00.816
[Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist
(Not a Real Doctor)]

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.442
(Laughter)

00:01:02.952 --> 00:01:07.336
This favoritism we show the body
over the mind --

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.799
I see it everywhere.

00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:11.385
I recently was at a friend's house,

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.931
and their five-year-old
was getting ready for bed.

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:17.560
He was standing on a stool
by the sink, brushing his teeth,

00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:21.392
when he slipped and scratched his leg
on the stool when he fell.

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:24.968
He cried for a minute,
but then he got back up,

00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:28.506
got back on the stool, and reached out
for a box of Band-Aids

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.294
to put one on his cut.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.987
Now, this kid could barely
tie his shoelaces,

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:39.438
but he knew you have to cover a cut
so it doesn't become infected,

00:01:39.462 --> 00:01:42.798
and you have to care for your teeth
by brushing twice a day.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:46.345
We all know how to maintain
our physical health

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.884
and how to practice dental hygiene, right?

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.697
We've known it since
we were five years old.

00:01:52.442 --> 00:01:57.066
But what do we know about maintaining
our psychological health?

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.248
Well, nothing.

00:01:59.778 --> 00:02:03.568
What do we teach our children
about emotional hygiene?

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.945
Nothing.

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:11.215
How is it that we spend more time
taking care of our teeth

00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:13.379
than we do our minds?

00:02:14.202 --> 00:02:19.012
Why is it that our physical health
is so much more important to us

00:02:19.036 --> 00:02:20.705
than our psychological health?

00:02:21.393 --> 00:02:26.783
We sustain psychological injuries
even more often than we do physical ones,

00:02:26.807 --> 00:02:31.013
injuries like failure
or rejection or loneliness.

00:02:31.037 --> 00:02:33.808
And they can also get worse
if we ignore them,

00:02:33.832 --> 00:02:36.722
and they can impact our lives
in dramatic ways.

00:02:37.285 --> 00:02:41.465
And yet, even though there are
scientifically proven techniques

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.382
we could use to treat these
kinds of psychological injuries,

00:02:45.803 --> 00:02:46.962
we don't.

00:02:47.374 --> 00:02:49.915
It doesn't even occur to us
that we should.

00:02:50.434 --> 00:02:54.491
"Oh, you're feeling depressed?
Just shake it off; it's all in your head."

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.067
Can you imagine saying that
to somebody with a broken leg:

00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:00.677
"Oh, just walk it off;
it's all in your leg."

00:03:00.907 --> 00:03:02.852
(Laughter)

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.107
It is time we closed the gap

00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:09.219
between our physical
and our psychological health.

00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:11.362
It's time we made them more equal,

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:14.203
more like twins.

00:03:15.148 --> 00:03:18.921
Speaking of which,
my brother is also a psychologist.

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:21.376
So he's not a real doctor, either.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.128
(Laughter)

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:25.680
We didn't study together, though.

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:30.095
In fact, the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.865
is move across the Atlantic
to New York City

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.776
to get my doctorate in psychology.

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:38.661
We were apart then
for the first time in our lives,

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:41.970
and the separation was brutal
for both of us.

00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:45.542
But while he remained
among family and friends,

00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:47.623
I was alone in a new country.

00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:49.971
We missed each other terribly,

00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:53.148
but international phone calls
were really expensive then,

00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:57.601
and we could only afford to speak
for five minutes a week.

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.985
When our birthday rolled around,

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.561
it was the first
we wouldn't be spending together.

00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:03.914
We decided to splurge,

00:04:03.938 --> 00:04:06.104
and that week,
we would talk for 10 minutes.

00:04:06.128 --> 00:04:07.421
(Laughter)

00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:11.509
I spent the morning pacing around my room,
waiting for him to call --

00:04:12.154 --> 00:04:13.311
and waiting ...

00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:15.280
and waiting.

00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:17.248
But the phone didn't ring.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.143
Given the time difference, I assumed,

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:22.465
"OK, he's out with friends,
he'll call later."

00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:23.997
There were no cell phones then.

00:04:24.805 --> 00:04:26.108
But he didn't.

00:04:27.171 --> 00:04:31.675
And I began to realize
that after being away for over 10 months,

00:04:32.253 --> 00:04:35.088
he no longer missed me
the way I missed him.

00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:38.531
I knew he would call in the morning,

00:04:38.555 --> 00:04:43.070
but that night was one of the saddest
and longest nights of my life.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:46.586
I woke up the next morning.

00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:48.335
I glanced down at the phone,

00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:51.113
and I realized
I had kicked it off the hook

00:04:51.137 --> 00:04:52.814
when pacing the day before.

00:04:54.612 --> 00:04:56.263
I stumbled out of bed,

00:04:56.287 --> 00:04:59.500
I put the phone back on the receiver,
and it rang a second later.

00:04:59.764 --> 00:05:01.424
And it was my brother,

00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:03.116
and boy, was he pissed.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.344
(Laughter)

00:05:05.368 --> 00:05:08.618
It was the saddest and longest
night of his life as well.

00:05:09.126 --> 00:05:11.537
Now, I tried to explain
what happened, but he said,

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:12.780
"I don't understand.

00:05:12.804 --> 00:05:14.719
If you saw I wasn't calling you,

00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:17.559
why didn't you just pick up
the phone and call me?"

00:05:19.057 --> 00:05:20.237
He was right.

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:22.354
Why didn't I call him?

00:05:23.187 --> 00:05:24.861
I didn't have an answer then.

00:05:25.608 --> 00:05:27.059
But I do today,

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:28.404
and it's a simple one:

00:05:29.688 --> 00:05:30.861
loneliness.

00:05:31.948 --> 00:05:35.997
Loneliness creates a deep
psychological wound,

00:05:36.021 --> 00:05:39.721
one that distorts our perceptions
and scrambles our thinking.

00:05:40.228 --> 00:05:45.498
It makes us believe that those around us
care much less than they actually do.

00:05:46.034 --> 00:05:48.328
It make us really afraid to reach out,

00:05:48.352 --> 00:05:52.442
because why set yourself up
for rejection and heartache

00:05:52.466 --> 00:05:55.519
when your heart is already aching
more than you can stand?

00:05:56.432 --> 00:05:59.515
I was in the grips
of real loneliness back then,

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.408
but I was surrounded by people all day,
so it never occurred to me.

00:06:04.273 --> 00:06:07.892
But loneliness is defined
purely subjectively.

00:06:08.415 --> 00:06:14.179
It depends solely on whether you feel
emotionally or socially disconnected

00:06:14.203 --> 00:06:15.361
from those around you.

00:06:15.385 --> 00:06:16.542
And I did.

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:22.515
There is a lot of research on loneliness,
and all of it is horrifying.

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:25.599
Loneliness won't just make you miserable;

00:06:26.307 --> 00:06:27.457
it will kill you.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:28.960
I'm not kidding.

00:06:28.984 --> 00:06:32.575
Chronic loneliness increases
your likelihood of an early death

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.495
by 14 percent.

00:06:34.902 --> 00:06:36.267
Fourteen percent!

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.595
Loneliness causes high blood pressure,

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:40.784
high cholesterol.

00:06:40.808 --> 00:06:44.533
It even suppress the functioning
of your immune system,

00:06:44.557 --> 00:06:48.589
making you vulnerable to all kinds
of illnesses and diseases.

00:06:48.613 --> 00:06:52.151
In fact, scientists have concluded
that taken together,

00:06:52.175 --> 00:06:55.831
chronic loneliness
poses as significant a risk

00:06:55.855 --> 00:06:58.624
for your long-term health and longevity

00:06:58.648 --> 00:06:59.996
as cigarette smoking.

00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:04.571
Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
saying, "This could kill you."

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:06.777
But loneliness doesn't.

00:07:07.405 --> 00:07:09.260
And that's why it's so important

00:07:09.284 --> 00:07:12.347
that we prioritize
our psychological health,

00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:15.073
that we practice emotional hygiene.

00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:18.358
Because you can't treat
a psychological wound

00:07:18.382 --> 00:07:20.401
if you don't even know you're injured.

00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:24.920
Loneliness isn't the only
psychological wound

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.833
that distorts our perceptions
and misleads us.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.803
Failure does that as well.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:34.081
I once visited a day care center,

00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:38.592
where I saw three toddlers
play with identical plastic toys.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.179
You had to slide the red button,
and a cute doggie would pop out.

00:07:43.817 --> 00:07:48.388
One little girl tried pulling
the purple button, then pushing it,

00:07:48.412 --> 00:07:51.206
and then she just sat back
and looked at the box

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.005
with her lower lip trembling.

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:56.080
The little boy next to her
watched this happen,

00:07:56.104 --> 00:07:59.939
then turned to his box and burst
into tears without even touching it.

00:08:01.141 --> 00:08:04.583
Meanwhile, another little girl
tried everything she could think of

00:08:04.607 --> 00:08:06.391
until she slid the red button,

00:08:06.415 --> 00:08:09.893
the cute doggie popped out,
and she squealed with delight.

00:08:10.421 --> 00:08:14.209
So: three toddlers
with identical plastic toys,

00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:17.344
but with very different
reactions to failure.

00:08:17.893 --> 00:08:21.788
The first two toddlers were perfectly
capable of sliding a red button.

00:08:22.455 --> 00:08:25.566
The only thing that prevented
them from succeeding

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.265
was that their mind tricked them
into believing they could not.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.624
Now, adults get tricked this way
as well, all the time.

00:08:34.028 --> 00:08:39.181
In fact, we all have a default set
of feelings and beliefs

00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:43.300
that gets triggered whenever
we encounter frustrations and setbacks.

00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:46.180
Are you aware of how
your mind reacts to failure?

00:08:46.783 --> 00:08:48.009
You need to be.

00:08:48.033 --> 00:08:52.406
Because if your mind tries to convince you
you're incapable of something,

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.939
and you believe it,

00:08:53.963 --> 00:08:57.237
then like those two toddlers,
you'll begin to feel helpless

00:08:57.261 --> 00:09:00.520
and you'll stop trying too soon,
or you won't even try at all.

00:09:00.859 --> 00:09:03.943
And then you'll be even more
convinced you can't succeed.

00:09:03.967 --> 00:09:08.561
You see, that's why so many people
function below their actual potential.

00:09:08.951 --> 00:09:12.235
Because somewhere along the way,
sometimes a single failure

00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:15.687
convinced them that they couldn't
succeed, and they believed it.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.160
Once we become convinced of something,
it's very difficult to change our mind.

00:09:21.831 --> 00:09:25.674
I learned that lesson the hard way
when I was a teenager with my brother.

00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:29.366
We were driving with friends
down a dark road at night,

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.070
when a police car stopped us.

00:09:31.094 --> 00:09:34.657
There had been a robbery in the area
and they were looking for suspects.

00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:38.425
The officer approached the car,
and shined his flashlight on the driver,

00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:40.847
then on my brother in the front seat,

00:09:41.285 --> 00:09:42.451
and then on me.

00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:44.859
And his eyes opened wide and he said,

00:09:45.283 --> 00:09:47.124
"Where have I seen your face before?"

00:09:47.148 --> 00:09:49.761
(Laughter)

00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:51.226
And I said,

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:53.358
"In the front seat."

00:09:53.382 --> 00:09:55.869
(Laughter)

00:09:56.405 --> 00:09:58.525
But that made no sense to him whatsoever,

00:09:58.549 --> 00:10:00.488
so now he thought I was on drugs.

00:10:00.512 --> 00:10:02.072
(Laughter)

00:10:02.096 --> 00:10:04.667
So he drags me out of the car,
he searches me,

00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:06.518
he marches me over to the police car,

00:10:06.542 --> 00:10:10.042
and only when he verified
I didn't have a police record,

00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:13.576
could I show him
I had a twin in the front seat.

00:10:14.417 --> 00:10:16.189
But even as we were driving away,

00:10:16.213 --> 00:10:19.201
you could see by the look
on his face he was convinced

00:10:19.225 --> 00:10:21.269
that I was getting away with something.

00:10:21.293 --> 00:10:22.955
(Laughter)

00:10:23.293 --> 00:10:26.645
Our mind is hard to change
once we become convinced.

00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:30.109
So it might be very natural
to feel demoralized

00:10:30.133 --> 00:10:31.820
and defeated after you fail.

00:10:31.844 --> 00:10:36.218
But you cannot allow yourself
to become convinced you can't succeed.

00:10:36.242 --> 00:10:39.090
You have to fight
feelings of helplessness.

00:10:39.114 --> 00:10:42.369
You have to gain control
over the situation.

00:10:42.393 --> 00:10:44.985
And you have to break
this kind of negative cycle

00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:46.228
before it begins.

00:10:46.252 --> 00:10:48.167
[Stop Emotional Bleeding]

00:10:48.191 --> 00:10:50.602
Our minds and our feelings --

00:10:50.626 --> 00:10:53.967
they're not the trustworthy friends
we thought they were.

00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:56.833
They're more like a really moody friend,

00:10:56.857 --> 00:11:01.540
who can be totally supportive one minute,
and really unpleasant the next.

00:11:02.175 --> 00:11:05.858
I once worked with this woman
who, after 20 years marriage

00:11:05.882 --> 00:11:08.287
and an extremely ugly divorce,

00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:10.548
was finally ready for her first date.

00:11:10.572 --> 00:11:12.595
She had met this guy online,

00:11:12.619 --> 00:11:15.049
and he seemed nice
and he seemed successful,

00:11:15.073 --> 00:11:18.605
and most importantly,
he seemed really into her.

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:21.387
So she was very excited,
she bought a new dress,

00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:25.002
and they met at an upscale
New York City bar for a drink.

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:29.447
Ten minutes into the date,
the man stands up and says,

00:11:29.471 --> 00:11:31.330
"I'm not interested," and walks out.

00:11:33.798 --> 00:11:36.913
Rejection is extremely painful.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.646
The woman was so hurt she couldn't move.

00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:41.801
All she could do was call a friend.

00:11:42.198 --> 00:11:46.388
Here's what the friend said:
"Well, what do you expect?

00:11:46.816 --> 00:11:50.088
You have big hips,
you have nothing interesting to say.

00:11:50.493 --> 00:11:53.027
Why would a handsome,
successful man like that

00:11:53.051 --> 00:11:55.259
ever go out with a loser like you?"

00:11:57.092 --> 00:12:00.103
Shocking, right, that a friend
could be so cruel?

00:12:00.531 --> 00:12:03.133
But it would be much less shocking

00:12:03.157 --> 00:12:05.623
if I told you it wasn't
the friend who said that.

00:12:05.957 --> 00:12:07.976
It's what the woman said to herself.

00:12:08.893 --> 00:12:10.714
And that's something we all do,

00:12:11.334 --> 00:12:13.227
especially after a rejection.

00:12:13.251 --> 00:12:16.696
We all start thinking of all our faults
and all our shortcomings,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.886
what we wish we were,
what we wish we weren't.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.265
We call ourselves names.

00:12:20.289 --> 00:12:22.775
Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it.

00:12:23.274 --> 00:12:24.896
And it's interesting that we do,

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.783
because our self-esteem
is already hurting.

00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:30.761
Why would we want to go
and damage it even further?

00:12:31.236 --> 00:12:33.858
We wouldn't make a physical injury
worse on purpose.

00:12:33.882 --> 00:12:36.784
You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
and decide, "Oh! I know --

00:12:36.808 --> 00:12:40.344
I'm going to take a knife and see
how much deeper I can make it."

00:12:40.368 --> 00:12:43.949
But we do that with psychological
injuries all the time.

00:12:43.973 --> 00:12:47.068
Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene.

00:12:47.442 --> 00:12:50.140
Because we don't prioritize
our psychological health.

00:12:50.862 --> 00:12:54.422
We know from dozens of studies
that when your self-esteem is lower,

00:12:54.446 --> 00:12:57.907
you are more vulnerable
to stress and to anxiety;

00:12:57.931 --> 00:13:00.605
that failures and rejections hurt more,

00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:02.912
and it takes longer to recover from them.

00:13:03.507 --> 00:13:06.759
So when you get rejected,
the first thing you should be doing

00:13:06.783 --> 00:13:08.844
is to revive your self-esteem,

00:13:08.868 --> 00:13:11.827
not join Fight Club
and beat it into a pulp.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.936
When you're in emotional pain,

00:13:15.459 --> 00:13:18.497
treat yourself with the same compassion

00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:21.154
you would expect from a truly good friend.

00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:23.249
[Protect Your Self-Esteem]

00:13:23.273 --> 00:13:27.574
We have to catch our unhealthy
psychological habits and change them.

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:31.816
And one of unhealthiest and most common
is called rumination.

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.728
To ruminate means to chew over.

00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:36.941
It's when your boss yells at you

00:13:36.965 --> 00:13:39.586
or your professor
makes you feel stupid in class,

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.859
or you have big fight with a friend

00:13:41.883 --> 00:13:45.944
and you just can't stop replaying
the scene in your head for days,

00:13:45.968 --> 00:13:48.357
sometimes for weeks on end.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:53.493
Now, ruminating about upsetting events
in this way can easily become a habit,

00:13:53.517 --> 00:13:54.966
and it's a very costly one,

00:13:55.431 --> 00:14:00.151
because by spending so much time focused
on upsetting and negative thoughts,

00:14:00.175 --> 00:14:03.124
you are actually putting yourself
at significant risk

00:14:03.148 --> 00:14:04.885
for developing clinical depression,

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.636
alcoholism,

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.822
eating disorders,

00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:09.952
and even cardiovascular disease.

00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:11.874
The problem is,

00:14:11.898 --> 00:14:15.839
the urge to ruminate can feel
really strong and really important,

00:14:15.863 --> 00:14:17.946
so it's a difficult habit to stop.

00:14:18.804 --> 00:14:20.427
I know this for a fact,

00:14:20.451 --> 00:14:23.987
because a little over a year ago,
I developed the habit myself.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:30.101
You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:14:30.965 --> 00:14:33.109
His cancer was extremely aggressive.

00:14:33.133 --> 00:14:36.199
He had visible tumors all over his body.

00:14:36.904 --> 00:14:40.260
And he had to start a harsh course
of chemotherapy.

00:14:41.627 --> 00:14:45.677
And I couldn't stop thinking
about what he was going through.

00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:49.306
I couldn't stop thinking
about how much he was suffering,

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:53.591
even though he never complained, not once.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.997
He had this incredibly positive attitude.

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:59.508
His psychological health was amazing.

00:15:00.212 --> 00:15:04.327
I was physically healthy,
but psychologically, I was a mess.

00:15:05.303 --> 00:15:06.544
But I knew what to do.

00:15:06.568 --> 00:15:11.219
Studies tell us that even a two-minute
distraction is sufficient

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.697
to break the urge to ruminate
in that moment.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.758
And so each time I had a worrying,
upsetting, negative thought,

00:15:17.782 --> 00:15:22.137
I forced myself to concentrate
on something else until the urge passed.

00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:26.626
And within one week,
my whole outlook changed

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.378
and became more positive and more hopeful.

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:31.243
[Battle Negative Thinking]

00:15:31.267 --> 00:15:35.710
Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
my brother had a CAT scan,

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:38.524
and I was by his side
when he got the results.

00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:40.964
All the tumors were gone.

00:15:42.297 --> 00:15:45.271
He still had three more rounds
of chemotherapy to go,

00:15:45.295 --> 00:15:46.875
but we knew he would recover.

00:15:47.659 --> 00:15:50.518
This picture was taken two weeks ago.

00:15:53.807 --> 00:15:56.312
By taking action when you're lonely,

00:15:56.978 --> 00:15:59.698
by changing your responses to failure,

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:02.621
by protecting your self-esteem,

00:16:02.645 --> 00:16:04.927
by battling negative thinking,

00:16:04.951 --> 00:16:08.180
you won't just heal
your psychological wounds,

00:16:08.204 --> 00:16:10.763
you will build emotional resilience,

00:16:10.787 --> 00:16:12.015
you will thrive.

00:16:12.664 --> 00:16:16.700
A hundred years ago, people began
practicing personal hygiene,

00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:21.518
and life expectancy rates
rose by over 50 percent

00:16:21.542 --> 00:16:23.260
in just a matter of decades.

00:16:23.947 --> 00:16:28.036
I believe our quality of life
could rise just as dramatically

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.369
if we all began practicing
emotional hygiene.

00:16:32.194 --> 00:16:34.257
Can you imagine
what the world would be like

00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:36.817
if everyone was psychologically healthier?

00:16:36.841 --> 00:16:39.762
If there were less loneliness
and less depression?

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.807
If people knew how to overcome failure?

00:16:43.224 --> 00:16:46.489
If they felt better about themselves
and more empowered?

00:16:46.513 --> 00:16:48.914
If they were happier and more fulfilled?

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.037
I can, because that's the world
I want to live in.

00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:57.707
And that's the world
my brother wants to live in as well.

00:16:58.371 --> 00:17:03.271
And if you just become informed
and change a few simple habits, well --

00:17:04.001 --> 00:17:06.358
that's the world we can all live in.

00:17:07.373 --> 00:17:08.539
Thank you very much.
