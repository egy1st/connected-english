00:00:00.653 --> 00:00:02.265
In the mid-'90s,

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:04.872
the CDC and Kaiser Permanente


00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:08.992
discovered an exposure
that dramatically increased the risk

00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:14.413
for seven out of 10 of the leading
causes of death in the United States.

00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:18.344
In high doses, it affects
brain development,

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:22.011
the immune system, hormonal systems,

00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:26.684
and even the way our DNA
is read and transcribed.

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:30.205
Folks who are exposed in very high doses

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:34.292
have triple the lifetime risk
of heart disease and lung cancer

00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:38.951
and a 20-year difference
in life expectancy.

00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:45.593
And yet, doctors today are not trained
in routine screening or treatment.

00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:51.558
Now, the exposure I'm talking about is
not a pesticide or a packaging chemical.

00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:53.988
It's childhood trauma.

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:57.686
Okay. What kind of trauma
am I talking about here?

00:00:57.686 --> 00:01:01.995
I'm not talking about failing a test
or losing a basketball game.

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:06.736
I am talking about threats
that are so severe or pervasive

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:11.333
that they literally get under our skin
and change our physiology:

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.725
things like abuse or neglect,

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:17.495
or growing up with a parent 
who struggles with mental illness

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:19.477
or substance dependence.

00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:21.444
Now, for a long time,

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:24.441
I viewed these things in the way 
I was trained to view them,

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:28.533
either as a social problem --
refer to social services --

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:33.116
or as a mental health problem --
refer to mental health services.

00:01:34.088 --> 00:01:39.776
And then something happened
to make me rethink my entire approach.

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:41.648
When I finished my residency,

00:01:41.648 --> 00:01:45.372
I wanted to go someplace
where I felt really needed,

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:48.530
someplace where I could make a difference.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.646
So I came to work for
California Pacific Medical Center,

00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:55.472
one of the best private hospitals
in Northern California,

00:01:55.472 --> 00:02:00.000
and together, we opened a clinic
in Bayview-Hunters Point,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.733
one of the poorest, most underserved
neighborhoods in San Francisco.

00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:06.118
Now, prior to that point,

00:02:06.118 --> 00:02:08.980
there had been only
one pediatrician in all of Bayview

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.423
to serve more than 10,000 children,

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:17.072
so we hung a shingle, and we were able
to provide top-quality care

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:19.057
regardless of ability to pay.

00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:23.219
It was so cool. We targeted
the typical health disparities:

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:28.026
access to care, immunization rates,
asthma hospitalization rates,

00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:30.183
and we hit all of our numbers.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.796
We felt very proud of ourselves.

00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:36.627
But then I started noticing
a disturbing trend.

00:02:36.627 --> 00:02:40.517
A lot of kids were being
referred to me for ADHD,

00:02:40.517 --> 00:02:43.514
or Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder,

00:02:43.514 --> 00:02:48.396
but when I actually did
a thorough history and physical,

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:51.595
what I found was that
for most of my patients,

00:02:51.595 --> 00:02:54.634
I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD.

00:02:55.264 --> 00:03:00.834
Most of the kids I was seeing
had experienced such severe trauma

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:04.224
that it felt like something else
was going on.

00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:08.206
Somehow I was missing something important.

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:13.317
Now, before I did my residency,
I did a master's degree in public health,

00:03:13.317 --> 00:03:16.410
and one of the things that they teach you
in public health school

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.295
is that if you're a doctor

00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:22.079
and you see 100 kids
that all drink from the same well,

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.477
and 98 of them develop diarrhea,

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:27.763
you can go ahead
and write that prescription

00:03:27.763 --> 00:03:32.092
for dose after dose
after dose of antibiotics,

00:03:32.092 --> 00:03:37.915
or you can walk over and say,
"What the hell is in this well?"

00:03:37.915 --> 00:03:41.708
So I began reading everything that
I could get my hands on

00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:44.262
about how exposure to adversity

00:03:44.262 --> 00:03:47.741
affects the developing brains
and bodies of children.

00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:51.646
And then one day,
my colleague walked into my office,

00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:56.060
and he said, "Dr. Burke,
have you seen this?"

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.902
In his hand was a copy
of a research study

00:04:00.902 --> 00:04:04.119
called the Adverse Childhood
Experiences Study.

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:11.692
That day changed my clinical practice
and ultimately my career.

00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:14.573
The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study

00:04:14.573 --> 00:04:17.805
is something that everybody
needs to know about.

00:04:17.805 --> 00:04:23.136
It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser
and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC,

00:04:23.136 --> 00:04:31.334
and together, they asked 17,500 adults
about their history of exposure

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:36.051
to what they called "adverse 
childhood experiences," or ACEs.

00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:40.838
Those include physical, emotional,
or sexual abuse;

00:04:40.838 --> 00:04:44.764
physical or emotional neglect;

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:47.858
parental mental illness,
substance dependence, incarceration;

00:04:47.858 --> 00:04:50.637
parental separation or divorce;

00:04:50.637 --> 00:04:53.172
or domestic violence.

00:04:53.172 --> 00:04:57.608
For every yes, you would get
a point on your ACE score.

00:04:57.608 --> 00:04:59.116
And then what they did

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:04.366
was they correlated these ACE scores
against health outcomes.

00:05:04.836 --> 00:05:07.673
What they found was striking.

00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:08.968
Two things:

00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:13.230
Number one, ACEs are incredibly common.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:20.034
Sixty-seven percent of the population
had at least one ACE,

00:05:20.034 --> 00:05:25.873
and 12.6 percent, one in eight,
had four or more ACEs.

00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:28.971
The second thing that they found

00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:32.433
was that there was
a dose-response relationship

00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:37.033
between ACEs and health outcomes:

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:40.952
the higher your ACE score,
the worse your health outcomes.

00:05:40.952 --> 00:05:44.203
For a person with an ACE score
of four or more,

00:05:44.203 --> 00:05:47.895
their relative risk of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease

00:05:47.895 --> 00:05:52.446
was two and a half times that
of someone with an ACE score of zero.

00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:56.370
For hepatitis, it was also
two and a half times.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.690
For depression, it was
four and a half times.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.123
For suicidality, it was 12 times.

00:06:03.123 --> 00:06:06.288
A person with an ACE score
of seven or more

00:06:06.288 --> 00:06:10.858
had triple the lifetime risk
of lung cancer

00:06:10.858 --> 00:06:14.829
and three and a half times the risk
of ischemic heart disease,

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:17.974
the number one killer
in the United States of America.

00:06:19.124 --> 00:06:21.887
Well, of course this makes sense.

00:06:21.887 --> 00:06:26.554
Some people looked at this data
and they said, "Come on.

00:06:26.554 --> 00:06:31.376
You have a rough childhood,
you're more likely to drink and smoke

00:06:31.376 --> 00:06:34.191
and do all these things
that are going to ruin your health.

00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.986
This isn't science.
This is just bad behavior."

00:06:38.486 --> 00:06:43.725
It turns out this is exactly
where the science comes in.

00:06:43.725 --> 00:06:48.379
We now understand
better than we ever have before

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.631
how exposure to early adversity

00:06:51.631 --> 00:06:54.719
affects the developing brains
and bodies of children.

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:57.505
It affects areas like
the nucleus accumbens,

00:06:57.505 --> 00:07:00.036
the pleasure and reward
center of the brain

00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:02.682
that is implicated
in substance dependence.

00:07:02.682 --> 00:07:05.404
It inhibits the prefrontal cortex,

00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:09.461
which is necessary for impulse control
and executive function,

00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:11.528
a critical area for learning.

00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:13.216
And on MRI scans,

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:17.204
we see measurable differences
in the amygdala,

00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:19.846
the brain's fear response center.

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:23.766
So there are real neurologic reasons

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:27.296
why folks exposed
to high doses of adversity

00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:30.593
are more likely to engage
in high-risk behavior,

00:07:30.593 --> 00:07:32.497
and that's important to know.

00:07:32.497 --> 00:07:38.116
But it turns out that even if you don't
engage in any high-risk behavior,

00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:43.257
you're still more likely
to develop heart disease or cancer.

00:07:44.101 --> 00:07:50.026
The reason for this has to do with
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis,

00:07:50.027 --> 00:07:53.696
the brain's and body's
stress response system

00:07:53.696 --> 00:07:57.476
that governs our fight-or-flight response.

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:59.431
How does it work?

00:07:59.431 --> 00:08:03.169
Well, imagine you're walking
in the forest and you see a bear.

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:07.326
Immediately, your hypothalamus
sends a signal to your pituitary,

00:08:07.326 --> 00:08:09.927
which sends a signal 
to your adrenal gland that says,

00:08:09.927 --> 00:08:13.478
"Release stress hormones!
Adrenaline! Cortisol!"

00:08:13.478 --> 00:08:16.099
And so your heart starts to pound,

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:18.233
Your pupils dilate, your airways open up,

00:08:18.234 --> 00:08:24.482
and you are ready to either
fight that bear or run from the bear.

00:08:24.482 --> 00:08:26.798
And that is wonderful

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:30.289
if you're in a forest
and there's a bear.

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:32.843
(Laughter)

00:08:32.843 --> 00:08:38.256
But the problem is what happens
when the bear comes home every night,

00:08:38.256 --> 00:08:43.904
and this system is activated
over and over and over again,

00:08:43.904 --> 00:08:48.408
and it goes from being
adaptive, or life-saving,

00:08:48.408 --> 00:08:52.533
to maladaptive, or health-damaging.

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:58.036
Children are especially sensitive
to this repeated stress activation,

00:08:58.036 --> 00:09:01.270
because their brains and bodies
are just developing.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.075
High doses of adversity not only affect
brain structure and function,

00:09:08.075 --> 00:09:11.301
they affect the developing immune system,

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:14.144
developing hormonal systems,

00:09:14.144 --> 00:09:18.833
and even the way our DNA
is read and transcribed.

00:09:20.413 --> 00:09:24.871
So for me, this information
threw my old training out the window,

00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:28.818
because when we understand
the mechanism of a disease,

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:33.555
when we know not only
which pathways are disrupted, but how,

00:09:33.555 --> 00:09:38.216
then as doctors, it is our job
to use this science

00:09:38.216 --> 00:09:40.845
for prevention and treatment.

00:09:40.845 --> 00:09:42.538
That's what we do.

00:09:42.728 --> 00:09:46.791
So in San Francisco, we created
the Center for Youth Wellness

00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:52.224
to prevent, screen and heal the impacts
of ACEs and toxic stress.

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:56.807
We started simply with routine screening
of every one of our kids

00:09:56.807 --> 00:09:58.334
at their regular physical,

00:09:58.334 --> 00:10:03.038
because I know that if my patient 
has an ACE score of 4,

00:10:03.038 --> 00:10:07.595
she's two and a half times as likely
to develop hepatitis or COPD,

00:10:07.595 --> 00:10:10.497
she's four and half times as likely
to become depressed,

00:10:10.497 --> 00:10:14.560
and she's 12 times as likely
to attempt to take her own life

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.860
as my patient with zero ACEs.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.519
I know that when she's in my exam room.

00:10:20.249 --> 00:10:23.013
For our patients who do screen positive,

00:10:23.013 --> 00:10:28.235
we have a multidisciplinary treatment team
that works to reduce the dose of adversity

00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:34.118
and treat symptoms using best practices,
including home visits, care coordination,

00:10:34.118 --> 00:10:38.032
mental health care, nutrition,

00:10:38.032 --> 00:10:42.747
holistic interventions, and yes,
medication when necessary.

00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:47.436
But we also educate parents
about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress

00:10:47.436 --> 00:10:52.946
the same way you would for covering
electrical outlets, or lead poisoning,

00:10:52.946 --> 00:10:56.886
and we tailor the care
of our asthmatics and our diabetics

00:10:56.886 --> 00:11:01.344
in a way that recognizes that they may
need more aggressive treatment,

00:11:01.344 --> 00:11:05.771
given the changes to their hormonal
and immune systems.

00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:09.863
So the other thing that happens
when you understand this science

00:11:09.863 --> 00:11:12.861
is that you want to shout it
from the rooftops,

00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:17.191
because this isn't just an issue
for kids in Bayview.

00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:20.825
I figured the minute
that everybody else heard about this,

00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:24.308
it would be routine screening,
multi-disciplinary treatment teams,

00:11:24.308 --> 00:11:29.105
and it would be a race to the most
effective clinical treatment protocols.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:33.225
Yeah. That did not happen.

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:36.080
And that was a huge learning for me.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.887
What I had thought of as simply
best clinical practice

00:11:40.887 --> 00:11:44.445
I now understand to be a movement.

00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:47.475
In the words of Dr. Robert Block,

00:11:47.475 --> 00:11:51.176
the former President
of the American Academy of Pediatrics,

00:11:51.176 --> 00:11:54.128
"Adverse childhood experiences

00:11:54.128 --> 00:11:59.138
are the single greatest
unaddressed public health threat

00:11:59.138 --> 00:12:01.387
facing our nation today."

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:06.033
And for a lot of people,
that's a terrifying prospect.

00:12:06.033 --> 00:12:11.838
The scope and scale of the problem
seems so large that it feels overwhelming

00:12:11.838 --> 00:12:14.462
to think about how we might approach it.

00:12:14.462 --> 00:12:18.869
But for me, that's actually
where the hopes lies,

00:12:18.869 --> 00:12:21.533
because when we have the right framework,

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:26.790
when we recognize this to be
a public health crisis,

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:31.794
then we can begin to use the right 
tool kit to come up with solutions.

00:12:31.794 --> 00:12:35.522
From tobacco to lead poisoning 
to HIV/AIDS,

00:12:35.522 --> 00:12:40.535
the United States actually has
quite a strong track record

00:12:40.535 --> 00:12:43.439
with addressing public health problems,

00:12:43.439 --> 00:12:48.942
but replicating those successes
with ACEs and toxic stress

00:12:48.942 --> 00:12:53.539
is going to take determination
and commitment,

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:57.511
and when I look at what
our nation's response has been so far,

00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:59.355
I wonder,

00:12:59.355 --> 00:13:03.154
why haven't we taken this more seriously?

00:13:03.154 --> 00:13:06.976
You know, at first I thought
that we marginalized the issue

00:13:06.976 --> 00:13:08.900
because it doesn't apply to us.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.198
That's an issue for those kids
in those neighborhoods.

00:13:12.198 --> 00:13:16.387
Which is weird, because the data
doesn't bear that out.

00:13:16.387 --> 00:13:20.520
The original ACEs study
was done in a population

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.307
that was 70 percent Caucasian,

00:13:23.307 --> 00:13:26.465
70 percent college-educated.

00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:29.947
But then, the more I talked to folks,

00:13:29.947 --> 00:13:34.454
I'm beginning to think that maybe
I had it completely backwards.

00:13:35.334 --> 00:13:41.278
If I were to ask
how many people in this room

00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:44.957
grew up with a family member
who suffered from mental illness,

00:13:45.587 --> 00:13:48.053
I bet a few hands would go up.

00:13:48.053 --> 00:13:53.754
And then if I were to ask how many folks
had a parent who maybe drank too much,

00:13:53.754 --> 00:13:58.267
or who really believed that
if you spare the rod, you spoil the child,

00:13:59.077 --> 00:14:02.195
I bet a few more hands would go up.

00:14:02.195 --> 00:14:07.276
Even in this room, this is an issue
that touches many of us,

00:14:07.276 --> 00:14:10.665
and I am beginning to believe
that we marginalize the issue

00:14:10.665 --> 00:14:13.261
because it does apply to us.

00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:16.121
Maybe it's easier to see
in other zip codes

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:19.024
because we don't want to look at it.

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:21.102
We'd rather be sick.

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:28.440
Fortunately, scientific advances
and, frankly, economic realities

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.484
make that option less viable every day.

00:14:33.524 --> 00:14:35.111
The science is clear:

00:14:35.991 --> 00:14:40.940
Early adversity dramatically affects
health across a lifetime.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:46.632
Today, we are beginning to understand
how to interrupt the progression

00:14:46.632 --> 00:14:50.933
from early adversity
to disease and early death,

00:14:50.933 --> 00:14:53.458
and 30 years from now,

00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:55.966
the child who has a high ACE score

00:14:55.966 --> 00:14:59.071
and whose behavioral symptoms
go unrecognized,

00:14:59.071 --> 00:15:01.771
whose asthma management
is not connected,

00:15:01.771 --> 00:15:04.975
and who goes on to develop
high blood pressure

00:15:04.975 --> 00:15:07.819
and early heart disease or cancer

00:15:07.819 --> 00:15:12.963
will be just as anomalous
as a six-month mortality from HIV/AIDS.

00:15:12.963 --> 00:15:17.448
People will look at that situation
and say, "What the heck happened there?"

00:15:18.468 --> 00:15:20.755
This is treatable.

00:15:20.755 --> 00:15:23.527
This is beatable.

00:15:23.527 --> 00:15:27.690
The single most important thing
that we need today

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.017
is the courage to look
this problem in the face

00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:36.089
and say, this is real
and this is all of us.

00:15:36.089 --> 00:15:40.826
I believe that we are the movement.

00:15:40.826 --> 00:15:42.204
Thank you.

00:15:42.204 --> 00:15:45.667
(Applause)
