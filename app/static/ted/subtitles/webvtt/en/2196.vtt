00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:05.746
Dearest friends,
thank you for welcoming me

00:00:06.492 --> 00:00:09.762
in the name of all "Abuelas
de Plaza de Mayo"; I'm just one of them.

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:15.080
And my story is the same
as my fellow women:

00:00:15.107 --> 00:00:21.002
we got together deeply pained,
not knowing what to do,

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:25.334
lacking information, surrounded by danger,

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.729
and leaving everything behind.

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:33.717
I was a school principal but I retired
to search for a disappeared loved one,

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:38.778
a child of mine, a daughter,
but it was a double search

00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:43.592
because my daughter
was expecting a baby.

00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:50.622
At my age, I was born in the 1930s,
dictatorships were part of my education,

00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:54.544
but I never thought

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:59.173
that the last civic-military dictatorship

00:00:59.174 --> 00:01:03.042
would bring such a horrifying
and sinister a project.

00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:05.021
I had to educate myself about it,

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:08.459
I had to learn about it and to understand,

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.407
but we did something wonderful

00:01:11.408 --> 00:01:15.510
which allowed us to keep on fighting:

00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.474
we joined together.

00:01:18.874 --> 00:01:22.758
Even if we stood alone, when we saw
there were other mothers out there,

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.523
with same faces and feeling the same pain,
we dared to ask what their stories were

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:31.295
and so we decided
to search for answers together.

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:35.648
This is how this group took shape

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:39.591
37 years ago.

00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:44.204
And we are still getting together
- the ones who have survived -

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:47.557
because many of us passed away,
and others are ill.

00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:53.566
We have different ideologies now,

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:57.066
a different culture or religion,

00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:59.167
but there is still something
that unites us,

00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:03.574
that common thread of pain,
that fight that never ends,

00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:07.363
because I believe not a day goes by

00:02:07.364 --> 00:02:09.755
that a mother doesn't love
her sons or daughters,

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:13.498
especially if she has been searching
for her beloved son.

00:02:16.144 --> 00:02:19.298
So we started by
getting together and searching

00:02:20.378 --> 00:02:22.462
not knowing exactly where or how to do it.

00:02:22.463 --> 00:02:26.087
We started searching for the babies
at first, but we got no answers.

00:02:26.088 --> 00:02:28.082
They were never brought back to us.

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:31.576
We prepared our homes and the layettes,

00:02:33.577 --> 00:02:36.970
but we soon left our families uncared for,

00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:39.944
we swept our traditional gender roles

00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:44.600
as mothers, as wives,
in my case my job as a teacher too,

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:48.998
and let our husbands
take care of the home;

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:52.924
that's what we tell people who asked us
how were the grandfathers involved.

00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:55.883
Well, they were there,
fulfilling domestic duties.

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:59.410
I think of them as anonymous heroes

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:04.047
because they were left to care

00:03:04.048 --> 00:03:08.485
for the children at home,
provide as sole breadwinners,

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:11.543
and wait for us in silence

00:03:11.544 --> 00:03:16.453
because every time we went marching
they never knew if we were to come back.

00:03:17.223 --> 00:03:20.200
I remember one time
I was a little discouraged

00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:24.026
and said that I'd quit
with no apparent reason,

00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:28.026
and my husband intervened and told me
that I couldn't, I had to go on,

00:03:28.027 --> 00:03:30.696
because the Grandmothers needed me.

00:03:30.697 --> 00:03:36.096
It was the only time I felt like quitting,
but never again; on the contrary.

00:03:36.097 --> 00:03:39.060
You know that I found my grandson,

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.036
we were reunited, we're living together!

00:03:41.036 --> 00:03:43.512
(Applause)

00:03:43.512 --> 00:03:45.278
What a moment!

00:03:50.203 --> 00:03:55.026
But I want to let you know, to share
it with you: I didn't find him by myself.

00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:59.670
I've got help from the Grandmothers,
from all of you, all this time

00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:04.983
- the longest period in the history
of democracy here in Argentina -

00:04:04.984 --> 00:04:08.633
because we got together
in a common understanding

00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:12.403
the dictatorship's affected all of us,
and we must ensure it doesn't happen again

00:04:12.403 --> 00:04:16.099
and that we must find and get back
our kidnapped Disappeared alive.

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.672
So my grandson is everybody's grandson.

00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:21.545
See, something amazing happened:

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:27.679
there is a permanent smile on people's
faces in the country since that encounter.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.726
It may be because of this woman's fight
for 37 years, out of love,

00:04:34.724 --> 00:04:39.833
overcoming hatred and resentment,
hoping this doesn't happen again,

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:43.720
that our children will live
to be free, to be freethinkers,

00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:46.741
and to learn how to disagree
but live together as brothers.

00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:50.905
That's why I think
this multitudinous, wonderful event

00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:55.359
we're attending in this cultural space

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.674
should foster coexistence
beyond differences.

00:05:01.365 --> 00:05:05.097
The Grandmothers,
even today argue on things,

00:05:05.098 --> 00:05:07.750
we have diverging views we don't agree on,

00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:10.974
but when we have to come to a decision
we are resolving it together.

00:05:10.975 --> 00:05:13.092
We know we are lucky,

00:05:13.093 --> 00:05:18.150
but I sometimes say is funny
how one gets to thank life through pain.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:22.784
For my daughter gave her life
knowing that things should change,

00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:24.808
and they are,

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:29.176
but there are many roads left unexplored.

00:05:29.177 --> 00:05:31.156
One of them is science.

00:05:31.157 --> 00:05:35.256
There is no other genetic Data Bank
anywhere in the whole world but here

00:05:35.257 --> 00:05:40.251
where grandparents can search
for their kidnapped grandchildren.

00:05:40.252 --> 00:05:44.939
We are the only country with a history

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.497
in the search
of stolen babies, now adults.

00:05:49.498 --> 00:05:52.817
But what a joyous moment
when we are reunited!

00:05:52.818 --> 00:05:57.291
The happiness!
I feel younger, I feel better.

00:05:57.292 --> 00:06:02.490
Sometimes I feel like throwing this cane,
but I have to tell you that is a symbol

00:06:02.491 --> 00:06:06.018
of all the Grandmothers,
because we never kneel down,

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:11.489
we are always marching head-high,
resolutely, determined and with dignity.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.202
Because there is no need for violence
in order to have justice done.

00:06:16.203 --> 00:06:18.636
Justice is being done.

00:06:20.084 --> 00:06:22.716
And I think we made a small contribution

00:06:22.717 --> 00:06:27.685
to our current democracy
that we hope it will last forever.

00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:32.234
(Applause)

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.570
In this brief talk
I wish you all the best.

00:06:45.573 --> 00:06:50.687
If you are here, then I think
it's because you are those Argentineans

00:06:50.688 --> 00:06:56.020
who deserve respect, to be heard,

00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:59.918
and have their demands satisfied.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:06.303
The most important thing
is not to be alone, not to give up.

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:09.553
Because perseverance
is the key of all triumphs.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:15.541
37 years later I am here,

00:07:15.542 --> 00:07:18.798
and I thank you today
for helping me find my grandson;

00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:22.905
it's something worth fighting for.

00:07:22.906 --> 00:07:25.580
Thank you very much.

00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:28.226
(Applause)
