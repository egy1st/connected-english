WEBVTT

00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:02.816
I am multidisciplinary.

00:00:02.816 --> 00:00:07.799
As a scientist, I've been a crew commander
for a NASA Mars simulation last year,

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.718
and as an artist, I create multicultural
community art all over the planet.

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:17.622
And recently, I've actually
been combining both.

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:20.627
But let me first talk a little more
about that NASA mission.

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:23.240
This is the HI-SEAS program.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.936
HI-SEAS is a NASA-funded
planetary surface analogue

00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:29.664
on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii,

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:32.690
and it's a research program
that is specifically designed

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.713
to study the effects
of long-term isolation of small crews.

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:41.601
I lived in this dome for four months
with a crew of six,

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.386
a very interesting experience, of course.

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:46.369
We did all kinds of research.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.821
Our main research
was actually a food study,

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:51.700
but apart from that food study --

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.488
developing a new food system
for astronauts living in deep space --

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.621
we also did all kinds of other research.

00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:00.942
We did extra-vehicular activities,
as you can see here,

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:02.986
wearing mock-up space suits,

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:05.655
but we also had our chores
and lots of other stuff to do,

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:07.907
like questionnaires
at the end of every day.

00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:09.700
Busy, busy work.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.752
Now, as you can imagine,

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:14.804
it's quite challenging to live
with just a small group of people

00:01:14.804 --> 00:01:16.987
in a small space for a long time.

00:01:16.987 --> 00:01:19.216
There's all kinds
of psychological challenges:

00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:23.092
how to keep a team together
in these circumstances;

00:01:23.092 --> 00:01:25.822
how to deal with the warping of time
you start to sense

00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:28.015
when you're living in these circumstances;

00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:29.949
sleep problems that arise; etc.

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:32.033
But also we learned a lot.

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.749
I learned a lot about
how individual crew members

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.419
actually cope with a situation like this;

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:40.926
how you can keep a crew
productive and happy,

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:43.526
for example, giving them
a good deal of autonomy

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:45.058
is a good trick to do that;

00:01:45.058 --> 00:01:48.047
and honestly, I learned
a lot about leadership,

00:01:48.047 --> 00:01:49.935
because I was a crew commander.

00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:51.839
So doing this mission,

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:56.725
I really started thinking more deeply
about our future in outer space.

00:01:56.725 --> 00:02:00.394
We will venture into outer space,
and we will start inhabiting outer space.

00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:02.159
I have no doubt about it.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.744
It might take 50 years
or it might take 500 years,

00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:08.443
but it's going to happen nevertheless.

00:02:08.443 --> 00:02:12.434
So I came up with
a new art project called Seeker.

00:02:12.434 --> 00:02:16.355
And the Seeker project is actually
challenging communities all over the world

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:19.209
to come up with starship prototypes

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.513
that re-envision
human habitation and survival.

00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:24.382
That's the core of the project.

00:02:24.382 --> 00:02:26.739
Now, one important thing:

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.244
This is not a dystopian project.

00:02:29.244 --> 00:02:31.956
This is not about, "Oh my God,
the world is going wrong

00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:35.218
and we have to escape because we need
another future somewhere else."

00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:36.499
No, no.

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:39.696
The project is basically inviting people

00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:42.661
to take a step away
from earthbound constraints

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:45.319
and, as such, reimagine our future.

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.003
And it's really helpful,
and it works really well,

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:52.260
so that's really the important part
of what we're doing.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.988
Now, in this project,
I'm using a cocreation approach,

00:02:56.988 --> 00:02:59.078
which is a slightly different approach

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.580
from what you would expect
from many artists.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.962
I'm essentially dropping a basic idea
into a group, into a community,

00:03:05.963 --> 00:03:08.491
people start gravitating to the idea,

00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:11.851
and together, we shape 
and build the artwork.

00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:14.018
It's a little bit like termites, really.

00:03:14.018 --> 00:03:15.308
We just work together,

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:18.264
and even, for example,
when architects visit what we're doing,

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:20.849
sometimes they have a bit
of a hard time understanding

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.527
how we build without a master plan.

00:03:22.527 --> 00:03:25.986
We always come up with these
fantastic large-scale scupltures

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:28.528
that actually we can also inhabit.

00:03:29.678 --> 00:03:33.022
The first version was done
in Belgium and Holland.

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:35.924
It was built with a team
of almost 50 people.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.785
This is the second iteration
of that same project,

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:40.745
but in Slovenia, in a different country,

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:44.987
and the new group was like, we're going 
to do the architecture differently.

00:03:44.987 --> 00:03:48.291
So they took away the architecture,
they kept the base of the artwork,

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:50.343
and they built an entirely new,

00:03:50.343 --> 00:03:53.014
much more biomorphic
architecture on top of that.

00:03:53.014 --> 00:03:55.429
And that's another
crucial part of the project.

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:59.310
It's an evolving artwork,
evolving architecture.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.137
This was the last version that was just
presented a few weeks ago in Holland,

00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:07.282
which was using caravans 
as modules to build a starship.

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:09.308
We bought some second-hand caravans,

00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:10.605
cut them open,

00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:13.342
and reassembled them into a starship.

00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:16.249
Now, when we're thinking about starships,

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:19.287
we're not just approaching it
as a technological challenge.

00:04:19.287 --> 00:04:22.215
We're really looking at it
as a combination of three systems:

00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:24.596
ecology, people and technology.

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:28.154
So there's always a strong ecological
component in the project.

00:04:28.154 --> 00:04:30.523
Here you can see aquaponic systems

00:04:30.523 --> 00:04:32.727
that are actually
surrounding the astronauts,

00:04:32.727 --> 00:04:38.219
so they're constantly in contact
with part of the food that they're eating.

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.695
Now, a very typical thing for this project

00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:48.773
is that we run our own isolation missions
inside these art and design projects.

00:04:48.773 --> 00:04:51.747
We actually lock ourselves up
for multiple days on end,

00:04:51.747 --> 00:04:53.447
and test what we build.

00:04:53.447 --> 00:04:54.875
And this is, for example,

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:57.489
on the right hand side
you can see an isolation mission

00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:00.407
in the Museum of Modern Art
in Ljubljana in Slovenia,

00:05:00.407 --> 00:05:03.025
where six artists and designers
locked themselves up --

00:05:03.025 --> 00:05:04.935
I was part of that --

00:05:04.935 --> 00:05:07.173
for four days inside the museum.

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.928
And, of course, obviously,
this is a very performative

00:05:09.928 --> 00:05:14.130
and very strong experience for all of us.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.549
Now, the next version of the project
is currently being developed

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:22.512
together with Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran,
who is also a TED Fellow,

00:05:22.512 --> 00:05:26.788
in the Atacama Desert in Chile,
a magical place.

00:05:26.788 --> 00:05:29.896
First of all, it's really
considered a Mars analogue.

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:32.590
It really does look like Mars
in certain locations

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.119
and has been used by NASA
to test equipment.

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:39.222
And it has a long history
of being connected to space

00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:41.977
through observations of the stars.

00:05:41.977 --> 00:05:43.645
It's now home to ALMA,

00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:46.423
the large telescope
that's being developed there.

00:05:47.183 --> 00:05:51.143
But also, it's the driest
location on the planet,

00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:54.144
and that makes it extremely interesting
to build our project,

00:05:54.144 --> 00:05:59.829
because suddenly, sustainability
is something we have to explore fully.

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:01.661
We have no other option,

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:04.074
so I'm very curious to see
what's going to happen.

00:06:04.074 --> 00:06:08.231
Now, a specific thing for this
particular version of the project

00:06:08.231 --> 00:06:10.413
is that I'm very interested to see

00:06:10.413 --> 00:06:12.569
how we can connect
with the local population,

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:13.802
the native population.

00:06:13.802 --> 00:06:16.544
These people have been living there
for a very long time

00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:19.516
and can be considered
experts in sustainability,

00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:22.487
and so I'm very interested
to see what we can learn from them,

00:06:22.487 --> 00:06:25.819
and have an input of indigenous knowledge
into space exploration.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:31.598
So we're trying to redefine
how we look at our future in outer space

00:06:31.598 --> 00:06:36.002
by exploring integration,
biology, technology and people;

00:06:36.002 --> 00:06:38.652
by using a cocreation approach;

00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:42.099
and by using and exploring
local traditions

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:46.528
and to see how we can learn from the past
and integrate that into our deep future.

00:06:46.528 --> 00:06:48.321
Thank you.

00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:50.945
(Applause)
