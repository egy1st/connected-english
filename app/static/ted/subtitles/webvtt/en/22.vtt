WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.532
I'm Michael Shermer,
director of the Skeptics Society,

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:04.088
publisher of "Skeptic" magazine.

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:06.025
We investigate claims of the paranormal,

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.731
pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults,
and claims of all kinds between,

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:12.649
science and pseudo-science
and non-science and junk science,

00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:15.976
voodoo science, pathological science,
bad science, non-science,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.887
and plain old non-sense.

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:19.828
And unless you've been on Mars recently,

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.870
you know there's a lot of that out there.

00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:24.916
Some people call us debunkers,
which is kind of a negative term.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.048
But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:30.525
We are like the bunko squads
of the police departments out there --

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:33.976
well, we're sort of like
the Ralph Naders of bad ideas,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.230
(Laughter)

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:37.976
trying to replace bad ideas
with good ideas.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.863
I'll show you an example of a bad idea.

00:00:39.887 --> 00:00:41.045
I brought this with me,

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:44.976
this was given to us
by NBC Dateline to test.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.286
It's produced by the Quadro
Corporation of West Virginia.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.220
It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.

00:00:51.244 --> 00:00:52.690
(Laughter)

00:00:52.714 --> 00:00:57.976
This was being sold to high-school
administrators for $900 apiece.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.327
It's a piece of plastic with a Radio
Shack antenna attached to it.

00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:04.317
You could dowse for all sorts of things,

00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:07.734
but this particular one was built
to dowse for marijuana

00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:08.976
in students' lockers.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.460
(Laughter)

00:01:11.484 --> 00:01:15.029
So the way it works
is you go down the hallway,

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:18.052
and you see if it tilts
toward a particular locker,

00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:19.520
and then you open the locker.

00:01:19.544 --> 00:01:21.121
So it looks something like this.

00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:22.328
I'll show you.

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:24.976
(Laughter)

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.391
Well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:31.220
Well, this is science,
so we'll do a controlled experiment.

00:01:31.244 --> 00:01:32.826
It'll go this way for sure.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.784
(Laughter)

00:01:36.808 --> 00:01:39.334
Sir, do you want to empty
your pockets, please, sir?

00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:41.196
(Laughter)

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.677
So the question was, can it actually
find marijuana in students' lockers?

00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:47.299
And the answer is,
if you open enough of them, yes.

00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:48.346
(Laughter)

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.976
(Applause)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.381
But in science, we have to keep track
of the misses, not just the hits.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:56.671
And that's probably the key lesson
to my short talk here:

00:01:56.695 --> 00:02:00.429
This is how psychics work, astrologers,
tarot card readers and so on.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.672
People remember the hits
and forget the misses.

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:04.591
In science, we keep the whole database,

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:07.276
and look to see if the number
of hits somehow stands out

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.513
from the total number
you'd expect by chance.

00:02:09.537 --> 00:02:10.831
In this case, we tested it.

00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:12.347
We had two opaque boxes:

00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:16.005
one with government-approved THC
marijuana, and one with nothing.

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.910
And it got it 50 percent of the time --

00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:19.027
(Laughter)

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.976
which is exactly what you'd expect
with a coin-flip model.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.991
So that's just a fun little example
here of the sorts of things we do.

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:29.483
"Skeptic" is the quarterly publication.
Each one has a particular theme.

00:02:29.507 --> 00:02:31.581
This one is on the future of intelligence.

00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:33.376
Are people getting smarter or dumber?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.448
I have an opinion of this myself
because of the business I'm in,

00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:39.139
but in fact, people, it turns out,
are getting smarter.

00:02:39.163 --> 00:02:41.976
Three IQ points per 10 years, going up.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.651
Sort of an interesting thing.

00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:47.222
With science, don't think of skepticism
as a thing, or science as a thing.

00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:48.976
Are science and religion compatible?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.231
It's like, are science
and plumbing compatible?

00:02:51.255 --> 00:02:52.889
They're just two different things.

00:02:52.913 --> 00:02:54.652
Science is not a thing. It's a verb.

00:02:54.676 --> 00:02:56.398
It's a way of thinking about things.

00:02:56.422 --> 00:02:59.492
It's a way of looking for natural
explanations for all phenomena.

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:00.866
I mean, what's more likely:

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.453
that extraterrestrial intelligences
or multi-dimensional beings

00:03:04.477 --> 00:03:06.867
travel across vast distances
of interstellar space

00:03:06.891 --> 00:03:10.071
to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's
field in Puckerbrush, Kansas

00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:11.905
to promote skeptic.com, our web page?

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:16.407
Or is it more likely that a reader
of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?

00:03:16.431 --> 00:03:18.081
And in all cases we have to ask --

00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:19.929
(Laughter)

00:03:19.953 --> 00:03:21.976
What's the more likely explanation?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.167
Before we say something
is out of this world,

00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:26.855
we should first make sure
that it's not in this world.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.030
What's more likely:

00:03:28.054 --> 00:03:31.380
that Arnold had extraterrestrial help
in his run for the governorship,

00:03:31.404 --> 00:03:33.902
or that the "World Weekly News"
makes stuff up?

00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:35.315
(Laughter)

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:40.001
The same theme is expressed nicely
here in this Sidney Harris cartoon.

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:43.240
For those of you in the back,
it says here: "Then a miracle occurs.

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:45.976
I think you need to be more
explicit here in step two."

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.496
This single slide completely dismantles
the intelligent design arguments.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.368
There's nothing more to it than that.

00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:53.442
(Applause)

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:54.854
You can say a miracle occurs,

00:03:54.878 --> 00:03:57.844
it's just that it doesn't explain
anything or offer anything.

00:03:57.868 --> 00:03:59.018
There's nothing to test.

00:03:59.042 --> 00:04:02.490
It's the end of the conversation
for intelligent design creationists.

00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:07.400
And it's true, scientists sometimes throw
terms out as linguistic place fillers --

00:04:07.424 --> 00:04:09.772
dark energy or dark matter,
something like that --

00:04:09.796 --> 00:04:12.256
until we figure out what it is,
we'll call it this.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.981
It's the beginning of the causal
chain for science.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:19.080
For intelligent design creationists,
it's the end of the chain.

00:04:19.104 --> 00:04:21.276
So again, we can ask this:
what's more likely?

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.691
Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual
cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?

00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:28.976
This is a UFO shot from my house
in Altadena, California,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.976
looking down over Pasadena.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.521
And if it looks a lot like a Buick
hubcap, it's because it is.

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:37.283
You don't even need Photoshop
or high-tech equipment,

00:04:37.307 --> 00:04:38.505
you don't need computers.

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.976
This was shot with a throwaway
Kodak Instamatic camera.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.096
You just have somebody off on the side
with a hubcap ready to go.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.018
Camera's ready -- that's it.

00:04:47.042 --> 00:04:48.479
(Laughter)

00:04:48.503 --> 00:04:51.976
So, although it's possible
that most of these things are fake

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.714
or illusions or so on,
and that some of them are real,

00:04:55.738 --> 00:04:58.871
it's more likely that all of them
are fake, like the crop circles.

00:04:58.895 --> 00:05:02.276
On a more serious note, in all of science
we're looking for a balance

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.976
between data and theory.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.976
In the case of Galileo,
he had two problems

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.361
when he turned his telescope to Saturn.

00:05:10.385 --> 00:05:13.507
First of all, there was no
theory of planetary rings.

00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:15.724
Second of all, his data
was grainy and fuzzy,

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:18.276
and he couldn't quite make out
what he was looking at.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.976
So he wrote that he had seen --

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.507
"I have observed that the furthest
planet has three bodies."

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:26.396
And this is what he ended up
concluding that he saw.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.976
So without a theory of planetary
rings and with only grainy data,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.918
you can't have a good theory.

00:05:31.942 --> 00:05:33.561
It wasn't solved until 1655.

00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:36.599
This is Christiaan Huygens's book
that catalogs all the mistakes

00:05:36.623 --> 00:05:39.585
people made trying to figure out
what was going on with Saturn.

00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:41.465
It wasn't till Huygens had two things:

00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:45.975
He had a good theory of planetary rings
and how the solar system operated,

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.862
and he had better telescopic,
more fine-grain data

00:05:48.886 --> 00:05:52.429
in which he could figure out that
as the Earth is going around faster --

00:05:52.453 --> 00:05:55.681
according to Kepler's Laws --
than Saturn, then we catch up with it.

00:05:55.705 --> 00:05:58.976
And we see the angles of the rings
at different angles, there.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.220
And that, in fact, turns out to be true.

00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:06.541
The problem with having a theory is that
it may be loaded with cognitive biases.

00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:09.832
So one of the problems of explaining
why people believe weird things

00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:11.924
is that we have things, on a simple level,

00:06:11.948 --> 00:06:13.776
and then I'll go to more serious ones.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.676
Like, we have a tendency to see faces.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.476
This is the face on Mars.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.012
In 1976, where there was a whole movement
to get NASA to photograph that area

00:06:22.036 --> 00:06:25.952
because people thought this was monumental
architecture made by Martians.

00:06:25.976 --> 00:06:28.747
Here's the close-up of it from 2001.

00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:31.231
If you squint, you can still see the face.

00:06:31.255 --> 00:06:32.557
And when you're squinting,

00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:35.604
you're turning that from fine-grain
to coarse-grain,

00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:37.915
so you're reducing
the quality of your data.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.168
And if I didn't tell you what to look for,
you'd still see the face,

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.621
because we're programmed
by evolution to see faces.

00:06:43.645 --> 00:06:45.796
Faces are important for us socially.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.288
And of course, happy faces,
faces of all kinds are easy to see.

00:06:49.312 --> 00:06:51.208
You see the happy face on Mars, there.

00:06:51.232 --> 00:06:52.383
(Laughter)

00:06:52.407 --> 00:06:55.320
If astronomers were frogs,
perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.

00:06:55.344 --> 00:06:57.297
Do you see him there? Little froggy legs.

00:06:57.688 --> 00:06:59.883
Or if geologists were elephants?

00:07:00.736 --> 00:07:03.976
Religious iconography.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.801
(Laughter)

00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:08.976
Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.477
He charged five bucks a head
to come see the nun bun

00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:15.214
till he got a cease-and-desist
from Mother Teresa's lawyer.

00:07:15.238 --> 00:07:18.976
Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our
Lady of Watsonville, just down the street,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.604
or is it up the street from here?

00:07:20.628 --> 00:07:23.976
Tree bark is particularly good
because it's nice and grainy, branchy,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
black-and-white splotchy and you can
get the pattern-seeking --

00:07:27.024 --> 00:07:28.976
humans are pattern-seeking animals.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.563
Here's the Virgin Mary on the side
of a glass window in Sao Paulo.

00:07:32.587 --> 00:07:36.001
Here's when the Virgin Mary made
her appearance on a cheese sandwich --

00:07:36.025 --> 00:07:38.515
which I got to actually
hold in a Las Vegas casino --

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:40.076
of course, this being America.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.625
(Laughter)

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:45.976
This casino paid $28,500
on eBay for the cheese sandwich.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.976
(Laughter)

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.381
But who does it really look like?
The Virgin Mary?

00:07:50.405 --> 00:07:52.384
(Laughter)

00:07:52.408 --> 00:07:56.273
It has that sort of
puckered lips, 1940s-era look.

00:07:56.297 --> 00:07:57.976
Virgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.976
I actually went to see this one.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.834
There was a lot of people there.

00:08:01.858 --> 00:08:06.510
The faithful come in their wheelchairs
and crutches, and so on.

00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:08.395
We went down and investigated.

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:11.592
Just to give you a size, that's Dawkins,
me and The Amazing Randi,

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:14.029
next to this two,
two and a half story-sized image.

00:08:14.053 --> 00:08:17.555
All these candles, thousands of candles
people had lit in tribute to this.

00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:20.384
So we walked around the backside,
to see what was going on.

00:08:20.408 --> 00:08:23.739
It turns out wherever there's
a sprinkler head and a palm tree,

00:08:23.763 --> 00:08:24.976
you get the effect.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.381
Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside,
which they started to wipe off.

00:08:28.405 --> 00:08:30.976
I guess you can only have
one miracle per building.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.333
(Laughter)

00:08:34.357 --> 00:08:38.036
So is it really a miracle of Mary,
or is it a miracle of Marge?

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.061
(Laughter)

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:42.688
And now I'm going to finish up
with another example of this,

00:08:42.712 --> 00:08:45.489
with auditory illusions.

00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:48.039
There's this film, "White Noise,"
with Michael Keaton,

00:08:48.063 --> 00:08:50.597
about the dead talking back to us.

00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:54.286
By the way, the whole business of talking
to the dead is not that big a deal.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.795
Anybody can do it, turns out.

00:08:55.819 --> 00:08:58.907
It's getting the dead to talk
back that's the really hard part.

00:08:58.931 --> 00:09:00.029
(Laughter)

00:09:00.053 --> 00:09:03.835
In this case, supposedly, these messages
are hidden in electronic phenomena.

00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:07.144
There's a ReverseSpeech.com web page
where I downloaded this stuff.

00:09:07.168 --> 00:09:10.319
This is the most famous one
of all of these.

00:09:10.343 --> 00:09:13.144
Here's the forward version
of the very famous song.

00:09:13.168 --> 00:09:14.239
(Music with lyrics)

00:09:14.263 --> 00:09:19.421
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
don't be alarmed now.

00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:23.884
It's just a spring clean
for the May Queen.

00:09:25.764 --> 00:09:30.751
Yes, there are two paths you
can go by, but in the long run,

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.434
There's still time to change
the road you're on.

00:09:36.514 --> 00:09:38.094
(Music ends)

00:09:38.733 --> 00:09:41.344
Couldn't you just listen to that all day?

00:09:41.368 --> 00:09:42.975
All right, here it is backwards,

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:47.029
and see if you can hear the hidden
messages that are supposedly in there.

00:09:47.513 --> 00:09:54.291
(Music with unintelligible lyrics)

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.744
(Lyrics) Satan!

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:09.245
(Unintelligible lyrics continue)

00:10:16.934 --> 00:10:18.554
What did you get?
Audience: Satan!

00:10:18.578 --> 00:10:20.290
Satan. OK, at least we got "Satan".

00:10:20.314 --> 00:10:22.616
Now, I'll prime the auditory
part of your brain

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.077
to tell you what you're supposed
to hear, and then hear it again.

00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:29.902
(Music with lyrics)

00:10:52.673 --> 00:10:53.759
(Music ends)

00:10:53.783 --> 00:10:54.990
(Laughter)

00:10:55.014 --> 00:11:01.403
(Applause)

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:03.976
You can't miss it
when I tell you what's there.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.250
(Laughter)

00:11:07.274 --> 00:11:11.309
I'm going to just end
with a positive, nice little story.

00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:14.178
The Skeptics is a nonprofit
educational organization.

00:11:14.202 --> 00:11:17.022
We're always looking for little
good things that people do.

00:11:17.046 --> 00:11:19.055
And in England, there's a pop singer.

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:22.824
One of the top popular singers
in England today, Katie Melua.

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:24.376
And she wrote a beautiful song.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.976
It was in the top five in 2005, called,
"Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.096
It's a love story -- she's sort
of the Norah Jones of the UK --

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.741
about how she much loves her guy,

00:11:34.765 --> 00:11:37.241
and compared to nine million
bicycles, and so forth.

00:11:37.265 --> 00:11:39.490
And she has this one passage here.

00:11:39.514 --> 00:11:40.550
(Music)

00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:46.345
(Lyrics) We are 12 billion
light-years from the edge

00:11:46.369 --> 00:11:48.694
That's a guess,

00:11:48.718 --> 00:11:52.429
No one can ever say it's true,

00:11:52.453 --> 00:11:57.056
But I know that I will always be with you.

00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:00.696
Michael Shermer: Well, that's nice.
At least she got it close.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.643
In America it'd be,
"We're 6,000 light years from the edge."

00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:04.703
(Laughter)

00:12:04.727 --> 00:12:08.496
But my friend, Simon Singh, the particle
physicist now turned science educator,

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.647
who wrote the book
"The Big Bang," and so on,

00:12:10.671 --> 00:12:13.076
uses every chance he gets
to promote good science.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.386
And so he wrote an op-ed piece
in "The Guardian" about Katie's song,

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:21.446
in which he said, well, we know exactly
how far from the edge.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.288
You know, it's 13.7 billion light years,
and it's not a guess.

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:29.576
We know within precise
error bars how close it is.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.410
So we can say, although not absolutely
true, it's pretty close to being true.

00:12:33.434 --> 00:12:38.173
And, to his credit, Katie called him up
after this op-ed piece came out, and said,

00:12:38.197 --> 00:12:40.568
"I'm so embarrassed.
I was in the astronomy club.

00:12:40.592 --> 00:12:41.870
I should've known better."

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:43.116
And she re-cut the song.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.988
So I will end with the new version.

00:12:45.012 --> 00:12:46.276
(Music with lyrics)

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.721
We are 13.7 billion light years

00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:52.236
from the edge of the observable universe.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.029
That's a good estimate
with well-defined error bars.

00:12:56.053 --> 00:12:59.205
And with the available information,

00:12:59.229 --> 00:13:03.572
I predict that I will always be with you.

00:13:03.596 --> 00:13:04.753
(Laughter)

00:13:04.777 --> 00:13:05.945
How cool is that?

00:13:05.969 --> 00:13:08.000
(Applause)
