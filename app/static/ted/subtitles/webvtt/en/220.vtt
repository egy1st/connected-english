00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.976
My name is Joseph,
a Member of Parliament in Kenya.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.975
Picture a Maasai village,

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:06.166
and one evening,

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:08.975
government soldiers come,
surround the village

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.191
and ask each elder to bring
one boy to school.

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:12.976
That's how I went to school --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
pretty much a government guy
pointing a gun

00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:17.263
and told my father,
"You have to make a choice."

00:00:17.287 --> 00:00:19.976
I walked very comfortably
to this missionary school,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.976
that was run by an American missionary.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.976
The first thing the American missionary
gave me was a candy.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.976
I had never in my life ever tasted candy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.620
So I said to myself,
with all these hundred other boys,

00:00:29.644 --> 00:00:31.005
this is where I belong.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.831
(Laughter) I stayed.

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:34.976
When everybody else was dropping out.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.720
My family moved; we're nomads.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.697
It was a boarding school, I was seven --

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:41.410
Every time it closed
you had to travel to find them.

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:42.976
40-50 miles, it doesn't matter.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You slept in the bush, but you kept going.

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.976
And I stayed. I don't know why, but I did.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.976
All of a sudden I passed
the national examination,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.976
found myself in a very beautiful
high school in Kenya.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.752
And I finished high school.

00:00:56.908 --> 00:00:58.725
And just walking, I found a man

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.349
who gave me a full scholarship
to the United States.

00:01:01.617 --> 00:01:03.634
My mother still lived in a cow-dung hut,

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.681
none of my brothers were going to school,

00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:07.976
and this man told me, "Here, go."

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.035
I got a scholarship

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:11.698
to St. Lawrence University,
Upstate New York;

00:01:11.723 --> 00:01:12.762
finished that.

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:16.925
And after that I went
to Harvard Graduate School;

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.188
finished that.

00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:20.396
Then I worked in DC a little bit:

00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:23.482
I wrote a book for National Geographic
and taught U.S. history.

00:01:23.507 --> 00:01:25.976
And every time, I kept going back home,

00:01:26.157 --> 00:01:27.625
listening to their problems --

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.195
sick people, people
with no water, all this stuff --

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.804
every time I go back to America,

00:01:32.164 --> 00:01:33.615
I kept thinking about them.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.678
Then one day, an elder gave me
a story that went like this:

00:01:37.365 --> 00:01:41.263
long time ago, there was a big war
between tribes.

00:01:41.524 --> 00:01:44.975
This specific tribe was really afraid
of this other Luhya tribe.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.082
Every time, they sent scouts
to make sure no one attacked them.

00:01:48.564 --> 00:01:51.527
So one day, the scouts came running
and told the villagers,

00:01:51.552 --> 00:01:54.695
"The enemies are coming.
Only half an hour away, they'll be here."

00:01:54.753 --> 00:01:58.233
So people scrambled, took their things
and ready to go, move out.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.305
But there were two men:

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.798
one man was blind, one man had no legs

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.126
-- he was born like that.

00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:08.048
The leader of the chiefs said, "No, sorry.
We can't take you. You'll slow us down.

00:02:08.072 --> 00:02:11.562
We have to flee our women
and children, we have to run."

00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:14.708
And they were left behind, waiting to die.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.975
But these two people worked something out.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.143
The blind man said, "Look,
I'm a very strong man but I can't see."

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:24.453
The man with no legs says,
"I can see as far as the end of the world,

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:28.976
but I can't save myself
from a cat, or whatever animals."

00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:32.976
The blind man went down
on his knees like this,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.048
and told the man with no legs
to go over his back, and stood up.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.976
The man on top can see,
the blind man can walk.

00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:42.647
These guys took off, followed
the footsteps of the villagers

00:02:42.672 --> 00:02:44.738
until they found and passed them.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.976
So, this was told to me
in a setup of elders.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.695
And it's a really poor area.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.174
I represent Northern Kenya:

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:56.753
the most nomadic, remote areas
you can even find.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.976
And that man told me, "So, here you are.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.492
You've got a good education from America,
you have a good life in America;

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:05.763
what are you going to do for us?

00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:09.976
We want you to be our eyes,
we'll give you the legs.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.976
We'll walk you, you lead us."

00:03:12.412 --> 00:03:15.021
The opportunity came.
I was always thinking about that:

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:16.976
"What can I do to help my people?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.346
Every time you go to an area
where for 43 years of independence,

00:03:20.371 --> 00:03:22.912
we still don't have
basic health facilities.

00:03:22.937 --> 00:03:26.063
A man has to be transported
in a wheelbarrow 30 km for a hospital.

00:03:26.088 --> 00:03:27.373
No clean drinking water.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.975
So I said, "I'm going to dedicate myself.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.246
I'm leaving America.

00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.079
I'm going to run for office."

00:03:33.404 --> 00:03:36.627
Last June, I moved from America,

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.065
ran in July election and won.

00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:43.437
And I came for them,

00:03:44.127 --> 00:03:45.253
and that's my goal.

00:03:45.278 --> 00:03:47.710
Right now I have in place,
for the last nine months,

00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:51.580
a plan that in five years,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.973
every nomad will have
clean drinking water.

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:58.420
We're building dispensaries
across that constituency.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.719
I'm asking my friends from America to help

00:04:01.744 --> 00:04:03.976
with bringing nurses
or doctors to help us out.

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:06.335
I'm trying to improve infrastructure.

00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:09.651
I'm using the knowledge
I received from the United States

00:04:09.676 --> 00:04:10.722
and from my community

00:04:11.328 --> 00:04:12.728
to move them forward.

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:16.210
I'm trying to develop
homegrown solutions to our issues

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:18.800
because people from outside
can come and help us,

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:21.418
but if we don't help ourselves,
there's nothing to do.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.015
My plan right now

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.974
as I continue with introducing
students to different fields --

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.849
some become doctors, some lawyers --

00:04:28.874 --> 00:04:31.269
we want to produce
a comprehensive group of people,

00:04:31.294 --> 00:04:34.149
students who can come back
and help us see a community grow

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:37.482
that is in the middle
of a huge economic recession.

00:04:37.817 --> 00:04:40.609
As I continue to be
a Member of Parliament

00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:44.000
and as I continue listening
to all of you talking about botany,

00:04:44.024 --> 00:04:47.000
health, democracy, new inventions,

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.976
I'm hoping that one day
in my own little community --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.976
which is 26,000 square km,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.867
maybe five times Rhode Island --

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:55.161
with no roads,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.579
we'll be able to become a model
to help others develop.

00:04:59.603 --> 00:05:00.964
Thank you very much.

00:05:00.988 --> 00:05:01.988
(Applause)
