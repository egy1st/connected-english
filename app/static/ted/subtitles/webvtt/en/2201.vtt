00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:05.069
We humans have always been very concerned
about the health of our bodies,

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.285
but we haven't always been that good
at figuring out what's important.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.677
Take the ancient Egyptians, for example:

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:15.624
very concerned about the body parts
they thought they'd need in the afterlife,

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:17.714
but they left some parts out.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:20.337
This part, for example.

00:00:20.337 --> 00:00:23.334
Although they very carefully 
preserved the stomach, the lungs,

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:24.499
the liver, and so forth,

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.535
they just mushed up the brain,
drained it out through the nose,

00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:29.259
and threw it away,

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.600
which makes sense, really,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.609
because what does a brain
do for us anyway?

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:36.637
But imagine if there were a kind
of neglected organ in our bodies

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:38.773
that weighed just as much as the brain

00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:41.699
and in some ways was just
as important to who we are,

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.251
but we knew so little about
and treated with such disregard.

00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:48.154
And imagine if,
through new scientific advances,

00:00:48.154 --> 00:00:49.895
we were just beginning to understand

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:52.797
its importance to how
we think of ourselves.

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:55.003
Wouldn't you want to know more about it?

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.229
Well, it turns out that we do
have something just like that:

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:00.641
our gut,

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:03.303
or rather, its microbes.

00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:06.196
But it's not just the microbes
in our gut that are important.

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:07.704
Microbes all over our body

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:10.617
turn out to be really critical
to a whole range of differences

00:01:10.617 --> 00:01:13.114
that make different people who we are.

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:15.428
So for example, have you ever noticed

00:01:15.428 --> 00:01:19.611
how some people get bitten by mosquitos
way more often than others?

00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:24.190
It turns out that everyone's anecdotal
experience out camping is actually true.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.999
For example, I seldom
get bitten by mosquitos,

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:29.276
but my partner Amanda
attracts them in droves,

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:32.339
and the reason why is that we have
different microbes on our skin

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:36.061
that produce different chemicals
that the mosquitos detect.

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.567
Now, microbes are also really important
in the field of medicine.

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:42.032
So, for example, what microbes
you have in your gut

00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:46.494
determine whether particular painkillers
are toxic to your liver.

00:01:46.494 --> 00:01:50.739
They also determine whether or not other
drugs will work for your heart condition.

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:53.426
And, if you're a fruit fly, at least,

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:56.608
your microbes determine
who you want to have sex with.

00:01:56.608 --> 00:01:58.767
We haven't demonstrated this in humans yet

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:03.063
but maybe it's just a matter of time
before we find out. (Laughter)

00:02:03.063 --> 00:02:05.686
So microbes are performing
a huge range of functions.

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:07.452
They help us digest our food.

00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:09.726
They help educate our immune system.

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:11.676
They help us resist disease,

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:14.184
and they may even
be affecting our behavior.

00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:18.131
So what would a map of all these
microbial communities look like?

00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:20.407
Well, it wouldn't look exactly like this,

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:23.286
but it's a helpful guide
for understanding biodiversity.

00:02:23.286 --> 00:02:27.210
Different parts of the world
have different landscapes of organisms

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.781
that are immediately characteristic
of one place or another

00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:33.818
or another.

00:02:33.818 --> 00:02:37.683
With microbiology, it's kind of the same,
although I've got to be honest with you:

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:40.786
All the microbes essentially
look the same under a microscope.

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:43.315
So instead of trying
to identify them visually,

00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:45.801
what we do is we look
at their DNA sequences,

00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:48.725
and in a project called
the Human Microbiome Project,

00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:52.064
NIH funded this $173 million project

00:02:52.064 --> 00:02:54.473
where hundreds 
of researchers came together

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:57.252
to map out all the A's, T's, G's, and C's,

00:02:57.252 --> 00:02:59.428
and all of these microbes
in the human body.

00:02:59.428 --> 00:03:02.789
So when we take them together,
they look like this.

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:06.720
It's a bit more difficult
to tell who lives where now, isn't it?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.268
What my lab does is develop
computational techniques that allow us

00:03:10.268 --> 00:03:12.879
to take all these terabytes
of sequence data

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.892
and turn them into something
that's a bit more useful as a map,

00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:18.645
and so when we do that
with the human microbiome data

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:20.740
from 250 healthy volunteers,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.384
it looks like this.

00:03:23.384 --> 00:03:26.564
Each point here represents
all the complex microbes

00:03:26.564 --> 00:03:28.747
in an entire microbial community.

00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:31.077
See, I told you they basically
all look the same.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:34.966
So what we're looking at is each point
represents one microbial community

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:37.226
from one body site
of one healthy volunteer.

00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:41.022
And so you can see that there's different
parts of the map in different colors,

00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:42.821
almost like separate continents.

00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.279
And what it turns out to be

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.719
is that those, as the different
regions of the body,

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.797
have very different microbes in them.

00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:52.480
So what we have is we have
the oral community up there in green.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.294
Over on the other side,
we have the skin community in blue,

00:03:55.294 --> 00:03:57.581
the vaginal community in purple,

00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:01.282
and then right down at the bottom,
we have the fecal community in brown.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:03.299
And we've just over the last few years

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.098
found out that the microbes
in different parts of the body

00:04:06.098 --> 00:04:08.296
are amazingly different from one another.

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:11.128
So if I look at just one person's microbes

00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:13.242
in the mouth and in the gut,

00:04:13.242 --> 00:04:16.702
it turns out that the difference between
those two microbial communities

00:04:16.702 --> 00:04:18.233
is enormous.

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:21.398
It's bigger than the difference
between the microbes in this reef

00:04:21.398 --> 00:04:24.131
and the microbes in this prairie.

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.662
So this is incredible
when you think about it.

00:04:26.662 --> 00:04:30.028
What it means is that a few feet
of difference in the human body

00:04:30.028 --> 00:04:32.722
makes more of a difference
to your microbial ecology

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:34.967
than hundreds of miles on Earth.

00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:37.987
And this is not to say that two people 
look basically the same

00:04:37.987 --> 00:04:39.839
in the same body habitat, either.

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.445
So you probably heard

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:44.453
that we're pretty much all the same
in terms of our human DNA.

00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:48.542
You're 99.99 percent identical
in terms of your human DNA

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:50.409
to the person sitting next to you.

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.651
But that's not true of your gut microbes:

00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:55.138
you might only share 10 percent similarity

00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:58.648
with the person sitting next to you
in terms of your gut microbes.

00:04:58.648 --> 00:05:01.444
So that's as different
as the bacteria on this prairie

00:05:01.444 --> 00:05:03.500
and the bacteria in this forest.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.909
So these different microbes

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.076
have all these different kinds 
of functions that I told you about,

00:05:09.076 --> 00:05:10.772
everything from digesting food

00:05:10.772 --> 00:05:13.327
to involvement
in different kinds of diseases,

00:05:13.327 --> 00:05:15.193
metabolizing drugs, and so forth.

00:05:15.193 --> 00:05:17.299
So how do they do all this stuff?

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:19.195
Well, in part it's because

00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:22.525
although there's just three pounds
of those microbes in our gut,

00:05:22.525 --> 00:05:24.285
they really outnumber us.

00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:26.505
And so how much do they outnumber us?

00:05:26.505 --> 00:05:29.617
Well, it depends on what
you think of as our bodies.

00:05:29.617 --> 00:05:31.102
Is it our cells?

00:05:31.102 --> 00:05:34.515
Well, each of us consists
of about 10 trillion human cells,

00:05:34.515 --> 00:05:37.746
but we harbor as many
as 100 trillion microbial cells.

00:05:37.746 --> 00:05:40.520
So they outnumber us 10 to one.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.431
Now, you might think, well,
we're human because of our DNA,

00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:47.752
but it turns out that each of us has
about 20,000 human genes,

00:05:47.752 --> 00:05:49.708
depending on what you count exactly,

00:05:49.708 --> 00:05:54.200
but as many as two million
to 20 million microbial genes.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.959
So whichever way we look at it,
we're vastly outnumbered

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:59.791
by our microbial symbionts.

00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:03.018
And it turns out that in addition 
to traces of our human DNA,

00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:05.245
we also leave traces
of our microbial DNA

00:06:05.245 --> 00:06:07.025
on everything we touch.

00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:08.817
We showed in a study a few years ago

00:06:08.817 --> 00:06:11.612
that you can actually match
the palm of someone's hand up

00:06:11.612 --> 00:06:13.889
to the computer mouse
that they use routinely

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.186
with up to 95 percent accuracy.

00:06:16.186 --> 00:06:19.042
So this came out in a scientific journal
a few years ago,

00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:21.595
but more importantly,
it was featured on "CSI: Miami,"

00:06:21.595 --> 00:06:23.382
so you really know it's true.

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:24.977
(Laughter)

00:06:24.977 --> 00:06:28.374
So where do our microbes
come from in the first place?

00:06:28.374 --> 00:06:31.021
Well if, as I do, you have dogs or kids,

00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:33.384
you probably have
some dark suspicions about that,

00:06:33.384 --> 00:06:35.363
all of which are true, by the way.

00:06:35.363 --> 00:06:38.121
So just like we can match
you to your computer equipment

00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:39.824
by the microbes you share,

00:06:39.824 --> 00:06:42.032
we can also match you up to your dog.

00:06:42.032 --> 00:06:44.139
But it turns out that in adults,

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.438
microbial communities
are relatively stable,

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:48.572
so even if you live together with someone,

00:06:48.572 --> 00:06:50.970
you'll maintain your separate
microbial identity

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.984
over a period of weeks,
months, even years.

00:06:53.984 --> 00:06:56.875
It turns out that our
first microbial communities

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.025
depend a lot on how we're born.

00:06:59.025 --> 00:07:01.206
So babies that come out
the regular way,

00:07:01.206 --> 00:07:04.266
all of their microbes are basically
like the vaginal community,

00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:06.631
whereas babies that are
delivered by C-section,

00:07:06.631 --> 00:07:09.537
all of their microbes instead
look like skin.

00:07:09.537 --> 00:07:12.574
And this might be associated
with some of the differences

00:07:12.574 --> 00:07:15.362
in health associated with Cesarean birth,

00:07:15.362 --> 00:07:18.578
such as more asthma, more allergies,
even more obesity,

00:07:18.578 --> 00:07:21.108
all of which have been linked
to microbes now,

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:25.005
and when you think about it,
until recently, every surviving mammal

00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:27.561
had been delivered by the birth canal,

00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:29.837
and so the lack
of those protective microbes

00:07:29.837 --> 00:07:32.287
that we've co-evolved with
might be really important

00:07:32.287 --> 00:07:36.796
for a lot of these different conditions
that we now know involve the microbiome.

00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:39.533
When my own daughter was born
a couple of years ago

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:41.968
by emergency C-section,

00:07:41.968 --> 00:07:43.809
we took matters into our own hands

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:46.489
and made sure she was coated
with those vaginal microbes

00:07:46.489 --> 00:07:48.529
that she would have gotten naturally.

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:51.913
Now, it's really difficult to tell
whether this has had an effect

00:07:51.913 --> 00:07:53.915
on her health specifically, right?

00:07:53.915 --> 00:07:57.596
With a sample size of just one child,
no matter how much we love her,

00:07:57.596 --> 00:07:59.813
you don't really have
enough of a sample size

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.759
to figure out what happens on average,

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:04.656
but at two years old,
she hasn't had an ear infection yet,

00:08:04.656 --> 00:08:06.941
so we're keeping our fingers
crossed on that one.

00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:10.398
And what's more, we're starting
to do clinical trials with more children

00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:13.320
to figure out whether
this has a protective effect generally.

00:08:15.031 --> 00:08:20.354
So how we're born has a tremendous effect
on what microbes we have initially,

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:22.271
but where do we go after that?

00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:24.541
What I'm showing you
again here is this map

00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:26.539
of the Human Microbiome Project Data,

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:29.302
so each point represents
a sample from one body site

00:08:29.302 --> 00:08:31.842
from one of 250 healthy adults.

00:08:31.842 --> 00:08:33.909
And you've seen children
develop physically.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.965
You've seen them develop mentally.

00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:38.040
Now, for the first time,
you're going to see

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.398
one of my colleague's children
develop microbially.

00:08:41.398 --> 00:08:42.963
So what we are going to look at

00:08:42.963 --> 00:08:45.650
is we're going to look 
at this one baby's stool,

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.099
the fecal community,
which represents the gut,

00:08:48.099 --> 00:08:51.268
sampled every week
for almost two and a half years.

00:08:51.268 --> 00:08:52.931
And so we're starting on day one.

00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:56.849
What's going to happen is that the infant
is going to start off as this yellow dot,

00:08:56.849 --> 00:09:00.329
and you can see that he's starting off
basically in the vaginal community,

00:09:00.329 --> 00:09:02.355
as we would expect from his delivery mode.

00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:05.069
And what's going to happen
over these two and a half years

00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:07.211
is that he's going to travel 
all the way down

00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:11.025
to resemble the adult fecal community from
healthy volunteers down at the bottom.

00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:14.373
So I'm just going to start this going
and we'll see how that happens.

00:09:14.913 --> 00:09:18.949
What you can see, and remember
each step in this is just one week,

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:20.815
what you can see is that week to week,

00:09:20.815 --> 00:09:25.498
the change in the microbial community
of the feces of this one child,

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:28.049
the differences week to week
are much greater

00:09:28.049 --> 00:09:30.580
than the differences between
individual healthy adults

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.530
in the Human Microbiome Project cohort,

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.006
which are those brown dots
down at the bottom.

00:09:35.006 --> 00:09:38.203
And you can see he's starting
to approach the adult fecal community.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.718
This is up to about two years.

00:09:39.718 --> 00:09:41.888
But something amazing
is about to happen here.

00:09:41.888 --> 00:09:44.976
So he's getting antibiotics
for an ear infection.

00:09:44.976 --> 00:09:47.530
What you can see is
this huge change in the community,

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.588
followed by a relatively rapid recovery.

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:51.770
I'll just rewind that for you.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.929
And what we can see is that
just over these few weeks,

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:58.862
we have a much more radical change,

00:09:58.862 --> 00:10:01.392
a setback of many months 
of normal development,

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:03.644
followed by a relatively rapid recovery,

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:07.777
and by the time he reaches day 838,

00:10:07.777 --> 00:10:09.496
which is the end of this video,

00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:13.193
you can see that he has essentially
reached the healthy adult stool community,

00:10:13.193 --> 00:10:15.641
despite that antibiotic intervention.

00:10:15.641 --> 00:10:18.969
So this is really interesting
because it raises fundamental questions

00:10:18.969 --> 00:10:23.068
about what happens when we intervene
at different ages in a child's life.

00:10:23.068 --> 00:10:26.679
So does what we do early on, where
the microbiome is changing so rapidly,

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:27.979
actually matter,

00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:30.462
or is it like throwing a stone
into a stormy sea,

00:10:30.462 --> 00:10:32.204
where the ripples will just be lost?

00:10:33.044 --> 00:10:37.335
Well, fascinatingly, it turns out
that if you give children antibiotics

00:10:37.335 --> 00:10:38.985
in the first six months of life,

00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:41.770
they're more likely
to become obese later on

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.897
than if they don't get antibiotics then
or only get them later,

00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:47.843
and so what we do early on
may have profound impacts

00:10:47.843 --> 00:10:51.340
on the gut microbial community
and on later health

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.666
that we're only beginning to understand.

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:57.822
So this is fascinating, because one day,
in addition to the effects

00:10:57.822 --> 00:11:00.468
that antibiotics have
on antibiotic-resistant bacteria,

00:11:00.468 --> 00:11:02.164
which are very important,

00:11:02.164 --> 00:11:05.067
they may also be degrading
our gut microbial ecosystems,

00:11:05.067 --> 00:11:08.339
and so one day we may come
to regard antibiotics with the same horror

00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:10.802
that we currently reserve
for those metal tools

00:11:10.802 --> 00:11:13.261
that the Egyptians used to use
to mush up the brains

00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:15.325
before they drained them out
for embalming.

00:11:15.325 --> 00:11:18.346
So I mentioned that microbes
have all these important functions,

00:11:18.346 --> 00:11:20.995
and they've also now,
just over the past few years,

00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:23.828
been connected to a whole range
of different diseases,

00:11:23.828 --> 00:11:25.913
including inflammatory bowel disease,

00:11:25.913 --> 00:11:27.637
heart disease, colon cancer,

00:11:27.637 --> 00:11:29.467
and even obesity.

00:11:29.467 --> 00:11:32.113
Obesity has a really 
large effect, as it turns out,

00:11:32.113 --> 00:11:34.506
and today, we can tell
whether you're lean or obese

00:11:34.506 --> 00:11:36.385
with 90 percent accuracy

00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:38.497
by looking at the microbes in your gut.

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.786
Now, although that might sound impressive,

00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:44.117
in some ways it's a little bit problematic
as a medical test,

00:11:44.117 --> 00:11:47.114
because you can probably tell
which of these people is obese

00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:49.866
without knowing anything
about their gut microbes,

00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:52.909
but it turns out that even
if we sequence their complete genomes

00:11:52.909 --> 00:11:54.566
and had all their human DNA,

00:11:54.566 --> 00:11:58.932
we could only predict which one
was obese with about 60 percent accuracy.

00:11:58.932 --> 00:12:00.306
So that's amazing, right?

00:12:00.306 --> 00:12:04.118
What it means that the three pounds
of microbes that you carry around with you

00:12:04.118 --> 00:12:06.460
may be more important
for some health conditions

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.125
than every single gene in your genome.

00:12:11.555 --> 00:12:13.792
And then in mice, we can do a lot more.

00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:17.437
So in mice, microbes have been linked
to all kinds of additional conditions,

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:20.153
including things like multiple sclerosis,

00:12:20.153 --> 00:12:23.891
depression, autism, and again, obesity.

00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:26.655
But how can we tell whether
these microbial differences

00:12:26.655 --> 00:12:29.418
that correlate with disease
are cause or effect?

00:12:29.418 --> 00:12:32.065
Well, one thing we can do
is we can raise some mice

00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:34.712
without any microbes of their own
in a germ-free bubble.

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:37.665
Then we can add in some microbes
that we think are important,

00:12:37.665 --> 00:12:39.747
and see what happens.

00:12:39.747 --> 00:12:42.026
When we take the microbes
from an obese mouse

00:12:42.026 --> 00:12:44.530
and transplant them
into a genetically normal mouse

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.389
that's been raised in a bubble
with no microbes of its own,

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:50.742
it becomes fatter than if it got them 
from a regular mouse.

00:12:52.142 --> 00:12:54.461
Why this happens
is absolutely amazing, though.

00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:56.661
Sometimes what's going on
is that the microbes

00:12:56.661 --> 00:12:59.719
are helping them digest food
more efficiently from the same diet,

00:12:59.719 --> 00:13:01.923
so they're taking more energy
from their food,

00:13:01.923 --> 00:13:05.154
but other times, the microbes
are actually affecting their behavior.

00:13:05.154 --> 00:13:08.194
What they're doing is they're eating
more than the normal mouse,

00:13:08.194 --> 00:13:11.364
so they only get fat if we let them 
eat as much as they want.

00:13:12.614 --> 00:13:15.300
So this is really remarkable, right?

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.664
The implication is that microbes
can affect mammalian behavior.

00:13:21.224 --> 00:13:25.382
So you might be wondering whether we can 
also do this sort of thing across species,

00:13:25.382 --> 00:13:28.652
and it turns out that if you take microbes
from an obese person

00:13:28.652 --> 00:13:31.715
and transplant them into mice
you've raised germ-free,

00:13:31.715 --> 00:13:33.805
those mice will also become fatter

00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:36.846
than if they received the microbes
from a lean person,

00:13:36.846 --> 00:13:40.191
but we can design a microbial community
that we inoculate them with

00:13:40.191 --> 00:13:42.745
that prevents them
from gaining this weight.

00:13:43.545 --> 00:13:45.600
We can also do this for malnutrition.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.688
So in a project funded
by the Gates Foundation,

00:13:48.688 --> 00:13:50.871
what we're looking at
is children in Malawi

00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:53.529
who have kwashiorkor,
a profound form of malnutrition,

00:13:53.529 --> 00:13:56.652
and mice that get the kwashiorkor
community transplanted into them

00:13:56.652 --> 00:13:59.022
lose 30 percent of their body mass

00:13:59.022 --> 00:14:00.201
in just three weeks,

00:14:00.201 --> 00:14:04.019
but we can restore their health by using 
the same peanut butter-based supplement

00:14:04.019 --> 00:14:06.132
that is used for 
the children in the clinic,

00:14:06.132 --> 00:14:07.988
and the mice that receive the community

00:14:07.988 --> 00:14:11.235
from the healthy identical twins
of the kwashiorkor children do fine.

00:14:12.035 --> 00:14:15.976
This is truly amazing because it suggests
that we can pilot therapies

00:14:15.976 --> 00:14:18.483
by trying them out
in a whole bunch of different mice

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:20.413
with individual people's gut communities

00:14:20.413 --> 00:14:25.012
and perhaps tailor those therapies
all the way down to the individual level.

00:14:26.262 --> 00:14:29.177
So I think it's really important
that everyone has a chance

00:14:29.177 --> 00:14:31.883
to participate in this discovery.

00:14:31.883 --> 00:14:33.131
So, a couple of years ago,

00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:35.202
we started this project
called American Gut,

00:14:35.202 --> 00:14:39.406
which allows you to claim a place 
for yourself on this microbial map.

00:14:39.406 --> 00:14:42.763
This is now the largest crowd-funded
science project that we know of --

00:14:42.763 --> 00:14:45.651
over 8,000 people
have signed up at this point.

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:48.229
What happens is,
they send in their samples,

00:14:48.229 --> 00:14:52.014
we sequence the DNA of their microbes
and then release the results back to them.

00:14:52.014 --> 00:14:55.705
We also release them, de-identified,
to scientists, to educators,

00:14:55.705 --> 00:14:58.724
to interested members
of the general public, and so forth,

00:14:58.724 --> 00:15:01.879
so anyone can have access to the data.

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:03.050
On the other hand,

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.332
when we do tours of our lab
at the BioFrontiers Institute,

00:15:06.332 --> 00:15:09.892
and we explain that we use robots
and lasers to look at poop,

00:15:09.892 --> 00:15:13.004
it turns out that not
everyone wants to know.

00:15:13.004 --> 00:15:14.286
(Laughter)

00:15:14.286 --> 00:15:16.207
But I'm guessing that many of you do,

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.866
and so I brought some kits here
if you're interested

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:21.596
in trying this out for yourself.

00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:24.993
So why might we want to do this?

00:15:24.993 --> 00:15:27.563
Well, it turns out that microbes
are not just important

00:15:27.563 --> 00:15:30.464
for finding out where we are
in terms of our health,

00:15:30.464 --> 00:15:32.872
but they can actually cure disease.

00:15:32.872 --> 00:15:35.797
This is one of the newest things
we've been able to visualize

00:15:35.797 --> 00:15:38.536
with colleagues 
at the University of Minnesota.

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:41.153
So here's that map
of the human microbiome again.

00:15:41.153 --> 00:15:42.610
What we're looking at now --

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.980
I'm going to add in the community
of some people with C. diff.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.259
So, this is a terrible form of diarrhea

00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:50.604
where you have to go
up to 20 times a day,

00:15:50.604 --> 00:15:53.715
and these people have failed
antibiotic therapy for two years

00:15:53.715 --> 00:15:56.014
before they're eligible for this trial.

00:15:56.014 --> 00:16:00.427
So what would happen if we transplanted
some of the stool from a healthy donor,

00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:02.284
that star down at the bottom,

00:16:02.284 --> 00:16:03.700
into these patients.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.309
Would the good microbes
do battle with the bad microbes

00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:08.388
and help to restore their health?

00:16:08.388 --> 00:16:10.704
So let's watch exactly what happens there.

00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:13.220
Four of those patients
are about to get a transplant

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.124
from that healthy donor at the bottom,

00:16:15.124 --> 00:16:17.081
and what you can see is that immediately,

00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:19.486
you have this radical change
in the gut community.

00:16:19.486 --> 00:16:21.555
So one day after you do that transplant,

00:16:21.555 --> 00:16:23.204
all those symptoms clear up,

00:16:23.204 --> 00:16:24.759
the diarrhea vanishes,

00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:28.531
and they're essentially healthy again,
coming to resemble the donor's community,

00:16:28.531 --> 00:16:30.593
and they stay there.

00:16:30.593 --> 00:16:35.390
(Applause)

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.665
So we're just at the beginning
of this discovery.

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:42.205
We're just finding out that microbes
have implications

00:16:42.205 --> 00:16:44.378
for all these different kinds of diseases,

00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:46.846
ranging from inflammatory 
bowel disease to obesity,

00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:49.929
and perhaps even autism and depression.

00:16:49.929 --> 00:16:51.267
What we need to do, though,

00:16:51.267 --> 00:16:53.525
is we need to develop
a kind of microbial GPS,

00:16:53.525 --> 00:16:55.846
where we don't just know
where we are currently

00:16:55.846 --> 00:16:59.397
but also where we want to go
and what we need to do

00:16:59.397 --> 00:17:00.883
in order to get there,

00:17:00.883 --> 00:17:03.228
and we need to be able
to make this simple enough

00:17:03.228 --> 00:17:05.829
that even a child can use it.
(Laughter)

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.058
Thank you.

00:17:08.058 --> 00:17:11.262
(Applause)
