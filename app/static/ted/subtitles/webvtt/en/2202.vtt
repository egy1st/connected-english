00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.479
As a software developer and technologist,

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:07.126
I've worked on a number
of civic technology projects

00:00:07.126 --> 00:00:08.472
over the years.

00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:12.118
Civic tech is sometimes
referred to as tech for good,

00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:15.763
using technology to solve
humanitarian problems.

00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:17.876
This is in 2010 in Uganda,

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:20.616
working on a solution
that allowed local populations

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:24.099
to avoid government surveillance
on their mobile phones

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.328
for expressing dissent.

00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:29.216
That same technology was deployed
later in North Africa

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:32.998
for similar purposes
to help activists stay connected

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:36.149
when governments were
deliberately shutting off connectivity

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.225
as a means of population control.

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:42.522
But over the years, as I have thought
about these technologies

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:44.523
and the things that I work on,

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:47.542
a question kind of nags
in the back of my mind, which is,

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:50.267
what if we're wrong about
the virtues of technology,

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:52.519
and if it sometimes actively hurts

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.677
the communities
that we're intending to help?

00:00:55.677 --> 00:00:59.456
The tech industry around the world
tends to operate under similar assumptions

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:01.621
that if we build great things,

00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:04.035
it will positively affect everyone.

00:01:04.035 --> 00:01:07.904
Eventually, these innovations
will get out and find everyone.

00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:10.003
But that's not always the case.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:15.784
I like to call this blind championing
of technology "trickle-down techonomics,"

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.129
to borrow a phrase. (Laughter)

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:21.045
We tend to think that if
we design things for the select few,

00:01:21.045 --> 00:01:23.447
eventually those technologies
will reach everyone,

00:01:23.447 --> 00:01:25.002
and that's not always the case.

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:30.018
Technology and innovation
behaves a lot like wealth and capital.

00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:32.897
They tend to consolidate
in the hands of the few,

00:01:32.897 --> 00:01:36.287
and sometimes they find their way out
into the hands of the many.

00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:41.488
And so most of you aren't tackling
oppressive regimes on the weekends,

00:01:41.488 --> 00:01:45.714
so I wanted to think of a few examples
that might be a little bit more relatable.

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:50.066
In the world of wearables
and smartphones and apps,

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:53.329
there's a big movement
to track people's personal health

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.377
with applications that track
the number of calories that you burn

00:01:56.401 --> 00:02:01.220
or whether you're sitting too much
or walking enough.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.561
These technologies make patient intake
in medical facilities much more efficient,

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:11.496
and in turn, these medical facilities

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:14.083
are starting to expect
these types of efficiencies.

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:16.883
As these digital tools
find their way into medical rooms,

00:02:16.883 --> 00:02:18.928
and they become digitally ready,

00:02:18.928 --> 00:02:21.297
what happens to the digitally invisible?

00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:23.297
What does the medical experience look like

00:02:23.321 --> 00:02:26.655
for someone who doesn't have
the $400 phone or watch

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:28.448
tracking their every movement?

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.281
Do they now become a burden
on the medical system?

00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:34.079
Is their experience changed?

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.341
In the world of finance,
Bitcoin and crypto-currencies

00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:40.261
are revolutionizing the way
we move money around the world,

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:42.658
but the challenge with these technologies

00:02:42.658 --> 00:02:45.247
is the barrier to entry
is incredibly high, right?

00:02:45.247 --> 00:02:49.043
You need access to the same
phones, devices, connectivity,

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:52.178
and even where you don't,
where you can find a proxy agent,

00:02:52.178 --> 00:02:57.217
usually they require a certain amount
of capital to participate.

00:02:57.217 --> 00:03:02.000
And so the question that I ask myself
is, what happens to the last community

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.070
using paper notes when the rest
of the world moves to digital currency?

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.055
Another example from my hometown
in Philadelphia:

00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:13.220
I recently went
to the public library there,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.792
and they are facing an existential crisis.

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:17.465
Public funding is dwindling,

00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:22.641
they have to reduce their footprint
to stay open and stay relevant,

00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:25.477
and so one of the ways
they're going about this

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:28.770
is digitizing a number of the books
and moving them to the cloud.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.745
This is great for most kids. Right?

00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:32.598
You can check out books from home,

00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:35.147
you can research on the way
to school or from school,

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:37.339
but these are really two big assumptions,

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:39.336
that one, you have access at home,

00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:41.936
and two, that you have access
to a mobile phone,

00:03:41.936 --> 00:03:44.812
and in Philadelphia, many kids do not.

00:03:44.812 --> 00:03:47.671
So what does their
education experience look like

00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:51.108
in the wake of a completely
cloud-based library,

00:03:51.108 --> 00:03:54.567
what used to be considered
such a basic part of education?

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.556
How do they stay competitive?

00:03:57.566 --> 00:04:01.466
A final example from
across the world in East Africa:

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:06.782
there's been a huge movement
to digitize land ownership rights,

00:04:06.782 --> 00:04:08.383
for a number of reasons.

00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:11.285
Migrant communities,
older generations dying off,

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:13.925
and ultimately poor record-keeping

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:17.392
have led to conflicts over who owns what.

00:04:17.392 --> 00:04:21.664
And so there was a big movement
to put all this information online,

00:04:21.664 --> 00:04:25.424
to track all the ownership
of these plots of land,

00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:28.119
put them in the cloud,
and give them to the communities.

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:31.161
But actually, the unintended
consequence of this

00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:35.531
has been that venture capitalists,
investors, real estate developers,

00:04:35.584 --> 00:04:38.558
have swooped in and they've begun
buying up these plots of land

00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:40.564
right out from under these communities,

00:04:40.564 --> 00:04:42.700
because they have access
to the technologies

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.137
and the connectivity
that makes that possible.

00:04:46.137 --> 00:04:49.287
So that's the common thread
that connects these examples,

00:04:49.287 --> 00:04:52.836
the unintended consequences of the tools
and the technologies that we make.

00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:55.801
As engineers, as technologists,

00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:59.360
we sometimes prefer
efficiency over efficacy.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.753
We think more about doing things
than the outcomes of what we are doing.

00:05:03.753 --> 00:05:05.220
This needs to change.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.251
We have a responsibility to think about
the outcomes of the technologies we build,

00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:12.734
especially as they increasingly
control the world in which we live.

00:05:12.734 --> 00:05:14.174
In the late '90s,

00:05:14.174 --> 00:05:18.283
there was a big push for ethics
in the world of investment and banking.

00:05:18.283 --> 00:05:22.091
I think in 2014, we're long overdue
for a similar movement

00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:25.753
in the area of tech and technology.

00:05:26.573 --> 00:05:30.535
So, I just encourage you, as you are all
thinking about the next big thing,

00:05:30.535 --> 00:05:35.907
as entrepreneurs, as CEOs,
as engineers, as makers,

00:05:35.907 --> 00:05:39.784
that you think about
the unintended consequences

00:05:39.784 --> 00:05:41.944
of the things that you're building,

00:05:41.944 --> 00:05:45.496
because the real innovation
is in finding ways to include everyone.

00:05:45.496 --> 00:05:47.168
Thank you.

00:05:47.168 --> 00:05:51.278
(Applause)
