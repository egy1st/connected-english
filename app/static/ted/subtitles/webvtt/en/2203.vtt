00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.497
(Rainforest noises)

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.167
In the summer of 2011,
as a tourist,

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:17.593
I visited the rainforests of Borneo
for the very first time,

00:00:17.593 --> 00:00:19.641
and as you might imagine,

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:24.911
it was the overwhelming sounds
of the forest that struck me the most.

00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:27.721
There's this constant cacophony of noise.

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.136
Some things actually do stick out.

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:34.562
For example, this here is a big bird,
a rhinoceros hornbill.

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:38.734
This buzzing is a cicada.

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:42.047
This is a family of gibbons.

00:00:42.047 --> 00:00:46.161
It's actually singing to each other
over a great distance.

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:50.334
The place where this was recorded
was in fact a gibbon reserve,

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:52.371
which is why you can hear so many of them,

00:00:52.372 --> 00:00:57.302
but in fact the most important noise that 
was coming out of the forest that time

00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:58.834
was one that I didn't notice,

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:01.943
and in fact nobody there
had actually noticed it.

00:01:02.373 --> 00:01:04.361
So, as I said, this was a gibbon reserve.

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:07.170
They spend most of their time
rehabilitating gibbons,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.731
but they also have
to spend a lot of their time

00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:13.423
protecting their area from illegal logging
that takes place on the side.

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:15.466
And so if we take the sound of the forest

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:19.023
and we actually turn down the gibbons,
the insects, and the rest,

00:01:19.023 --> 00:01:22.689
in the background, the entire time,
in recordings you heard,

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.403
was the sound of a chainsaw
at great distance.

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:30.397
They had three full-time guards
who were posted around this sanctuary

00:01:30.397 --> 00:01:34.599
whose job was in fact
to guard against illegal logging,

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.058
and one day, we went walking,
again as tourists, out into the forest,

00:01:38.058 --> 00:01:40.311
and within five minutes' walk,

00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:43.690
we stumbled upon somebody
who was just sawing a tree down,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.951
five minutes' walk, a few hundred meters
from the ranger station.

00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:49.009
They hadn't been able
to hear the chainsaws,

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.826
because as you heard,
the forest is very, very loud.

00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:56.745
It struck me as quite unacceptable
that in this modern time,

00:01:56.745 --> 00:02:01.217
just a few hundred meters away 
from a ranger station in a sanctuary,

00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:05.022
that in fact nobody could hear it when
someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up.

00:02:05.022 --> 00:02:09.687
It sounds impossible,
but in fact, it was quite true.

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.523
So how do we stop illegal logging?

00:02:11.523 --> 00:02:14.952
It's really tempting, as an engineer,
always to come up with a high-tech,

00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:16.713
super-crazy high-tech solution,

00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:18.663
but in fact, you're in the rainforest.

00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:21.040
It has to be simple,
it has to be scalable,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.048
and so what we also noticed
while were there was that

00:02:24.048 --> 00:02:26.374
everything we needed was already there.

00:02:26.374 --> 00:02:29.125
We could build a system
that would allow us to stop this

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:31.407
using what's already there.

00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:33.639
Who was there? What was 
already in the forest?

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:34.787
Well, we had people.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:38.072
We had this group there that was 
dedicated, three full-time guards,

00:02:38.072 --> 00:02:39.846
that was dedicated to go and stop it,

00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:42.960
but they just needed to know
what was happening out in the forest.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.853
The real surprise, this is the big one,

00:02:44.853 --> 00:02:47.236
was that there was connectivity
out in the forest.

00:02:47.236 --> 00:02:50.150
There was cell phone service
way out in the middle of nowhere.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.081
We're talking hundreds of kilometers
from the nearest road,

00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:56.653
there's certainly no electricity,
but they had very good cell phone service,

00:02:56.653 --> 00:02:59.276
these people in the towns
were on Facebook all the time,

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:01.226
they're surfing the web on their phones,

00:03:01.226 --> 00:03:04.335
and this sort of got me thinking
that in fact it would be possible

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:06.494
to use the sounds of the forest,

00:03:06.494 --> 00:03:08.886
pick up the sounds 
of chainsaws programmatically,

00:03:08.886 --> 00:03:10.534
because people can't hear them,

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:12.221
and send an alert.

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:14.803
But you have to have a device
to go up in the trees.

00:03:14.803 --> 00:03:18.454
So if we can use some device
to listen to the sounds of the forest,

00:03:18.454 --> 00:03:20.687
connect to the cell phone
network that's there,

00:03:20.687 --> 00:03:22.721
and send an alert to people on the ground,

00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:26.271
perhaps we could have a solution
to this issue for them.

00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:29.551
But let's take a moment
to talk about saving the rainforest,

00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:33.393
because it's something that we've
definitely all heard about forever.

00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:36.312
People in my generation
have heard about saving the rainforest

00:03:36.312 --> 00:03:38.212
since we were kids,

00:03:38.212 --> 00:03:40.460
and it seems that the message
has never changed:

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.982
We've got to save the rainforest,
it's super urgent,

00:03:42.982 --> 00:03:45.688
this many football fields
have been destroyed yesterday.

00:03:45.688 --> 00:03:48.992
and yet here we are today,
about half of the rainforest remains,

00:03:48.992 --> 00:03:53.319
and we have potentially more urgent 
problems like climate change.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.228
But in fact, this is the little-known fact
that I didn't realize at the time:

00:03:57.228 --> 00:04:00.189
Deforestation accounts 
for more greenhouse gas

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.229
than all of the world's planes,
trains, cars, trucks and ships combined.

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.945
It's the second highest contributor
to climate change.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:09.778
Also, according to Interpol,

00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:13.307
as much as 90 percent of the logging
that takes place in the rainforest

00:04:13.307 --> 00:04:17.088
is illegal logging,
like the illegal logging that we saw.

00:04:17.088 --> 00:04:21.132
So if we can help people in the forest
enforce the rules that are there,

00:04:21.132 --> 00:04:25.056
then in fact we could eat heavily
into this 17 percent

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:27.667
and potentially have a major impact
in the short term.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:32.832
It might just be the cheapest,
fastest way to fight climate change.

00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:34.830
And so here's the system that we imagine.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.024
It looks super high tech.

00:04:36.024 --> 00:04:38.657
The moment a sound of a chainsaw
is heard in the forest,

00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:40.829
the device picks up the sound
of the chainsaw,

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:44.436
it sends an alert through the standard
GSM network that's already there

00:04:44.436 --> 00:04:46.523
to a ranger in the field

00:04:46.523 --> 00:04:49.340
who can in fact show up in real time
and stop the logging.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.249
It's no more about going out
and finding a tree that's been cut.

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.425
It's not about seeing 
a tree from a satellite

00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:57.061
in an area that's been clear cut,

00:04:57.061 --> 00:04:59.259
it's about real-time intervention.

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.390
So I said it was the cheapest
and fastest way to do it,

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.315
but in fact, actually, as you saw,
they weren't able to do it,

00:05:05.315 --> 00:05:07.199
so it may not be so cheap and fast.

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.635
But if the devices in the trees
were actually cell phones,

00:05:10.635 --> 00:05:12.191
it could be pretty cheap.

00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:16.478
Cell phones are thrown away
by the hundreds of millions every year,

00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:18.599
hundreds of millions in the U.S. alone,

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.780
not counting the rest of the world,
which of course we should do,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.311
but in fact, cell phones are great.

00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.644
They're full of sensors.

00:05:25.644 --> 00:05:27.796
They can listen
to the sounds of the forest.

00:05:27.796 --> 00:05:29.178
We do have to protect them.

00:05:29.178 --> 00:05:31.585
We have to put them in this box
that you see here,

00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:33.152
and we do have to power them.

00:05:33.152 --> 00:05:35.915
Powering them is one of the greater
engineering challenges

00:05:35.915 --> 00:05:37.215
that we had to deal with,

00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:39.967
because powering a cell phone
under a tree canopy,

00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:42.219
any sort of solar power
under a tree canopy,

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.029
was an as-yet-unsolved problem,

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.886
and that's this unique
solar panel design that you see here,

00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:51.205
which in fact is built also from recycled
byproducts of an industrial process.

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:53.829
These are strips that are cut down.

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:57.335
So this is me putting it all together

00:05:57.335 --> 00:05:59.216
in my parents' garage, actually.

00:05:59.216 --> 00:06:01.793
Thanks very much to them
for allowing me to do that.

00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:06.149
As you can see,
this is a device up in a tree.

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.734
What you can see from here, perhaps,
is that they are pretty well obscured

00:06:09.734 --> 00:06:11.536
up in the tree canopy at a distance.

00:06:11.536 --> 00:06:15.013
That's important, because although
they are able to hear chainsaw noises

00:06:15.013 --> 00:06:16.783
up to a kilometer in the distance,

00:06:16.783 --> 00:06:19.303
allowing them to cover
about three square kilometers,

00:06:19.303 --> 00:06:22.481
if someone were to take them,
it would make the area unprotected.

00:06:23.281 --> 00:06:26.034
So does it actually work?

00:06:26.034 --> 00:06:29.006
Well, to test it,
we took it back to Indonesia,

00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:31.119
not the same place, but another place,

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:32.790
to another gibbon reserve

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.635
that was threatened daily
by illegal logging.

00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:40.424
On the very second day, it picked up
illegal chainsaw noises.

00:06:40.424 --> 00:06:42.623
We were able to get a real-time alert.

00:06:42.623 --> 00:06:43.970
I got an email on my phone.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.686
Actually, we had just climbed the tree.
Everyone had just gotten back down.

00:06:47.686 --> 00:06:49.926
All these guys are smoking cigarettes,

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:52.783
and then I get an email,
and they all quiet down,

00:06:52.783 --> 00:06:54.887
and in fact you can hear the chainsaw

00:06:54.887 --> 00:06:56.816
really, really faint in the background,

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:59.121
but no one had noticed it 
until that moment.

00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:02.395
And so then we took off
to actually stop these loggers.

00:07:02.395 --> 00:07:03.904
I was pretty nervous.

00:07:03.904 --> 00:07:08.130
This is the moment where we've actually
arrived close to where the loggers are.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.244
This is the moment where you can see
where I'm actually regretting

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:13.245
perhaps the entire endeavor.

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:15.988
I'm not really sure what's on
the other side of this hill.

00:07:15.988 --> 00:07:17.951
That guy's much braver than I am.

00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:22.131
But he went, so I had to go, walking up,

00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:24.290
and in fact, he made it over the hill,

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.527
and interrupted the loggers in the act.

00:07:27.527 --> 00:07:29.189
For them, it was such a surprise --

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:31.569
they had never, ever
been interrupted before --

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:33.734
that it was such an impressive
event for them,

00:07:33.734 --> 00:07:36.850
that we've heard from our partners
they have not been back since.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.342
They were, in fact, great guys.

00:07:38.342 --> 00:07:40.522
They showed us how
the entire operation works,

00:07:40.522 --> 00:07:43.096
and what they really convinced us
on the spot was that

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:45.341
if you can show up
in real time and stop people,

00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:49.523
it's enough of a deterrent
they won't come back.

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:51.085
So --

00:07:51.085 --> 00:07:56.076
Thank you. (Applause)

00:07:57.586 --> 00:08:01.440
Word of this spread, possibly
because we told a lot of people,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.877
and in fact, then some really
amazing stuff started to happen.

00:08:04.877 --> 00:08:08.546
People from around the world
started to send us emails, phone calls.

00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:10.635
What we saw was that people
throughout Asia,

00:08:10.635 --> 00:08:13.377
people throughout Africa,
people throughout South America,

00:08:13.377 --> 00:08:15.288
they told us that they could use it too,

00:08:15.288 --> 00:08:16.568
and what's most important,

00:08:16.568 --> 00:08:19.066
what we'd found that
we thought might be exceptional,

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:21.648
in the forest there was
pretty good cell phone service.

00:08:21.648 --> 00:08:23.525
That was not exceptional, we were told,

00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:27.468
and that particularly is on the periphery
of the forests that are most under threat.

00:08:27.468 --> 00:08:29.768
And then something 
really amazing happened,

00:08:29.768 --> 00:08:33.251
which was that people started sending us
their own old cell phones.

00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:35.201
So in fact what we have now is a system

00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:38.544
where we can use people on the ground,
people who are already there,

00:08:38.544 --> 00:08:41.609
who can both improve
and use the existing connectivity,

00:08:41.609 --> 00:08:44.286
and we're using old cell phones
that are being sent to us

00:08:44.286 --> 00:08:45.779
by people from around the world

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:49.072
that want their phones to be doing 
something else in their afterlife,

00:08:49.072 --> 00:08:49.826
so to speak.

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:52.755
And if the rest of the device
can be completely recycled,

00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:55.471
then we believe it's
an entirely upcycled device.

00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:59.125
So again, this didn't come
because of any sort of high-tech solution.

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:01.438
It just came from using
what's already there,

00:09:01.438 --> 00:09:04.294
and I'm thoroughly convinced
that if it's not phones,

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.663
that there's always
going to be enough there

00:09:06.663 --> 00:09:08.474
that you can build similar solutions

00:09:08.474 --> 00:09:10.540
that can be very effective
in new contexts.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.676
Thank you very much.

00:09:12.676 --> 00:09:17.204
(Applause)
