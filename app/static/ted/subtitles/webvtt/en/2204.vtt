WEBVTT

00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:06.174
Twenty-five years ago, scientists at CERN
created the World Wide Web.

00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:10.083
Since then, the Internet has transformed 
the way we communicate,

00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:13.545
the way we do business,
and even the way we live.

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:15.717
In many ways,

00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:20.542
the ideas that gave birth to Google,
Facebook, Twitter, and so many others,

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:23.146
have now really transformed our lives,

00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:27.433
and this has brought us many real benefits
such as a more connected society.

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:30.234
However, there are also
some downsides to this.

00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:33.967
Today, the average person
has an astounding amount

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.080
of personal information online,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.737
and we add to this online information
every single time we post on Facebook,

00:00:39.737 --> 00:00:41.939
each time we search on Google,

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:43.721
and each time we send an email.

00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:46.343
Now, many of us probably think,

00:00:46.343 --> 00:00:49.453
well, one email,
there's nothing in there, right?

00:00:49.453 --> 00:00:52.659
But if you consider
a year's worth of emails,

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.561
or maybe even a lifetime of email,

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:57.907
collectively, this tells a lot.

00:00:57.907 --> 00:01:01.470
It tells where we have been,
who we have met,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.709
and in many ways,
even what we're thinking about.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.086
And the more scary part about this is
our data now lasts forever,

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:12.093
so your data can and will outlive you.

00:01:12.093 --> 00:01:15.622
What has happened is that we've largely
lost control over our data

00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:17.944
and also our privacy.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:21.474
So this year, as the web turns 25,

00:01:21.474 --> 00:01:23.772
it's very important for us
to take a moment

00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:26.304
and think about the implications of this.

00:01:26.304 --> 00:01:28.006
We have to really think.

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:29.796
We've lost privacy, yes,

00:01:29.796 --> 00:01:33.125
but actually what we've also lost
is the idea of privacy itself.

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:35.749
If you think about it,

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:39.763
most of us here today probably remember 
what life was like before the Internet,

00:01:39.763 --> 00:01:42.305
but today, there's a new generation

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:45.725
that is being taught from a very young age
to share everything online,

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:50.204
and this is a generation that is not 
going to remember when data was private.

00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:53.592
So we keep going down this road,
20 years from now,

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:56.688
the word 'privacy' is going to have
a completely different meaning

00:01:56.688 --> 00:01:58.973
from what it means to you and I.

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:01.413
So, it's time for us 
to take a moment and think,

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:04.220
is there anything we can do about this?

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.705
And I believe there is.

00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:10.266
Let's take a look at one of the most
widely used forms of communication

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:12.533
in the world today: email.

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:16.294
Before the invention of email,
we largely communicated using letters,

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:18.616
and the process was quite simple.

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:21.728
You would first start by writing
your message on a piece of paper,

00:02:21.728 --> 00:02:24.132
then you would place it
into a sealed envelope,

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:26.387
and from there,
you would go ahead and send it

00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:28.345
after you put a stamp and address on it.

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:29.825
Unfortunately, today,

00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:32.642
when we actually send an email,
we're not sending a letter.

00:02:32.642 --> 00:02:35.417
What you are sending, in many ways,
is actually a postcard,

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:39.064
and it's a postcard in the sense
that everybody that sees it

00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:42.699
from the time it leaves your computer
to when it gets to the recipient

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.319
can actually read the entire contents.

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.778
So, the solution to this
has been known for some time,

00:02:48.778 --> 00:02:50.621
and there's many attempts to do it.

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:53.770
The most basic solution
is to use encryption,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.697
and the idea is quite simple.

00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:57.466
First, you encrypt the connection

00:02:57.466 --> 00:03:00.074
between your computer
and the email server.

00:03:00.074 --> 00:03:03.700
Then, you also encrypt the data
as it sits on the server itself.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.646
But there's a problem with this,

00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:08.595
and that is, the email servers
also hold the encryption keys,

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:12.980
so now you have a really big lock
with a key placed right next to it.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.211
But not only that, any government
could lawfully ask for

00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.441
and get the key to your data,

00:03:18.441 --> 00:03:21.064
and this is all without you
being aware of it.

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:26.337
So the way we fix this problem
is actually relatively easy, in principle:

00:03:26.337 --> 00:03:28.739
You give everybody their own keys,

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.012
and then you make sure the server
doesn't actually have the keys.

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:34.148
This seems like common sense, right?

00:03:34.148 --> 00:03:37.751
So the question that comes up is,
why hasn't this been done yet?

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:40.796
Well, if we really think about it,

00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:43.721
we see that the business model
of the Internet today

00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:45.788
really isn't compatible with privacy.

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:48.574
Just take a look at some
of the biggest names on the web,

00:03:48.574 --> 00:03:51.501
and you see that advertising
plays a huge role.

00:03:51.501 --> 00:03:56.329
In fact, this year alone,
advertising is 137 billion dollars,

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.500
and to optimize the ads
that are shown to us,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.633
companies have to know
everything about us.

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:02.552
They need to know where we live,

00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:06.207
how old we are, what we like,
what we don't like,

00:04:06.207 --> 00:04:08.369
and anything else
they can get their hands on.

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:10.098
And if you think about it,

00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:14.246
the best way to get this information
is really just to invade our privacy.

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:17.437
So these companies
aren't going to give us our privacy.

00:04:17.437 --> 00:04:19.252
If we want to have privacy online,

00:04:19.252 --> 00:04:22.795
what we have to do is
we've got to go out and get it ourselves.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:25.063
For many years, when it came to email,

00:04:25.063 --> 00:04:27.978
the only solution
was something known as PGP,

00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:31.192
which was quite complicated
and only accessible to the tech-savvy.

00:04:31.192 --> 00:04:33.610
Here's a diagram that basically shows

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.345
the process for encrypting
and decrypting messages.

00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:39.231
So needless to say,
this is not a solution for everybody,

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:42.363
and this actually is part of the problem,

00:04:42.363 --> 00:04:44.825
because if you think about communication,

00:04:44.825 --> 00:04:49.180
by definition, it involves
having someone to communicate with.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.394
So while PGP does a great job
of what it's designed to do,

00:04:52.394 --> 00:04:55.215
for the people out there
who can't understand how to use it,

00:04:55.215 --> 00:04:58.117
the option to communicate privately
simply does not exist.

00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:01.125
And this is a problem
that we need to solve.

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:03.123
So if we want to have privacy online,

00:05:03.123 --> 00:05:06.442
the only way we can succeed
is if we get the whole world on board,

00:05:06.442 --> 00:05:09.693
and this is only possible
if we bring down the barrier to entry.

00:05:09.693 --> 00:05:13.222
I think this is actually the key challenge
that lies in the tech community.

00:05:13.222 --> 00:05:17.285
What we really have to do
is work and make privacy more accessible.

00:05:17.285 --> 00:05:20.281
So last summer, when
the Edward Snowden story came out,

00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:23.896
several colleagues and I decided to see
if we could make this happen.

00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:28.883
At that time, we were working at the
European Organization for Nuclear Research

00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:32.614
at the world's largest particle collider,
which collides protons, by the way.

00:05:32.614 --> 00:05:36.059
We were all scientists,
so we used our scientific creativity

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:38.683
and came up with a very
creative name for our project:

00:05:39.293 --> 00:05:41.389
ProtonMail.
(Laughter)

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.257
Many startups these days
actually begin in people's garages

00:05:44.257 --> 00:05:45.941
or people's basements.

00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:47.438
We were a bit different.

00:05:47.438 --> 00:05:50.081
We started out at the CERN cafeteria,

00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:52.537
which actually is great, because look,

00:05:52.537 --> 00:05:55.010
you have all the food
and water you could ever want.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.490
But even better than this
is that every day

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.461
between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m.,
free of charge,

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:05.710
the CERN cafeteria comes with
several thousand scientists and engineers,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.496
and these guys basically know
the answers to everything.

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:11.283
So it was in this environment
that we began working.

00:06:11.283 --> 00:06:14.394
What we actually want to do
is we want to take your email

00:06:14.394 --> 00:06:17.854
and turn it into something
that looks more like this,

00:06:17.854 --> 00:06:20.129
but more importantly,
we want to do it in a way

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.274
that you can't even tell
that it's happened.

00:06:22.274 --> 00:06:25.261
So to do this, we actually need
a combination of technology

00:06:25.261 --> 00:06:26.848
and also design.

00:06:26.848 --> 00:06:29.138
So how do we go about
doing something like this?

00:06:30.018 --> 00:06:34.172
Well, it's probably a good idea
not to put the keys on the server.

00:06:34.172 --> 00:06:38.070
So what we do is we generate
encryption keys on your computer,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.858
and we don't generate a single key,
but actually a pair of keys,

00:06:41.858 --> 00:06:45.563
so there's an RSA private key
and an RSA public key,

00:06:45.563 --> 00:06:48.191
and these keys
are mathematically connected.

00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:50.396
So let's have a look
and see how this works

00:06:50.396 --> 00:06:52.787
when multiple people communicate.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:57.232
So here we have Bob and Alice,
who want to communicate privately.

00:06:57.232 --> 00:07:00.794
So the key challenge
is to take Bob's message

00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:05.103
and to get it to Alice in such a way
that the server cannot read that message.

00:07:05.103 --> 00:07:07.516
So what we have to do
is we have to encrypt it

00:07:07.516 --> 00:07:09.640
before it even leaves Bob's computer,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.141
and one of the tricks is, we encrypt it
using the public key from Alice.

00:07:14.141 --> 00:07:19.333
Now this encrypted data is sent
through the server to Alice,

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:23.613
and because the message was encrypted
using Alice's public key,

00:07:23.613 --> 00:07:27.901
the only key that can now decrypt it
is a private key that belongs to Alice,

00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:32.616
and it turns out Alice is the only person
that actually has this key.

00:07:32.616 --> 00:07:35.284
So we've now accomplished the objective,

00:07:35.284 --> 00:07:37.451
which is to get the message
from Bob to Alice

00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:40.143
without the server being able
to read what's going on.

00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:43.100
Actually, what I've shown here
is a highly simplified picture.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.105
The reality is much more complex

00:07:45.105 --> 00:07:48.819
and it requires a lot of software
that looks a bit like this.

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:51.259
And that's actually
the key design challenge:

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:54.780
How do we take all this complexity,
all this software,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.898
and implement it in a way
that the user cannot see it.

00:07:58.898 --> 00:08:02.496
I think with ProtonMail,
we have gotten pretty close to doing this.

00:08:02.496 --> 00:08:04.958
So let's see how it works in practice.

00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.975
Here, we've got Bob and Alice again,

00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:09.945
who also want to communicate securely.

00:08:09.945 --> 00:08:12.132
They simply create accounts on ProtonMail,

00:08:12.132 --> 00:08:14.542
which is quite simple
and takes a few moments,

00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:16.964
and all the key encryption and generation

00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:19.354
is happening automatically
in the background

00:08:19.354 --> 00:08:21.060
as Bob is creating his account.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.602
Once his account is created,
he just clicks "compose,"

00:08:23.602 --> 00:08:26.589
and now he can write his email
like he does today.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.456
So he fills in his information,

00:08:28.456 --> 00:08:31.740
and then after that, 
all he has to do is click "send,"

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.281
and just like that,
without understanding cryptography,

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:38.834
and without doing anything different
from how he writes email today,

00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:41.481
Bob has just sent an encrypted message.

00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:45.593
What we have here
is really just the first step,

00:08:45.593 --> 00:08:47.890
but it shows that
with improving technology,

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.065
privacy doesn't have to be difficult,
it doesn't have to be disruptive.

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:56.512
If we change the goal from maximizing 
ad revenue to protecting data,

00:08:56.512 --> 00:08:59.008
we can actually make it accessible.

00:08:59.008 --> 00:09:01.468
Now, I know a question
on everybody's minds is,

00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:03.858
okay, protecting privacy,
this is a great goal,

00:09:03.858 --> 00:09:06.298
but can you actually do this

00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:09.090
without the tons of money
that advertisements give you?

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.476
And I think the answer is actually yes,

00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:13.706
because today, we've reached a point

00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:17.652
where people around the world really
understand how important privacy is,

00:09:17.652 --> 00:09:20.625
and when you have that,
anything is possible.

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:21.789
Earlier this year,

00:09:21.789 --> 00:09:25.454
ProtonMail actually had so many users 
that we ran out of resources,

00:09:25.454 --> 00:09:28.283
and when this happened,
our community of users got together

00:09:28.283 --> 00:09:30.399
and donated half a million dollars.

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:32.830
So this is just an example
of what can happen

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.643
when you bring the community together
towards a common goal.

00:09:35.643 --> 00:09:37.379
We can also leverage the world.

00:09:37.449 --> 00:09:38.597
Right now,

00:09:38.597 --> 00:09:42.023
we have a quarter of a million people
that have signed up for ProtonMail,

00:09:42.023 --> 00:09:43.832
and these people come from everywhere,

00:09:43.832 --> 00:09:45.464
and this really shows that privacy

00:09:45.464 --> 00:09:47.716
is not just an American
or a European issue,

00:09:47.716 --> 00:09:50.061
it's a global issue
that impacts all of us.

00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:53.521
It's something that we really
have to pay attention to going forward.

00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:56.517
So what do we have to do
to solve this problem?

00:09:56.517 --> 00:09:58.514
Well, first of all,

00:09:58.514 --> 00:10:01.508
we need to support a different
business model for the Internet,

00:10:01.508 --> 00:10:03.841
one that does not rely
entirely on advertisements

00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:06.175
for revenue and for growth.

00:10:06.175 --> 00:10:08.684
We actually need to build a new Internet

00:10:08.684 --> 00:10:14.377
where our privacy and our ability 
to control our data is first and foremost.

00:10:14.377 --> 00:10:16.122
But even more importantly,

00:10:16.122 --> 00:10:20.990
we have to build an Internet 
where privacy is no longer just an option

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.893
but is also the default.

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:26.493
We have done the first step
with ProtonMail,

00:10:26.493 --> 00:10:30.074
but this is really just the first step
in a very, very long journey.

00:10:30.074 --> 00:10:32.997
The good news I can share
with you guys today,

00:10:32.997 --> 00:10:35.525
the exciting news,
is that we're not traveling alone.

00:10:35.525 --> 00:10:38.375
The movement to protect people's privacy
and freedom online

00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:39.861
is really gaining momentum,

00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:43.455
and today, there are dozens of projects
from all around the world

00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:46.966
who are working together
to improve our privacy.

00:10:46.966 --> 00:10:50.612
These projects protect things
from our chat to voice communications,

00:10:50.612 --> 00:10:53.416
also our file storage, our online search,

00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:56.457
our online browsing,
and many other things.

00:10:56.457 --> 00:10:59.986
And these projects are not backed
by billions of dollars in advertising,

00:10:59.986 --> 00:11:02.309
but they've found support
really from the people,

00:11:02.309 --> 00:11:05.356
from private individuals like you and I
from all over the world.

00:11:05.356 --> 00:11:08.473
This really matters, because ultimately,

00:11:08.473 --> 00:11:11.944
privacy depends on each
and every one of us,

00:11:11.944 --> 00:11:14.777
and we have to protect it now
because our online data

00:11:14.777 --> 00:11:17.541
is more than just a collection
of ones and zeros.

00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:19.397
It's actually a lot more than that.

00:11:19.397 --> 00:11:21.743
It's our lives, our personal stories,

00:11:21.743 --> 00:11:24.041
our friends, our families,

00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:27.547
and in many ways,
also our hopes and our aspirations.

00:11:27.547 --> 00:11:30.651
We need to spend time now
to really protect our right

00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:33.601
to share this only with people
that we want to share this with,

00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:36.341
because without this,
we simply can't have a free society.

00:11:36.341 --> 00:11:39.194
So now's the time for us
to collectively stand up and say,

00:11:39.194 --> 00:11:42.687
yes, we do want to live
in a world with online privacy,

00:11:42.687 --> 00:11:47.215
and yes, we can work together
to turn this vision into a reality.

00:11:47.215 --> 00:11:49.350
Thank you.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:56.107
(Applause)
