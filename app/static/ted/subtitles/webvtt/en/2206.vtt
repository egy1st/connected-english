WEBVTT

00:00:00.747 --> 00:00:06.923
I'd like to start my performance by saying
90 percent of everything is crap.

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:08.149
(Laughter)

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.426
It's called Sturgeon's law,
and what that means

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:15.264
is that the majority of anything
is always bad.

00:00:17.447 --> 00:00:19.226
I have a giraffe here.

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:21.510
I'm going to throw the giraffe
behind my back

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.714
and whoever catches it is going
to help me on this next thing.

00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:29.655
Sir, you caught the giraffe.

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.961
I have a playing card in my hand.

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:36.776
Freely name any card in the deck.

00:00:37.577 --> 00:00:39.229
Audience member: 10 of hearts.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:40.916
Helder GuimarÃ£es: 10 of hearts.

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:43.019
You could have named any card in the deck,

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.295
but you said the 10 of hearts.

00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:47.830
Ninety percent of everything is crap,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.703
so there's this to prove that
Sturgeon was correct.

00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:53.218
(Laughter)

00:00:53.218 --> 00:00:57.011
(Applause)

00:00:57.011 --> 00:01:00.804
(Laughter)

00:01:01.404 --> 00:01:04.597
Sir, this is not your show.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:08.933
(Laughter)

00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:12.452
Keep the giraffe for a moment, okay?

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:14.793
Jesus.

00:01:14.793 --> 00:01:16.884
(Laughter)

00:01:16.884 --> 00:01:18.636
Crazy people.

00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:22.015
Well, the truth is,

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:26.828
why is the majority of everything bad?

00:01:26.828 --> 00:01:31.011
And my answer is: I think we stop
thinking too soon.

00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:33.031
I'll give you a clear little example,

00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:37.164
something that people used to do
around the turn of the century --

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:39.570
not this century, the other one.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.574
The idea was to take a piece of paper

00:01:42.574 --> 00:01:47.802
and fold it inside out
using only your weaker hand,

00:01:47.802 --> 00:01:49.657
in my case, the left hand.

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:54.113
Something that would look like this.

00:02:01.858 --> 00:02:05.467
By the way you reacted, I can see
your lack of interest.

00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:07.105
(Laughter)

00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:09.116
But that's okay, I understand why.

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:10.792
We stop thinking too soon.

00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:12.928
But if we give it
a little bit more thought,

00:02:12.928 --> 00:02:14.296
like a paper clip.

00:02:14.296 --> 00:02:19.876
A paper clip makes this a little bit
more interesting.

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:22.867
Not only that, if instead of using
my hand with the fingers,

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:24.945
I use my hand closed into a fist,

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:28.319
that makes this even a little
bit more interesting.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.210
Not only that, but I will impose myself
a time limit of one second,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.240
something that would look like this.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.231
Now -- no, no, no.

00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:45.698
Sturgeon may be correct.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.996
But he doesn't have to be correct forever.

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:49.214
Things can always change.

00:02:49.214 --> 00:02:51.291
Sir, what was the card?

00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:53.410
The 10 of hearts?

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.573
There's this to prove that things
can always change --

00:02:58.573 --> 00:03:00.839
the 10 of hearts.

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:03.998
(Applause)

00:03:03.998 --> 00:03:07.264
Secrets are important.

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:10.406
And secrets are valuable.

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:14.890
And this is the best secret
I've ever experienced.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.981
It starts with a deck of cards
onto the table,

00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:21.139
an old man and a claim,

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.340
"I will not touch the deck till the end."

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.028
It doesn't matter who the man was,

00:03:27.028 --> 00:03:32.563
all that matters was that sentence
ringing in my head:

00:03:32.642 --> 00:03:36.476
"I will not touch the deck till the end."

00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:38.111
Now, during all this time,

00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:40.451
he was holding a small notebook

00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:43.262
that sometimes he would open
and flip through the pages

00:03:43.262 --> 00:03:44.865
and look at something.

00:03:44.865 --> 00:03:48.489
But I was not really
paying attention to the book

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.076
because I was paying attention the deck
and the claim he had made before,

00:03:53.076 --> 00:03:56.520
"I will not touch the deck till the end."

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.215
Now sir, you have the giraffe.

00:03:58.215 --> 00:03:59.905
Go ahead, throw it in any direction

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:02.122
so that you can find
someone else at random.

00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:07.157
Perfect. Sir, you're going to play
my role in this story.

00:04:07.157 --> 00:04:09.281
The old man turned to me and he said,

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:11.678
"You could pick a red card
or a black card."

00:04:11.678 --> 00:04:13.069
My answer was ...

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.719
Audience member 2: The black card.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.030
HG: Indeed!

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.638
It was a black card.

00:04:18.194 --> 00:04:20.707
He said, "It could be a club or a spade,"

00:04:20.707 --> 00:04:22.460
and my answer was ...

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.067
Audience member 2: Spade.

00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:27.819
HG: Indeed! It was a spade.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.954
He said, "It could be a high spade
or a low spade."

00:04:30.954 --> 00:04:32.819
And my answer was ...

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.517
Audience member 2: A high spade.

00:04:34.517 --> 00:04:37.197
HG: Indeed! It was a high spade.

00:04:37.197 --> 00:04:39.650
Since it's a high spade,
it could be a nine, a 10,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.573
a jack, king, queen or the ace of spades.

00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:44.418
And my answer was ...

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:46.159
Audience member 2: The king.

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.211
HG: The king of spades, indeed.

00:04:50.275 --> 00:04:51.417
Now sir, let's be fair.

00:04:51.417 --> 00:04:54.421
You selected black, you selected spade,

00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:57.011
you selected the high spade,
and you selected -- sorry?

00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.130
Audience member 2: King.
HG: King of spades.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.334
Did you feel I influenced you
in any decision?

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.050
Audience member 2: No, I just felt
your energy.

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:05.931
HG: But it was a free choice, correct?

00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:08.094
Because if not, we could start
all over again.

00:05:08.094 --> 00:05:10.639
But it was really fair?
Audience member 2: Absolutely.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.958
HG: Now, the old man turned to me
and he asked me one more question,

00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:17.024
a number between one and 52.

00:05:17.024 --> 00:05:19.479
And the first number I thought of was ...

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:20.841
Audience member 2: 17.

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:24.918
HG: Indeed! It was the 17.

00:05:24.918 --> 00:05:27.977
The old man only said one more thing:

00:05:27.977 --> 00:05:30.796
"This is the end."

00:05:30.796 --> 00:05:34.984
And I knew exactly what that meant.

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:37.621
I knew that he was going
to touch the deck.

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:45.177
Everything that you're about to see
is exactly as it looked.

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:48.748
He took the deck out of the box.

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:50.597
Nothing in the box.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:06:01.050
He counted, "One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10."

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:03.716
The tension was building.

00:06:04.092 --> 00:06:06.986
(Laughter)

00:06:07.758 --> 00:06:16.140
"11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17."

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:21.556
And on the 17, instead of
the king of spades,

00:06:21.556 --> 00:06:25.607
something appeared
in the middle of the deck,

00:06:25.607 --> 00:06:30.362
that later, I would realize
was actually a secret.

00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:34.743
The old man stood up, he left.

00:06:34.743 --> 00:06:36.103
I never saw him again.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.462
But he left his notebook

00:06:40.462 --> 00:06:42.373
that was there from the beginning.

00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:45.566
And when I picked it up,

00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:51.150
that was the best secret
I've ever experienced.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.401
We are defined by the secrets we keep

00:06:56.401 --> 00:06:58.552
and by the secrets we share.

00:06:58.552 --> 00:07:03.417
And this was his way
of sharing a secret with me.

00:07:03.417 --> 00:07:08.070
(Applause)

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.398
Crazy shit! Now --

00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:16.746
(Laughter)

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:24.575
I believe that amazing things
happen all the time.

00:07:24.575 --> 00:07:26.242
I really do.

00:07:26.242 --> 00:07:29.420
And the reason why we don't see
them as often,

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.366
it's because we don't
place ourselves in a position

00:07:32.366 --> 00:07:34.864
to search for those amazing things.

00:07:35.748 --> 00:07:40.502
But what if we decided to search
for those amazing things,

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:46.160
for those small coincidences
in life that are truly amazing?

00:07:46.742 --> 00:07:48.355
So you have the giraffe,

00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:52.836
go ahead, throw it in any direction
so you find one last person at random.

00:07:54.838 --> 00:07:57.861
Sir, I'm going to ask you,

00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:03.197
do you have, with you,
a United States $1 bill?

00:08:03.197 --> 00:08:04.835
Audience member 3: I think so.

00:08:04.835 --> 00:08:07.473
HG: Yes? You see, a coincidence!

00:08:07.473 --> 00:08:10.177
(Laughter)

00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:12.001
Let's make sure you have it.

00:08:12.001 --> 00:08:13.291
Do you have it?

00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:15.565
Audience member 3: Yes.
HG: Yes! Perfect.

00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:18.539
Now, I want you to do exactly the same
thing I am about to do.

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:20.330
I have a dollar bill here to explain.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.069
I want you to take the dollar bill,

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:25.599
and fold the Washington part
inside, like this.

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:28.579
So you get this kind of big square, okay?

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:32.535
Now, I want you to take the bill
and fold it like this, lengthwise,

00:08:32.535 --> 00:08:34.054
so it becomes like a rectangle,

00:08:34.054 --> 00:08:36.573
and then again --
really fold it, really crease it --

00:08:36.573 --> 00:08:38.057
and when you have it,

00:08:38.057 --> 00:08:41.533
please fold the bill again
into a little square like this

00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:43.861
and let me know when you have it.

00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:45.936
Do you have it? Perfect.

00:08:45.936 --> 00:08:48.301
Now, I'm going to approach,

00:08:48.301 --> 00:08:49.800
and before we start,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.097
I want to make sure that we do this
in very, very serious conditions.

00:08:53.097 --> 00:08:58.692
First of all, I want to ensure that we
have a marker and we have a paper clip.

00:08:58.692 --> 00:09:02.149
First of all, take the marker
and go ahead and sign the bill.

00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:03.875
And this is the reason why:

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:06.506
later, I'm going to be doing
a bunch of stuff on stage

00:09:06.506 --> 00:09:08.024
and I don't want you to think,

00:09:08.024 --> 00:09:10.479
oh, while I was distracted by Helder,

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:12.558
someone came onstage and swapped the bill.

00:09:12.558 --> 00:09:15.033
So I want to make sure
it's exactly the same bill.

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:17.532
Now not only that, I want you
to take the paper clip

00:09:17.532 --> 00:09:19.732
and put it around the bill.

00:09:19.732 --> 00:09:22.338
So even if nobody comes onstage
and switches the bill,

00:09:22.338 --> 00:09:25.617
I don't have enough time
to go open the bill and close it

00:09:25.617 --> 00:09:27.256
and see what I don't want to see.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.441
Is that fair?

00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:30.228
Now you can give me the marker back.

00:09:30.228 --> 00:09:32.488
And just like that, very clearly,

00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:35.507
I want to make sure that
we place this in full view

00:09:35.507 --> 00:09:40.693
from the beginning of this experience

00:09:40.693 --> 00:09:43.174
and to make sure that everyone
is going to see it,

00:09:43.174 --> 00:09:46.939
we're going to actually have
a camera man onstage.

00:09:46.939 --> 00:09:49.249
Yes, perfect, so that you can see.

00:09:49.249 --> 00:09:51.539
That's your signature? Yes? Perfect.

00:09:51.579 --> 00:09:58.571
Now, we're going to use
also the deck and a glass for this.

00:09:59.151 --> 00:10:01.969
And we're going to put
ourselves in a position

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:04.853
to search for an amazing coincidence.

00:10:04.853 --> 00:10:06.793
Do you mind, can you help me with this?

00:10:06.793 --> 00:10:09.447
Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle.

00:10:09.447 --> 00:10:11.993
And do you mind, can you
take some cards and shuffle?

00:10:11.993 --> 00:10:14.024
You can take some cards and shuffle.

00:10:14.024 --> 00:10:16.102
You can shuffle cards
in a variety of ways.

00:10:16.102 --> 00:10:17.634
You can shuffle cards like this.

00:10:17.634 --> 00:10:19.815
You can shuffle cards
in a more messed up way,

00:10:19.815 --> 00:10:20.870
something like this.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.913
You can shuffle cards in the American way.

00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:26.246
As a Portuguese, I don't feel entitled
to teach you guys how to do it.

00:10:26.246 --> 00:10:28.698
But the important part is
after shuffling the cards,

00:10:28.698 --> 00:10:30.951
always remember
to cut and complete the cards.

00:10:30.951 --> 00:10:32.663
Do you mind doing that for me, sir?

00:10:32.663 --> 00:10:33.859
Please cut and complete.

00:10:33.859 --> 00:10:36.521
And when you have it,
place the cards up in the air.

00:10:36.521 --> 00:10:38.760
And you too, cut and complete
and up in the air.

00:10:38.784 --> 00:10:40.025
Up in the air.

00:10:40.025 --> 00:10:44.403
A deck of cards cut and shuffled
by one, two, three, four and five people.

00:10:44.403 --> 00:10:48.964
Now, very clearly, I'm going
to gather the deck together.

00:10:50.494 --> 00:10:53.233
And just like that.

00:10:54.163 --> 00:11:00.345
I'm going to search for a coincidence
in front of everyone.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:05.478
I'm going to try.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.689
I have some cards that maybe,

00:11:17.689 --> 00:11:19.972
maybe they don't mean anything.

00:11:20.904 --> 00:11:23.675
But maybe that's because
we are not paying close attention.

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:28.317
Because maybe, maybe they mean a lot.

00:11:28.317 --> 00:11:31.766
Before we start,
sir, you gave me a dollar bill.

00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:33.649
Is that your signature?

00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:35.069
Audience member 3: Yes it is.

00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:39.174
HG: I want you to see very clearly

00:11:39.174 --> 00:11:42.431
that I'm going to open your bill

00:11:42.431 --> 00:11:47.228
and reveal a small secret that we created.

00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:53.357
And the secret of this dollar bill
is the serial number.

00:11:53.357 --> 00:11:56.280
Madam, can you take the dollar bill?

00:11:57.296 --> 00:11:59.242
In the serial number, there is a letter.

00:11:59.242 --> 00:12:02.485
What is the first number after the letter?

00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:03.985
Audience member 4: Seven.

00:12:03.985 --> 00:12:05.884
HG: Seven.

00:12:05.884 --> 00:12:07.286
Seven.

00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:11.509
But, that's maybe just one coincidence.

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:14.131
What is the second number?
Audience member 4: Nine.

00:12:14.131 --> 00:12:17.921
So after the seven, we have a nine.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.506
And after the nine?

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:21.613
Audience member 4: Two.

00:12:21.613 --> 00:12:23.633
HG: The two. And after the two?

00:12:23.633 --> 00:12:24.875
Audience member 4: Three.

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:26.518
HG: Three, and after?

00:12:26.518 --> 00:12:28.484
Audience member 4: Three.
HG: Three.

00:12:28.484 --> 00:12:30.540
Audience member 4: Seven.
HG: Seven.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.274
Audience member 4: Four.
HG: Four.

00:12:32.274 --> 00:12:34.788
Audience member 4: Two.
HG: Two, and?

00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:36.718
Audience member 4: Q.

00:12:36.718 --> 00:12:40.590
HG: Q like in queen?

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.280
(Applause)

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.590
The queen of clubs!

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.420
All the cards in order, just for you.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.716
And that's my show.

00:12:48.716 --> 00:12:51.623
Thank you very much and have a nice night.

00:12:51.623 --> 00:12:58.219
(Applause)
