00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:05.013
We need to change the culture
in our jails and prisons,

00:00:05.013 --> 00:00:07.520
especially for young inmates.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.842
New York state is one
of only two in the U.S.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:14.340
that automatically arrests and tries
16- to 17-year-olds as adults.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.297
This culture of violence
takes these young people

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:19.339
and puts them in a hostile environment,

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.381
and the correctional officers pretty much
allow any and everything to go on.

00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:26.188
There's not really much
for these young people to do

00:00:26.188 --> 00:00:29.718
to actually enhance their talent
and actually rehabilitate them.

00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:34.284
Until we can raise the age
of criminal responsibility to 18,

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.535
we need to focus on changing
the daily lives of these young people.

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:39.729
I know firsthand.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.908
Before I ever turned 18,

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:45.855
I spent approximately
400 days on Rikers Island,

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:47.109
and to add to that

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.963
I spent almost 300 days
in solitary confinement,

00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:52.660
and let me tell you this:

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.768
Screaming at the top of your lungs
all day on your cell door

00:00:56.768 --> 00:00:59.345
or screaming at the top
of your lungs out the window,

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:01.267
it gets tiring.

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:04.064
Since there's not much for you to do
while you're in there,

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.347
you start pacing
back and forth in your cell,

00:01:06.347 --> 00:01:08.483
you start talking to yourself,

00:01:08.483 --> 00:01:10.480
your thoughts start running wild,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.963
and then your thoughts
become your own worst enemy.

00:01:13.963 --> 00:01:16.958
Jails are actually supposed
to rehabilitate a person,

00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.651
not cause him or her
to become more angry,

00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:22.391
frustrated, and feel more hopeless.

00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:26.294
Since there's not a discharge plan
put in place for these young people,

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:29.889
they pretty much 
reenter society with nothing.

00:01:31.168 --> 00:01:34.973
And there's not really much for them to do
to keep them from recidivating.

00:01:35.823 --> 00:01:38.005
But it all starts with the C.O.s.

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:40.513
It's very easy for some people

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:43.207
to look at these correctional officers
as the good guys

00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:45.482
and the inmates as the bad guys,

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:47.178
or vice versa for some,

00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:48.849
but it's a little more than that.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.844
See, these C.O.s are normal,
everyday people.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:56.885
They come from the same neighborhoods
as the population they "serve."

00:01:57.725 --> 00:01:59.597
They're just normal people.

00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:03.261
They're not robots, and there's 
nothing special about them.

00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:07.023
They do pretty much everything
anybody else in society does.

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:10.922
The male C.O.s want to talk
and flirt with the female C.O.s.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.731
They play the little high school
kid games with each other.

00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:15.635
They politic with one another.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:19.954
And the female C.O.s gossip to each other.

00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:25.944
So I spent numerous amounts of time
with numerous amounts of C.O.s,

00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:28.856
and let me tell you about
this one in particular named Monroe.

00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:31.354
One day he pulled me
in between the A and B doors

00:02:31.354 --> 00:02:34.673
which separate the north
and south sides of our housing unit.

00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:37.270
He pulled me there because I had
a physical altercation

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.290
with another young man in my housing unit,

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.773
and he felt, since there was
a female officer working on the floor,

00:02:42.773 --> 00:02:45.258
that I violated his shift.

00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:47.255
So he punched me in my chest.

00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:49.391
He kind of knocked the wind out of me.

00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:52.248
I wasn't impulsive,
I didn't react right away,

00:02:52.248 --> 00:02:54.896
because I know this is their house.

00:02:54.896 --> 00:02:56.746
I have no wins.

00:02:56.746 --> 00:03:02.174
All he has to do is pull his pin
and backup will come immediately.

00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:05.645
So I just gave him a look in his eyes

00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:08.904
and I guess he saw the anger
and frustration just burning,

00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:10.869
and he said to me,

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:13.331
"Your eyes are going to get you
in a lot of trouble,

00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:15.837
because you're looking
like you want to fight."

00:03:15.837 --> 00:03:18.206
So he commenced
to taking off his utility belt,

00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:20.297
he took off his shirt and his badge,

00:03:20.297 --> 00:03:22.334
and he said, "We could fight."

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:25.151
So I asked him, "You gonna hold it down?"

00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:28.064
Now, that's a term that's
commonly used on Rikers Island

00:03:28.064 --> 00:03:30.731
meaning that you're not
going to say anything to anybody,

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:32.958
and you're not going to report it.

00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.735
He said, "Yeah, I'm gonna hold it down.
You gonna hold it down?"

00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:38.406
I didn't even respond.

00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:40.331
I just punched him right in his face,

00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:43.027
and we began fighting
right then and there.

00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:47.347
Towards the end of the fight,
he slammed me up against the wall,

00:03:47.347 --> 00:03:50.852
so while we were tussled up,
he said to me, "You good?"

00:03:50.852 --> 00:03:52.617
as if he got the best of me,

00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:55.241
but in my mind, I know
I got the best of him,

00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:57.244
so I replied very cocky,

00:03:57.244 --> 00:03:59.372
"Oh, I'm good, you good?"

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:01.366
He said, "Yeah, I'm good, 
I'm good."

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:05.532
We let go, he shook my hand,
said he gave me my respect,

00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:08.903
gave me a cigarette and sent me on my way.

00:04:09.723 --> 00:04:13.464
Believe it or not, you come across
some C.O.s on Rikers Island

00:04:13.464 --> 00:04:16.040
that'll fight you one-on-one.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.247
They feel that they understand how it is,

00:04:18.247 --> 00:04:21.055
and they feel that I'm going
to meet you where you're at.

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:23.551
Since this is how you commonly
handle your disputes,

00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:25.630
we can handle it in that manner.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.904
I walk away from it like a man,
you walk away from it like a man,

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:30.325
and that's it.

00:04:30.325 --> 00:04:32.477
Some C.O.s feel that
they're jailing with you.

00:04:32.477 --> 00:04:35.047
This is why they have that mentality
and that attitude

00:04:35.047 --> 00:04:37.078
and they go by that concept.

00:04:37.078 --> 00:04:40.543
In some instances, we're in it
together with the C.O.s.

00:04:40.543 --> 00:04:43.617
However, institutions need to give
these correctional officers

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.995
proper trainings on how to properly deal
with the adolescent population,

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.240
and they also need
to give them proper trainings

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.777
on how to deal with 
the mental health population as well.

00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:56.086
These C.O.s play a big factor
in these young people's lives

00:04:56.086 --> 00:04:59.444
for x amount of time until a disposition
is reached on their case.

00:04:59.444 --> 00:05:04.101
So why not try to mentor
these young people while they're there?

00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:08.322
Why not try to give them some type
of insight to make a change,

00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:11.783
so once they reenter back into society,

00:05:11.783 --> 00:05:15.407
they're doing something positive?

00:05:16.217 --> 00:05:21.626
A second big thing to help our teens
in jails is better programming.

00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:25.644
When I was on Rikers Island,
the huge thing was solitary confinement.

00:05:25.644 --> 00:05:28.373
Solitary confinement
was originally designed

00:05:28.373 --> 00:05:32.065
to break a person mentally,
physically and emotionally.

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:34.876
That's what it was designed for.

00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:38.224
The U.S. Attorney General
recently released a report

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:40.749
stating that they're going
to ban solitary confinement

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:43.168
in New York state for teens.

00:05:43.698 --> 00:05:47.900
One thing that kept me sane while I
was in solitary confinement was reading.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.802
I tried to educate myself
as much as possible.

00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:53.427
I read any and everything
I could get my hands on.

00:05:53.427 --> 00:05:57.118
And aside from that,
I wrote music and short stories.

00:05:57.118 --> 00:06:02.194
Some programs that I feel
would benefit our young people

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:05.245
are art therapy programs

00:06:05.245 --> 00:06:08.310
for the kids that like to draw
and have that talent,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.252
and what about the young individuals
that are musically inclined?

00:06:12.252 --> 00:06:15.139
How about a music program for them
that actually teaches them

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.536
how to write and make music?

00:06:17.536 --> 00:06:18.960
Just a thought.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.029
When adolescents come to Rikers Island,

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:25.143
C74, RNDC is the building
that they're housed in.

00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:28.704
That's nicknamed "gladiator school,"

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:31.586
because you have a young individual
coming in from the street

00:06:31.586 --> 00:06:33.363
thinking that they're tough,

00:06:33.363 --> 00:06:36.683
being surrounded by a bunch
of other young individuals

00:06:36.683 --> 00:06:40.327
from all of the five boroughs,
and everybody feels that they're tough.

00:06:40.327 --> 00:06:44.322
So now you have a bunch of young gentlemen
poking their chests out

00:06:44.322 --> 00:06:47.712
feeling that I have to prove
I'm equally as tough as you

00:06:47.712 --> 00:06:50.146
or I'm tougher than you, you and you.

00:06:50.146 --> 00:06:51.734
But let's be honest:

00:06:51.734 --> 00:06:56.625
That culture is very dangerous
and damaging to our young people.

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:59.579
We need to help institutions
and these teens realize

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:02.874
that they don't have to lead
the previous lifestyle that they led

00:07:02.874 --> 00:07:06.311
when they were on the street,
that they can actually make a change.

00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:09.762
It's sad to report
that while I was in prison,

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:13.991
I used to hear dudes talking about
when they get released from prison,

00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:17.079
what type of crimes
they're going to commit

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:19.703
when they get back in the street.

00:07:19.703 --> 00:07:22.396
The conversations used to sound
something like this:

00:07:23.616 --> 00:07:26.443
"Oh, when I hit the street,
my brother got this connection

00:07:26.443 --> 00:07:27.891
for this, that and the third,"

00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:30.735
or, "My man over here
got this connection for the low price.

00:07:30.735 --> 00:07:32.142
Let's exchange information,"

00:07:32.142 --> 00:07:34.925
and, "When we hit the town,
we're going to do it real big."

00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:37.784
I used to hear these conversations
and think to myself, "Wow,

00:07:37.784 --> 00:07:40.716
these dudes are really talking about
going back in the street

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:42.248
and committing future crimes."

00:07:42.248 --> 00:07:43.990
So I came up with a name for that:

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.939
I called it a go-back-to-jail-quick scheme

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:50.523
because really, how long
is that going to last?

00:07:50.523 --> 00:07:52.883
You get a retirement plan with that?

00:07:52.883 --> 00:07:56.341
Nice little pension? 401(k)? 403(b)?

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:59.639
You get health insurance? Dental?

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:01.568
(Laughter)

00:08:01.568 --> 00:08:03.424
But I will tell you this:

00:08:03.424 --> 00:08:05.166
Being in jail and being in prison,

00:08:05.166 --> 00:08:08.788
I came across some of the most
intelligent, brilliant,

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:11.574
and talented people
that I would ever meet.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.803
I've seen individuals
take a potato chip bag

00:08:13.803 --> 00:08:16.434
and turn it into the most
beautiful picture frame.

00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:19.546
I've seen individuals take
the state soap that's provided for free

00:08:19.546 --> 00:08:21.925
and turn them into
the most beautiful sculptures

00:08:21.925 --> 00:08:26.217
that would make Michelangelo
look like a kindergartner made it.

00:08:26.217 --> 00:08:29.304
At the age of 21, I was in
a maximum-security prison

00:08:29.304 --> 00:08:31.107
called Elmira Correctional Facility.

00:08:31.107 --> 00:08:33.615
I just came out of the weight shack
from working out,

00:08:33.615 --> 00:08:37.148
and I saw an older gentleman that I knew
standing in the middle of the yard

00:08:37.148 --> 00:08:38.453
just looking up at the sky.

00:08:38.453 --> 00:08:42.649
Mind you, this older gentlemen was serving
a 33-and-a-third-to-life sentence

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:46.081
in which he already had served
20 years of that sentence.


00:08:46.081 --> 00:08:47.895
So I walk up to him and I said,

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:49.857
"O.G., what's going on, man, you good?"

00:08:49.857 --> 00:08:52.708
He looked at me, and he said,
"Yeah, I'm good, young blood."

00:08:52.708 --> 00:08:55.441
I'm like, "So what are you looking
up at the sky for, man?

00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:57.139
What's so fascinating up there?"

00:08:57.139 --> 00:08:59.817
He said, "You look up
and you tell me what you see."

00:09:01.087 --> 00:09:04.615
"Clouds." (Laughter)

00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:07.522
He said, "All right.
What else do you see?"

00:09:07.522 --> 00:09:10.023
At that time, it was a plane passing by.

00:09:10.023 --> 00:09:12.050
I said, "All right, I see an airplane."

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.206
He said, "Exactly, and what's 
on that airplane?" "People."

00:09:16.206 --> 00:09:20.083
"Exactly. Now where's that plane
and those people going?"

00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:21.569
"I don't know. You know?

00:09:21.569 --> 00:09:24.816
Please let me know if you do.
Then let me get some lottery numbers."

00:09:26.236 --> 00:09:29.394
He said, "You're missing
the big picture, young blood.

00:09:29.394 --> 00:09:31.739
That plane with those people
is going somewhere,

00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:34.317
while we're here stuck.

00:09:34.317 --> 00:09:36.151
The big picture is this:

00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:38.519
That plane with those people
going somewhere,

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:42.970
that's life passing us by
while we behind these walls, stuck."

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.318
Ever since that day,

00:09:48.318 --> 00:09:52.497
that sparked something in my mind
and made me know I had to make a change.

00:09:52.497 --> 00:09:55.794
Growing up, I was always
a good, smart kid.

00:09:55.794 --> 00:10:00.743
Some people would say
I was a little too smart for my own good.

00:10:00.743 --> 00:10:06.290
I had dreams of becoming
an architect or an archaeologist.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.473
Currently, I'm working
at the Fortune Society,

00:10:08.473 --> 00:10:10.222
which is a reentry program,

00:10:10.222 --> 00:10:14.765
and I work with people as a case manager
that are at high risk for recidivism.

00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:17.171
So I connect them
with the services that they need

00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:19.200
once they're released from jail and prison

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.326
so they can make a positive transition
back into society.

00:10:22.326 --> 00:10:25.121
If I was to see my 15-year-old self today,

00:10:25.121 --> 00:10:28.092
I would sit down and talk to him
and try to educate him

00:10:28.092 --> 00:10:32.037
and I would let him know,
"Listen, this is me. I'm you.

00:10:32.037 --> 00:10:34.431
This is us. We are one.

00:10:34.431 --> 00:10:37.473
Everything that you're about to do,
I know what you're gonna do

00:10:37.473 --> 00:10:40.097
before you do it because I already did it,

00:10:40.097 --> 00:10:43.734
and I would encourage him
not to hang out with x, y and z people.

00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:46.540
I would tell him not to be
in such-and-such place.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.916
I would tell him,
keep your behind in school, man,

00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:50.836
because that's where you need to be,

00:10:50.836 --> 00:10:53.540
because that's what's going
to get you somewhere in life.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.703
This is the message
that we should be sharing

00:10:55.703 --> 00:10:57.576
with our young men and young women.

00:10:57.576 --> 00:11:01.504
We shouldn't be treating them as adults
and putting them in cultures of violence

00:11:01.504 --> 00:11:04.203
that are nearly impossible
for them to escape.

00:11:04.203 --> 00:11:06.268
Thank you.

00:11:06.268 --> 00:11:10.122
(Applause)
