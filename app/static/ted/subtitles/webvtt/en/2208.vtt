00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.635
I'm a toy developer.

00:00:06.845 --> 00:00:10.899
With a dream of creating new toys
that have never been seen before,

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.506
I began working at a toy company
nine years ago.

00:00:14.026 --> 00:00:16.062
When I first started working there,

00:00:16.062 --> 00:00:20.020
I proposed many new ideas
to my boss every day.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.838
However, my boss always asked

00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:25.442
if I had the data to prove it would sell,

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.875
and asked me to think of product
development after analyzing market data.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.289
Data, data, data.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.788
So I analyzed the market data
before thinking of a product.

00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:39.080
However, I was unable to think
of anything new at that moment.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.542
(Laughter)

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:42.591
My ideas were unoriginal.

00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:46.904
I wasn't getting any new ideas
and I grew tired of thinking.

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:51.585
It was so hard that I became this skinny.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:53.582
(Laughter)

00:00:53.582 --> 00:00:55.344
It's true.
(Applause)

00:00:56.224 --> 00:01:00.279
You've all probably had
similar experiences and felt this way too.

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:02.891
Your boss was being difficult.
The data was difficult.

00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:04.682
You become sick of thinking.

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:07.587
Now, I throw out the data.

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:10.596
It's my dream to create new toys.

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:12.824
And now, instead of data,

00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:17.012
I'm using a game called Shiritori
to come up with new ideas.

00:01:17.012 --> 00:01:20.580
I would like to introduce
this method today.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.701
What is Shiritori?

00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:25.166
Take apple, elephant 
and trumpet, for example.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.400
It's a game where 
you take turns saying words

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.962
that start with the last letter
of the previous word.

00:01:29.962 --> 00:01:31.864
It's the same in Japanese and English.

00:01:31.864 --> 00:01:34.158
You can play Shiritori as you like:

00:01:34.158 --> 00:01:37.396
"neko, kora, raibu, burashi," etc, etc.
[Cat, cola, concert, brush]

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:40.084
Many random words will come out.

00:01:40.084 --> 00:01:45.174
You force those words to connect to what
you want to think of and form ideas.

00:01:45.174 --> 00:01:48.777
In my case, for example,
since I want to think of toys,

00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:51.660
what could a toy cat be?

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.227
A cat that lands after doing
a somersault from a high place?

00:01:55.227 --> 00:01:57.353
How about a toy with cola?

00:01:57.353 --> 00:02:00.354
A toy gun where you shoot cola
and get someone soaking wet?

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:01.343
(Laughter)

00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:04.376
Ridiculous ideas are okay.
The key is to keep them flowing.

00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:09.732
The more ideas you produce, you're sure
to come up with some good ones, too.

00:02:09.732 --> 00:02:14.598
A brush, for example.
Can we make a toothbrush into a toy?

00:02:14.598 --> 00:02:18.464
We could combine
a toothbrush with a guitar and --

00:02:18.464 --> 00:02:20.609
(Music noises) --

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.765
you've got a toy you can play with
while brushing your teeth.

00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:25.531
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:29.484
Kids who don't like to brush
their teeth might begin to like it.

00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:32.706
Can we make a hat into a toy?

00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:36.757
How about something like a roulette game,
where you try the hat on one by one,

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:41.641
and then, when someone puts it on,
a scary alien breaks through the top

00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:43.635
screaming, "Ahh!"

00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:46.630
I wonder if there would be
a demand for this at parties?

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.873
Ideas that didn't come out while you stare
at the data will start to come out.

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:57.745
Actually, this bubble wrap,
which is used to pack fragile objects,

00:02:57.745 --> 00:03:02.551
combined with a toy,
made Mugen Pop Pop,

00:03:02.551 --> 00:03:05.823
a toy where you can pop
the bubbles as much as you like.

00:03:05.823 --> 00:03:08.013
It was a big hit when it reached stores.

00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:10.960
Data had nothing to do with its success.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.662
Although it's only popping bubbles,

00:03:13.662 --> 00:03:15.716
it's a great way to kill time,

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:17.770
so please pass this around

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.325
amongst yourselves today and play with it.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.486
(Applause)

00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:27.544
Anyway, you continue to come up with
useless ideas.

00:03:27.544 --> 00:03:29.894
Think up many trivial ideas, everyone.

00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:33.591
If you base your ideas on data analysis
and know what you're aiming for,

00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:36.060
you'll end up trying too hard,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.002
and you can't produce new ideas.

00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:40.235
Even if you know what your aim is,

00:03:40.235 --> 00:03:44.121
think of ideas as freely as if you were
throwing darts with your eyes closed.

00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:47.272
If you do this, you surely will hit
somewhere near the center.

00:03:47.272 --> 00:03:48.860
At least one will.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.907
That's the one you should choose.

00:03:50.907 --> 00:03:53.541
If you do so, that idea will be in demand

00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:56.325
and, moreover, it will be brand new.

00:03:56.325 --> 00:03:58.441
That is how I think of new ideas.

00:03:58.441 --> 00:04:01.633
It doesn't have to be Shiritori;
there are many different methods.

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:03.543
You just have to choose words at random.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:06.490
You can flip through a dictionary
and choose words at random.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.904
For example, you could look up two
random letters and gather the results

00:04:10.904 --> 00:04:14.552
or go to the store
and connect product names

00:04:14.552 --> 00:04:17.992
with what you want to think of.

00:04:17.992 --> 00:04:21.142
The point is to gather random words,

00:04:21.142 --> 00:04:24.487
not information from the category
you're thinking for.

00:04:24.487 --> 00:04:30.467
If you do this, the ingredients for
the association of ideas are collected

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:33.356
and form connections
that will produce many ideas.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:37.245
The greatest advantage to this method
is the continuous flow of images.

00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:40.218
Because you're thinking
of one word after another,

00:04:40.218 --> 00:04:42.884
the image of the previous word
is still with you.

00:04:42.884 --> 00:04:45.649
That image will automatically
be related with future words.

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:48.171
Unconsciously, a concert will
be connected to a brush

00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:50.360
and a roulette game
will be connected to a hat.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.740
You wouldn't even realize it.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.081
You can come up with ideas that
you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

00:04:55.081 --> 00:04:57.181
This method is, of course,
not just for toys.

00:04:57.181 --> 00:05:01.892
You can collect ideas for books, apps,
events, and many other projects.

00:05:01.892 --> 00:05:04.940
I hope you all try this method.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.089
There are futures that are born from data.

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:13.859
However, using this silly game
called Shiritori,

00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:16.959
I look forward to
the exciting future you will create,

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:20.490
a future you couldn't even imagine.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.891
Thank you very much.

00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:25.631
(Applause)
