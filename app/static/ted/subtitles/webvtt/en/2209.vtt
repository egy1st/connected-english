00:00:00.646 --> 00:00:03.964
My name is Harry Baker.
Harry Baker is my name.

00:00:03.964 --> 00:00:08.867
If your name was Harry Baker,
then our names would be the same.

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:10.307
(Laughter)

00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:12.494
It's a short introductory part.

00:00:12.954 --> 00:00:14.486
Yeah, I'm Harry.

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:17.063
I study maths. I write poetry.

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:21.266
So I thought I'd start
with a love poem about prime numbers.

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.915
(Laughter)

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:26.281
This is called "59."

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.171
I was going to call it
"Prime Time Loving."

00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:31.071
That reaction is why I didn't.

00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:32.560
(Laughter)

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.836
So, "59."

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:39.359
59 wakes up on the wrong 
side of the bed.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.910
Realizes all his hair is 
on one side of his head.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.797
Takes just under a minute to work out that
it’s because of the way that he slept.

00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:47.713
He finds some clothes and gets dressed.

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:50.539
He can’t help but look in the mirror
and be subtly impressed

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.372
How he looks rough around the edges
and yet casually messed.

00:00:53.372 --> 00:00:56.993
And as he glances out the window, he
sees the sight that he gets blessed with

00:00:56.993 --> 00:00:58.495
of 60 from across the street.

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:00.288
Now 60 was beautiful.

00:01:00.288 --> 00:01:03.316
With perfectly trimmed cuticles,
dressed in something suitable.

00:01:03.316 --> 00:01:04.753
Never rude or crude at all.

00:01:04.753 --> 00:01:08.036
Unimprovable, right on time as usual,
more on cue than a snooker ball

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:10.183
but liked to play it super cool.

00:01:10.183 --> 00:01:13.490
59 wanted to tell her
that he knew her favorite flower.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.162
He thought of her every second,
every minute, every hour.

00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:18.801
But he knew it wouldn’t work,
he’d never get the girl.

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:20.911
Because although she lived 
across the street

00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:22.451
they came from different worlds.

00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:24.881
While 59 admired 60’s
perfectly round figure,

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:29.597
60 thought 59 was odd.
(Laughter)

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:35.752
One of his favorite films
was "101 Dalmatians."

00:01:35.752 --> 00:01:38.754
She preferred the sequel.

00:01:38.754 --> 00:01:41.870
He romanticized the idea
they were star-crossed lovers.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.043
They could overcome the odds
and evens because they had each other.

00:01:45.043 --> 00:01:48.243
While she maintained the strict views
imposed on her by her mother

00:01:48.243 --> 00:01:50.040
That separate could not be equal.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.208
And though at the time he felt
stupid and dumb

00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:54.850
For trying to love a girl controlled
by her stupid mum,

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.239
He should have been comforted
by the simple sum.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.669
Take 59 away from 60,
and you’re left with the one.

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:02.197
Sure enough after two months
of moping around,

00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:04.649
61 days later, 61 was who he found,

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.871
He had lost his keys 
and his parents were out.

00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.993
So one day after school 
he went into a house

00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:11.506
As he noticed the slightly wonky
numbers on the door,

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.991
He wondered why he’d never
introduced himself before,

00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:16.119
As she let him in, his jaw 
dropped in awe.

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.308
61 was like 60, but a little bit more.
(Laughter)

00:02:19.308 --> 00:02:22.710
She had prettier eyes,
and an approachable smile,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.136
And like him, rough around
the edges, casual style,

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:27.512
And like him, everything
was in disorganized piles,

00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:30.345
And like him, her mum didn’t mind
if friends stayed a while.

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:32.440
Because she was like him, 
and he liked her.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.198
He reckoned she would like him
if she knew he was like her,

00:02:35.198 --> 00:02:38.076
And it was different this time.
I mean, this girl was wicked,

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:40.636
So he plucked up the courage
and asked for her digits.


00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:45.350
She said, "I'm 61."
He grinned, said, "I'm 59."

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.983
Today I’ve had a really nice time,

00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:49.556
So tomorrow if you wanted
you could come over to mine?

00:02:49.556 --> 00:02:50.419
She said, "Sure."

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.603
She loved talking to someone 
just as quirky,

00:02:52.603 --> 00:02:54.551
She agreed to this unofficial first date.

00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:56.711
In the end he was only
ready one minute early,

00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:59.435
But it didn’t matter because
she arrived one minute late.

00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:01.879
And from that moment on
there was nonstop chatter,

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.354
How they loved "X Factor,"
how they had two factors,

00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:08.454
How that did not matter,
distinctiveness made them better,

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:11.239
By the end of the night they knew
they were meant together.

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.213
And one day she was talking
about stuck-up 60,

00:03:14.213 --> 00:03:16.140
She noticed that 59 looked a bit shifty.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.837
He blushed, told her of his crush:

00:03:17.837 --> 00:03:20.604
“The best thing that never happened
because it led to us.”

00:03:20.604 --> 00:03:23.446
61 was clever, see,
not prone to jealousy,

00:03:23.446 --> 00:03:26.148
She looked him in the eyes
and told him quite tenderly,

00:03:26.148 --> 00:03:31.140
"You’re 59, I’m 61, together we combine
to become twice what 60 could ever be."

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.483
(Laughter)

00:03:34.483 --> 00:03:36.770
At this point 59 had tears in his eyes,

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.388
Was so glad to have
this one-of-a-kind girl in his life.

00:03:39.388 --> 00:03:41.588
He told her the very
definition of being prime

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:44.345
Was that with only one
and himself could his heart divide,

00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:46.769
And she was the one he wanted
to give his heart to,

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.098
She said she felt the same
and now she knew the films were half true.

00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:52.919
Because that wasn't real love,
that love was just a sample,

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.193
When it came to real love,
they were a prime example.

00:03:56.193 --> 00:03:57.888
Cheers.

00:03:57.888 --> 00:04:02.648
(Applause)

00:04:08.522 --> 00:04:10.334
That was the first poem that I wrote

00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:14.753
and it was for a prime number-themed 
poetry night -- (Laughter) --

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:17.973
which turned out to be
a prime number-themed poetry competition.

00:04:17.973 --> 00:04:21.200
And I became a prime number-themed
poetry competition winner,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.709
or as I like to call it,
a prime minister. (Laughter)

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:27.657
And this is how I discovered
these things called poetry slams,

00:04:27.657 --> 00:04:29.791
and if you don't know what 
a poetry slam is,

00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.485
it was a format come up with
in America 30 years ago

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:35.457
as a way of tricking people
into going to poetry events

00:04:35.457 --> 00:04:38.312
by putting an exciting word
like "slam" on the end.

00:04:38.312 --> 00:04:39.706
(Laughter)

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:42.608
And each performer got
three minutes to perform

00:04:42.608 --> 00:04:45.403
and then random audience members
would hold up scorecards,

00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:47.530
and they would end up
with a numerical score,

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.738
and what this meant is,

00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:51.943
it kind of broke down the barrier
between performer and audience

00:04:51.943 --> 00:04:54.653
and encouraged the kind
of connection with the listener.

00:04:54.653 --> 00:04:56.681
And what it also means is you can win.

00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:01.021
And if you win a poetry slam,
you can call yourself a slam champion

00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:03.412
and pretend you're a wrestler,

00:05:03.412 --> 00:05:07.476
and if you lose a poetry slam you can say,
"Oh, what? Poetry's a subjective art form,

00:05:07.476 --> 00:05:09.774
you can't put numbers on such things."

00:05:09.774 --> 00:05:11.467
(Laughter)

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:13.814
But I loved it, and I
got involved in these slams,

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:16.113
and I became the U.K. slam champion

00:05:16.113 --> 00:05:19.178
and got invited to
the Poetry World Cup in Paris,

00:05:19.178 --> 00:05:20.617
which was unbelievable.

00:05:20.617 --> 00:05:24.133
It was people from all around the world
speaking in their native languages

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:26.585
to be judged by five French strangers.

00:05:26.585 --> 00:05:28.744
(Laughter)

00:05:28.744 --> 00:05:32.715
And somehow, I won, which was great,

00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:35.849
and I've been able
to travel the world since doing it,

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.892
but it also means that this next piece

00:05:37.892 --> 00:05:41.375
is technically the best poem in the world.

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:45.369
(Laughter)

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:46.785
So...

00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:51.638
(Applause)

00:05:51.638 --> 00:05:54.633
According to five French strangers.

00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:58.557
So this is "Paper People."

00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:00.636
I like people.

00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:02.992
I'd like some paper people.

00:06:02.992 --> 00:06:06.173
They’d be purple paper people.
Maybe pop-up purple paper people.

00:06:06.173 --> 00:06:08.913
Proper pop-up purple paper people.

00:06:08.913 --> 00:06:11.839
"How do you prop up
pop-up purple paper people?"

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.253
I hear you cry. Well I ...

00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:17.011
I’d probably prop up proper
pop-up purple paper people

00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:20.662
with a proper pop-up
purple people paperclip,

00:06:20.662 --> 00:06:23.399
but I’d pre-prepare appropriate
adhesives as alternatives,

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.171
a cheeky pack of Blu Tack
just in case the paper slipped.

00:06:26.171 --> 00:06:28.254
Because I could build a pop-up metropolis.

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:31.135
but I wouldn’t wanna deal with all the
paper people politics.

00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:33.496
paper politicians with their
paper-thin policies,

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:35.720
broken promises
without appropriate apologies.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.575
There’d be a little paper me.
And a little paper you.

00:06:39.575 --> 00:06:42.799
And we could watch paper TV
and it would all be pay-per-view.

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:44.273
(Laughter)

00:06:44.273 --> 00:06:47.539
We’d see the poppy paper rappers
rap about their paper package

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:52.509
or watch paper people carriers
get stuck in paper traffic on the A4.

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:55.248
(Laughter) Paper.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:07:00.402
There’d be a paper princess Kate
but we’d all stare at paper Pippa,

00:07:00.402 --> 00:07:03.385
and then we’d all live in fear of
killer Jack the Paper-Ripper,

00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:06.439
because the paper propaganda
propagates the people's prejudices,

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:09.095
papers printing pictures of the
photogenic terrorists.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.615
A little paper me.
And a little paper you.

00:07:11.615 --> 00:07:14.288
And in a pop-up population
people’s problems pop up too.

00:07:14.288 --> 00:07:17.295
There’d be a pompous paper parliament
who remained out of touch,

00:07:17.295 --> 00:07:20.282
and who ignored the people's protests
about all the paper cuts,

00:07:20.282 --> 00:07:23.524
then the peaceful paper protests
would get blown to paper pieces,

00:07:23.524 --> 00:07:26.064
by the confetti cannons
manned by pre-emptive police.

00:07:26.064 --> 00:07:29.639
And yes there’d still be paper money,
so there’d still be paper greed,

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.358
and the paper piggy bankers
pocketing more than they need,

00:07:32.358 --> 00:07:35.106
purchasing the potpourri
to pepper their paper properties,

00:07:35.106 --> 00:07:37.776
others live in poverty
and ain’t acknowledged properly.

00:07:37.776 --> 00:07:40.248
A proper poor economy
where so many are proper poor,

00:07:40.248 --> 00:07:43.153
but while their needs are ignored
the money goes to big wars.

00:07:43.153 --> 00:07:45.245
Origami armies
unfold plans for paper planes

00:07:45.245 --> 00:07:47.605
and we remain imprisoned
in our own paper chains,

00:07:47.605 --> 00:07:51.264
but the greater shame
is that it always seems to stay the same,

00:07:51.264 --> 00:07:54.172
what changes is who’s in power
choosing how to lay the blame,

00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:57.611
they’re naming names,
forgetting these are names of people,

00:07:57.611 --> 00:08:00.697
because in the end
it all comes down to people.

00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:02.144
I like people.

00:08:02.144 --> 00:08:03.965
'Cause even when the situation’s dire,

00:08:03.965 --> 00:08:06.224
it is only ever people
who are able to inspire,

00:08:06.224 --> 00:08:09.459
and on paper,
it’s hard to see how we all cope.

00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:12.120
But in the bottom of Pandora’s box
there’s still hope,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.953
and I still hope
'cause I believe in people.

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:17.275
People like my grandparents.

00:08:17.275 --> 00:08:19.090
Who every single day since I was born,

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.305
have taken time out of their morning
to pray for me.

00:08:22.305 --> 00:08:25.719
That’s 7892 days straight
of someone checking I’m okay,

00:08:25.719 --> 00:08:27.713
and that’s amazing.

00:08:27.713 --> 00:08:30.417
People like my aunt who puts on
plays with prisoners.

00:08:30.417 --> 00:08:32.601
People who are capable
of genuine forgiveness.

00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:34.520
People like the persecuted Palestinians.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.174
People who go out of their way
to make your life better,

00:08:37.174 --> 00:08:38.868
and expect nothing in return.

00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:41.043
You see, people have potential
to be powerful.

00:08:41.043 --> 00:08:44.198
Just because the people in power
tend to pretend to be victims

00:08:44.198 --> 00:08:46.250
we don’t need to succumb to that system.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.595
And a paper population is no different.

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:52.313
There’s a little paper me.
And a little paper you.

00:08:52.313 --> 00:08:54.941
And in a pop-up population
people's problems pop up too,

00:08:54.941 --> 00:08:58.324
but even if the whole world fell apart
then we’d still make it through.

00:08:58.324 --> 00:09:00.785
Because we’re people.

00:09:00.785 --> 00:09:03.247
Thank you.

00:09:03.247 --> 00:09:07.496
(Applause)

00:09:18.688 --> 00:09:21.543
Thank you very much.
I've just got time for one more.

00:09:21.543 --> 00:09:25.038
For me, poetry has been the ultimate way
of ideas without frontiers.

00:09:25.038 --> 00:09:26.040
When I first started,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.145
the people who inspired me
were the ones with the amazing stories,

00:09:29.145 --> 00:09:33.281
and I thought, as an 18-year-old
with a happy life, it was too normal,

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:37.007
but I could create these worlds
where I could talk about my experiences

00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:38.331
and dreams and beliefs.

00:09:38.331 --> 00:09:41.326
So it's amazing to be here
in front of you today.

00:09:41.326 --> 00:09:42.742
Thank you for being here.

00:09:42.742 --> 00:09:44.019
If you weren't here,

00:09:44.019 --> 00:09:46.759
it would be pretty much
like the sound check yesterday.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:48.826
(Laughter)

00:09:48.826 --> 00:09:51.403
And this is more fun.

00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:53.563
So this last one is called
"The Sunshine Kid."

00:09:53.563 --> 00:09:56.697
Thank you very much for listening.

00:09:56.697 --> 00:10:00.087
Old man sunshine was proud of his sun,

00:10:00.087 --> 00:10:02.553
And it brightened his day
to see his little boy run,

00:10:02.553 --> 00:10:05.219
Not because of what he’d done,
nor the problems overcome,

00:10:05.219 --> 00:10:08.134
But that despite that his disposition
remained a sunny one.

00:10:08.134 --> 00:10:10.730
It hadn’t always been like this.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.461
There’d been times when he’d tried
to hide his brightness,

00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:15.597
You see, every star
hits periods of hardship,

00:10:15.597 --> 00:10:18.801
It takes a brighter light
to inspire them through the darkness.

00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:21.155
If we go back to when
he was born in a nebula,

00:10:21.155 --> 00:10:23.474
We know that he never
was thought of as regular,

00:10:23.474 --> 00:10:25.210
Because he had a flair about him,

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:26.765
To say the Midas touch is wrong

00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:29.203
But all he went near
seemed to turn a little bronze,

00:10:29.203 --> 00:10:31.847
Yes this sun was loved
by some more than others,

00:10:31.847 --> 00:10:34.579
It was a case of Joseph
and his dreamcoat and his brothers

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:37.516
Because standing out from the crowd
had its pros and its cons,

00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:40.106
And jealousy created enemies
in those he outshone

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:41.417
Such as the Shadow People.

00:10:41.417 --> 00:10:43.818
Now the Shadow People
didn’t like the Sunshine Kid,

00:10:43.818 --> 00:10:46.585
Because he showed up the dark things
the Shadow People did,

00:10:46.585 --> 00:10:49.735
And when he shone he showed
the places where the Shadow People hid,

00:10:49.735 --> 00:10:52.353
So the Shadow People had
an evil plan to get rid of him,

00:10:52.353 --> 00:10:54.707
First up -- they made fun of his sunspots,

00:10:54.707 --> 00:10:57.525
Shooting his dreams from the sky,
their words were gunshots,

00:10:57.525 --> 00:11:00.103
Designed to remind him
he wasn’t very cool

00:11:00.103 --> 00:11:02.587
And he didn’t fit in with any
popular kids at school.

00:11:02.587 --> 00:11:06.152
They said his head was up in space
and they would bring him down to Earth,

00:11:06.152 --> 00:11:09.143
Essentially he came from nothing
and that is what he was worth,

00:11:09.143 --> 00:11:11.277
He’d never get to go
to university to learn,

00:11:11.277 --> 00:11:14.046
Only degrees he’d ever show
would be the first degree burns

00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:15.754
From those that came too close,

00:11:15.754 --> 00:11:17.342
they told him he was too bright,

00:11:17.342 --> 00:11:19.519
That’s why no one ever
looked him in the eyes,

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:20.991
His judgment became clouded

00:11:20.991 --> 00:11:22.915
So did the sky,
With evaporated tears

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:24.158
as the sun started to cry.

00:11:24.158 --> 00:11:29.405
Because the sunshine kid was bright,
with a warm personality,

00:11:29.405 --> 00:11:31.332
And inside he burned savagely

00:11:31.332 --> 00:11:33.701
Hurt by the words and curses
of the shadowy folk

00:11:33.701 --> 00:11:36.278
who spoke holes in his soul
and left cavities,

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:40.016
And as his heart hardened,
his spark darkened,

00:11:40.016 --> 00:11:42.600
Every time they called him names
it cooled his flames,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.277
He thought they might like him
if he kept his light dim

00:11:45.277 --> 00:11:48.468
But they were busy telling lightning
she had terrible aim,

00:11:48.468 --> 00:11:51.254
He couldn’t quite get to grips
with what they said,

00:11:51.254 --> 00:11:54.096
So he let his light be eclipsed
by what they said,

00:11:54.096 --> 00:11:56.235
He fell into a Lone Star State like Texas,

00:11:56.235 --> 00:11:58.661
And felt like he’d been punched
in his solar plexus.

00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:02.718
But that’s when
Little Miss Sunshine came along

00:12:02.718 --> 00:12:05.650
Singing her favorite song
about how we’re made to be strong,

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.156
And you don’t have to be wrong to belong,
Just be true to who you are,

00:12:09.156 --> 00:12:11.362
because we are all stars at heart.

00:12:11.362 --> 00:12:15.193
Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff,

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.458
The kind of girl when you looked at her

00:12:17.458 --> 00:12:19.174
you forgot stuff,

00:12:19.174 --> 00:12:21.164
But for him, there was no forgetting her,

00:12:21.164 --> 00:12:23.645
The minute he saw her
her image burned in his retina,

00:12:23.645 --> 00:12:25.957
She was out of this world,
and she accepted him,

00:12:25.957 --> 00:12:29.220
Something about this girl meant he knew
whenever she was next to him,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.121
Things weren’t as dark as they seemed,
and he dared to dream,

00:12:32.121 --> 00:12:35.055
Shadows were nowhere to be seen;
when she was there he beamed,

00:12:35.055 --> 00:12:37.528
His eyes would light up
in ways that can’t be faked,

00:12:37.528 --> 00:12:40.667
When she grinned her rays erased
the razor-tipped words of hate,

00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:43.865
They gave each other nicknames,
they were "cool star" and "fun sun,"

00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:46.615
And gradually the shadowy
damage became undone,

00:12:46.615 --> 00:12:50.552
She was one in a septillion,
and she was brilliant,

00:12:50.552 --> 00:12:53.371
Could turn the coldest blooded
reptilians vermillion,

00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:56.038
Loved by billions,
from Chileans to Brazilians,

00:12:56.038 --> 00:12:58.730
And taught the Sunshine Kid
the meaning of resilience.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.562
She said: “All the darkness in the world

00:13:01.562 --> 00:13:04.836
cannot put out the light
from a single candle

00:13:04.836 --> 00:13:06.946
So how the hell can they
handle your light?

00:13:06.946 --> 00:13:09.875
Only you can choose to dim it,
and the sky is the limit,

00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:11.692
so silence the critics by burning.”

00:13:11.692 --> 00:13:14.861
And if eyes are windows to the soul
then she drew back the curtains

00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:16.841
And let the sun shine
through the hurting.

00:13:16.841 --> 00:13:19.429
In a universe of adversity
these stars stuck together,

00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:22.335
And though days became nights
the memories would last forever,

00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:25.031
Whether the weatherman
said it or not, it would be fine,

00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:27.668
'Cause even behind the clouds
the kid could still shine.

00:13:27.668 --> 00:13:30.531
Yes, the Sunshine Kid was bright,
with a warm personality,

00:13:30.531 --> 00:13:32.188
And inside he burned savagely,

00:13:32.188 --> 00:13:35.532
Fueled by the fire
inspired across galaxies

00:13:35.532 --> 00:13:38.318
By the girl who showed him belief.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:41.058
Thank you very much.

00:13:41.058 --> 00:13:47.722
(Applause)
