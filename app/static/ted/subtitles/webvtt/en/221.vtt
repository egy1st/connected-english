WEBVTT

00:00:00.484 --> 00:00:01.635
I'm a historian.

00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:05.752
Steve told us about the future
of little technology;

00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:09.813
I'm going to show you some
of the past of big technology.

00:00:09.837 --> 00:00:15.273
This was a project to build a 4,000-ton
nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:17.845
and go to Saturn and Jupiter.

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.540
This took place in my childhood, 1957-65.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:23.843
It was deeply classified.

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:27.939
I'm going to show you some stuff
that not only has not been declassified,

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:30.469
but has now been reclassified.

00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:34.185
(Laughter)

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:36.253
If all goes well, next year I'll be back,

00:00:36.277 --> 00:00:39.408
and I'll have a lot more to show you,
and if all doesn't go well,

00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:41.727
I'll be in jail, like Wen Ho Lee.

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:45.497
(Laughter)

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:50.269
So, this ship was basically
the size of the Marriott Hotel,

00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:52.576
a little taller and a little bigger.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.259
And one of the people
who worked on it at the beginning

00:00:55.283 --> 00:00:57.351
was my father, Freeman,
there in the middle.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:00.257
That's me and my sister, Esther,
who's a frequent TEDster.

00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:03.443
I didn't like nuclear
bomb-propelled spaceships.

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:06.732
I mean, I thought it was a great idea,
but I started building kayaks.

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:07.920
So we had a few kayaks.

00:01:07.944 --> 00:01:10.659
Just so you know
that I am not Dr. Strangelove.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.349
But all the time I was out there
doing these strange kayak voyages

00:01:15.373 --> 00:01:18.243
in odd, beautiful parts of this planet,

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:21.576
I always thought in the back
of my mind about Project Orion,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.576
and how my father and his friends
were going to build these big ships.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.643
They were actually going to go --

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:30.704
Ted Taylor, who led the project,
was going to take his children.

00:01:30.728 --> 00:01:32.855
My father was not going
to take his children,

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:36.518
that was one of the reasons we sort
of had a falling out for a few years.

00:01:36.542 --> 00:01:40.252
(Laughter)

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:42.776
The project began in '57
at General Atomics there,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.742
that's right on the coast at La Jolla.

00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:47.839
Look at that central building
right in the middle of the picture.

00:01:47.863 --> 00:01:51.199
That's the 130-foot diameter library.

00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:54.176
That is exactly the size
of the base of the spaceship.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.622
So put that library
at the bottom of that ship --

00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:58.615
that's how big the thing was going to be.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.685
It would take two or three thousand bombs.

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.686
The people who worked on it
were a lot of the Los Alamos people

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.435
who had done the hydrogen bomb work.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.586
It was the first project funded by ARPA.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.473
That's the contract where ARPA
gave the first million dollars

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:11.744
to get this thing started.

00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:15.531
"Spaceship project officially begun.
Job waiting for you. Dyson."

00:02:15.555 --> 00:02:16.976
That's July '58.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.234
Two days later, the space traveler's
manifesto explaining why --

00:02:21.258 --> 00:02:24.136
just like we heard yesterday --
why we need to go into space:

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.327
"... trips to satellites
of the outer planets.

00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:28.071
August 20, 1958."

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:32.452
These are the statistics of what would be
the good places to go and stop.

00:02:32.476 --> 00:02:33.965
Some of the sizes of the ships,

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.171
ranging all the way up
to ship mass of 8 million tons.

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:39.628
So that was the outer extreme.

00:02:39.652 --> 00:02:43.513
Here was version two: 2,000 bombs.

00:02:43.537 --> 00:02:48.830
These are five-kiloton yield bombs,
about the size of small Volkswagens;

00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:51.313
it would take 800 to get into orbit.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:55.757
Here we see a 10,000-ton ship
will deliver 1,300 tons

00:02:55.781 --> 00:02:58.595
to Saturn and back --
essentially, a five-year trip.

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:03.500
Possible departure dates:
October 1960 to February 1967.

00:03:03.524 --> 00:03:06.143
These are trajectories going to Mars.

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:08.285
All this was done by hand,
with slide rules.

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:09.873
The little Orion ship,

00:03:09.897 --> 00:03:12.749
and what it would take
to do what Orion does with chemicals:

00:03:12.773 --> 00:03:15.310
you have a ship the size
of the Empire State Building.

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:17.814
NASA had no interest;
they tried to kill the project.

00:03:17.838 --> 00:03:20.037
The people who supported it
were the Air Force,

00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:21.735
which meant that it was all secret.

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.439
And that's why when you get something
declassified, that's what it looks like.

00:03:25.463 --> 00:03:27.979
Military weapon versions
that carried hydrogen bombs

00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:29.684
that could destroy half the planet.

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:33.532
There's another version there that sends
retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.

00:03:33.556 --> 00:03:35.088
This is the really secret stuff:

00:03:35.112 --> 00:03:37.224
how to get directed energy explosions.

00:03:37.248 --> 00:03:39.797
So you're sending the energy
of a nuclear explosion --

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:43.183
not like just a stick of dynamite,
but you're directing it at the ship.

00:03:43.207 --> 00:03:45.471
And this is still a very active subject.

00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:46.701
It's quite dangerous,

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:49.678
but I believe it's better to have
dangerous things in the open

00:03:49.702 --> 00:03:51.758
than think you're going
to keep them secret.

00:03:51.782 --> 00:03:53.838
This is what happened
at 600 microseconds.

00:03:53.862 --> 00:03:56.637
The Air Force started
to build smaller models

00:03:56.661 --> 00:03:58.355
and actually started doing this.

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.102
The guys in La Jolla said,
"We've got to get started now."

00:04:01.126 --> 00:04:03.526
They built a high-explosive
propelled model.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.272
These are stills from
film footage that was saved

00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:09.851
by someone who was supposed
to destroy it but didn't,

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.313
and kept it in their basement
for the last 40 years.

00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:14.253
So, these are three-pound charges of C4;

00:04:14.277 --> 00:04:16.950
that's about 10 times
what the guy had in his shoes.

00:04:16.974 --> 00:04:18.154
(Laughter)

00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:19.600
This is Ed Day putting --

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:22.873
So each of these coffee cans
has three pounds of C4 in it.

00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:27.033
They're building a system that ejects
these at quarter-second intervals.

00:04:27.057 --> 00:04:30.335
That's my dad in the sport coat there,
holding the briefcase.

00:04:30.359 --> 00:04:32.487
So, they had a lot of fun doing this.

00:04:32.511 --> 00:04:33.996
But no children were allowed;

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.623
my dad could tell me he was building
a spaceship and going to go to Saturn,

00:04:37.647 --> 00:04:39.765
but he could not say
anything more about it.

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.397
So all my life I have wanted
to find this stuff out,

00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:45.373
and spent the last four years
tracking these old guys down.

00:04:45.397 --> 00:04:46.924
These are stills from the video.

00:04:46.948 --> 00:04:49.727
Jeff Bezos kindly, yesterday,
said he'll put this video up

00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:52.143
on the Amazon site --
some little clip of it.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.175
(Applause)

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.456
So, thanks to him.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.076
They got quite serious
about the engineering of this.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.121
The size of that mass, for us,

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:03.073
is really large technology in a way
we're never going to go back to.

00:05:03.097 --> 00:05:04.851
If you saw the 1959 --

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:07.735
this is what it would feel
like in the passenger compartment;

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.132
that's acceleration profile.

00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:10.164
(Laughter)

00:05:10.188 --> 00:05:14.041
And pulse-system yield:
we're looking at 20-kiloton yield

00:05:14.065 --> 00:05:16.376
for an effective thrust
of 10 million newtons.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.037
Well, here we have a little problem,
the radiation doses at the crew station:

00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:22.808
700 rads per shot.

00:05:22.832 --> 00:05:24.539
(Laughter)

00:05:24.563 --> 00:05:26.316
Fission yields during development:

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.646
they were hoping to get
clean bombs; they didn't.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.926
Eyeburn: this is what happens
to the people in Miami who are looking up.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.374
(Laughter)

00:05:35.398 --> 00:05:38.953
Personnel compartment noise: that's
not too bad; it's very low frequencies,

00:05:38.977 --> 00:05:40.795
it's basically like these sub-woofers.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.453
And now we have ground-hazard assessments
when you have a blow-up on the pad.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:47.405
Finally, at the very end in 1964,
NASA steps in and says,

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:50.998
"OK, we'll support a feasibility study
for a small version

00:05:51.022 --> 00:05:55.122
that could be launched with Saturn Vs
in sections and pieced together."

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.171
So this is what NASA did,

00:05:57.195 --> 00:06:02.146
getting an eight-man version
that would go to Mars.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.366
They liked it because the guys could
kind of live there and be like,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.016
"It's like living in a submarine."

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.302
This is crew compartment.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.709
It switches, so what's
upside down is right side up

00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:12.596
when you go to artificial gravity mode.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.682
The scientists were still
going to go along;

00:06:14.706 --> 00:06:17.231
they would take seven astronauts
and seven scientists.

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:19.407
This is a 20-man version
for going to Jupiter:

00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:21.203
bunks, storm cellars, exercise room.

00:06:21.227 --> 00:06:23.874
You know, it was going
to be a nice, long trip.

00:06:23.898 --> 00:06:28.087
The Air Force version:
here we have a military version.

00:06:28.111 --> 00:06:30.701
This is the kind of stuff
that's not been declassified,

00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:33.503
just that people managed to sneak
home and after, you know,

00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:36.106
on their deathbed,
basically, gave me that.

00:06:37.074 --> 00:06:38.572
The sort of artist conceptions.

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:40.778
These are basically
PowerPoint presentations

00:06:40.802 --> 00:06:42.863
given to the Air Force 40 years ago.

00:06:42.887 --> 00:06:46.585
Look at the little guys there
outside the vehicle.

00:06:47.552 --> 00:06:50.520
And one part of NASA was interested in it,

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:53.507
but the headquarters in NASA,
they killed the project.

00:06:54.668 --> 00:06:57.050
So finally, at the end,

00:06:57.074 --> 00:07:02.291
we can see the thing followed
its sort of design path right up to 1965,

00:07:02.315 --> 00:07:04.266
and then all those paths came to a halt.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.751
Results: none.

00:07:05.775 --> 00:07:07.779
This project is hereby terminated.

00:07:07.803 --> 00:07:09.681
So that's the end.

00:07:09.705 --> 00:07:11.306
All I can say in closing is:

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.633
we heard yesterday that one of the 10
bad things that could happen to us

00:07:15.657 --> 00:07:18.247
is an asteroid with our name on it.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.660
And one of the bad things
that could happen to NASA

00:07:20.684 --> 00:07:23.799
is if that asteroid shows up
with our name on it nine months out,

00:07:23.823 --> 00:07:25.418
and everybody says,

00:07:25.442 --> 00:07:26.995
"Well, what are we going to do?"

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:29.962
And Orion is really one
of the only, if not the only,

00:07:29.986 --> 00:07:34.067
off-the-shelf technologies
that could do something.

00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:35.942
(Laughter)

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:38.600
So I'm going to tell you
the good news and the bad news.

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:44.375
The good news is that NASA has a small,
secret contingency-plan division

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:48.938
that is looking at this, trying
to keep knowledge of Orion preserved

00:07:48.962 --> 00:07:51.010
in the event of such a misfortune.

00:07:51.034 --> 00:07:54.042
Maybe keep a few little
bombs of plutonium on the side.

00:07:54.066 --> 00:07:55.217
That's the good news.

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:57.868
The bad news is, when I got
in contact with these people

00:07:57.892 --> 00:08:00.979
to try and get some documents
from them, they went crazy

00:08:01.003 --> 00:08:03.350
because I had all this stuff
that they don't have,

00:08:03.374 --> 00:08:08.419
and NASA purchased 1,759 pages
of this stuff from me.

00:08:08.443 --> 00:08:11.126
So that's the state we're at;
it's not very good.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.412
(Laughter)

00:08:12.436 --> 00:08:14.436
(Applause)
