WEBVTT

00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.519
I have a confession to make.

00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:03.309
I'm a business professor

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:05.839
whose ambition has been
to help people learn to lead.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.280
But recently, I've discovered

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.239
that what many of us
think of as great leadership

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.519
does not work when it comes
to leading innovation.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:14.920
I'm an ethnographer.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.640
I use the methods of anthropology

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.220
to understand the questions
in which I'm interested.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.380
So along with three co-conspirators,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.200
I spent nearly a decade observing
up close and personal

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.679
exceptional leaders of innovation.

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.880
We studied 16 men and women,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.439
located in seven countries
across the globe,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.920
working in 12 different industries.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.920
In total, we spent hundreds
of hours on the ground,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.200
on-site, watching these leaders in action.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.559
We ended up with pages and pages
and pages of field notes

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.920
that we analyzed and looked
for patterns in what our leaders did.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.979
The bottom line?

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.140
If we want to build organizations
that can innovate time and again,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.959
we must unlearn our conventional
notions of leadership.

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.560
Leading innovation is not
about creating a vision,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.760
and inspiring others to execute it.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.718
But what do we mean by innovation?

00:01:04.718 --> 00:01:08.079
An innovation is anything
that is both new and useful.

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:09.840
It can be a product or service.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.519
It can be a process
or a way of organizing.

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:15.359
It can be incremental,
or it can be breakthrough.

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.280
We have a pretty inclusive definition.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.879
How many of you recognize this man?

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.560
Put your hands up.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.840
Keep your hands up,
if you know who this is.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.599
How about these familiar faces?

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:34.680
(Laughter)

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.840
From your show of hands,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.280
it looks like many of you
have seen a Pixar movie,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.239
but very few of you recognized Ed Catmull,

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:43.879
the founder and CEO of Pixar --

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:46.799
one of the companies
I had the privilege of studying.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.479
My first visit to Pixar was in 2005,

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.400
when they were working on "Ratatouille,"

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.520
that provocative movie about
a rat becoming a master chef.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.439
Computer-generated movies
are really mainstream today,

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.120
but it took Ed and his
colleagues nearly 20 years

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.960
to create the first
full-length C.G. movie.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.240
In the 20 years hence,
they've produced 14 movies.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.000
I was recently at Pixar,
and I'm here to tell you

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.069
that number 15 is sure to be a winner.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.280
When many of us think
about innovation, though,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.919
we think about an Einstein
having an 'Aha!' moment.

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.280
But we all know that's a myth.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.240
Innovation is not about solo genius,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.479
it's about collective genius.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.159
Let's think for a minute about
what it takes to make a Pixar movie:

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.680
No solo genius, no flash of inspiration
produces one of those movies.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.080
On the contrary, it takes about
250 people four to five years,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.639
to make one of those movies.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.319
To help us understand the process,

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.960
an individual in the studio
drew a version of this picture.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.469
He did so reluctantly,

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.840
because it suggested that the process 
was a neat series of steps

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.130
done by discrete groups.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.990
Even with all those arrows,
he thought it failed to really tell you

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.840
just how iterative, interrelated
and, frankly, messy their process was.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.730
Throughout the making of a movie
at Pixar, the story evolves.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.520
So think about it.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.280
Some shots go through quickly.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.560
They don't all go through in order.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.199
It depends on how vexing
the challenges are

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.520
that they come up with when they
are working on a particular scene.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.919
So if you think about that scene in "Up"

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.120
where the boy hands the piece
of chocolate to the bird,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.259
that 10 seconds took one animator
almost six months to perfect.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.000
The other thing about a Pixar movie

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.400
is that no part of the movie
is considered finished

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.319
until the entire movie wraps.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.759
Partway through one production,
an animator drew a character

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:52.760
with an arched eyebrow that
suggested a mischievous side.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.770
When the director saw that
drawing, he thought it was great.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.199
It was beautiful, but he said,

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.020
"You've got to lose it;
it doesn't fit the character."

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.480
Two weeks later, the director
came back and said,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.560
"Let's put in those few seconds of film."

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.600
Because that animator
was allowed to share

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.800
what we referred to
as his slice of genius,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.120
he was able to help that director
reconceive the character

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.759
in a subtle but important way
that really improved the story.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.399
What we know is, at the heart
of innovation is a paradox.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:27.079
You have to unleash the talents
and passions of many people

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:31.809
and you have to harness them
into a work that is actually useful.

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:34.049
Innovation is a journey.

00:04:34.049 --> 00:04:36.879
It's a type of collaborative
problem solving,

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.639
usually among people
who have different expertise

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.759
and different points of view.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.319
Innovations rarely get created full-blown.

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.449
As many of you know,

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.199
they're the result,
usually, of trial and error.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.399
Lots of false starts,
missteps and mistakes.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:56.199
Innovative work can be
very exhilarating,

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.730
but it also can be
really downright scary.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.079
So when we look at why it is
that Pixar is able to do what it does,

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:11.839
we have to ask ourselves,
what's going on here?

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:14.800
For sure, history
and certainly Hollywood,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.930
is full of star-studded teams
that have failed.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.790
Most of those failures are attributed

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.879
to too many stars or too many
cooks, if you will, in the kitchen.

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.519
So why is it that Pixar,
with all of its cooks,

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:33.360
is able to be so successful
time and time again?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.439
When we studied
an Islamic Bank in Dubai,

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:41.000
or a luxury brand in Korea,
or a social enterprise in Africa,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.079
we found that innovative organizations

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:45.879
are communities that
have three capabilities:

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:50.959
creative abrasion, creative
agility and creative resolution.

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:55.960
Creative abrasion is about being able
to create a marketplace of ideas

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.160
through debate and discourse.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.079
In innovative organizations,
they amplify differences,

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:02.319
they don't minimize them.

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.360
Creative abrasion is not
about brainstorming,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.480
where people suspend their judgment.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.439
No, they know how to have very
heated but constructive arguments

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.600
to create a portfolio of alternatives.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.879
Individuals in innovative organizations

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.169
learn how to inquire, they learn how
to actively listen, but guess what?

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.959
They also learn how to
advocate for their point of view.

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:27.879
They understand that
innovation rarely happens

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:30.680
unless you have both
diversity and conflict.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.760
Creative agility is about being able
to test and refine that portfolio of ideas

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.120
through quick pursuit,
reflection and adjustment.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.959
It's about discovery-driven learning

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:45.199
where you act, as opposed to plan,
your way to the future.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.680
It's about design thinking where
you have that interesting combination

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.399
of the scientific method
and the artistic process.

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:56.879
It's about running a series of
experiments, and not a series of pilots.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:58.760
Experiments are usually about learning.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.310
When you get a negative outcome,

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.472
you're still really learning something
that you need to know.

00:07:03.472 --> 00:07:05.959
Pilots are often about being right.

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:10.319
When they don't work,
someone or something is to blame.

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:13.279
The final capability
is creative resolution.

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:14.990
This is about doing decision making

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.519
in a way that you can actually combine
even opposing ideas

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:21.040
to reconfigure them in new combinations

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.319
to produce a solution
that is new and useful.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.120
When you look at innovative organizations,
they never go along to get along.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.199
They don't compromise.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:33.639
They don't let one group
or one individual dominate,

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:38.000
even if it's the boss,
even if it's the expert.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.839
Instead, they have developed

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:43.399
a rather patient and more inclusive
decision making process

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:47.079
that allows for both/and
solutions to arise

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:49.879
and not simply either/or solutions.

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:53.879
These three capabilities are why we see

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:58.240
that Pixar is able to do what it does.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.209
Let me give you another example,

00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:02.839
and that example is the
infrastructure group of Google.

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:05.519
The infrastructure group
of Google is the group

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:09.569
that has to keep the website
up and running 24/7.

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:13.439
So when Google was about
to introduce Gmail and YouTube,

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:16.759
they knew that their data storage
system wasn't adequate.

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:20.919
The head of the engineering group
and the infrastructure group at that time

00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:23.480
was a man named Bill Coughran.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.240
Bill and his leadership team,
who he referred to as his brain trust,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.120
had to figure out what to do
about this situation.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.960
They thought about it for a while.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.440
Instead of creating a group
to tackle this task,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.720
they decided to allow groups
to emerge spontaneously

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.159
around different alternatives.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.000
Two groups coalesced.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.159
One became known as Big Table,

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:51.679
the other became known
as Build It From Scratch.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:54.600
Big Table proposed that they
build on the current system.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.960
Build It From Scratch proposed
that it was time for a whole new system.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.759
Separately, these two teams
were allowed to work full-time

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:04.799
on their particular approach.

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:07.919
In engineering reviews,
Bill described his role as,

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:12.879
"Injecting honesty into
the process by driving debate."

00:09:12.879 --> 00:09:16.879
Early on, the teams were encouraged
to build prototypes so that they could

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:20.320
"bump them up against reality
and discover for themselves

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.120
the strengths and weaknesses
of their particular approach."

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.140
When Build It From Scratch shared
their prototype with the group

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.060
whose beepers would have
to go off in the middle of the night

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.270
if something went wrong
with the website,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:36.120
they heard loud and clear about the
limitations of their particular design.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.039
As the need for a solution
became more urgent

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:42.320
and as the data, or the
evidence, began to come in,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.600
it became pretty clear
that the Big Table solution

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.110
was the right one for the moment.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.200
So they selected that one.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.960
But to make sure that
they did not lose the learning

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.840
of the Build it From Scratch team,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.250
Bill asked two members of that team
to join a new team that was emerging

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.240
to work on the next-generation system.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.000
This whole process took nearly two years,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.399
but I was told that they were
all working at breakneck speed.

00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:12.720
Early in that process, one of the
engineers had gone to Bill and said,

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.759
"We're all too busy
for this inefficient system

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:18.240
of running parallel experiments."

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.320
But as the process unfolded,
he began to understand

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.240
the wisdom of allowing talented
people to play out their passions.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.039
He admitted, "If you had forced us
to all be on one team,

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:32.480
we might have focused on proving
who was right, and winning,

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:38.000
and not on learning and discovering
what was the best answer for Google."

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.559
Why is it that Pixar and Google
are able to innovate time and again?

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:45.229
It's because they've mastered
the capabilities required for that.

00:10:45.229 --> 00:10:47.619
They know how to do
collaborative problem solving,

00:10:47.619 --> 00:10:49.759
they know how to do
discovery-driven learning

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:52.460
and they know how to do
integrated decision making.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.679
Some of you may be sitting there
and saying to yourselves right now,

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:58.519
"We don't know how to do
those things in my organization.

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:01.120
So why do they know how to
do those things at Pixar,

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.559
and why do they know how to
do those things at Google?"

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:07.080
When many of the people
that worked for Bill told us,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:13.480
in their opinion, that Bill was one
of the finest leaders in Silicon Valley,

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.649
we completely agreed;
the man is a genius.

00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:20.559
Leadership is the secret sauce.

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:22.960
But it's a different kind of leadership,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.290
not the kind many of us think about
when we think about great leadership.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.960
One of the leaders I met with
early on said to me,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.120
"Linda, I don't read books on leadership.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.039
All they do is make me feel bad."
(Laughter)

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:40.000
"In the first chapter they say
I'm supposed to create a vision.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.240
But if I'm trying to do something
that's truly new, I have no answers.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.240
I don't know what
direction we're going in

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.899
and I'm not even sure I know
how to figure out how to get there."

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:52.440
For sure, there are times
when visionary leadership

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.480
is exactly what is needed.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.879
But if we want to build organizations
that can innovate time and again,

00:11:57.879 --> 00:12:02.000
we must recast our understanding
of what leadership is about.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.720
Leading innovation is about
creating the space

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.919
where people are willing
and able to do the hard work

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:11.399
of innovative problem solving.

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:15.240
At this point, some of you
may be wondering,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.559
"What does that leadership
really look like?"

00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:22.480
At Pixar, they understand
that innovation takes a village.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.919
The leaders focus on building
a sense of community

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:28.200
and building those three capabilities.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.480
How do they define leadership?

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.759
They say leadership
is about creating a world

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:34.720
to which people want to belong.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.360
What kind of world do people
want to belong in at Pixar?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.440
A world where you're
living at the frontier.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.759
What do they focus their time on?

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:43.230
Not on creating a vision.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.360
Instead they spend
their time thinking about,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.200
"How do we design a studio that has
the sensibility of a public square

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.360
so that people will interact?

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.030
Let's put in a policy that anyone,
no matter what their level or role,

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.960
is allowed to give notes to the director

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.519
about how they feel
about a particular film.

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:02.519
What can we do to make sure

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:06.399
that all the disruptors, all the
minority voices in this organization,

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:08.399
speak up and are heard?

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:12.020
And, finally, let's bestow credit
in a very generous way."

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.320
I don't know if you've ever looked
at the credits of a Pixar movie,

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.480
but the babies born during
a production are listed there.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.879
(Laughter)

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:22.879
How did Bill think about
what his role was?

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:26.360
Bill said, "I lead
a volunteer organization.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.120
Talented people don't want
to follow me anywhere.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.679
They want to cocreate
with me the future.

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:36.159
My job is to nurture the bottom-up

00:13:36.159 --> 00:13:39.519
and not let it degenerate into chaos."

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:40.840
How did he see his role?

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.639
"I'm a role model,
I'm a human glue,

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:46.279
I'm a connector,
I'm an aggregator of viewpoints.

00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:48.519
I'm never a dictator of viewpoints."

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:50.639
Advice about how you exercise the role?

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:53.139
Hire people who argue with you.

00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:54.509
And, guess what?

00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:58.140
Sometimes it's best to be
deliberately fuzzy and vague.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.969
Some of you may
be wondering now,

00:14:00.969 --> 00:14:02.840
what are these people thinking?

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.850
They're thinking,

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.840
"I'm not the visionary,
I'm the social architect.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.440
I'm creating the space where
people are willing and able

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.789
to share and combine
their talents and passions."

00:14:13.789 --> 00:14:16.919
If some of you are worrying now
that you don't work at a Pixar,

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:18.559
or you don't work at a Google,

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:21.000
I want to tell you there's still hope.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
We've studied many organizations

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.290
that were really not
organizations you'd think of

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.220
as ones where a lot of innovation happens.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.279
We studied a general counsel
in a pharmaceutical company

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:34.000
who had to figure out how
to get the outside lawyers,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.759
19 competitors,
to collaborate and innovate.

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:40.609
We studied the head of marketing
at a German automaker

00:14:40.609 --> 00:14:43.890
where, fundamentally, they believed
that it was the design engineers,

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.009
not the marketeers,
who were allowed to be innovative.

00:14:47.009 --> 00:14:51.120
We also studied Vineet Nayar
at HCL Technologies,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.180
an Indian outsourcing company.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.729
When we met Vineet,

00:14:54.729 --> 00:14:58.080
his company was about, in his
words, to become irrelevant.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:04.099
We watched as he turned that company
into a global dynamo of I.T. innovation.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.560
At HCL technologies,
like at many companies,

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.720
the leaders had learned to see
their role as setting direction

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.309
and making sure that
no one deviated from it.

00:15:15.139 --> 00:15:19.320
What he did is tell them
it was time for them

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.740
to think about rethinking
what they were supposed to do.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.600
Because what was happening
is that everybody was looking up

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.759
and you weren't seeing
the kind of bottom-up innovation

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:31.119
we saw at Pixar or Google.

00:15:31.119 --> 00:15:32.679
So they began to work on that.

00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:36.840
They stopped giving answers, they
stopped trying to provide solutions.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.679
Instead, what they did
is they began to see

00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:43.556
the people at the bottom of the
pyramid, the young sparks,

00:15:43.556 --> 00:15:46.030
the people who were
closest to the customers,

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.580
as the source of innovation.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.713
They began to transfer
the organization's growth

00:15:51.713 --> 00:15:53.236
to that level.

00:15:55.126 --> 00:15:58.879
In Vineet's language, this was
about inverting the pyramid

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:01.919
so that you could unleash
the power of the many

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:04.840
by loosening the stranglehold of the few,

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.960
and increase the quality
and the speed of innovation

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.530
that was happening every day.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.389
For sure, Vineet and all the
other leaders that we studied

00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:18.520
were in fact visionaries.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:23.060
For sure, they understood
that that was not their role.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.240
So I don't think it is accidental
that many of you did not recognize Ed.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.919
Because Ed, like Vineet, understands
that our role as leaders

00:16:32.919 --> 00:16:37.080
is to set the stage, not perform on it.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.960
If we want to invent a better future,

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.240
and I suspect that's why
many of us are here,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.120
then we need to reimagine our task.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.799
Our task is to create the space

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:52.440
where everybody's slices of genius

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.960
can be unleashed and harnessed,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.720
and turned into works
of collective genius.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.790
Thank you.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.780
(Applause)
