WEBVTT

00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:03.692
I cannot forget them.

00:00:03.692 --> 00:00:08.469
Their names were Aslan, Alik, Andrei,

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.113
Fernanda, Fred, Galina, Gunnhild,

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:18.407
Hans, Ingeborg, Matti, Natalya,

00:00:18.407 --> 00:00:23.167
Nancy, Sheryl, Usman, Zarema,

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:25.125
and the list is longer.

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:29.599
For many, their existence,
their humanity,

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.244
has been reduced to statistics,

00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:37.540
coldly recorded as "security incidents."

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.095
For me, they were colleagues

00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:42.625
belonging to that community
of humanitarian aid workers

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.434
that tried to bring a bit of comfort

00:00:45.434 --> 00:00:49.521
to the victims of the wars
in Chechnya in the '90s.

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:54.164
They were nurses, logisticians,
shelter experts,

00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:56.997
paralegals, interpreters.

00:00:56.997 --> 00:01:01.153
And for this service, they were murdered,

00:01:01.153 --> 00:01:03.615
their families torn apart,

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:05.817
and their story largely forgotten.

00:01:06.827 --> 00:01:09.974
No one was ever sentenced
for these crimes.

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:13.041
I cannot forget them.

00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.090
They live in me somehow,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.320
their memories giving me
meaning every day.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.751
But they are also haunting
the dark street of my mind.

00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:24.712
As humanitarian aid workers,

00:01:24.712 --> 00:01:28.064
they made the choice
to be at the side of the victim,

00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:32.661
to provide some assistance,
some comfort, some protection,

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:35.587
but when they needed
protection themselves,

00:01:35.587 --> 00:01:37.295
it wasn't there.

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:40.858
When you see the headlines
of your newspaper these days

00:01:40.858 --> 00:01:43.923
with the war in Iraq or in Syria --

00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:48.087
aid worker abducted, hostage executed --

00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:50.100
but who were they?

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.025
Why were they there?

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:54.033
What motivated them?

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:57.909
How did we become
so indifferent to these crimes?

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.038
This is why I am here today with you.

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:03.435
We need to find better ways
to remember them.

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:10.566
We also need to explain the key values
to which they dedicated their lives.

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:14.778
We also need to demand justice.

00:02:16.058 --> 00:02:17.939
When in '96 I was sent

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.654
by the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees to the North Caucasus,

00:02:21.654 --> 00:02:23.526
I knew some of the risks.

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:25.879
Five colleagues had been killed,

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.946
three had been seriously injured,

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:30.291
seven had already been taken hostage.

00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:32.078
So we were careful.

00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:36.152
We were using armored 
vehicles, decoy cars,

00:02:36.152 --> 00:02:39.207
changing patterns of travel,
changing homes,

00:02:39.207 --> 00:02:41.998
all sorts of security measures.

00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:49.208
Yet on a cold winter night
of January '98, it was my turn.

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:53.185
When I entered my flat
in Vladikavkaz with a guard,

00:02:53.185 --> 00:02:55.341
we were surrounded by armed men.

00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:58.998
They took the guard,
they put him on the floor,

00:02:58.998 --> 00:03:01.622
they beat him up in front of me,

00:03:01.622 --> 00:03:04.306
tied him, dragged him away.

00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:10.321
I was handcuffed, blindfolded,
and forced to kneel,

00:03:10.321 --> 00:03:14.204
as the silencer of a gun
pressed against my neck.

00:03:14.204 --> 00:03:15.942
When it happens to you,

00:03:15.942 --> 00:03:18.975
there is no time for thinking,
no time for praying.

00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:22.749
My brain went on automatic,

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:27.115
rewinding quickly
the life I'd just left behind.

00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:29.645
It took me long minutes to figure out

00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:33.058
that those masked men there
were not there to kill me,

00:03:33.058 --> 00:03:37.231
but that someone, somewhere,
had ordered my kidnapping.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:42.622
Then a process of dehumanization
started that day.

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:47.045
I was no more than just a commodity.

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.011
I normally don't talk about this,

00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:56.028
but I'd like to share a bit with you
some of those 317 days of captivity.

00:03:56.598 --> 00:03:59.654
I was kept in an underground cellar,

00:03:59.654 --> 00:04:01.718
total darkness,

00:04:01.718 --> 00:04:05.472
for 23 hours and 45 minutes every day,

00:04:05.472 --> 00:04:08.758
and then the guards 
would come, normally two.

00:04:08.758 --> 00:04:11.432
They would bring a big piece of bread,

00:04:11.432 --> 00:04:13.936
a bowl of soup, and a candle.

00:04:15.206 --> 00:04:19.280
That candle would burn for 15 minutes,

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.088
15 minutes of precious light,

00:04:23.088 --> 00:04:27.224
and then they would take it away,
and I returned to darkness.

00:04:29.024 --> 00:04:32.538
I was chained by a metal cable to my bed.

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:35.780
I could do only four small steps.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.735
I always dreamt of the fifth one.

00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:44.976
And no TV, no radio,
no newspaper, no one to talk to.

00:04:44.976 --> 00:04:49.069
I had no towel, no soap, no toilet paper,

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:55.356
just two metal buckets open,
one for water, for one waste.

00:04:57.926 --> 00:05:02.955
Can you imagine that mock execution
can be a pastime for guards

00:05:02.955 --> 00:05:08.264
when they are sadistic
or when they are just bored or drunk?

00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:13.073
We are breaking my nerves very slowly.

00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:17.583
Isolation and darkness
are particularly difficult to describe.

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.975
How do you describe nothing?

00:05:19.975 --> 00:05:22.993
There are no words for the depths
of loneliness I reached

00:05:22.993 --> 00:05:28.118
in that very thin border
between sanity and madness.

00:05:30.168 --> 00:05:35.408
In the darkness, sometimes
I played imaginary games of checkers.

00:05:35.408 --> 00:05:37.611
I would start with the black,

00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:39.270
play with the white,

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.879
back to the black
trying to trick the other side.

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:46.860
I don't play checkers anymore.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.177
I was tormented by the thoughts of my
family and my colleague, the guard, Edik.

00:05:53.177 --> 00:05:55.987
I didn't know what had happened to him.

00:05:55.987 --> 00:05:58.472
I was trying not to think,

00:05:58.472 --> 00:05:59.932
I tried to fill up my time

00:05:59.932 --> 00:06:03.743
by doing all sorts of physical
exercise on the spot.

00:06:03.743 --> 00:06:07.683
I tried to pray, I tried all sorts
of memorization games.

00:06:09.063 --> 00:06:13.456
But darkness also creates images
and thoughts that are not normal.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:19.717
One part of your brain wants you
to resist, to shout, to cry,

00:06:19.717 --> 00:06:23.154
and the other part of the brain
orders you to shut up

00:06:23.154 --> 00:06:25.963
and just go through it.

00:06:25.963 --> 00:06:29.653
It's a constant internal debate;
there is no one to arbitrate.

00:06:31.163 --> 00:06:36.083
Once a guard came to me,
very aggressively, and he told me,

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:40.220
"Today you're going to kneel
and beg for your food."

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.842
I wasn't in a good mood,
so I insulted him.

00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:46.776
I insulted his mother,
I insulted his ancestors.

00:06:46.776 --> 00:06:51.207
The consequence was moderate:
he threw the food into my waste.

00:06:51.207 --> 00:06:54.882
The day after he came back
with the same demand.

00:06:54.882 --> 00:06:57.321
He got the same answer,

00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:01.532
which had the same consequence.

00:07:01.532 --> 00:07:05.363
Four days later,
the body was full of pain.

00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:09.705
I didn't know hunger hurt so much
when you have so little.

00:07:09.705 --> 00:07:13.119
So when the guards came down,

00:07:16.049 --> 00:07:19.063
I knelt.

00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:22.081
I begged for my food.

00:07:22.081 --> 00:07:27.668
Submission was the only way for me
to make it to another candle.

00:07:29.302 --> 00:07:31.113
After my kidnapping,

00:07:31.113 --> 00:07:34.270
I was transferred
from North Ossetia to Chechnya,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.590
three days of slow travel
in the trunks of different cars,

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.889
and upon arrival, I was interrogated

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:44.554
for 11 days by a guy called Ruslan.

00:07:44.554 --> 00:07:46.318
The routine was always the same:

00:07:46.318 --> 00:07:48.710
a bit more light, 45 minutes.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.985
He would come down to the cellar,

00:07:50.985 --> 00:07:53.249
he would ask the guards
to tie me on the chair,

00:07:53.249 --> 00:07:56.349
and he would turn on the music loud.

00:07:56.349 --> 00:07:59.530
And then he would yell questions.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.325
He would scream. He would beat me.

00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:04.228
I'll spare you the details.

00:08:04.248 --> 00:08:06.681
There are many questions
I could not understand,

00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:11.244
and there are some questions
I did not want to understand.

00:08:12.254 --> 00:08:16.433
The length of the interrogation
was the duration of the tape:

00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:19.800
15 songs, 45 minutes.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.985
I would always long for the last song.

00:08:22.575 --> 00:08:26.280
On one day, one night in that cellar,
I don't know what it was,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.297
I heard a child crying above my head,

00:08:29.297 --> 00:08:32.129
a boy, maybe two or three years old.

00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:35.776
Footsteps, confusion, people running.

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:39.900
So when Ruslan came the day after,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.369
before he put the first question to me,

00:08:42.369 --> 00:08:45.968
I asked him, "How is your son today?
Is he feeling better?"

00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:48.754
Ruslan was taken by surprise.

00:08:48.754 --> 00:08:51.583
He was furious that the guards
may have leaked some details

00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:54.161
about his private life.

00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:58.874
I kept talking about NGOs
supplying medicines to local clinics

00:08:58.874 --> 00:09:01.785
that may help his son to get better.

00:09:01.785 --> 00:09:05.909
And we talked about education,
we talked about families.

00:09:05.909 --> 00:09:07.767
He talked to me about his children.

00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:09.833
I talked to him about my daughters.

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:13.223
And then he'd talk about guns,
about cars, about women,

00:09:13.223 --> 00:09:17.542
and I had to talk about guns,
about cars, about women.

00:09:17.542 --> 00:09:21.280
And we talked until
the last song on the tape.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.923
Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met.

00:09:26.923 --> 00:09:30.220
He did not touch me anymore.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.936
He did not ask any other questions.

00:09:32.936 --> 00:09:36.791
I was no longer just a commodity.

00:09:36.791 --> 00:09:41.760
Two days after, I was transferred
to another place.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.866
There, a guard came to me,
very close -- it was quite unusual --

00:09:46.866 --> 00:09:50.025
and he said with
a very soft voice, he said,

00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:52.649
"I'd like to thank you

00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:56.689
for the assistance your organization
provided my family

00:09:56.689 --> 00:10:00.738
when we were displaced
in nearby Dagestan."

00:10:02.308 --> 00:10:05.891
What could I possibly reply?

00:10:05.891 --> 00:10:10.667
It was so painful.
It was like a blade in the belly.

00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:14.011
It took me weeks of internal thinking
to try to reconcile

00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:17.285
the good reasons we had
to assist that family

00:10:17.285 --> 00:10:20.257
and the soldier of fortune he became.

00:10:20.257 --> 00:10:22.370
He was young, he was shy.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.645
I never saw his face.

00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:27.315
He probably meant well.

00:10:27.315 --> 00:10:29.707
But in those 15 seconds,

00:10:29.707 --> 00:10:33.422
he made me question everything we did,

00:10:33.422 --> 00:10:35.813
all the sacrifices.

00:10:35.813 --> 00:10:39.366
He made me think also how they see us.

00:10:39.366 --> 00:10:42.036
Until then, I had assumed
that they know why we are there

00:10:42.036 --> 00:10:44.915
and what we are doing.

00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:47.768
One cannot assume this.

00:10:47.768 --> 00:10:52.020
Well, explaining why we do this
is not that easy,

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.812
even to our closest relatives.

00:10:55.062 --> 00:10:58.459
We are not perfect, we are not superior,

00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:00.935
we are not the world's fire brigade,

00:11:00.935 --> 00:11:03.049
we are not superheroes,

00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:04.721
we don't stop wars,

00:11:04.721 --> 00:11:10.105
we know that humanitarian response is not
a substitute for political solution.

00:11:10.105 --> 00:11:14.563
Yet we do this because one life matters.

00:11:14.563 --> 00:11:16.816
Sometimes that's the only
difference you make --

00:11:16.816 --> 00:11:20.136
one individual, one family,
a small group of individuals --

00:11:20.136 --> 00:11:22.110
and it matters.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.967
When you have a tsunami,
an earthquake or a typhoon,

00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:29.075
you see teams of rescuers
coming from all over the world,

00:11:29.075 --> 00:11:32.117
searching for survivors for weeks.

00:11:32.117 --> 00:11:34.671
Why? Nobody questions this.

00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:36.784
Every life matters,

00:11:36.784 --> 00:11:41.010
or every life should matter.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.935
This is the same for us
when we help refugees,

00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:48.795
people displaced within their country
by conflict, or stateless persons,

00:11:49.595 --> 00:11:51.390
I know many people,

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.398
when they are confronted
by overwhelming suffering,

00:11:54.398 --> 00:11:58.169
they feel powerless and they stop there.

00:11:58.169 --> 00:12:02.046
It's a pity, because there are
so many ways people can help.

00:12:02.046 --> 00:12:04.027
We don't stop with that feeling.

00:12:04.027 --> 00:12:06.678
We try to do whatever we can
to provide some assistance,

00:12:06.678 --> 00:12:09.332
some protection, some comfort.

00:12:09.332 --> 00:12:11.093
We have to.

00:12:11.093 --> 00:12:12.843
We can't do otherwise.

00:12:12.843 --> 00:12:18.197
It's what makes us feel,
I don't know, simply human.

00:12:18.197 --> 00:12:22.316
That's a picture of me
the day of my release.

00:12:22.316 --> 00:12:26.658
Months after my release,
I met the then-French prime minister.

00:12:26.658 --> 00:12:28.700
The second thing he told me:

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.231
"You were totally irresponsible
to go to the North Caucasus.

00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:36.137
You don't know how many
problems you've created for us."

00:12:38.017 --> 00:12:39.852
It was a short meeting.

00:12:39.852 --> 00:12:41.571
(Laughter)

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:47.235
I think helping people
in danger is responsible.

00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:51.763
In that war, that nobody
seriously wanted to stop,

00:12:51.763 --> 00:12:54.108
and we have many of these today,

00:12:54.108 --> 00:12:58.608
bringing some assistance to people in need
and a bit of protection

00:12:58.608 --> 00:13:00.517
was not just an act of humanity,

00:13:00.517 --> 00:13:03.419
it was making a real difference
for the people.

00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:06.670
Why could he not understand this?

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.597
We have a responsibility to try.

00:13:08.597 --> 00:13:12.431
You've heard about that concept:
Responsibility to Protect.

00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:16.512
Outcomes may depend
on various parameters.

00:13:16.512 --> 00:13:20.369
We may even fail,
but there is worse than failing --

00:13:20.369 --> 00:13:23.120
it's not even trying when we can.

00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:28.316
Well, if you are met this way,
if you sign up for this sort of job,

00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:32.954
your life is going to be full
of joy and sadness,

00:13:32.954 --> 00:13:35.633
because there are a lot of people
we cannot help,

00:13:35.633 --> 00:13:39.557
a lot of people we cannot protect,
a lot of people we did not save.

00:13:39.557 --> 00:13:41.800
I call them my ghost,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.757
and by having witnessed
their suffering from close,

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:48.904
you take a bit 
of that suffering on yourself.

00:13:49.304 --> 00:13:51.970
Many young humanitarian workers

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.988
go through their first experience
with a lot of bitterness.

00:13:54.988 --> 00:13:57.960
They are thrown into situations
where they are witness,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.072
but they are powerless
to bring any change.

00:14:01.072 --> 00:14:03.579
They have to learn to accept it

00:14:03.579 --> 00:14:06.958
and gradually turn this
into positive energy.

00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.407
It's difficult.

00:14:08.407 --> 00:14:10.945
Many don't succeed,

00:14:10.945 --> 00:14:14.953
but for those who do,
there is no other job like this.

00:14:14.953 --> 00:14:18.733
You can see the difference
you make every day.

00:14:19.643 --> 00:14:22.805
Humanitarian aid workers
know the risk they are taking

00:14:22.805 --> 00:14:27.717
in conflict areas or 
in post-conflict environments,

00:14:27.717 --> 00:14:34.429
yet our life, our job, is becoming 
increasingly life-threatening,

00:14:34.429 --> 00:14:37.611
and the sanctity of our life is fading.

00:14:39.441 --> 00:14:42.100
Do you know that since the millennium,

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.419
the number of attacks on humanitarian 
aid workers has tripled?

00:14:47.409 --> 00:14:50.041
2013 broke new records:

00:14:51.111 --> 00:14:54.383
155 colleagues killed,

00:14:54.383 --> 00:14:57.517
171 seriously wounded,

00:14:57.517 --> 00:15:00.975
134 abducted.

00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:05.178
So many broken lives.

00:15:05.178 --> 00:15:10.380
Until the beginning of the civil war
in Somalia in the late '80s,

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.490
humanitarian aid workers
were sometimes victims

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.487
of what we call collateral damages,

00:15:16.487 --> 00:15:20.202
but by and large we were not
the target of these attacks.

00:15:20.202 --> 00:15:21.756
This has changed.

00:15:21.756 --> 00:15:23.032
Look at this picture.

00:15:23.032 --> 00:15:25.866
Baghdad, August 2003:

00:15:25.866 --> 00:15:28.631
24 colleagues were killed.

00:15:28.631 --> 00:15:32.157
Gone are the days when
a U.N. blue flag or a Red Cross

00:15:32.157 --> 00:15:35.933
would automatically protect us.

00:15:35.933 --> 00:15:39.195
Criminal groups and some political groups

00:15:39.195 --> 00:15:42.051
have cross-fertilized
over the last 20 years,

00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:45.186
and they've created these sort of hybrids

00:15:45.186 --> 00:15:48.052
with whom we have no way of communicating.

00:15:48.052 --> 00:15:53.426
Humanitarian principles are tested,
questioned, and often ignored,

00:15:53.426 --> 00:15:58.312
but perhaps more importantly,
we have abandoned the search for justice.

00:15:58.312 --> 00:16:01.532
There seems to be
no consequence whatsoever

00:16:01.532 --> 00:16:04.997
for attacks against
humanitarian aid workers.

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:09.357
After my release, I was told
not to seek any form of justice.

00:16:09.357 --> 00:16:12.584
It won't do you any good,
that's what I was told.

00:16:12.584 --> 00:16:16.673
Plus, you're going to put in danger
the life of other colleagues.

00:16:17.723 --> 00:16:20.884
It took me years to see the sentencing

00:16:20.884 --> 00:16:25.175
of three people associated 
with my kidnapping,

00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:27.711
but this was the exception.

00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:32.230
There was no justice for any 
of the humanitarian aid workers

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.518
killed or abducted in Chechnya
between '95 and '99,

00:16:36.518 --> 00:16:39.146
and it's the same all over the world.

00:16:40.436 --> 00:16:42.583
This is unacceptable.

00:16:42.583 --> 00:16:44.394
This is inexcusable.

00:16:44.394 --> 00:16:49.107
Attacks on humanitarian aid workers
are war crimes in international law.

00:16:49.107 --> 00:16:52.195
Those crimes should not go unpunished.

00:16:52.195 --> 00:16:54.935
We must end this cycle of impunity.

00:16:54.935 --> 00:16:58.766
We must consider that those attacks
against humanitarian aid workers

00:16:58.766 --> 00:17:02.319
are attacks against humanity itself.

00:17:02.319 --> 00:17:05.944
That makes me furious.

00:17:06.274 --> 00:17:10.988
I know I'm very lucky
compared to the refugees I work for.

00:17:12.414 --> 00:17:16.041
I don't know what it is to have seen
my whole town destroyed.

00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:20.105
I don't know what it is to have seen
my relatives shot in front of me.

00:17:20.105 --> 00:17:24.354
I don't know what it is to lose
the protection of my country.

00:17:24.354 --> 00:17:28.649
I also know that I'm very lucky
compared to other hostages.

00:17:28.649 --> 00:17:34.331
Four days before my eventful release,
four hostages were beheaded

00:17:34.331 --> 00:17:38.726
a few miles away from where
I was kept in captivity.

00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:40.930
Why them?

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.591
Why am I here today?

00:17:44.641 --> 00:17:48.430
No easy answer.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:52.043
I was received with a lot of support
that I got from my relatives,

00:17:52.043 --> 00:17:55.862
from colleagues, from friends,
from people I didn't know.

00:17:55.862 --> 00:17:59.381
They have helped me over the years
to come out of the darkness.

00:18:00.291 --> 00:18:03.559
Not everyone was treated
with the same attention.

00:18:04.189 --> 00:18:07.814
How many of my colleagues,
after a traumatic incident,

00:18:07.814 --> 00:18:11.090
took their own life?

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.819
I can count nine that I knew personally.

00:18:14.819 --> 00:18:18.547
How many of my colleagues
went through a difficult divorce

00:18:18.547 --> 00:18:21.481
after a traumatic experience

00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:26.209
because they could not explain
anything anymore to their spouse?

00:18:26.209 --> 00:18:28.663
I've lost that count.

00:18:28.663 --> 00:18:32.223
There is a price for this type of life.

00:18:32.223 --> 00:18:36.856
In Russia, all war monuments have
this beautiful inscription at the top.

00:18:36.856 --> 00:18:40.965
It says, (In Russian)

00:18:40.965 --> 00:18:44.216
"No one is forgotten,
nothing is forgotten."

00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:48.523
I do not forget my lost colleagues.

00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:50.859
I cannot forget anything.

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:54.072
I call on you to remember their dedication

00:18:54.072 --> 00:18:57.578
and demand that humanitarian
aid workers around the world

00:18:57.578 --> 00:19:00.155
be better protected.

00:19:00.155 --> 00:19:05.751
We should not let that light of hope
they have brought to be switched off.

00:19:05.751 --> 00:19:10.441
After my ordeal, a lot of colleagues
asked me, "But why do you continue?

00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:12.647
Why do you do this sort of job?

00:19:12.647 --> 00:19:15.201
Why do you have to go back to it?"

00:19:15.201 --> 00:19:17.696
My answer was very simple:

00:19:18.066 --> 00:19:20.536
If I had quit,

00:19:20.536 --> 00:19:24.553
that would have meant
my kidnapper had won.

00:19:24.553 --> 00:19:26.904
They would have taken my soul

00:19:26.904 --> 00:19:29.179
and my humanity.

00:19:29.179 --> 00:19:31.826
Thank you.

00:19:31.826 --> 00:19:33.993
(Applause)
