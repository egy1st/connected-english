00:00:00.606 --> 00:00:06.507
Traditional prescriptions for growth
in Africa are not working very well.

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.971
After one trillion dollars
in African development-related aid

00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:13.099
in the last 60 years,

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.847
real per capita income today
is lower than it was in the 1970s.

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:21.170
Aid is not doing too well.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.588
In response,

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:26.672
the Bretton Woods institutions --
the IMF and the World Bank --

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:30.226
pushed for free trade not aid,

00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:34.451
yet the historical record
shows little empirical evidence

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:38.561
that free trade leads to economic growth.

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:42.460
The newly prescribed 
silver bullet is microcredit.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.177
We seem to be fixated
on this romanticized idea

00:00:46.177 --> 00:00:50.031
that every poor peasant in Africa
is an entrepreneur.

00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:52.098
(Laughter)

00:00:53.328 --> 00:00:58.698
Yet my work and travel
in 40-plus countries across Africa

00:00:58.698 --> 00:01:03.615
have taught me that most people
want jobs instead.

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:06.750
My solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.836
Let's invest in building
pan-African titans

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:15.061
like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim.

00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:20.959
Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa when
he founded Celtel International in '98

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.494
and built it into a mobile 
cellular provider

00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:30.901
with 24 million subscribers
across 14 African countries by 2004.

00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:35.745
The Mo model might be better
than the everyman entrepreneur model,

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:39.741
which prevents an effective means
of diffusion and knowledge-sharing.

00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:42.357
Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa

00:01:42.357 --> 00:01:47.624
where many actors and small enterprises
leads to growth through competition.

00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:51.034
Consider these two alternative scenarios.

00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:57.070
One: You loan 200 dollars 
to each of 500 banana farmers

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.967
allowing them to dry 
their surplus bananas

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:04.295
and fetch 15 percent more revenue
at the local market.

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:10.477
Or two: You give 100,000 dollars
to one savvy entrepreneur

00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:15.695
and help her set up a factory
that yields 40 percent additional income

00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:20.792
to all 500 banana farmers
and creates 50 additional jobs.

00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:24.371
We invested in the second scenario,

00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:28.867
and backed 26-year-old
Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi

00:02:28.867 --> 00:02:32.536
to set up an agro-processing
factory called Stawi

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:37.420
to produce gluten-free
banana-based flour and baby food.

00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:41.283
Stawi is leveraging economies of scale

00:02:41.283 --> 00:02:46.164
and using modern manufacturing processes
to create value for not only its owners

00:02:46.164 --> 00:02:49.499
but its workers, who have
an ownership in the business.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.708
Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi
and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim,

00:02:56.708 --> 00:03:01.855
which requires skill, financing,
local and global partnerships,

00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:04.525
and extraordinary perseverance.

00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:06.610
But why pan-African?

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.188
The scramble for Africa
during the Berlin Conference of 1884 --

00:03:12.188 --> 00:03:16.924
where, quite frankly, we Africans
were not exactly consulted --

00:03:16.924 --> 00:03:22.332
(Laughter) (Applause) --

00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:26.003
resulted in massive fragmentation

00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:28.534
and many sovereign states
with small populations:

00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:31.576
Liberia, four million;
Cape Verde, 500,000.

00:03:31.576 --> 00:03:34.315
Pan-Africa gives you one billion people,

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:38.472
granted across 55 countries
with trade barriers and other impediments,

00:03:38.472 --> 00:03:41.705
but our ancestors traded
across the continent

00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:44.282
before Europeans drew lines around us.

00:03:44.282 --> 00:03:47.719
The pan-African opportunities
outweigh the challenges,

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.155
and that's why we're expanding
Stawi's markets from just Kenya

00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:55.520
to Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana,
and anywhere else that will buy our food.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.514
We hope to help solve food security,
empower farmers, create jobs,

00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:03.948
develop the local economy,
and we hope to become rich in the process.

00:04:03.948 --> 00:04:06.167
While it's not the sexiest approach,

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:08.415
and maybe it doesn't
achieve the same feel-good

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:12.306
as giving a woman 100 dollars 
to buy a goat on kiva.org,

00:04:12.306 --> 00:04:16.231
perhaps supporting fewer,
higher-impact entrepreneurs

00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:19.204
to build massive businesses
that scale pan-Africa

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:22.364
can help change this.

00:04:22.364 --> 00:04:26.918
The political freedom
for which our forebearers fought

00:04:26.918 --> 00:04:30.636
is meaningless without economic freedom.

00:04:31.326 --> 00:04:34.136
We hope to aid this fight
for economic freedom

00:04:34.136 --> 00:04:36.597
by building world-class businesses,

00:04:36.597 --> 00:04:38.571
creating indigenous wealth,

00:04:38.571 --> 00:04:41.705
providing jobs that we
so desperately need,

00:04:41.705 --> 00:04:44.902
and hopefully helping achieve this.

00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:48.694
Africa shall rise.

00:04:48.694 --> 00:04:50.250
Thank you.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.008
(Applause)

00:04:57.471 --> 00:05:01.465
Tom Rielly: So Sangu, of course,
this is strong rhetoric.

00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:04.460
You're making 100 percent contrast
between microcredit

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.825
and regular investment
and growing regular investment.

00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:11.277
Do you think there is
a role for microcredit at all?

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:13.539
Sangu Delle: I think there is a role.

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.093
Microcredit has been a great,
innovative way

00:05:16.093 --> 00:05:20.063
to expand financial access
to the bottom of the pyramid.

00:05:20.063 --> 00:05:22.315
But for the problems we face in Africa,

00:05:22.315 --> 00:05:24.204
when we are looking
at the Marshall Plan

00:05:24.204 --> 00:05:25.821
to revitalize war-torn Europe,

00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:27.904
it was not full of donations of sheep.

00:05:27.904 --> 00:05:29.626
We need more than just microcredit.

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:31.757
We need more than just give 200 dollars.

00:05:31.757 --> 00:05:34.831
We need to build big businesses,
and we need jobs.

00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:37.227
TR: Very good. Thank you so much.

00:05:37.227 --> 00:05:39.892
(Applause)
