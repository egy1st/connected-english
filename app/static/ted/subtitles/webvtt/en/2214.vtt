00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.429
How many people here have heard of PMS?

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:06.915
Everybody, right?

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:09.399
Everyone knows that women
go a little crazy

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.270
right before they get their period,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.458
that the menstrual cycle throws them
onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:19.151
of irrationality and irritability.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.939
There's a general assumption


00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.858
that fluctuations in reproductive hormones
cause extreme emotions

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:29.391
and that the great majority of women
are affected by this.

00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:32.150
Well, I am here to tell you
that scientific evidence says

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.569
neither of those assumptions is true.

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:37.792
I'm here to give you 
the good news about PMS.

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:42.242
But first, let's take a look
at how firmly the idea of PMS

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.634
is entrenched in American culture.

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:48.210
If you examine newspaper
or magazine articles,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.552
you'll see how widely assumed it is
that everyone gets PMS.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:57.940
In an article in the magazine Redbook
titled "You: PMS Free,"

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.520
readers were informed that between 80 
to 90 percent of women suffer from PMS.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.251
L.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers

00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:09.525
that 40 to 50 percent of women
suffer from PMS,

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:14.169
and that it plays a major role
in women's mental and physical health,

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:17.160
and a couple of years ago,
even the Wall Street Journal

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.345
ran an article on calcium
as a treatment for PMS,

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:22.400
asking its female readers,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.489
"Do you turn into a witch every month?"

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:28.866
From all these articles, you would think
there must be a mountain of research


00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:32.790
verifying the widespread nature of PMS.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.948
However, after five decades of research,

00:01:35.948 --> 00:01:40.019
there's no strong consensus
on the definition, the cause,

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:44.160
the treatment, or even 
the existence of PMS.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.313
As most commonly defined by psychologists,

00:01:47.313 --> 00:01:52.282
PMS involves negative behavioral,
cognitive and physical symptoms

00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:55.208
from the time of ovulation
to menstruation.

00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:57.420
But here's where it gets tricky.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.661
Over 150 different symptoms
have been used to diagnose PMS,

00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:04.751
and here are just a few of those.

00:02:04.751 --> 00:02:06.632
Now, I want to be clear here.

00:02:06.632 --> 00:02:09.998
I'm not saying women don't get
some of these symptoms.

00:02:09.998 --> 00:02:12.622
What I'm saying is that
getting some of these symptoms

00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:15.501
doesn't amount to a mental disorder,

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:18.822
and when psychologists
come up with a disorder

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:21.108
that's so vaguely defined,

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:24.591
the label eventually becomes meaningless.

00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:27.563
With a list of symptoms
this long and wide,

00:02:27.563 --> 00:02:30.326
I could have PMS, you could have PMS,

00:02:30.326 --> 00:02:32.880
the guy in the third row here
could have PMS,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.573
my dog could have PMS.
(Laughter)

00:02:36.193 --> 00:02:38.861
Some researchers said
you had to have five symptoms.

00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:40.426
Some said three.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:43.282
Other researchers said that symptoms
were only meaningful

00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:45.116
if they were highly disturbing to you,

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:48.669
but others said minor symptoms
were just as important.

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.571
For many years, because
there was no standardization

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.660
in the definition of PMS,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.725
when psychologists tried
to report prevalence rates,

00:02:56.725 --> 00:02:59.512
their estimates ranged
from five percent of women

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.810
to 97 percent of women,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.638
so at the same time almost no one
and almost everyone had PMS.

00:03:07.638 --> 00:03:14.330
Overall, the weaknesses in the methods
of research on PMS have been considerable.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.967
First, many studies asked women
to report their symptoms retrospectively,

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:22.684
looking to the past and relying on memory,

00:03:22.684 --> 00:03:25.865
which is known to inflate reporting of PMS

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:29.230
compared to what's called
prospective reporting,

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.426
which involves keeping
a daily log of symptoms

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:33.864
for at least two months in a row.

00:03:33.864 --> 00:03:38.833
Many studies also exclusively focused
on white, middle-class women,

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:43.479
which makes it problematic
to apply study findings to all women.

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.517
We know there's a strong
cultural component to the belief in PMS

00:03:47.517 --> 00:03:51.139
because it's nearly unheard of
outside of Western nations.

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.400
Third, many studies failed
to use control groups.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.210
If we want to understand
the specific characteristics

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.730
of women who have PMS,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.932
we need to be able to compare them
to women who don't have PMS.

00:04:03.932 --> 00:04:07.160
And finally, many different types
of questionnaires were used

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.170
to diagnose PMS, focusing
on different symptoms,

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.823
symptom duration and severity.

00:04:13.823 --> 00:04:16.934
To do reliable research on any condition,

00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:19.883
scientists must agree
on the specific characteristics

00:04:19.883 --> 00:04:21.636
that make up that condition

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:23.749
so they're all talking
about the same thing,

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:27.185
and with PMS, this has not been the case.

00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:29.461
However, in 1994,

00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:33.129
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders,

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.428
known as the DSM, thankfully --

00:04:35.428 --> 00:04:39.306
it's also the manual
for mental health professionals --

00:04:39.306 --> 00:04:43.230
they redefined PMS as PMDD,

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.248
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.

00:04:46.248 --> 00:04:52.192
And dysphoria refers to
a feeling of agitation or unease.

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:55.652
And according to these new DSM guidelines,

00:04:55.652 --> 00:04:58.879
in most menstrual cycles in the last year,

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.130
at least five of 11 possible symptoms

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.822
must appear in the week
before menstruation starts;

00:05:05.822 --> 00:05:09.189
the symptoms must improve
once menstruation has begun;

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:13.931
and the symptoms must be absent
the week after menstruation has ended.

00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:18.429
One of these symptoms must come
from this list of four:

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:23.677
marked mood swings, irritability,
anxiety, or depression.

00:05:23.677 --> 00:05:26.509
The other symptoms could come
from the first slide

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.646
or from those on the second slide,

00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:31.269
including symptoms like
feeling out of control

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:34.938
and changes in sleep or appetite.

00:05:34.938 --> 00:05:38.815
The DSM also required now
that the symptoms

00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:42.995
should be associated with
clinically significant distress --

00:05:42.995 --> 00:05:45.828
there should be some kind
of disturbance in work

00:05:45.828 --> 00:05:48.753
or school or social relationships --

00:05:48.753 --> 00:05:52.259
and that symptoms and symptom severity
should now be documented

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.276
by keeping a daily log
for at least two cycles in a row.

00:05:56.276 --> 00:06:00.131
And finally, the DSM required that
the emotional disturbance

00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:05.889
should be more than simply an exacerbation
of an already existing disorder.

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.675
So scientifically speaking,
this is an improvement.

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:11.322
We now have a limited number of symptoms,

00:06:11.322 --> 00:06:14.898
and a high impact on functioning
that's required,

00:06:14.898 --> 00:06:20.354
and the reporting and timing of symptoms
have both become very specific.

00:06:20.354 --> 00:06:23.164
Well, using this criteria

00:06:23.164 --> 00:06:25.310
and looking at most recent studies,

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.925
we see that on average,

00:06:26.925 --> 00:06:32.890
three to eight percent of women
suffer from PMDD.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.470
Not all women, not most women,

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.240
not the majority of women,
not even a lot of women:

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.926
three to eight percent.

00:06:40.926 --> 00:06:45.883
For everyone else, variables
like stressful events or happy occasions

00:06:45.883 --> 00:06:47.927
or even day of the week

00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:52.012
are more powerful predictors of mood
than time of the month,

00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:55.452
and this is the information
the scientific community has had

00:06:55.452 --> 00:06:56.982
since the 1990s.

00:06:56.982 --> 00:06:59.722
In 2002, my colleagues and I
published an article

00:06:59.722 --> 00:07:02.856
describing the PMS and PMDD research,

00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:07.129
and several similar articles have appeared
in psychology journals.

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:11.540
The questions is, why hasn't this
information trickled down to the public?

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.116
Why do these myths persist?

00:07:15.116 --> 00:07:18.413
Well, certainly the onslaught
of messages that women receive

00:07:18.413 --> 00:07:23.557
from books, TV, movies, the Internet,
that everyone gets PMS

00:07:23.557 --> 00:07:27.190
go a long way in convincing them
it must be true.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:32.360
Research tells us that the more
a woman believes that everyone gets PMS,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.268
the more likely she is
to erroneously report that she has it.

00:07:36.268 --> 00:07:38.544
Let me tell you what I mean
by "erroneously."

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:41.270
You might ask her, "Do you have PMS?"

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.613
and she says yes,

00:07:42.613 --> 00:07:45.031
but then, when you have her 
keep a daily log

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.430
of psychological symptoms for two months,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.704
no correlation is found
between her symptoms

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:52.496
and time of the month.

00:07:53.016 --> 00:07:57.385
Another reason for
the persistence of the PMS myth

00:07:57.385 --> 00:08:00.846
has to do with the narrow boundaries
of the feminine role.

00:08:00.846 --> 00:08:03.494
Feminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler

00:08:03.494 --> 00:08:07.486
have suggested that
taking on the label of PMS

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:12.919
allows women to express emotions that
would otherwise be considered unladylike.

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:16.310
The near universal definition
of a good woman

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.838
is one who is happy, loving,
caring for others,

00:08:19.838 --> 00:08:22.694
and taking great satisfaction
from that role.

00:08:22.694 --> 00:08:27.846
Well, PMS has become a permission slip
to be angry, complain, be irritated,

00:08:27.846 --> 00:08:31.214
without losing the title of good woman.

00:08:31.214 --> 00:08:35.254
We know that the variables
in a woman's environment

00:08:35.254 --> 00:08:38.714
are much more likely to cause her
to be angry than her hormones,

00:08:38.714 --> 00:08:41.570
but when she attributes anger to hormones,

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.337
she's absolved
of responsibility or criticism.

00:08:44.337 --> 00:08:47.790
"Oh, that's not who she is.
It's out of her control."

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:54.406
And while this can be a useful tool,
it serves to invalidate women's emotions.

00:08:54.406 --> 00:08:57.127
When people respond to a woman's anger

00:08:57.127 --> 00:09:00.122
with the thought, "Oh,
it's just that time of the month,"

00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:05.480
her ability to be taken seriously
or effect change is severely limited.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.467
So who else benefits from the myth of PMS?

00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:11.511
Well, I can tell you that treating PMS

00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:15.992
has become a profitable, 
thriving industry.

00:09:15.992 --> 00:09:22.772
Amazon.com currently offers
over 1,900 books on PMS treatment.

00:09:22.772 --> 00:09:25.233
A quick Google search
will bring up a cornucopia

00:09:25.233 --> 00:09:28.971
of clinics, workshops and seminars.

00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:31.874
Reputable Internet sources
of medical information

00:09:31.874 --> 00:09:36.634
like WebMD or the Mayo Clinic
list PMS as a known disorder.

00:09:36.634 --> 00:09:39.141
It's not a known disorder,
but they list it.

00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:43.112
And they also list the medications that
physicians have prescribed to treat it,

00:09:43.112 --> 00:09:46.048
like anti-depressants or hormones.

00:09:46.048 --> 00:09:51.772
Interestingly, though, both websites
say that the success of medication

00:09:51.772 --> 00:09:55.859
in treating PMS symptoms
vary from woman to woman.

00:09:55.859 --> 00:09:57.590
Well, that doesn't make sense.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.224
If you've got a distinct disorder
with a distinct cause,

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:02.174
which PMS is supposed to be,

00:10:02.174 --> 00:10:05.982
then the treatment should bring
improvement for a great number of women.

00:10:05.982 --> 00:10:08.536
This has not been the case
with these treatments,

00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:12.646
and FDA regulations say that
for a drug to be deemed effective,

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:14.713
a large portion of the target population

00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:17.871
should see clinically
significant improvement.

00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:21.887
So we have not had that at all
with these so-called treatments.

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:26.200
However, the financial gain
of perpetuating the myth

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.201
that PMS is a common mental disorder

00:10:29.201 --> 00:10:33.270
and is treatable is quite substantial.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.724
When women are prescribed
drugs like anti-depressants or hormones,

00:10:36.724 --> 00:10:41.833
medical protocol requires that they have
physician follow-up every three months.

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:43.806
That's a lot of doctor visits.

00:10:43.806 --> 00:10:46.314
Pharmaceutical companies
reap untold profits

00:10:46.314 --> 00:10:50.238
when women are convinced
they should take a prescribed medication

00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:53.140
for all of their child-bearing lives.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.764
Over-the-counter drugs like Midol

00:10:55.764 --> 00:11:00.176
even claim to treat PMS symptoms
like tension and irritability,

00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:04.169
even though they only contain
a diuretic, a pain reliever

00:11:04.169 --> 00:11:06.143
and caffeine.

00:11:06.143 --> 00:11:09.579
Now, far be it from me to argue
with the magical powers of caffeine,

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:13.944
but I don't think reducing tension
is one of them.

00:11:13.944 --> 00:11:20.510
Since 2002, Midol has marketed
a Teen Midol to adolescents.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.340
They are aiming at young girls early,

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.585
to convince them that everyone gets PMS
and that it will make you a monster,

00:11:27.585 --> 00:11:29.864
but wait, there's something
you can do about it:

00:11:29.864 --> 00:11:32.926
Take Midol and you will be
a human being again.

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:39.450
In 2013, Midol took in 48 million dollars
in sales revenue.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.100
So while perpetuating the myth of PMS
has been lucrative for some,

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.320
it comes with some serious
adverse consequences for women.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.874
First, it contributes
to the medicalization

00:11:50.874 --> 00:11:53.544
of women's reproductive health.

00:11:53.544 --> 00:11:56.748
The medical field has a long history
of conceptualizing

00:11:56.748 --> 00:12:02.158
women's reproductive processes
as illnesses that require treatment,

00:12:02.158 --> 00:12:06.268
and this has come at many costs,
including excessive Cesarean deliveries,

00:12:06.268 --> 00:12:08.978
hysterectomies and prescribed
hormone treatments

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:13.005
that have harmed rather than enhanced
women's health.

00:12:13.675 --> 00:12:18.505
Second, the PMS myth also contributes
to the stereotype of women

00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:21.871
as irrational and overemotional.

00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:25.610
When the menstrual cycle is described
as a hormonal roller coaster

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.430
that turns women into angry beasts,

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.775
it becomes easy to question 
the competence of all women.


00:12:32.775 --> 00:12:35.594
Women have made tremendous strides
in the workforce,

00:12:35.594 --> 00:12:39.657
but still there's a minuscule number
of women at the highest echelons

00:12:39.657 --> 00:12:42.397
of fields like government or business,

00:12:42.397 --> 00:12:47.343
and when we think about
who makes for a good CEO or senator,

00:12:47.343 --> 00:12:52.462
someone who has qualities like 
rationality, steadiness, competence

00:12:52.462 --> 00:12:53.971
come to mind,

00:12:53.971 --> 00:12:57.512
and in our culture, that sounds more
like a man than a woman,

00:12:57.512 --> 00:13:01.170
and the PMS myth contributes to that.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.339
Psychologists know that
the moods of men and women

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:07.172
are more similar than different.

00:13:07.172 --> 00:13:11.235
One study followed men and women
for four to six months

00:13:11.235 --> 00:13:14.300
and found that the number
of mood swings they experienced

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.154
and the severity of those mood swings
were no different.

00:13:18.154 --> 00:13:22.357
And finally, the PMS myth
keeps women from dealing

00:13:22.357 --> 00:13:26.374
with the actual issues
causing them emotional upset.

00:13:26.374 --> 00:13:30.799
Individual issues like
quality of relationship or work conditions

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:35.313
or societal issues like racism or sexism
or the daily grind of poverty

00:13:35.313 --> 00:13:38.657
are all strongly related to daily mood.

00:13:38.657 --> 00:13:42.420
Sweeping emotions under the rug of PMS

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.272
keeps women from understanding
the source of their negative emotions,

00:13:46.272 --> 00:13:51.640
but it also takes away the opportunity
to take any action to change them.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.469
So the good news about PMS

00:13:54.469 --> 00:13:59.205
is that while some women get some symptoms
because of the menstrual cycle,

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:02.758
the great majority don't
get a mental disorder.

00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:05.985
They go to work or school,
take care of their families,

00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:08.284
and function at a normal level.

00:14:08.284 --> 00:14:11.511
We know the emotions and moods
of men and women

00:14:11.511 --> 00:14:13.462
are more similar than different,

00:14:13.462 --> 00:14:19.082
so let's walk away from
the tired old PMS myth of women as witches

00:14:19.097 --> 00:14:23.945
and embrace the reality of high emotional
and professional functioning

00:14:23.945 --> 00:14:27.149
the great majority of women
live every day.

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:29.425
Thank you.

00:14:29.425 --> 00:14:31.537
(Applause)
