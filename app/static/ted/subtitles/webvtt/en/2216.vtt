WEBVTT

00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:02.773
I'm thrilled to be here tonight

00:00:02.773 --> 00:00:05.152
to share with you something
we've been working on

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:07.242
for over two years,

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:09.796
and it's in the area
of additive manufacturing,

00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:12.513
also known as 3D printing.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.231
You see this object here.

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:18.039
It looks fairly simple,
but it's quite complex at the same time.

00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:21.800
It's a set of concentric
geodesic structures

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.795
with linkages between each one.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:30.797
In its context, it is not manufacturable
by traditional manufacturing techniques.

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:35.290
It has a symmetry such
that you can't injection mold it.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.879
You can't even manufacture it
through milling.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.117
This is a job for a 3D printer,

00:00:42.117 --> 00:00:46.598
but most 3D printers would take between
three and 10 hours to fabricate it,

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:50.824
and we're going to take the risk tonight
to try to fabricate it onstage

00:00:50.824 --> 00:00:53.401
during this 10-minute talk.

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.440
Wish us luck.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.624
Now, 3D printing is actually a misnomer.

00:00:59.624 --> 00:01:03.399
It's actually 2D printing
over and over again,

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:07.761
and it in fact uses the technologies
associated with 2D printing.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:13.360
Think about inkjet printing where you
lay down ink on a page to make letters,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.346
and then do that over and over again
to build up a three-dimensional object.

00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:20.417
In microelectronics, they use something

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:22.737
called lithography to do
the same sort of thing,

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:24.945
to make the transistors
and integrated circuits

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:26.997
and build up a structure several times.

00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:29.399
These are all 2D printing technologies.

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.987
Now, I'm a chemist,
a material scientist too,

00:01:33.987 --> 00:01:36.711
and my co-inventors
are also material scientists,

00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:39.010
one a chemist, one a physicist,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.936
and we began to be
interested in 3D printing.

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:47.531
And very often, as you know,
new ideas are often simple connections

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:51.274
between people with different experiences
in different communities,

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:52.751
and that's our story.

00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:56.122
Now, we were inspired

00:01:56.122 --> 00:02:00.893
by the "Terminator 2" scene for T-1000,

00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:05.836
and we thought, why couldn't a 3D printer
operate in this fashion,

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:10.362
where you have an object
arise out of a puddle

00:02:11.052 --> 00:02:13.520
in essentially real time

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.749
with essentially no waste

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.071
to make a great object?

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.488
Okay, just like the movies.

00:02:19.488 --> 00:02:22.877
And could we be inspired by Hollywood

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:26.384
and come up with ways
to actually try to get this to work?

00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:28.450
And that was our challenge.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.817
And our approach would be,
if we could do this,

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:35.671
then we could fundamentally address
the three issues holding back 3D printing

00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:38.086
from being a manufacturing process.

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:40.617
One, 3D printing takes forever.

00:02:40.617 --> 00:02:45.841
There are mushrooms that grow faster
than 3D printed parts. (Laughter)

00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.417
The layer by layer process

00:02:49.417 --> 00:02:52.319
leads to defects
in mechanical properties,

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.266
and if we could grow continuously,
we could eliminate those defects.

00:02:56.266 --> 00:03:01.398
And in fact, if we could grow really fast,
we could also start using materials

00:03:01.398 --> 00:03:06.042
that are self-curing,
and we could have amazing properties.

00:03:06.042 --> 00:03:10.151
So if we could pull this off,
imitate Hollywood,

00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.912
we could in fact address 3D manufacturing.

00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:17.953
Our approach is to use
some standard knowledge

00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:20.553
in polymer chemistry

00:03:20.553 --> 00:03:27.152
to harness light and oxygen
to grow parts continuously.

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:30.099
Light and oxygen work in different ways.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.141
Light can take a resin
and convert it to a solid,

00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:35.295
can convert a liquid to a solid.

00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:38.829
Oxygen inhibits that process.

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.080
So light and oxygen
are polar opposites from one another

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.588
from a chemical point of view,

00:03:44.588 --> 00:03:48.001
and if we can control spatially
the light and oxygen,

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:49.948
we could control this process.

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:53.739
And we refer to this as CLIP.
[Continuous Liquid Interface Production.]

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.615
It has three functional components.

00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:00.326
One, it has a reservoir
that holds the puddle,

00:04:00.326 --> 00:04:02.205
just like the T-1000.

00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:04.621
At the bottom of the reservoir
is a special window.

00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:06.112
I'll come back to that.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:09.892
In addition, it has a stage
that will lower into the puddle

00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:12.481
and pull the object out of the liquid.

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:16.285
The third component
is a digital light projection system

00:04:16.285 --> 00:04:18.305
underneath the reservoir,

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:21.578
illuminating with light
in the ultraviolet region.

00:04:22.048 --> 00:04:25.271
Now, the key is that this window
in the bottom of this reservoir,

00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:28.150
it's a composite,
it's a very special window.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.796
It's not only transparent to light
but it's permeable to oxygen.

00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:34.455
It's got characteristics
like a contact lens.

00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:37.716
So we can see how the process works.

00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:41.130
You can start to see that
as you lower a stage in there,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.309
in a traditional process,
with an oxygen-impermeable window,

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:47.148
you make a two-dimensional pattern

00:04:48.008 --> 00:04:51.370
and you end up gluing that onto the window
with a traditional window,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.922
and so in order to introduce
the next layer, you have to separate it,

00:04:54.922 --> 00:04:58.451
introduce new resin, reposition it,

00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:00.910
and do this process over and over again.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.234
But with our very special window,

00:05:03.234 --> 00:05:06.563
what we're able to do is,
with oxygen coming through the bottom

00:05:06.563 --> 00:05:07.816
as light hits it,

00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:11.926
that oxygen inhibits the reaction,

00:05:11.926 --> 00:05:14.550
and we form a dead zone.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.869
This dead zone is on the order
of tens of microns thick,

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:22.096
so that's two or three diameters
of a red blood cell,

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:24.627
right at the window interface
that remains a liquid,

00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:26.577
and we pull this object up,

00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:28.969
and as we talked about in a Science paper,

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.682
as we change the oxygen content,
we can change the dead zone thickness.

00:05:33.682 --> 00:05:37.374
And so we have a number of key variables
that we control: oxygen content,

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:40.439
the light, the light intensity,
the dose to cure,

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:42.401
the viscosity, the geometry,

00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:45.817
and we use very sophisticated software
to control this process.

00:05:46.697 --> 00:05:49.460
The result is pretty staggering.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.196
It's 25 to 100 times faster
than traditional 3D printers,

00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:56.170
which is game-changing.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.506
In addition, as our ability
to deliver liquid to that interface,

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:04.246
we can go 1,000 times faster I believe,

00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:07.803
and that in fact opens up the opportunity
for generating a lot of heat,

00:06:07.803 --> 00:06:11.866
and as a chemical engineer,
I get very excited at heat transfer

00:06:11.866 --> 00:06:16.045
and the idea that we might one day
have water-cooled 3D printers,

00:06:16.045 --> 00:06:18.437
because they're going so fast.

00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:22.500
In addition, because we're growing things,
we eliminate the layers,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.474
and the parts are monolithic.

00:06:24.474 --> 00:06:26.564
You don't see the surface structure.

00:06:26.564 --> 00:06:29.057
You have molecularly smooth surfaces.

00:06:29.057 --> 00:06:33.297
And the mechanical properties
of most parts made in a 3D printer

00:06:33.297 --> 00:06:37.593
are notorious for having properties
that depend on the orientation

00:06:37.593 --> 00:06:41.354
with which how you printed it,
because of the layer-like structure.

00:06:41.354 --> 00:06:43.699
But when you grow objects like this,

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:47.368
the properties are invariant
with the print direction.

00:06:47.368 --> 00:06:50.317
These look like injection-molded parts,

00:06:50.317 --> 00:06:53.729
which is very different
than traditional 3D manufacturing.

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:57.259
In addition, we're able to throw

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.835
the entire polymer
chemistry textbook at this,

00:07:00.835 --> 00:07:04.826
and we're able to design chemistries
that can give rise to the properties

00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:07.868
you really want in a 3D-printed object.

00:07:07.868 --> 00:07:09.205
(Applause)

00:07:09.205 --> 00:07:12.439
There it is. That's great.

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:17.627
You always take the risk that something
like this won't work onstage, right?

00:07:18.177 --> 00:07:21.056
But we can have materials
with great mechanical properties.

00:07:21.056 --> 00:07:23.494
For the first time, we can have elastomers

00:07:23.494 --> 00:07:25.955
that are high elasticity
or high dampening.

00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:29.368
Think about vibration control
or great sneakers, for example.

00:07:29.368 --> 00:07:31.978
We can make materials
that have incredible strength,

00:07:32.828 --> 00:07:36.404
high strength-to-weight ratio,
really strong materials,

00:07:36.404 --> 00:07:38.517
really great elastomers,

00:07:38.517 --> 00:07:41.242
so throw that in the audience there.

00:07:41.242 --> 00:07:43.878
So great material properties.

00:07:43.878 --> 00:07:47.293
And so the opportunity now,
if you actually make a part

00:07:47.293 --> 00:07:50.973
that has the properties
to be a final part,

00:07:50.973 --> 00:07:54.073
and you do it in game-changing speeds,

00:07:54.073 --> 00:07:56.860
you can actually transform manufacturing.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.716
Right now, in manufacturing,
what happens is,

00:07:59.716 --> 00:08:02.678
the so-called digital thread
in digital manufacturing.

00:08:02.678 --> 00:08:07.717
We go from a CAD drawing, a design,
to a prototype to manufacturing.

00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:10.440
Often, the digital thread is broken
right at prototype,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.872
because you can't go
all the way to manufacturing

00:08:12.872 --> 00:08:16.587
because most parts don't have
the properties to be a final part.

00:08:16.587 --> 00:08:18.978
We now can connect the digital thread

00:08:18.978 --> 00:08:23.227
all the way from design
to prototyping to manufacturing,

00:08:23.227 --> 00:08:26.176
and that opportunity
really opens up all sorts of things,

00:08:26.176 --> 00:08:31.129
from better fuel-efficient cars
dealing with great lattice properties

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:33.080
with high strength-to-weight ratio,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.508
new turbine blades,
all sorts of wonderful things.

00:08:37.468 --> 00:08:42.623
Think about if you need a stent
in an emergency situation,

00:08:42.623 --> 00:08:46.593
instead of the doctor pulling off
a stent out of the shelf

00:08:46.593 --> 00:08:48.822
that was just standard sizes,

00:08:48.822 --> 00:08:52.978
having a stent that's designed
for you, for your own anatomy

00:08:52.978 --> 00:08:54.789
with your own tributaries,

00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:58.038
printed in an emergency situation
in real time out of the properties

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:01.477
such that the stent could go away
after 18 months: really-game changing.

00:09:01.477 --> 00:09:05.633
Or digital dentistry, and making
these kinds of structures

00:09:05.633 --> 00:09:08.814
even while you're in the dentist chair.

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:11.530
And look at the structures
that my students are making

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.504
at the University of North Carolina.

00:09:13.504 --> 00:09:16.313
These are amazing microscale structures.

00:09:16.313 --> 00:09:19.309
You know, the world is really good
at nano-fabrication.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:23.599
Moore's Law has driven things
from 10 microns and below.

00:09:23.599 --> 00:09:25.201
We're really good at that,

00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:29.241
but it's actually very hard to make things
from 10 microns to 1,000 microns,

00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:31.261
the mesoscale.

00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:34.094
And subtractive techniques
from the silicon industry

00:09:34.094 --> 00:09:35.510
can't do that very well.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.159
They can't etch wafers that well.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:39.109
But this process is so gentle,

00:09:39.109 --> 00:09:41.594
we can grow these objects
up from the bottom

00:09:41.594 --> 00:09:43.590
using additive manufacturing

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.843
and make amazing things
in tens of seconds,

00:09:45.843 --> 00:09:47.932
opening up new sensor technologies,

00:09:47.932 --> 00:09:50.417
new drug delivery techniques,

00:09:50.417 --> 00:09:54.149
new lab-on-a-chip applications,
really game-changing stuff.

00:09:55.149 --> 00:09:59.983
So the opportunity of making
a part in real time

00:09:59.983 --> 00:10:02.816
that has the properties to be a final part

00:10:02.816 --> 00:10:05.792
really opens up 3D manufacturing,

00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:08.992
and for us, this is very exciting,
because this really is owning

00:10:08.992 --> 00:10:15.589
the intersection between hardware,
software and molecular science,

00:10:15.589 --> 00:10:19.755
and I can't wait to see what designers
and engineers around the world

00:10:19.755 --> 00:10:22.029
are going to be able to do
with this great tool.
