00:00:00.763 --> 00:00:05.737
You're looking at a woman
who was publicly silent for a decade.

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:08.290
Obviously, that's changed,

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:10.277
but only recently.

00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:15.408
It was several months ago that I gave
my very first major public talk,

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:18.193
at the Forbes "30 Under 30 Summit" --

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:22.431
1,500 brilliant people,
all under the age of 30.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:29.625
That meant that in 1998,
the oldest among the group were only 14,

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.969
and the youngest, just four.

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:37.994
I joked with them that some might only
have heard of me from rap songs.

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:40.487
Yes, I'm in rap songs.

00:00:40.511 --> 00:00:41.575
(Laughter)

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:44.583
Almost 40 rap songs.

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:46.165
(Laughter)

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.407
But the night of my speech,
a surprising thing happened.

00:00:50.144 --> 00:00:56.116
At the age of 41, I was hit on
by a 27-year-old guy.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.142
(Laughter)

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.725
I know, right?

00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.698
He was charming, and I was flattered,

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:04.457
and I declined.

00:01:05.212 --> 00:01:07.732
You know what his unsuccessful
pickup line was?

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.671
He could make me feel 22 again.

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:15.739
(Laughter)

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:18.613
(Applause)

00:01:18.637 --> 00:01:20.630
I realized, later that night,

00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:26.139
I'm probably the only person over 40
who does not want to be 22 again.

00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:29.085
(Laughter)

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:34.886
(Applause)

00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:39.747
At the age of 22,
I fell in love with my boss.

00:01:40.723 --> 00:01:43.091
And at the age of 24,

00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:45.703
I learned the devastating consequences.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.847
Can I see a show of hands of anyone here

00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:54.988
who didn't make a mistake
or do something they regretted at 22?

00:01:57.232 --> 00:01:59.718
Yep. That's what I thought.

00:02:00.473 --> 00:02:06.230
So like me, at 22, a few of you
may have also taken wrong turns

00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:09.584
and fallen in love with the wrong person,

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:11.307
maybe even your boss.

00:02:12.313 --> 00:02:14.035
Unlike me, though,

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:18.516
your boss probably wasn't the president
of the United States of America.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.580
(Laughter)

00:02:19.604 --> 00:02:22.084
Of course, life is full of surprises.

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:28.737
Not a day goes by that I'm not
reminded of my mistake,

00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:31.034
and I regret that mistake deeply.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.177
In 1998, after having been swept up
into an improbable romance,

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:45.961
I was then swept up into the eye
of a political, legal and media maelstrom

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:48.192
like we had never seen before.

00:02:49.082 --> 00:02:51.710
Remember, just a few years earlier,

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.047
news was consumed from just three places:

00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:57.313
reading a newspaper or magazine,

00:02:57.337 --> 00:02:59.051
listening to the radio

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:00.658
or watching television.

00:03:00.682 --> 00:03:02.280
That was it.

00:03:02.304 --> 00:03:05.042
But that wasn't my fate.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.734
Instead, this scandal was brought to you

00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:11.636
by the digital revolution.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.862
That meant we could access
all the information we wanted,

00:03:15.886 --> 00:03:19.420
when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere.

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:25.033
And when the story broke in January 1998,

00:03:25.057 --> 00:03:27.034
it broke online.

00:03:27.835 --> 00:03:32.313
It was the first time the traditional news
was usurped by the internet

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.076
for a major news story --

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.917
a click that reverberated
around the world.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.898
What that meant for me personally

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:48.311
was that overnight, I went from being
a completely private figure

00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:52.076
to a publicly humiliated one, worldwide.

00:03:53.272 --> 00:03:59.262
I was patient zero of losing
a personal reputation on a global scale

00:03:59.286 --> 00:04:01.421
almost instantaneously.

00:04:03.381 --> 00:04:06.257
This rush to judgment,
enabled by technology,

00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:09.358
led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.803
Granted, it was before social media,

00:04:12.827 --> 00:04:16.207
but people could still comment online,

00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:17.906
e-mail stories,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.941
and, of course, e-mail cruel jokes.

00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:25.977
News sources plastered
photos of me all over

00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:29.581
to sell newspapers, banner ads online,

00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:31.906
and to keep people tuned to the TV.

00:04:33.962 --> 00:04:39.353
Do you recall a particular image of me,
say, wearing a beret?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.084
Now, I admit I made mistakes --

00:04:44.108 --> 00:04:46.254
especially wearing that beret.

00:04:46.278 --> 00:04:48.204
(Laughter)

00:04:48.228 --> 00:04:50.890
But the attention and judgment
that I received --

00:04:50.914 --> 00:04:54.237
not the story, but that
I personally received --

00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:55.821
was unprecedented.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.163
I was branded as a tramp,

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:01.626
tart,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.340
slut,

00:05:03.364 --> 00:05:04.975
whore,

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:06.149
bimbo,

00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:08.972
and, of course, "that woman."

00:05:10.662 --> 00:05:12.709
I was seen by many,

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:15.196
but actually known by few.

00:05:16.863 --> 00:05:19.958
And I get it: it was easy to forget

00:05:19.982 --> 00:05:22.763
that that woman was dimensional,

00:05:22.787 --> 00:05:24.554
had a soul

00:05:24.578 --> 00:05:26.170
and was once unbroken.

00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:33.882
When this happened to me 17 years ago,
there was no name for it.

00:05:34.604 --> 00:05:38.521
Now we call it "cyberbullying"
and "online harassment."

00:05:40.584 --> 00:05:43.700
Today, I want to share
some of my experience with you,

00:05:43.724 --> 00:05:48.012
talk about how that experience has helped
shape my cultural observations,

00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:52.597
and how I hope my past experience
can lead to a change

00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:55.241
that results in less suffering for others.

00:05:57.887 --> 00:06:03.136
In 1998, I lost my reputation
and my dignity.

00:06:03.734 --> 00:06:06.321
I lost almost everything.

00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:09.231
And I almost lost my life.

00:06:13.031 --> 00:06:14.809
Let me paint a picture for you.

00:06:17.365 --> 00:06:20.215
It is September of 1998.

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:23.690
I'm sitting in a windowless office room

00:06:23.714 --> 00:06:26.197
inside the Office
of the Independent Counsel,

00:06:27.213 --> 00:06:30.040
underneath humming fluorescent lights.

00:06:30.892 --> 00:06:33.997
I'm listening to the sound of my voice,

00:06:34.974 --> 00:06:38.350
my voice on surreptitiously
taped phone calls

00:06:38.374 --> 00:06:41.034
that a supposed friend
had made the year before.

00:06:42.018 --> 00:06:45.307
I'm here because
I've been legally required

00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:50.997
to personally authenticate
all 20 hours of taped conversation.

00:06:52.916 --> 00:06:56.997
For the past eight months,
the mysterious content of these tapes

00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:59.897
has hung like the sword
of Damocles over my head.

00:07:00.747 --> 00:07:03.714
I mean, who can remember
what they said a year ago?

00:07:05.587 --> 00:07:08.599
Scared and mortified, I listen,

00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:14.755
listen as I prattle on about the flotsam
and jetsam of the day;

00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:19.128
listen as I confess my love
for the president,

00:07:19.152 --> 00:07:21.337
and, of course, my heartbreak;

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:28.134
listen to my sometimes catty,
sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self

00:07:28.158 --> 00:07:32.031
being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth;

00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:38.340
listen, deeply, deeply ashamed,
to the worst version of myself,

00:07:39.363 --> 00:07:41.719
a self I don't even recognize.

00:07:44.537 --> 00:07:48.382
A few days later, the Starr Report
is released to Congress,

00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:53.204
and all of those tapes and transcripts,
those stolen words, form a part of it.

00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:58.340
That people can read the transcripts
is horrific enough.

00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:00.742
But a few weeks later,

00:08:02.044 --> 00:08:04.709
the audiotapes are aired on TV,

00:08:04.733 --> 00:08:07.941
and significant portions
made available online.

00:08:10.597 --> 00:08:14.015
The public humiliation was excruciating.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.304
Life was almost unbearable.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.095
This was not something that happened
with regularity back then in 1998,

00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:31.812
and by "this," I mean the stealing
of people's private words, actions,

00:08:31.836 --> 00:08:34.299
conversations or photos,

00:08:34.323 --> 00:08:35.942
and then making them public --

00:08:36.776 --> 00:08:38.458
public without consent,

00:08:39.214 --> 00:08:41.021
public without context

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:44.129
and public without compassion.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.236
Fast-forward 12 years, to 2010,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.706
and now social media has been born.

00:08:52.888 --> 00:08:57.897
The landscape has sadly become much
more populated with instances like mine,

00:08:57.921 --> 00:09:00.409
whether or not someone
actually made a mistake,

00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:05.584
and now, it's for both public
and private people.

00:09:06.682 --> 00:09:11.611
The consequences for some
have become dire, very dire.

00:09:14.198 --> 00:09:18.878
I was on the phone with my mom
in September of 2010,

00:09:18.902 --> 00:09:22.296
and we were talking about the news
of a young college freshman

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.053
from Rutgers University,

00:09:24.077 --> 00:09:25.756
named Tyler Clementi.

00:09:26.724 --> 00:09:32.301
Sweet, sensitive, creative Tyler
was secretly webcammed by his roommate

00:09:32.325 --> 00:09:34.531
while being intimate with another man.

00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:39.271
When the online world
learned of this incident,

00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:42.430
the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.

00:09:44.464 --> 00:09:45.692
A few days later,

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.641
Tyler jumped from
the George Washington Bridge

00:09:49.665 --> 00:09:50.900
to his death.

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:52.913
He was 18.

00:09:55.453 --> 00:10:00.061
My mom was beside herself about
what happened to Tyler and his family,

00:10:00.085 --> 00:10:02.918
and she was gutted with pain

00:10:02.942 --> 00:10:05.761
in a way that I just couldn't
quite understand.

00:10:06.618 --> 00:10:11.164
And then eventually,
I realized she was reliving 1998,

00:10:12.021 --> 00:10:15.954
reliving a time when she sat
by my bed every night,

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.721
reliving -- (Chokes up)

00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:24.347
sorry -- reliving a time when she made me
shower with the bathroom door open,

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:29.065
and reliving a time
when both of my parents feared

00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:31.888
that I would be humiliated to death,

00:10:31.912 --> 00:10:33.203
literally.

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:40.030
Today, too many parents
haven't had the chance

00:10:40.054 --> 00:10:43.047
to step in and rescue their loved ones.

00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:46.849
Too many have learned
of their child's suffering and humiliation

00:10:46.873 --> 00:10:48.862
after it was too late.

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:53.951
Tyler's tragic, senseless death
was a turning point for me.

00:10:54.485 --> 00:10:58.332
It served to recontextualize
my experiences,

00:10:58.356 --> 00:11:02.894
and I then began to look at the world
of humiliation and bullying around me

00:11:02.918 --> 00:11:04.403
and see something different.

00:11:06.593 --> 00:11:09.575
In 1998, we had no way of knowing

00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:14.379
where this brave new technology
called the internet would take us.

00:11:14.403 --> 00:11:18.491
Since then, it has connected people
in unimaginable ways --

00:11:18.515 --> 00:11:20.567
joining lost siblings,

00:11:20.591 --> 00:11:22.158
saving lives,

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.110
launching revolutions ...

00:11:25.087 --> 00:11:29.192
But the darkness, cyberbullying,
and slut-shaming that I experienced

00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:30.484
had mushroomed.

00:11:32.874 --> 00:11:37.575
Every day online, people --
especially young people,

00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:40.809
who are not developmentally
equipped to handle this --

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.187
are so abused and humiliated

00:11:43.211 --> 00:11:46.329
that they can't imagine living
to the next day.

00:11:46.353 --> 00:11:48.628
And some, tragically, don't.

00:11:49.302 --> 00:11:51.453
And there's nothing virtual about that.

00:11:52.892 --> 00:11:59.374
Childline, a UK nonprofit that's focused
on helping young people on various issues,

00:11:59.398 --> 00:12:02.470
released a staggering statistic
late last year:

00:12:03.558 --> 00:12:10.000
from 2012 to 2013,
there was an 87 percent increase

00:12:10.024 --> 00:12:13.445
in calls and e-mails
related to cyberbullying.

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:17.126
A meta-analysis
done out of the Netherlands

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.007
showed that for the first time,

00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:24.179
cyberbullying was leading
to suicidal ideations

00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:27.181
more significantly than offline bullying.

00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:31.699
And you know, what shocked me --
although it shouldn't have --

00:12:31.723 --> 00:12:33.765
was other research last year

00:12:33.789 --> 00:12:39.204
that determined humiliation
was a more intensely felt emotion

00:12:39.228 --> 00:12:42.704
than either happiness or even anger.

00:12:44.371 --> 00:12:47.022
Cruelty to others is nothing new.

00:12:48.006 --> 00:12:53.709
But online, technologically
enhanced shaming is amplified,

00:12:53.733 --> 00:12:55.301
uncontained

00:12:55.325 --> 00:12:57.420
and permanently accessible.

00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:04.765
The echo of embarrassment used to extend
only as far as your family, village,

00:13:04.789 --> 00:13:06.451
school or community.

00:13:06.998 --> 00:13:10.080
But now, it's the online community too.

00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:15.312
Millions of people, often anonymously,
can stab you with their words,

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:17.028
and that's a lot of pain.

00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:22.918
And there are no perimeters around
how many people can publicly observe you

00:13:22.942 --> 00:13:25.529
and put you in a public stockade.

00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:32.160
There is a very personal price
to public humiliation,

00:13:33.239 --> 00:13:37.017
and the growth of the internet
has jacked up that price.

00:13:40.045 --> 00:13:41.954
For nearly two decades now,

00:13:41.978 --> 00:13:46.734
we have slowly been sowing the seeds
of shame and public humiliation

00:13:46.758 --> 00:13:50.592
in our cultural soil,
both on- and offline.

00:13:51.968 --> 00:13:56.962
Gossip websites, paparazzi,
reality programming, politics,

00:13:56.986 --> 00:14:00.084
news outlets and sometimes hackers

00:14:00.108 --> 00:14:02.375
all traffic in shame.

00:14:02.837 --> 00:14:07.371
It's led to desensitization
and a permissive environment online,

00:14:07.395 --> 00:14:12.119
which lends itself to trolling,
invasion of privacy and cyberbullying.

00:14:13.217 --> 00:14:17.282
This shift has created
what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls

00:14:17.306 --> 00:14:19.750
"a culture of humiliation."

00:14:20.836 --> 00:14:25.161
Consider a few prominent examples
just from the past six months alone.

00:14:26.015 --> 00:14:31.076
Snapchat, the service which is used
mainly by younger generations

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.650
and claims that its messages
only have the life span of a few seconds.

00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:38.434
You can imagine the range
of content that that gets.

00:14:39.026 --> 00:14:44.626
A third-party app which Snapchatters use
to preserve the life span of the messages

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.143
was hacked,

00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:52.693
and 100,000 personal conversations,
photos and videos were leaked online,

00:14:52.717 --> 00:14:55.915
to now have a life span of forever.

00:14:56.983 --> 00:15:01.171
Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors
had their iCloud accounts hacked,

00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:05.119
and private, intimate, nude photos
were plastered across the internet

00:15:05.143 --> 00:15:06.844
without their permission.

00:15:06.868 --> 00:15:11.306
One gossip website
had over five million hits

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.913
for this one story.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.369
And what about
the Sony Pictures cyberhacking?

00:15:18.422 --> 00:15:21.499
The documents which received
the most attention

00:15:21.523 --> 00:15:26.131
were private e-mails that had
maximum public embarrassment value.

00:15:28.146 --> 00:15:30.502
But in this culture of humiliation,

00:15:30.526 --> 00:15:34.586
there is another kind of price tag
attached to public shaming.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.563
The price does not measure
the cost to the victim,

00:15:38.587 --> 00:15:40.930
which Tyler and too many others --

00:15:40.954 --> 00:15:45.888
notably, women, minorities
and members of the LGBTQ community --

00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:47.079
have paid,

00:15:47.103 --> 00:15:51.659
but the price measures the profit
of those who prey on them.

00:15:53.196 --> 00:15:56.662
This invasion of others is a raw material,

00:15:56.686 --> 00:16:02.630
efficiently and ruthlessly mined,
packaged and sold at a profit.

00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:09.096
A marketplace has emerged
where public humiliation is a commodity,

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.356
and shame is an industry.

00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:14.706
How is the money made?

00:16:15.699 --> 00:16:16.859
Clicks.

00:16:17.493 --> 00:16:19.819
The more shame, the more clicks.

00:16:19.843 --> 00:16:23.223
The more clicks,
the more advertising dollars.

00:16:25.428 --> 00:16:27.287
We're in a dangerous cycle.

00:16:27.914 --> 00:16:30.534
The more we click on this kind of gossip,

00:16:30.558 --> 00:16:33.487
the more numb we get
to the human lives behind it.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.266
And the more numb we get,
the more we click.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.699
All the while,

00:16:40.723 --> 00:16:44.895
someone is making money off of the back
of someone else's suffering.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.334
With every click, we make a choice.

00:16:49.358 --> 00:16:52.839
The more we saturate our culture
with public shaming,

00:16:52.863 --> 00:16:54.770
the more accepted it is,

00:16:54.794 --> 00:16:59.109
the more we will see behavior
like cyberbullying, trolling,

00:16:59.133 --> 00:17:01.098
some forms of hacking

00:17:01.122 --> 00:17:02.765
and online harassment.

00:17:03.443 --> 00:17:08.874
Why? Because they all have
humiliation at their cores.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:15.503
This behavior is a symptom
of the culture we've created.

00:17:15.527 --> 00:17:16.843
Just think about it.

00:17:18.993 --> 00:17:22.034
Changing behavior begins
with evolving beliefs.

00:17:22.772 --> 00:17:25.943
We've seen that to be true
with racism, homophobia

00:17:25.967 --> 00:17:27.838
and plenty of other biases,

00:17:27.862 --> 00:17:29.633
today and in the past.

00:17:30.695 --> 00:17:33.719
As we've changed beliefs
about same-sex marriage,

00:17:33.743 --> 00:17:37.108
more people have been offered
equal freedoms.

00:17:37.978 --> 00:17:40.764
When we began valuing sustainability,

00:17:40.788 --> 00:17:42.827
more people began to recycle.

00:17:43.434 --> 00:17:46.932
So as far as our culture
of humiliation goes,

00:17:46.956 --> 00:17:49.603
what we need is a cultural revolution.

00:17:50.481 --> 00:17:54.250
Public shaming
as a blood sport has to stop,

00:17:54.274 --> 00:17:58.339
and it's time for an intervention
on the internet and in our culture.

00:17:59.202 --> 00:18:01.642
The shift begins with something simple,

00:18:01.666 --> 00:18:03.010
but it's not easy.

00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:08.443
We need to return to a long-held
value of compassion,

00:18:08.467 --> 00:18:10.420
compassion and empathy.

00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:13.790
Online, we've got a compassion deficit,

00:18:13.814 --> 00:18:15.603
an empathy crisis.

00:18:17.413 --> 00:18:20.779
Researcher Brené Brown said, and I quote,

00:18:20.803 --> 00:18:23.329
"Shame can't survive empathy."

00:18:24.305 --> 00:18:28.669
Shame cannot survive empathy.

00:18:30.515 --> 00:18:33.308
I've seen some very dark days in my life.

00:18:34.221 --> 00:18:40.089
It was the compassion and empathy
from my family, friends, professionals

00:18:41.002 --> 00:18:42.742
and sometimes even strangers

00:18:42.766 --> 00:18:44.305
that saved me.

00:18:45.345 --> 00:18:48.536
Even empathy from one person
can make a difference.

00:18:50.369 --> 00:18:52.733
The theory of minority influence,

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:56.171
proposed by social psychologist
Serge Moscovici,

00:18:56.195 --> 00:18:58.801
says that even in small numbers,

00:18:58.825 --> 00:19:01.001
when there's consistency over time,

00:19:01.025 --> 00:19:02.575
change can happen.

00:19:03.794 --> 00:19:07.037
In the online world,
we can foster minority influence

00:19:07.061 --> 00:19:08.849
by becoming upstanders.

00:19:09.353 --> 00:19:13.150
To become an upstander means
instead of bystander apathy,

00:19:13.174 --> 00:19:17.764
we can post a positive comment for someone
or report a bullying situation.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.461
Trust me, compassionate comments
help abate the negativity.

00:19:23.202 --> 00:19:27.073
We can also counteract the culture
by supporting organizations

00:19:27.097 --> 00:19:29.174
that deal with these kinds of issues,

00:19:29.198 --> 00:19:31.982
like the Tyler Clementi
Foundation in the US;

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.413
in the UK, there's Anti-Bullying Pro;

00:19:35.437 --> 00:19:38.099
and in Australia, there's PROJECT ROCKIT.

00:19:40.206 --> 00:19:45.532
We talk a lot about our right
to freedom of expression.

00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:49.410
But we need to talk more
about our responsibility

00:19:49.434 --> 00:19:51.186
to freedom of expression.

00:19:52.051 --> 00:19:54.296
We all want to be heard,

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.080
but let's acknowledge the difference
between speaking up with intention

00:19:59.104 --> 00:20:01.856
and speaking up for attention.

00:20:03.493 --> 00:20:06.478
The internet is
the superhighway for the id.

00:20:07.597 --> 00:20:12.255
But online, showing empathy
to others benefits us all

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:15.181
and helps create a safer and better world.

00:20:15.905 --> 00:20:18.957
We need to communicate
online with compassion,

00:20:18.981 --> 00:20:21.311
consume news with compassion

00:20:21.335 --> 00:20:23.409
and click with compassion.

00:20:24.114 --> 00:20:28.261
Just imagine walking a mile
in someone else's headline.

00:20:31.261 --> 00:20:34.246
I'd like to end on a personal note.

00:20:35.561 --> 00:20:37.365
In the past nine months,

00:20:37.389 --> 00:20:40.762
the question I've been
asked the most is "Why?"

00:20:40.786 --> 00:20:41.946
Why now?

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.524
Why was I sticking my head
above the parapet?

00:20:45.193 --> 00:20:47.806
You can read between the lines
in those questions,

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.587
and the answer has nothing
to do with politics.

00:20:51.471 --> 00:20:56.306
The top-note answer was and is
"Because it's time."

00:20:57.166 --> 00:21:00.007
Time to stop tiptoeing around my past,

00:21:00.031 --> 00:21:03.021
time to stop living a life of opprobrium

00:21:03.045 --> 00:21:05.430
and time to take back my narrative.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.210
It's also not just about saving myself.

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:14.649
Anyone who is suffering from shame
and public humiliation

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:16.446
needs to know one thing:

00:21:17.446 --> 00:21:19.169
You can survive it.

00:21:20.016 --> 00:21:21.416
I know it's hard.

00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:26.085
It may not be painless, quick or easy,

00:21:26.109 --> 00:21:30.041
but you can insist
on a different ending to your story.

00:21:30.942 --> 00:21:32.980
Have compassion for yourself.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.542
We all deserve compassion

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:42.751
and to live both online and off
in a more compassionate world.

00:21:43.684 --> 00:21:45.181
Thank you for listening.

00:21:45.205 --> 00:21:52.077
(Applause and cheers)
