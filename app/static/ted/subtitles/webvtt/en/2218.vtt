00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:06.104
Let me show you something.

00:00:06.104 --> 00:00:10.260
(Video) Girl: Okay, that's a cat
sitting in a bed.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.300
The boy is petting the elephant.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.654
Those are people
that are going on an airplane.

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:21.464
That's a big airplane.

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:23.670
Fei-Fei Li: This is
a three-year-old child

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.349
describing what she sees
in a series of photos.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.194
She might still have a lot
to learn about this world,

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:34.743
but she's already an expert
at one very important task:

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.589
to make sense of what she sees.

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.455
Our society is more
technologically advanced than ever.

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:46.084
We send people to the moon,
we make phones that talk to us

00:00:46.084 --> 00:00:51.030
or customize radio stations
that can play only music we like.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.085
Yet, our most advanced
machines and computers

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:57.988
still struggle at this task.

00:00:57.988 --> 00:01:01.447
So I'm here today
to give you a progress report

00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:05.494
on the latest advances
in our research in computer vision,

00:01:05.494 --> 00:01:09.655
one of the most frontier
and potentially revolutionary

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:12.861
technologies in computer science.

00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:17.412
Yes, we have prototyped cars
that can drive by themselves,

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:21.265
but without smart vision,
they cannot really tell the difference

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:25.235
between a crumpled paper bag
on the road, which can be run over,

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:28.575
and a rock that size,
which should be avoided.

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:32.805
We have made fabulous megapixel cameras,

00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:35.940
but we have not delivered
sight to the blind.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.725
Drones can fly over massive land,

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:41.859
but don't have enough vision technology

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:45.320
to help us to track
the changes of the rainforests.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.270
Security cameras are everywhere,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.337
but they do not alert us when a child
is drowning in a swimming pool.

00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:59.762
Photos and videos are becoming
an integral part of global life.

00:01:59.762 --> 00:02:03.849
They're being generated at a pace
that's far beyond what any human,

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.632
or teams of humans, could hope to view,

00:02:06.632 --> 00:02:10.553
and you and I are contributing
to that at this TED.

00:02:10.553 --> 00:02:15.785
Yet our most advanced software
is still struggling at understanding

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.661
and managing this enormous content.

00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:24.933
So in other words,
collectively as a society,

00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:26.679
we're very much blind,

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.066
because our smartest 
machines are still blind.

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:34.452
"Why is this so hard?" you may ask.

00:02:34.452 --> 00:02:37.145
Cameras can take pictures like this one

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:41.139
by converting lights into
a two-dimensional array of numbers

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.789
known as pixels,

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.040
but these are just lifeless numbers.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.151
They do not carry meaning in themselves.

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:52.494
Just like to hear is not
the same as to listen,

00:02:52.494 --> 00:02:56.534
to take pictures is not
the same as to see,

00:02:56.534 --> 00:03:00.363
and by seeing,
we really mean understanding.

00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:07.470
In fact, it took Mother Nature
540 million years of hard work

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.443
to do this task,

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:11.324
and much of that effort

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:16.595
went into developing the visual
processing apparatus of our brains,

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:19.242
not the eyes themselves.

00:03:19.242 --> 00:03:21.989
So vision begins with the eyes,

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.507
but it truly takes place in the brain.

00:03:26.287 --> 00:03:31.347
So for 15 years now, starting
from my Ph.D. at Caltech

00:03:31.347 --> 00:03:34.273
and then leading Stanford's Vision Lab,

00:03:34.273 --> 00:03:38.669
I've been working with my mentors,
collaborators and students

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.558
to teach computers to see.

00:03:42.658 --> 00:03:45.952
Our research field is called
computer vision and machine learning.

00:03:45.952 --> 00:03:49.830
It's part of the general field
of artificial intelligence.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.493
So ultimately, we want to teach
the machines to see just like we do:

00:03:56.493 --> 00:04:01.880
naming objects, identifying people,
inferring 3D geometry of things,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.568
understanding relations, emotions,
actions and intentions.

00:04:07.568 --> 00:04:13.721
You and I weave together entire stories
of people, places and things

00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:15.885
the moment we lay our gaze on them.

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:22.538
The first step towards this goal
is to teach a computer to see objects,

00:04:22.538 --> 00:04:25.906
the building block of the visual world.

00:04:25.906 --> 00:04:30.340
In its simplest terms,
imagine this teaching process

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.335
as showing the computers
some training images

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:36.656
of a particular object, let's say cats,

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:41.393
and designing a model that learns
from these training images.

00:04:41.393 --> 00:04:43.437
How hard can this be?

00:04:43.437 --> 00:04:47.489
After all, a cat is just
a collection of shapes and colors,

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:51.575
and this is what we did
in the early days of object modeling.

00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:55.197
We'd tell the computer algorithm
in a mathematical language

00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:58.540
that a cat has a round face,
a chubby body,

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.839
two pointy ears, and a long tail,

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:02.249
and that looked all fine.

00:05:02.859 --> 00:05:04.972
But what about this cat?

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:06.063
(Laughter)

00:05:06.063 --> 00:05:07.689
It's all curled up.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:12.408
Now you have to add another shape
and viewpoint to the object model.

00:05:12.408 --> 00:05:14.123
But what if cats are hidden?

00:05:15.143 --> 00:05:17.362
What about these silly cats?

00:05:19.112 --> 00:05:21.529
Now you get my point.

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.896
Even something as simple
as a household pet

00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:29.400
can present an infinite number
of variations to the object model,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.633
and that's just one object.

00:05:32.573 --> 00:05:35.065
So about eight years ago,

00:05:35.065 --> 00:05:40.095
a very simple and profound observation
changed my thinking.

00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:44.110
No one tells a child how to see,

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.371
especially in the early years.

00:05:46.371 --> 00:05:51.371
They learn this through
real-world experiences and examples.

00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:54.111
If you consider a child's eyes

00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:56.665
as a pair of biological cameras,

00:05:56.665 --> 00:06:00.845
they take one picture
about every 200 milliseconds,

00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:03.979
the average time an eye movement is made.

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.529
So by age three, a child would have seen
hundreds of millions of pictures

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.363
of the real world.

00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:13.643
That's a lot of training examples.

00:06:14.383 --> 00:06:20.372
So instead of focusing solely
on better and better algorithms,

00:06:20.372 --> 00:06:25.644
my insight was to give the algorithms
the kind of training data

00:06:25.644 --> 00:06:28.963
that a child was given through experiences

00:06:28.963 --> 00:06:32.841
in both quantity and quality.

00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:34.699
Once we know this,

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.670
we knew we needed to collect a data set

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.129
that has far more images
than we have ever had before,

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:44.706
perhaps thousands of times more,

00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:48.817
and together with Professor
Kai Li at Princeton University,

00:06:48.817 --> 00:06:53.569
we launched the ImageNet project in 2007.

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.407
Luckily, we didn't have to mount
a camera on our head

00:06:57.407 --> 00:06:59.171
and wait for many years.

00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:00.634
We went to the Internet,

00:07:00.634 --> 00:07:05.070
the biggest treasure trove of pictures
that humans have ever created.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.111
We downloaded nearly a billion images

00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:13.991
and used crowdsourcing technology
like the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform

00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:16.330
to help us to label these images.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.230
At its peak, ImageNet was one of
the biggest employers

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.226
of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers:

00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:28.080
together, almost 50,000 workers

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.120
from 167 countries around the world

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.067
helped us to clean, sort and label

00:07:36.067 --> 00:07:39.642
nearly a billion candidate images.

00:07:40.612 --> 00:07:43.265
That was how much effort it took

00:07:43.265 --> 00:07:47.165
to capture even a fraction
of the imagery

00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:51.336
a child's mind takes in
in the early developmental years.

00:07:52.148 --> 00:07:56.050
In hindsight, this idea of using big data

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.600
to train computer algorithms
may seem obvious now,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.710
but back in 2007, it was not so obvious.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:08.588
We were fairly alone on this journey
for quite a while.

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:13.591
Some very friendly colleagues advised me
to do something more useful for my tenure,

00:08:13.591 --> 00:08:17.933
and we were constantly struggling
for research funding.

00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:20.418
Once, I even joked to my graduate students

00:08:20.418 --> 00:08:24.481
that I would just reopen
my dry cleaner's shop to fund ImageNet.

00:08:24.481 --> 00:08:29.242
After all, that's how I funded
my college years.

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:31.098
So we carried on.

00:08:31.098 --> 00:08:34.813
In 2009, the ImageNet project delivered

00:08:34.813 --> 00:08:38.855
a database of 15 million images

00:08:38.855 --> 00:08:43.660
across 22,000 classes
of objects and things

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.980
organized by everyday English words.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.906
In both quantity and quality,

00:08:49.906 --> 00:08:52.878
this was an unprecedented scale.

00:08:52.878 --> 00:08:56.339
As an example, in the case of cats,

00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:59.148
we have more than 62,000 cats

00:08:59.148 --> 00:09:03.258
of all kinds of looks and poses

00:09:03.258 --> 00:09:08.481
and across all species
of domestic and wild cats.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:11.825
We were thrilled
to have put together ImageNet,

00:09:11.825 --> 00:09:15.563
and we wanted the whole research world
to benefit from it,

00:09:15.563 --> 00:09:19.604
so in the TED fashion,
we opened up the entire data set

00:09:19.604 --> 00:09:23.196
to the worldwide
research community for free.

00:09:24.636 --> 00:09:28.636
(Applause)

00:09:29.416 --> 00:09:33.954
Now that we have the data
to nourish our computer brain,

00:09:33.954 --> 00:09:37.691
we're ready to come back
to the algorithms themselves.

00:09:37.691 --> 00:09:42.869
As it turned out, the wealth
of information provided by ImageNet

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:47.675
was a perfect match to a particular class
of machine learning algorithms

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:50.090
called convolutional neural network,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:55.338
pioneered by Kunihiko Fukushima,
Geoff Hinton, and Yann LeCun

00:09:55.338 --> 00:09:58.983
back in the 1970s and '80s.

00:09:58.983 --> 00:10:04.602
Just like the brain consists
of billions of highly connected neurons,

00:10:04.602 --> 00:10:08.456
a basic operating unit in a neural network

00:10:08.456 --> 00:10:10.871
is a neuron-like node.

00:10:10.871 --> 00:10:13.425
It takes input from other nodes

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:16.143
and sends output to others.

00:10:16.143 --> 00:10:20.856
Moreover, these hundreds of thousands
or even millions of nodes

00:10:20.856 --> 00:10:24.083
are organized in hierarchical layers,

00:10:24.083 --> 00:10:26.637
also similar to the brain.

00:10:26.637 --> 00:10:31.420
In a typical neural network we use
to train our object recognition model,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.601
it has 24 million nodes,

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:37.898
140 million parameters,

00:10:37.898 --> 00:10:40.661
and 15 billion connections.

00:10:40.661 --> 00:10:43.076
That's an enormous model.

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:46.977
Powered by the massive data from ImageNet

00:10:46.977 --> 00:10:52.410
and the modern CPUs and GPUs
to train such a humongous model,

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.779
the convolutional neural network

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:58.215
blossomed in a way that no one expected.

00:10:58.215 --> 00:11:00.723
It became the winning architecture

00:11:00.723 --> 00:11:06.063
to generate exciting new results
in object recognition.

00:11:06.063 --> 00:11:08.873
This is a computer telling us

00:11:08.873 --> 00:11:11.173
this picture contains a cat

00:11:11.173 --> 00:11:13.076
and where the cat is.

00:11:13.076 --> 00:11:15.188
Of course there are more things than cats,

00:11:15.188 --> 00:11:17.626
so here's a computer algorithm telling us

00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:20.900
the picture contains
a boy and a teddy bear;

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.266
a dog, a person, and a small kite
in the background;

00:11:25.266 --> 00:11:28.401
or a picture of very busy things

00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:33.045
like a man, a skateboard,
railings, a lampost, and so on.

00:11:33.045 --> 00:11:38.338
Sometimes, when the computer
is not so confident about what it sees,

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:41.774
we have taught it to be smart enough

00:11:41.774 --> 00:11:45.652
to give us a safe answer
instead of committing too much,

00:11:45.652 --> 00:11:48.463
just like we would do,

00:11:48.463 --> 00:11:53.129
but other times our computer algorithm
is remarkable at telling us

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.382
what exactly the objects are,

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:58.818
like the make, model, year of the cars.

00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:04.204
We applied this algorithm to millions
of Google Street View images

00:12:04.204 --> 00:12:07.339
across hundreds of American cities,

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:10.265
and we have learned something
really interesting:

00:12:10.265 --> 00:12:13.585
first, it confirmed our common wisdom

00:12:13.585 --> 00:12:16.875
that car prices correlate very well

00:12:16.875 --> 00:12:19.220
with household incomes.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.747
But surprisingly, car prices
also correlate well

00:12:23.747 --> 00:12:26.047
with crime rates in cities,

00:12:27.007 --> 00:12:30.970
or voting patterns by zip codes.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.266
So wait a minute. Is that it?

00:12:34.266 --> 00:12:39.419
Has the computer already matched
or even surpassed human capabilities?

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:41.557
Not so fast.

00:12:41.557 --> 00:12:46.480
So far, we have just taught
the computer to see objects.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.124
This is like a small child
learning to utter a few nouns.

00:12:51.124 --> 00:12:53.794
It's an incredible accomplishment,

00:12:53.794 --> 00:12:56.254
but it's only the first step.

00:12:56.254 --> 00:13:00.016
Soon, another developmental
milestone will be hit,

00:13:00.016 --> 00:13:03.477
and children begin
to communicate in sentences.

00:13:03.477 --> 00:13:07.701
So instead of saying
this is a cat in the picture,

00:13:07.701 --> 00:13:12.903
you already heard the little girl
telling us this is a cat lying on a bed.

00:13:12.903 --> 00:13:18.498
So to teach a computer
to see a picture and generate sentences,

00:13:18.498 --> 00:13:22.446
the marriage between big data
and machine learning algorithm

00:13:22.446 --> 00:13:24.721
has to take another step.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:28.877
Now, the computer has to learn
from both pictures

00:13:28.877 --> 00:13:31.733
as well as natural language sentences

00:13:31.733 --> 00:13:35.055
generated by humans.

00:13:35.055 --> 00:13:38.908
Just like the brain integrates
vision and language,

00:13:38.908 --> 00:13:44.109
we developed a model
that connects parts of visual things

00:13:44.109 --> 00:13:46.013
like visual snippets

00:13:46.013 --> 00:13:50.216
with words and phrases in sentences.

00:13:50.216 --> 00:13:52.979
About four months ago,

00:13:52.979 --> 00:13:55.626
we finally tied all this together

00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:59.410
and produced one of the first
computer vision models

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.404
that is capable of generating
a human-like sentence

00:14:03.404 --> 00:14:06.910
when it sees a picture for the first time.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.554
Now, I'm ready to show you
what the computer says

00:14:11.554 --> 00:14:13.529
when it sees the picture

00:14:13.529 --> 00:14:17.359
that the little girl saw
at the beginning of this talk.

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:22.863
(Video) Computer: A man is standing
next to an elephant.

00:14:24.393 --> 00:14:28.027
A large airplane sitting on top
of an airport runway.

00:14:29.057 --> 00:14:33.269
FFL: Of course, we're still working hard
to improve our algorithms,

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:35.865
and it still has a lot to learn.

00:14:35.865 --> 00:14:38.156
(Applause)

00:14:39.556 --> 00:14:42.877
And the computer still makes mistakes.

00:14:42.877 --> 00:14:46.268
(Video) Computer: A cat lying
on a bed in a blanket.

00:14:46.268 --> 00:14:48.821
FFL: So of course, when it sees
too many cats,

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:51.747
it thinks everything
might look like a cat.

00:14:53.317 --> 00:14:56.181
(Video) Computer: A young boy
is holding a baseball bat.

00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:57.946
(Laughter)

00:14:57.946 --> 00:15:02.529
FFL: Or, if it hasn't seen a toothbrush,
it confuses it with a baseball bat.

00:15:03.309 --> 00:15:06.743
(Video) Computer: A man riding a horse
down a street next to a building.

00:15:06.743 --> 00:15:08.766
(Laughter)

00:15:08.766 --> 00:15:12.318
FFL: We haven't taught Art 101
to the computers.

00:15:13.768 --> 00:15:16.652
(Video) Computer: A zebra standing
in a field of grass.

00:15:16.652 --> 00:15:20.019
FFL: And it hasn't learned to appreciate
the stunning beauty of nature

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:22.457
like you and I do.

00:15:22.457 --> 00:15:25.289
So it has been a long journey.

00:15:25.289 --> 00:15:29.515
To get from age zero to three was hard.

00:15:29.515 --> 00:15:35.111
The real challenge is to go
from three to 13 and far beyond.

00:15:35.111 --> 00:15:39.476
Let me remind you with this picture
of the boy and the cake again.

00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:43.540
So far, we have taught
the computer to see objects

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.998
or even tell us a simple story
when seeing a picture.

00:15:47.998 --> 00:15:51.574
(Video) Computer: A person sitting
at a table with a cake.

00:15:51.574 --> 00:15:54.204
FFL: But there's so much more 
to this picture

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:56.474
than just a person and a cake.

00:15:56.474 --> 00:16:00.941
What the computer doesn't see
is that this is a special Italian cake

00:16:00.941 --> 00:16:04.158
that's only served during Easter time.

00:16:04.158 --> 00:16:07.363
The boy is wearing his favorite t-shirt

00:16:07.363 --> 00:16:11.333
given to him as a gift by his father
after a trip to Sydney,

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:15.141
and you and I can all tell how happy he is

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.344
and what's exactly on his mind
at that moment.

00:16:19.214 --> 00:16:22.339
This is my son Leo.

00:16:22.339 --> 00:16:24.963
On my quest for visual intelligence,

00:16:24.963 --> 00:16:27.354
I think of Leo constantly

00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:30.257
and the future world he will live in.

00:16:30.257 --> 00:16:32.278
When machines can see,

00:16:32.278 --> 00:16:36.990
doctors and nurses will have
extra pairs of tireless eyes

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.082
to help them to diagnose
and take care of patients.

00:16:41.082 --> 00:16:45.465
Cars will run smarter
and safer on the road.

00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:48.159
Robots, not just humans,

00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:53.008
will help us to brave the disaster zones
to save the trapped and wounded.

00:16:53.798 --> 00:16:57.594
We will discover new species, 
better materials,

00:16:57.594 --> 00:17:02.103
and explore unseen frontiers
with the help of the machines.

00:17:03.113 --> 00:17:07.280
Little by little, we're giving sight
to the machines.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.078
First, we teach them to see.

00:17:10.078 --> 00:17:12.841
Then, they help us to see better.

00:17:12.841 --> 00:17:17.006
For the first time, human eyes
won't be the only ones

00:17:17.006 --> 00:17:19.940
pondering and exploring our world.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.400
We will not only use the machines
for their intelligence,

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:29.579
we will also collaborate with them
in ways that we cannot even imagine.

00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:31.740
This is my quest:

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.452
to give computers visual intelligence

00:17:34.452 --> 00:17:39.583
and to create a better future
for Leo and for the world.

00:17:39.583 --> 00:17:41.394
Thank you.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:45.179
(Applause)
