00:00:00.884 --> 00:00:06.343
"Where are you from?"
said the pale, tattooed man.

00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:11.103
"Where are you from?"

00:00:12.453 --> 00:00:15.493
It's September 21, 2001,

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:21.615
10 days after the worst attack
on America since World War II.

00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:26.940
Everyone wonders about the next plane.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.682
People are looking for scapegoats.

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:34.490
The president, 
the night before, pledges to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.744
"bring our enemies to justice 
or bring justice to our enemies."

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:46.493
And in the Dallas mini-mart,

00:00:46.493 --> 00:00:52.266
a Dallas mini-part surrounded
by tire shops and strip joints

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:56.273
a Bangladeshi immigrant 
works the register.

00:00:56.273 --> 00:01:03.315
Back home, Raisuddin Bhuiyan
was a big man, an Air Force officer.

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:06.919
But he dreamed of a 
fresh start in America.

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:12.217
If he had to work briefly in a mini-mart
to save up for I.T. classes

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:14.805
and his wedding in two months, so be it.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:20.785
Then, on September 21, 
that tattooed man enters the mart.

00:01:20.785 --> 00:01:23.046
He holds a shotgun.

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:26.159
Raisuddin knows the drill:

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.828
puts cash on the counter.

00:01:30.058 --> 00:01:34.519
This time, the man doesn't 
touch the money.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:38.990
"Where are you from?" he asks.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.192
"Excuse me?" Raisuddin answers.

00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:48.317
His accent betrays him.

00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:53.334
The tattooed man, a self-styled
true American vigilante,

00:01:53.334 --> 00:01:58.083
shoots Raisuddin in revenge for 9/11.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:02.732
Raisuddin feels millions of bees
stinging his face.

00:02:03.982 --> 00:02:10.279
In fact, dozens of scalding, 
birdshot pellets puncture his head.

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.859
Behind the counter, he lays in blood.

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:18.350
He cups a hand over his forehead
to keep in the brains

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.128
on which he'd gambled everything.

00:02:22.298 --> 00:02:28.857
He recites verses from the Koran,
begging his God to live.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:33.172
He senses he is dying.

00:02:33.172 --> 00:02:35.690
He didn't die.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.006
His right eye left him.

00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:42.591
His fiancÃ©e left him.

00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:46.691
His landlord, the mini-mart owner,
kicked him out.

00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:52.004
Soon he was homeless and 
60,000 dollars in medical debt,

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:56.206
including a fee for dialing 
for an ambulance.

00:02:57.996 --> 00:03:00.458
But Raisuddin lived.

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:06.453
And years later, he would ask
what he could do to repay his God

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:09.212
and become worthy of this second chance.

00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:11.883
He would come to believe, in fact,

00:03:11.883 --> 00:03:17.611
that this chance called for him
to give a second chance

00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:22.184
to a man we might think
deserved no chance at all.

00:03:23.544 --> 00:03:29.632
Twelve years ago, I was a fresh graduate
seeking my way in the world.

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:32.132
Born in Ohio to Indian immigrants,


00:03:32.132 --> 00:03:35.399
I settled on the ultimate rebellion 
against my parents,

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:40.429
moving to the country they had worked
so damn hard to get out of.

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:46.020
What I thought might be a six-month stint
in Mumbai stretched to six years.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.665
I became a writer and found myself
amid a magical story:

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:55.182
the awakening of hope across much
of the so-called Third World.

00:03:55.182 --> 00:04:00.238
Six years ago, I returned to America
and realized something:

00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:03.302
The American Dream was thriving,

00:04:03.302 --> 00:04:06.825
but only in India.

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:10.270
In America, not so much.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.093
In fact, I observed that 
America was fracturing

00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:16.327
into two distinct societies:

00:04:16.327 --> 00:04:20.966
a republic of dreams
and a republic of fears.

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:24.317
And then, I stumbled onto this 
incredible tale of two lives

00:04:24.317 --> 00:04:31.640
and of these two Americas that brutally
collided in that Dallas mini-mart.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.041
I knew at once I wanted to learn more,

00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:36.812
and eventually that I would write
a book about them,

00:04:36.812 --> 00:04:40.694
for their story was the story 
of America's fracturing

00:04:40.694 --> 00:04:46.280
and of how it might be put back together.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.260
After he was shot, Raisuddin's life
grew no easier.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.960
The day after admitting him,
the hospital discharged him.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.938
His right eye couldn't see.

00:04:56.938 --> 00:04:58.546
He couldn't speak.

00:04:58.546 --> 00:05:01.665
Metal peppered his face.

00:05:01.665 --> 00:05:05.846
But he had no insurance, 
so they bounced him.

00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:09.970
His family in Bangladesh 
begged him, "Come home."

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.228
But he told them he had 
a dream to see about.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.699
He found telemarketing work,

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.974
then he became an Olive Garden waiter,

00:05:20.974 --> 00:05:25.094
because where better to get over his fear
of white people than the Olive Garden?

00:05:25.094 --> 00:05:28.434
(Laughter)

00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:32.991
Now, as a devout Muslim,
he refused alcohol,

00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:35.188
didn't touch the stuff.

00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:40.215
Then he learned that not selling it
would slash his pay.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:44.006
So he reasoned, like a budding 
American pragmatist,

00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:48.138
"Well, God wouldn't want me
to starve, would he?"

00:05:48.138 --> 00:05:51.406
And before long, in some months, 
Raisuddin was that Olive Garden's

00:05:51.406 --> 00:05:55.477
highest grossing alcohol pusher.

00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:59.364
He found a man who taught him
database administration.

00:05:59.364 --> 00:06:01.486
He got part-time I.T. gigs.

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:06.718
Eventually, he landed a six-figure job
at a blue chip tech company in Dallas.

00:06:08.048 --> 00:06:12.816
But as America began
to work for Raisuddin,

00:06:12.816 --> 00:06:16.853
he avoided the classic
error of the fortunate:

00:06:16.853 --> 00:06:20.777
assuming you're the rule, 
not the exception.

00:06:20.777 --> 00:06:26.576
In fact, he observed that many with
the fortune of being born American

00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:33.298
were nonetheless trapped in lives that 
made second chances like his impossible.

00:06:33.298 --> 00:06:36.729
He saw it at the Olive Garden itself,

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.239
where so many of his colleagues had
childhood horror stories

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:44.956
of family dysfunction, chaos, 
addiction, crime.

00:06:44.956 --> 00:06:49.407
He'd heard a similar tale about
the man who shot him

00:06:49.407 --> 00:06:52.059
back when he attended his trial.

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:57.789
The closer Raisuddin got to the America
he had coveted from afar,

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:01.973
the more he realized there was
another, equally real, America

00:07:01.973 --> 00:07:06.295
that was stingier with second chances.

00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:13.890
The man who shot Raisuddin grew up
in that stingier America.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.980
From a distance, Mark Stroman
was always the spark of parties,

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.543
always making girls feel pretty.

00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:27.139
Always working, no matter what 
drugs or fights he'd had the night before.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.244
But he'd always wrestled with demons.

00:07:31.244 --> 00:07:33.749
He entered the world through
the three gateways

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:36.471
that doom so many young American men:

00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:41.340
bad parents, bad schools, bad prisons.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.871
His mother told him, regretfully, as a boy


00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:50.214
that she'd been just 50 dollars 
short of aborting him.

00:07:50.214 --> 00:07:56.078
Sometimes, that little boy 
would be at school,

00:07:56.078 --> 00:08:00.579
he'd suddenly pull a knife 
on his fellow classmates.

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:04.187
Sometimes that same little boy
would be at his grandparents',

00:08:04.187 --> 00:08:06.934
tenderly feeding horses.

00:08:06.934 --> 00:08:09.379
He was getting arrested before he shaved,

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:11.805
first juvenile, then prison.

00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:14.944
He became a casual white supremacist

00:08:14.944 --> 00:08:20.656
and, like so many around him, 
a drug-addled and absent father.

00:08:20.656 --> 00:08:25.564
And then, before long,
he found himself on death row,

00:08:25.564 --> 00:08:31.688
for in his 2001 counter-jihad, 
he had shot not one mini-mart clerk,

00:08:31.688 --> 00:08:33.596
but three.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.884
Only Raisuddin survived.

00:08:36.944 --> 00:08:41.808
Strangely, death row was 
the first institution

00:08:41.808 --> 00:08:45.341
that left Stroman better.

00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:47.569
His old influences quit him.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:51.225
The people entering his life 
were virtuous and caring:

00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:55.989
pastors, journalists, European pen-pals.

00:08:55.989 --> 00:09:02.282
They listened to him, prayed with him,
helped him question himself.

00:09:02.282 --> 00:09:07.428
And sent him on a journey 
of introspection and betterment.

00:09:07.428 --> 00:09:12.362
He finally faced the hatred 
that had defined his life.

00:09:12.362 --> 00:09:15.253
He read Viktor Frankl, 
the Holocaust survivor

00:09:15.253 --> 00:09:18.633
and regretted his swastika tattoos.

00:09:18.633 --> 00:09:20.925
He found God.

00:09:20.925 --> 00:09:25.152
Then one day in 2011, 
10 years after his crimes,

00:09:25.152 --> 00:09:27.591
Stroman received news.

00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:35.384
One of the men he'd shot, the survivor,
was fighting to save his life.

00:09:35.384 --> 00:09:41.173
You see, late in 2009,
eight years after that shooting,

00:09:41.173 --> 00:09:47.196
Raisuddin had gone on his own journey,
a pilgrimage to Mecca.

00:09:47.196 --> 00:09:51.450
Amid its crowds, 
he felt immense gratitude,

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.245
but also duty.

00:09:53.245 --> 00:09:57.034
He recalled promising God, 
as he lay dying in 2001,

00:09:57.034 --> 00:10:02.234
that if he lived, he would serve 
humanity all his days.

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:07.529
Then, he'd gotten busy 
relaying the bricks of a life.

00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:10.912
Now it was time to pay his debts.

00:10:11.982 --> 00:10:15.872
And he decided, upon reflection,
that his method of payment

00:10:15.872 --> 00:10:19.135
would be an intervention 
in the cycle of vengeance

00:10:19.135 --> 00:10:21.994
between the Muslim and Western worlds.

00:10:21.994 --> 00:10:24.689
And how would he intervene?

00:10:24.689 --> 00:10:28.991
By forgiving Stroman publicly
in the name of Islam

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:30.731
and its doctrine of mercy.

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:37.292
And then suing the state of Texas
and its governor Rick Perry

00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:40.997
to prevent them from executing Stroman,

00:10:40.997 --> 00:10:44.111
exactly like most people 
shot in the face do.

00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:46.475
(Laughter)

00:10:46.475 --> 00:10:53.701
Yet Raisuddin's mercy was inspired 
not only by faith.

00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:59.759
A newly minted American citizen,
he had come to believe that Stroman

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:06.739
was the product of a hurting America that
couldn't just be lethally injected away.

00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:11.204
That insight is what moved me 
to write my book "The True American."

00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:15.851
This immigrant begging America 
to be as merciful to a native son

00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:19.608
as it had been to an adopted one.

00:11:20.768 --> 00:11:23.621
In the mini-mart, all those years earlier,

00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:28.047
not just two men, 
but two Americas collided.

00:11:28.047 --> 00:11:30.968
An America that still dreams, 
still strives,

00:11:30.968 --> 00:11:35.047
still imagines that tomorrow
can build on today,

00:11:35.047 --> 00:11:38.146
and an America that has resigned to fate,

00:11:38.146 --> 00:11:41.280
buckled under stress and chaos,
lowered expectations,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.418
an ducked into the oldest of refuges:

00:11:44.418 --> 00:11:48.218
the tribal fellowship of one's
own narrow kind.

00:11:48.218 --> 00:11:50.888
And it was Raisuddin, despite
being a newcomer,

00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:52.215
despite being attacked,


00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:55.088
despite being homeless and traumatized,

00:11:55.088 --> 00:11:58.492
who belonged to that republic of dreams

00:11:58.492 --> 00:12:03.103
and Stroman who belonged to that 
other wounded country,

00:12:03.103 --> 00:12:08.418
despite being born with the privilege
of a native white man.

00:12:08.418 --> 00:12:14.704
I realized these men's stories formed
an urgent parable about America.

00:12:14.704 --> 00:12:18.723
The country I am so proud to call my own

00:12:18.723 --> 00:12:22.589
wasn't living through a 
generalized decline

00:12:22.589 --> 00:12:29.683
as seen in Spain or Greece, 
where prospects were dimming for everyone.

00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:34.680
America is simultaneously the most
and the least successful country

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.027
in the industrialized world.

00:12:37.027 --> 00:12:39.571
Launching the world's best companies,

00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:42.970
even as record numbers 
of children go hungry.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.125
Seeing life-expectancy drop
for large groups,

00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:50.831
even as it polishes 
the world's best hospitals.

00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:55.134
America today is a sprightly young body,

00:12:55.134 --> 00:13:00.952
hit by one of those strokes 
that sucks the life from one side,

00:13:00.952 --> 00:13:04.440
while leaving the other
worryingly perfect.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:12.056
On July 20, 2011, right after 
a sobbing Raisuddin

00:13:12.056 --> 00:13:14.355
testified in defense of Stroman's life,

00:13:14.355 --> 00:13:20.679
Stroman was killed by lethal injection
by the state he so loved.

00:13:20.679 --> 00:13:25.232
Hours earlier, when Raisuddin still
thought he could still save Stroman,

00:13:25.232 --> 00:13:28.200
the two men got to speak 
for the second time ever.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.592
Here is an excerpt from their phone call.

00:13:31.592 --> 00:13:37.450
Raisuddin: "Mark, you should know 
that I am praying for God,

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.493
the most compassionate and gracious.

00:13:40.493 --> 00:13:42.961
I forgive you and I do not hate you.

00:13:42.961 --> 00:13:45.952
I never hated you."

00:13:45.952 --> 00:13:50.396
Stroman: "You are a remarkable person.

00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:52.513
Thank you from my heart.

00:13:52.513 --> 00:13:55.400
I love you, bro."

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.318
Even more amazingly, after the execution,


00:13:59.318 --> 00:14:03.530
Raisuddin reached out to Stroman's 
eldest daughter, Amber,

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.273
an ex-convinct and an addict.

00:14:06.273 --> 00:14:08.060
and offered his help.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.058
"You may have lost a father,"
he told her,

00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:14.600
"but you've gained an uncle."

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:20.483
He wanted her, too, to have 
a second chance.

00:14:20.483 --> 00:14:25.618
If human history were a parade,

00:14:25.618 --> 00:14:32.325
America's float would be 
a neon shrine to second chances.

00:14:32.325 --> 00:14:38.025
But America, generous with second chances
to the children of other lands,

00:14:38.025 --> 00:14:44.241
today grows miserly with first chances
to the children of its own.

00:14:44.241 --> 00:14:49.168
America still dazzles at allowing
anybody to become an American.

00:14:49.168 --> 00:14:55.811
But it is losing its luster at allowing
every American to become a somebody.

00:14:55.811 --> 00:15:00.583
Over the last decade, seven million
foreigners gained American citizenship.

00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:02.607
Remarkable.

00:15:02.607 --> 00:15:07.912
In the meanwhile, how many Americans
gained a place in the middle class?

00:15:07.912 --> 00:15:11.682
Actually, the net influx was negative.

00:15:11.682 --> 00:15:13.981
Go back further, 
and it's even more striking:

00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:19.212
Since the 60s, the middle class
has shrunk by 20 percent,

00:15:19.212 --> 00:15:22.564
mainly because of the people
tumbling out of it.

00:15:22.564 --> 00:15:26.226
And my reporting around the country
tells me the problem is grimmer

00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:28.639
than simple inequality.

00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:34.574
What I observe is a pair of secessions
from the unifying center of American life.

00:15:34.574 --> 00:15:38.102
An affluent secession of up, up and away,

00:15:38.102 --> 00:15:41.534
into elite enclaves of the educated
and into a global matrix

00:15:41.534 --> 00:15:44.317
of work, money and connections,

00:15:44.317 --> 00:15:48.415
and an impoverished secession 
of down and out

00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:51.159
into disconnected, dead-end lives

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:55.183
that the fortunate scarcely see.

00:15:55.183 --> 00:16:00.468
And don't console yourself 
that you are the 99 percent.

00:16:01.918 --> 00:16:06.504
If you live near a Whole Foods,

00:16:06.504 --> 00:16:10.167
if no one in your family serves 
in the military,

00:16:10.167 --> 00:16:15.386
if you're paid by the year,
not the hour,

00:16:15.386 --> 00:16:18.783
if most people you know finished college,

00:16:18.783 --> 00:16:21.105
if no one you know uses meth,

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:23.285
if you married once and remain married,

00:16:23.285 --> 00:16:27.627
if you're not one of 65 million Americans
with a criminal record --

00:16:27.627 --> 00:16:31.409
if any or all of these things 
describe you,

00:16:31.409 --> 00:16:34.276
then accept the possibility that actually,

00:16:34.276 --> 00:16:36.699
you may not know what's going on

00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:42.588
and you may be part of the problem.

00:16:42.588 --> 00:16:48.576
Other generations had to build 
a fresh society after slavery,

00:16:48.576 --> 00:16:52.840
pull through a depression,
defeat fascism,

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.569
freedom-ride in Mississippi.

00:16:55.569 --> 00:16:58.096
The moral challenge of 
my generation, I believe,

00:16:58.096 --> 00:17:01.213
is to reacquaint these two Americas,

00:17:01.213 --> 00:17:06.392
to choose union over secession once again.

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:10.337
This ins't a problem we can tax
or tax-cut away.

00:17:10.337 --> 00:17:14.527
It won't be solved by tweeting harder,
building slicker apps,

00:17:14.527 --> 00:17:18.965
or starting one more 
artisanal coffee roasting service.

00:17:18.965 --> 00:17:25.232
It is a moral challenge that begs 
each of us in the flourishing America

00:17:25.232 --> 00:17:29.327
to take on the wilting America as our own,

00:17:29.327 --> 00:17:32.342
as Raisuddin tried to do.

00:17:32.342 --> 00:17:34.923
Like him, we can make pilgrimages.

00:17:34.923 --> 00:17:38.446
And there, in Baltimore and Oregon 
and Appalachia,

00:17:38.446 --> 00:17:40.938
find new purpose, as he did.

00:17:40.938 --> 00:17:44.197
We can immerse ourselves 
in that other country,

00:17:44.197 --> 00:17:47.974
bear witness to its hopes and sorrows,

00:17:47.974 --> 00:17:54.829
and, like Raisuddin, ask what we can do.

00:17:54.829 --> 00:17:57.955
What can you do?

00:17:57.955 --> 00:17:59.706
What can you do?

00:17:59.706 --> 00:18:01.679
What can we do?

00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:06.726
How might we build 
a more merciful country?

00:18:06.726 --> 00:18:10.933
We, the greatest inventors in the world,


00:18:10.933 --> 00:18:15.948
can invent solutions to the problems 
of that America, not only our own.

00:18:15.948 --> 00:18:19.350
We, the writers and the journalists, 
can cover that America's stories,

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.946
instead of shutting down 
bureaus in its midst.

00:18:22.946 --> 00:18:26.190
We can finance that America's ideas,

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.405
instead of ideas from New York 
and San Francisco.

00:18:29.405 --> 00:18:32.250
We can put our stethoscopes to its backs,

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:38.475
teach there, go to court there,
make there, live there, pray there.

00:18:38.475 --> 00:18:43.272
This, I believe, is the calling 
of a generation.

00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:46.758
An America whose two halves learn again


00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:52.404
to stride, to plow, to forge,
to dare together.

00:18:54.374 --> 00:19:00.099
A republic of chances, rewoven, renewed,

00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:03.777
begins with us.

00:19:03.777 --> 00:19:05.616
Thank you.

00:19:05.616 --> 00:19:10.563
(Applause)
