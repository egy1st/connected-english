♫ Jill Sobule: At a conference in Monterey by the big, big jellyfish tank, ♫

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
♫ I first saw you and I got so shy. ♫

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
♫ You see, I was a little paranoid 'cause I might have been high. ♫

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
♫ And I hadn't done that in ages and I won't do that again. ♫

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
♫ But that's another story. ♫

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
♫ Loved you forever and I've been a big fan, ♫

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
♫ the one-woman shows, I even rented "Pat." ♫

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
♫ I got enough nerve to come up to you, ♫

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
♫ but little did I know one year later we'd be doing this show. ♫

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
♫ I sing. Julia Sweeney: I tell stories. Together: The Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ Sobule: Sometimes it works. Sweeney: Sometimes it doesn't. ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
♫ Together: The Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
♫ Sweeney: At a conference in Monterey next to the big, big jellyfish tank, ♫

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
♫ I first saw you and I wasn't so shy. ♫

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan I was

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
ever since I was writing that pilot for Fox, and Wendy

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and I wanted you to do the theme song.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And then the pilot didn't go and I was so sad,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but I kept remaining a fan of yours.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And then when I went through that big, horrible breakup with Carl

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and I couldn't get off the couch, I listened to your song,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
♫ "Now That I Don't Have You," ♫ over and over and over and over again.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And I can't believe you're here and that I'm meeting you here at TED.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And also, I can't believe that we're eating sushi

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in front of the fish tank,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
which, personally, I think is really inappropriate.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
(Applause)

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And little did I know that one year later ... ♫ we'd be doing this show. ♫

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
♫ Sobule: I sing. Sweeney: I tell stories. Together: The Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Sobule: Hey, they asked us back! Sweeney: Can you stand it?!

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
♫ Together: The Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
♫ Sobule: Why are all our heroes so imperfect? ♫

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
♫ Why do they always bring me down? ♫

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
♫ Why are all our heroes so imperfect? ♫

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
♫ Statue in the park has lost his crown. ♫

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
♫ William Faulkner, drunk and depressed. ♫ Sweeney: Mmm.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
♫ Dorothy Parker, mean, drunk and depressed. ♫ Sweeney: I know.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
♫ And that guy, "Seven Years in Tibet," turned out to be a Nazi. ♫ Sweeney: Yeah.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
♫ Founding fathers all had slaves. ♫ Sweeney: I know.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
♫ The explorers slaughtered the braves. ♫ Sweeney: Horribly.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
♫ Sobule: The Old Testament God can be so petty. ♫

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Sweeney: Don't get me started on that. (Laughter)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
♫ Sobule: Paul McCartney, jealous of John, even more so now that he's gone. ♫

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
♫ Dylan was so mean to Donovan in that movie. ♫

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
♫ Pablo Picasso, cruel to his wives. ♫ Sweeney: Horrible.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
♫ Sobule: My favorite poets took their own lives. ♫

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
♫ Orson Welles peaked at twenty-five, below before our eyes. ♫

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
♫ And he sold bad wine. ♫

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
♫ Together: Why are all our heroes so imperfect? Yeah ♫

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
♫ Why do they always bring me down? ♫

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
♫ Sobule: Heard Babe Ruth was full of malice. ♫ Sweeney: Oh.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
♫ Lewis Carroll I'm sure did Alice. ♫ Sweeney: What?!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
♫ Plato in the cave with those very young boys. ♫ Sweeney: Ooh...

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
♫ Sobule: Hillary supported the war. ♫

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
♫ Sweeney: Even Thomas Friedman supported the war. ♫ (Laughter)

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
♫ Sobule: Colin Powell turned out to be ... Together: ... such a pussy. ♫ (Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
♫ Sobule: William Faulkner, drunk and depressed, ♫

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
♫ Tennessee Williams, drunk and depressed. ♫ Sweeney: Yeah.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
♫ Sobule: Take it, Julia. ♫

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Sweeney: Okay. Oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I mean, I watch Oprah mostly when I'm home in Spokane

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
visiting my mother. And to my mother,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Oprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
which is actually saying something because she's a devout Catholic.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Anyway, I like Oprah -- I like her girlfriendy-ness,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I like her weight issues,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I like how she's transformed talk television,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I like how she's brought reading back to America --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
but there was something that happened the last two weeks

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
that was ... I call it the Soon-Yi moment:

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And that was that she did two entire shows

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
promoting that movie "The Secret."

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Do you guys know about that movie "The Secret"?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
It makes "What the Bleep Do We Know" seem like a doctoral dissertation

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
from Harvard on quantum mechanics -- that's how bad it is.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It makes "The DaVinci Code" seem like "War and Peace."

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
That movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And the basic idea is

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
that there's this law of attraction, and

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
your thoughts have this vibrating energy

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
that goes out into the universe

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and then you attract good things to happen to you.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
On a scientific basis, it's more than just "Power of Positive Thinking" --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
it has a horrible, horrible dark side. Like if you get ill,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
it's because you've just been thinking negative thoughts.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Yeah, stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell-Mann

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
would go on Oprah

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and just explain to her that the law of attraction is, in fact, not a law.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So that's what I have to say.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
(Laughter)

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
(Applause)

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
♫ Sobule: I sing. Sweeney: I tell stories. Together: The Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
♫ Sobule: Sometimes it works. Sweeney: Sometimes it doesn't. ♫

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
♫ Together: The Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia Show. ♫

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
(Applause)
