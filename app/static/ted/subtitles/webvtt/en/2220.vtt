00:00:02.206 --> 00:00:05.224
I'm a potter,

00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:09.749
which seems like a fairly humble vocation.

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.629
I know a lot about pots.

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.309
I've spent about 15 years making them.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.339
One of the things that really
excites me in my artistic practice

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.056
and being trained as a potter

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:27.500
is that you very quickly learn
how to make great things out of nothing;

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.283
that I spent a lot of time at my wheel
with mounds of clay trying stuff;

00:00:34.283 --> 00:00:37.775
and that the limitations
of my capacity, my ability,

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:40.506
was based on my hands and my imagination;

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.706
that if I wanted to make
a really nice bowl

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:44.810
and I didn't know how to make a foot yet,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.829
I would have to learn how to make a foot;

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.933
that that process of learning
has been very, very helpful to my life.

00:00:52.983 --> 00:00:54.957
I feel like, as a potter,

00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:59.067
you also start to learn
how to shape the world.

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:02.178
There have been times
in my artistic capacity

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:05.041
that I wanted to reflect

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.704
on other really important moments

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:11.814
in the history of the U.S.,
the history of the world

00:01:11.814 --> 00:01:13.405
where tough things happened,

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:16.086
but how do you talk about tough ideas

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:20.196
without separating people
from that content?

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:25.792
Could I use art like these old,
discontinued firehoses from Alabama,

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:31.946
to talk about the complexities of a moment
of civil rights in the '60s?

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:36.797
Is it possible to talk about my father
and I doing labor projects?

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:40.954
My dad was a roofer, construction guy,
he owned small businesses,

00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:46.470
and at 80, he was ready to retire
and his tar kettle was my inheritance.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.659
Now, a tar kettle doesn't sound
like much of an inheritance. It wasn't.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.606
It was stinky and it took up
a lot of space in my studio,

00:01:55.606 --> 00:01:59.901
but I asked my dad if he would be willing
to make some art with me,

00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.732
if we could reimagine this kind
of nothing material

00:02:03.732 --> 00:02:06.217
as something very special.

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:09.607
And by elevating the material
and my dad's skill,

00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:14.625
could we start to think about tar
just like clay, in a new way,

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:20.017
shaping it differently,
helping us to imagine what was possible?

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:25.790
After clay, I was then kind of turned on
to lots of different kinds of materials,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.762
and my studio grew a lot
because I thought, well,

00:02:28.762 --> 00:02:32.849
it's not really about the material,
it's about our capacity to shape things.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.705
I became more and more interested in ideas

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:40.537
and more and more things that 
were happening just outside my studio.

00:02:41.897 --> 00:02:45.096
Just to give you a little bit of context,
I live in Chicago.

00:02:45.104 --> 00:02:48.359
I live on the South Side now.
I'm a West Sider.

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.773
For those of you who are not Chicagoans,
that won't mean anything,

00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:54.025
but if I didn't mention
that I was a West Sider,

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:58.204
there would be a lot of people
in the city that would be very upset.

00:02:58.204 --> 00:03:01.153
The neighborhood that I live in
is Grand Crossing.

00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:04.195
It's a neighborhood
that has seen better days.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:09.071
It is not a gated community by far.

00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:12.205
There is lots of abandonment
in my neighborhood,

00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:15.711
and while I was kind of busy
making pots and busy making art

00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:17.662
and having a good art career,

00:03:17.662 --> 00:03:19.807
there was all of this stuff
that was happening

00:03:19.807 --> 00:03:21.600
just outside my studio.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.748
All of us know about
failing housing markets

00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:27.580
and the challenges of blight,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.057
and I feel like we talk about it
with some of our cities more than others,

00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:33.991
but I think a lot of our
U.S. cities and beyond

00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:36.011
have the challenge of blight,

00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:40.237
abandoned buildings that people
no longer know what to do anything with.

00:03:40.237 --> 00:03:43.093
And so I thought, is there a way
that I could start to think

00:03:43.093 --> 00:03:48.479
about these buildings as an extension
or an expansion of my artistic practice?

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.498
And that if I was thinking
along with other creatives --

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:55.166
architects, engineers,
real estate finance people --

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:58.046
that us together might be able
to kind of think

00:03:58.046 --> 00:04:01.715
in more complicated ways
about the reshaping of cities.

00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:04.733
And so I bought a building.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:07.473
The building was really affordable.

00:04:07.473 --> 00:04:09.185
We tricked it out.

00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:13.620
We made it as beautiful as we could
to try to just get some activity happening

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.872
on my block.

00:04:15.872 --> 00:04:18.310
Once I bought the building
for about 18,000 dollars,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.330
I didn't have any money left.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.509
So I started sweeping the building
as a kind of performance.

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.341
This is performance art,
and people would come over,

00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:29.897
and I would start sweeping.

00:04:29.897 --> 00:04:32.544
Because the broom was free
and sweeping was free.

00:04:32.544 --> 00:04:34.703
It worked out.

00:04:34.703 --> 00:04:36.938
(Laughter)

00:04:36.938 --> 00:04:42.389
But we would use the building, then,
to stage exhibitions, small dinners,

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.336
and we found that that building
on my block, Dorchester --

00:04:46.336 --> 00:04:49.052
we now referred to the block
as Dorchester projects --

00:04:49.052 --> 00:04:52.535
that in a way that building
became a kind of gathering site

00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:54.769
for lots of different kinds of activity.

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:59.222
We turned the building into
what we called now the Archive House.

00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:02.403
The Archive House would do
all of these amazing things.

00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:05.747
Very significant people
in the city and beyond

00:05:05.747 --> 00:05:08.422
would find themselves
in the middle of the hood.

00:05:08.422 --> 00:05:10.790
And that's when I felt like

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.602
maybe there was a relationship
between my history with clay

00:05:13.602 --> 00:05:16.172
and this new thing that was
starting to develop,

00:05:16.172 --> 00:05:18.514
that we were slowly starting

00:05:18.514 --> 00:05:22.370
to reshape how people imagined
the South Side of the city.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.622
One house turned into a few houses,

00:05:25.622 --> 00:05:28.084
and we always tried to suggest

00:05:28.084 --> 00:05:32.008
that not only is creating
a beautiful vessel important,

00:05:32.008 --> 00:05:35.884
but the contents of what happens
in those buildings is also very important.

00:05:35.884 --> 00:05:38.532
So we were not only thinking
about development,

00:05:38.532 --> 00:05:40.854
but we were thinking about the program,

00:05:40.854 --> 00:05:44.360
thinking about the kind of connections
that could happen

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.809
between one house and another,
between one neighbor and another.

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.181
This building became what we call
the Listening House,

00:05:53.181 --> 00:05:56.431
and it has a collection of discarded books

00:05:56.431 --> 00:05:59.102
from the Johnson Publishing Corporation,

00:05:59.102 --> 00:06:03.095
and other books from an old bookstore
that was going out of business.

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:07.368
I was actually just wanting to activate
these buildings as much as I could

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:10.688
with whatever and whoever would join me.

00:06:11.678 --> 00:06:14.612
In Chicago, there's
amazing building stock.

00:06:14.612 --> 00:06:18.791
This building, which had been
the former crack house on the block,

00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:21.345
and when the building became abandoned,

00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:25.246
it became a great opportunity to really
imagine what else could happen there.

00:06:25.246 --> 00:06:29.298
So this space we converted into
what we call Black Cinema House.

00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:33.419
Black Cinema House was an opportunity
in the hood to screen films

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.633
that were important and relevant
to the folk who lived around me,

00:06:37.633 --> 00:06:41.348
that if we wanted to show
an old Melvin Van Peebles film, we could.

00:06:41.348 --> 00:06:44.018
If we wanted to show "Car Wash," we could.

00:06:44.018 --> 00:06:45.991
That would be awesome.

00:06:45.991 --> 00:06:48.546
The building we soon outgrew,

00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:51.053
and we had to move to a larger space.

00:06:51.053 --> 00:06:55.488
Black Cinema House, which was made
from just a small piece of clay,

00:06:55.488 --> 00:07:02.779
had to grow into a much larger
piece of clay, which is now my studio.

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:06.588
What I realized was that
for those of you who are zoning junkies,

00:07:06.588 --> 00:07:08.582
that some of the things that I was doing

00:07:08.582 --> 00:07:11.881
in these buildings
that had been left behind,

00:07:11.881 --> 00:07:15.713
they were not the uses by which
the buildings were built,

00:07:15.713 --> 00:07:17.941
and that there are city policies that say,

00:07:17.941 --> 00:07:21.260
"Hey, a house that is residential
needs to stay residential."

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:26.067
But what do you do in neighborhoods when
ain't nobody interested in living there?

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:30.011
That the people who have
the means to leave have already left?

00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:32.498
What do we do with
these abandoned buildings?

00:07:32.498 --> 00:07:35.703
And so I was trying
to wake them up using culture.

00:07:35.703 --> 00:07:38.706
We found that that
was so exciting for folk,

00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:43.271
and people were so responsive to the work,
that we had to then find bigger buildings.

00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:45.316
By the time we found bigger buildings,

00:07:45.316 --> 00:07:49.569
there was, in part, the resources 
necessary to think about those things.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:53.901
In this bank that we called the Arts Bank,
it was in pretty bad shape.

00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:57.187
There was about six feet
of standing water.

00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:59.649
It was a difficult project to finance,

00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:02.079
because banks weren't interested
in the neighborhood

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:04.641
because people weren't interested
in the neighborhood

00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.742
because nothing had happened there.

00:08:06.742 --> 00:08:10.724
It was dirt. It was nothing.
It was nowhere.

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:16.381
And so we just started imagining,
what else could happen in this building?

00:08:16.381 --> 00:08:21.846
(Applause)

00:08:21.846 --> 00:08:24.615
And so now that the rumor
of my block has spread,

00:08:24.615 --> 00:08:26.595
and lots of people are starting to visit,

00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:28.696
we've found that the bank
can now be a center

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:31.908
for exhibition, archives,
music performance,

00:08:31.908 --> 00:08:34.686
and that there are people
who are now interested

00:08:34.686 --> 00:08:38.224
in being adjacent to those buildings
because we brought some heat,

00:08:38.224 --> 00:08:40.677
that we kind of made a fire.

00:08:40.677 --> 00:08:44.926
One of the archives that we'll have there
is this Johnson Publishing Corporation.

00:08:44.926 --> 00:08:48.525
We've also started to collect
memorabilia from American history,

00:08:48.525 --> 00:08:52.356
from people who live
or have lived in that neighborhood.

00:08:52.356 --> 00:08:56.094
Some of these images
are degraded images of black people,

00:08:56.094 --> 00:08:59.368
kind of histories
of very challenging content,

00:08:59.368 --> 00:09:01.829
and where better than a neighborhood

00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:06.099
with young people who are constantly
asking themselves about their identity

00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:08.354
to talk about some of the complexities

00:09:08.354 --> 00:09:10.196
of race and class?

00:09:10.896 --> 00:09:14.623
In some ways, the bank represents a hub,

00:09:14.623 --> 00:09:19.975
that we're trying to create a pretty 
hardcore node of cultural activity,

00:09:19.975 --> 00:09:22.842
and that if we could start
to make multiple hubs

00:09:22.842 --> 00:09:25.791
and connect some cool
green stuff around there,

00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:28.740
that the buildings that we've
purchased and rehabbed,

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.014
which is now around 60 or 70 units,

00:09:32.014 --> 00:09:37.447
that if we could land
miniature Versailles on top of that,

00:09:37.447 --> 00:09:40.930
and connect these buildings
by a beautiful greenbelt --

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.855
(Applause) --

00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:47.315
that this place where people
never wanted to be

00:09:47.315 --> 00:09:49.776
would become an important destination

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:52.357
for folk from all over
the country and world.

00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:56.812
In some ways, it feels
very much like I'm a potter,

00:09:56.812 --> 00:10:00.225
that we tackle the things
that are at our wheel,

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.488
we try with the skill that we have

00:10:02.488 --> 00:10:07.028
to think about this next bowl
that I want to make.

00:10:07.028 --> 00:10:11.927
And it went from a bowl to a singular
house to a block to a neighborhood

00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:14.621
to a cultural district
to thinking about the city,

00:10:14.621 --> 00:10:18.707
and at every point, there were things
that I didn't know that I had to learn.

00:10:18.707 --> 00:10:21.749
I've never learned so much
about zoning law in my life.

00:10:21.749 --> 00:10:23.529
I never thought I'd have to.

00:10:23.529 --> 00:10:26.486
But as a result of that, I'm finding
that there's not just room

00:10:26.486 --> 00:10:28.227
for my own artistic practice,

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:30.763
there's room for a lot of other
artistic practices.

00:10:31.803 --> 00:10:33.382
So people started asking us,

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:35.853
"Well, Theaster, how are you
going to go to scale?"

00:10:35.853 --> 00:10:37.988
and, "What's your sustainability plan?"

00:10:37.988 --> 00:10:42.739
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:42.739 --> 00:10:46.616
And what I found was that
I couldn't export myself,

00:10:46.616 --> 00:10:50.355
that what seems necessary
in cities like Akron, Ohio,

00:10:50.355 --> 00:10:52.955
and Detroit, Michigan, and Gary, Indiana,

00:10:52.955 --> 00:10:56.653
is that there are people in those places
who already believe in those places,

00:10:56.653 --> 00:10:59.579
that are already dying
to make those places beautiful,

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:03.038
and that often, those people
who are passionate about a place

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:07.450
are disconnected from the resources
necessary to make cool things happen,

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.027
or disconnected from
a contingency of people

00:11:10.027 --> 00:11:11.908
that could help make things happen.

00:11:11.908 --> 00:11:16.200
So now, we're starting to give advice
around the country

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.345
on how to start with what you got,

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.140
how to start with the things
that are in front of you,

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.517
how to make something out of nothing,

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:28.045
how to reshape your world
at a wheel or at your block

00:11:28.045 --> 00:11:30.530
or at the scale of the city.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.225
Thank you so much.

00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:38.131
(Applause)

00:11:39.695 --> 00:11:43.201
June Cohen: Thank you. So I think
many people watching this

00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:46.406
will be asking themselves
the question you just raised at the end:

00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:48.588
How can they do this in their own city?

00:11:48.588 --> 00:11:50.209
You can't export yourself.

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:53.882
Give us a few pages out of your playbook
about what someone who is inspired

00:11:53.882 --> 00:11:56.772
about their city can do
to take on projects like yours?

00:11:56.772 --> 00:11:59.965
Theaster Gates: One of the things
I've found that's really important

00:11:59.965 --> 00:12:04.052
is giving thought to not just
the kind of individual project,

00:12:04.052 --> 00:12:06.846
like an old house,

00:12:06.846 --> 00:12:09.717
but what's the relationship
between an old house,

00:12:09.717 --> 00:12:12.875
a local school, a small bodega,

00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:15.871
and is there some kind of synergy
between those things?

00:12:15.871 --> 00:12:18.169
Can you get those folk talking?

00:12:18.169 --> 00:12:22.720
I've found that in cases
where neighborhoods have failed,

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.903
they still often have a pulse.

00:12:24.903 --> 00:12:28.362
How do you identify the pulse
in that place, the passionate people,

00:12:28.362 --> 00:12:31.367
and then how do you get folk
who have been fighting,

00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:35.758
slogging for 20 years, reenergized
about the place that they live?

00:12:35.758 --> 00:12:38.219
And so someone has to do that work.

00:12:38.219 --> 00:12:42.492
If I were a traditional developer,
I would be talking about buildings alone,

00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:46.439
and then putting
a "For Lease" sign in the window.

00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:49.086
I think that you actually
have to curate more than that,

00:12:49.086 --> 00:12:51.784
that there's a way in which
you have to be mindful about,

00:12:51.784 --> 00:12:54.840
what are the businesses
that I want to grow here?

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.282
And then, are there people
who live in this place

00:12:57.282 --> 00:12:59.302
who want to grow those businesses with me?

00:12:59.302 --> 00:13:02.135
Because I think it's not just
a cultural space or housing;

00:13:02.135 --> 00:13:05.177
there has to be the recreation
of an economic core.

00:13:05.177 --> 00:13:08.845
So thinking about those things
together feels right.

00:13:08.845 --> 00:13:11.651
JC: It's hard to get people
to create the spark again

00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:13.698
when people have been
slogging for 20 years.

00:13:13.698 --> 00:13:16.815
Are there any methods you've found
that have helped break through?

00:13:16.815 --> 00:13:19.782
TG: Yeah, I think that now
there are lots of examples

00:13:19.782 --> 00:13:21.616
of folk who are doing amazing work,

00:13:21.616 --> 00:13:26.051
but those methods are sometimes like,
when the media is constantly saying

00:13:26.051 --> 00:13:29.023
that only violent things
happen in a place,

00:13:29.023 --> 00:13:32.320
then based on your skill set
and the particular context,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.640
what are the things that you can do
in your neighborhood

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.765
to kind of fight some of that?

00:13:37.765 --> 00:13:40.668
So I've found that
if you're a theater person,

00:13:40.668 --> 00:13:42.943
you have outdoor street theater festivals.

00:13:42.943 --> 00:13:46.867
In some cases, we don't have
the resources in certain neighborhoods

00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:50.211
to do things that are
a certain kind of splashy,

00:13:50.211 --> 00:13:53.322
but if we can then find ways
of making sure that people

00:13:53.322 --> 00:13:54.854
who are local to a place,

00:13:54.854 --> 00:13:58.686
plus people who could be supportive
of the things that are happening locally,

00:13:58.686 --> 00:14:00.450
when those people get together,

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.586
I think really amazing things can happen.

00:14:02.586 --> 00:14:04.072
JC: So interesting.

00:14:04.072 --> 00:14:06.394
And how can you make sure
that the projects you're creating

00:14:06.394 --> 00:14:08.159
are actually for the disadvantaged

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:12.199
and not just for the sort of
vegetarian indie movie crowd

00:14:12.199 --> 00:14:14.318
that might move in
to take advantage of them.

00:14:14.318 --> 00:14:19.359
TG: Right on. So I think this is where
it starts to get into the thick weeds.

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.996
JC: Let's go there.
TG: Right now, Grand Crossing

00:14:21.996 --> 00:14:24.993
is 99 percent black, or at least living,

00:14:24.993 --> 00:14:28.313
and we know that maybe
who owns property in a place

00:14:28.313 --> 00:14:30.774
is different from who walks
the streets every day.

00:14:30.774 --> 00:14:33.630
So it's reasonable to say
that Grand Crossing is already

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.485
in the process of being something
different than it is today.

00:14:37.485 --> 00:14:43.080
But are there ways to think about
housing trusts or land trusts

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.518
or a mission-based development

00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:48.281
that starts to protect
some of the space that happens,

00:14:48.281 --> 00:14:52.600
because when you have
7,500 empty lots in a city,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.551
you want something to happen there,

00:14:54.551 --> 00:14:59.055
but you need entities that are not
just interested in the development piece,

00:14:59.055 --> 00:15:02.143
but entities that are interested
in the stabilization piece,

00:15:02.143 --> 00:15:05.649
and I feel like often the developer piece
is really motivated,

00:15:05.649 --> 00:15:09.016
but the other work of a kind
of neighborhood consciousness,

00:15:09.016 --> 00:15:10.990
that part doesn't live anymore.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:15.796
So how do you start to grow up
important watchdogs

00:15:15.796 --> 00:15:18.518
that ensure that the resources
that are made available

00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:19.954
to new folk that are coming in

00:15:19.954 --> 00:15:23.346
are also distributed to folk
who have lived in a place for a long time.

00:15:23.346 --> 00:15:25.955
JC: That makes so much sense.
One more question:

00:15:25.955 --> 00:15:30.002
You make such a compelling case for beauty
and the importance of beauty and the arts.

00:15:30.002 --> 00:15:33.280
There would be others who would argue
that funds would be better spent

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.484
on basic services for the disadvantaged.

00:15:36.484 --> 00:15:40.194
How do you combat that viewpoint,
or come against it?

00:15:40.194 --> 00:15:42.694
TG: I believe that beauty 
is a basic service.

00:15:42.694 --> 00:15:48.713
(Applause)

00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:54.168
Often what I have found is that
when there are resources

00:15:54.168 --> 00:15:57.628
that have not been made available
to certain under-resourced cities

00:15:57.628 --> 00:15:59.694
or neighborhoods or communities,

00:15:59.694 --> 00:16:04.397
that sometimes culture is the thing
that helps to ignite,

00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:07.037
and that I can't do everything,

00:16:07.037 --> 00:16:10.444
but I think that there's a way in which
if you can start with culture

00:16:10.444 --> 00:16:13.416
and get people kind of
reinvested in their place,

00:16:13.416 --> 00:16:17.689
other kinds of adjacent
amenities start to grow,

00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:21.642
and then people can make a demand
that's a poetic demand,

00:16:21.642 --> 00:16:26.883
and the political demands that
are necessary to wake up our cities,

00:16:26.883 --> 00:16:28.646
they also become very poetic.

00:16:28.646 --> 00:16:30.558
JC: It makes perfect sense to me.

00:16:30.558 --> 00:16:33.225
Theaster, thank you so much
for being here with us today.

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:34.476
Thank you. Theaster Gates.

00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:39.491
(Applause)
