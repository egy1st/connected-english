00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:03.073
Tonight, I'm going to try to make the case

00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:07.699
that inviting a loved one, a friend
or even a stranger

00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:10.130
to record a meaningful interview with you

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.536
just might turn out to be one of the most 
important moments in that person's life,

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:17.481
and in yours.

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:20.825
When I was 22 years old,
I was lucky enough to find my calling

00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:23.285
when I fell into making radio stories.

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:25.719
At almost the exact same time,

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:30.688
I found out that my dad,
who I was very, very close to, was gay.

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:32.990
I was taken completely by surprise.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.498
We were a very tight-knit family,

00:00:35.498 --> 00:00:37.889
and I was crushed.

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:40.234
At some point, in one
of our strained conversations,

00:00:40.234 --> 00:00:42.904
my dad mentioned the Stonewall riots.

00:00:42.904 --> 00:00:46.178
He told me that one night in 1969,

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.883
a group of young black
and Latino drag queens

00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:52.529
fought back against the police
at a gay bar in Manhattan

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:54.549
called the Stonewall Inn,

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.078
and how this sparked
the modern gay rights movement.

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:01.417
It was an amazing story,
and it piqued my interest.

00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:05.628
So I decided to pick up my tape 
recorder and find out more.

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:09.804
With the help of a young archivist
named Michael Shirker,

00:01:09.804 --> 00:01:12.381
we tracked down all
of the people we could find

00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:15.817
who had been at
the Stonewall Inn that night.

00:01:15.817 --> 00:01:17.814
Recording these interviews,

00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:20.043
I saw how the microphone
gave me the license

00:01:20.043 --> 00:01:22.779
to go places I otherwise
never would have gone

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:26.912
and talk to people I might not
otherwise ever have spoken to.

00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:28.754
I had the privilege of getting to know

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:32.648
some of the most amazing,
fierce and courageous human beings

00:01:32.648 --> 00:01:34.830
I had ever met.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.934
It was the first time
the story of Stonewall

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:38.986
had been told to a national audience.

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:41.239
I dedicated the program to my dad,

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:46.715
it changed my relationship with him,
and it changed my life.

00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:51.617
Over the next 15 years,
I made many more radio documentaries,

00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:55.681
working to shine a light on people
who are rarely heard from in the media.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:57.260
Over and over again,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.860
I'd see how this simple act
of being interviewed

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.020
could mean so much to people,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.711
particularly those who had been told
that their stories didn't matter.

00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:08.080
I could literally see
people's back straighten

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.866
as they started to speak
into the microphone.

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:15.371
In 1998, I made a documentary
about the last flophouse hotels

00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:17.762
on the Bowery in Manhattan.

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:20.432
Guys stayed up in these
cheap hotels for decades.

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.824
They lived in cubicles
the size of prison cells

00:02:22.824 --> 00:02:24.124
covered with chicken wire

00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:27.088
so you couldn't jump
from one room into the next.

00:02:27.088 --> 00:02:31.067
Later, I wrote a book on the men
with the photographer Harvey Wang.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:35.491
I remember walking into a flophouse
with an early version of the book

00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:38.079
and showing one of the guys his page.

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.354
He stood there staring at it in silence,

00:02:40.354 --> 00:02:42.653
then he grabbed the book out of my hand

00:02:42.653 --> 00:02:46.136
and started running down
the long, narrow hallway

00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:47.645
holding it over his head

00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:52.010
shouting, "I exist! I exist."

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.863
(Applause)

00:02:56.863 --> 00:03:00.694
In many ways, "I exist" became
the clarion call for StoryCorps,

00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:04.270
this crazy idea that I had
a dozen years ago.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.499
The thought was to take
documentary work

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.356
and turn it on its head.

00:03:08.356 --> 00:03:10.610
Traditionally, broadcast documentary

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.696
has been about recording interviews
to create a work of art or entertainment

00:03:14.696 --> 00:03:18.944
or education that is seen or heard
by a whole lot of people,

00:03:18.944 --> 00:03:20.325
but I wanted to try something

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.473
where the interview itself
was the purpose of this work,

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:26.445
and see if we could give many,
many, many people the chance

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:29.069
to be listened to in this way.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.119
So in Grand Central Terminal 11 years ago,

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:36.492
we built a booth where anyone 
can come to honor someone else

00:03:36.492 --> 00:03:39.503
by interviewing them about their life.

00:03:39.503 --> 00:03:43.334
You come to this booth and you're met
by a facilitator who brings you inside.

00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:45.911
You sit across from, say, your grandfather

00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:48.953
for close to an hour
and you listen and you talk.

00:03:48.953 --> 00:03:52.645
Many people think of it as,
if this was to be our last conversation,

00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:55.640
what would I want to ask of
and say to this person

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.916
who means so much to me?

00:03:57.916 --> 00:04:01.203
At the end of the session,
you walk away with a copy of the interview

00:04:01.203 --> 00:04:03.861
and another copy goes
to the American Folklife Center

00:04:03.861 --> 00:04:06.119
at the Library of Congress

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:10.175
so that your great-great-great-grandkids
can someday get to know your grandfather

00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:12.368
through his voice and story.

00:04:13.548 --> 00:04:16.705
So we open this booth
in one of the busiest places in the world

00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:20.188
and invite people to have this
incredibly intimate conversation

00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:21.419
with another human being.

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.225
I had no idea if it would work,
but from the very beginning, it did.

00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:29.104
People treated the experience
with incredible respect,

00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:32.471
and amazing conversations happened inside.

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:35.002
I want to play just one animated excerpt

00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:38.763
from an interview recorded
at that original Grand Central Booth.

00:04:38.763 --> 00:04:43.291
This is 12-year-old Joshua Littman
interviewing his mother, Sarah.

00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:45.497
Josh has Asperger's syndrome.

00:04:45.497 --> 00:04:48.562
As you may know, kids with Asperger's
are incredibly smart

00:04:48.562 --> 00:04:50.721
but have a tough time socially.

00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:52.370
They usually have obsessions.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.576
In Josh's case, it's with animals,

00:04:54.576 --> 00:04:57.199
so this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.499
at Grand Central nine years ago.

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:02.776
(Video) Josh Littman:
From a scale of one to 10,

00:05:02.776 --> 00:05:05.758
do you think your life would be
different without animals?

00:05:05.758 --> 00:05:08.565
Sarah Littman: I think it would be
an eight without animals,

00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:10.699
because they add so much pleasure to life.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.898
JL: How else do you think your life
would be different without them?

00:05:13.898 --> 00:05:16.617
SL: I could do without things
like cockroaches and snakes.

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:19.518
JL: Well, I'm okay with snakes
as long as they're not venomous

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:20.919
or constrict you or anything.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.778
SL: Yeah, I'm not a big snake person --

00:05:22.778 --> 00:05:25.288
JL: But cockroach is just
the insect we love to hate.

00:05:25.288 --> 00:05:26.821
SL: Yeah, it really is.

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:29.955
JL: Have you ever thought
you couldn't cope with having a child?

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:33.345
SL: I remember when you were a baby,
you had really bad colic,

00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:34.948
so you would just cry and cry.

00:05:34.948 --> 00:05:38.105
JL: What's colic?
SL: It's when you get this stomach ache

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:40.590
and all you do is scream
for, like, four hours.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.563
JL: Even louder than Amy does?

00:05:42.563 --> 00:05:45.907
SL: You were pretty loud,
but Amy's was more high-pitched.

00:05:45.907 --> 00:05:49.111
JL: I think it feels like everyone
seems to like Amy more,

00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:51.781
like she's the perfect little angel.

00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:55.644
SL: Well, I can understand
why you think that people like Amy more,

00:05:55.644 --> 00:05:58.483
and I'm not saying it's because
of your Asperger's syndrome,

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:01.487
but being friendly comes easily to Amy,

00:06:01.487 --> 00:06:03.902
whereas I think for you
it's more difficult,

00:06:03.902 --> 00:06:07.942
but the people who take the time
to get to know you love you so much.

00:06:07.942 --> 00:06:10.357
JL: Like Ben or Eric or Carlos?
SL: Yeah --

00:06:10.357 --> 00:06:14.838
JL: Like I have better quality friends
but less quantity? (Laughter)

00:06:14.838 --> 00:06:17.119
SL: I wouldn't judge
the quality, but I think --

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:20.887
JL: I mean, first it was like, Amy
loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia,

00:06:20.887 --> 00:06:22.914
she loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia.

00:06:22.914 --> 00:06:24.802
SL: Part of that's a girl thing, honey.

00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:28.134
The important thing for you
is that you have a few very good friends,

00:06:28.134 --> 00:06:30.160
and really that's what you need in life.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.409
JL: Did I turn out to be the son
you wanted when I was born?

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.311
Did I meet your expectations?

00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:40.074
SL: You've exceeded
my expectations, sweetie,

00:06:40.074 --> 00:06:44.834
because, sure, you have these fantasies
of what your child's going to be like,

00:06:44.834 --> 00:06:48.727
but you have made me grow
so much as a parent, because you think --

00:06:48.727 --> 00:06:50.888
JL: Well, I was the one
who made you a parent.

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:54.375
SL: You were the one who made me a parent.
That's a good point. (Laughter)

00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:56.199
But also because you think differently

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.102
from what they tell you
in the parenting books,

00:06:59.102 --> 00:07:02.562
I really had to learn to think
outside of the box with you,

00:07:02.562 --> 00:07:07.368
and it's made me much more creative
as a parent and as a person,

00:07:07.368 --> 00:07:09.036
and I'll always thank you for that.

00:07:09.036 --> 00:07:10.966
JL: And that helped when Amy was born?

00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:15.800
SL: And that helped when Amy was born,
but you are so incredibly special to me

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.163
and I'm so lucky to have you as my son.

00:07:19.163 --> 00:07:25.810
(Applause)

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.287
David Isay: After this story
ran on public radio,

00:07:29.287 --> 00:07:31.051
Josh received hundreds of letters

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:33.373
telling him what an amazing kid he was.

00:07:33.373 --> 00:07:35.602
His mom, Sarah, bound them
together in a book,

00:07:35.602 --> 00:07:39.648
and when Josh got picked on at school,
they would read the letters together.

00:07:39.648 --> 00:07:41.915
I just want to acknowledge
that two of my heroes

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:43.218
are here with us tonight.

00:07:43.218 --> 00:07:48.019
Sarah Littman and her son Josh,
who is now an honors student in college.

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:51.809
(Applause)

00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:55.691
You know, a lot of people talk about
crying when they hear StoryCorps stories,

00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:57.638
and it's not because they're sad.

00:07:57.638 --> 00:07:58.962
Most of them aren't.

00:07:58.962 --> 00:08:02.015
I think it's because you're hearing
something authentic and pure

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:04.406
at this moment,
when sometimes it's hard to tell

00:08:04.406 --> 00:08:07.402
what's real and what's an advertisement.

00:08:07.402 --> 00:08:09.793
It's kind of the anti-reality TV.

00:08:09.793 --> 00:08:11.906
Nobody comes to StoryCorps to get rich.

00:08:11.906 --> 00:08:13.787
Nobody comes to get famous.

00:08:13.787 --> 00:08:16.991
It's simply an act of generosity and love.

00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:19.243
So many of these are just everyday people

00:08:19.243 --> 00:08:24.375
talking about lives lived with kindness,
courage, decency and dignity,

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:26.372
and when you hear that kind of story,

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:30.755
it can sometimes feel
like you're walking on holy ground.

00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:33.260
So this experiment 
in Grand Central worked,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.650
and we expanded across the country.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.863
Today, more than 100,000 people
in all 50 states

00:08:38.863 --> 00:08:41.719
in thousands of cities
and towns across America

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:44.064
have recorded StoryCorps interviews.

00:08:44.064 --> 00:08:48.987
It's now the largest single collection
of human voices ever gathered.

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:54.815
(Applause)

00:08:54.815 --> 00:08:57.253
We've hired and trained
hundreds of facilitators

00:08:57.253 --> 00:08:59.969
to help guide people
through the experience.

00:08:59.969 --> 00:09:02.384
Most serve a year or two with StoryCorps

00:09:02.384 --> 00:09:05.821
traveling the country,
gathering the wisdom of humanity.

00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:07.980
They call it bearing witness,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.385
and if you ask them,

00:09:09.385 --> 00:09:12.659
all of the facilitators will tell you
that the most important thing

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:15.527
they've learned from being present
during these interviews

00:09:15.527 --> 00:09:18.963
is that people are basically good.

00:09:18.963 --> 00:09:21.921
And I think for the first years
of StoryCorps, you could argue

00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:24.557
that there was some kind
of a selection bias happening,

00:09:24.557 --> 00:09:27.833
but after tens of thousands of interviews
with every kind of person

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:29.482
in every part of the country --

00:09:29.482 --> 00:09:32.918
rich, poor, five years old to 105,

00:09:32.918 --> 00:09:35.983
80 different languages,
across the political spectrum --

00:09:37.063 --> 00:09:41.277
you have to think that maybe these guys
are actually onto something.

00:09:41.277 --> 00:09:44.568
I've also learned so much
from these interviews.

00:09:44.568 --> 00:09:47.772
I've learned about the poetry
and the wisdom and the grace

00:09:47.772 --> 00:09:50.512
that can be found in the words
of people all around us

00:09:50.512 --> 00:09:53.809
when we simply take the time to listen,

00:09:53.809 --> 00:09:57.042
like this interview

00:09:57.042 --> 00:10:00.380
between a betting clerk in Brooklyn
named Danny Perasa

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.442
who brought his wife Annie to StoryCorps
to talk about his love for her.

00:10:06.632 --> 00:10:08.974
(Audio) Danny Perasa: You see,
the thing of it is,

00:10:08.974 --> 00:10:11.450
I always feel guilty when I say
"I love you" to you.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.358
And I say it so often.
I say it to remind you

00:10:14.358 --> 00:10:17.214
that as dumpy as I am,
it's coming from me.

00:10:17.214 --> 00:10:20.668
It's like hearing a beautiful song
from a busted old radio,

00:10:20.668 --> 00:10:23.295
and it's nice of you to keep
the radio around the house.

00:10:23.295 --> 00:10:26.101
Annie Perasa: If I don't have a note
on the kitchen table,

00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:27.688
I think there's something wrong.

00:10:27.688 --> 00:10:29.742
You write a love letter
to me every morning.

00:10:29.742 --> 00:10:32.271
DP: Well, the only thing
that could possibly be wrong

00:10:32.271 --> 00:10:33.804
is I couldn't find a silly pen.

00:10:33.804 --> 00:10:34.831
AP: To my princess:

00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:37.048
The weather outside today
is extremely rainy.

00:10:37.048 --> 00:10:39.001
I'll call you at 11:20 in the morning.

00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:40.817
DP: It's a romantic weather report.

00:10:40.817 --> 00:10:43.567
AP: And I love you.
I love you. I love you.

00:10:43.567 --> 00:10:46.666
DP: When a guy is happily married,
no matter what happens at work,

00:10:46.666 --> 00:10:48.823
no matter what happens
in the rest of the day,

00:10:48.823 --> 00:10:50.544
there's a shelter when you get home,

00:10:50.544 --> 00:10:53.097
there's a knowledge knowing
that you can hug somebody

00:10:53.097 --> 00:10:56.644
without them throwing you downstairs
and saying, "Get your hands off me."

00:10:56.644 --> 00:10:59.271
Being married is like having
a color television set.

00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:01.478
You never want to go back
to black and white.

00:11:01.478 --> 00:11:04.820
(Laughter)

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.956
DI: Danny was about five feet tall

00:11:06.956 --> 00:11:10.369
with crossed eyes
and one single snaggletooth,

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:14.061
but Danny Perasa had
more romance in his little pinky

00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:17.174
than all of Hollywood's
leading men put together.

00:11:17.174 --> 00:11:19.077
What else have I learned?

00:11:19.077 --> 00:11:21.979
I've learned about the almost
unimaginable capacity

00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:24.162
for the human spirit to forgive.

00:11:24.162 --> 00:11:27.807
I've learned about resilience
and I've learned about strength.

00:11:27.807 --> 00:11:31.150
Like an interview with Oshea Israel
and Mary Johnson.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.701
When Oshea was a teenager,
he murdered Mary's only son,

00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:38.186
Laramiun Byrd, in a gang fight.

00:11:38.186 --> 00:11:40.786
A dozen years later, Mary went to prison

00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:43.526
to meet Oshea and find out
who this person was

00:11:43.526 --> 00:11:46.475
who had taken her son's life.

00:11:46.475 --> 00:11:49.261
Slowly and remarkably,
they became friends,

00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:51.955
and when he was finally released
from the penitentiary,

00:11:51.955 --> 00:11:55.321
Oshea actually moved in next door to Mary.

00:11:55.321 --> 00:11:58.526
This is just a short excerpt
of a conversation they had

00:11:58.526 --> 00:12:01.069
soon after Oshea was freed.

00:12:02.079 --> 00:12:05.051
(Video) Mary Johnson: My natural son
is no longer here.

00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:08.835
I didn't see him graduate,
and now you're going to college.

00:12:08.835 --> 00:12:12.132
I'll have the opportunity
to see you graduate.

00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:14.593
I didn't see him get married.

00:12:14.593 --> 00:12:18.502
Hopefully one day, I'll be able
to experience that with you.

00:12:18.502 --> 00:12:21.199
Oshea Israel: Just to hear you
say those things and to be

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:24.859
in my life in the manner
in which you are is my motivation.

00:12:24.859 --> 00:12:29.616
It motivates me to make sure
that I stay on the right path.

00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:31.543
You still believe in me,

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:35.119
and the fact that you can do it
despite how much pain I caused you,

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:37.209
it's amazing.

00:12:37.209 --> 00:12:43.106
MJ: I know it's not an easy thing
to be able to share our story together,

00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:45.869
even with us sitting here
looking at each other right now.

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:51.616
I know it's not an easy thing,
so I admire that you can do this.

00:12:51.616 --> 00:12:56.666
OI: I love you, lady.
MJ: I love you too, son.

00:13:00.156 --> 00:13:06.372
(Applause)

00:13:06.372 --> 00:13:11.526
DI: And I've been reminded countless times
of the courage and goodness of people,

00:13:11.526 --> 00:13:16.588
and how the arc of history
truly does bend towards justice.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:21.069
Like the story of Alexis Martinez,
who was born Arthur Martinez

00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:23.693
in the Harold Ickes projects in Chicago.

00:13:23.693 --> 00:13:26.526
In the interview, she talks
with her daughter Lesley

00:13:26.526 --> 00:13:28.894
about joining a gang as a young man,

00:13:28.894 --> 00:13:33.724
and later in life transitioning
into the woman she was always meant to be.

00:13:33.724 --> 00:13:36.223
This is Alexis and her daughter Lesley.

00:13:36.223 --> 00:13:39.482
(Audio) Alexis Martinez: One of the most
difficult things for me was

00:13:39.482 --> 00:13:42.408
I was always afraid that
I wouldn't be allowed

00:13:42.408 --> 00:13:45.287
to be in my granddaughters' lives,

00:13:45.287 --> 00:13:47.585
and you blew that completely
out of the water,

00:13:47.585 --> 00:13:48.909
you and your husband.

00:13:48.909 --> 00:13:52.369
One of the fruits of that is,
in my relationship with my granddaughters,

00:13:52.369 --> 00:13:55.946
they fight with each other sometimes
over whether I'm he or she.

00:13:55.946 --> 00:13:58.433
Lesley Martinez: But they're free
to talk about it.

00:13:58.433 --> 00:14:01.489
AM: They're free to talk about it,
but that, to me, is a miracle.

00:14:01.489 --> 00:14:04.791
LM: You don't have to apologize.
You don't have to tiptoe.

00:14:04.791 --> 00:14:09.372
We're not going to cut you off,
and that's something I've always

00:14:09.372 --> 00:14:12.337
wanted you to just know,
that you're loved.

00:14:12.337 --> 00:14:14.682
AM: You know, I live this every day now.

00:14:14.682 --> 00:14:19.806
I walk down the streets as a woman,
and I really am at peace with who I am.

00:14:19.806 --> 00:14:22.460
I mean, I wish I had a softer voice maybe,

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:28.332
but now I walk in love
and I try to live that way every day.

00:14:31.562 --> 00:14:34.906
DI: Now I walk in love.

00:14:34.906 --> 00:14:37.808
I'm going to tell you
a secret about StoryCorps.

00:14:37.808 --> 00:14:41.193
It takes some courage
to have these conversations.

00:14:41.193 --> 00:14:43.584
StoryCorps speaks to our mortality.

00:14:43.584 --> 00:14:47.601
Participants know this recording
will be heard long after they're gone.

00:14:47.601 --> 00:14:50.285
There's a hospice doctor named Ira Byock

00:14:50.285 --> 00:14:52.829
who has worked closely with us
on recording interviews

00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:54.286
with people who are dying.

00:14:54.286 --> 00:14:57.051
He wrote a book called
"The Four Things That Matter Most"

00:14:57.051 --> 00:15:00.882
about the four things you want to say
to the most important people in your life

00:15:00.882 --> 00:15:03.924
before they or you die:

00:15:03.924 --> 00:15:06.455
thank you, I love you,

00:15:06.455 --> 00:15:09.682
forgive me, I forgive you.

00:15:09.682 --> 00:15:13.212
They're just about the most powerful words
we can say to one another,

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:16.718
and often that's what happens
in a StoryCorps booth.

00:15:16.718 --> 00:15:20.095
It's a chance to have a sense of closure
with someone you care about --

00:15:20.095 --> 00:15:22.917
no regrets, nothing left unsaid.

00:15:22.917 --> 00:15:26.354
And it's hard and it takes courage,

00:15:26.354 --> 00:15:29.579
but that's why we're alive, right?

00:15:31.299 --> 00:15:33.802
So, the TED Prize.

00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:36.779
When I first heard from TED
and Chris a few months ago

00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:40.615
about the possibility of the Prize,
I was completely floored.

00:15:40.615 --> 00:15:44.186
They asked me to come up
with a very brief wish for humanity,

00:15:44.186 --> 00:15:45.950
no more than 50 words.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.694
So I thought about it,
I wrote my 50 words,

00:15:48.694 --> 00:15:53.381
and a few weeks later,
Chris called and said, "Go for it."

00:15:53.381 --> 00:15:56.329
So here is my wish:

00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:59.278
that you will help us

00:15:59.278 --> 00:16:02.018
take everything we've learned
through StoryCorps

00:16:02.018 --> 00:16:04.781
and bring it to the world

00:16:04.781 --> 00:16:08.798
so that anyone anywhere
can easily record a meaningful interview

00:16:08.798 --> 00:16:13.715
with another human being
which will then be archived for history.

00:16:13.715 --> 00:16:18.393
How are we going to do that? With this.

00:16:18.393 --> 00:16:22.071
We're fast moving into a future
where everyone in the world

00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:24.114
will have access to one of these,

00:16:24.114 --> 00:16:27.945
and it has powers I never
could have imagined 11 years ago

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:29.895
when I started StoryCorps.

00:16:29.895 --> 00:16:31.358
It has a microphone,

00:16:31.358 --> 00:16:33.669
it can tell you how to do things,

00:16:33.669 --> 00:16:36.200
and it can send audio files.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.522
Those are the key ingredients.

00:16:38.522 --> 00:16:41.726
So the first part of the wish
is already underway.

00:16:41.726 --> 00:16:43.305
Over the past couple of months,

00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:46.300
the team at StoryCorps
has been working furiously

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.760
to create an app that will bring
StoryCorps out of our booths

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.193
so that it can be experienced
by anyone, anywhere, anytime.

00:16:55.193 --> 00:16:58.874
Remember, StoryCorps has always
been two people and a facilitator

00:16:58.874 --> 00:17:02.839
helping them record their conversation,
which is preserved forever,

00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:04.887
but at this very moment,

00:17:04.887 --> 00:17:08.533
we're releasing a public beta version
of the StoryCorps app.

00:17:08.533 --> 00:17:11.720
The app is a digital facilitator
that walks you through

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.105
the StoryCorps interview process,

00:17:14.105 --> 00:17:15.777
helps you pick questions,

00:17:15.777 --> 00:17:17.867
and gives you all the tips you need

00:17:17.867 --> 00:17:20.676
to record a meaningful
StoryCorps interview,

00:17:20.676 --> 00:17:26.197
and then with one tap upload it 
to our archive at the Library of Congress.

00:17:26.197 --> 00:17:29.337
That's the easy part, the technology.

00:17:29.337 --> 00:17:31.715
The real challenge is up to you:

00:17:31.715 --> 00:17:34.913
to take this tool and figure out
how we can use it

00:17:34.913 --> 00:17:37.878
all across America and around the world,

00:17:37.878 --> 00:17:41.462
so that instead of recording
thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year,

00:17:41.462 --> 00:17:44.232
we could potentially record
tens of thousands

00:17:44.232 --> 00:17:46.188
or hundreds of thousands

00:17:46.188 --> 00:17:48.185
or maybe even more.

00:17:49.355 --> 00:17:53.093
Imagine, for example,
a national homework assignment

00:17:53.093 --> 00:17:57.087
where every high school student
studying U.S. history across the country

00:17:57.087 --> 00:17:59.989
records an interview
with an elder over Thanksgiving,

00:17:59.989 --> 00:18:02.892
so that in one single weekend

00:18:02.892 --> 00:18:07.977
an entire generation of American lives
and experiences are captured.

00:18:07.977 --> 00:18:13.512
(Applause)

00:18:15.812 --> 00:18:19.354
Or imagine mothers on opposite
sides of a conflict somewhere in the world

00:18:19.354 --> 00:18:22.976
sitting down not to talk
about that conflict

00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:25.173
but to find out who they are as people,

00:18:25.173 --> 00:18:29.128
and in doing so,
begin to build bonds of trust;

00:18:29.128 --> 00:18:32.014
or that someday it becomes
a tradition all over the world

00:18:32.014 --> 00:18:34.522
that people are honored
with a StoryCorps interview

00:18:34.522 --> 00:18:36.765
on their 75th birthday;

00:18:36.765 --> 00:18:39.041
or that people in your community

00:18:39.041 --> 00:18:44.195
go into retirement homes or hospitals
or homeless shelters or even prisons

00:18:44.195 --> 00:18:47.725
armed with this app to honor the people
least heard in our society

00:18:47.725 --> 00:18:50.711
and ask them who they are,
what they've learned in life,

00:18:50.711 --> 00:18:53.172
and how they want to be remembered.

00:18:53.172 --> 00:18:58.707
(Applause)

00:19:00.947 --> 00:19:04.224
Ten years ago, I recorded
a StoryCorps interview with my dad

00:19:04.224 --> 00:19:09.019
who was a psychiatrist,
and became a well-known gay activist.

00:19:09.019 --> 00:19:12.456
This is the picture
of us at that interview.

00:19:12.456 --> 00:19:15.637
I never thought about that recording
until a couple of years ago,

00:19:15.637 --> 00:19:18.632
when my dad, who seemed
to be in perfect health

00:19:18.632 --> 00:19:21.233
and was still seeing patients
40 hours a week,

00:19:21.233 --> 00:19:23.996
was diagnosed with cancer.

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:27.386
He passed away very suddenly
a few days later.

00:19:27.386 --> 00:19:29.661
It was June 28, 2012,

00:19:29.661 --> 00:19:34.041
the anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

00:19:34.041 --> 00:19:37.398
I listened to that interview
for the first time at three in the morning

00:19:37.398 --> 00:19:39.126
on the day that he died.

00:19:39.126 --> 00:19:41.123
I have a couple of young kids at home,

00:19:41.123 --> 00:19:44.582
and I knew that the only way
they were going to get to know this person

00:19:44.582 --> 00:19:49.428
who was such a towering figure in my life
would be through that session.

00:19:49.428 --> 00:19:53.173
I thought I couldn't believe in StoryCorps
any more deeply than I did,

00:19:53.173 --> 00:19:54.961
but it was at that moment

00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:59.820
that I fully and viscerally grasped
the importance of making these recordings.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.913
Every day, people come up to me

00:20:01.913 --> 00:20:06.074
and say, "I wish I had interviewed
my father or my grandmother or my brother,

00:20:06.074 --> 00:20:08.342
but I waited too long."

00:20:08.342 --> 00:20:10.478
Now, no one has to wait anymore.

00:20:10.478 --> 00:20:12.158
At this moment,

00:20:12.158 --> 00:20:15.700
when so much of how we communicate
is fleeting and inconsequential,

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.197
join us in creating this digital archive

00:20:18.197 --> 00:20:22.514
of conversations that are
enduring and important.

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:25.344
Help us create this gift to our children,

00:20:25.344 --> 00:20:29.342
this testament to who
we are as human beings.

00:20:29.342 --> 00:20:33.268
I hope you'll help us make
this wish come true.

00:20:33.268 --> 00:20:37.779
Interview a family member, a friend
or even a stranger.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:44.069
Together, we can create an archive
of the wisdom of humanity,

00:20:44.069 --> 00:20:45.703
and maybe in doing so,

00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:49.665
we'll learn to listen a little more
and shout a little less.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:54.193
Maybe these conversations will remind us
what's really important.

00:20:54.193 --> 00:20:56.956
And maybe, just maybe,

00:20:56.956 --> 00:20:59.742
it will help us recognize
that simple truth

00:20:59.742 --> 00:21:03.689
that every life, every single life,

00:21:03.689 --> 00:21:06.624
matters equally and infinitely.

00:21:06.624 --> 00:21:08.755
Thank you very much.

00:21:08.755 --> 00:21:10.905
(Applause)

00:21:10.905 --> 00:21:15.113
Thank you. Thank you.

00:21:15.113 --> 00:21:17.389
(Applause)

00:21:17.389 --> 00:21:19.571
Thank you.

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:24.935
(Applause)
