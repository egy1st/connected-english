00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:02.889
When I wrote my memoir,

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.566
the publishers were really confused.

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:10.800
Was it about me as a child refugee,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.304
or as a woman who set up a high-tech
software company back in the 1960s,

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:18.380
one that went public

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.963
and eventually employed over 8,500 people?

00:00:22.963 --> 00:00:27.470
Or was it as a mother
of an autistic child?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.925
Or as a philanthropist that's
now given away serious money?

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:34.569
Well, it turns out, I'm all of these.

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:37.469
So let me tell you my story.

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:46.446
All that I am stems from when
I got onto a train in Vienna,

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:51.483
part of the Kindertransport that saved
nearly 10,000 Jewish children

00:00:51.483 --> 00:00:53.851
from Nazi Europe.

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:57.860
I was five years old, clutching the hand
of my nine-year-old sister

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.813
and had very little idea as to 
what was going on.

00:01:01.813 --> 00:01:06.504
"What is England and 
why am I going there?"

00:01:06.504 --> 00:01:13.241
I'm only alive because so long ago, 
I was helped by generous strangers.

00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:18.446
I was lucky, and doubly lucky
to be later reunited

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:20.885
with my birth parents.

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:27.917
But, sadly, I never bonded 
with them again.

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:31.227
But I've done more in the seven decades
since that miserable day 


00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:33.003
when my mother put me on the train

00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:36.290
than I would ever have dreamed possible.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.398
And I love England, my adopted country,

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:44.469
with a passion that perhaps only someone
who has lost their human rights can feel.

00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:52.188
I decided to make mine a life
that was worth saving.

00:01:52.188 --> 00:01:54.449
And then, I just got on with it.

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.524
(Laughter)

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:03.465
Let me take you back to the early 1960s.

00:02:03.465 --> 00:02:07.953
To get past the gender issues of the time,

00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:14.443
I set up my own software house at one
of the first such startups in Britain.

00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:20.301
But it was also a company of women,
a company for women,

00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:23.325
an early social business.

00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:27.001
And people laughed at the very idea
because software, at that time,

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:29.074
was given away free with hardware.

00:02:29.074 --> 00:02:33.808
Nobody would buy software,
certainly not from a woman.

00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:39.745
Although women were then coming out
of the universities with decent degrees,

00:02:39.745 --> 00:02:43.299
there was a glass ceiling to our progress.

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:48.985
And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often,

00:02:48.985 --> 00:02:52.550
and I wanted opportunities for women.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.042
I recruited professionally qualified women
who'd left the industry on marriage,

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:59.293
or when their first child was expected

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:04.484
and structured them into a
home-working organization.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:09.069
We pioneered the concept of women
going back into the workforce

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.611
after a career break.

00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:15.394
We pioneered all sorts of
new, flexible work methods:

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:20.646
job shares, profit-sharing, 
and eventually, co-ownership

00:03:20.646 --> 00:03:24.092
when I took a quarter of the company
into the hands of the staff

00:03:24.092 --> 00:03:27.912
at no cost to anyone but me.

00:03:29.582 --> 00:03:35.773
For years, I was the first woman this,
or the only woman that.

00:03:35.773 --> 00:03:39.539
And in those days, I couldn't work
on the stock exchange,

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:43.300
I couldn't drive a bus or fly an airplane.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.193
Indeed, I couldn't open a bank account
without my husband's permission.

00:03:49.193 --> 00:03:53.715
My generation of women fought
the battles for the right to work

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:58.207
and the right for equal pay.

00:03:58.207 --> 00:04:02.068
Nobody really expected much 
from people at work or in society

00:04:02.068 --> 00:04:04.566
because all the expectations then 


00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:08.461
were about home and 
family responsibilities.

00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:11.298
And I couldn't really face that,

00:04:11.298 --> 00:04:17.287
so I started to challenge
the conventions of the time,

00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:23.142
even to the extent of changing my name
from "Stephanie" to "Steve"

00:04:23.142 --> 00:04:24.891
in my business development letters,

00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:27.369
so as to get through the door
before anyone realized

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:28.750
that he was a she.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.054
(Laughter)

00:04:32.054 --> 00:04:39.214
My company, called Freelance Programmers,
and that's precisely what it was,

00:04:39.214 --> 00:04:44.287
couldn't have started smaller: 
on the dining room table,

00:04:44.287 --> 00:04:49.681
and financed by the equivalent
of 100 dollars in today's terms,

00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:56.978
and financed by my labor and 
by borrowing against the house.

00:04:56.978 --> 00:05:02.615
My interests were scientific, 
the market was commercial --

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:06.640
things such as payroll,
which I found rather boring.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.752
So I had to compromise with 
operational research work,

00:05:11.752 --> 00:05:15.183
which had the intellectual challenge 
that interested me

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:22.850
and the commercial value 
that was valued by the clients:

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.108
things like scheduling freight trains,

00:05:28.108 --> 00:05:34.297
time-tabling buses, stock control,
lots and lots of stock control.

00:05:34.297 --> 00:05:38.545
And eventually, the work came in.

00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:42.300
We disguised the domestic and
part-time nature of the staff

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.440
by offering fixed prices,
one of the very first to do so.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.755
And who would have guessed
that the programming

00:05:50.755 --> 00:05:54.699
of the black box flight recorder 
of Supersonic Concord

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.908
would have been done by a bunch 
of women working in their own homes.

00:05:59.908 --> 00:06:06.682
(Applause)

00:06:07.392 --> 00:06:12.323
All we used was a simple 
"trust the staff" approach

00:06:12.323 --> 00:06:14.504
and a simple telephone.

00:06:14.504 --> 00:06:20.225
We even used to ask job applicants, 
"Do you have access to a telephone?"

00:06:22.175 --> 00:06:25.194
An early project was to develop
software standards

00:06:25.194 --> 00:06:27.434
on management control protocols.

00:06:27.434 --> 00:06:33.636
And software was and still is a
maddeningly hard-to-control activity,

00:06:33.636 --> 00:06:35.747
so that was enormously valuable.

00:06:35.747 --> 00:06:37.971
We used the standards ourselves,

00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:40.989
we were even paid to update 
them over the years,

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:45.253
and eventually, they were adopted by NATO.

00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:50.450
Our programmers -- remember, only women,

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.896
including gay and transgender --

00:06:53.896 --> 00:06:58.939
worked with pencil and paper
to develop flowcharts

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:02.596
defining each task to be done.

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:06.509
And they then wrote code, 
usually machine code,

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.776
sometimes binary code,

00:07:08.776 --> 00:07:13.506
which was then sent
by mail to a data center

00:07:13.506 --> 00:07:17.724
to be punched onto
paper tape or card

00:07:17.724 --> 00:07:22.051
and then re-punched, 
in order to verify it.

00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:25.387
All this, before it ever got
near a computer.

00:07:25.387 --> 00:07:30.046
That was programming in the early 1960s.

00:07:31.566 --> 00:07:36.701
In 1975, 13 years from startup,

00:07:36.701 --> 00:07:39.912
equal opportunity legislation 
came in in Britain

00:07:39.912 --> 00:07:46.824
and that made it illegal to have 
our pro-female policies.

00:07:46.824 --> 00:07:50.400
And as an example of 
unintended consequences,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.072
my female company had to let the men in.

00:07:54.072 --> 00:07:59.014
(Laughter)

00:07:59.014 --> 00:08:01.418
When I started my company of women,

00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:08.317
the men said, "How interesting, because
it only works because it's small."

00:08:08.317 --> 00:08:14.136
And later, as it became sizable, 
they accepted, "Yes, it is sizable now,

00:08:14.136 --> 00:08:17.355
but of no strategic interest."

00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:25.274
And later, when it was a company
valued at over three billion dollars,

00:08:25.274 --> 00:08:29.877
and I'd made 70 of the staff 
into millionaires,

00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:33.397
they sort of said, "Well done, Steve!"

00:08:33.397 --> 00:08:37.683
(Laughter)

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:41.969
(Applause)

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:46.255
You can always tell ambitious women
by the shape of our heads:

00:08:46.255 --> 00:08:49.580
They're flat on top for being 
patted patronizingly.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:55.521
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:55.521 --> 00:09:00.084
And we have larger feet to stand
away from the kitchen sink.

00:09:00.084 --> 00:09:01.737
(Laughter)

00:09:01.737 --> 00:09:05.562
Let me share with you 
two secrets of success:

00:09:05.562 --> 00:09:11.781
Surround yourself with first-class people
and people that you like;

00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:18.065
and choose your partner
very, very carefully.

00:09:18.065 --> 00:09:21.278
Because the other day when I said, 
"My husband's an angel,"

00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:23.764
a woman complained --
"You're lucky," she said,

00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:25.790
"mine's still alive."

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.807
(Laughter)

00:09:33.117 --> 00:09:38.174
If success were easy, 
we'd all be millionaires.

00:09:39.054 --> 00:09:46.048
But in my case, it came in the midst
of family trauma and indeed, crisis.

00:09:49.258 --> 00:09:57.532
Our late son, Giles, was an only child,
a beautiful, contented baby.

00:09:57.532 --> 00:10:01.465
And then, at two and a half,

00:10:01.465 --> 00:10:04.738
like a changeling in a fairy story,

00:10:04.738 --> 00:10:08.170
he lost the little speech that he had

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:13.442
and turned into a wild, 
unmanageable toddler.

00:10:13.442 --> 00:10:15.524
Not the terrible twos;

00:10:15.524 --> 00:10:21.457
he was profoundly autistic 
and he never spoke again.

00:10:24.387 --> 00:10:29.734
Giles was the first resident in the first
house of the first charity that I set up

00:10:29.734 --> 00:10:33.304
to pioneer services for autism.

00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:36.304
And then there's been
a groundbreaking Prior's Court school

00:10:36.304 --> 00:10:38.724
for pupils with autism

00:10:38.724 --> 00:10:42.844
and a medical research charity,
again, all for autism.

00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:47.823
Because whenever I found a gap
in services, I tried to help.

00:10:49.313 --> 00:10:54.583
I like doing new things 
and making new things happen.

00:10:54.583 --> 00:11:01.159
And I've just started a three-year 
think tank for autism.

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:06.434
And so that some of my wealth does go back
to the industry from which it stems,

00:11:06.434 --> 00:11:10.017
I've also founded 
the Oxford Internet Institute

00:11:10.017 --> 00:11:12.510
and other IT ventures.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.795
The Oxford Internet Institute
focuses not on the technology,

00:11:16.795 --> 00:11:21.607
but on the social, economic, legal
and ethical issues of the Internet.

00:11:23.887 --> 00:11:30.909
Giles died unexpectedly 17 years ago now.

00:11:30.909 --> 00:11:34.689
And I have learned to live without him,

00:11:34.689 --> 00:11:39.469
and I have learned to live 
without his need of me.

00:11:39.469 --> 00:11:42.829
Philanthropy is all that I do now.

00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:45.188
I need never worry about getting lost

00:11:45.188 --> 00:11:48.697
because several charities
would quickly come and find me.

00:11:48.697 --> 00:11:52.667
(Laughter)

00:12:00.807 --> 00:12:04.885
It's one thing to have an idea 
for an enterprise,

00:12:04.885 --> 00:12:07.112
but as many people in this room will know,

00:12:07.112 --> 00:12:10.025
making it happen is a very difficult thing

00:12:10.025 --> 00:12:18.117
and it demands extraordinary energy,
self-belief and determination,

00:12:18.117 --> 00:12:22.322
the courage to risk family and home,

00:12:22.322 --> 00:12:27.491
and a 24/7 commitment 
that borders on the obsessive.

00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:31.475
So it's just as well
that I'm a workaholic.

00:12:31.475 --> 00:12:36.706
I believe in the beauty of work when we
do it properly and in humility.

00:12:38.153 --> 00:12:43.522
Work is not just something I do
when I'd rather be doing something else.

00:12:45.612 --> 00:12:47.756
We live our lives forward.

00:12:47.756 --> 00:12:50.990
So what has all that taught me?

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.846
I learned that tomorrow's 
never going to be like today,

00:12:55.846 --> 00:12:58.899
and certainly nothing like yesterday.

00:12:58.899 --> 00:13:02.306
And that made me able to cope with change,

00:13:02.306 --> 00:13:06.634
indeed, eventually to welcome change,

00:13:06.634 --> 00:13:11.666
though I'm told I'm still very difficult.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.801
Thank you very much.

00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:21.081
(Applause)
