00:00:00.903 --> 00:00:07.804
(Clicking)

00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:12.420
I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.353
retinal cancer.

00:00:15.313 --> 00:00:18.419
My right eye was removed

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.336
at seven months of age.

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:25.053
I was 13 months
when they removed my left eye.

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:31.148
The first thing I did
upon awakening from that last surgery

00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:34.780
was to climb out of my crib

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.889
and begin wandering around
the intensive care nursery,

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.208
probably looking for the one
who did this to me.

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:45.066
(Laughter)

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:50.127
Evidently, wandering around the nursery

00:00:50.127 --> 00:00:53.702
was not a problem for me without eyes.

00:00:53.702 --> 00:00:56.337
The problem was getting caught.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.731
It's impressions about blindness

00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:04.221
that are far more threatening

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:07.753
to blind people than the blindness itself.

00:01:09.283 --> 00:01:13.230
Think for a moment about
your own impressions of blindness.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.296
Think about your reactions
when I first came onto the stage,

00:01:17.296 --> 00:01:21.347
or the prospect of your own blindness,

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:25.264
or a loved one going blind.

00:01:25.264 --> 00:01:30.704
The terror is incomprehensible
to most of us,

00:01:30.704 --> 00:01:33.159
because blindness

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.829
is thought to epitomize ignorance
and unawareness,

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:46.630
hapless exposure to the ravages
of the dark unknown.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.460
How poetic.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.801
Fortunately for me,
my parents were not poetic.

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:54.676
They were pragmatic.

00:01:54.676 --> 00:02:01.293
They understood that ignorance and fear
were but matters of the mind,

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:05.282
and the mind is adaptable.

00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:08.983
They believed that I should grow up

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:13.814
to enjoy the same freedoms
and responsibilities as everyone else.

00:02:13.814 --> 00:02:16.275
In their own words, I would move out --

00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:19.062
which I did when I was 18 --

00:02:19.062 --> 00:02:21.035
I will pay taxes --

00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:23.875
thanks --
(Laughter) --

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:30.786
and they knew the difference
between love and fear.

00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:35.710
Fear immobilizes us
in the face of challenge.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.612
They knew that blindness
would pose a significant challenge.

00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:41.666
I was not raised with fear.

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:45.415
They put my freedom first before all else,

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:48.535
because that is what love does.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:52.764
Now, moving forward,
how do I manage today?

00:02:54.044 --> 00:02:57.419
The world is a much larger nursery.

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.320
Fortunately, I have my trusty long cane,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.014
longer than the canes
used by most blind people.

00:03:04.014 --> 00:03:07.357
I call it my freedom staff.

00:03:07.357 --> 00:03:08.913
It will keep me, for example,

00:03:08.913 --> 00:03:14.529
from making an undignified 
departure from the stage. (Laughter)

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.242
I do see that cliff edge.

00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:21.509
They warned us earlier
that every imaginable mishap

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:25.100
has occurred to speakers
up here on the stage.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.121
I don't care to set a new precedent.

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:30.425
But beyond that,

00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:33.552
many of you may have heard me clicking
as I came onto the stage --

00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:34.619
(Clicking) --

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:36.488
with my tongue.

00:03:36.488 --> 00:03:39.666
Those are flashes of sound

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:44.746
that go out and reflect
from surfaces all around me,

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:46.118
just like a bat's sonar,

00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:51.738
and return to me with patterns, 
with pieces of information,

00:03:51.738 --> 00:03:54.225
much as light does for you.

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:58.793
And my brain, thanks to my parents,

00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:04.098
has been activated to form images
in my visual cortex,

00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:07.338
which we now call the imaging system,

00:04:07.338 --> 00:04:11.288
from those patterns of information,
much as your brain does.

00:04:11.288 --> 00:04:13.854
I call this process flash sonar.

00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:20.322
It is how I have learned to see
through my blindness,

00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:23.498
to navigate my journey

00:04:23.498 --> 00:04:27.538
through the dark unknowns
of my own challenges,

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:31.439
which has earned me the moniker

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:35.154
"the remarkable Batman."

00:04:35.154 --> 00:04:37.708
Now, Batman I will accept.

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:41.098
Bats are cool. Batman is cool.

00:04:41.098 --> 00:04:46.766
But I was not raised to think of myself
as in any way remarkable.

00:04:47.856 --> 00:04:51.884
I have always regarded myself
much like anyone else

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:57.300
who navigates the dark unknowns
of their own challenges.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.718
Is that so remarkable?

00:05:00.718 --> 00:05:04.014
I do not use my eyes, I use my brain.

00:05:04.834 --> 00:05:07.317
Now, someone, somewhere,

00:05:07.317 --> 00:05:11.144
must think that's remarkable,
or I wouldn't be up here,

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.183
but let's consider this for a moment.

00:05:15.013 --> 00:05:17.739
Everyone out there

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:22.428
who faces or who has ever
faced a challenge,

00:05:22.428 --> 00:05:24.160
raise your hands.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.490
Whoosh. Okay.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.462
Lots of hands going up, a moment,
let me do a head count.

00:05:30.462 --> 00:05:32.503
(Clicking)

00:05:33.713 --> 00:05:36.731
This will take a while.
(Clicking) (Laughter)

00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:38.205
Okay, lots of hands in the air.

00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:40.609
Keep them up. I have an idea.

00:05:40.609 --> 00:05:46.302
Those of you who use your brains
to navigate these challenges,

00:05:46.302 --> 00:05:49.243
put your hands down.

00:05:50.423 --> 00:05:53.024
Okay, anyone with your hands still up

00:05:53.024 --> 00:05:58.262
has challenges of your own. (Laughter)

00:05:58.262 --> 00:06:00.839
So we all face challenges,

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.577
and we all face the dark unknown,

00:06:04.577 --> 00:06:08.920
which is endemic to most challenges,
which is what most of us fear, okay?

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.773
But we all have brains

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:17.069
that allow us, that activate to allow us

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:23.456
to navigate the journey
through these challenges. Okay?

00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:28.284
Case in point: I came up here

00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:35.254
and -- (Clicking) -- they wouldn't tell me

00:06:35.254 --> 00:06:38.152
where the lectern was.

00:06:38.152 --> 00:06:41.066
So you can't trust those TED folks.

00:06:42.796 --> 00:06:44.653
"Find it yourself," they said.

00:06:44.653 --> 00:06:48.063
So -- (Laughter)

00:06:49.413 --> 00:06:52.525
And the feedback for the P.A. system
is no help at all.

00:06:52.525 --> 00:06:55.934
So now I present to you a challenge.

00:06:55.934 --> 00:06:59.850
So if you'd all close your eyes
for just a moment, okay?

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.507
And you're going to learn
a bit of flash sonar.

00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:05.017
I'm going to make a sound.

00:07:05.017 --> 00:07:08.562
I'm going to hold this panel in front 
of me, but I'm not going to move it.

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:11.486
Just listen to the sound for a moment.

00:07:13.236 --> 00:07:19.228
Shhhhhhhhhh.

00:07:19.228 --> 00:07:21.293
Okay, nothing very interesting.

00:07:21.293 --> 00:07:24.032
Now, listen to what happens
to that same exact sound

00:07:24.032 --> 00:07:25.816
when I move the panel.

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:33.111
Shhhhhhhhhhh. 
(Pitch getting higher and lower)

00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:41.609
You do not know the power
of the dark side.

00:07:41.609 --> 00:07:43.421
(Laughter)

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.812
I couldn't resist.

00:07:47.832 --> 00:07:50.479
Okay, now keep your eyes closed

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:52.327
because, did you hear the difference?

00:07:52.327 --> 00:07:55.425
Okay. Now, let's be sure.

00:07:55.425 --> 00:07:57.224
For your challenge,

00:07:57.224 --> 00:08:02.308
you tell me, just say "now"
when you hear the panel start to move.

00:08:02.308 --> 00:08:05.300
Okay? We'll relax into this.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.823
Shhhhhhh.

00:08:11.823 --> 00:08:13.888
Audience: Now.
Daniel Kish: Good. Excellent.

00:08:13.888 --> 00:08:15.381
Open your eyes.

00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:19.915
All right. So just a few centimeters,

00:08:19.915 --> 00:08:22.045
you would notice the difference.

00:08:22.045 --> 00:08:24.488
You've experienced sonar.

00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:28.547
You'd all make great blind people.
(Laughter)

00:08:28.547 --> 00:08:31.240
Let's have a look at what can happen

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.584
when this activation process

00:08:34.584 --> 00:08:39.111
is given some time and attention.

00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:42.292
(Video) Juan Ruiz: It's like
you guys can see with your eyes

00:08:42.292 --> 00:08:45.497
and we can see with our ears.

00:08:45.497 --> 00:08:48.561
Brian Bushway: It's not a matter
of enjoying it more or less,

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:51.487
it's about enjoying it differently.

00:08:51.487 --> 00:08:54.529
Shawn Marsolais: It goes across.
DK: Yeah.

00:08:54.529 --> 00:08:58.337
SM: And then it's gradually
coming back down again.

00:08:58.337 --> 00:08:59.950
DK: Yes!
SM: That's amazing.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:04.246
I can, like, see the car. Holy mother!

00:09:09.981 --> 00:09:12.048
J. Louchart: I love being blind.

00:09:12.048 --> 00:09:15.716
If I had the opportunity, honestly,
I wouldn't go back to being sighted.

00:09:15.716 --> 00:09:19.176
JR: The bigger the goal,
the more obstacles you'll face,

00:09:19.176 --> 00:09:21.777
and on the other side of that goal

00:09:21.777 --> 00:09:23.425
is victory.

00:09:23.425 --> 00:09:28.580
[In Italian]

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:38.355
(Applause)

00:09:38.355 --> 00:09:42.245
DK: Now, do these people look terrified?

00:09:42.245 --> 00:09:44.067
Not so much.

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:46.853
We have delivered activation training

00:09:46.853 --> 00:09:50.382
to tens of thousands of blind
and sighted people from all backgrounds

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:52.820
in nearly 40 countries.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.302
When blind people learn to see,

00:09:57.302 --> 00:10:00.320
sighted people seem inspired

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.377
to want to learn to see their way
better, more clearly, with less fear,

00:10:06.627 --> 00:10:12.533
because this exemplifies
the immense capacity within us all

00:10:12.533 --> 00:10:19.046
to navigate any type of challenge,
through any form of darkness,

00:10:19.046 --> 00:10:22.332
to discoveries unimagined

00:10:22.332 --> 00:10:27.695
when we are activated.

00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:33.709
I wish you all a most activating journey.

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:35.474
Thank you very much.

00:10:35.474 --> 00:10:42.695
(Applause)

00:10:43.716 --> 00:10:46.162
Chris Anderson: Daniel, my friend.

00:10:46.162 --> 00:10:51.297
As I know you can see, it's
a spectacular standing ovation at TED.

00:10:51.297 --> 00:10:54.281
Thank you for an extraordinary talk.

00:10:54.281 --> 00:10:59.530
Just one more question about your world,
your inner world that you construct.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:05.095
We think that we have things in our world
that you as a blind person don't have,

00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:06.819
but what's your world like?

00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:09.582
What do you have that we don't have?

00:11:09.582 --> 00:11:12.717
DK: Three hundred and sixty-degree view,

00:11:12.717 --> 00:11:16.618
so my sonar works about as well
behind me as it does in front of me.

00:11:16.618 --> 00:11:18.499
It works around corners.

00:11:18.499 --> 00:11:21.238
It works through surfaces.

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:27.229
Generally, it's kind of a fuzzy
three-dimensional geometry.

00:11:27.229 --> 00:11:31.269
One of my students, who has now
become an instructor,

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:34.195
when he lost his vision,
after a few months

00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:36.447
he was sitting in his three story house

00:11:36.447 --> 00:11:40.464
and he realized that he could hear
everything going on throughout the house:

00:11:40.464 --> 00:11:44.643
conversations, people in the kitchen,
people in the bathroom,

00:11:44.643 --> 00:11:47.337
several floors away, several walls away.

00:11:47.337 --> 00:11:50.889
He said it was something
like having x-ray vision.

00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:54.511
CA: What do you picture
that you're in right now?

00:11:54.511 --> 00:11:57.530
How do you picture this theater?

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:03.033
DK: Lots of loudspeakers, quite frankly.

00:12:04.453 --> 00:12:08.709
It's interesting. 
When people make a sound,

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:13.864
when they laugh, when they fidget,
when they take a drink or blow their nose

00:12:13.864 --> 00:12:16.557
or whatever, I hear everything.

00:12:16.557 --> 00:12:19.738
I hear every little movement
that every single person makes.

00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:22.501
None of it really escapes my attention,

00:12:22.501 --> 00:12:24.355
and then, from a sonar perspective,

00:12:24.355 --> 00:12:30.209
the size of the room, the curvature 
of the audience around the stage,

00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:33.847
it's the height of the room.

00:12:33.847 --> 00:12:37.127
Like I say, it's all that kind 
of three-dimensional surface geometry

00:12:37.127 --> 00:12:38.544
all around me.
