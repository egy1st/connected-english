00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:07.398
When I was a kid,

00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:10.959
the disaster we worried about most 
was a nuclear war.

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:15.085
That's why we had a barrel like this
down in our basement,

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:17.656
filled with cans of food and water.

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:19.901
When the nuclear attack came,

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:24.637
we were supposed to go downstairs,
hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:29.597
Today the greatest risk 
of global catastrophe

00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:32.457
doesn't look like this.

00:00:32.457 --> 00:00:35.238
Instead, it looks like this.

00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:41.929
If anything kills over 10 million people
in the next few decades,

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.314
it's most likely to be 
a highly infectious virus

00:00:45.314 --> 00:00:47.792
rather than a war.

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:51.679
Not missiles, but microbes.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.878
Now, part of the reason for this is that

00:00:53.878 --> 00:00:58.081
we've invested a huge amount
in nuclear deterrents.

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:03.179
But we've actually invested very little 
in a system to stop an epidemic.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.093
We're not ready for the next epidemic.

00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:09.758
Let's look at Ebola.

00:01:09.758 --> 00:01:13.615
I'm sure all of you read about it 
in the newspaper,

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.221
lots of tough challenges.

00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:18.876
I followed it carefully 
through the case analysis tools

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:23.721
we use to track polio eradication.

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:25.573
And as you look at what went on,

00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:30.081
the problem wasn't that there was a system
that didn't work well enough,

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.649
the problem was that we 
didn't have a system at all.

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:39.028
In fact, there's some pretty obvious
key missing pieces.

00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:43.940
We didn't have a group of epidemiologists 
ready to go, who would have gone,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.696
seen what the disease was,
seen how far it had spread.

00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:50.452
The case reports came in on paper.

00:01:50.452 --> 00:01:52.808
It was very delayed
before they were put online

00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:54.782
and they were extremely inaccurate.

00:01:55.492 --> 00:01:57.858
We didn't have a medical team ready to go.

00:01:57.858 --> 00:02:00.453
We didn't have a way of preparing people.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:05.784
Now, Médecins Sans Frontières 
did a great job orchestrating volunteers.

00:02:05.784 --> 00:02:08.880
But even so, we were far slower
than we should have been

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.022
getting the thousands of workers
into these countries.

00:02:12.022 --> 00:02:19.007
And a large epidemic would require us
to have hundreds of thousands of workers.

00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:25.155
There was no one there 
to look at treatment approaches.

00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:26.946
No one to look at the diagnostics.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:30.243
No one to figure out 
what tools should be used.

00:02:30.243 --> 00:02:33.723
As an example, we could have 
taken the blood of survivors,

00:02:33.723 --> 00:02:39.158
processed it, and put that plasma
back in people to protect them.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.764
But that was never tried.

00:02:41.764 --> 00:02:43.520
So there was a lot that was missing.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.415
And these things 
are really a global failure.

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:53.873
The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics,
but not to do these things I talked about.

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.842
Now, in the movies it's quite different.

00:02:57.842 --> 00:03:02.674
There's a group of handsome
epidemiologists ready to go,

00:03:02.674 --> 00:03:08.446
they move in, they save the day,
but that's just pure Hollywood.

00:03:10.177 --> 00:03:13.887
The failure to prepare 
could allow the next epidemic

00:03:13.887 --> 00:03:17.695
to be dramatically 
more devastating than Ebola

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:23.531
Let's look at the progression 
of Ebola over this year.

00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.149
About 10,000 people died, 


00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:31.846
and nearly all were in the three
West African countries.

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:34.433
There's three reasons why
it didn't spread more.

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:38.874
The first is that there was a lot 
of heroic work by the health workers.

00:03:38.874 --> 00:03:42.136
They found the people and they 
prevented more infections.

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:44.621
The second is the nature of the virus.

00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.697
Ebola does not spread through the air.

00:03:47.697 --> 00:03:49.810
And by the time you're contagious,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.550
most people are so sick 
that they're bedridden.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.411
Third, it didn't get
into many urban areas.

00:03:58.411 --> 00:04:00.115
And that was just luck.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:02.355
If it had gotten into a lot 
more urban areas,

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:05.877
the case numbers 
would have been much larger.

00:04:05.877 --> 00:04:09.466
So next time, we might not be so lucky.

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:14.530
You can have a virus where people 
feel well enough while they're infectious

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.842
that they get on a plane
or they go to a market.

00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:20.846
The source of the virus could be 
a natural epidemic like Ebola,

00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:22.826
or it could be bioterrorism.

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:27.474
So there are things that would literally
make things a thousand times worse.

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:33.475
In fact, let's look at a model
of a virus spread through the air,

00:04:33.475 --> 00:04:37.070
like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.560
So here's what would happen:

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.558
It would spread throughout the world
very, very quickly.

00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:48.683
And you can see over 30 million people
died from that epidemic.

00:04:48.683 --> 00:04:50.496
So this is a serious problem.

00:04:50.496 --> 00:04:52.257
We should be concerned.

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:56.692
But in fact, we can build
a really good response system.

00:04:56.692 --> 00:05:01.836
We have the benefits of all the science
and technology that we talk about here.

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:02.883
We've got cell phones

00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:06.140
to get information from the public 
and get information out to them.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.319
We have satellite maps where we can see
where people are and where they're moving.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.627
We have advances in biology

00:05:12.627 --> 00:05:16.453
that should dramatically change 
the turnaround time to look at a pathogen

00:05:16.453 --> 00:05:21.322
and be able to make drugs and vaccines
that fit for that pathogen.

00:05:21.322 --> 00:05:22.888
So we can have tools,

00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:27.500
but those tools need to be put
into an overall global health system.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.793
And we need preparedness.

00:05:29.793 --> 00:05:32.257
The best lessons, I think, 
on how to get prepared

00:05:32.257 --> 00:05:34.758
are again, what we do for war.

00:05:34.758 --> 00:05:39.005
For soldiers, we have full-time,
waiting to go.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:42.316
We have reserves that can scale 
us up to large numbers.

00:05:42.316 --> 00:05:46.005
NATO has a mobile unit 
that can deploy very rapidly.

00:05:46.005 --> 00:05:49.455
NATO does a lot of war games 
to check, are people well trained?

00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:51.883
Do they understand 
about fuel and logistics

00:05:51.883 --> 00:05:54.241
and the same radio frequencies?

00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:56.779
So they are absolutely ready to go.

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:01.134
So those are the kinds of things
we need to deal with an epidemic.

00:06:01.134 --> 00:06:03.301
What are the key pieces?

00:06:03.301 --> 00:06:08.591
First, we need strong health systems
in poor countries.

00:06:08.591 --> 00:06:11.778
That's where mothers 
can give birth safely,

00:06:11.778 --> 00:06:13.295
kids can get all their vaccines.

00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:17.634
But, also where we'll see 
the outbreak very early on.

00:06:18.154 --> 00:06:19.935
We need a medical reserve corps:

00:06:19.935 --> 00:06:22.501
lots of people who've got 
the training and background

00:06:22.501 --> 00:06:25.853
who are ready to go, with the expertise.

00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:30.266
And then we need to pair those
medical people with the military.

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:34.417
taking advantage of the military's ability
to move fast, do logistics

00:06:34.417 --> 00:06:36.220
and secure areas.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.129
We need to do simulations,

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.927
germ games, not war games,
so that we see where the holes are.

00:06:43.927 --> 00:06:46.723
The last time a germ game 
was done in the United States

00:06:46.723 --> 00:06:50.443
was back in 2001, 
and it didn't go so well.

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:55.490
So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.609
Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;D
in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.

00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:05.246
There are some big breakthroughs, 
like the Adeno-associated virus,

00:07:05.246 --> 00:07:09.229
that could work very, very quickly.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:12.599
Now I don't have an exact budget
for what this would cost,

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:17.095
but I'm quite sure it's very modest
compared to the potential harm.

00:07:17.095 --> 00:07:21.740
The World Bank estimates that 
if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.465
global wealth will go down
by over three trillion dollars

00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:29.332
and we'd have millions
and millions of deaths.

00:07:29.332 --> 00:07:32.317
These investments 
offer significant benefits

00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:34.518
beyond just being ready for the epidemic.

00:07:34.518 --> 00:07:36.982
The primary healthcare, the R&amp;D,

00:07:36.982 --> 00:07:39.812
those things would reduce 
global health equity

00:07:39.812 --> 00:07:43.502
and make the world more just 
as well as more safe.

00:07:43.502 --> 00:07:46.864
So I think this should absolutely
be a priority.

00:07:47.514 --> 00:07:48.980
There's no need to panic.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.469
We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti
or go down into the basement.

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:57.309
But we need to get going,
because time is not on our side.

00:07:57.309 --> 00:08:03.524
In fact, if there's one positive thing
that can come out of the Ebola epidemic,

00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:09.330
it's that it can serve as an early 
warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.978
If we start now, we can be ready 
for the next epidemic.

00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:16.574
Thank you.

00:08:16.574 --> 00:08:19.868
(Applause)
