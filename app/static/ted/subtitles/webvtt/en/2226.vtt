WEBVTT

00:00:00.764 --> 00:00:02.923
G'day, my name's Kevin.

00:00:02.923 --> 00:00:05.616
I'm from Australia. I'm here to help.

00:00:05.616 --> 00:00:08.147
(Laughter)

00:00:08.147 --> 00:00:12.814
Tonight, I want to talk about
a tale of two cities.

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:18.248
One of those cities is called Washington,
and the other is called Beijing.

00:00:18.248 --> 00:00:24.284
Because how these two capitals
shape their future

00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:27.489
and the future of the United States
and the future of China

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.578
doesn't just affect those two countries,

00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:31.900
it affects all of us

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.780
in ways, perhaps, we've never thought of:

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.145
the air we breathe, the water we drink,

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:42.279
the fish we eat,
the quality of our oceans,

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:45.948
the languages we speak in the future,

00:00:45.948 --> 00:00:48.873
the jobs we have,
the political systems we choose,

00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:54.024
and, of course, the great questions
of war and peace.

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:57.279
You see that bloke? He's French.

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:59.109
His name is Napoleon.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.645
A couple of hundred years ago,

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:03.083
he made this extraordinary projection:

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.707
"China is a sleeping lion,
and when she awakes,

00:01:05.707 --> 00:01:07.913
the world will shake."

00:01:07.913 --> 00:01:10.096
Napoleon got a few things wrong;

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:12.789
he got this one absolutely right.

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.061
Because China is today
not just woken up,

00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.521
China has stood up
and China is on the march,

00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:22.541
and the question for us all

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:24.515
is where will China go

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:28.563
and how do we engage
this giant of the 21st century?

00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:35.381
You start looking at the numbers,
they start to confront you in a big way.

00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:38.492
It's projected that China will become,

00:01:38.492 --> 00:01:41.906
by whichever measure --
PPP, market exchange rates --

00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:43.833
the largest economy in the world

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:46.039
over the course of the decade ahead.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.190
They're already
the largest trading nation,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.341
already the largest exporting nation,

00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:52.494
already the largest manufacturing nation,

00:01:52.494 --> 00:01:56.859
and they're also the biggest
emitters of carbon in the world.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.343
America comes second.

00:01:59.343 --> 00:02:04.869
So if China does become
the world's largest economy,

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.495
think about this:

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:09.513
It'll be the first time

00:02:09.513 --> 00:02:14.180
since this guy was on
the throne of England --

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.663
George III, not a good friend
of Napoleon's --

00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:23.102
that in the world we will have
as the largest economy

00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:25.488
a non-English speaking country,

00:02:25.488 --> 00:02:27.694
a non-Western country,

00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:30.021
a non-liberal democratic country.

00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:32.314
And if you don't think
that's going to affect

00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:35.077
the way in which the world
happens in the future,

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:38.305
then personally, I think
you've been smoking something,

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:42.925
and it doesn't mean you're from Colorado.

00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:45.711
So in short, the question
we have tonight is,

00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:48.707
how do we understand this mega-change,

00:02:48.707 --> 00:02:53.490
which I believe to be the biggest change
for the first half of the 21st century?

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.415
It'll affect so many things.

00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:58.157
It will go to the absolute core.

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:00.804
It's happening quietly.
It's happening persistently.

00:03:00.804 --> 00:03:03.358
It's happening in some senses
under the radar,

00:03:03.358 --> 00:03:05.103
as we are all preoccupied with

00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:07.932
what's going in Ukraine,
what's going on in the Middle East,

00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:10.440
what's going on with ISIS,
what's going on with ISIL,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.412
what's happening with
the future of our economies.

00:03:13.412 --> 00:03:17.684
This is a slow and quiet revolution.

00:03:17.684 --> 00:03:23.373
And with a mega-change
comes also a mega-challenge,

00:03:23.373 --> 00:03:25.044
and the mega-challenge is this:

00:03:25.044 --> 00:03:27.297
Can these two great countries,

00:03:27.297 --> 00:03:29.897
China and the United States --

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:34.525
China,

00:03:35.725 --> 00:03:37.374
the Middle Kingdom,

00:03:37.374 --> 00:03:39.929
and the United States,

00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:45.547
Měiguó --

00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:48.890
which in Chinese, by the way,
means "the beautiful country."

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.514
Think about that -- that's the name
that China has given this country

00:03:52.514 --> 00:03:54.254
for more than a hundred years.

00:03:54.254 --> 00:03:57.853
Whether these two great civilizations,
these two great countries,

00:03:57.853 --> 00:04:02.056
can in fact carve out a common future

00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:04.633
for themselves and for the world?

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:07.605
In short, can we carve out a future

00:04:07.605 --> 00:04:11.044
which is peaceful and mutually prosperous,

00:04:11.044 --> 00:04:12.948
or are we looking at a great challenge

00:04:12.948 --> 00:04:15.316
of war or peace?

00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:17.940
And I have 15 minutes
to work through war or peace,

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.493
which is a little less time

00:04:21.493 --> 00:04:26.486
than they gave this guy to write a book
called "War and Peace."

00:04:26.486 --> 00:04:30.664
People ask me, why is it that a kid
growing up in rural Australia

00:04:30.664 --> 00:04:32.452
got interested in learning Chinese?

00:04:32.452 --> 00:04:34.310
Well, there are two reasons for that.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.936
Here's the first of them.

00:04:35.936 --> 00:04:37.955
That's Betsy the cow.

00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:41.880
Now, Betsy the cow was one
of a herd of dairy cattle

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.050
that I grew up with on a farm
in rural Australia.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.543
See those hands there?
These are not built for farming.

00:04:48.543 --> 00:04:52.281
So very early on, I discovered
that in fact, working in a farm

00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:55.927
was not designed for me,
and China was a very safe remove

00:04:55.927 --> 00:04:58.318
from any career in Australian farm life.

00:04:58.318 --> 00:05:00.013
Here's the second reason.

00:05:00.013 --> 00:05:00.918
That's my mom.

00:05:00.918 --> 00:05:03.682
Anyone here ever listen
to what their mom told them to do?

00:05:03.682 --> 00:05:06.352
Everyone ever do what
their mom told them to do?

00:05:06.352 --> 00:05:08.256
I rarely did,

00:05:08.256 --> 00:05:10.151
but what my mom said to me was,

00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:13.030
one day, she handed me a newspaper,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.881
a headline which said,
here we have a huge change.

00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:24.274
And that change is China
entering the United Nations.

00:05:24.274 --> 00:05:27.193
1971, I had just turned 14 years of age,

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:29.470
and she handed me this headline.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.657
And she said, "Understand this, 
learn this,

00:05:31.657 --> 00:05:34.563
because it's going to affect your future."

00:05:34.563 --> 00:05:38.361
So being a very good student of history,

00:05:38.361 --> 00:05:41.032
I decided that the best thing
for me to do was, in fact,

00:05:41.032 --> 00:05:43.284
to go off and learn Chinese.

00:05:43.284 --> 00:05:45.397
The great thing about learning Chinese

00:05:45.397 --> 00:05:48.508
is that your Chinese teacher
gives you a new name.

00:05:48.508 --> 00:05:51.434
And so they gave me this name:

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:56.565
Kè, which means to overcome or to conquer,

00:05:56.565 --> 00:06:01.163
and Wén, and that's the character
for literature or the arts.

00:06:01.163 --> 00:06:05.528
Kè Wén, Conqueror of the Classics.

00:06:05.528 --> 00:06:08.175
Any of you guys called "Kevin"?

00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:12.256
It's a major lift from being called Kevin
to be called Conqueror of the Classics.

00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:13.907
(Laughter)

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:15.649
I've been called Kevin all my life.

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:17.637
Have you been called Kevin all your life?

00:06:17.637 --> 00:06:20.838
Would you prefer to be called
Conqueror of the Classics?

00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:24.396
And so I went off after that
and joined the Australian Foreign Service,

00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:31.022
but here is where pride -- before pride,
there always comes a fall.

00:06:31.022 --> 00:06:33.530
So there I am in the embassy in Beijing,

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.736
off to the Great Hall of the People

00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:39.130
with our ambassador, who had asked me
to interpret for his first meeting

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.146
in the Great Hall of the People.

00:06:41.146 --> 00:06:42.634
And so there was I.

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:45.475
If you've been to a Chinese meeting,
it's a giant horseshoe.

00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:48.353
At the head of the horsehoe
are the really serious pooh-bahs,

00:06:48.353 --> 00:06:51.515
and down the end of the horseshoe
are the not-so-serious pooh-bahs,

00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:53.940
the junior woodchucks like me.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.726
And so the ambassador
began with this inelegant phrase.

00:06:56.726 --> 00:07:01.370
He said, "China and Australia
are currently enjoying a relationship

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.922
of unprecedented closeness."

00:07:04.922 --> 00:07:06.408
And I thought to myself,

00:07:06.408 --> 00:07:10.170
"That sounds clumsy. That sounds odd.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.468
I will improve it."

00:07:12.468 --> 00:07:15.202
Note to file: Never do that.

00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:18.191
It needed to be a little more elegant,
a little more classical,

00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:20.490
so I rendered it as follows.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.621
[In Chinese]

00:07:25.621 --> 00:07:28.848
There was a big pause
on the other side of the room.

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:32.633
You could see the giant pooh-bahs
at the head of the horseshoe,

00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:35.628
the blood visibly draining
from their faces,

00:07:35.628 --> 00:07:38.577
and the junior woodchucks
at the other end of the horseshoe

00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:41.364
engaged in peals of 
unrestrained laughter.

00:07:41.364 --> 00:07:43.158
Because when I rendered his sentence,

00:07:43.158 --> 00:07:45.473
"Australia and China are 
enjoying a relationship

00:07:45.473 --> 00:07:47.558
of unprecedented closeness,"

00:07:47.558 --> 00:07:50.024
in fact, what I said was that
Australia and China

00:07:50.024 --> 00:07:53.252
were now experiencing fantastic orgasm.

00:07:53.252 --> 00:07:56.316
(Laughter)

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:03.050
That was the last time
I was asked to interpret.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.558
But in that little story,
there's a wisdom, which is,

00:08:05.558 --> 00:08:09.412
as soon as you think you know something
about this extraordinary civilization

00:08:09.412 --> 00:08:11.618
of 5,000 years of continuing history,

00:08:11.618 --> 00:08:14.090
there's always something new to learn.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.678
History is against us

00:08:17.678 --> 00:08:19.907
when it comes to the U.S. and China

00:08:19.907 --> 00:08:22.206
forging a common future together.

00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:23.644
This guy up here?

00:08:23.644 --> 00:08:25.573
He's not Chinese and he's not American.

00:08:25.573 --> 00:08:27.802
He's Greek. His name's Thucydides.

00:08:27.802 --> 00:08:30.286
He wrote the history
of the Peloponnesian Wars.

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:33.064
And he made this extraordinary observation


00:08:33.064 --> 00:08:35.412
about Athens and Sparta.

00:08:35.412 --> 00:08:38.622
"It was the rise of Athens
and the fear that this inspired in Sparta

00:08:38.622 --> 00:08:40.154
that made war inevitable."

00:08:40.154 --> 00:08:45.471
And hence, a whole literature about
something called the Thucydides Trap.

00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:49.303
This guy here? He's not American
and he's not Greek. He's Chinese.

00:08:49.303 --> 00:08:51.674
His name is Sun Tzu.
He wrote "The Art of War,"

00:08:51.674 --> 00:08:55.197
and if you see his statement underneath,
it's along these lines:

00:08:55.197 --> 00:09:00.424
"Attack him where he is unprepared,
appear where you are not expected."

00:09:00.424 --> 00:09:04.430
Not looking good so far
for China and the United States.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.309
This guy is an American.
His name's Graham Allison.

00:09:07.309 --> 00:09:09.909
In fact, he's a teacher
at the Kennedy School

00:09:09.909 --> 00:09:11.187
over there in Boston.

00:09:11.187 --> 00:09:14.159
He's working on a single project
at the moment, which is,

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:17.340
does the Thucydides Trap
about the inevitably of war

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.428
between rising powers
and established great powers

00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:23.400
apply to the future
of China-U.S. relations?

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.819
It's a core question.

00:09:24.819 --> 00:09:28.860
And what Graham has done
is explore 15 cases in history

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.321
since the 1500s

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.852
to establish what the precedents are.

00:09:33.852 --> 00:09:35.848
And in 11 out of 15 of them,

00:09:35.848 --> 00:09:37.915
let me tell you,

00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:41.050
they've ended in catastrophic war.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.486
You may say, "But Kevin --

00:09:44.486 --> 00:09:46.785
or Conqueror of the Classics --

00:09:46.785 --> 00:09:48.967
that was the past.

00:09:48.967 --> 00:09:52.102
We live now in a world
of interdependence and globalization.

00:09:52.102 --> 00:09:53.565
It could never happen again."

00:09:53.565 --> 00:09:54.911
Guess what?

00:09:54.911 --> 00:09:57.581
The economic historians
tell us that in fact,

00:09:57.581 --> 00:09:59.900
the time which we reached
the greatest point

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.719
of economic integration and globalization

00:10:02.719 --> 00:10:05.290
was in 1914,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:09.423
just before that happened, World War I,

00:10:09.423 --> 00:10:12.511
a sobering reflection from history.

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:15.065
So if we are engaged
in this great question

00:10:15.065 --> 00:10:18.270
of how China thinks, feels,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.147
and positions itself
towards the United States,

00:10:22.147 --> 00:10:23.633
and the reverse,

00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:25.514
how do we get to the baseline

00:10:25.514 --> 00:10:28.904
of how these two countries
and civilizations

00:10:28.904 --> 00:10:31.830
can possibly work together?

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.128
Let me first go to, in fact,

00:10:34.128 --> 00:10:36.729
China's views of the U.S.
and the rest of the West.

00:10:36.729 --> 00:10:39.604
Number one: China feels
as if it's been humiliated

00:10:39.604 --> 00:10:42.487
at the hands of the West
through a hundred years of history,

00:10:42.487 --> 00:10:44.275
beginning with the Opium Wars.

00:10:44.275 --> 00:10:48.083
When after that, the Western powers
carved China up into little pieces,

00:10:48.083 --> 00:10:50.614
so that by the time
it got to the '20s and '30s,

00:10:50.614 --> 00:10:53.291
signs like this one appeared
on the streets of Shanghai.

00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:54.786
["No dogs and Chinese allowed"]

00:10:54.786 --> 00:10:56.756
How would you feel if you were Chinese, 


00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:59.539
in your own country, 
if you saw that sign appear?

00:10:59.539 --> 00:11:03.407
China also believes and feels

00:11:03.407 --> 00:11:08.028
as if, in the events of 1919,
at the Peace Conference in Paris,

00:11:08.028 --> 00:11:09.924
when Germany's colonies were given back

00:11:09.924 --> 00:11:12.068
to all sorts of countries
around in the world,

00:11:12.068 --> 00:11:13.926
what about German colonies in China?

00:11:13.926 --> 00:11:16.480
They were, in fact, given to Japan.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.589
When Japan then invaded China in the 1930s

00:11:20.589 --> 00:11:24.257
the world looked away and was indifferent
to what would happen to China.

00:11:24.257 --> 00:11:27.114
And then, on top of that,
the Chinese to this day believe

00:11:27.114 --> 00:11:28.801
that the United States and the West

00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:31.333
do not accept the legitimacy
of their political system

00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:34.223
because it's so radically different
from those of us who come

00:11:34.223 --> 00:11:35.513
from liberal democracies,

00:11:35.513 --> 00:11:38.329
and believe that the United States
to this day is seeking

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:40.767
to undermine their political system.

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:43.785
China also believes
that it is being contained

00:11:43.785 --> 00:11:48.638
by U.S. allies and by those
with strategic partnerships with the U.S.

00:11:48.638 --> 00:11:51.262
right around its periphery.

00:11:51.262 --> 00:11:53.746
And beyond all that,
the Chinese have this feeling

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:56.974
in their heart of hearts
and in their gut of guts

00:11:56.974 --> 00:12:01.176
that those of us in the collective West

00:12:01.176 --> 00:12:04.868
are just too damned arrogant.

00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:08.815
That is, we don't recognize
the problems in our own system,

00:12:08.815 --> 00:12:10.673
in our politics and our economics,

00:12:10.673 --> 00:12:13.064
and are very quick
to point the finger elsewhere,

00:12:13.064 --> 00:12:16.826
and believe that, in fact,
we in the collective West

00:12:16.826 --> 00:12:20.634
are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy.

00:12:20.634 --> 00:12:24.047
Of course, in international relations,

00:12:24.047 --> 00:12:28.006
it's not just the sound
of one hand clapping.

00:12:28.006 --> 00:12:30.688
There's another country too,
and that's called the U.S.

00:12:30.688 --> 00:12:33.242
So how does the U.S.
respond to all of the above?

00:12:33.242 --> 00:12:35.378
The U.S. has a response to each of those.

00:12:35.378 --> 00:12:37.881
On the question of
is the U.S. containing China,

00:12:37.881 --> 00:12:41.559
they say, "No, look at the history of
the Soviet Union. That was containment."

00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:43.969
Instead, what we have done
in the U.S. and the West

00:12:43.969 --> 00:12:45.943
is welcome China
into the global economy,

00:12:45.943 --> 00:12:49.379
and on top of that, welcome them
into the World Trade Organization.

00:12:49.379 --> 00:12:51.252
The U.S. and the West say China cheats

00:12:51.252 --> 00:12:53.558
on the question
of intellectual property rights,

00:12:53.558 --> 00:12:57.877
and through cyberattacks
on U.S. and global firms.

00:12:57.877 --> 00:13:01.453
Furthermore, the United States
says that the Chinese political system

00:13:01.453 --> 00:13:04.332
is fundamentally wrong

00:13:04.332 --> 00:13:07.629
because it's at such fundamental variance

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:10.880
to the human rights, democracy,
and rule of law that we enjoy

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.504
in the U.S. and the collective West.

00:13:13.504 --> 00:13:16.661
And on top of all the above,
what does the United States say?

00:13:16.661 --> 00:13:21.769
That they fear that China will,
when it has sufficient power,

00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:25.786
establish a sphere of influence
in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia,

00:13:25.786 --> 00:13:27.690
boot the United States out,

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.710
and in time, when it's powerful enough,

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.719
unilaterally seek to change
the rules of the global order.

00:13:33.719 --> 00:13:36.421
So apart from all of that,
it's just fine and dandy,

00:13:36.421 --> 00:13:37.815
the U.S.-China relationship.

00:13:37.815 --> 00:13:40.020
No real problems there.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.942
The challenge, though,
is given those deep-rooted feelings,

00:13:44.942 --> 00:13:47.937
those deep-rooted emotions
and thought patterns,

00:13:47.937 --> 00:13:50.747
what the Chinese call "Sīwéi,"
ways of thinking,

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:55.205
how can we craft a basis
for a common future between these two?

00:13:55.205 --> 00:13:56.836
I argue simply this:

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.781
We can do it on the basis on a framework

00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:03.356
of constructive realism
for a common purpose.

00:14:03.356 --> 00:14:05.329
What do I mean by that?

00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:07.674
Be realistic about the things
that we disagree on,

00:14:07.674 --> 00:14:09.949
and a management approach
that doesn't enable

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:12.805
any one of those differences
to break into war or conflict

00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:16.358
until we've acquired
the diplomatic skills to solve them.

00:14:16.358 --> 00:14:20.014
Be constructive in areas of the
bilateral, regional and global engagement

00:14:20.014 --> 00:14:21.386
between the two,

00:14:21.386 --> 00:14:24.113
which will make a difference
for all of humankind.

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:28.106
Build a regional institution
capable of cooperation in Asia,

00:14:28.106 --> 00:14:30.034
an Asia-Pacific community.

00:14:30.034 --> 00:14:32.448
And worldwide, act further,

00:14:32.448 --> 00:14:35.072
like you've begun to do
at the end of last year

00:14:35.072 --> 00:14:37.301
by striking out against climate change

00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:41.295
with hands joined together
rather than fists apart.

00:14:41.295 --> 00:14:44.197
Of course, all that happens
if you've got a common mechanism

00:14:44.197 --> 00:14:46.310
and political will to achieve the above.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.004
These things are deliverable.

00:14:49.004 --> 00:14:53.020
But the question is,
are they deliverable alone?

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.969
This is what our head
tells us we need to do,

00:14:55.969 --> 00:14:57.873
but what about our heart?

00:14:57.873 --> 00:15:00.915
I have a little experience
in the question back home

00:15:00.915 --> 00:15:04.235
of how you try to bring
together two peoples

00:15:04.235 --> 00:15:07.857
who, frankly, haven't had
a whole lot in common in the past.

00:15:07.857 --> 00:15:11.434
And that's when I apologized
to Australia's indigenous peoples.

00:15:11.434 --> 00:15:15.219
This was a day of reckoning
in the Australian government,

00:15:15.219 --> 00:15:17.911
the Australian parliament,
and for the Australian people.

00:15:17.911 --> 00:15:22.694
After 200 years of unbridled abuse
towards the first Australians,

00:15:22.694 --> 00:15:27.872
it was high time that we white folks
said we were sorry.

00:15:27.872 --> 00:15:29.242
The important thing --

00:15:29.242 --> 00:15:34.288
(Applause)

00:15:34.288 --> 00:15:37.210
The important thing that I remember
is staring in the faces

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.691
of all those from Aboriginal Australia

00:15:39.691 --> 00:15:42.500
as they came to listen to this apology.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.308
It was extraordinary to see, for example,

00:15:46.308 --> 00:15:50.232
old women telling me the stories
of when they were five years old

00:15:50.232 --> 00:15:53.228
and literally ripped away
from their parents,

00:15:53.228 --> 00:15:54.829
like this lady here.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:58.962
It was extraordinary for me
to then be able to embrace

00:15:58.962 --> 00:16:02.910
and to kiss Aboriginal elders
as they came into the parliament building,

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.166
and one woman said to me,

00:16:04.166 --> 00:16:07.321
it's the first time a white fella
had ever kissed her in her life,

00:16:07.321 --> 00:16:09.272
and she was over 70.

00:16:09.272 --> 00:16:11.779
That's a terrible story.

00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:14.241
And then I remember
this family saying to me,

00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:18.304
"You know, we drove all the way
from the far North down to Canberra

00:16:18.304 --> 00:16:19.674
to come to this thing,

00:16:19.674 --> 00:16:21.857
drove our way through redneck country.

00:16:21.857 --> 00:16:28.474
On the way back, stopped at a cafe
after the apology for a milkshake."

00:16:28.474 --> 00:16:34.046
And they walked into this cafe
quietly, tentatively, gingerly,

00:16:34.046 --> 00:16:35.509
a little anxious.

00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:38.063
I think you know what I'm talking about.

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:41.871
But the day after the apology,
what happened?

00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:45.981
Everyone in that cafe,
every one of the white folks,

00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:48.767
stood up and applauded.

00:16:48.767 --> 00:16:53.903
Something had happened in the hearts
of these people in Australia.

00:16:53.903 --> 00:16:56.592
The white folks, our Aboriginal
brothers and sisters,

00:16:56.592 --> 00:16:59.820
and we haven't solved
all these problems together,

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.488
but let me tell you,
there was a new beginning

00:17:03.488 --> 00:17:05.904
because we had gone not just to the head,

00:17:05.904 --> 00:17:08.562
we'd gone also to the heart.

00:17:08.562 --> 00:17:11.433
So where does that conclude
in terms of the great question

00:17:11.433 --> 00:17:13.620
that we've been asked
to address this evening,

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.584
which is the future
of U.S.-China relations?

00:17:16.584 --> 00:17:18.883
The head says there's a way forward.

00:17:18.883 --> 00:17:22.574
The head says there is a policy framework,
there's a common narrative,

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:24.501
there's a mechanism
through regular summitry

00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:26.405
to do these things
and to make them better.

00:17:26.405 --> 00:17:31.978
But the heart must also find a way
to reimagine the possibilities

00:17:31.978 --> 00:17:33.882
of the America-China relationship,

00:17:33.882 --> 00:17:37.542
and the possibilities of China's
future engagement in the world.

00:17:37.542 --> 00:17:43.625
Sometimes, folks, we just need
to take a leap of faith

00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:47.549
not quite knowing where we might land.

00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:51.822
In China, they now talk about
the Chinese Dream.

00:17:51.822 --> 00:17:57.348
In America, we're all familiar
with the term "the American Dream."

00:17:57.348 --> 00:18:00.482
I think it's time, across the world,

00:18:00.482 --> 00:18:05.614
that we're able to think also
of something we might also call

00:18:05.614 --> 00:18:10.756
a dream for all humankind.

00:18:11.368 --> 00:18:13.327
Because if we do that,

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:15.977
we might just change the way

00:18:15.977 --> 00:18:20.529
that we think about each other.

00:18:23.923 --> 00:18:27.034
[In Chinese]

00:18:27.034 --> 00:18:30.401
That's my challenge to America.
That's my challenge to China.

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:32.885
That's my challenge to all of us,

00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:36.182
but I think where there's a will
and where there is imagination

00:18:36.182 --> 00:18:38.226
we can turn this into a future

00:18:38.226 --> 00:18:40.571
driven by peace and prosperity

00:18:40.571 --> 00:18:42.591
and not once again repeat

00:18:42.591 --> 00:18:44.704
the tragedies of war.

00:18:44.704 --> 00:18:46.562
I thank you.

00:18:46.562 --> 00:18:51.997
(Applause)

00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:55.176
Chris Anderson: Thanks so much for that.
Thanks so much for that.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:59.773
It feels like you yourself
have a role to play in this bridging.

00:18:59.773 --> 00:19:04.124
You, in a way, are uniquely placed
to speak to both sides.

00:19:04.124 --> 00:19:07.377
Kevin Rudd: Well, what we Australians
do best is organize the drinks,

00:19:07.377 --> 00:19:10.904
so you get them together in one room,
and we suggest this and suggest that,

00:19:10.904 --> 00:19:12.337
then we go and get the drinks.

00:19:12.337 --> 00:19:14.341
But no, look, for all of us
who are friends

00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:16.603
of these two great countries,
America and China,

00:19:16.603 --> 00:19:17.942
you can do something.

00:19:17.942 --> 00:19:20.241
You can make a practical contribution,

00:19:20.241 --> 00:19:22.122
and for all you good folks here,

00:19:22.122 --> 00:19:23.747
next time you meet someone from China,

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.359
sit down and have a conversation.

00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:28.814
See what you can find out about
where they come from and what they think,

00:19:28.814 --> 00:19:30.852
and my challenge for all
the Chinese folks

00:19:30.852 --> 00:19:33.181
who are going to watch
this TED Talk at some time

00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:35.542
is do the same.
