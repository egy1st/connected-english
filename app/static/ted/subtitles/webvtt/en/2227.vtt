00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:03.416
We're at a tipping point in human history,

00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:08.943
a species poised between gaining the stars
and losing the planet we call home.

00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:12.062
Even in just the past few years,
we've greatly expanded

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:16.392
our knowledge of how Earth fits
within the context of our universe.

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:19.130
NASA's Kepler mission has discovered

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.079
thousands of potential planets
around other stars,

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.273
indicating that Earth is but one
of billions of planets in our galaxy.

00:00:26.273 --> 00:00:28.143
Kepler is a space telescope

00:00:28.143 --> 00:00:32.434
that measures the subtle dimming of stars
as planets pass in front of them,

00:00:32.434 --> 00:00:35.282
blocking just a little bit
of that light from reaching us.

00:00:35.732 --> 00:00:38.332
Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes

00:00:38.332 --> 00:00:41.118
as well as their distance
from their parent star.

00:00:41.118 --> 00:00:45.158
Together, this helps us understand
whether these planets are small and rocky,

00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:47.713
like the terrestrial planets
in our own Solar System,

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:51.079
and also how much light they receive
from their parent sun.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.957
In turn, this provides clues as to whether
these planets that we discover

00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:57.418
might be habitable or not.

00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:01.481
Unfortunately, at the same time
as we're discovering this treasure trove

00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:03.594
of potentially habitable worlds,

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:07.054
our own planet is sagging
under the weight of humanity.

00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:11.466
2014 was the hottest year on record.

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:14.809
Glaciers and sea ice that have
been with us for millennia

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:17.944
are now disappearing
in a matter of decades.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:23.055
These planetary-scale environmental 
changes that we have set in motion

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:26.527
are rapidly outpacing our ability
to alter their course.

00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:31.062
But I'm not a climate scientist,
I'm an astronomer.

00:01:31.062 --> 00:01:34.432
I study planetary habitability
as influenced by stars

00:01:34.432 --> 00:01:36.890
with the hopes of finding
the places in the universe

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.862
where we might discover
life beyond our own planet.

00:01:39.862 --> 00:01:43.402
You could say that I look for
choice alien real estate.

00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:48.244
Now, as somebody who is deeply embedded
in the search for life in the universe,

00:01:48.244 --> 00:01:51.611
I can tell you that the more
you look for planets like Earth,

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:55.257
the more you appreciate
our own planet itself.

00:01:55.257 --> 00:01:57.950
Each one of these new worlds
invites a comparison

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.572
between the newly discovered planet
and the planets we know best:

00:02:01.572 --> 00:02:03.662
those of our own Solar System.

00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:05.624
Consider our neighbor, Mars.

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:09.409
Mars is small and rocky,
and though it's a bit far from the Sun,

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.934
it might be considered
a potentially habitable world

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:13.936
if found by a mission like Kepler.

00:02:13.936 --> 00:02:17.303
Indeed, it's possible that Mars
was habitable in the past,

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.740
and in part, this is why
we study Mars so much.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.130
Our rovers, like Curiosity,
crawl across its surface,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.380
scratching for clues as to the origins
of life as we know it.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.886
Orbiters like the MAVEN mission
sample the Martian atmosphere,

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:34.578
trying to understand how Mars
might have lost its past habitability.

00:02:34.578 --> 00:02:39.143
Private spaceflight companies now offer
not just a short trip to near space

00:02:39.143 --> 00:02:42.844
but the tantalizing possibility
of living our lives on Mars.

00:02:42.844 --> 00:02:44.794
But though these Martian vistas

00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:47.349
resemble the deserts
of our own home world,

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.921
places that are tied in our imagination
to ideas about pioneering and frontiers,

00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:54.593
compared to Earth

00:02:54.593 --> 00:02:57.890
Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.164
Consider the extent to which
we have not colonized

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:03.068
the deserts of our own planet,

00:03:03.068 --> 00:03:05.901
places that are lush
by comparison with Mars.

00:03:05.901 --> 00:03:08.687
Even in the driest,
highest places on Earth,

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:11.287
the air is sweet and thick with oxygen

00:03:11.287 --> 00:03:15.374
exhaled from thousands of miles away
by our rainforests.

00:03:15.374 --> 00:03:21.318
I worry -- I worry that this excitement
about colonizing Mars and other planets

00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:24.429
carries with it a long, dark shadow:

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:26.449
the implication and belief by some

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.002
that Mars will be there to save us
from the self-inflicted destruction

00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:34.135
of the only truly habitable planet
we know of, the Earth.

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:36.573
As much as I love
interplanetary exploration,

00:03:36.573 --> 00:03:38.918
I deeply disagree with this idea.

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:41.611
There are many excellent reasons
to go to Mars,

00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:45.025
but for anyone to tell you that Mars
will be there to back up humanity

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:48.133
is like the captain of the Titanic
telling you that the real party

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.504
is happening later on the lifeboats.

00:03:50.504 --> 00:03:53.453
(Laughter)

00:03:53.453 --> 00:03:56.355
(Applause)

00:03:56.355 --> 00:03:59.142
Thank you.

00:03:59.142 --> 00:04:02.928
But the goals of interplanetary
exploration and planetary preservation

00:04:02.928 --> 00:04:05.109
are not opposed to one another.

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.640
No, they're in fact two sides
of the same goal:

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.982
to understand, preserve
and improve life into the future.

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:16.045
The extreme environments
of our own world are alien vistas.

00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:17.926
They're just closer to home.

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:22.105
If we can understand how to create
and maintain habitable spaces

00:04:22.105 --> 00:04:25.495
out of hostile, inhospitable
spaces here on Earth,

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:28.932
perhaps we can meet the needs
of both preserving our own environment

00:04:28.932 --> 00:04:31.161
and moving beyond it.

00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:33.471
I leave you with a final
thought experiment:

00:04:33.471 --> 00:04:35.166
Fermi's paradox.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:40.028
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi
asked that, given the fact

00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:42.875
that our universe has been around
for a very long time

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:45.545
and we expect that there
are many planets within it,

00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:48.633
we should have found evidence
for alien life by now.

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:50.676
So where are they?

00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:54.043
Well, one possible solution
to Fermi's paradox

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:57.526
is that, as civilizations become
technologically advanced enough

00:04:57.526 --> 00:04:59.848
to consider living amongst the stars,

00:04:59.848 --> 00:05:02.332
they lose sight of how important it is

00:05:02.332 --> 00:05:06.860
to safeguard the home worlds that fostered
that advancement to begin with.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.248
It is hubris to believe
that interplanetary colonization alone

00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:13.129
will save us from ourselves,

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.658
but planetary preservation
and interplanetary exploration

00:05:16.658 --> 00:05:18.552
can work together.

00:05:18.552 --> 00:05:20.675
If we truly believe in our ability

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:24.181
to bend the hostile environments of Mars
for human habitation,

00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:27.767
then we should be able to surmount
the far easier task of preserving

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:29.940
the habitability of the Earth.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.986
Thank you.

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:37.516
(Applause)
