00:00:01.354 --> 00:00:05.950
Virtual reality started for me
in sort of an unusual place.

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:09.173
It was the 1970s.

00:00:09.173 --> 00:00:12.383
I got into the field very young:
I was seven years old.

00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:17.245
And the tool that I used 
to access virtual reality

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:20.810
was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.201
This is a commercial for 
that particular item:

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:24.776
(Video) Voice-over: What a jump!

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:26.767
Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:29.536
That gyro-power sends him 
over 100 feet at top speed.

00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:31.628
Chris Milk: So this was my joy back then.

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:34.587
I rode this motorcycle everywhere.

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:38.847
And I was there with Evel Knievel; we 
jumped the Snake River Canyon together.

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:40.216
I wanted the rocket.

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:42.996
I never got the rocket,
I only got the motorcycle.

00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:48.203
I felt so connected to this world.

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:52.440
I didn't want to be a storyteller 
when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.644
I was there. Evel Knievel was my friend.

00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:58.027
I had so much empathy for him.

00:00:58.747 --> 00:01:01.358
But it didn't work out. (Laughter)

00:01:01.358 --> 00:01:03.382
I went to art school.

00:01:03.382 --> 00:01:05.792
I started making music videos.

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:08.866
And this is one of the early
music videos that I made:

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:14.756
(Music: "Touch the Sky" by Kanye West)

00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:18.032
CM: You may notice 
some slight similarities here.

00:01:18.032 --> 00:01:19.818
(Laughter)

00:01:19.818 --> 00:01:22.461
And I got that rocket.

00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:25.104
(Laughter)

00:01:25.104 --> 00:01:29.509
So, now I'm a filmmaker,
or, the beginning of a filmmaker,

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.243
and I started using the tools that are
available to me as a filmmaker

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:37.831
to try to tell the most compelling stories
that I can to an audience.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.980
And film is this incredible medium
that allows us to feel empathy

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.006
for people that are very different than us

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.838
and worlds completely 
foreign from our own.

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:46.668
Unfortunately,

00:01:46.668 --> 00:01:51.527
Evel Knievel did not feel the same 
empathy for us that we felt for him,

00:01:51.527 --> 00:01:54.330
and he sued us for this video --

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.061
(Laughter) --

00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:58.110
shortly thereafter.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.950
On the upside, the man 
that I worshipped as a child,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.066
the man that I wanted 
to become as an adult,

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:09.906
I was finally able to get his autograph.

00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:13.902
(Applause)

00:02:17.832 --> 00:02:22.849
Let's talk about film now.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.745
Film, it's an incredible medium,

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:29.060
but essentially, it's the same
now as it was then.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.529
It's a group of rectangles that are
played in a sequence.

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:36.362
And we've done incredible things
with those rectangles.

00:02:36.362 --> 00:02:39.247
But I started thinking about,

00:02:39.247 --> 00:02:43.616
is there a way that I can use modern
and developing technologies

00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:45.741
to tell stories in different ways

00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:47.482
and tell different kinds of stories

00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:51.793
that maybe I couldn't tell using
the traditional tools of filmmaking

00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:53.964
that we've been using for 100 years?

00:02:53.964 --> 00:02:56.785
So I started experimenting,

00:02:56.785 --> 00:03:01.874
and what I was trying to do was
to build the ultimate empathy machine.

00:03:03.054 --> 00:03:05.588
And here's one of the early experiments:

00:03:05.588 --> 00:03:08.412
(Music)

00:03:08.412 --> 00:03:10.656
So this is called
"The Wilderness Downtown."

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:12.712
It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.

00:03:12.712 --> 00:03:16.362
It asked you to put in the address
where you grew up at the beginning of it.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:17.359
It's a website.

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.275
And out of it starts growing these little
boxes with different browser windows.

00:03:22.275 --> 00:03:24.657
And you see this teenager 
running down a street,

00:03:24.657 --> 00:03:27.415
and then you see Google Street View
and Google Maps imagery

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.939
and you realize the street
he's running down is yours.

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.048
And when he stops in front of a house,
he stops in front of your house.

00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:39.417
And this was great, and I saw people 
having an even deeper emotional reaction

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:42.631
to this than the things that 
I had made in rectangles.

00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:46.562
And I'm essentially taking 
a piece of your history

00:03:46.562 --> 00:03:49.981
and putting it inside 
the framing of the story.

00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:51.578
But then I started thinking,

00:03:51.578 --> 00:03:53.430
okay, well that's a part of you,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.731
but how do I put all of you
inside of the frame?

00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:01.834
So to do that, I started
making art installations.

00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:04.374
And this is one called 
"The Treachery of Sanctuary."

00:04:04.374 --> 00:04:07.392
It's a triptych. I'm going to show
you the third panel.

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:11.230
(Music)

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.848
So now I've got you inside of the frame,

00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:39.403
and I saw people having even more
visceral emotional reactions

00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:42.080
to this work than the previous one.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.230
But then I started thinking about frames,
and what do they represent?

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.487
And a frame is just a window.

00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:51.566
I mean, all the media that we watch --
television, cinema --

00:04:51.566 --> 00:04:53.819
they're these windows into 
these other worlds.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.507
And I thought, well, great. 
I got you in a frame.

00:04:56.507 --> 00:04:59.634
But I don't want you in the frame,
I don't want you in the window,

00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:02.523
I want you through the window,
I want you on the other side,

00:05:02.523 --> 00:05:05.598
in the world, inhabiting the world.

00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:09.123
So that leads me back to virtual reality.

00:05:09.123 --> 00:05:11.344
Let's talk about virtual reality.

00:05:12.634 --> 00:05:13.934
Unfortunately,


00:05:13.934 --> 00:05:18.423
talking about virtual reality
is like dancing about architecture.

00:05:18.423 --> 00:05:25.340
And this is actually someone dancing
about architecture in virtual reality.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.823
(Laughter)

00:05:27.823 --> 00:05:31.084
So, it's difficult to explain.
Why is it difficult to explain?

00:05:31.084 --> 00:05:34.782
It's difficult because it's a very 
experiential medium.

00:05:34.782 --> 00:05:36.698
You feel your way inside of it.

00:05:36.698 --> 00:05:38.496
It's a machine, but inside of it,

00:05:38.496 --> 00:05:41.945
it feels like real life,
it feels like truth.

00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:44.466
And you feel present in the world
that you're inside

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:47.689
and you feel present with the people
that you're inside of it with.


00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.785
So, I'm going to show you a demo
of a virtual reality film:

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:54.006
a full-screen version of
all the information

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:56.209
that we capture when
we shoot virtual reality.

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:58.034
So we're shooting in every direction.

00:05:58.034 --> 00:06:00.210
This is a camera system that we built

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.235
that has 3D cameras that look
in every direction

00:06:03.235 --> 00:06:05.987
and binaural microphones
that face in every direction.

00:06:05.987 --> 00:06:11.333
We take this and we build, basically,
a sphere of a world that you inhabit.

00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:14.736
So what I'm going to show you
is not a view into the world,

00:06:14.736 --> 00:06:18.107
it's basically the whole world
stretched into a rectangle.

00:06:18.107 --> 00:06:21.495
So this film is called 
"Clouds Over Sidra,"

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:25.989
and it was made in conjunction with 
our virtual reality company called VRSE

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:27.755
and the United Nations,

00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:30.788
and a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.

00:06:30.788 --> 00:06:34.625
And we went to a Syrian refugee camp
in Jordan in December

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:38.982
and shot the story of a 12-year-old
girl there named Sidra.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:42.473
And she and her family fled Syria
through the desert into Jordan

00:06:42.473 --> 00:06:46.567
and she's been living in this
camp for the last year and a half.

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:50.720
(Video) Sidra: My name is Sidra.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.616
I am 12 years old.

00:06:52.616 --> 00:06:54.418
I am in the fifth grade.

00:06:54.418 --> 00:06:59.605
I am from Syria,
in the Daraa Province, Inkhil City.

00:06:59.605 --> 00:07:04.843
I have lived here in the Zaatari camp
in Jordan for the last year and a half.

00:07:06.923 --> 00:07:08.931
I have a big family:


00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:11.697
three brothers, one is a baby.

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:15.142
He cries a lot.

00:07:15.142 --> 00:07:20.197
I asked my father if I cried when 
I was a baby and he says I did not.

00:07:20.197 --> 00:07:23.821
I think I was a stronger baby
than my brother.

00:07:23.821 --> 00:07:26.731
CM: So, when you're inside 
of the headset.

00:07:26.731 --> 00:07:28.351
you're not seeing it like this.

00:07:28.351 --> 00:07:30.423
You're looking around through this world.

00:07:30.423 --> 00:07:35.711
You'll notice you see full
360 degrees, in all directions.

00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:38.702
And when you're sitting there
in her room, watching her,

00:07:38.702 --> 00:07:41.115
you're not watching it through
a television screen,

00:07:41.115 --> 00:07:44.523
you're not watching it through a window,
you're sitting there with her.

00:07:44.523 --> 00:07:48.896
When you look down, you're sitting
on the same ground that she's sitting on.

00:07:48.915 --> 00:07:50.666
And because of that,

00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:55.054
you feel her humanity in a deeper way.

00:07:55.054 --> 00:07:59.590
You empathize with her in a deeper way.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:05.917
And I think that we can change
minds with this machine.

00:08:05.917 --> 00:08:09.690
And we've already started
to try to change a few.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.536
So we took this film to the World Economic
Forum in Davos in January.

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:17.022
And we showed it to a group of people

00:08:17.022 --> 00:08:21.102
whose decisions affect the lives
of millions of people.

00:08:21.102 --> 00:08:23.220
And these are people 
who might not otherwise

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:29.484
be sitting in a tent 
in a refugee camp in Jordan.

00:08:29.484 --> 00:08:35.813
But in January, one afternoon
in Switzerland,

00:08:35.813 --> 00:08:39.429
they suddenly all found themselves there.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:44.489
(Applause)

00:08:46.699 --> 00:08:49.058
And they were affected by it.

00:08:49.058 --> 00:08:52.374
So we're going to make more of them.

00:08:52.374 --> 00:08:55.460
We're working with the 
United Nations right now

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.515
to shoot a whole series of these films.

00:08:57.515 --> 00:09:00.187
We just finished shooting
a story in Liberia.

00:09:00.187 --> 00:09:03.633
And now, we're going 
to shoot a story in India.

00:09:03.633 --> 00:09:05.511
And we're taking these films,

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:08.036
and we're showing them 
at the United Nations

00:09:08.036 --> 00:09:11.023
to people that work there and people
that are visiting there.

00:09:11.023 --> 00:09:12.810
And we're showing 
them to the people

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:17.274
that can actually change the lives
of the people inside of the films.

00:09:17.274 --> 00:09:20.955
And that's where I think we just
start to scratch the surface

00:09:20.955 --> 00:09:24.614
of the true power of virtual reality.

00:09:24.614 --> 00:09:26.835
It's not a video game peripheral.

00:09:26.835 --> 00:09:31.408
It connects humans to other humans
in a profound way

00:09:31.408 --> 00:09:34.873
that I've never seen before 
in any other form of media.

00:09:34.873 --> 00:09:38.612
And it can change people's
perception of each other.

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:40.298
And that's how I think

00:09:40.298 --> 00:09:43.734
virtual reality has the potential
to actually change the world.

00:09:46.604 --> 00:09:49.151
So, it's a machine,

00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:54.074
but through this machine
we become more compassionate,

00:09:54.074 --> 00:09:59.667
we become more empathetic,
and we become more connected.

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:03.521
And ultimately, we become more human.

00:10:04.491 --> 00:10:05.651
Thank you.

00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:08.771
(Applause)
