00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:03.571
It would be nice to be
objective in life,

00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:05.593
in many ways.

00:00:05.593 --> 00:00:08.971
The problem is that we have
these color-tinted glasses

00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:13.650
as we look at all kinds of situations.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.366
For example, think about
something as simple as beer.

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.548
If I gave you a few beers to taste

00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:23.356
and I asked you to rate them
on intensity and bitterness,

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:27.053
different beers would occupy
different space.

00:00:27.053 --> 00:00:29.810
But what if we tried
to be objective about it?

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.970
In the case of beer,
it would be very simple.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.122
What if we did a blind taste?

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:36.846
Well, if we did the same thing,
you tasted the same beer,

00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:40.817
now in the blind taste,
things would look slightly different.

00:00:40.817 --> 00:00:43.039
Most of the beers will go into one place.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.484
You will basically not
be able to distinguish them,

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:48.573
and the exception, of course,
will be Guinness.

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:50.801
(Laughter)

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:53.587
Similarly, we can think about physiology.

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:56.629
What happens when people expect
something from their physiology?

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.137
For example, we sold people
pain medications.

00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:01.876
Some people, we told them
the medications were expensive.

00:01:01.876 --> 00:01:03.757
Some people, we told them it was cheap.

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:06.729
And the expensive
pain medication worked better.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.283
It relieved more pain from people,

00:01:09.283 --> 00:01:12.787
because expectations
do change our physiology.

00:01:12.787 --> 00:01:14.849
And of course, we all know that in sports,

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:16.667
if you are a fan of a particular team,

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.036
you can't help but see the game

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:22.541
develop from the perspective of your team.

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:26.717
So all of those are cases in which
our preconceived notions

00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:30.157
and our expectations color our world.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:33.559
But what happened
in more important questions?

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:37.111
What happened with questions
that had to do with social justice?

00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:40.516
So we wanted to think about
what is the blind tasting version

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:43.581
for thinking about inequality?

00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:45.880
So we started looking at inequality,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.830
and we did some large-scale surveys

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.384
around the U.S. and other countries.

00:01:50.384 --> 00:01:52.335
So we asked two questions:

00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:55.701
Do people know what kind of
level of inequality we have?

00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:59.812
And then, what level of inequality
do we want to have?

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:02.226
So let's think about the first question.

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:04.339
Imagine I took all the people in the U.S.

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:07.264
and I sorted them from
the poorest on the right

00:02:07.264 --> 00:02:09.656
to the richest on the left,

00:02:09.656 --> 00:02:12.318
and then I divided them into five buckets:

00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:14.616
the poorest 20 percent,
the next 20 percent,

00:02:14.616 --> 00:02:17.472
the next, the next,
and the richest 20 percent.

00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:20.468
And then I asked you to tell me
how much wealth do you think

00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:23.417
is concentrated in each of those buckets.

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:25.878
So to make it simpler,
imagine I ask you to tell me,

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:28.138
how much wealth do you think
is concentrated

00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:30.398
in the bottom two buckets,

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:32.659
the bottom 40 percent?

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.351
Take a second. Think about it
and have a number.

00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:37.255
Usually we don't think.

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:39.740
Think for a second,
have a real number in your mind.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.365
You have it?

00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:44.430
Okay, here's what lots
of Americans tell us.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.357
They think that the bottom 20 percent

00:02:46.357 --> 00:02:48.679
has about 2.9 percent of the wealth,

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:50.862
the next group has 6.4,

00:02:50.862 --> 00:02:53.369
so together it's slightly more than nine.

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.782
The next group, they say, has 12 percent,

00:02:56.782 --> 00:02:58.431
20 percent,

00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:03.075
and the richest 20 percent, people think
has 58 percent of the wealth.

00:03:03.075 --> 00:03:06.210
You can see how this relates
to what you thought.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.951
Now, what's reality?

00:03:07.951 --> 00:03:09.762
Reality is slightly different.

00:03:09.762 --> 00:03:13.575
The bottom 20 percent
has 0.1 percent of the wealth.

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:16.826
The next 20 percent
has 0.2 percent of the wealth.

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:18.939
Together, it's 0.3.

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.468
The next group has 3.9,

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:24.651
11.3,

00:03:24.651 --> 00:03:30.392
and the richest group
has 84-85 percent of the wealth.

00:03:30.392 --> 00:03:33.358
So what we actually have
and what we think we have

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:35.331
are very different.

00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:37.421
What about what we want?

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:39.418
How do we even figure this out?

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:40.829
So to look at this,

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.407
to look at what we really want,

00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:45.472
we thought about
the philosopher John Rawls.

00:03:45.472 --> 00:03:47.307
If you remember John Rawls,

00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:50.557
he had this notion
of what's a just society.

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:52.039
He said a just society

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:54.754
is a society that if
you knew everything about it,

00:03:54.754 --> 00:03:57.187
you would be willing
to enter it in a random place.

00:03:57.187 --> 00:03:58.711
And it's a beautiful definition,

00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:01.189
because if you're wealthy,
you might want the wealthy

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.226
to have more money, the poor to have less.

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:05.335
If you're poor, you might
want more equality.

00:04:05.335 --> 00:04:07.339
But if you're going
to go into that society

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:10.659
in every possible situation,
and you don't know,

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.865
you have to consider all the aspects.

00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:15.791
It's a little bit like blind tasting
in which you don't know

00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:18.461
what the outcome will be
when you make a decision,

00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:22.176
and Rawls called this
the "veil of ignorance."

00:04:22.176 --> 00:04:25.783
So, we took another group,
a large group of Americans,

00:04:25.783 --> 00:04:28.538
and we asked them the question
in the veil of ignorance.

00:04:28.538 --> 00:04:32.648
What are the characteristics of a country
that would make you want to join it,

00:04:32.648 --> 00:04:35.806
knowing that you could end
randomly at any place?

00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:37.285
And here is what we got.

00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:39.544
What did people want to give
to the first group,

00:04:39.544 --> 00:04:41.727
the bottom 20 percent?

00:04:41.727 --> 00:04:44.421
They wanted to give them
about 10 percent of the wealth.

00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:47.021
The next group, 14 percent of the wealth,

00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:52.384
21, 22 and 32.

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:55.890
Now, nobody in our sample
wanted full equality.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.323
Nobody thought that socialism
is a fantastic idea in our sample.

00:05:00.323 --> 00:05:01.611
But what does it mean?


00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:03.649
It means that we have this knowledge gap

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:06.307
between what we have
and what we think we have,

00:05:06.307 --> 00:05:10.022
but we have at least as big a gap
between what we think is right

00:05:10.022 --> 00:05:12.820
to what we think we have.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.012
Now, we can ask these questions,
by the way, not just about wealth.

00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:18.427
We can ask it about other things as well.

00:05:18.427 --> 00:05:22.630
So for example, we asked people
from different parts of the world

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.348
about this question,

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:26.691
people who are liberals and conservatives,

00:05:26.691 --> 00:05:28.735
and they gave us basically 
the same answer.

00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:31.217
We asked rich and poor,
they gave us the same answer,

00:05:31.217 --> 00:05:32.518
men and women,

00:05:32.518 --> 00:05:35.211
NPR listeners and Forbes readers.

00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:38.440
We asked people in England,
Australia, the U.S. --

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.157
very similar answers.

00:05:40.157 --> 00:05:42.928
We even asked different
departments of a university.

00:05:42.928 --> 00:05:45.686
We went to Harvard and we checked
almost every department,

00:05:45.686 --> 00:05:47.698
and in fact, from Harvard Business School,

00:05:47.698 --> 00:05:51.410
where a few people wanted the wealthy
to have more and the [poor] to have less,

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.950
the similarity was astonishing.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.774
I know some of you went
to Harvard Business School.

00:05:56.774 --> 00:06:00.120
We also asked this question
about something else.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.089
We asked, what about the ratio
of CEO pay to unskilled workers?

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:08.246
So you can see what
people think is the ratio,

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:12.147
and then we can ask the question,
what do they think should be the ratio?

00:06:12.147 --> 00:06:14.774
And then we can ask, what is reality?

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:18.052
What is reality? And you could say,
well, it's not that bad, right?

00:06:18.052 --> 00:06:20.205
The red and the yellow
are not that different.

00:06:20.205 --> 00:06:24.125
But the fact is, it's because
I didn't draw them on the same scale.

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:30.015
It's hard to see, there's yellow
and blue in there.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.360
So what about other outcomes of wealth?

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.055
Wealth is not just about wealth.

00:06:34.055 --> 00:06:36.679
We asked, what about things like health?

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:40.812
What about availability
of prescription medication?

00:06:40.812 --> 00:06:42.832
What about life expectancy?

00:06:42.832 --> 00:06:45.247
What about life expectancy of infants?

00:06:45.247 --> 00:06:47.592
How do we want this to be distributed?

00:06:47.592 --> 00:06:50.401
What about education for young people?

00:06:50.401 --> 00:06:52.271
And for older people?

00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:55.254
And across all of those things,
what we learned was that people

00:06:55.254 --> 00:06:58.412
don't like inequality of wealth,

00:06:58.412 --> 00:07:01.918
but there's other things where inequality,
which is an outcome of wealth,

00:07:01.918 --> 00:07:03.961
is even more aversive to them:

00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:07.932
for example, inequality
in health or education.

00:07:07.932 --> 00:07:10.393
We also learned that people
are particularly open

00:07:10.393 --> 00:07:12.947
to changes in equality
when it comes to people

00:07:12.947 --> 00:07:14.991
who have less agency --

00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:17.336
basically, young kids and babies,

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:22.003
because we don't think of them
as responsible for their situation.

00:07:22.003 --> 00:07:24.348
So what are some lessons from this?

00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:25.508
We have two gaps:

00:07:25.508 --> 00:07:28.088
We have a knowledge gap
and we have a desirability gap

00:07:28.088 --> 00:07:30.710
And the knowledge gap
is something that we think about,

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.080
how do we educate people?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.796
How do we get people to think
differently about inequality

00:07:34.796 --> 00:07:38.558
and the consequences of inequality
in terms of health, education,

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:40.949
jealousy, crime rate, and so on?

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:42.830
Then we have the desirability gap.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.653
How do we get people to think differently
about what we really want?

00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:50.028
You see, the Rawls definition,
the Rawls way of looking at the world,

00:07:50.028 --> 00:07:51.770
the blind tasting approach,

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.695
takes our selfish motivation
out of the picture.

00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:57.272
How do we implement that
to a higher degree

00:07:57.272 --> 00:07:59.896
on a more extensive scale?

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.752
And finally, we also have an action gap.

00:08:02.752 --> 00:08:05.701
How do we take these things
and actually do something about it?

00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:08.603
I think part of the answer
is to think about people

00:08:08.603 --> 00:08:11.715
like young kids and babies
that don't have much agency,

00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:15.523
because people seem to be
more willing to do this.

00:08:15.523 --> 00:08:20.793
To summarize, I would say,
next time you go to drink beer or wine,

00:08:20.793 --> 00:08:24.880
first of all, think about, what is it
in your experience that is real,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.154
and what is it in your experience
that is a placebo effect

00:08:28.154 --> 00:08:29.758
coming from expectations?

00:08:29.758 --> 00:08:33.287
And then think about what it also means
for other decisions in your life,

00:08:33.287 --> 00:08:35.362
and hopefully also for policy questions


00:08:35.362 --> 00:08:36.667
that affect all of us.

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:38.394
Thanks a lot.

00:08:38.394 --> 00:08:40.731
(Applause)
