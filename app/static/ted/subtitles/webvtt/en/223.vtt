00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it's something we just kind of learned for this,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Nice show. Man, that was good!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
DH: Thank you.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You actually just did that. (Laughter)

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ...

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
DH: All right, let's show them something special.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ...

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
he has invented and working on.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
DH: A type of juggling I actually invented,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
right after I saw another juggler do it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
BF: Shut up. (Laughter)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
(Laughter)

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
(Applause)

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but it certainly slows it down.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
BF: Oh yeah, it does. (Drum roll)

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
BF: Oh, Daniel.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
(Applause)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
DH: One more? (Drum roll)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Perfect. (Drum roll)

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Perfect. (Drum roll)

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
BF: OK. DH: Oh! All right.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
(Applause)

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
over three with my right hand. (Drum roll)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
BF: Also three with his left.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
DH: Perfect.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
(Laughter)

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
or should I miss once on purpose? (Laughter)

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
BF: First try? Once on purpose?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
(Audience: Once on purpose!)

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
DH: How about if I try first and then decide?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
BF: Good idea. (Laughter) Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
DH: He's looking at me.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
BF: That's all right, he does that. All right.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
DH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help. (Laughter)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Oh, good. All right.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And then we thought, "How stupid."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
BF: I think that's the next session.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
DH: Next session?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
BF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
He actually assumes more of the danger in this.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
DH: Please stand up, Richard. (Whip cracks)

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Oh, sorry. (Laughter)

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
DH: Now Richard, please ... (Whip cracks)

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
BF: OK, sorry.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Richard Wurman: Can I say something?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
BF: Sure.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the things that have happened to me --

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
DH: All right, please stand here in front ...

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
(Laughter)

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
BF: No, come stay up with him.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It's kind of neat. OK.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
(Laughter)

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
DH: Wow, you've been working out.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
BF: No, shut up!

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
(Laughter)

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
OK, here we go.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Have him hold your wrist so I can ...

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
There you go.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
(Laughter)

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
OK.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
OK, hold on.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
RW: Hmmm.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
(Laughter)

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
DH: First one.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
(Laughter)

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
(Laughter)

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
What happened there?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
BF: I think we were just outside.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
DH: I don't get it. (Applause)

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
(Laughter)

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
BF: Here we go, I'm taking it. (Balloon pops) (Applause)

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
DH: One more, one more.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
BF: We've got one more we're going to do.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
RW: Do I get to hold them?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
(Laughter)

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
(Laughter)

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
(Applause)

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000
(Laughter)

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
(Laughter)

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Could you just push that?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
(Applause)

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
DH: Wow! Boy!

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
(Laughter)

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
DH: Let's jump this way, though.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ...

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
(Laughter)

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
DH: True. Barry ...

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
BF: I'm going to run up behind him.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
DH: Leap over my shoulder.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
BF: Up and over his shoulders.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
(Laughter)

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Still juggling. (Laughter)

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Impossible, you say?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
BF: Incredible, you say?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
DH: Why bother, you say?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
BF: Here we go.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
BF: This guy, this guy invented air.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
DH: I think so, that's right.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Even the pencil.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
BF: He invented the pencil.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
it took us over 10 years to perfect.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Actually, we will take a second to prove --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
up onto the stage?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
(Laughter)

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Or a virgin for a sacrifice?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
BF: Anything?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
DH: Where's Gloria? (Laughter)

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
BF: No, she's got ... farm animal.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
DH: Do you have a small farm animal?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
BF: Over the top, over the top.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
BF: Yeah, it's all right.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ...

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
BF: Yeah, a little sketchy.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
DH: Everything up here's OK?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
BF: Yeah.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
DH: Then here we go.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
point that a little more directly

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
into my eyeballs? Is that possible? (Laughter) I can still see a little.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
We went too far. (Laughter)

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The design of the body is a whole different thing.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
DH: May we have our jumping music please? (Silence)

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
May we have it a bit louder?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
(Laughter)

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
BF: They're a good crew! Whoa!

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
DH: Whoa, sorry. All right.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
BF: We're going on.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
DH: All right, we'll try again.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
BF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
DH: All right, here we go. Sorry about that.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
DH: Whenever you're ready.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
BF: There we go!

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
(Applause)

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.000
All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Somebody dance! Come on!

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
(Applause)

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Wow, wow, OK, stop.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this. (Laughter)

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I think that's uncomfortable for everyone.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
DH: The French judge ...

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
BF: One more quick thing.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
(Laughter)

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
BF: Well, you know ...

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
that we've won two world juggling championships.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
We're going to show you right now

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
an excerpt from a routine that we used

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
to wipe out the other juggling team competition.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
DH: That's right.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
BF: Good.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
(Laughter)

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
BF: Juggling's got a bad rap.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And look, it has a twin!

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
BF: Shut up. (Laughter)

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
DH: There's still one more by my foot.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
What do you want me to do with it?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year. (Laughter)

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
BF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000
DH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
BF: Nice.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
DH: I got that --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
BF: Nice.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
BF: It's progress, that's the thing.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
(Laughter)

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
DH: How about that? I'll do it again.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And it's awfully windy over there.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
BF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
it would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
DH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Oh, look how it lies there.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
(Laughter)

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Too much Olympics.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
DH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
What gem of knowledge?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
What pearl of wisdom?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Is that your final answer?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
DH: I do, I do.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
DH: We will juggle seven.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
BF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
BF: Yes.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Put your tongue away, Barry.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
BF: Oh, oh, whoa.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000
(Applause)

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:32.000
DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Because now, to make this twice as difficult,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
we'll juggle the seven clubs back ...

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
BF: Seven-club juggling.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
DH: ... to back.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
BF: Thank you, that's it.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
BF: Thank you guys!

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
DH: Thank you very much!
