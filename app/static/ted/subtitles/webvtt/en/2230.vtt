00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:05.514
I'd like to take you on the epic quest
of the Rosetta spacecraft.

00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:09.540
To escort and land the probe on a comet,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.730
this has been my passion
for the past two years.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.545
In order to do that,

00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:18.015
I need to explain to you something
about the origin of the solar system.

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:20.238
When we go back
four and a half billion years,

00:00:20.238 --> 00:00:21.957
there was a cloud of gas and dust.

00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:26.484
In the center of this cloud,
our sun formed and ignited.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:32.195
Along with that, what we now know
as planets, comets and asteroids formed.

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:35.608
What then happened, according to theory,

00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:39.625
is that when the Earth had cooled down
a bit after its formation,

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:44.396
comets massively impacted the Earth
and delivered water to Earth.

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:49.516
They probably also delivered
complex organic material to Earth,

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.906
and that may have bootstrapped
the emergence of life.

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:56.366
You can compare this to having
to solve a 250-piece puzzle

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.570
and not a 2,000-piece puzzle.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.053
Afterwards, the big planets
like Jupiter and Saturn,

00:01:03.053 --> 00:01:05.631
they were not in their place
where they are now,

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.278
and they interacted gravitationally,

00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:11.830
and they swept the whole interior
of the solar system clean,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.432
and what we now know as comets

00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:15.545
ended up in something
called the Kuiper Belt,

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:19.213
which is a belt of objects
beyond the orbit of Neptune.

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:22.906
And sometimes these objects
run into each other,

00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:25.971
and they gravitationally deflect,

00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:30.428
and then the gravity of Jupiter
pulls them back into the solar system.

00:01:30.428 --> 00:01:34.120
And they then become the comets
as we see them in the sky.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.394
The important thing here to note
is that in the meantime,

00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:39.693
the four and a half billion years,

00:01:39.693 --> 00:01:42.875
these comets have been sitting
on the outside of the solar system,

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:44.290
and haven't changed --

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.193
deep, frozen versions of our solar system.

00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:49.282
In the sky, they look like this.

00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:51.233
We know them for their tails.

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:52.904
There are actually two tails.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:56.759
One is a dust tail,
which is blown away by the solar wind.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.404
The other one is an ion tail,
which is charged particles,

00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:03.143
and they follow the magnetic field
in the solar system.

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:04.292
There's the coma,

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:07.199
and then there is the nucleus,
which here is too small to see,

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:09.689
and you have to remember
that in the case of Rosetta,

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.866
the spacecraft is in that center pixel.

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:15.976
We are only 20, 30, 40 kilometers
away from the comet.

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:18.297
So what's important to remember?

00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:23.166
Comets contain the original material
from which our solar system was formed,

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.526
so they're ideal to study the components

00:02:25.526 --> 00:02:29.791
that were present at the time 
when Earth, and life, started.

00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:31.673
Comets are also suspected

00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:35.944
of having brought the elements
which may have bootstrapped life.

00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:40.309
In 1983, ESA set up
its long-term Horizon 2000 program,

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:44.233
which contained one cornerstone,
which would be a mission to a comet.

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:49.123
In parallel, a small mission to a comet,
what you see here, Giotto, was launched,

00:02:49.123 --> 00:02:55.329
and in 1986, flew by the comet of Halley
with an armada of other spacecraft.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.900
From the results of that mission,
it became immediately clear

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.087
that comets were ideal bodies to study
to understand our solar system.

00:03:04.087 --> 00:03:08.599
And thus, the Rosetta mission
was approved in 1993,

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.234
and originally it was supposed
to be launched in 2003,

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:14.858
but a problem arose
with an Ariane rocket.

00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:17.923
However, our P.R. department,
in its enthusiasm,

00:03:17.923 --> 00:03:20.145
had already made
1,000 Delft Blue plates

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:22.535
with the name of the wrong comets.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:26.102
So I've never had to buy any china since.
That's the positive part.

00:03:26.102 --> 00:03:27.821
(Laughter)

00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:29.701
Once the whole problem was solved,

00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:32.882
we left Earth in 2004

00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:35.970
to the newly selected comet,
Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.826
This comet had to be specially selected

00:03:38.826 --> 00:03:41.480
because A, you have to
be able to get to it,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.261
and B, it shouldn't have been
in the solar system too long.

00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:48.208
This particular comet has been 
in the solar system since 1959.

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:51.523
That's the first time
when it was deflected by Jupiter,

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:54.500
and it got close enough
to the sun to start changing.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.151
So it's a very fresh comet.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.502
Rosetta made a few historic firsts.

00:03:59.502 --> 00:04:02.018
It's the first satellite to orbit a comet,

00:04:02.018 --> 00:04:05.640
and to escort it throughout
its whole tour through the solar system --

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.938
closest approach to the sun,
as we will see in August,

00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:11.259
and then away again to the exterior.

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.860
It's the first ever landing on a comet.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.552
We actually orbit the comet
using something which is not

00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:19.001
normally done with spacecraft.

00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.636
Normally, you look at the sky and you know
where you point and where you are.

00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:24.772
In this case, that's not enough.

00:04:24.772 --> 00:04:28.070
We navigated by looking
at landmarks on the comet.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.545
We recognized features --
boulders, craters --

00:04:30.545 --> 00:04:34.562
and that's how we know where we are
respective to the comet.

00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:39.091
And, of course, it's the first satellite
to go beyond the orbit of Jupiter

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:40.292
on solar cells.

00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:42.619
Now, this sounds more heroic
than it actually is,

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:47.715
because the technology
to use radio isotope thermal generators

00:04:47.715 --> 00:04:51.013
wasn't available in Europe at that time,
so there was no choice.

00:04:51.013 --> 00:04:52.590
But these solar arrays are big.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.865
This is one wing, and these are not
specially selected small people.

00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:57.699
They're just like you and me.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.090
(Laughter)

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.291
We have two of these wings,
65 square meters.

00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:07.310
Now later on, of course,
when we got to the comet,

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.839
you find out that 65 square meters of sail

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:16.481
close to a body which is outgassing
is not always a very handy choice.

00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.525
Now, how did we get to the comet?

00:05:18.525 --> 00:05:22.193
Because we had to go there
for the Rosetta scientific objectives

00:05:22.193 --> 00:05:26.001
very far away -- four times the distance
of the Earth to the sun --

00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:30.111
and also at a much higher velocity
than we could achieve with fuel,

00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:34.430
because we'd have to take six times as
much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.840
So what do you do?

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.323
You use gravitational flybys, slingshots,

00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:42.690
where you pass by a planet
at very low altitude,

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.455
a few thousand kilometers,

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:49.168
and then you get the velocity
of that planet around the sun for free.

00:05:49.168 --> 00:05:51.211
We did that a few times.

00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:53.690
We did Earth, we did Mars,
we did twice Earth again,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.658
and we also flew by two asteroids,
Lutetia and Steins.

00:05:58.318 --> 00:06:02.983
Then in 2011, we got so far from the sun
that if the spacecraft got into trouble,

00:06:02.983 --> 00:06:06.792
we couldn't actually
save the spacecraft anymore,

00:06:06.792 --> 00:06:08.765
so we went into hibernation.

00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:12.103
Everything was switched off
except for one clock.

00:06:12.103 --> 00:06:15.614
Here you see in white the trajectory,
and the way this works.

00:06:15.614 --> 00:06:18.057
You see that from
the circle where we started,

00:06:18.057 --> 00:06:21.873
the white line, actually you get
more and more and more elliptical,

00:06:21.873 --> 00:06:24.822
and then finally we approached the comet

00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:29.187
in May 2014, and we had to start
doing the rendezvous maneuvers.

00:06:29.187 --> 00:06:33.784
On the way there, we flew by Earth and we
took a few pictures to test our cameras.

00:06:33.784 --> 00:06:35.962
This is the moon rising over Earth,

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.917
and this is what we now call a selfie,

00:06:37.917 --> 00:06:41.609
which at that time, by the way,
that word didn't exist. (Laughter)

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:44.580
It's at Mars. It was taken
by the CIVA camera.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.762
That's one of the cameras on the lander,

00:06:46.762 --> 00:06:49.177
and it just looks under the solar arrays,

00:06:49.177 --> 00:06:53.450
and you see the planet Mars
and the solar array in the distance.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:59.118
Now, when we got out
of hibernation in January 2014,

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:00.903
we started arriving at a distance

00:07:00.903 --> 00:07:03.736
of two million kilometers
from the comet in May.

00:07:03.736 --> 00:07:07.845
However, the velocity
the spacecraft had was much too fast.

00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:13.906
We were going 2,800 kilometers an hour
faster than the comet, so we had to brake.

00:07:13.906 --> 00:07:15.763
We had to do eight maneuvers,

00:07:15.763 --> 00:07:18.340
and you see here,
some of them were really big.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:24.364
We had to brake the first one
by a few hundred kilometers per hour,

00:07:24.364 --> 00:07:28.674
and actually, the duration of that
was seven hours,

00:07:28.674 --> 00:07:31.622
and it used 218 kilos of fuel,

00:07:31.622 --> 00:07:35.572
and those were seven nerve-wracking 
hours, because in 2007,

00:07:35.572 --> 00:07:38.762
there was a leak in the system
of the propulsion of Rosetta,

00:07:38.762 --> 00:07:40.909
and we had to close off a branch,

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:43.487
so the system was actually
operating at a pressure

00:07:43.487 --> 00:07:46.785
which it was never designed
or qualified for.

00:07:47.795 --> 00:07:52.704
Then we got in the vicinity of the comet,
and these were the first pictures we saw.

00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:55.277
The true comet rotation period
is 12 and a half hours,

00:07:55.277 --> 00:07:57.366
so this is accelerated,

00:07:57.366 --> 00:08:00.617
but you will understand that
our flight dynamics engineers thought,

00:08:00.617 --> 00:08:04.471
this is not going to be
an easy thing to land on.

00:08:04.471 --> 00:08:09.115
We had hoped for some kind
of spud-like thing

00:08:09.115 --> 00:08:11.281
where you could easily land.

00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:14.572
But we had one hope: maybe it was smooth.

00:08:14.572 --> 00:08:18.310
No. That didn't work either. (Laughter)

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.003
So at that point in time,
it was clearly unavoidable:

00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:24.534
we had to map this body
in all the detail you could get,

00:08:24.534 --> 00:08:29.687
because we had to find an area
which is 500 meters in diameter and flat.

00:08:29.687 --> 00:08:34.286
Why 500 meters? That's the error
we have on landing the probe.

00:08:34.286 --> 00:08:37.467
So we went through this process,
and we mapped the comet.

00:08:37.467 --> 00:08:39.834
We used a technique
called photoclinometry.

00:08:39.834 --> 00:08:42.064
You use shadows thrown by the sun.

00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:45.151
What you see here is a rock
sitting on the surface of the comet,

00:08:45.151 --> 00:08:48.077
and the sun shines from above.

00:08:48.077 --> 00:08:50.236
From the shadow, we, with our brain,

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:53.880
can immediately determine
roughly what the shape of that rock is.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.922
You can program that in a computer,

00:08:55.922 --> 00:09:00.176
you then cover the whole comet,
and you can map the comet.

00:09:00.176 --> 00:09:03.856
For that, we flew special trajectories
starting in August.

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:06.765
First, a triangle
of 100 kilometers on a side

00:09:06.765 --> 00:09:08.428
at 100 kilometers' distance,

00:09:08.428 --> 00:09:11.432
and we repeated the whole 
thing at 50 kilometers.

00:09:11.432 --> 00:09:15.079
At that time, we had seen the comet
at all kinds of angles,

00:09:15.079 --> 00:09:19.752
and we could use this technique
to map the whole thing.

00:09:19.752 --> 00:09:23.019
Now, this led to a selection
of landing sites.

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:27.279
This whole process we had to do,
to go from the mapping of the comet

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:30.844
to actually finding
the final landing site, was 60 days.

00:09:30.844 --> 00:09:32.230
We didn't have more.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.350
To give you an idea,
the average Mars mission

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.134
takes hundreds of scientists
for years to meet

00:09:38.134 --> 00:09:40.201
about where shall we go?

00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:42.359
We had 60 days, and that was it.

00:09:42.359 --> 00:09:45.402
We finally selected the final landing site

00:09:45.402 --> 00:09:50.455
and the commands were prepared
for Rosetta to launch Philae.

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:54.830
The way this works is that Rosetta
has to be at the right point in space,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.653
and aiming towards the comet,
because the lander is passive.

00:09:57.653 --> 00:10:01.330
The lander is then pushed out
and moves towards the comet.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.120
Rosetta had to turn around

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.677
to get its cameras to actually look
at Philae while it was departing

00:10:07.677 --> 00:10:10.146
and to be able to communicate with it.

00:10:10.146 --> 00:10:14.720
Now, the landing duration
of the whole trajectory was seven hours.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.507
Now do a simple calculation:

00:10:17.507 --> 00:10:21.546
if the velocity of Rosetta is off
by one centimeter per second,

00:10:21.546 --> 00:10:25.888
seven hours is 25,000 seconds.

00:10:25.888 --> 00:10:30.253
That means 252 meters wrong on the comet.

00:10:30.253 --> 00:10:33.597
So we had to know the velocity of Rosetta

00:10:33.597 --> 00:10:36.104
much better than
one centimeter per second,

00:10:36.104 --> 00:10:40.168
and its location in space
better than 100 meters

00:10:40.168 --> 00:10:43.372
at 500 million kilometers from Earth.

00:10:43.372 --> 00:10:45.740
That's no mean feat.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:50.129
Let me quickly take you through
some of the science and the instruments.

00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:53.565
I won't bore you with all the details
of all the instruments,

00:10:53.565 --> 00:10:55.214
but it's got everything.

00:10:55.214 --> 00:10:58.348
We can sniff gas,
we can measure dust particles,

00:10:58.348 --> 00:11:00.600
the shape of them, the composition,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.108
there are magnetometers, everything.

00:11:03.108 --> 00:11:06.707
This is one of the results from
an instrument which measures gas density

00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:08.565
at the position of Rosetta,

00:11:08.565 --> 00:11:10.794
so it's gas which has left the comet.

00:11:10.794 --> 00:11:13.278
The bottom graph
is September of last year.

00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:16.575
There is a long-term variation,
which in itself is not surprising,

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.456
but you see the sharp peaks.

00:11:18.456 --> 00:11:20.546
This is a comet day.

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:24.656
You can see the effect of the sun
on the evaporation of gas

00:11:24.656 --> 00:11:27.604
and the fact that the comet is rotating.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.312
So there is one spot, apparently,

00:11:29.312 --> 00:11:31.459
where there is a lot of stuff coming from,

00:11:31.459 --> 00:11:34.756
it gets heated in the Sun,
and then cools down on the back side.

00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:38.262
And we can see
the density variations of this.

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:42.395
These are the gases
and the organic compounds

00:11:42.395 --> 00:11:44.090
that we already have measured.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.878
You will see it's an impressive list,

00:11:45.878 --> 00:11:48.362
and there is much, much,
much more to come,

00:11:48.362 --> 00:11:50.308
because there are more measurements.

00:11:50.308 --> 00:11:53.656
Actually, there is a conference
going on in Houston at the moment

00:11:53.656 --> 00:11:56.117
where many of these results are presented.

00:11:56.827 --> 00:11:58.448
Also, we measured dust particles.

00:11:58.448 --> 00:12:01.250
Now, for you, this will not
look very impressive,

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.523
but the scientists were thrilled
when they saw this.

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:05.940
Two dust particles:

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.934
the right one they call Boris,
and they shot it with tantalum

00:12:08.934 --> 00:12:11.048
in order to be able to analyze it.

00:12:11.048 --> 00:12:13.439
Now, we found sodium and magnesium.

00:12:13.439 --> 00:12:17.688
What this tells you is this is
the concentration of these two materials

00:12:17.688 --> 00:12:20.404
at the time the solar system was formed,

00:12:20.404 --> 00:12:23.771
so we learned things about
which materials were there

00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:26.859
when the planet was made.

00:12:26.859 --> 00:12:29.577
Of course, one of the important
elements is the imaging.

00:12:29.577 --> 00:12:32.943
This is one of the cameras of Rosetta,
the OSIRIS camera,

00:12:32.943 --> 00:12:35.938
and this actually was the cover
of Science magazine

00:12:35.938 --> 00:12:38.608
on January 23 of this year.

00:12:38.608 --> 00:12:42.046
Nobody had expected
this body to look like this.

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:45.644
Boulders, rocks -- if anything, it looks
more like the Half Dome in Yosemite

00:12:45.644 --> 00:12:48.151
than anything else.

00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:50.729
We also saw things like this:

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:55.651
dunes, and what look to be,
on the righthand side, wind-blown shadows.

00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:59.575
Now we know these from Mars,
but this comet doesn't have an atmosphere,

00:12:59.575 --> 00:13:02.454
so it's a bit difficult to create
a wind-blown shadow.

00:13:02.454 --> 00:13:04.439
It may be local outgassing,

00:13:04.439 --> 00:13:06.622
stuff which goes up and comes back.

00:13:06.622 --> 00:13:09.803
We don't know, so there is
a lot to investigate.

00:13:09.803 --> 00:13:11.893
Here, you see the same image twice.

00:13:11.893 --> 00:13:14.410
On the left-hand side,
you see in the middle a pit.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.627
On the right-hand side,
if you carefully look,

00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:19.858
there are three jets coming out
of the bottom of that pit.

00:13:19.858 --> 00:13:22.155
So this is the activity of the comet.

00:13:22.155 --> 00:13:26.172
Apparently, at the bottom of these pits
is where the active regions are,

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.935
and where the material
evaporates into space.

00:13:28.935 --> 00:13:32.545
There is a very intriguing crack
in the neck of the comet.

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:34.541
You see it on the right-hand side.

00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:38.237
It's a kilometer long,
and it's two and a half meters wide.

00:13:38.237 --> 00:13:40.483
Some people suggest that actually,

00:13:40.483 --> 00:13:42.551
when we get close to the sun,

00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:44.409
the comet may split in two,

00:13:44.409 --> 00:13:46.089
and then we'll have to choose,

00:13:46.089 --> 00:13:48.341
which comet do we go for?

00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:51.514
The lander -- again, lots of instruments,

00:13:51.514 --> 00:13:56.855
mostly comparable except for the things
which hammer in the ground and drill, etc.

00:13:56.855 --> 00:14:00.732
But much the same as Rosetta, and that is
because you want to compare

00:14:00.732 --> 00:14:04.238
what you find in space
with what you find on the comet.

00:14:04.238 --> 00:14:06.931
These are called
ground truth measurements.

00:14:06.931 --> 00:14:10.162
These are the landing descent images

00:14:10.162 --> 00:14:12.210
that were taken by the OSIRIS camera.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.436
You see the lander getting further
and further away from Rosetta.

00:14:16.436 --> 00:14:20.244
On the top right, you see an image
taken at 60 meters by the lander,

00:14:20.244 --> 00:14:23.100
60 meters above the surface of the comet.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.514
The boulder there is some 10 meters.

00:14:25.514 --> 00:14:30.228
So this is one of the last images we took
before we landed on the comet.

00:14:30.228 --> 00:14:33.786
Here, you see the whole sequence again,
but from a different perspective,

00:14:33.786 --> 00:14:37.971
and you see three blown-ups
from the bottom-left to the middle

00:14:37.971 --> 00:14:42.156
of the lander traveling
over the surface of the comet.

00:14:42.156 --> 00:14:46.342
Then, at the top, there is a before
and an after image of the landing.

00:14:46.342 --> 00:14:50.269
The only problem with the after image is,
there is no lander.

00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:53.540
But if you carefully look
at the right-hand side of this image,

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.569
we saw the lander still there, 
but it had bounced.

00:14:57.569 --> 00:14:59.230
It had departed again.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.317
Now, on a bit of a comical note here

00:15:02.317 --> 00:15:06.937
is that originally Rosetta was designed
to have a lander which would bounce.

00:15:06.937 --> 00:15:09.510
That was discarded because
it was way too expensive.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.784
Now, we forgot, but the lander knew.

00:15:11.784 --> 00:15:13.388
(Laughter)

00:15:13.388 --> 00:15:15.895
During the first bounce,
in the magnetometers,

00:15:15.895 --> 00:15:19.725
you see here the data from them,
from the three axes, x, y and z.

00:15:19.725 --> 00:15:21.931
Halfway through, you see a red line.

00:15:21.931 --> 00:15:23.765
At that red line, there is a change.

00:15:23.765 --> 00:15:27.690
What happened, apparently,
is during the first bounce,

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:32.416
somewhere, we hit the edge of a crater
with one of the legs of the lander,

00:15:32.416 --> 00:15:35.236
and the rotation velocity
of the lander changed.

00:15:35.236 --> 00:15:37.209
So we've been rather lucky

00:15:37.209 --> 00:15:39.485
that we are where we are.

00:15:39.485 --> 00:15:43.154
This is one of
the iconic images of Rosetta.

00:15:43.154 --> 00:15:47.077
It's a man-made object,
a leg of the lander,

00:15:47.077 --> 00:15:49.028
standing on a comet.

00:15:49.028 --> 00:15:54.159
This, for me, is one of the very best
images of space science I have ever seen.

00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:59.340
(Applause)

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.191
One of the things we still have to do
is to actually find the lander.

00:16:03.191 --> 00:16:06.887
The blue area here
is where we know it must be.

00:16:06.887 --> 00:16:10.505
We haven't been able to find it yet,
but the search is continuing,

00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:14.270
as are our efforts to start getting
the lander to work again.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.012
We listen every day,

00:16:16.012 --> 00:16:18.570
and we hope that between now
and somewhere in April,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.308
the lander will wake up again.

00:16:20.308 --> 00:16:22.445
The findings of what
we found on the comet:

00:16:23.795 --> 00:16:26.251
This thing would float in water.

00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:28.875
It's half the density of water.

00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:31.893
So it looks like
a very big rock, but it's not.

00:16:31.893 --> 00:16:35.539
The activity increase we saw
in June, July, August last year

00:16:35.539 --> 00:16:37.930
was a four-fold activity increase.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.673
By the time we will be at the sun,

00:16:39.673 --> 00:16:44.246
there will be 100 kilos
a second leaving this comet:

00:16:44.246 --> 00:16:45.802
gas, dust, whatever.

00:16:45.802 --> 00:16:48.333
That's 100 million kilos a day.

00:16:49.603 --> 00:16:51.978
Then, finally, the landing day.

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:57.366
I will never forget -- absolute madness,
250 TV crews in Germany.

00:16:57.366 --> 00:16:59.385
The BBC was interviewing me,

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:02.357
and another TV crew
who was following me all day

00:17:02.357 --> 00:17:04.493
were filming me being interviewed,

00:17:04.493 --> 00:17:06.931
and it went on like that
for the whole day.

00:17:06.931 --> 00:17:08.742
The Discovery Channel crew

00:17:08.742 --> 00:17:11.064
actually caught me
when leaving the control room,

00:17:11.064 --> 00:17:13.177
and they asked the right question,

00:17:13.177 --> 00:17:16.802
and man, I got into tears,
and I still feel this.

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:18.485
For a month and a half,

00:17:18.485 --> 00:17:21.319
I couldn't think about
landing day without crying,

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:24.034
and I still have the emotion in me.

00:17:24.034 --> 00:17:26.983
With this image of the comet,
I would like to leave you.

00:17:26.983 --> 00:17:29.096
Thank you.

00:17:29.096 --> 00:17:33.975
(Applause)
