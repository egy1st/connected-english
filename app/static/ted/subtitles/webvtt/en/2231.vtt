00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:02.552
I am a Hazara,

00:00:02.552 --> 00:00:07.381
and the homeland
of my people is Afghanistan.

00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:10.400
Like hundreds of thousands
of other Hazara kids,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.164
I was born in exile.

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:17.366
The ongoing persecution
and operation against the Hazaras

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:21.963
forced my parents to leave Afghanistan.

00:00:21.963 --> 00:00:26.374
This persecution has had a long history
going back to the late 1800s,

00:00:26.374 --> 00:00:29.301
and the rule of King Abdur Rahman.

00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:34.897
He killed 63 percent of 
the Hazara population.

00:00:34.897 --> 00:00:37.544
He built minarets with their heads.

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:39.911
Many Hazaras were sold into slavery,

00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:46.204
and many others fled the country
for neighboring Iran and Pakistan.

00:00:46.204 --> 00:00:48.920
My parents also fled to Pakistan,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.916
and settled in Quetta, where I was born.

00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:54.857
After the September 11
attack on the Twin Towers,

00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:56.645
I got a chance to go to Afghanistan

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:59.223
for the first time,
with foreign journalists.

00:00:59.223 --> 00:01:03.030
I was only 18, and I got a job
working as an interpreter.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.213
After four years,

00:01:05.213 --> 00:01:09.903
I felt it was safe enough
to move to Afghanistan permanently,

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:14.523
and I was working there
as a documentary photographer,

00:01:14.523 --> 00:01:18.769
and I worked on many stories.

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:21.373
One of the most important
stories that I did

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:26.087
was the dancing boys of Afghanistan.

00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:30.591
It is a tragic story about
an appalling tradition.

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:34.052
It involves young kids
dancing for warlords

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.141
and powerful men in the society.

00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:39.902
These boys are often abducted
or bought from their poor parents,

00:01:39.902 --> 00:01:42.967
and they are put to work as sex slaves.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:45.731
This is Shukur.

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:49.400
He was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.372
He was taken to another province,

00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:56.133
where he was forced to work as a sex slave
for the warlord and his friends.

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:59.058
When this story was published
in the Washington Post,

00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:01.380
I started receiving death threats,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.118
and I was forced to leave Afghanistan,

00:02:05.118 --> 00:02:07.510
as my parents were.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.202
Along with my family,
I returned back to Quetta.

00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:15.614
The situation in Quetta had changed
dramatically since I left in 2005.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:18.167
Once a peaceful haven for the Hazaras,

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:23.601
it had now turned into the most
dangerous city in Pakistan.

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:27.176
Hazaras are confined into two small areas,

00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:32.029
and they are marginalized socially,
educationally, and financially.

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.469
This is Nadir.

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.466
I had known him since my childhood.

00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:39.645
He was injured when his van
was ambushed by terrorists in Quetta.

00:02:39.645 --> 00:02:43.221
He later died of his injuries.

00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:47.006
Around 1,600 Hazara members

00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:50.629
had been killed in various attacks,

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.527
and around 3,000 of them were injured,

00:02:55.527 --> 00:02:58.778
and many of them permanently disabled.

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:02.076
The attacks on the Hazara community
would only get worse,

00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:04.908
so it was not surprising
that many wanted to flee.

00:03:04.908 --> 00:03:09.668
After Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan,

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:16.332
Australia is home to the fourth largest
population of Hazaras in the world.

00:03:16.332 --> 00:03:19.141
When it came time to leave Pakistan,

00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:21.091
Australia seemed the obvious choice.

00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:23.088
Financially, only one of us could leave,

00:03:23.088 --> 00:03:24.946
and it was decided that I would go,

00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:28.299
in the hope that if I arrived
at my destination safely,

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.291
I could work to get the rest
of my family to join me later.

00:03:33.291 --> 00:03:34.870
We all knew about the risks,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.842
and how terrifying the journey is,

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:42.416
and I met many people
who lost loved ones at sea.

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:46.805
It was a desperate decision to take,
to leave everything behind,

00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:49.680
and no one makes this decision easily.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.866
If I had been able
to simply fly to Australia,

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:54.490
it would have taken me
less than 24 hours.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.576
But getting a visa was impossible.

00:03:58.576 --> 00:04:00.689
My journey was much longer,

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.943
much more complicated,

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:05.989
and certainly more dangerous,

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.631
traveling to Thailand by air,

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:13.429
and then by road and boat
to Malaysia and into Indonesia,

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:15.844
paying people and smugglers all the way

00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:18.584
and spending a lot of time hiding

00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:22.300
and a lot of time in fear of being caught.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.687
In Indonesia, I joined a group
of seven asylum seekers.

00:04:26.687 --> 00:04:29.241
We all shared a bedroom

00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:33.119
in a town outside of Jakarta called Bogor.

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:35.419
After spending a week in Bogor,

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.868
three of my roommates
left for the perilous journey,

00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:42.700
and we got the news two days later

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.506
that a distressed boat sank
in the sea en route to Christmas Island.

00:04:47.506 --> 00:04:51.267
We found out that our three roommates --
Nawroz, Jaffar and Shabbir --

00:04:51.267 --> 00:04:53.218
were also among those.

00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:55.656
Only Jaffar was rescued.

00:04:55.656 --> 00:04:59.249
Shabbir and Nawroz were never seen again.

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:00.898
It made me think,

00:05:00.898 --> 00:05:03.568
am I doing the right thing?

00:05:03.568 --> 00:05:07.515
I concluded I really had
no other choice but to go on.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:11.370
A few weeks later, we got the call
from the people smuggler

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.060
to alert us that the boat is ready for us
to commence our sea journey.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.940
Taken in the night towards the main vessel

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.588
on a motorboat,

00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:25.603
we boarded an old fishing boat
that was already overloaded.

00:05:25.603 --> 00:05:27.693
There were 93 of us,

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:29.666
and we were all below deck.

00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:31.919
No one was allowed up on the top.

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.077
We all paid 6,000 dollars each

00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:37.166
for this part of the trip.

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:39.395
The first night and day went smoothly,

00:05:39.395 --> 00:05:42.623
but by the second night, 
the weather turned.

00:05:42.623 --> 00:05:47.568
Waves tossed the boat around,
and the timbers groaned.

00:05:47.568 --> 00:05:51.910
People below deck were crying,
praying, recalling their loved ones.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.652
They were screaming.

00:05:53.652 --> 00:05:55.811
It was a terrible moment.

00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:59.758
It was like a scene from doomsday,

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:04.583
or maybe like one of those scenes
from those Hollywood movies

00:06:04.583 --> 00:06:07.788
that shows that everything
is breaking apart

00:06:07.788 --> 00:06:10.225
and the world is just ending.

00:06:10.225 --> 00:06:12.849
It was happening to us for real.

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.192
We didn't have any hope.

00:06:17.192 --> 00:06:20.720
Our boat was floating
like a matchbox on the water

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.856
without any control.

00:06:22.856 --> 00:06:26.618
The waves were much higher than our boat,

00:06:26.618 --> 00:06:32.655
and the water poured in faster
than the motor pumps could take it out.

00:06:32.655 --> 00:06:35.511
We all lost hope.

00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:37.950
We thought, this is the end.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.876
We were watching our deaths,

00:06:39.876 --> 00:06:42.268
and I was documenting it.

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:44.219
The captain told us

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:46.586
that we are not going to make it,

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:49.767
we have to turn back the boat.

00:06:49.767 --> 00:06:51.834
We went on the deck

00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:54.366
and turned our torches on and off

00:06:54.366 --> 00:06:59.265
to attract the attention
of any passing boat.

00:06:59.265 --> 00:07:06.649
We kept trying to attract their attention
by waving our life jackets and whistling.

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:10.084
Eventually, we made it to a small island.

00:07:10.084 --> 00:07:13.335
Our boat crashing onto the rocks,

00:07:13.335 --> 00:07:15.378
I slipped into the water

00:07:15.378 --> 00:07:19.025
and destroyed my camera,
whatever I had documented.

00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:24.791
But luckily, the memory card survived.

00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:27.206
It was a thick forest.

00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:32.965
We all split up into many groups
as we argued over what to do next.

00:07:32.965 --> 00:07:35.333
We were all scared and confused.

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:38.630
Then, after spending
the night on the beach,

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.253
we found a jetty and coconuts.

00:07:41.253 --> 00:07:44.249
We hailed a boat from a nearby resort,

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:48.498
and then were quickly handed over
to Indonesian water police.

00:07:48.498 --> 00:07:52.100
At Serang Detention Center,

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.158
an immigration officer came
and furtively strip-searched us.

00:07:57.158 --> 00:08:00.526
He took our mobile, my $300 cash,

00:08:00.526 --> 00:08:03.938
our shoes that we should not
be able to escape,

00:08:03.938 --> 00:08:09.999
but we kept watching the guards,
checking their movements,

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:13.842
and around 4 a.m.
when they sat around a fire,

00:08:13.842 --> 00:08:17.396
we removed two glass layers
from an outside facing window

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:18.915
and slipped through.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:23.744
We climbed a tree next to an outer wall
that was topped with the shards of glass.

00:08:23.744 --> 00:08:26.043
We put the pillow on that

00:08:26.043 --> 00:08:29.573
and wrapped our forearms with bedsheets

00:08:29.573 --> 00:08:31.671
and climbed the wall,

00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:35.418
and we ran away with bare feet.

00:08:35.418 --> 00:08:37.207
I was free,

00:08:37.207 --> 00:08:39.924
with an uncertain future,

00:08:39.924 --> 00:08:41.734
no money.

00:08:41.734 --> 00:08:48.858
The only thing I had was the memory card
with the pictures and footage.

00:08:48.858 --> 00:08:52.275
When my documentary was aired
on SBS Dateline,

00:08:52.275 --> 00:08:54.854
many of my friends came to know
about my situation,

00:08:54.854 --> 00:08:56.710
and they tried to help me.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.448
They did not allow me to take
any other boat to risk my life.

00:09:00.448 --> 00:09:04.953
I also decided to stay in Indonesia
and process my case through UNHCR,

00:09:04.953 --> 00:09:08.807
but I was really afraid
that I would end up in Indonesia

00:09:08.807 --> 00:09:12.461
for many years doing nothing
and unable to work,

00:09:12.461 --> 00:09:15.706
like every other asylum seeker.

00:09:15.706 --> 00:09:18.930
But it had happened to be
a little bit different with me.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.923
I was lucky.

00:09:23.923 --> 00:09:28.381
My contacts worked to expedite
my case through UNHCR,

00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:33.119
and I got resettled
in Australia in May 2013.

00:09:33.119 --> 00:09:37.298
Not every asylum seeker is lucky like me.

00:09:37.298 --> 00:09:44.588
It is really difficult to live a life
with an uncertain fate, in limbo.

00:09:44.588 --> 00:09:48.419
The issue of asylum seekers in Australia

00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:51.137
has been so extremely politicized

00:09:51.137 --> 00:09:54.271
that it has lost its human face.

00:09:54.271 --> 00:10:00.372
The asylum seekers have been demonized
and then presented to the people.

00:10:00.372 --> 00:10:04.907
I hope my story and the story
of other Hazaras

00:10:04.907 --> 00:10:07.960
could shed some light to show the people

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.261
how these people are suffering
in their countries of origin,

00:10:12.261 --> 00:10:16.180
and how they suffer,

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.916
why they risk their lives to seek asylum.

00:10:20.916 --> 00:10:22.426
Thank you.

00:10:22.426 --> 00:10:23.665
(Applause)
