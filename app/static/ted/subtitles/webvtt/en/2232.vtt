00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:09.740
This is a kindergarten
we designed in 2007.

00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:14.036
We made this kindergarten 
to be a circle.

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:17.178
It's a kind of endless circulation
on top of the roof.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.699
If you are a parent,

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.663
you know that kids love
to keep making circles.

00:00:24.793 --> 00:00:27.600
This is how the rooftop looks.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.858
And why did we design this?

00:00:29.858 --> 00:00:32.675
The principal of this kindergarten said,

00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:35.254
"No, I don't want a handrail."

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:37.483
I said, "It's impossible."

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:43.777
But he insisted: "How about having a net
sticking out from the edge of the roof?

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.986
So that it can catch
the children falling off?"

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:47.433
(Laughter)

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.509
I said, "It's impossible."

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.889
And of course,
the government official said,

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:56.154
"Of course you have to have a handrail."

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.843
But we could keep 
that idea around the trees.

00:01:01.843 --> 00:01:05.120
There are three trees popping through.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.745
And we were allowed to call 
this rope as a handrail.

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:14.017
But of course, rope has nothing
to do with them.

00:01:14.017 --> 00:01:16.503
They fall into the net.

00:01:17.304 --> 00:01:20.355
And you get more,

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:23.292
and more,

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:24.502
more.

00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:25.653
(Laughter)

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:29.203
Sometimes 40 children 
are around a tree.

00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:32.981
The boy on the branch,

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:35.464
he loves the tree
so he is eating the tree.

00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:37.964
(Laughter)

00:01:38.984 --> 00:01:40.785
And at the time of an event,

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:43.051
they sit on the edge.

00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:46.563
It looks so nice from underneath.

00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:48.652
Monkeys in the zoo.

00:01:48.652 --> 00:01:52.552
(Laughter)

00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:54.318
Feeding time.

00:01:54.318 --> 00:01:58.949
(Laughter) 
(Applause)

00:02:00.784 --> 00:02:03.313
And we made the roof as low as possible,

00:02:03.313 --> 00:02:07.757
because we wanted to see
children on top of the roof,

00:02:07.757 --> 00:02:10.438
not only underneath the roof.

00:02:10.438 --> 00:02:14.299
And if the roof is too high,
you see only the ceiling.

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:20.215
And the leg washing place --
there are many kinds of water taps.

00:02:20.656 --> 00:02:22.434
You see with the flexible tubes,

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:25.329
you want to spray water
to your friends,

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.044
and the shower,

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:29.541
and the one in front is quite normal.

00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:31.087
But if you look at this,

00:02:31.087 --> 00:02:32.917
the boy is not washing his boots,

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:34.591
he's putting water into his boots.

00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:36.531
(Laughter)

00:02:41.423 --> 00:02:46.499
This kindergarten is completely
open, most of the year.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:51.339
And there is no boundary
between inside and outside.

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:55.978
So it means basically
this architecture is a roof.

00:02:55.978 --> 00:02:59.267
And also there is no boundary
between classrooms.

00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:02.861
So there is no acoustic barrier at all.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.415
When you put many children in a quiet box,

00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:12.733
some of them get really nervous.

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:14.985
But in this kindergarten,

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:18.415
there is no reason they get nervous.

00:03:18.415 --> 00:03:21.225
Because there is no boundary.

00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:23.422
And the principal says

00:03:23.422 --> 00:03:27.425
if the boy in the corner
doesn't want to stay in the room,

00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:29.120
we let him go.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.279
He will come back eventually,
because it's a circle, it comes back.

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.241
(Laughter)

00:03:36.561 --> 00:03:39.556
But the point is,
in that kind of occasion,

00:03:39.556 --> 00:03:42.407
usually children try to hide somewhere.

00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:46.986
But here, just they leave and come back.

00:03:46.986 --> 00:03:48.836
It's a natural process.

00:03:48.836 --> 00:03:53.859
And secondly, we consider
noise very important.

00:03:55.711 --> 00:04:02.142
You know that children
sleep better in noise.

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:05.986
They don't sleep in a quiet space.

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:08.236
And in this kindergarten,

00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:13.483
these children show
amazing concentration in class.

00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:21.660
And you know, our kind grew up
in the jungle with noise.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.663
They need noise.

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:27.967
And you know, you can talk
to your friends in a noisy bar.

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:31.928
You are not supposed to be in silence.

00:04:31.928 --> 00:04:34.095
And you know, these days

00:04:34.095 --> 00:04:38.569
we are trying to make
everything under control.

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.021
You know, it's completely open.

00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:45.033
And you should know that

00:04:45.033 --> 00:04:50.818
we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter.

00:04:50.818 --> 00:04:53.922
In summer you go swimming.

00:04:53.922 --> 00:04:55.766
The sand is 50 degrees.

00:04:56.636 --> 00:05:00.029
And also, you should know
that you are waterproof.

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:03.181
You never melt in rain.

00:05:03.181 --> 00:05:07.050
So, children are supposed to be outside.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.251
So that is how we should treat them.

00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:12.923
This is how they divide classrooms.

00:05:12.923 --> 00:05:15.426
They are supposed to help teachers.

00:05:15.426 --> 00:05:17.731
They don't.

00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:19.346
(Laughter)

00:05:23.226 --> 00:05:25.382
I didn't put him in.

00:05:27.522 --> 00:05:29.706
A classroom.

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:32.105
And a washbasin.

00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:35.932
They talk to each other around the well.

00:05:37.082 --> 00:05:40.819
And there are always 
some trees in the classroom.

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.377
A monkey trying to fish
another monkey from above.

00:05:47.377 --> 00:05:49.225
(Laughter)

00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:50.829
Monkeys.

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:52.283
(Laughter)

00:05:52.283 --> 00:05:56.698
And each classroom has
at least one skylight.

00:05:57.468 --> 00:06:01.465
And this is where Santa Claus
comes down at the time of Christmas.

00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:09.682
This is the annex building,

00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:14.151
right next to that
oval-shaped kindergarten.

00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:19.810
The building is only
five meters tall with seven floors.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.971
And of course,
the ceiling height is very low.

00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:26.036
So you have to consider safety.

00:06:26.036 --> 00:06:30.417
So, we put our children,
a daughter and a son.

00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:34.241
They tried to go in.

00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:38.353
He hit his head.

00:06:39.343 --> 00:06:43.312
He's okay. His skull is quite strong.

00:06:43.312 --> 00:06:46.400
He is resilient. It's my son.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.068
(Laughter)

00:06:49.038 --> 00:06:51.898
And he is trying to see
if it is safe to jump off.

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:55.705
And then we put other children.

00:07:00.835 --> 00:07:03.376
The traffic jam is awful
in Tokyo, as you know.

00:07:03.376 --> 00:07:04.528
(Laughter)

00:07:04.528 --> 00:07:09.379
The driver in front,
she needs to learn how to drive.

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:11.910
Now these days,

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.530
kids need a small dosage of danger.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.375
And in this kind of occasion,

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:25.300
they learn to help each other.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.735
This is society. This is the kind of
opportunity we are losing these days.

00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:42.976
Now, this drawing is showing
the movement of a boy

00:07:42.976 --> 00:07:49.300
between 9:10 and 9:30.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:55.501
And the circumference
of this building is 183 meters.

00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:59.353
So it's not exactly small at all.

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:03.959
And this boy did 6,000 meters
in the morning.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:07.551
But the surprise is yet to come.

00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:14.248
The children in this kindergarten
do 4,000 meters on average.

00:08:15.455 --> 00:08:22.435
And these children have
the highest athletic abilities

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:25.590
among many kindergartens.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.016
The principal says,

00:08:33.016 --> 00:08:38.743
"I don't train them.
We leave them on top of the roof.

00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:40.972
Just like sheep."

00:08:40.972 --> 00:08:42.401
(Laughter)

00:08:42.401 --> 00:08:44.230
They keep running.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.259
(Laughter)

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:51.838
My point is don't control them,

00:08:51.838 --> 00:08:55.060
don't protect them too much,

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.687
and they need to tumble sometimes.

00:08:58.687 --> 00:09:02.473
They need to get some injury.

00:09:02.473 --> 00:09:05.892
And that makes them learn

00:09:05.892 --> 00:09:09.028
how to live in this world.

00:09:11.848 --> 00:09:19.057
I think architecture is capable
of changing this world,

00:09:19.057 --> 00:09:20.899
and people's lives.

00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:27.991
And this is one of the attempts
to change the lives of children.

00:09:28.481 --> 00:09:30.133
Thank you very much.

00:09:30.158 --> 00:09:32.152
(Applause)
