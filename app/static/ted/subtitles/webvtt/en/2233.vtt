00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:06.451
Today, I am going to talk about anger.


00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:11.130
When I was 11,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.462
seeing some of my friends 
leaving the school

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:18.684
because their parents 
could not afford textbooks

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:21.186
made me angry.

00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:26.068
When I was 27,

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:31.280
hearing the plight
of a desperate slave father

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.292
whose daughter was 
about to be sold to a brothel

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.683
made me angry.

00:00:40.423 --> 00:00:42.763
At the age of 50,

00:00:42.763 --> 00:00:47.586
lying on the street,
in a pool of blood,

00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:50.532
along with my own son,

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:52.999
made me angry.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.484
Dear friends, for centuries
we were taught anger is bad.

00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:03.486
Our parents, teachers, priests --

00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:09.371
everyone taught us how to control 
and suppress our anger.

00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:14.146
But I ask why?

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:20.513
Why can't we convert our anger
for the larger good of society?

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.109
Why can't we use our anger

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.615
to challenge and change
the evils of the world?

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:32.176
That I tried to do.

00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:35.847
Friends,

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:43.370
most of the brightest ideas
came to my mind out of anger.

00:01:43.814 --> 00:01:53.514
Like when I was 35 and sat 
in a locked-up, tiny prison.

00:01:54.564 --> 00:01:57.067
The whole night, I was angry.

00:01:57.957 --> 00:02:01.017
But it has given birth to a new idea.

00:02:01.017 --> 00:02:04.176
But I will come to that later on.

00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:11.041
Let me begin with the story
of how I got a name for myself.

00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:17.622
I had been a big admirer 
of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood.

00:02:19.032 --> 00:02:24.321
Gandhi fought and lead 
India's freedom movement.

00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:27.299
But more importantly,

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:34.034
he taught us how to treat 
the most vulnerable sections,

00:02:34.034 --> 00:02:38.305
the most deprived people, 
with dignity and respect.

00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:44.562
And so, when India was celebrating

00:02:44.562 --> 00:02:47.829
Mahatma Gandhi's 
birth centenary in 1969 --

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.117
at that time I was 15 --

00:02:50.117 --> 00:02:52.474
an idea came to my mind.

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:57.244
Why can't we celebrate it differently?

00:02:57.244 --> 00:03:02.672
I knew, as perhaps
many of you might know,

00:03:02.672 --> 00:03:10.665
that in India, a large number of people
are born in the lowest segment of caste.

00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:15.324
And they are treated as untouchables.

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.656
These are the people --

00:03:16.656 --> 00:03:21.066
forget about allowing them 
to go to the temples,

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:28.250
they cannot even go into the houses 
and shops of high-caste people.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.564
So I was very impressed with 
the leaders of my town

00:03:33.564 --> 00:03:38.102
who were speaking very highly against
the caste system and untouchability

00:03:38.102 --> 00:03:40.274
and talking of Gandhian ideals.

00:03:41.774 --> 00:03:44.944
So inspired by that, I thought,
let us set an example

00:03:44.944 --> 00:03:51.389
by inviting these people to eat food
cooked and served

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.619
by the untouchable community.

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:59.551
I went to some low-caste,
so-called untouchable, people,

00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:05.807
tried to convince them,
but it was unthinkable for them.

00:04:05.807 --> 00:04:09.760
They told me, "No, no. It's not possible.
It never happened."

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.784
I said, "Look at these leaders,

00:04:12.784 --> 00:04:15.221
they are so great, 
they are against untouchability.

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:17.911
They will come. If nobody comes, 
we can set an example."

00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:26.751
These people thought that I was too naive.

00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:30.651
Finally, they were convinced.

00:04:30.651 --> 00:04:36.352
My friends and I took our bicycles
and invited political leaders.

00:04:37.982 --> 00:04:41.126
And I was so thrilled, rather, empowered

00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:45.722
to see that each one of them 
agreed to come.

00:04:47.192 --> 00:04:50.083
I thought, "Great idea.
We can set an example.

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:53.711
We can bring about change in the society."

00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:57.004
The day has come.

00:04:57.724 --> 00:05:03.467
All these untouchables,
three women and two men,

00:05:03.467 --> 00:05:06.816
they agreed to come.

00:05:07.436 --> 00:05:13.075
I could recall that they had used 
the best of their clothes.

00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:16.740
They brought new utensils.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.339
They had taken baths 
hundreds of times

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.300
because it was unthinkable
for them to do.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.944
It was the moment of change.

00:05:27.254 --> 00:05:29.702
They gathered. Food was cooked.

00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:33.000
It was 7 o'clock.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.876
By 8 o'clock, we kept on waiting,

00:05:35.876 --> 00:05:40.857
because it's not very uncommon 
that the leaders become late,

00:05:40.857 --> 00:05:42.539
for an hour or so.

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:49.922
So after 8 o'clock, we took our bicycles
and went to these leaders' homes,

00:05:49.922 --> 00:05:52.278
just to remind them.

00:05:54.248 --> 00:05:58.945
One of the leader's wives told me,

00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:03.960
"Sorry, he is having some headache,
perhaps he cannot come."

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.037
I went to another leader

00:06:06.037 --> 00:06:10.097
and his wife told me, 
"Okay, you go, he will definitely join."

00:06:11.357 --> 00:06:15.469
So I thought that the dinner
will take place,

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.952
though not at that large a scale.

00:06:21.352 --> 00:06:27.319
I went back to the venue, which was
a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park.

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:30.053
It was 10 o'clock.

00:06:31.483 --> 00:06:34.822
None of the leaders showed up.

00:06:36.132 --> 00:06:38.835
That made me angry.

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:46.679
I was standing, leaning against
Mahatma Gandhi's statue.

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:54.310
I was emotionally drained,
rather exhausted.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:02.375
Then I sat down where 
the food was lying.

00:07:05.695 --> 00:07:07.785
I kept my emotions on hold.

00:07:07.785 --> 00:07:12.279
But then, when I took the first bite,

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:15.210
I broke down in tears.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.149
And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:26.047
And it was the healing, motherly touch 
of an untouchable woman.

00:07:26.047 --> 00:07:30.278
And she told me,
"Kailash, why are you crying?

00:07:31.598 --> 00:07:34.011
You have done your bit.

00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:37.136
You have eaten the food
cooked by untouchables,

00:07:37.136 --> 00:07:40.127
which has never happened in our memory."

00:07:41.207 --> 00:07:45.789
She said, "You won today."

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:50.759
And my friends, she was right.

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:55.789
I came back home, a little after midnight,

00:07:55.789 --> 00:08:00.363
shocked to see that several 
high-caste elderly people

00:08:00.363 --> 00:08:02.517
were sitting in my courtyard.

00:08:02.517 --> 00:08:05.613
I saw my mother and 
elderly women were crying

00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:10.071
and they were pleading 
to these elderly people

00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:13.005
because they had threatened 
to outcaste my whole family.

00:08:14.345 --> 00:08:19.477
And you know, outcasting the family
is the biggest social punishment

00:08:19.477 --> 00:08:22.031
one can think of.

00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:28.821
Somehow they agreed to punish only me,
and the punishment was purification.

00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:33.336
That means I had to go 600 miles
away from my hometown

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:37.267
to the River Ganges to take a holy dip.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:41.691
And after that, I should organize a feast
for priests, 101 priests,

00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:45.239
wash their feet and drink that water.

00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:49.528
It was total nonsense,

00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:52.417
and I refused to accept that punishment.

00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:55.397
How did they punish me?

00:08:55.397 --> 00:09:01.194
I was barred from entering into my own 
kitchen and my own dining room,

00:09:01.194 --> 00:09:04.246
my utensils were separated.

00:09:04.246 --> 00:09:09.300
But the night when I was angry,
they wanted to outcaste me.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.633
But I decided to outcaste 
the entire caste system.

00:09:15.503 --> 00:09:20.228
(Applause)

00:09:20.988 --> 00:09:26.003
And that was possible because
the beginning would have been

00:09:26.003 --> 00:09:28.119
to change the family name, or surname,

00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:31.784
because in India, most of
the family names are caste names.

00:09:31.784 --> 00:09:34.306
So I decided to drop my name.

00:09:34.306 --> 00:09:40.810
And then, later on, I gave 
a new name to myself: Satyarthi,

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.776
that means, "seeker of truth."

00:09:45.216 --> 00:09:49.248
(Applause)

00:09:49.248 --> 00:09:52.585
And that was the beginning 
of my transformative anger.

00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:56.704
Friends, maybe one of you can tell me,

00:09:56.704 --> 00:10:01.530
what was I doing before becoming
a children's rights activist?

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.788
Does anybody know?

00:10:04.898 --> 00:10:06.169
No.

00:10:06.169 --> 00:10:12.558
I was an engineer, an electrical engineer.

00:10:12.558 --> 00:10:17.662
And then I learned how the energy

00:10:17.662 --> 00:10:22.146
of burning fire, coal,

00:10:22.146 --> 00:10:26.250
the nuclear blast inside the chambers,

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.442
raging river currents,

00:10:29.442 --> 00:10:33.066
fierce winds,

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:38.083
could be converted into the light 
and lives of millions.

00:10:38.963 --> 00:10:43.495
I also learned how the most
uncontrollable form of energy

00:10:43.495 --> 00:10:47.970
could be harnessed for good 
and making society better.

00:10:52.925 --> 00:10:59.692
So I'll come back to the story
of when I was caught in the prison:

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:03.919
I was very happy freeing 
a dozen children from slavery,

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:06.890
handing them over to their parents.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.078
I cannot explain my joy 
when I free a child.

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:12.428
I was so happy.

00:11:13.458 --> 00:11:19.021
But when I was waiting for my train
to come back to my hometown, Delhi,

00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:22.264
I saw that dozens of children 
were arriving;

00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:25.562
they were being trafficked by someone.

00:11:25.562 --> 00:11:28.415
I stopped them, those people.

00:11:28.415 --> 00:11:30.517
I complained to the police.

00:11:30.517 --> 00:11:35.071
So the policemen, instead of helping me,

00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:40.773
they threw me in this small, 
tiny shell, like an animal.

00:11:41.573 --> 00:11:43.121
And that was the night of anger

00:11:43.121 --> 00:11:46.972
when one of the brightest 
and biggest ideas was born.

00:11:47.632 --> 00:11:53.100
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 
children, and 50 more will join,

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.560
that's not done.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.368
And I believed in the power of consumers,

00:11:57.368 --> 00:12:00.852
and let me tell you that this
was the first time

00:12:00.852 --> 00:12:05.968
when a campaign was launched by me
or anywhere in the world,

00:12:05.968 --> 00:12:10.041
to educate and sensitize the consumers


00:12:10.041 --> 00:12:14.501
to create a demand
for child-labor-free rugs.

00:12:15.691 --> 00:12:19.083
In Europe and America, 
we have been successful.

00:12:19.083 --> 00:12:23.768
And it has resulted 
in a fall in child labor

00:12:23.768 --> 00:12:27.024
in South Asian countries by 80 percent.

00:12:27.024 --> 00:12:30.406
(Applause)

00:12:32.736 --> 00:12:39.397
Not only that, but this first-ever 
consumer's power, or consumer's campaign

00:12:39.397 --> 00:12:43.505
has grown in other countries
and other industries,

00:12:43.505 --> 00:12:48.931
maybe chocolate, maybe apparel, 
maybe shoes -- it has gone beyond.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.823
My anger at the age of 11,

00:12:52.823 --> 00:12:58.176
when I realized how important
education is for every child,

00:12:58.176 --> 00:13:05.821
I got an idea to collect used books
and help the poorest children.

00:13:05.821 --> 00:13:09.270
I created a book bank at the age of 11.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.813
But I did not stop.

00:13:11.813 --> 00:13:14.046
Later on, I cofounded

00:13:14.046 --> 00:13:18.580
the world's single largest civil society
campaign for education

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.571
that is the Global Campaign for Education.

00:13:22.221 --> 00:13:26.866
That has helped in changing 
the whole thinking towards education

00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:29.257
from the charity mode
to the human rights mode,

00:13:29.257 --> 00:13:34.026
and that has concretely helped 
the reduction of out-of-school children

00:13:34.026 --> 00:13:37.614
by half in the last 15 years.

00:13:37.614 --> 00:13:41.693
(Applause)

00:13:43.753 --> 00:13:46.867
My anger at the age of 27,

00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:52.235
to free that girl who was about
to be sold to a brothel,

00:13:52.235 --> 00:13:57.018
has given me an idea

00:13:57.018 --> 00:14:01.271
to go for a new strategy
of raid and rescue,

00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:04.188
freeing children from slavery.

00:14:04.758 --> 00:14:10.614
And I am so lucky and proud to say
that it is not one or 10 or 20,

00:14:10.614 --> 00:14:16.957
but my colleagues and I have been able
to physically liberate 83,000 child slaves

00:14:16.962 --> 00:14:20.093
and hand them over
back to their families and mothers.

00:14:20.093 --> 00:14:23.452
(Applause)

00:14:25.692 --> 00:14:27.979
I knew that we needed global policies.

00:14:27.979 --> 00:14:31.011
We organized the worldwide marches
against child labor

00:14:31.011 --> 00:14:37.073
and that has also resulted in 
a new international convention

00:14:37.073 --> 00:14:41.172
to protect the children
who are in the worst forms.

00:14:42.262 --> 00:14:46.351
And the concrete result was that
the number of child laborers globally

00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:51.891
has gone down by one third 
in the last 15 years.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:56.311
(Applause)

00:14:56.311 --> 00:14:59.721
So, in each case,

00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:03.510
it began from anger,

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.159
turned into an idea,

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:09.565
and action.

00:15:09.565 --> 00:15:12.441
So anger, what next?

00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:14.920
Idea, and --

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.278
Audience: Action

00:15:16.278 --> 00:15:20.835
Kailash Satyarthi: Anger, idea, action.
Which I tried to do.

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:24.751
Anger is a power, anger is an energy,

00:15:24.751 --> 00:15:27.552
and the law of nature is that energy

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:32.795
can never be created and never 
be vanished, can never be destroyed.

00:15:32.795 --> 00:15:39.685
So why can't the energy of anger
be translated and harnessed

00:15:39.685 --> 00:15:44.221
to create a better and beautiful world,
a more just and equitable world?

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:47.341
Anger is within each one of you,

00:15:47.341 --> 00:15:53.241
and I will share a secret
for a few seconds:

00:15:53.241 --> 00:16:00.795
that if we are confined in 
the narrow shells of egos,

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:05.225
and the circles of selfishness,

00:16:05.225 --> 00:16:12.709
then the anger will turn out to be
hatred, violence, revenge, destruction.

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:16.595
But if we are able to break the circles,

00:16:16.595 --> 00:16:22.481
then the same anger could turn 
into a great power.

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:26.828
We can break the circles 
by using our inherent compassion

00:16:26.828 --> 00:16:30.678
and connect with the world through 
compassion to make this world better.

00:16:30.678 --> 00:16:34.351
That same anger could be
transformed into it.

00:16:34.351 --> 00:16:38.936
So dear friends, sisters and brothers,
again, as a Nobel Laureate,

00:16:39.956 --> 00:16:42.711
I am urging you to become angry.

00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:46.983
I am urging you to become angry.

00:16:48.003 --> 00:16:52.299
And the angriest among us

00:16:52.299 --> 00:16:59.510
is the one who can transform his anger 
into idea and action.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.275
Thank you so much.

00:17:02.275 --> 00:17:06.245
(Applause)

00:17:15.115 --> 00:17:18.924
Chris Anderson: For many years, 
you've been an inspiration to others.

00:17:18.924 --> 00:17:22.109
Who or what inspires you and why?

00:17:22.629 --> 00:17:24.341
KS: Good question.

00:17:24.341 --> 00:17:28.335
Chris, let me tell you, 
and that is the truth,

00:17:28.335 --> 00:17:32.849
each time when I free a child,

00:17:32.849 --> 00:17:37.028
the child who has lost all his hope
that he will ever come back to his mother,

00:17:37.028 --> 00:17:41.335
the first smile of freedom,

00:17:41.335 --> 00:17:43.890
and the mother who has lost all hope

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:50.501
that the son or daughter 
can ever come back and sit in her lap,

00:17:50.501 --> 00:17:52.656
they become so emotional

00:17:52.656 --> 00:17:57.809
and the first tear of joy 
rolls down on her cheek,

00:17:57.809 --> 00:18:01.154
I see the glimpse of God in it --
this is my biggest inspiration.

00:18:01.154 --> 00:18:06.032
And I am so lucky that not once,
as I said before, but thousands of times,

00:18:06.032 --> 00:18:09.628
I have been able to witness my God
in the faces of those children

00:18:09.628 --> 00:18:11.640
and they are my biggest inspirations.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.652
Thank you.

00:18:13.652 --> 00:18:15.665
(Applause)
