00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.779
This is a story about capitalism.

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.567
It's a system I love

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:11.291
because of the successes and opportunities
it's afforded me and millions of others.

00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:18.056
I started in my 20s trading commodities,
cotton in particular, in the pits,

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:21.682
and if there was ever a free market
free-for-all, this was it,

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:25.300
where men wearing ties 
but acting like gladiators

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.787
fought literally 
and physically for a profit.

00:00:29.437 --> 00:00:32.360
Fortunately, I was good enough
that by the time I was 30,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.020
I was able to move into the upstairs 
world of money management,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.572
where I spent the next three decades
as a global macro trader.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.846
And over that time, I've seen
a lot of crazy things in the markets,

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:47.529
and I've traded a lot of crazy manias.

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:49.638
And unfortunately,

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:52.938
I'm sad to report that right now 
we might be in the grips

00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:56.894
of one of the most disastrous,
certainly of my career,

00:00:56.894 --> 00:01:00.115
and one consistent takeaway is
manias never end well.

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:03.581
Now, over the past 50 years,

00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:09.432
we as a society have come to view
our companies and corporations

00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:14.238
in a very narrow, almost
monomaniacal fashion

00:01:14.988 --> 00:01:18.255
with regard to how we value them,

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:21.924
and we have put
so much emphasis on profits,

00:01:21.924 --> 00:01:24.710
on short-term quarterly
earnings and share prices,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.550
at the exclusion of all else.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.319
It's like we've ripped the humanity
out of our companies.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.313
Now, we don't do that --
conveniently reduce something

00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:39.521
to a set of numbers that you
can play with like Lego toys --

00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:41.869
we don't do that in our individual life.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.072
We don't treat somebody or value them

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:49.213
based on their monthly income 
or their credit score,

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:51.020
but we have this double standard

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.565
when it comes to the way
that we value our businesses,

00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:55.050
and you know what?

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.215
It's threatening the very
underpinnings of our society.

00:01:58.215 --> 00:01:59.817
And here's how you'll see.

00:01:59.817 --> 00:02:04.322
This chart is corporate profit margins
going back 40 years

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:06.400
as a percentage of revenues,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.707
and you can see that we're
at a 40-year high of 12.5 percent.

00:02:10.707 --> 00:02:14.259
Now, hooray if you're a shareholder,


00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:18.526
but if you're the other side of that,
and you're the average American worker,

00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:21.833
then you can see it's not
such a good thing.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:25.410
["U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs.
CEO-to-Worker Compensation Ratio"]

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.527
Now, higher profit margins
do not increase societal wealth.

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:33.766
What they actually do is they
exacerbate income inequality,

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:36.166
and that's not a good thing.

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:38.627
But intuitively, that makes sense, right?

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:42.250
Because if the top 10 percent
of American families

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.610
own 90 percent of the stocks,

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.571
as they take a greater share
of corporate profits,

00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:51.514
then there's less wealth left
for the rest of society.

00:02:51.514 --> 00:02:54.300
Again, income inequality
is not a good thing.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.761
This next chart,
made by The Equality Trust,

00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:01.614
shows 21 countries from Austria
to Japan to New Zealand.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:04.818
On the horizontal axis
is income inequality.

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:08.116
The further to the right you go,
the greater the income inequality.

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:11.459
On the vertical axis
are nine social and health metrics.

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.222
The more you go up that,
the worse the problems are,

00:03:14.222 --> 00:03:19.470
and those metrics include life expectancy,
teenage pregnancy, literacy,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.210
social mobility, just to name a few.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.391
Now, those of you in the audience
who are Americans may wonder,

00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:27.736
well, where does the United States rank?

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:29.593
Where does it lie on that chart?

00:03:29.593 --> 00:03:31.288
And guess what?

00:03:31.288 --> 00:03:33.370
We're literally off the chart.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.793
Yes, that's us,

00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:37.952
with the greatest income inequality

00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:42.248
and the greatest social problems,
according to those metrics.

00:03:42.248 --> 00:03:44.802
Now, here's a macro forecast
that's easy to make,

00:03:44.802 --> 00:03:48.401
and that's, that gap between
the wealthiest and the poorest,

00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:50.421
it will get closed.

00:03:50.421 --> 00:03:52.010
History always does it.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.159
It typically happens in one of three ways:

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:00.560
either through revolution,
higher taxes, or wars.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.889
None of those are on my bucket list.

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.025
(Laughter)

00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:06.086
Now, there's another way to do it,

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:10.226
and that's by increasing justness
in corporate behavior,

00:04:10.226 --> 00:04:12.989
but the way that we're
operating right now,

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.983
that would require
a tremendous change in behavior,

00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:20.930
and like an addict trying to kick a habit,

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.436
the first step is to acknowledge
that you have a problem.

00:04:24.436 --> 00:04:28.337
And let me just say,
this profits mania that we're on

00:04:28.337 --> 00:04:30.636
is so deeply entrenched

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.167
that we don't even realize
how we're harming society.

00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:37.184
Here's a small but startling example
of exactly how we're doing that:

00:04:37.184 --> 00:04:40.247
this chart shows corporate giving

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:45.632
as a percentage of profits, 
not revenues, over the last 30 years.

00:04:45.632 --> 00:04:51.401
Juxtapose that to the earlier chart
of corporate profit margins,

00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:55.528
and I ask you, does that feel right?

00:04:56.758 --> 00:04:59.699
In all fairness, when I
started writing this, I thought,

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.160
"Oh wow, what does my company,
what does Tudor do?"

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.693
And I realized we give one percent
of corporate profits

00:05:07.693 --> 00:05:09.423
to charity every year.

00:05:09.423 --> 00:05:13.324
And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist.

00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:19.623
When I realized that, I literally
wanted to throw up.

00:05:19.623 --> 00:05:22.101
But the point is, this mania
is so deeply entrenched

00:05:22.101 --> 00:05:27.263
that well-intentioned people like myself
don't even realize that we're part of it.

00:05:27.943 --> 00:05:30.274
Now, we're not going
to change corporate behavior

00:05:30.274 --> 00:05:35.591
by simply increasing corporate
philanthropy or charitable contributions.

00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:38.725
And oh, by the way,
we've since quadrupled that,

00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:42.974
but -- (Applause) -- Please.

00:05:42.974 --> 00:05:46.713
But we can do it by driving
more just behavior.

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:49.754
And one way to do it is actually trusting

00:05:49.754 --> 00:05:52.169
the system that got us
here in the first place,

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.282
and that's the free market system.

00:05:54.282 --> 00:05:56.975
About a year ago,
some friends of mine and I

00:05:56.975 --> 00:06:00.025
started a not-for-profit
called Just Capital.

00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:01.493
Its mission is very simple:

00:06:01.493 --> 00:06:03.988
to help companies and corporations

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:09.263
learn how to operate in a more just
fashion by using the public's input

00:06:09.263 --> 00:06:15.574
to define exactly what the criteria are
for just corporate behavior.

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:17.989
Now, right now, there's
no widely accepted standard

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:22.331
that a company or corporation can follow,
and that's where Just Capital comes in,

00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:27.651
because beginning this year and every year
we'll be conducting a nationwide survey

00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:31.781
of a representative sample
of 20,000 Americans

00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:34.701
to find out exactly what they think

00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:38.579
are the criteria for justness
in corporate behavior.

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:41.591
Now, this is a model that's going
to start in the United States

00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:44.226
but can be expanded
anywhere around the globe,

00:06:44.226 --> 00:06:46.107
and maybe we'll find out

00:06:46.107 --> 00:06:48.975
that the most important
thing for the public

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:54.326
is that we create living wage jobs,
or make healthy products,

00:06:54.326 --> 00:06:57.577
or help, not harm, the environment.

00:06:57.577 --> 00:07:01.850
At Just Capital, we don't know,
and it's not for us to decide.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.846
We're but messengers,

00:07:03.846 --> 00:07:07.956
but we have 100 percent confidence 
and faith in the American public

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:09.190
to get it right.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.410
So we'll release the findings
this September for the first time,

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.850
and then next year, we'll poll again,

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.149
and we'll take the additive step this time

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:21.168
of ranking the 1,000
largest U.S. companies

00:07:21.168 --> 00:07:25.720
from number one to number 1,000
and everything in between.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.551
We're calling it the Just Index,

00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:33.800
and remember, we're an independent
not-for-profit with no bias,

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.953
and we will be giving
the American public a voice.

00:07:38.953 --> 00:07:43.156
And maybe over time, we'll find out
that as people come to know

00:07:43.156 --> 00:07:45.176
which companies are the most just,

00:07:45.176 --> 00:07:49.216
human and economic resources
will be driven towards them,

00:07:49.216 --> 00:07:51.190
and they'll become the most prosperous

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.021
and help our country
be the most prosperous.

00:07:55.351 --> 00:07:59.457
Now, capitalism has been responsible
for every major innovation

00:07:59.457 --> 00:08:03.608
that's made this world a more inspiring
and wonderful place to live in.

00:08:04.578 --> 00:08:07.443
Capitalism has to be based on justice.

00:08:07.443 --> 00:08:09.649
It has to be, and now more than ever,

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:13.480
with economic divisions
growing wider every day.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.498
It's estimated that 47 percent
of American workers

00:08:16.498 --> 00:08:19.796
can be displaced in the next 20 years.

00:08:19.796 --> 00:08:21.769
I'm not against progress.

00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:26.650
I want the driverless car and the jet pack
just like everyone else.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:32.500
But I'm pleading for recognition
that with increased wealth and profits

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.930
has to come greater
corporate social responsibility.

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:43.665
"If justice is removed," said Adam Smith,
the father of capitalism,

00:08:43.665 --> 00:08:49.419
"the great, the immense fabric
of human society must in a moment

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:53.626
crumble into atoms."

00:08:53.626 --> 00:08:57.390
Now, when I was young,
and there was a problem,

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.573
my mama used to always
sigh and shake her head and say,

00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:05.630
"Have mercy, have mercy."

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:10.181
Now's not the time for us,
for the rest of us to show them mercy.

00:09:10.181 --> 00:09:13.370
The time is now for us
to show them fairness,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.846
and we can do that, you and I,

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:21.100
by starting where we work,
in the businesses that we operate in.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.460
And when we put justness
on par with profits,

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.408
we'll get the most wonderful thing
in all the world.

00:09:28.408 --> 00:09:31.774
We'll take back our humanity.

00:09:31.774 --> 00:09:34.421
Thank you.

00:09:34.421 --> 00:09:38.246
(Applause)
