WEBVTT

00:00:00.765 --> 00:00:02.276
Well, you know, sometimes

00:00:02.276 --> 00:00:05.258
the most important things come
in the smallest packages.

00:00:05.258 --> 00:00:08.847
I am going to try to convince you,
in the 15 minutes I have,

00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:13.100
that microbes have a lot to say
about questions such as,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.998
"Are we alone?"

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:20.223
and they can tell us more about
not only life in our solar system

00:00:20.223 --> 00:00:22.100
but also maybe beyond,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.397
and this is why I am tracking them down
in the most impossible places on Earth,

00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:29.766
in extreme environments where conditions

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.450
are really pushing them
to the brink of survival.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.704
Actually, sometimes me too,
when I'm trying to follow them too close.

00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:37.521
But here's the thing:

00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:43.134
We are the only advanced civilization
in the solar system,

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:46.878
but that doesn't mean that there is
no microbial life nearby.

00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:50.663
In fact, the planets
and moons you see here

00:00:50.663 --> 00:00:54.633
could host life -- all of them --
and we know that,

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.482
and it's a strong possibility.

00:00:57.482 --> 00:01:02.135
And if we were going to find life
on those moons and planets,

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:05.151
then we would answer questions such as,

00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:07.287
are we alone in the solar system?

00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:09.256
Where are we coming from?

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:12.233
Do we have family in the neighborhood?

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:16.157
Is there life beyond our solar system?

00:01:16.157 --> 00:01:20.244
And we can ask all those questions
because there has been a revolution

00:01:20.244 --> 00:01:24.520
in our understanding
of what a habitable planet is,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.860
and today, a habitable planet is a planet

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.193
that has a zone where
water can stay stable,

00:01:32.193 --> 00:01:35.922
but to me this is a horizontal
definition of habitability,

00:01:35.922 --> 00:01:38.197
because it involves a distance to a star,

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:41.169
but there is another
dimension to habitability,

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:43.350
and this is a vertical dimension.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.527
Think of it as

00:01:47.527 --> 00:01:54.210
conditions in the subsurface of a planet
where you are very far away from a sun,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.353
but you still have water,
energy, nutrients,

00:01:57.353 --> 00:01:59.304
which for some of them means food,

00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:01.207
and a protection.

00:02:01.207 --> 00:02:03.251
And when you look at the Earth,

00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:07.796
very far away from any sunlight,
deep in the ocean,

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:09.665
you have life thriving

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:13.676
and it uses only chemistry
for life processes.

00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:19.326
So when you think of it 
at that point, all walls collapse.

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:21.600
You have no limitations, basically.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.160
And if you have been looking
at the headlines lately,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.120
then you will see that we have
discovered a subsurface ocean

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.989
on Europa, on Ganymede,
on Enceladus, on Titan,

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.923
and now we are finding a geyser
and hot springs on Enceladus,

00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:37.978
Our solar system is turning
into a giant spa.

00:02:37.978 --> 00:02:41.864
For anybody who has gone to a spa
knows how much microbes like that, right?

00:02:41.864 --> 00:02:43.582
(Laughter)

00:02:43.582 --> 00:02:47.111
So at that point, think also about Mars.

00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:50.478
There is no life possible
at the surface of Mars today,

00:02:50.478 --> 00:02:53.729
but it might still be hiding underground.

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:59.339
So, we have been making progress
in our understanding of habitability,

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.111
but we also have been making progress
in our understanding

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:05.687
of what the signatures
of life are on Earth.

00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:08.543
And you can have what we call
organic molecules,

00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:10.470
and these are the bricks of life,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.350
and you can have fossils,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.253
and you can minerals, biominerals,

00:03:15.253 --> 00:03:18.643
which is due to the reaction
between bacteria and rocks,

00:03:18.643 --> 00:03:21.777
and of course you can have
gases in the atmosphere.

00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:23.983
And when you look at those
tiny green algae

00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:25.934
on the right of the slide here,

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.450
they are the direct descendants
of those who have been pumping oxygen

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.843
a billion years ago
in the atmosphere of the Earth.

00:03:31.843 --> 00:03:34.465
When they did that, they poisoned
90 percent of the life

00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:35.987
at the surface of the Earth,

00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:39.190
but they are the reason why
you are breathing this air today.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.925
But as much as our understanding grows
of all of these things,

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:48.851
there is one question
we still cannot answer,

00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.126
and this is, where are we coming from?

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:52.844
And you know, it's getting worse,

00:03:52.844 --> 00:03:55.886
because we won't be able
to find the physical evidence

00:03:55.886 --> 00:03:58.440
of where we are coming from
on this planet,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.130
and the reason being is that anything that
is older than four billion years is gone.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.754
All record is gone,

00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:09.632
erased by plate tectonics and erosion.

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:13.184
This is what I call the Earth's
biological horizon.

00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:16.667
Beyond this horizon we don't know
where we are coming from.

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:19.593
So is everything lost? Well, maybe not.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:23.308
And we might be able to find
evidence of our own origin

00:04:23.308 --> 00:04:26.419
in the most unlikely place,
and this place in Mars.

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:29.420
How is this possible?

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.201
Well clearly at the beginning
of the solar system,

00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:37.169
Mars and the Earth were bombarded
by giant asteroids and comets,

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.327
and there were ejecta
from these impacts all over the place.

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:44.187
Earth and Mars kept throwing rocks
at each other for a very long time.

00:04:44.187 --> 00:04:46.230
Pieces of rocks landed on the Earth.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.181
Pieces of the Earth landed on Mars.

00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:53.359
So clearly, those two planets may have
been seeded by the same material.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:57.283
So yeah, maybe Granddady is sitting
there on the surface and waiting for us.

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:06.190
But that also means that we can go to Mars
and try to find traces of our own origin.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.442
Mars may hold that secret for us.

00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:11.150
This is why Mars is so special to us.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.160
But for that to happen,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.544
Mars needed to be habitable
at the time when conditions were right.

00:05:18.544 --> 00:05:20.400
So was Mars habitable?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.254
We have a number of missions
telling us exactly the same thing today.

00:05:24.254 --> 00:05:27.992
At the time when life
appeared on the Earth,

00:05:27.992 --> 00:05:32.830
Mars did have an ocean,
it had volcanoes, it had lakes,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.673
and it had deltas like the beautiful
picture you see here.

00:05:35.673 --> 00:05:39.460
This picture was sent by the Curiosity 
rover only a few weeks ago.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.142
It shows the remnants of a delta,
and this picture tells us something:

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.096
water was abundant

00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:47.757
and stayed founting at the surface
for a very long time.

00:05:47.757 --> 00:05:49.568
This is good news for life.

00:05:49.568 --> 00:05:52.990
Life chemistry takes a long time
to actually happen.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.507
So this is extremely good news,

00:05:54.507 --> 00:05:58.127
but does that mean that if we go there,
life will be easy to find on Mars?

00:05:58.127 --> 00:06:00.010
Not necessarily.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.861
Here's what happened:

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:05.230
At the time when life exploded
at the surface of the Earth,

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.369
then everything went south for Mars,

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:08.901
literally.

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:12.472
The atmosphere was
stripped away by solar winds,

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.775
Mars lost its magnetosphere,

00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:19.187
and then cosmic rays and U.V.
bombarded the surface

00:06:19.187 --> 00:06:23.410
and water escaped to space
and went underground.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.501
So if we want to be able to understand,

00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:31.430
if we want to be able to find those traces
of the signatures of life

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.644
at the surface of Mars, if they are there,

00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:36.831
we need to understand what was
the impact of each of these events

00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:40.484
on the preservation of its record.

00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:45.314
Only then will we be able
to know where those signatures are hiding,

00:06:45.314 --> 00:06:48.997
and only then will we be able
to send our rover to the right places

00:06:48.997 --> 00:06:52.146
where we can sample those rocks
that may be telling us something

00:06:52.146 --> 00:06:54.862
really important about who we are,

00:06:54.862 --> 00:06:58.972
or, if not, maybe telling us
that somewhere, independently,

00:06:58.972 --> 00:07:01.828
life has appeared on another planet.

00:07:01.828 --> 00:07:04.336
So to do that, it's easy.

00:07:04.336 --> 00:07:07.894
You only need to go back
3.5 billion years ago

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:10.285
in the past of a planet.

00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:12.909
We just need a time machine.

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:15.103
Easy, right?

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:16.673
Well, actually, it is.

00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:18.574
Look around you -- that's planet Earth.

00:07:18.574 --> 00:07:20.618
This is our time machine.

00:07:20.618 --> 00:07:24.788
Geologists are using it
to go back in the past of our own planet.

00:07:24.788 --> 00:07:26.971
I am using it a little bit differently.

00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:29.966
I use planet Earth to go
in very extreme environments

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:32.868
where conditions were similar
to those of Mars

00:07:32.868 --> 00:07:34.865
at the time when the climate changed,

00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:37.745
and there I'm trying 
to understand what happened.

00:07:37.745 --> 00:07:39.439
What are the signatures of life?

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:42.272
What is left? How are we going to find it?

00:07:42.272 --> 00:07:45.276
So for one moment now
I'm going to take you with me

00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:48.130
on a trip into that time machine.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.865
And now, what you see here,
we are at 4,500 meters in the Andes,

00:07:52.865 --> 00:07:59.594
but in fact we are less than a billion
years after the Earth and Mars formed.

00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:03.285
The Earth and Mars will have looked
pretty much exactly like that --

00:08:03.285 --> 00:08:06.796
volcanoes everywhere,
evaporating lakes everywhere,

00:08:06.796 --> 00:08:10.103
minerals, hot springs,

00:08:10.103 --> 00:08:13.934
and then you see those mounds
on the shore of those lakes?

00:08:13.934 --> 00:08:17.394
Those are built by the descendants
of the first organisms

00:08:17.394 --> 00:08:20.496
that gave us the first fossil on Earth.

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:24.555
But if we want to understand what's 
going on, we need to go a little further.

00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:26.470
And the other thing about those sites

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.946
is that exactly like on Mars
three and a half billion years ago,

00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:34.463
the climate is changing very fast,
and water and ice are disappearing.

00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:37.678
But we need to go back to that time
when everything changed on Mars,

00:08:37.678 --> 00:08:39.761
and to do that, we need to go higher.

00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:41.858
Why is that?

00:08:41.858 --> 00:08:43.215
Because when you go higher,

00:08:43.215 --> 00:08:46.337
the atmosphere is getting thinner,
it's getting more unstable,

00:08:46.337 --> 00:08:51.648
the temperature is getting cooler,
and you have a lot more U.V. radiation.

00:08:51.648 --> 00:08:52.457
Basically,

00:08:52.457 --> 00:08:57.191
you are getting to those conditions
on Mars when everything changed.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:04.837
So I was not promising anything about
a leisurely trip on the time machine.

00:09:04.837 --> 00:09:07.371
You are not going to be sitting
in that time machine.

00:09:07.371 --> 00:09:10.399
You have to haul 1,000 pounds
of equipment to the summit

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:14.184
of this 20,000-foot volcano
in the Andes here.

00:09:14.184 --> 00:09:16.784
That's about 6,000 meters.

00:09:16.784 --> 00:09:20.407
And you also have to sleep
on 42-degree slopes

00:09:20.407 --> 00:09:23.518
and really hope that there won't
be any earthquake that night.

00:09:23.518 --> 00:09:28.464
But when we get to the summit,
we actually find the lake we came for.

00:09:28.464 --> 00:09:33.126
At this altitude, this lake is
experiencing exactly the same conditions

00:09:33.126 --> 00:09:36.245
as those on Mars
three and a half billion years ago.

00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:39.170
And now we have to change our voyage

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.890
into an inner voyage inside that lake,

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.541
and to do that, we have to remove
our mountain gear

00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:49.847
and actually don suits and go for it.

00:09:50.277 --> 00:09:54.452
But at the time we enter that lake,
at the very moment we enter that lake,

00:09:54.452 --> 00:09:56.380
we are stepping back

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.561
three and a half billion years
in the past of another planet,

00:09:59.561 --> 00:10:03.661
and then we are going to get
the answer came for.

00:10:04.511 --> 00:10:07.633
Life is everywhere, absolutely everywhere.

00:10:07.633 --> 00:10:10.953
Everything you see in this picture
is a living organism.

00:10:10.953 --> 00:10:14.446
Maybe not so the diver,
but everything else.

00:10:15.626 --> 00:10:18.853
But this picture is very deceiving.

00:10:18.853 --> 00:10:21.523
Life is abundant in those lakes,

00:10:21.523 --> 00:10:25.630
but like in many places on Earth 
right now and due to climate change,

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.324
there is a huge loss in biodiversity.

00:10:28.744 --> 00:10:31.740
In the samples that we took back home,

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.556
36 percent of the bacteria in those lakes
were composed of three species,

00:10:37.556 --> 00:10:41.375
and those three species are the ones
that have survived so far.

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:44.162
Here's another lake,
right next to the first one.

00:10:44.162 --> 00:10:47.830
The red color you see here
is not due to minerals.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.151
It's actually due to the presence
of a tiny algae.

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:55.660
In this region, the U.V. radiation
is really nasty.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.129
Anywhere on Earth, 11
is considered to be extreme.

00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:03.160
During U.V. storms there,
the U.V. Index reaches 43.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.976
SPF 30 is not going to do anything 
to you over there,

00:11:07.976 --> 00:11:11.342
and the water is so
transparent in those lakes

00:11:11.342 --> 00:11:14.675
that the algae has
nowhere to hide, really,

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.965
and so they are developing
their own sunscreen,

00:11:16.965 --> 00:11:18.749
and this is the red color you see.

00:11:18.749 --> 00:11:21.310
But they can adapt only so far,

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.788
and then when all the water
is gone from the surface,

00:11:23.788 --> 00:11:26.388
microbes have only one solution left:

00:11:26.388 --> 00:11:28.246
They go underground.

00:11:28.246 --> 00:11:31.171
And those microbes, the rocks
you see in that slide here,

00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:34.391
well, they are actually
living inside rocks

00:11:34.391 --> 00:11:37.585
and they are using the protection
of the translucence of the rocks

00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:39.382
to get the good part of the U.V.

00:11:39.382 --> 00:11:43.126
and discard the part that could
actually damage their DNA.

00:11:43.126 --> 00:11:45.401
And this is why we are taking our rover

00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:48.977
to train them to search 
for life on Mars in these areas,

00:11:48.977 --> 00:11:52.714
because if there was life on Mars
three and a half billion years ago,

00:11:52.714 --> 00:11:57.074
it had to use the same strategy
to actually protect itself.

00:11:57.864 --> 00:12:00.242
Now, it is pretty obvious

00:12:00.242 --> 00:12:03.770
that going to extreme environments
is helping us very much

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.761
for the exploration of Mars 
and to prepare missions.

00:12:07.761 --> 00:12:12.100
So far, it has helped us to understand
the geology of Mars.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.221
It has helped to understand the past
climate of Mars and its evolution,

00:12:16.221 --> 00:12:19.208
but also its habitability potential.

00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:24.747
Our most recent rover on Mars
has discovered traces of organics.

00:12:24.747 --> 00:12:27.706
Yeah, there are organics
at the surface of Mars.

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:31.607
And it also discovered traces of methane.

00:12:31.607 --> 00:12:34.152
And we don't know yet
if the methane in question

00:12:34.152 --> 00:12:37.990
is really from geology or biology.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.859
Regardless, what we know is
that because of the discovery,

00:12:42.859 --> 00:12:46.100
the hypothesis that there is still
life present on Mars today

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.455
remains a viable one.

00:12:48.455 --> 00:12:53.652
So by now, I think I have convinced you
that Mars is very special to us,

00:12:53.652 --> 00:12:56.628
but it would be a mistake to think
that Mars is the only place

00:12:56.628 --> 00:13:01.574
in the solar system that is interesting
to find potential microbial life.

00:13:02.434 --> 00:13:06.352
And the reason is because
Mars and the Earth

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:09.143
could have a common root
to their tree of life,

00:13:09.143 --> 00:13:13.290
but when you go beyond Mars,
it's not that easy.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.900
Celestial mechanics 
is not making it so easy

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.315
for an exchange
of material between planets,

00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:22.355
and so if we were to discover
life on those planets,

00:13:22.355 --> 00:13:24.212
it would be different from us.

00:13:24.212 --> 00:13:26.050
It would be a different type of life.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.903
But in the end, it might be just us,

00:13:28.903 --> 00:13:30.899
it might be us and Mars,

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:34.382
or it can be many trees of life
in the solar system.

00:13:34.382 --> 00:13:38.110
I don't know the answer yet,
but I can tell you something:

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.542
No matter what the result is,
no matter what that magic number is,

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:44.553
it is going to give us a standard

00:13:44.553 --> 00:13:49.081
by which we are going to be able 
to measure the life potential,

00:13:49.081 --> 00:13:52.191
abundance and diversity
beyond our own solar system.

00:13:52.191 --> 00:13:54.751
And this can be achieved
by our generation.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:58.614
This can be our legacy,
but only if we dare to explore.

00:13:59.654 --> 00:14:01.740
Now, finally,

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.708
if somebody tells you that looking 
for alien microbes is not cool

00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:09.138
because you cannot have
a philosophical conversation with them,

00:14:09.138 --> 00:14:15.014
let me show you why and how
you can tell them they're wrong.

00:14:15.804 --> 00:14:18.572
Well, organic material
is going to tell you

00:14:18.572 --> 00:14:24.231
about environment, about complexity
and about diversity.

00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:30.350
DNA, or any information carrier,
is going to tell you about adaptation,

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:35.371
about evolution, about survival,
about planetary changes

00:14:35.371 --> 00:14:38.219
and about the transfer of information.

00:14:38.219 --> 00:14:41.307
All together, they are telling us

00:14:41.307 --> 00:14:45.208
what started as a microbial pathway,

00:14:45.208 --> 00:14:48.226
and why what started
as a microbial pathway

00:14:48.226 --> 00:14:51.686
sometimes ends up as a civilization

00:14:51.686 --> 00:14:55.308
or sometimes ends up as a dead end.

00:14:55.308 --> 00:14:58.724
Look at the solar system,
and look at the Earth.

00:14:58.724 --> 00:15:01.531
On Earth, there are many
intelligent species,

00:15:01.531 --> 00:15:04.898
but only one has achieved technology.

00:15:04.898 --> 00:15:08.195
Right here in the journey
of our own solar system,

00:15:08.195 --> 00:15:10.934
there is a very, very powerful message

00:15:10.934 --> 00:15:16.320
that says here's how we should look 
for alien life, small and big.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.618
So yeah, microbes are talking
and we are listening,

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:21.337
and they are taking us,

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:23.891
one planet at a time
and one moon at a time,

00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:26.770
towards their big brothers out there.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.486
And they are telling us about diversity,

00:15:29.486 --> 00:15:32.110
they are telling us about
abundance of life,

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:36.150
and they are telling us
how this life has survived thus far

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.192
to reach civilization,

00:15:39.192 --> 00:15:44.174
intelligence, technology
and, indeed, philosophy.

00:15:44.174 --> 00:15:45.879
Thank you.

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:49.115
(Applause)
