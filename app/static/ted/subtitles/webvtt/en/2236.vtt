00:00:00.714 --> 00:00:03.918
Hi. I'm going to talk 
to you today about laughter,

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:06.707
and I just want to start 
by thinking about the first time

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:08.736
I can ever remember noticing laughter.

00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:11.558
This is when I was a little girl.
I would've been about six.

00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:15.113
And I came across my parents
doing something unusual,

00:00:15.113 --> 00:00:16.619
where they were laughing.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.686
They were laughing very, very hard.

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:20.590
They were lying on the floor laughing.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.540
They were screaming with laughter.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.767
I did not know what they were 
laughing at, but I wanted in.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:28.471
I wanted to be part of that,

00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:31.570
and I kind of sat around at the edge
going, "Hoo hoo!" (Laughter)

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.009
Now, incidentally,
what they were laughing at

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:37.609
was a song which people used to sing,

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.255
which was based around
signs in toilets on trains

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.250
telling you what you could
and could not do

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.690
in toilets on trains.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.893
And the thing you have to remember
about the English is, of course,

00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:51.616
we do have an immensely
sophisticated sense of humor.

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:52.775
(Laughter)

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:55.508
At the time, though, I didn't
understand anything of that.

00:00:55.508 --> 00:00:57.067
I just cared about the laughter,

00:00:57.067 --> 00:01:00.419
and actually, as a neuroscientist,
I've come to care about it again.

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:03.176
And it is a really weird thing to do.

00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:05.593
What I'm going to do now
is just play some examples

00:01:05.593 --> 00:01:07.144
of real human beings laughing,

00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:10.627
and I want you think about the sound
people make and how odd that can be,

00:01:10.627 --> 00:01:13.204
and in fact how primitive
laughter is as a sound.

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:16.013
It's much more like an animal call
than it is like speech.

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:19.487
So here we've got some laughter for you.
The first one is pretty joyful.

00:01:19.487 --> 00:01:33.142
(Audio: Laughing)

00:01:35.406 --> 00:01:38.081
Now this next guy, I need him to breathe.

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:40.233
There's a point in there
where I'm just, like,

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.255
you've got to get some air in there, mate,

00:01:42.255 --> 00:01:44.460
because he just sounds
like he's breathing out.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.187
(Audio: Laughing)

00:01:53.187 --> 00:01:56.182
This hasn't been edited; this is him.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:02:02.544
(Audio: Laughing)
(Laughter)

00:02:02.544 --> 00:02:06.283
And finally we have -- 
this is a human female laughing.

00:02:06.283 --> 00:02:10.346
And laughter can take us to some pretty
odd places in terms of making noises.

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:19.135
(Audio: Laughing)

00:02:29.953 --> 00:02:32.613
She actually says, "Oh my God,
what is that?" in French.

00:02:32.613 --> 00:02:36.179
We're all kind of with her.
I have no idea.

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.606
Now, to understand laughter,
you have to look at a part of the body

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:43.430
that psychologists and neuroscientists
don't normally spend much time looking at,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.495
which is the ribcage,

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:46.311
and it doesn't seem terribly exciting,

00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.990
but actually you're all using 
your ribcage all the time.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.573
What you're all doing 
at the moment with your ribcage,

00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:53.413
and don't stop doing it, is breathing.

00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:56.563
So you use the intercostal muscles,
the muscles between your ribs,

00:02:56.563 --> 00:02:58.340
to bring air in and out of your lungs

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.530
just by expanding
and contracting your ribcage,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.408
and if I was to put a strap 
around the outside of your chest

00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:05.978
called a breath belt, and just look 
at that movement,

00:03:05.978 --> 00:03:09.132
you see a rather gentle sinusoidal
movement, so that's breathing.

00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:10.710
You're all doing it. Don't stop.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.104
As soon as you start talking,

00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:14.731
you start using your breathing
completely differently.

00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:17.678
So what I'm doing now is you see
something much more like this.

00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:20.271
In talking, you use very fine
movements of the ribcage

00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:21.651
to squeeze the air out --

00:03:21.651 --> 00:03:24.140
and in fact, we're the only animals
that can do this.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.681
It's why we can talk at all.

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:28.843
Now, both talking and breathing
has a mortal enemy,

00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:31.209
and that enemy is laughter,

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.658
because what happens when you laugh

00:03:33.658 --> 00:03:36.959
is those same muscles
start to contract very regularly,

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.377
and you get this very marked
sort of zig-zagging,

00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:41.560
and that's just squeezing
the air out of you.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.027
It literally is that basic a way
of making a sound.

00:03:44.027 --> 00:03:47.023
You could be stamping on somebody,
it's having the same effect.

00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:48.507
You're just squeezing air out,

00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:51.340
and each of those contractions --
Ha! -- gives you a sound.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.303
And as the contractions run together,
you can get these spasms,

00:03:54.303 --> 00:03:58.083
and that's when you start getting
these -- (Wheezing) -- things happening.

00:03:58.083 --> 00:04:01.577
I'm brilliant at this. (Laughter)

00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:05.802
Now, in terms of the science of laughter,
there isn't very much,

00:04:05.802 --> 00:04:08.850
but it does turn out that pretty much
everything we think we know

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.042
about laughter is wrong.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.998
So it's not at all unusual, for example,
to hear people to say

00:04:13.998 --> 00:04:16.001
humans are the only animals that laugh.

00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:18.934
Nietzsche thought that humans
are the only animals that laugh.

00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:21.387
In fact, you find laughter
throughout the mammals.

00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:23.973
It's been well-described
and well-observed in primates,

00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:25.377
but you also see it in rats,

00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:26.683
and wherever you find it --

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.789
humans, primates, rats --

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.808
you find it associated
with things like tickling.

00:04:31.808 --> 00:04:34.896
That's the same for humans.

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:39.563
You find it associated with play,
and all mammals play.

00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:43.557
And wherever you find it,
it's associated with interactions.

00:04:43.557 --> 00:04:46.147
So Robert Provine, who has done
a lot of work on this,

00:04:46.147 --> 00:04:50.987
has pointed out that you are 30 times 
more likely to laugh

00:04:50.987 --> 00:04:54.353
if you are with somebody else
than if you're on your own,

00:04:54.353 --> 00:04:56.257
and where you find most laughter

00:04:56.257 --> 00:04:58.984
is in social interactions
like conversation.

00:04:58.984 --> 00:05:01.226
So if you ask human beings,
"When do you laugh?"

00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:05.177
they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk
about humor and they'll talk about jokes.

00:05:05.177 --> 00:05:08.376
If you look at when they laugh,
they're laughing with their friends.

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:11.963
And when we laugh with people, we're
hardly ever actually laughing at jokes.

00:05:11.963 --> 00:05:14.626
You are laughing to show people
that you understand them,

00:05:14.626 --> 00:05:17.874
that you agree with them, that you're
part of the same group as them.

00:05:17.874 --> 00:05:19.873
You're laughing to show
that you like them.

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:21.078
You might even love them.

00:05:21.078 --> 00:05:23.788
You're doing all that at the same time
as talking to them,

00:05:23.788 --> 00:05:26.808
and the laughter is doing a lot
of that emotional work for you.

00:05:26.808 --> 00:05:29.986
Something that Robert Provine
has pointed out, as you can see here,

00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:31.665
and the reason why we were laughing

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.806
when we heard those
funny laughs at the start,

00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:36.511
and why I was laughing
when I found my parents laughing,

00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:39.346
is that it's an enormously
behaviorally contagious effect.

00:05:39.346 --> 00:05:41.440
You can catch laughter from somebody else,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.099
and you are more likely to catch laughter
off somebody else if you know them.

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.358
So it's still modulated
by this social context.

00:05:47.358 --> 00:05:48.946
You have to put humor to one side


00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:51.167
and think about the social 
meaning of laughter

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:53.255
because that's where its origins lie.

00:05:53.255 --> 00:05:57.435
Now, something I've got very interested in
is different kinds of laughter,

00:05:57.435 --> 00:06:02.148
and we have some neurobiological evidence
about how human beings vocalize

00:06:02.148 --> 00:06:06.281
that suggests there might be
two kinds of laughs that we have.

00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:11.227
So it seems possible that the neurobiology
for helpless, involuntary laughter,

00:06:11.227 --> 00:06:14.431
like my parents lying on the floor
screaming about a silly song,

00:06:14.431 --> 00:06:17.465
might have a different basis to it
than some of that more polite

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:20.631
social laughter that you encounter,
which isn't horrible laughter,

00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:24.949
but it's behavior somebody is doing
as part of their communicative act to you,

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.050
part of their interaction with you;
they are choosing to do this.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.439
In our evolution, we have developed
two different ways of vocalizing.

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:34.356
Involuntary vocalizations
are part of an older system

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:37.559
than the more voluntary vocalizations
like the speech I'm doing now.

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:41.040
So we might imagine that laughter
might actually have two different roots.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.088
So I've been looking at this
in more detail.

00:06:43.088 --> 00:06:46.311
To do this, we've had to make
recordings of people laughing,

00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:49.088
and we've had to do whatever it takes
to make people laugh,

00:06:49.088 --> 00:06:52.297
and we got those same people
to produce more posed, social laughter.

00:06:52.297 --> 00:06:53.965
So imagine your friend told a joke,

00:06:53.965 --> 00:06:56.253
and you're laughing because
you like your friend,

00:06:56.253 --> 00:06:58.261
but not really because
the joke's all that.

00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:00.354
So I'm going to play you 
a couple of those.

00:07:00.354 --> 00:07:03.507
I want you to tell me if you think
this laughter is real laughter,

00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:04.806
or if you think it's posed.

00:07:04.806 --> 00:07:07.742
So is this involuntary laughter
or more voluntary laughter?

00:07:07.742 --> 00:07:12.622
(Audio: Laughing)

00:07:12.622 --> 00:07:14.237
What does that sound like to you?

00:07:14.237 --> 00:07:16.310
Audience: Posed.
Sophie Scott: Posed? Posed.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.819
How about this one?

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:22.370
(Audio: Laughing)

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.802
(Laughter)

00:07:23.802 --> 00:07:25.218
I'm the best.

00:07:25.218 --> 00:07:27.857
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:27.857 --> 00:07:29.593
Not really.

00:07:29.593 --> 00:07:31.843
No, that was helpless laughter,

00:07:31.843 --> 00:07:35.118
and in fact, to record that,
all they had to do was record me

00:07:35.118 --> 00:07:38.895
watching one of my friends listening to
something I knew she wanted to laugh at,

00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:40.365
and I just started doing this.

00:07:40.365 --> 00:07:43.582
What you find is that people
are good at telling the difference

00:07:43.582 --> 00:07:45.127
between real and posed laughter.

00:07:45.127 --> 00:07:47.041
They seem to be different things to us.

00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:50.073
Interestingly, you see something
quite similar with chimpanzees.

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.621
Chimpanzees laugh differently
if they're being tickled

00:07:52.621 --> 00:07:54.590
than if they're playing with each other,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.852
and we might be seeing
something like that here,

00:07:56.852 --> 00:08:00.546
involuntary laughter, tickling laughter,
being different from social laughter.

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:02.287
They're acoustically very different.

00:08:02.287 --> 00:08:04.779
The real laughs are longer.
They're higher in pitch.

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:06.198
When you start laughing hard,

00:08:06.198 --> 00:08:08.251
you start squeezing air out
from your lungs

00:08:08.251 --> 00:08:11.442
under much higher pressures
than you could ever produce voluntarily.

00:08:11.442 --> 00:08:14.364
For example, I could never
pitch my voice that high to sing.

00:08:14.364 --> 00:08:18.032
Also, you start to get these sort of
contractions and weird whistling sounds,

00:08:18.032 --> 00:08:20.798
all of which mean that real laughter
is extremely easy,

00:08:20.798 --> 00:08:22.870
or feels extremely easy to spot.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.952
In contrast, posed laughter,
we might think it sounds a bit fake.

00:08:27.952 --> 00:08:30.692
Actually, it's not, it's actually
an important social cue.

00:08:30.692 --> 00:08:33.769
We use it a lot, we're choosing
to laugh in a lot of situations,

00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:35.382
and it seems to be its own thing.

00:08:35.382 --> 00:08:38.169
So, for example, you find
nasality in posed laughter,

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.276
that kind of "ha ha ha ha ha" sound

00:08:40.276 --> 00:08:43.723
that you never get, you could not do,
if you were laughing involuntarily.

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:46.955
So they do seem to be genuinely
these two different sorts of things.

00:08:46.955 --> 00:08:49.505
We took it into the scanner
to see how brains respond

00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:50.717
when you hear laughter.

00:08:50.717 --> 00:08:53.385
And when you do this,
this is a really boring experiment.

00:08:53.385 --> 00:08:55.430
We just played people
real and posed laughs.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.634
We didn't tell them
it was a study on laughter.

00:08:57.634 --> 00:08:59.833
We put other sounds in there 
to distract them,

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:02.220
and all they're doing
is lying listening to sounds.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.863
We don't tell them to do anything.

00:09:03.863 --> 00:09:07.337
Nonetheless, when you hear real laughter
and when you hear posed laughter,

00:09:07.337 --> 00:09:09.754
the brains are responding
completely differently,

00:09:09.754 --> 00:09:11.186
significantly differently.

00:09:11.186 --> 00:09:14.734
What you see in the regions in blue,
which lies in auditory cortex,

00:09:14.734 --> 00:09:17.423
are the brain areas that respond
more to the real laughs,

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:18.864
and what seems to be the case,

00:09:18.864 --> 00:09:21.021
when you hear somebody
laughing involuntarily,

00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:23.748
you hear sounds you would never
hear in any other context.

00:09:23.748 --> 00:09:24.834
It's very unambiguous,

00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:27.904
and it seems to be associated
with greater auditory processing

00:09:27.904 --> 00:09:29.274
of these novel sounds.

00:09:29.274 --> 00:09:33.083
In contrast, when you hear somebody
laughing in a posed way,

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:35.125
what you see are these regions in pink,

00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:38.004
which are occupying brain areas
associated with mentalizing,

00:09:38.004 --> 00:09:40.159
thinking about what
somebody else is thinking.

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:41.699
And I think what that means is,

00:09:41.699 --> 00:09:44.896
even if you're having your brain scanned,
which is completely boring

00:09:44.896 --> 00:09:46.096
and not very interesting,

00:09:46.096 --> 00:09:48.429
when you hear somebody going,
"A ha ha ha ha ha,"

00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:50.625
you're trying to work out
why they're laughing.

00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:52.070
Laughter is always meaningful.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.410
You are always trying
to understand it in context,

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.276
even if, as far as you are concerned,
at that point in time,

00:09:57.276 --> 00:09:59.463
it has not necessarily
anything to do with you,

00:09:59.463 --> 00:10:02.135
you still want to know
why those people are laughing.

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:06.001
Now, we've had the opportunity to look 
at how people hear real and posed laughter

00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:07.064
across the age range.

00:10:07.064 --> 00:10:09.995
So this is an online experiment
we ran with the Royal Society,

00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:12.099
and here we just asked people
two questions.

00:10:12.099 --> 00:10:13.927
First of all, they heard some laughs,

00:10:13.927 --> 00:10:16.946
and they had to say, how real 
or posed do these laughs sound?

00:10:16.946 --> 00:10:20.403
The real laughs are shown in red
and the posed laughs are shown in blue.

00:10:20.403 --> 00:10:22.300
What you see is there is a rapid onset.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.652
As you get older, you get better
and better at spotting real laughter.

00:10:25.652 --> 00:10:28.977
So six-year-olds are at chance,
they can't really hear the difference.

00:10:28.977 --> 00:10:31.129
By the time you are older, you get better,

00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:34.751
but interestingly, you do not hit
peak performance in this dataset

00:10:34.751 --> 00:10:38.282
until you are in your
late 30s and early 40s.

00:10:38.282 --> 00:10:41.323
You don't understand laughter fully
by the time you hit puberty.

00:10:41.323 --> 00:10:44.620
You don't understand laughter fully
by the time your brain has matured

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.014
at the end of your teens.

00:10:46.014 --> 00:10:49.812
You're learning about laughter
throughout your entire early adult life.

00:10:49.812 --> 00:10:53.614
If we turn the question around and now say
not, what does the laughter sound like

00:10:53.614 --> 00:10:55.666
in terms of being real
or posed, but we say,

00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:58.150
how much does this laughter
make you want to laugh,

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.365
how contagious is this laughter to you,
we see a different profile.

00:11:01.365 --> 00:11:02.868
And here, the younger you are,

00:11:02.868 --> 00:11:05.302
the more you want to join in
when you hear laughter.

00:11:05.302 --> 00:11:08.795
Remember me laughing with my parents
when I had no idea what was going on.

00:11:08.795 --> 00:11:10.021
You really can see this.

00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:11.416
Now everybody, young and old,

00:11:11.416 --> 00:11:14.261
finds the real laughs more contagious
than the posed laughs,

00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:17.171
but as you get older, it all becomes 
less contagious to you.

00:11:17.171 --> 00:11:21.375
Now, either we're all just becoming
really grumpy as we get older,

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:24.304
or it may mean that as you
understand laughter better,

00:11:24.304 --> 00:11:26.393
and you are getting better at doing that,

00:11:26.393 --> 00:11:29.339
you need more than just
hearing people laugh to want to laugh.

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:31.986
You need the social stuff there.

00:11:31.986 --> 00:11:33.960
So we've got a very interesting behavior

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.113
about which a lot of our
lay assumptions are incorrect,

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:40.964
but I'm coming to see that actually
there's even more to laughter

00:11:40.964 --> 00:11:43.695
than it's an important social emotion
we should look at,

00:11:43.695 --> 00:11:46.614
because it turns out
people are phenomenally nuanced

00:11:46.614 --> 00:11:48.201
in terms of how we use laughter.

00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:50.485
There's a really lovely
set of studies coming out

00:11:50.485 --> 00:11:52.579
from Robert Levenson's lab in California,

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:55.055
where he's doing
a longitudinal study with couples.

00:11:55.055 --> 00:11:57.838
He gets married couples,
men and women, into the lab,

00:11:57.838 --> 00:12:00.132
and he gives them
stressful conversations to have

00:12:00.132 --> 00:12:03.664
while he wires them up to a polygraph
so he can see them becoming stressed.

00:12:03.664 --> 00:12:06.899
So you've got the two of them in there,
and he'll say to the husband,

00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:09.681
"Tell me something that your wife does
that irritates you."

00:12:09.681 --> 00:12:11.297
And what you see is immediately --

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:14.624
just run that one through your head
briefly, you and your partner --

00:12:14.624 --> 00:12:18.772
you can imagine everybody gets a bit
more stressed as soon as that starts.

00:12:18.772 --> 00:12:21.396
You can see physically,
people become more stressed.

00:12:21.396 --> 00:12:27.178
What he finds is that the couples
who manage that feeling of stress

00:12:27.178 --> 00:12:30.684
with laughter,
positive emotions like laughter,

00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:34.492
not only immediately become less stressed,

00:12:34.492 --> 00:12:36.906
they can see them
physically feeling better,

00:12:36.906 --> 00:12:40.064
they're dealing with this
unpleasant situation better together,

00:12:40.064 --> 00:12:41.885
they are also the couples that report

00:12:41.885 --> 00:12:44.244
high levels of satisfaction
in their relationship

00:12:44.244 --> 00:12:45.915
and they stay together for longer.

00:12:45.915 --> 00:12:48.236
So in fact, when you look
at close relationships,

00:12:48.236 --> 00:12:50.134
laughter is a phenomenally useful index

00:12:50.134 --> 00:12:52.607
of how people are regulating
their emotions together.

00:12:52.607 --> 00:12:56.032
We're not just emitting it at each other
to show that we like each other,

00:12:56.032 --> 00:12:58.087
we're making ourselves
feel better together.

00:12:58.087 --> 00:13:01.538
Now, I don't think this is going
to be limited to romantic relationships.

00:13:01.538 --> 00:13:04.011
I think this is probably
going to be a characteristic

00:13:04.011 --> 00:13:07.329
of close emotional relationships
such as you might have with friends,

00:13:07.329 --> 00:13:09.158
which explains my next clip,

00:13:09.158 --> 00:13:12.803
which is of a YouTube video of some
young men in the former East Germany

00:13:12.803 --> 00:13:16.309
on making a video to promote
their heavy metal band,

00:13:16.309 --> 00:13:19.211
and it's extremely macho,
and the mood is very serious,

00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:22.323
and I want you to notice
what happens in terms of laughter

00:13:22.323 --> 00:13:24.273
when things go wrong

00:13:24.273 --> 00:13:28.125
and how quickly that happens,
and how that changes the mood.

00:13:29.869 --> 00:13:32.911
He's cold. He's about to get wet.
He's got swimming trunks on,

00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:36.649
got a towel.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.321
Ice.

00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:40.759
What might possibly happen?

00:13:42.593 --> 00:13:44.172
Video starts.

00:13:45.663 --> 00:13:47.562
Serious mood.

00:13:54.744 --> 00:13:59.249
And his friends are already laughing.
They are already laughing, hard.

00:13:59.249 --> 00:14:01.153
He's not laughing yet.

00:14:02.863 --> 00:14:04.512
(Laughter)

00:14:04.512 --> 00:14:06.723
He's starting to go now.

00:14:13.461 --> 00:14:15.518
And now they're all off.

00:14:15.518 --> 00:14:20.556
(Laughter)

00:14:32.653 --> 00:14:34.395
They're on the floor.

00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:38.017
(Laughter)

00:14:43.727 --> 00:14:47.039
The thing I really like about that
is it's all very serious

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:50.764
until he jumps onto the ice, and
as soon as he doesn't go through the ice,

00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:53.027
but also there isn't blood
and bone everywhere,

00:14:53.027 --> 00:14:54.600
his friends start laughing.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.992
And imagine if that had played him out
with him standing there going,

00:14:57.992 --> 00:15:00.436
"No seriously, Heinrich,
I think this is broken,"

00:15:00.436 --> 00:15:03.186
we wouldn't enjoy watching that.
That would be stressful.

00:15:03.186 --> 00:15:06.179
Or if he was running around
with a visibly broken leg laughing,

00:15:06.179 --> 00:15:10.010
and his friends are going, "Heinrich, I
think we need to go to the hospital now,"

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.407
that also wouldn't be funny.

00:15:11.407 --> 00:15:13.069
The fact that the laughter works,

00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:16.031
it gets him from a painful,
embarrassing, difficult situation,

00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:19.116
into a funny situation, into what we're 
actually enjoying there,

00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:21.303
and I think that's 
a really interesting use,

00:15:21.303 --> 00:15:23.281
and it's actually happening all the time.

00:15:23.281 --> 00:15:25.972
For example, I can remember
something like this happening

00:15:25.972 --> 00:15:27.169
at my father's funeral.

00:15:27.169 --> 00:15:29.784
We weren't jumping around
on the ice in our underpants.

00:15:29.784 --> 00:15:32.425
We're not Canadian.

00:15:32.425 --> 00:15:34.880
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:15:34.924 --> 00:15:38.807
These events are always difficult, I had
a relative who was being a bit difficult,

00:15:38.807 --> 00:15:40.337
my mum was not in a good place,

00:15:40.337 --> 00:15:43.621
and I can remember finding myself
just before the whole thing started

00:15:43.621 --> 00:15:47.868
telling this story about something
that happened in a 1970s sitcom,

00:15:47.868 --> 00:15:50.306
and I just thought at the time,
I don't know why I'm doing this,

00:15:50.306 --> 00:15:52.484
and what I realized I was doing

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:55.182
was I was coming up with
something from somewhere

00:15:55.182 --> 00:15:59.571
I could use to make her laugh
together with me.

00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:02.884
It was a very basic reaction
to find some reason we can do this.

00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:05.569
We can laugh together.
We're going to get through this.

00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:07.065
We're going to be okay.

00:16:07.065 --> 00:16:09.496
And in fact, all of us
are doing this all the time.

00:16:09.496 --> 00:16:11.686
You do it so often,
you don't even notice it.

00:16:11.686 --> 00:16:14.101
Everybody underestimates
how often they laugh,

00:16:14.101 --> 00:16:17.119
and you're doing something,
when you laugh with people,

00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:21.949
that's actually letting you access
a really ancient evolutionary system

00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:25.756
that mammals have evolved
to make and maintain social bonds,

00:16:25.756 --> 00:16:29.146
and clearly to regulate emotions,
to make ourselves feel better.

00:16:29.146 --> 00:16:32.536
It's not something specific to humans --
it's a really ancient behavior

00:16:32.536 --> 00:16:36.600
which really helps us regulate how we feel
and makes us feel better.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.502
In other words, when it comes to laughter,

00:16:39.502 --> 00:16:42.172
you and me, baby, ain't nothing 
but mammals. (Laughter)

00:16:42.172 --> 00:16:44.517
Thank you.

00:16:44.517 --> 00:16:51.763
Thank you. (Applause)
