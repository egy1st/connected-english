WEBVTT

00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.619
To be honest, by personality,

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:06.236
I'm just not much of a crier.

00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:10.596
But I think in my career
that's been a good thing.

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:12.630
I'm a civil rights lawyer,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.634
and I've seen some 
horrible things in the world.

00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:20.844
I began my career working 
police abuse cases in the United States.

00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:24.318
And then in 1994, I was sent to Rwanda

00:00:24.318 --> 00:00:29.248
to be the director of the U.N.'s 
genocide investigation.

00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:33.647
It turns out that tears 
just aren't much help

00:00:33.647 --> 00:00:37.176
when you're trying 
to investigate a genocide.

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:42.037
The things I had to see, 
and feel and touch

00:00:42.037 --> 00:00:44.864
were pretty unspeakable.

00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:48.891
What I can tell you is this:

00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:50.988
that the Rwandan genocide

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:56.661
was one of the world's
greatest failures of simple compassion.

00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:01.120
That word, compassion, actually 
comes from two Latin words:

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.642
cum passio, which simply mean 
"to suffer with."

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:10.204
And the things that I saw and experienced

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:12.790
in Rwanda as I got up close
to human suffering,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.129
it did, in moments, move me to tears.

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:18.855
But I just wish that I, 
and the rest of the world,

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:21.370
had been moved earlier.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.034
And not just to tears,

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:26.834
but to actually stop the genocide.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.292
Now by contrast, I've also been involved

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:35.125
with one of the world's greatest
successes of compassion.

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:38.071
And that's the fight against 
global poverty.

00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:40.854
It's a cause that probably
has involved all of us here.

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:42.852
I don't know if your first introduction

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:46.217
might have been choruses of
"We Are the World,"

00:01:46.217 --> 00:01:50.280
or maybe the picture of a sponsored child
on your refrigerator door,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.367
or maybe the birthday you
donated for fresh water.

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:57.581
I don't really remember what my first
introduction to poverty was

00:01:57.581 --> 00:02:01.145
but I do remember the most jarring.

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:03.307
It was when I met Venus --

00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:06.029
she's a mom from Zambia.

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:09.655
She's got three kids and she's a widow.

00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:13.022
When I met her, she had walked
about 12 miles

00:02:13.022 --> 00:02:15.695
in the only garments she owned,

00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:19.957
to come to the capital city
and to share her story.

00:02:19.957 --> 00:02:23.572
She sat down with me for hours,

00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:28.097
just ushered me in to 
the world of poverty.

00:02:28.097 --> 00:02:31.238
She described what it was like 
when the coals on the cooking fire

00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:34.967
finally just went completely cold.

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:39.729
When that last drop 
of cooking oil finally ran out.

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.585
When the last of the food, 
despite her best efforts,

00:02:43.585 --> 00:02:44.693
ran out.

00:02:46.113 --> 00:02:49.096
She had to watch her youngest son, Peter,

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.878
suffer from malnutrition,

00:02:51.878 --> 00:02:55.954
as his legs just slowly bowed 
into uselessness.

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:59.302
As his eyes grew cloudy and dim.

00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:03.480
And then as Peter finally grew cold.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.811
For over 50 years, stories like this
have been moving us to compassion.

00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:14.661
We whose kids have plenty to eat.

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:17.330
And we're moved not only 
to care about global poverty,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.020
but to actually try to do our part 
to stop the suffering.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.493
Now there's plenty of room for critique 
that we haven't done enough,

00:03:25.493 --> 00:03:29.715
and what it is that we've done
hasn't been effective enough,

00:03:29.715 --> 00:03:32.845
but the truth is this:

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:36.396
The fight against global poverty
is probably the broadest,

00:03:36.396 --> 00:03:41.531
longest running manifestation of the 
human phenomenon of compassion

00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.673
in the history of our species.

00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:48.322
And so I'd like to share
a pretty shattering insight

00:03:48.322 --> 00:03:52.615
that might forever change the way
you think about that struggle.

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:55.438
But first, let me begin with what
you probably already know.

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:58.920
Thirty-five years ago, when I would have
been graduating from high school,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.297
they told us that 40,000 kids every day
died because of poverty.

00:04:05.297 --> 00:04:09.669
That number, today, is now 
down to 17,000.

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.675
Way too many, of course,

00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:14.352
but it does mean that every year,

00:04:14.352 --> 00:04:18.900
there's eight million kids who
don't have to die from poverty.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.067
Moreover, the number of 
people in our world

00:04:22.067 --> 00:04:24.230
who are living in extreme poverty,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.567
which is defined as living off
about a dollar and a quarter a day,

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:31.179
that has fallen from 50 percent,

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:34.413
to only 15 percent.

00:04:35.403 --> 00:04:36.853
This is massive progress,

00:04:36.853 --> 00:04:41.678
and this exceeds everybody's 
expectations about what is possible.

00:04:42.258 --> 00:04:45.123
And I think you and I,

00:04:45.123 --> 00:04:49.399
I think, honestly, that we can 
feel proud and encouraged

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:53.284
to see the way that compassion 
actually has the power

00:04:53.284 --> 00:04:58.476
to succeed in stopping 
the suffering of millions.

00:04:58.476 --> 00:05:02.852
But here's the part that you 
might not hear very much about.

00:05:02.852 --> 00:05:07.586
If you move that poverty mark just
up to two dollars a day,

00:05:07.586 --> 00:05:10.585
it turns out that virtually 
the same two billion people

00:05:10.585 --> 00:05:14.397
who were stuck in that harsh poverty
when I was in high school,

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.278
are still stuck there,

00:05:16.278 --> 00:05:18.667
35 years later.

00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:23.686
So why, why are so many billions
still stuck in such harsh poverty?

00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:27.351
Well, let's think about
Venus for a moment.

00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:31.123
Now for decades, my wife and I have been
moved by common compassion

00:05:31.123 --> 00:05:33.952
to sponsor kids, to fund microloans,

00:05:33.952 --> 00:05:37.471
to support generous levels of foreign aid.

00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:40.563
But until I had actually talked to Venus,

00:05:40.563 --> 00:05:43.200
I would have had no idea that 
none of those approaches

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.696
actually addressed why she had
to watch her son die.

00:05:49.806 --> 00:05:54.243
"We were doing fine," Venus told me,

00:05:54.243 --> 00:05:58.785
"until Brutus started to cause trouble."

00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:01.755
Now, Brutus is Venus' neighbor 
and "cause trouble"

00:06:01.755 --> 00:06:05.281
is what happened the day after
Venus' husband died,

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:09.213
when Brutus just came and threw
Venus and the kids out of the house,

00:06:09.213 --> 00:06:12.965
stole all their land, and robbed
their market stall.

00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:19.342
You see, Venus was thrown 
into destitution by violence.

00:06:20.882 --> 00:06:22.891
And then it occurred to me, of course,

00:06:22.891 --> 00:06:26.690
that none of my child sponsorships,
none of the microloans,

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.552
none of the traditional 
anti-poverty programs

00:06:30.552 --> 00:06:34.518
were going to stop Brutus,

00:06:34.518 --> 00:06:37.872
because they weren't meant to.

00:06:37.872 --> 00:06:42.878
This became even more clear
to me when I met Griselda.

00:06:42.878 --> 00:06:47.097
She's a marvelous young girl
living in a very poor community

00:06:47.097 --> 00:06:48.913
in Guatemala.

00:06:48.913 --> 00:06:51.310
And one of the things
we've learned over the years

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.881
is that perhaps the most powerful thing

00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:56.725
that Griselda and her family can do

00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:59.390
to get Griselda and her family 
out of poverty

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.514
is to make sure that she goes to school.

00:07:02.514 --> 00:07:07.239
The experts call this the Girl Effect.

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:11.321
But when we met Griselda, 
she wasn't going to school.

00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:14.878
In fact, she was rarely ever 
leaving her home.

00:07:16.388 --> 00:07:18.173
Days before we met her,

00:07:18.173 --> 00:07:20.818
while she was walking home
from church with her family,

00:07:20.818 --> 00:07:23.133
in broad daylight,

00:07:23.133 --> 00:07:26.610
men from her community 
just snatched her off the street,

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.708
and violently raped her.

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:34.205
See, Griselda had every
opportunity to go to school,

00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:37.626
it just wasn't safe for her to get there.

00:07:37.626 --> 00:07:40.466
And Griselda's not the only one.

00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:43.190
Around the world, poor women and girls

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.301
between the ages of 15 and 44,

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:52.386
they are -- when victims of 
the everyday violence

00:07:52.386 --> 00:07:55.872
of domestic abuse and sexual violence --

00:07:55.872 --> 00:08:00.684
those two forms of violence account
for more death and disability

00:08:00.684 --> 00:08:07.688
than malaria, than car accidents,
than war combined.

00:08:11.298 --> 00:08:16.075
The truth is, the poor of our world
are trapped in whole systems of violence.

00:08:16.075 --> 00:08:20.108
In South Asia, for instance,
I could drive past this rice mill

00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:23.045
and see this man hoisting 
these 100-pound sacks

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.089
of rice upon his thin back.

00:08:25.089 --> 00:08:26.907
But I would have no idea, until later,

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:29.349
that he was actually a slave,

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:33.738
held by violence in that rice mill
since I was in high school.

00:08:34.828 --> 00:08:38.239
Decades of anti-poverty programs
right in his community

00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:42.321
were never able to rescue him
or any of the hundred other slaves

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:45.957
from the beatings and the rapes
and the torture

00:08:45.957 --> 00:08:49.652
of violence inside the rice mill.

00:08:49.652 --> 00:08:54.032
In fact, half a century of 
anti-poverty programs

00:08:54.032 --> 00:08:57.706
have left more poor people in slavery

00:08:57.706 --> 00:09:01.071
than in any other time in human history.

00:09:01.071 --> 00:09:07.050
Experts tell us that there's about
35 million people in slavery today.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.711
That's about the population 
of the entire nation of Canada,

00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:14.179
where we're sitting today.

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:17.483
This is why, over time, I have come
to call this epidemic of violence

00:09:17.483 --> 00:09:19.772
the Locust Effect.

00:09:19.772 --> 00:09:22.783
Because in the lives of the poor,
it just descends like a plague

00:09:22.783 --> 00:09:25.571
and it destroys everything.

00:09:25.571 --> 00:09:29.954
In fact, now when you survey
very, very poor communities,

00:09:29.954 --> 00:09:34.038
residents will tell you that their
greatest fear is violence.

00:09:34.038 --> 00:09:36.607
But notice the violence that they fear

00:09:36.607 --> 00:09:39.785
is not the violence of 
genocide or the wars,

00:09:39.785 --> 00:09:42.140
it's everyday violence.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.353
So for me, as a lawyer, of course,
my first reaction was to think,

00:09:45.353 --> 00:09:47.667
well, of course we've
got to change all the laws.

00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:51.167
We've got to make all this violence
against the poor illegal.

00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:54.902
But then I found out, it already is.

00:09:54.902 --> 00:09:57.742
The problem is not that 
the poor don't get laws,

00:09:57.742 --> 00:10:01.442
it's that they don't get law enforcement.

00:10:02.542 --> 00:10:04.185
In the developing world,

00:10:04.185 --> 00:10:07.250
basic law enforcement systems
are so broken

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.416
that recently the U.N. issued 
a report that found

00:10:10.416 --> 00:10:16.020
that "most poor people live
outside the protection of the law."

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.412
Now honestly, you and I have 
just about no idea

00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:20.009
of what that would mean

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:23.688
because we have no 
first-hand experience of it.

00:10:23.688 --> 00:10:26.765
Functioning law enforcement for us 
is just a total assumption.

00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:31.137
In fact, nothing expresses that assumption
more clearly than three simple numbers:

00:10:31.137 --> 00:10:33.598
9-1-1,

00:10:33.598 --> 00:10:36.765
which, of course, is the number
for the emergency police operator

00:10:36.765 --> 00:10:40.066
here in Canada and in the United States,

00:10:40.066 --> 00:10:44.147
where the average response time 
to a police 911 emergency call

00:10:44.147 --> 00:10:45.810
is about 10 minutes.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.995
So we take this just 
completely for granted.

00:10:48.995 --> 00:10:53.512
But what if there was no 
law enforcement to protect you?

00:10:54.582 --> 00:10:59.204
A woman in Oregon recently
experienced what this would be like.

00:10:59.204 --> 00:11:03.545
She was home alone in her 
dark house on a Saturday night,

00:11:03.545 --> 00:11:06.510
when a man started to tear 
his way into her home.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.467
This was her worst nightmare,

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:13.075
because this man had actually put her
in the hospital from an assault

00:11:13.075 --> 00:11:15.193
just two weeks before.

00:11:15.193 --> 00:11:18.551
So terrified, she picks up that phone
and does what any of us would do:

00:11:18.551 --> 00:11:21.196
She calls 911 --

00:11:21.196 --> 00:11:26.028
but only to learn that because 
of budget cuts in her county,

00:11:26.028 --> 00:11:29.397
law enforcement wasn't available 
on the weekends.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.187
Listen.

00:11:30.187 --> 00:11:33.006
Dispatcher: I don't have anybody 
to send out there.

00:11:33.006 --> 00:11:34.023
Woman: OK

00:11:34.023 --> 00:11:38.126
Dispatcher: Um, obviously if he comes
inside the residence and assaults you,

00:11:38.126 --> 00:11:39.799
can you ask him to go away?

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:42.042
Or do you know if
he is intoxicated or anything?

00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:45.415
Woman: I've already asked him.
I've already told him I was calling you.

00:11:45.415 --> 00:11:48.088
He's broken in before,
busted down my door, assaulted me.

00:11:48.088 --> 00:11:49.033
Dispatcher: Uh-huh.

00:11:49.033 --> 00:11:50.186
Woman: Um, yeah, so ...

00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:53.405
Dispatcher: Is there any way you could
safely leave the residence?

00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:56.822
Woman: No, I can't, because he's blocking
pretty much my only way out.

00:11:56.822 --> 00:11:59.968
Dispatcher: Well, the only thing I can do 
is give you some advice,

00:11:59.968 --> 00:12:02.684
and call the sheriff's office tomorrow.

00:12:02.684 --> 00:12:07.496
Obviously, if he comes in and
unfortunately has a weapon

00:12:07.496 --> 00:12:10.822
or is trying to cause you physical harm,
that's a different story.

00:12:10.822 --> 00:12:13.489
You know, the sheriff's office
doesn't work up there.

00:12:13.489 --> 00:12:16.145
I don't have anybody to send."

00:12:17.735 --> 00:12:20.388
Gary Haugen: Tragically, the woman 
inside that house

00:12:20.388 --> 00:12:26.327
was violently assaulted, choked and raped


00:12:26.327 --> 00:12:32.371
because this is what it means to live
outside the rule of law.

00:12:33.841 --> 00:12:37.855
And this is where billions
of our poorest live.

00:12:40.015 --> 00:12:42.443
What does that look like?

00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:46.871
In Bolivia, for example, if a man 
sexually assaults a poor child,

00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:51.544
statistically, he's at greater risk
of slipping in the shower and dying

00:12:51.544 --> 00:12:54.942
than he is of ever going 
to jail for that crime.

00:12:56.002 --> 00:13:00.687
In South Asia, if you 
enslave a poor person,

00:13:00.687 --> 00:13:03.610
you're at greater risk of being 
struck by lightning

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.660
than ever being sent 
to jail for that crime.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.639
And so the epidemic of everyday 
violence, it just rages on.

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:15.738
And it devastates our efforts to try
to help billions of people

00:13:15.738 --> 00:13:19.315
out of their two-dollar-a-day hell.

00:13:19.315 --> 00:13:21.817
Because the data just doesn't lie.

00:13:21.817 --> 00:13:24.876
It turns out that you can give 
all manner of goods and services

00:13:24.876 --> 00:13:26.029
to the poor,

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:29.155
but if you don't restrain the hands 
of the violent bullies

00:13:29.155 --> 00:13:30.990
from taking it all away,

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.349
you're going to be very disappointed
in the long-term impact of your efforts.

00:13:35.889 --> 00:13:39.660
So you would think that the disintegration
of basic law enforcement

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.675
in the developing world
would be a huge priority

00:13:42.675 --> 00:13:45.915
for the global fight against poverty.

00:13:45.915 --> 00:13:48.048
But it's not.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:52.825
Auditors of international assistance
recently couldn't find

00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:56.659
even one percent of aid going 
to protect the poor

00:13:56.659 --> 00:14:00.990
from the lawless chaos 
of everyday violence.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.296
And honestly, when we do talk about 
violence against the poor,

00:14:04.296 --> 00:14:07.805
sometimes it's in the weirdest of ways.

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:10.888
A fresh water organization tells
a heart-wrenching story

00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:14.480
of girls who are raped on the way
to fetching water,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.290
and then celebrates
the solution of a new well

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.745
that drastically shortens their walk.

00:14:21.745 --> 00:14:23.953
End of story.

00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:30.353
But not a word about the rapists who
are still right there in the community.

00:14:31.813 --> 00:14:34.127
If a young woman on one 
of our college campuses

00:14:34.127 --> 00:14:37.273
was raped on her walk to the library, 


00:14:37.273 --> 00:14:43.121
we would never celebrate the solution
of moving the library closer to the dorm.

00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:47.112
And yet, for some reason,
this is okay for poor people.

00:14:48.915 --> 00:14:51.469
Now the truth is, the traditional experts

00:14:51.469 --> 00:14:53.775
in economic development
and poverty alleviation,

00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:56.035
they don't know how to fix this problem.

00:14:56.035 --> 00:14:57.856
And so what happens?

00:14:57.856 --> 00:14:59.947
They don't talk about it.

00:15:01.237 --> 00:15:05.408
But the more fundamental reason

00:15:05.408 --> 00:15:08.188
that law enforcement for the poor
in the developing world

00:15:08.188 --> 00:15:10.072
is so neglected,

00:15:10.072 --> 00:15:13.957
is because the people inside
the developing world, with money,

00:15:13.957 --> 00:15:16.075
don't need it.

00:15:17.165 --> 00:15:19.745
I was at the World Economic 
Forum not long ago

00:15:19.745 --> 00:15:23.689
talking to corporate executives who have
massive businesses in the developing world

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:25.771
and I was just asking them,

00:15:25.771 --> 00:15:31.325
"How do you guys protect all your people
and property from all the violence?"

00:15:31.325 --> 00:15:36.147
And they looked at each other, 
and they said, practically in unison,

00:15:36.147 --> 00:15:38.174
"We buy it."

00:15:39.474 --> 00:15:43.336
Indeed, private security forces 
in the developing world

00:15:43.336 --> 00:15:50.146
are now, four, five and seven times
larger than the public police force.

00:15:50.146 --> 00:15:57.608
In Africa, the largest employer 
on the continent now is private security.

00:15:58.884 --> 00:16:02.702
But see, the rich can pay for safety
and can keep getting richer,

00:16:02.702 --> 00:16:06.504
but the poor can't pay for it
and they're left totally unprotected

00:16:06.504 --> 00:16:09.074
and they keep getting thrown
to the ground.

00:16:10.464 --> 00:16:14.896
This is a massive and scandalous outrage.

00:16:14.896 --> 00:16:17.849
And it doesn't have to be this way.

00:16:17.849 --> 00:16:20.416
Broken law enforcement can be fixed.

00:16:20.416 --> 00:16:22.496
Violence can be stopped.

00:16:22.496 --> 00:16:24.888
Almost all criminal justice systems,


00:16:24.888 --> 00:16:27.417
they start out broken and corrupt,

00:16:27.417 --> 00:16:31.687
but they can be transformed
by fierce effort and commitment.

00:16:31.687 --> 00:16:33.930
The path forward is really pretty clear.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.377
Number one: We have to start making

00:16:37.377 --> 00:16:41.144
stopping violence indispensable 
to the fight against poverty.

00:16:41.144 --> 00:16:43.578
In fact, any conversation
about global poverty


00:16:43.578 --> 00:16:48.172
that doesn't include the problem 
of violence must be deemed not serious.

00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:53.792
And secondly, we have to begin 
to seriously invest resources

00:16:53.792 --> 00:16:57.729
and share expertise to support 
the developing world

00:16:57.729 --> 00:17:01.086
as they fashion new, 
public systems of justice,

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:02.652
not private security,

00:17:02.652 --> 00:17:05.299
that give everybody a chance to be safe.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:09.031
These transformations 
are actually possible

00:17:09.031 --> 00:17:11.640
and they're happening today.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.778
Recently, the Gates Foundation 
funded a project

00:17:14.778 --> 00:17:17.254
in the second largest city 
of the Philippines,

00:17:17.254 --> 00:17:20.260
where local advocates
and local law enforcement

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:27.118
were able to transform corrupt police
and broken courts so drastically,

00:17:27.118 --> 00:17:29.705
that in just four short years,

00:17:29.705 --> 00:17:32.177
they were able to measurably reduce

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:37.671
the commercial sexual violence 
against poor kids by 79 percent.

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:43.302
You know, from the hindsight of history,

00:17:43.302 --> 00:17:48.859
what's always most inexplicable
and inexcusable

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:52.080
are the simple failures of compassion.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.208
Because I think history convenes 
a tribunal of our grandchildren

00:17:58.208 --> 00:17:59.969
and they just ask us,

00:17:59.969 --> 00:18:03.211
"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you?

00:18:04.211 --> 00:18:07.766
Where were you, Grandpa, when 
the Jews were fleeing Nazi Germany

00:18:07.766 --> 00:18:09.695
and were being rejected from our shores?

00:18:09.695 --> 00:18:11.823
Where were you?

00:18:11.823 --> 00:18:14.223
And Grandma, where were you
when they were marching

00:18:14.223 --> 00:18:18.276
our Japanese-American neighbors
off to internment camps?

00:18:18.276 --> 00:18:20.665
And Grandpa, where were you 
when they were beating

00:18:20.665 --> 00:18:22.938
our African-American neighbors

00:18:22.938 --> 00:18:26.458
just because they were trying
to register to vote?"

00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:30.702
Likewise, when our grandchildren ask us,

00:18:30.702 --> 00:18:33.143
"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you

00:18:33.143 --> 00:18:37.636
when two billion of the world's poorest
were drowning in a lawless chaos

00:18:37.636 --> 00:18:40.337
of everyday violence?"

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:47.852
I hope we can say that we had compassion,
that we raised our voice,

00:18:47.852 --> 00:18:55.684
and as a generation, we were moved
to make the violence stop.

00:18:55.684 --> 00:18:58.141
Thank you very much.

00:18:58.141 --> 00:19:01.830
(Applause)

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.785
Chris Anderson: Really powerfully argued.

00:19:16.785 --> 00:19:19.064
Talk to us a bit about
some of the things

00:19:19.064 --> 00:19:25.588
that have actually been happening to,
for example, boost police training.

00:19:25.588 --> 00:19:27.427
How hard a process is that?

00:19:27.427 --> 00:19:31.009
GH: Well, one of the glorious 
things that's starting to happen now

00:19:31.009 --> 00:19:35.619
is that the collapse of these systems
and the consequences are becoming obvious.

00:19:35.619 --> 00:19:38.981
There's actually, now, 
political will to do that.

00:19:38.981 --> 00:19:43.106
But it just requires now an investment
of resources and transfer of expertise.

00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:46.509
There's a political will struggle 
that's going to take place as well,

00:19:46.509 --> 00:19:48.324
but those are winnable fights,

00:19:48.324 --> 00:19:50.623
because we've done some examples
around the world

00:19:50.623 --> 00:19:53.732
at International Justice Mission
that are very encouraging.

00:19:53.732 --> 00:19:57.233
CA: So just tell us in one country,
how much it costs

00:19:57.233 --> 00:20:00.748
to make a material difference 
to police, for example --

00:20:00.748 --> 00:20:02.538
I know that's only one piece of it.

00:20:02.538 --> 00:20:05.754
GH: In Guatemala, for instance,
we've started a project there

00:20:05.754 --> 00:20:09.006
with the local police 
and court system, prosecutors,

00:20:09.006 --> 00:20:12.819
to retrain them so that they can 
actually effectively bring these cases.

00:20:12.819 --> 00:20:17.131
And we've seen prosecutions against
perpetrators of sexual violence

00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:19.967
increase by more than 1,000 percent.

00:20:19.967 --> 00:20:24.356
This project has been very modestly funded
at about a million dollars a year,

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:26.662
and the kind of bang 
you can get for your buck

00:20:26.662 --> 00:20:30.838
in terms of leveraging
a criminal justice system

00:20:30.838 --> 00:20:35.595
that could function if it were properly
trained and motivated and led,

00:20:35.595 --> 00:20:38.138
and these countries, 
especially a middle class

00:20:38.138 --> 00:20:41.282
that is seeing that there's 
really no future

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:45.150
with this total instability and
total privatization of security

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.341
I think there's an opportunity,
a window for change.

00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:53.418
CA: But to make this happen, you have
to look at each part in the chain --

00:20:53.421 --> 00:20:55.676
the police, who else?

00:20:55.676 --> 00:20:57.957
GH: So that's the thing 
about law enforcement,

00:20:57.957 --> 00:20:59.400
it starts out with the police,

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.083
they're the front end
of the pipeline of justice,

00:21:02.083 --> 00:21:04.030
but they hand if off to the prosecutors,

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.265
and the prosecutors 
hand it off to the courts,

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:09.557
and the survivors of violence 
have to be supported by social services

00:21:09.557 --> 00:21:10.863
all the way through that.

00:21:10.863 --> 00:21:13.675
So you have to do an approach 
that pulls that all together.

00:21:13.675 --> 00:21:16.726
In the past, there's been a little bit
of training of the courts,

00:21:16.726 --> 00:21:18.900
but they get crappy evidence 
from the police,

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.537
or a little police intervention 
that has to do with narcotics or terrorism

00:21:22.537 --> 00:21:25.405
but nothing to do with treating
the common poor person

00:21:25.405 --> 00:21:26.924
with excellent law enforcement,

00:21:26.924 --> 00:21:28.949
so it's about pulling that all together,

00:21:28.949 --> 00:21:32.091
and you can actually have people
in very poor communities

00:21:32.091 --> 00:21:34.274
experience law enforcement like us,

00:21:34.274 --> 00:21:37.096
which is imperfect in our 
own experience, for sure,

00:21:37.096 --> 00:21:40.228
but boy, is it a great thing to sense
that you can call 911

00:21:40.228 --> 00:21:43.264
and maybe someone will protect you.

00:21:43.264 --> 00:21:45.537
CA: Gary, I think you've done 
a spectacular job

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:47.664
of bringing this to the world's attention

00:21:47.664 --> 00:21:49.411
in your book and right here today.

00:21:49.411 --> 00:21:50.505
Thanks so much.

00:21:50.505 --> 00:21:51.281
Gary Haugen.

00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:53.114
