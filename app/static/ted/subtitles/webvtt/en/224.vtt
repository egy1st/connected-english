Roy Gould: Less than a year from now,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which marks the 400th anniversary

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In a few months, the world is also going to celebrate

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which I think is going to have as profound an impact

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's called the WorldWide Telescope,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I want to urge you, when you get a chance,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The WorldWide Telescope takes the best images

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
from the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and has woven them seamlessly

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to produce a holistic view of the universe.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's going to change the way we do astronomy,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
it's going to change the way we teach astronomy

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and I think most importantly

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that might not be so big a claim.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
In 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
if you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote;

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
what you saw was thought to be the entire universe.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
In fact, the head of Harvard's observatory back then

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
gave a great debate in which he argued

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Harvard was wrong, big time. (Laughter)

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Of course, we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
all the way back in time,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We can see across the entire spectrum of light,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
revealing worlds that had previously been invisible.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We see these magnificent star nurseries,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We see alien worlds, we see alien solar systems --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
300 now, and still counting --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and they're not like us.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
in the Milky Way, and elsewhere in the universe,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
where time itself seems to stand still.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
But until now, our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
have fallen through the cracks. And that's changing.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I want to just briefly mention three reasons

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
why my colleagues and I, in astronomy and in education,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and why we think it's truly transformative.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
First, it enables you to experience the universe:

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the WorldWide Telescope, for me, is a kind of magic carpet

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Second: you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
who can share their enthusiasm

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and can make the universe a welcoming place.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And third, you can create your own tours --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
you can share them with friends, you can create them with friends --

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and that's the part that I think I'm most excited about

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
because I think that at heart, we are all storytellers.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And in telling stories,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We're going to have a personal universe.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I just want to leave you with this brief thought:

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
when I ask people, "How does the night sky make you feel?"

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
they often say, "Oh, tiny. I feel tiny and insignificant."

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Well, our gaze fills the universe.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that we may be tiny, but we are truly, wonderfully significant.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Thank you.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
(Applause)

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I can't tell you what a privilege it is

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft. (Applause)

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Curtis Wong: Thank you, Roy.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So, what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
but it's one of the tours.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And actually this tour is one that was created earlier.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And the tours are all totally interactive,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
so that if I were to go somewhere ...

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
pull up other information --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
there are lots of Web and information sources

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
about places you might want to go --

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
you can zoom in, you can pull back out.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The whole resources are there available for you.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So, Microsoft -- this is a project that -- WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
who's our colleague, and a lot of his work that he did

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
is really what makes this project possible.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
It's a labor of love for us and our small team,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So basically, kids of all ages, like us.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
It'll be a free download -- thank you, Craig Mundie --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope.org,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
which is something new.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And so, what you've seen today

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and in the TED Lab, we have a tour

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that will knock your socks off. (Laughter)

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So we'll see you there. Thank you.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
(Applause)
