WEBVTT

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.292
I am a plant geneticist.

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:06.867
I study genes that make plants
resistant to disease

00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:09.189
and tolerant of stress.

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:11.465
In recent years,

00:00:11.465 --> 00:00:14.367
millions of people around the world
have come to believe

00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:18.500
that there's something sinister
about genetic modification.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.003
Today, I am going to provide
a different perspective.

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.569
First, let me introduce my husband, Raoul.

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.192
He's an organic farmer.

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:33.140
On his farm, he plants
a variety of different crops.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.181
This is one of the many
ecological farming practices

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.664
he uses to keep his farm healthy.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:42.822
Imagine some of the reactions we get:

00:00:42.822 --> 00:00:46.398
"Really? An organic farmer
and a plant geneticist?

00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:49.439
Can you agree on anything?"

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:54.415
Well, we can, and it's not difficult,
because we have the same goal.

00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:57.543
We want to help nourish
the growing population

00:00:57.543 --> 00:01:00.283
without further destroying
the environment.

00:01:00.283 --> 00:01:05.066
I believe this is the greatest
challenge of our time.

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:09.199
Now, genetic modification is not new;

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:13.169
virtually everything we eat
has been genetically modified

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:15.264
in some manner.

00:01:15.264 --> 00:01:18.376
Let me give you a few examples.

00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:20.657
On the left is an image

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:25.208
of the ancient ancestor of modern corn.

00:01:25.208 --> 00:01:29.109
You see a single roll of grain
that's covered in a hard case.

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.640
Unless you have a hammer,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.655
teosinte isn't good for making tortillas.

00:01:36.655 --> 00:01:41.310
Now, take a look at
the ancient ancestor of banana.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.064
You can see the large seeds.

00:01:43.064 --> 00:01:46.500
And unappetizing brussel sprouts,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.122
and eggplant, so beautiful.

00:01:50.122 --> 00:01:52.305
Now, to create these varieties,

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:55.489
breeders have used many different
genetic techniques over the years.

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:57.053
Some of them are quite creative,

00:01:57.053 --> 00:01:59.607
like mixing two different species together

00:01:59.607 --> 00:02:01.720
using a process called grafting

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.522
to create this variety
that's half tomato and half potato.

00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:12.076
Breeders have also used
other types of genetic techniques,

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:14.119
such as random mutagenesis,

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:17.509
which induces uncharacterized mutations

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.808
into the plants.

00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:24.134
The rice in the cereal
that many of us fed our babies

00:02:24.134 --> 00:02:27.957
was developed using this approach.

00:02:27.957 --> 00:02:31.626
Now, today, breeders have
even more options to choose from.

00:02:31.626 --> 00:02:35.364
Some of them are extraordinarily precise.

00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:39.172
I want to give you a couple examples
from my own work.

00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:45.047
I work on rice, which is a staple food
for more than half the world's people.

00:02:45.047 --> 00:02:48.181
Each year, 40 percent
of the potential harvest

00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:51.037
is lost to pest and disease.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:54.167
For this reason,
farmers plant rice varieties

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:57.023
that carry genes for resistance.

00:02:57.023 --> 00:03:00.761
This approach has been used
for nearly 100 years.

00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.942
Yet, when I started graduate school,

00:03:03.942 --> 00:03:06.195
no one knew what these genes were.

00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:11.280
It wasn't until the 1990s
that scientists finally uncovered

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.414
the genetic basis of resistance.

00:03:14.414 --> 00:03:19.174
In my laboratory, we isolated a gene
for immunity to a very serious

00:03:19.174 --> 00:03:21.937
bacterial disease in Asia and Africa.

00:03:21.937 --> 00:03:27.277
We found we could engineer the gene
into a conventional rice variety

00:03:27.277 --> 00:03:29.088
that's normally susceptible,

00:03:29.088 --> 00:03:31.526
and you can see the two leaves
on the bottom here

00:03:31.526 --> 00:03:34.499
are highly resistant to infection.

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.888
Now, the same month
that my laboratory published

00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:40.675
our discovery on the rice immunity gene,

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:44.274
my friend and colleague Dave Mackill
stopped by my office.

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:51.794
He said, "Seventy million rice farmers
are having trouble growing rice."

00:03:52.864 --> 00:03:55.651
That's because their fields are flooded,

00:03:55.651 --> 00:04:00.272
and these rice farmers are living
on less than two dollars a day.

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:03.824
Although rice grows well
in standing water,

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:06.634
most rice varieties will die
if they're submerged

00:04:06.634 --> 00:04:08.932
for more than three days.

00:04:08.932 --> 00:04:12.253
Flooding is expected
to be increasingly problematic

00:04:12.253 --> 00:04:15.062
as the climate changes.

00:04:15.062 --> 00:04:19.497
He told me that his graduate student
Kenong Xu and himself

00:04:19.497 --> 00:04:24.466
were studying an ancient variety of rice
that had an amazing property.

00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:30.178
It could withstand two weeks
of complete submergence.

00:04:30.178 --> 00:04:35.448
He asked if I would be willing
to help them isolate this gene.

00:04:35.448 --> 00:04:39.999
I said yes -- I was very excited,
because I knew if we were successful,

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.993
we could potentially help
millions of farmers grow rice

00:04:43.993 --> 00:04:47.453
even when their fields were flooded.

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:51.516
Kenong spent 10 years
looking for this gene.

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:53.513
Then one day, he said,

00:04:53.513 --> 00:04:57.135
"Come look at this experiment.
You've got to see it."

00:04:57.135 --> 00:04:58.992
I went to the greenhouse and I saw

00:04:58.992 --> 00:05:04.292
that the conventional variety
that was flooded for 18 days had died,

00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:07.955
but the rice variety that we
had genetically engineered

00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:12.459
with a new gene we had discovered,
called Sub1, was alive.

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:14.944
Kenong and I were amazed and excited

00:05:14.944 --> 00:05:18.775
that a single gene could have
this dramatic effect.

00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:22.417
But this is just a greenhouse experiment.

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:25.783
Would this work in the field?

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:28.523
Now, I'm going to show you
a four-month time lapse video

00:05:28.523 --> 00:05:31.565
taken at the International
Rice Research Institute.

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:36.590
Breeders there developed
a rice variety carrying the Sub1 gene

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.226
using another genetic technique
called precision breeding.

00:05:40.226 --> 00:05:42.826
On the left, you can see the Sub1 variety,

00:05:42.826 --> 00:05:46.471
and on the right
is the conventional variety.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.933
Both varieties do very well at first,

00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:52.346
but then the field is flooded for 17 days.

00:05:52.346 --> 00:05:55.271
You can see the Sub1 variety does great.

00:05:55.271 --> 00:06:00.124
In fact, it produces
three and a half times more grain

00:06:00.124 --> 00:06:03.468
than the conventional variety.

00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:05.465
I love this video

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:09.760
because it shows the power
of plant genetics to help farmers.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.150
Last year, with the help
of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.260
three and a half million farmers
grew Sub1 rice.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.439
(Applause)

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:24.388
Thank you.

00:06:25.168 --> 00:06:29.310
Now, many people don't mind
genetic modification

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.050
when it comes to moving rice genes around,

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.397
rice genes in rice plants,

00:06:33.397 --> 00:06:36.787
or even when it comes
to mixing species together

00:06:36.787 --> 00:06:41.036
through grafting or random mutagenesis.

00:06:41.036 --> 00:06:46.214
But when it comes to taking genes
from viruses and bacteria

00:06:46.214 --> 00:06:48.002
and putting them into plants,

00:06:48.002 --> 00:06:51.299
a lot of people say, "Yuck."

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:53.458
Why would you do that?

00:06:53.458 --> 00:06:56.221
The reason is that sometimes
it's the cheapest, safest,

00:06:56.221 --> 00:06:59.333
and most effective technology

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:04.627
for enhancing food security
and advancing sustainable agriculture.

00:07:04.627 --> 00:07:07.668
I'm going to give you three examples.

00:07:07.668 --> 00:07:10.780
First, take a look at papaya.
It's delicious, right?

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.287
But now, look at this papaya.

00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:17.490
This papaya is infected
with papaya ringspot virus.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:23.248
In the 1950s, this virus
nearly wiped out the entire production

00:07:23.248 --> 00:07:29.169
of papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:33.465
Many people thought
that the Hawaiian papaya was doomed,

00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:36.529
but then, a local Hawaiian,

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:39.200
a plant pathologist
named Dennis Gonsalves,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.631
decided to try to fight this disease
using genetic engineering.

00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:47.299
He took a snippet of viral DNA
and he inserted it

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:49.412
into the papaya genome.

00:07:49.412 --> 00:07:52.686
This is kind of like a human
getting a vaccination.

00:07:52.686 --> 00:07:55.217
Now, take a look at his field trial.

00:07:55.217 --> 00:07:58.839
You can see the genetically
engineered papaya in the center.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:01.022
It's immune to infection.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:06.650
The conventional papaya around the outside
is severely infected with the virus.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:13.369
Dennis' pioneering work is credited
with rescuing the papaya industry.

00:08:13.369 --> 00:08:18.134
Today, 20 years later, there's still no
other method to control this disease.

00:08:18.134 --> 00:08:21.338
There's no organic method.
There's no conventional method.

00:08:21.338 --> 00:08:25.588
Eighty percent of Hawaiian papaya
is genetically engineered.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:30.463
Now, some of you may still feel a little
queasy about viral genes in your food,

00:08:30.463 --> 00:08:32.600
but consider this:

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:39.380
The genetically engineered papaya
carries just a trace amount of the virus.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.770
If you bite into an organic
or conventional papaya

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.625
that is infected with the virus,

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:50.641
you will be chewing on tenfold
more viral protein.

00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:54.593
Now, take a look at this pest
feasting on an eggplant.

00:08:54.593 --> 00:08:56.980
The brown you see is frass,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.161
what comes out
the back end of the insect.

00:09:00.161 --> 00:09:03.365
To control this serious pest,

00:09:03.365 --> 00:09:08.891
which can devastate the entire
eggplant crop in Bangladesh,

00:09:08.891 --> 00:09:12.327
Bangladeshi farmers spray insecticides

00:09:12.327 --> 00:09:15.694
two to three times a week,

00:09:15.694 --> 00:09:20.408
sometimes twice a day,
when pest pressure is high.

00:09:20.408 --> 00:09:24.448
But we know that some insecticides
are very harmful to human health,

00:09:24.448 --> 00:09:28.035
especially when farmers and their families

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:32.400
cannot afford proper protection,
like these children.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.903
In less developed countries,
it's estimated that 300,000 people

00:09:37.903 --> 00:09:43.313
die every year because of
insecticide misuse and exposure.

00:09:43.313 --> 00:09:47.121
Cornell and Bangladeshi scientists
decided to fight this disease

00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:52.373
using a genetic technique that builds
on an organic farming approach.

00:09:52.373 --> 00:09:57.263
Organic farmers like my husband Raoul
spray an insecticide called B.T.,

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.239
which is based on a bacteria.

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:06.067
This pesticide is very specific
to caterpillar pests,

00:10:06.067 --> 00:10:09.643
and in fact, it's nontoxic
to humans, fish and birds.

00:10:09.643 --> 00:10:12.754
It's less toxic than table salt.

00:10:12.754 --> 00:10:15.332
But this approach
does not work well in Bangladesh.

00:10:15.332 --> 00:10:17.746
That's because these insecticide sprays

00:10:17.746 --> 00:10:19.999
are difficult to find, they're expensive,

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:24.341
and they don't prevent the insect
from getting inside the plants.

00:10:24.341 --> 00:10:27.545
In the genetic approach, scientists
cut the gene out of the bacteria

00:10:27.545 --> 00:10:30.726
and insert it directly into
the eggplant genome.

00:10:30.726 --> 00:10:34.116
Will this work to reduce
insecticide sprays in Bangladesh?

00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:35.555
Definitely.

00:10:35.555 --> 00:10:40.106
Last season, farmers reported they were
able to reduce their insecticide use

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:44.471
by a huge amount, almost down to zero.

00:10:44.471 --> 00:10:47.560
They're able to harvest
and replant for the next season.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.505
Now, I've given you a couple examples
of how genetic engineering can be used

00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:54.293
to fight pests and disease

00:10:54.293 --> 00:10:57.033
and to reduce the amount of insecticides.

00:10:57.033 --> 00:11:00.400
My final example is an example

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.514
where genetic engineering
can be used to reduce malnutrition.

00:11:06.024 --> 00:11:08.573
In less developed countries,

00:11:08.573 --> 00:11:13.239
500,000 children go blind every year
because of lack of Vitamin A.

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:16.004
More than half will die.

00:11:16.004 --> 00:11:19.857
For this reason, scientists supported
by the Rockefeller Foundation

00:11:19.857 --> 00:11:22.713
genetically engineered a golden rice

00:11:22.713 --> 00:11:27.264
to produce beta-carotene,
which is the precursor of Vitamin A.

00:11:27.264 --> 00:11:30.589
This is the same pigment
that we find in carrots.

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:35.321
Researchers estimate that just one cup
of golden rice per day

00:11:35.321 --> 00:11:39.748
will save the lives
of thousands of children.

00:11:39.748 --> 00:11:41.958
But golden rice is virulently opposed

00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.918
by activists who are
against genetic modification.

00:11:44.918 --> 00:11:46.528
Just last year,

00:11:46.528 --> 00:11:50.923
activists invaded and destroyed
a field trial in the Philippines.

00:11:50.923 --> 00:11:53.339
When I heard about the destruction,

00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:57.100
I wondered if they knew that they
were destroying much more

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.283
than a scientific research project,

00:11:59.283 --> 00:12:02.504
that they were destroying medicines
that children desperately needed

00:12:02.504 --> 00:12:05.967
to save their sight and their lives.

00:12:05.967 --> 00:12:08.710
Some of my friends and family still worry:

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.961
How do you know genes
in the food are safe to eat?

00:12:11.961 --> 00:12:13.679
I explained the genetic engineering,

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:16.047
the process of moving
genes between species,

00:12:16.047 --> 00:12:18.857
has been used for more than 40 years

00:12:18.857 --> 00:12:23.172
in wines, in medicine,
in plants, in cheeses.

00:12:23.172 --> 00:12:26.296
In all that time, there hasn't been
a single case of harm

00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:30.164
to human health or the environment.

00:12:30.164 --> 00:12:32.835
But I say, look, I'm not
asking you to believe me.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:36.062
Science is not a belief system.

00:12:36.062 --> 00:12:38.871
My opinion doesn't matter.

00:12:38.871 --> 00:12:41.681
Let's look at the evidence.

00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:45.187
After 20 years of careful study
and rigorous peer review

00:12:45.187 --> 00:12:48.229
by thousands of independent scientists,

00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:52.269
every major scientific organization
in the world has concluded

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:55.891
that the crops currently
on the market are safe to eat

00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:58.143
and that the process
of genetic engineering

00:12:58.143 --> 00:13:02.996
is no more risky than older methods
of genetic modification.

00:13:02.996 --> 00:13:06.632
These are precisely the same
organizations that most of us trust

00:13:06.632 --> 00:13:09.656
when it comes to other
important scientific issues

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:13.681
such as global climate change
or the safety of vaccines.

00:13:15.081 --> 00:13:19.500
Raoul and I believe that, instead of
worrying about the genes in our food,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.192
we must focus on how we can help
children grow up healthy.

00:13:23.192 --> 00:13:26.327
We must ask if farmers
in rural communities can thrive,

00:13:26.327 --> 00:13:28.951
and if everyone can afford the food.

00:13:28.951 --> 00:13:32.642
We must try to minimize
environmental degradation.

00:13:32.642 --> 00:13:36.241
What scares me most about
the loud arguments and misinformation

00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:37.797
about plant genetics

00:13:37.797 --> 00:13:40.839
is that the poorest people
who most need the technology

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:44.577
may be denied access because of
the vague fears and prejudices

00:13:44.577 --> 00:13:47.804
of those who have enough to eat.

00:13:47.804 --> 00:13:50.730
We have a huge challenge in front of us.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.515
Let's celebrate scientific
innovation and use it.

00:13:54.515 --> 00:13:56.465
It's our responsibility

00:13:56.465 --> 00:13:59.902
to do everything we can to help
alleviate human suffering

00:13:59.902 --> 00:14:01.736
and safeguard the environment.

00:14:01.736 --> 00:14:03.988
Thank you.

00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:05.915
(Applause)

00:14:05.915 --> 00:14:08.493
Thank you.

00:14:08.493 --> 00:14:10.397
Chris Anderson: Powerfully argued.

00:14:10.397 --> 00:14:12.556
The people who argue against GMOs,

00:14:12.556 --> 00:14:16.387
as I understand it, the core piece
comes from two things.

00:14:16.387 --> 00:14:19.277
One, complexity and
unintended consequence.

00:14:19.277 --> 00:14:21.318
Nature is this incredibly complex machine.

00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:23.902
If we put out these brand new genes
that we've created,

00:14:23.902 --> 00:14:26.326
that haven't been challenged
by years of evolution,

00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:29.233
and they started mixing up
with the rest of what's going on,

00:14:29.233 --> 00:14:32.670
couldn't that trigger some kind
of cataclysm or problem,

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.241
especially when you add in
the commercial incentive

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:38.794
that some companies have
to put them out there?

00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:40.512
The fear is that those incentives

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:44.246
mean that the decision is not made
on purely scientific grounds,

00:14:44.246 --> 00:14:47.292
and even if it was, that there would be
unintended consequences.

00:14:47.292 --> 00:14:51.425
How do we know that there isn't
a big risk of some unintended consequence?

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:55.302
Often our tinkerings with nature
do lead to big, unintended consequences

00:14:55.302 --> 00:14:56.997
and chain reactions.

00:14:56.997 --> 00:14:59.575
Pamela Ronald: Okay,
so on the commercial aspects,

00:14:59.575 --> 00:15:02.245
one thing that's really important
to understand is that,

00:15:02.245 --> 00:15:04.911
in the developed world,
farmers in the United States,

00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:07.732
almost all farmers, whether
they're organic or conventional,

00:15:07.732 --> 00:15:09.830
they buy seed produced by seed companies.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.932
So there's definitely a commercial
interest to sell a lot of seed,

00:15:12.932 --> 00:15:15.935
but hopefully they're selling seed
that the farmers want to buy.

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:18.196
It's different in the
less developed world.

00:15:18.196 --> 00:15:20.309
Farmers there cannot afford the seed.

00:15:20.309 --> 00:15:21.935
These seeds are not being sold.

00:15:21.935 --> 00:15:24.303
These seeds are being distributed freely

00:15:24.303 --> 00:15:29.365
through traditional kinds
of certification groups,

00:15:29.365 --> 00:15:31.848
so it is very important
in less developed countries

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:33.473
that the seed be freely available.

00:15:33.473 --> 00:15:37.097
CA: Wouldn't some activists say that this
is actually part of the conspiracy?

00:15:37.097 --> 00:15:38.513
This is the heroin strategy.

00:15:38.513 --> 00:15:40.765
You seed the stuff,
and people have no choice

00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:42.704
but to be hooked on these seeds forever?

00:15:42.704 --> 00:15:48.091
PR: There are a lot of conspiracy theories
for sure, but it doesn't work that way.

00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:52.067
For example, the seed that's being
distributed, the flood-tolerant rice,

00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:53.912
this is distributed freely

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:58.029
through Indian and Bangladeshi
seed certification agencies,

00:15:58.029 --> 00:16:00.444
so there's no commercial interest at all.

00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:04.368
The golden rice was developed through
support of the Rockefeller Foundation.

00:16:04.368 --> 00:16:06.365
Again, it's being freely distributed.

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:08.152
There are no commercial profits

00:16:08.152 --> 00:16:10.498
in this situation.

00:16:10.498 --> 00:16:13.771
And now to address your other question
about, well, mixing genes,

00:16:13.771 --> 00:16:16.024
aren't there some unintended consequences?

00:16:16.024 --> 00:16:19.019
Absolutely -- every time
we do something different,

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:20.800
there's an unintended consequence,

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.827
but one of the points I was trying to make

00:16:22.827 --> 00:16:26.159
is that we've been doing
kind of crazy things to our plants,

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:30.257
mutagenesis using radiation
or chemical mutagenesis.

00:16:30.257 --> 00:16:34.204
This induces thousands
of uncharacterized mutations,

00:16:34.204 --> 00:16:38.128
and this is even a higher risk
of unintended consequence

00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:39.916
than many of the modern methods.

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:43.051
And so it's really important
not to use the term GMO

00:16:43.051 --> 00:16:45.767
because it's scientifically meaningless.

00:16:45.767 --> 00:16:50.109
I feel it's very important to talk
about a specific crop

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:53.431
and a specific product, and think about
the needs of the consumer.

00:16:53.431 --> 00:16:56.608
CA: So part of what's happening here
is that there's a mental model

00:16:56.608 --> 00:17:00.460
in a lot of people that nature is nature,
and it's pure and pristine,

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.697
and to tinker with it is Frankensteinian.

00:17:02.697 --> 00:17:06.343
It's making something that's pure
dangerous in some way,

00:17:06.343 --> 00:17:08.684
and I think you're saying
that that whole model

00:17:08.684 --> 00:17:10.797
just misunderstands how nature is.

00:17:10.797 --> 00:17:14.698
Nature is a much more chaotic
interplay of genetic changes

00:17:14.698 --> 00:17:16.927
that have been happening
all the time anyway.

00:17:16.927 --> 00:17:20.340
PR: That's absolutely true, and there's
no such thing as pure food.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.397
I mean, you could not spray
eggplant with insecticides

00:17:23.397 --> 00:17:26.920
or not genetically engineer it,
but then you'd be stuck eating frass.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.148
So there's no purity there.

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.748
CA: Pam Ronald, thank you. 
That was powerfully argued.

00:17:31.748 --> 00:17:33.838
PR: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

00:17:33.838 --> 00:17:35.990
(Applause)
