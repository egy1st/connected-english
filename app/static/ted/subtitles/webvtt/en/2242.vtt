00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:02.629
Isadora Duncan --

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.527
(Music) --

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:09.650
crazy, long-legged woman
from San Francisco,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.369
got tired of this country,
and she wanted to get out.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.934
Isadora was famous
somewhere around 1908

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:25.299
for putting up a blue curtain,

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:27.504
and she would stand

00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:30.753
with her hands over her solar plexus

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.981
and she would wait,

00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:37.271
and she would wait,

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:41.450
and then, she would move.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.371
(Music)

00:01:09.856 --> 00:01:15.527
Josh and I and Somi call this piece

00:01:15.527 --> 00:01:20.424
"The Red Circle and the Blue Curtain."

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:27.508
Red circle.

00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:31.356
Blue curtain.

00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:33.629
But,

00:01:39.397 --> 00:01:43.372
this is not the beginning
of the 20th century.

00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:48.240
This is a morning in Vancouver

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.614
in 2015.

00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:57.603
(Music)

00:02:22.404 --> 00:02:30.154
(Singing)

00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:16.365
Come on, Josh!

00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:21.530
(Music)

00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:43.092
(Singing)

00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.432
Go!

00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:15.140
Are we there yet?

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.340
I don't think so.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.449
Hey, yeah!

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.975
(Music)

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:39.756
What time is it?

00:04:39.756 --> 00:04:41.428
(Music)

00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:44.111
Where are we?

00:04:47.178 --> 00:04:49.140
Josh.

00:04:51.775 --> 00:04:54.251
Somi.

00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:56.587
Bill T.

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:58.805
Josh.

00:05:01.315 --> 00:05:03.962
Somi.

00:05:06.185 --> 00:05:09.788
Bill T.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.914
(Applause)

00:06:08.457 --> 00:06:12.457
Yeah, yeah!
