00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:02.533
You may not realize this,

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:07.413
but there are more bacteria in your body
than stars in our entire galaxy.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.167
This fascinating universe
of bacteria inside of us

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:13.443
is an integral part of our health,

00:00:13.443 --> 00:00:15.532
and our technology is evolving so rapidly

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:20.291
that today we can program these bacteria
like we program computers.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.939
Now, the diagram that you see here,

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.470
I know it looks like
some kind of sports play,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.626
but it is actually a blueprint of
the first bacterial program I developed.

00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:32.947
And like writing software,
we can print and write DNA

00:00:32.947 --> 00:00:36.174
into different algorithms
and programs inside of bacteria.

00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:39.519
What this program does
is produces fluorescent proteins

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:40.957
in a rhythmic fashion

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.559
and generates a small molecule

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.137
that allows bacteria
to communicate and synchronize,

00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:46.975
as you're seeing in this movie.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.785
The growing colony of bacteria
that you see here

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:51.778
is about the width of a human hair.

00:00:51.778 --> 00:00:54.285
Now, what you can't see
is that our genetic program

00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:57.768
instructs these bacteria
to each produce small molecules,

00:00:57.768 --> 00:01:01.181
and these molecules travel between
the thousands of individual bacteria

00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:03.897
telling them when to turn on and off.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:07.148
And the bacteria synchronize
quite well at this scale,

00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:11.142
but because the molecule that synchronizes
them together can only travel so fast,

00:01:11.142 --> 00:01:14.718
in larger colonies of bacteria,
this results in traveling waves

00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:17.620
between bacteria that are
far away from each other,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.356
and you can see these waves going
from right to left across the screen.

00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:24.144
Now, our genetic program
relies on a natural phenomenon

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:25.317
called quorum sensing,

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:28.649
in which bacteria trigger coordinated
and sometimes virulent behaviors

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.590
once they reach a critical density.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.245
You can observe quorum sensing
in action in this movie,

00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:37.887
where a growing colony of bacteria
only begins to glow

00:01:37.887 --> 00:01:40.258
once it reaches a high
or critical density.

00:01:40.258 --> 00:01:42.100
Our genetic program

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.251
continues producing these
rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins

00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:47.619
as the colony grows outwards.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.310
This particular movie and experiment
we call The Supernova,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.340
because it looks like an exploding star.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.730
Now, besides programming
these beautiful patterns,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.321
I wondered, what else can we get
these bacteria to do?

00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:01.900
And I decided to explore
how we can program bacteria

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.689
to detect and treat diseases
in our bodies like cancer.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.307
One of the surprising facts about bacteria

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:11.744
is that they can naturally grow
inside of tumors.

00:02:11.744 --> 00:02:13.508
This happens because typically tumors

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.923
are areas where the immune system
has no access,

00:02:15.923 --> 00:02:17.920
and so bacteria find these tumors

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.751
and use them as a safe haven
to grow and thrive.

00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:23.585
We started using probiotic bacteria

00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:26.209
which are safe bacteria
that have a health benefit,

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.670
and found that
when orally delivered to mice,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.826
these probiotics would selectively
grow inside of liver tumors.

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:34.780
We realized that the most convenient way

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.861
to highlight the presence
of the probiotics,

00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:38.724
and hence, the presence of the tumors,

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:40.953
was to get these bacteria
to produce a signal

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:43.069
that would be detectable in the urine,

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.481
and so we specifically
programmed these probiotics

00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.360
to make a molecule that would change
the color of your urine

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.170
to indicate the presence of cancer.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.180
We went on to show that this technology

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.370
could sensitively and specifically
detect liver cancer,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.060
one that is challenging
to detect otherwise.

00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:02.890
Now, since these bacteria
specifically localize to tumors,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.478
we've been programming them
to not only detect cancer

00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:07.266
but also to treat cancer

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:10.493
by producing therapeutic molecules
from within the tumor environment

00:03:10.493 --> 00:03:12.815
that shrink the existing tumors,

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:15.570
and we've been doing this
using quorum sensing programs

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.413
like you saw in the previous movies.

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:21.110
Altogether, imagine in the future
taking a programmed probiotic

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.589
that could detect and treat cancer,

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.170
or even other diseases.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.604
Our ability to program bacteria

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:30.299
and program life

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.248
opens up new horizons in cancer research,

00:03:33.248 --> 00:03:35.983
and to share this vision,
I worked with artist Vik Muniz

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:37.799
to create the symbol of the universe,

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.440
made entirely out of bacteria
or cancer cells.

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:46.645
Ultimately, my hope is that the beauty
and purpose of this microscopic universe

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:51.544
can inspire new and creative approaches
for the future of cancer research.

00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:54.168
Thank you.

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:57.934
(Applause)
