00:00:01.056 --> 00:00:04.971
On the path that American children 
travel to adulthood,

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:08.519
two institutions oversee the journey.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.262
The first is the one we hear 
a lot about: college.

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.845
Some of you may remember
the excitement that you felt

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:17.431
when you first set off for college.

00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:19.983
Some of you may be in college right now

00:00:19.983 --> 00:00:22.998
and you're feeling this excitement
at this very moment.

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:25.667
College has some shortcomings.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:29.003
It's expensive; it leaves
young people in debt.

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.947
But all in all, it's a pretty good path.

00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:37.114
Young people emerge from college
with pride and with great friends

00:00:37.114 --> 00:00:39.453
and with a lot of knowledge 
about the world.

00:00:39.453 --> 00:00:41.289
And perhaps most importantly,

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.795
a better chance in the labor market
than they had before they got there.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.498
Today I want to talk about
the second institution

00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:54.056
overseeing the journey from childhood
to adulthood in the United States.

00:00:54.056 --> 00:00:57.811
And that institution is prison.

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.536
Young people on this journey
are meeting with probation officers

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:04.939
instead of with teachers.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.832
They're going to court dates
instead of to class.

00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:13.909
Their junior year abroad is instead
a trip to a state correctional facility.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.599
And they're emerging from their 20s

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.796
not with degrees in business and English,

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:21.814
but with criminal records.

00:01:22.514 --> 00:01:25.107
This institution is also costing us a lot,

00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:26.749
about 40,000 dollars a year

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:30.517
to send a young person
to prison in New Jersey.

00:01:31.167 --> 00:01:33.723
But here, taxpayers are footing the bill

00:01:33.723 --> 00:01:37.206
and what kids are getting
is a cold prison cell

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:40.016
and a permanent mark against them
when they come home

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:42.765
and apply for work.

00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:46.211
There are more and more kids
on this journey to adulthood

00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:51.435
than ever before in the United States
and that's because in the past 40 years,

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:57.187
our incarceration rate 
has grown by 700 percent.

00:01:57.187 --> 00:01:59.316
I have one slide for this talk.

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:00.570
Here it is.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.623
Here's our incarceration rate,

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:09.915
about 716 people per 100,000
in the population.

00:02:11.205 --> 00:02:14.065
Here's the OECD countries.

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:21.617
What's more, it's poor kids
that we're sending to prison,

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:25.105
too many drawn from African-American
and Latino communities

00:02:25.105 --> 00:02:29.986
so that prison now stands firmly between
the young people trying to make it

00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:33.418
and the fulfillment of the American Dream.

00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:36.274
The problem's actually 
a bit worse than this

00:02:36.274 --> 00:02:38.952
'cause we're not just sending 
poor kids to prison,

00:02:38.952 --> 00:02:41.919
we're saddling poor kids with court fees,

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.240
with probation and parole restrictions,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.127
with low-level warrants,

00:02:46.127 --> 00:02:49.622
we're asking them to live 
in halfway houses and on house arrest,

00:02:49.622 --> 00:02:53.227
and we're asking them 
to negotiate a police force

00:02:53.227 --> 00:02:55.640
that is entering poor
communities of color,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.839
not for the purposes 
of promoting public safety,

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:03.315
but to make arrest counts,
to line city coffers.

00:03:06.537 --> 00:03:10.925
This is the hidden underside to our
historic experiment in punishment:

00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:15.971
young people worried that at any moment,
they will be stopped, searched and seized.

00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:19.258
Not just in the streets, 
but in their homes,

00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:21.695
at school and at work.

00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:26.116
I got interested in this 
other path to adulthood

00:03:26.116 --> 00:03:28.357
when I was myself a college student

00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:30.415
attending the University of Pennsylvania

00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:32.493
in the early 2000s.

00:03:32.493 --> 00:03:36.060
Penn sits within a historic 
African-American neighborhood.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.298
So you've got these two parallel
journeys going on simultaneously:

00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:44.419
the kids attending 
this elite, private university,

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.885
and the kids from 
the adjacent neighborhood,

00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:48.813
some of whom are making it to college,

00:03:48.813 --> 00:03:52.311
and many of whom 
are being shipped to prison.

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:57.415
In my sophomore year, I started tutoring
a young woman who was in high school

00:03:57.415 --> 00:04:00.409
who lived about 10 minutes
away from the university.

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.942
Soon, her cousin came home 
from a juvenile detention center.

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:06.600
He was 15, a freshman in high school.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.259
I began to get to know him 
and his friends and family,

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.611
and I asked him what he thought 
about me writing about his life

00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:16.196
for my senior thesis in college.

00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:20.387
This senior thesis became
a dissertation at Princeton

00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:21.935
and now a book.

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:23.533
By the end of my sophomore year,

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:26.903
I moved into the neighborhood
and I spent the next six years

00:04:26.903 --> 00:04:31.494
trying to understand what young people
were facing as they came of age.

00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:34.318
The first week I spent
in this neighborhood,

00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:36.894
I saw two boys, five and seven years old,

00:04:36.894 --> 00:04:38.386
play this game of chase,

00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:41.337
where the older boy
ran after the other boy.

00:04:41.337 --> 00:04:42.532
He played the cop.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.720
When the cop caught up
to the younger boy,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.420
he pushed him down,

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.971
handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs,

00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:51.282
took a quarter out of 
the other child's pocket,

00:04:51.282 --> 00:04:54.874
saying, "I'm seizing that."

00:04:54.874 --> 00:04:58.214
He asked the child if 
he was carrying any drugs

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.659
or if he had a warrant.

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.664
Many times, I saw this game repeated,

00:05:02.664 --> 00:05:05.052
sometimes children would 
simply give up running,

00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:07.248
and stick their bodies flat 
against the ground

00:05:07.248 --> 00:05:10.593
with their hands above their heads,
or flat up against a wall.

00:05:10.593 --> 00:05:12.588
Children would yell at each other,

00:05:12.588 --> 00:05:13.870
"I'm going to lock you up,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.052
I'm going to lock you up
and you're never coming home!"

00:05:17.052 --> 00:05:21.406
Once I saw a six-year-old child
pull another child's pants down

00:05:21.406 --> 00:05:23.816
and try to do a cavity search.

00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:27.935
In the first 18 months that I lived
in this neighborhood,

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:31.627
I wrote down every time I saw
any contact between police

00:05:31.627 --> 00:05:34.173
and people that were my neighbors.

00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:36.652
So in the first 18 months,

00:05:36.652 --> 00:05:40.421
I watched the police stop 
pedestrians or people in cars,

00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:42.589
search people, run people's names,

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:44.533
chase people through the streets,

00:05:44.533 --> 00:05:46.306
pull people in for questioning,

00:05:46.306 --> 00:05:50.489
or make an arrest every single day,
with five exceptions.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:55.077
Fifty-two times, I watched the police
break down doors,

00:05:55.077 --> 00:05:57.118
chase people through houses

00:05:57.118 --> 00:06:00.337
or make an arrest of someone
in their home.

00:06:00.337 --> 00:06:03.150
Fourteen times
in this first year and a half,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.450
I watched the police punch, choke,
kick, stomp on or beat young men

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.269
after they had caught them.

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.665
Bit by bit, I got to know two brothers,

00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:16.209
Chuck and Tim.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.250
Chuck was 18 when we met,
a senior in high school.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.798
He was playing on the basketball team
and making C's and B's.

00:06:22.798 --> 00:06:24.697
His younger brother, Tim, was 10.

00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:27.848
And Tim loved Chuck;
he followed him around a lot,

00:06:27.848 --> 00:06:30.139
looked to Chuck to be a mentor.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.285
They lived with their mom and grandfather

00:06:32.285 --> 00:06:35.724
in a two-story row home 
with a front lawn and a back porch.

00:06:35.724 --> 00:06:39.385
Their mom was struggling with addiction
all while the boys were growing up.

00:06:39.385 --> 00:06:43.233
She never really was able 
to hold down a job for very long.

00:06:43.242 --> 00:06:46.281
It was their grandfather's pension
that supported the family,

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:49.484
not really enough to pay
for food and clothes

00:06:49.484 --> 00:06:52.215
and school supplies for growing boys.

00:06:52.215 --> 00:06:54.401
The family was really struggling.

00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:56.780
So when we met, Chuck was
a senior in high school.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.898
He had just turned 18.

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:02.770
That winter, a kid in the schoolyard

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.029
called Chuck's mom a crack whore.

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.904
Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow

00:07:08.904 --> 00:07:12.729
and the school cops charged him 
with aggravated assault.

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:14.479
The other kid was fine the next day,

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.952
I think it was his pride that was injured
more than anything.

00:07:17.952 --> 00:07:19.665
But anyway, since Chuck was 18,

00:07:19.665 --> 00:07:22.853
this agg. assault case sent him 
to adult county jail

00:07:22.853 --> 00:07:25.278
on State Road in northeast Philadelphia,

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:29.345
where he sat, unable to pay the bail --
he couldn't afford it --

00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:32.544
while the trial dates 
dragged on and on and on

00:07:32.544 --> 00:07:35.266
through almost his entire senior year.

00:07:35.926 --> 00:07:38.976
Finally, near the end of this season,

00:07:38.976 --> 00:07:42.323
the judge on this assault case
threw out most of the charges

00:07:42.323 --> 00:07:43.657
and Chuck came home

00:07:43.657 --> 00:07:48.004
with only a few hundred dollars' worth
of court fees hanging over his head.

00:07:48.004 --> 00:07:50.547
Tim was pretty happy that day.

00:07:50.547 --> 00:07:53.301
The next fall, Chuck tried 
to re-enroll as a senior,

00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:55.315
but the school secretary told him that

00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:58.446
he was then 19 and too old 
to be readmitted.

00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:02.113
Then the judge on his assault case
issued him a warrant for his arrest

00:08:02.113 --> 00:08:05.388
because he couldn't pay 
the 225 dollars in court fees

00:08:05.388 --> 00:08:08.915
that came due a few weeks after
the case ended.

00:08:08.915 --> 00:08:12.935
Then he was a high school dropout
living on the run.

00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:14.987
Tim's first arrest came later that year

00:08:14.987 --> 00:08:16.770
after he turned 11.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.900
Chuck had managed
to get his warrant lifted

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.561
and he was on a payment plan
for the court fees

00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:25.071
and he was driving Tim to school
in his girlfriend's car.

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:27.806
So a cop pulls them over, runs the car,

00:08:27.806 --> 00:08:31.591
and the car comes up 
as stolen in California.

00:08:31.591 --> 00:08:35.714
Chuck had no idea where in the history
of this car it had been stolen.

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:39.190
His girlfriend's uncle bought it
from a used car auction

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.657
in northeast Philly.

00:08:40.657 --> 00:08:43.485
Chuck and Tim had never been
outside of the tri-state,

00:08:43.485 --> 00:08:45.834
let alone to California.

00:08:45.834 --> 00:08:47.932
But anyway, the cops down at the precinct

00:08:47.932 --> 00:08:51.500
charged Chuck with 
receiving stolen property.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.312
And then a juvenile judge, 
a few days later,

00:08:54.312 --> 00:08:56.464
charged Tim, age 11,

00:08:56.464 --> 00:08:59.537
with accessory to receiving
a stolen property

00:08:59.537 --> 00:09:03.190
and then he was placed on 
three years of probation.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.332
With this probation sentence 
hanging over his head,

00:09:07.332 --> 00:09:09.419
Chuck sat his little brother down

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:12.868
and began teaching him
how to run from the police.

00:09:12.868 --> 00:09:15.200
They would sit side by side 
on their back porch

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.264
looking out into the shared alleyway

00:09:17.264 --> 00:09:21.104
and Chuck would coach Tim
how to spot undercover cars,

00:09:21.104 --> 00:09:26.071
how to negotiate a late-night police raid,
how and where to hide.

00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:28.691
I want you to imagine for a second

00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:31.060
what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.809
if they were living in a neighborhood
where kids were going to college,

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:37.238
not prison.

00:09:37.918 --> 00:09:41.071
A neighborhood like the one 
I got to grow up in.

00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:42.536
Okay, you might say.

00:09:42.536 --> 00:09:46.288
But Chuck and Tim, kids like them,
they're committing crimes!

00:09:46.288 --> 00:09:48.414
Don't they deserve to be in prison?

00:09:48.414 --> 00:09:52.228
Don't they deserve to be 
living in fear of arrest?

00:09:52.228 --> 00:09:55.350
Well, my answer would be no.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.430
They don't.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.457
And certainly not for the same things 
that other young people

00:09:59.457 --> 00:10:02.901
with more privilege are doing
with impunity.

00:10:02.901 --> 00:10:04.718
If Chuck had gone to my high school,

00:10:04.718 --> 00:10:07.041
that schoolyard fight 
would have ended there,

00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:08.717
as a schoolyard fight.

00:10:08.717 --> 00:10:12.267
It never would have become
an aggravated assault case.

00:10:12.937 --> 00:10:15.758
Not a single kid that
I went to college with

00:10:15.758 --> 00:10:17.437
has a criminal record right now.

00:10:17.437 --> 00:10:19.311
Not a single one.

00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:23.316
But can you imagine how many might have
if the police had stopped those kids

00:10:23.316 --> 00:10:27.183
and searched their pockets for drugs
as they walked to class?

00:10:27.183 --> 00:10:31.244
Or had raided their frat parties
in the middle of the night?

00:10:32.384 --> 00:10:33.656
Okay, you might say.

00:10:33.656 --> 00:10:35.646
But doesn't this high incarceration rate

00:10:35.646 --> 00:10:38.399
partly account for our 
really low crime rate?

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:40.823
Crime is down. That's a good thing.

00:10:40.823 --> 00:10:43.310
Totally, that is a good thing.
Crime is down.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.837
It dropped precipitously in
the '90s and through the 2000s.

00:10:46.837 --> 00:10:48.882
But according to a committee of academics

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:52.536
convened by the National Academy
of Sciences last year,

00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:56.545
the relationship between our
historically high incarceration rates

00:10:56.545 --> 00:11:00.129
and our low crime rate is pretty shaky.

00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:03.569
It turns out that the crime rate
goes up and down

00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:08.095
irrespective of how many young people
we send to prison.

00:11:09.265 --> 00:11:12.358
We tend to think about justice
in a pretty narrow way:

00:11:12.358 --> 00:11:15.962
good and bad, innocent and guilty.

00:11:15.962 --> 00:11:19.317
Injustice is about being 
wrongfully convicted.

00:11:19.317 --> 00:11:21.632
So if you're convicted 
of something you did do,

00:11:21.632 --> 00:11:23.467
you should be punished for it.

00:11:23.467 --> 00:11:25.233
There are innocent and guilty people,

00:11:25.233 --> 00:11:27.670
there are victims and 
there are perpetrators.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:32.071
Maybe we could think a little bit
more broadly than that.

00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:36.505
Right now, we're asking kids who live
in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,

00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:38.786
who have the least amount
of family resources,

00:11:38.786 --> 00:11:41.347
who are attending 
the country's worst schools,

00:11:41.347 --> 00:11:44.253
who are facing the toughest time
in the labor market,

00:11:44.253 --> 00:11:47.906
who are living in neighborhoods
where violence is an everyday problem,

00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:52.479
we're asking these kids to walk
the thinnest possible line --

00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:56.290
to basically never do anything wrong.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.791
Why are we not providing support
to young kids facing these challenges?

00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:08.037
Why are we offering only handcuffs,
jail time and this fugitive existence?

00:12:08.037 --> 00:12:10.543
Can we imagine something better?


00:12:10.543 --> 00:12:14.798
Can we imagine a criminal justice system
that prioritizes recovery,

00:12:14.798 --> 00:12:17.385
prevention, civic inclusion,

00:12:17.385 --> 00:12:20.086
rather than punishment?

00:12:20.086 --> 00:12:23.475
(Applause)

00:12:27.855 --> 00:12:30.130
A criminal justice system 
that acknowledges

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.110
the legacy of exclusion that poor people
of color in the U.S. have faced

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.266
and that does not promote
and perpetuate those exclusions.

00:12:38.266 --> 00:12:41.651
(Applause)

00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:47.853
And finally, a criminal justice system
that believes in black young people,

00:12:47.853 --> 00:12:51.717
rather than treating black young people 
as the enemy to be rounded up.

00:12:51.717 --> 00:12:55.440
(Applause)

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.287
The good news is that we already are.

00:13:02.287 --> 00:13:07.110
A few years ago, Michelle Alexander
wrote "The New Jim Crow,"

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.123
which got Americans to see 
incarceration as a civil rights issue

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:15.479
of historic proportions in a way
they had not seen it before.

00:13:15.479 --> 00:13:19.238
President Obama and Attorney General 
Eric Holder have come out very strongly

00:13:19.238 --> 00:13:20.955
on sentencing reform,

00:13:20.955 --> 00:13:24.699
on the need to address 
racial disparity in incarceration.

00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:27.309
We're seeing states throw out
Stop and Frisk

00:13:27.309 --> 00:13:30.345
as the civil rights violation that it is.

00:13:30.345 --> 00:13:35.400
We're seeing cities and states
decriminalize possession of marijuana.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.257
New York, New Jersey
and California

00:13:37.257 --> 00:13:41.094
have been dropping their 
prison populations, closing prisons,

00:13:41.094 --> 00:13:43.375
while also seeing a big drop in crime.

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:45.068
Texas has gotten into the game now,

00:13:45.068 --> 00:13:48.913
also closing prisons, 
investing in education.

00:13:48.913 --> 00:13:52.570
This curious coalition is building 
from the right and the left,

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.018
made up of former prisoners
and fiscal conservatives,

00:13:56.018 --> 00:13:59.349
of civil rights activists
and libertarians,

00:13:59.349 --> 00:14:03.329
of young people taking to the streets
to protest police violence

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:06.165
against unarmed black teenagers,

00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:08.211
and older, wealthier people --

00:14:08.211 --> 00:14:10.082
some of you are here in the audience --

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:14.017
pumping big money into 
decarceration initiatives

00:14:15.357 --> 00:14:17.107
In a deeply divided Congress,

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:19.810
the work of reforming 
our criminal justice system

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.602
is just about the only thing
that the right and the left

00:14:22.602 --> 00:14:25.187
are coming together on.

00:14:25.187 --> 00:14:29.101
I did not think I would see
this political moment in my lifetime.

00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:32.710
I think many of the people
who have been working tirelessly

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.872
to write about the causes and consequences

00:14:34.872 --> 00:14:37.104
of our historically 
high incarceration rates

00:14:37.104 --> 00:14:40.870
did not think we would see
this moment in our lifetime.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.653
The question for us now is,
how much can we make of it?

00:14:44.653 --> 00:14:47.618
How much can we change?

00:14:47.618 --> 00:14:50.182
I want to end with a call to young people,

00:14:50.182 --> 00:14:51.816
the young people attending college

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:54.926
and the young people
struggling to stay out of prison

00:14:54.926 --> 00:14:58.030
or to make it through prison
and return home.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:02.063
It may seem like these paths
to adulthood are worlds apart,

00:15:02.063 --> 00:15:06.505
but the young people participating
in these two institutions

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:08.430
conveying us to adulthood,

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.995
they have one thing in common:

00:15:10.995 --> 00:15:15.677
Both can be leaders in the work
of reforming our criminal justice system.

00:15:16.483 --> 00:15:19.815
Young people have always been leaders
in the fight for equal rights,

00:15:19.815 --> 00:15:22.080
the fight for more people 
to be granted dignity

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.635
and a fighting chance at freedom.

00:15:24.635 --> 00:15:27.014
The mission for the generation 
of young people

00:15:27.014 --> 00:15:31.994
coming of age in this, a sea-change
moment, potentially,

00:15:31.994 --> 00:15:37.258
is to end mass incarceration and 
build a new criminal justice system,

00:15:37.258 --> 00:15:40.185
emphasis on the word justice.

00:15:40.185 --> 00:15:41.589
Thanks.

00:15:41.589 --> 00:15:45.168
(Applause)
