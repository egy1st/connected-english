00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:02.807
In June of 1998,

00:00:02.807 --> 00:00:08.147
Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head,
North Carolina for France.

00:00:08.147 --> 00:00:10.469
That's her boat, the American Pearl.

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.913
It's 23 feet long and just six feet across

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:14.881
at its widest point.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:19.873
The deck was the size of a cargo bed
of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.

00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:22.357
Tori and her friends built it by hand,

00:00:22.357 --> 00:00:25.051
and it weighed about 1,800 pounds.

00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.414
Her plan was to row it alone

00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:29.364
across the Atlantic Ocean --

00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:31.500
no motor, no sail --

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.262
something no woman and no American
had ever done before.

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:36.841
This would be her route:

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:41.068
over 3,600 miles across
the open North Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:43.683
Professionally, Tori worked
as a project administrator

00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:45.478
for the city of Louisville, Kentucky,

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.289
her hometown,

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.704
but her real passion was exploring.

00:00:49.704 --> 00:00:52.188
This was not her first big expedition.

00:00:52.188 --> 00:00:56.554
Several years earlier, she'd become
the first woman to ski to the South Pole.

00:00:56.554 --> 00:00:58.783
She was an accomplished rower in college,

00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:02.265
even competed for a spot
on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team,

00:01:02.265 --> 00:01:06.189
but this, this was different.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:12.830
(Video) (Music) Tori Murden McClure:
Hi. It's Sunday, July 5.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.711
Sector time 9 a.m.

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:17.892
So that's Kentucky time now.

00:01:17.892 --> 00:01:20.237
Dawn Landes: Tori made
these videos as she rowed.

00:01:20.237 --> 00:01:22.536
This is her 21st day at sea.

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:25.299
At this point, she'd covered
over 1,000 miles,

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.969
had had no radio contact
in more than two weeks

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.409
following a storm that disabled
all her long-range communications systems

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.123
just five days in.

00:01:33.123 --> 00:01:35.144
Most days looked like this.

00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:38.905
At this point, she'd rowed
over 200,000 strokes,

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:41.227
fighting the current and the wind.

00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:44.710
Some days, she traveled
as little as 15 feet.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.219
Yeah.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.866
And as frustrating as those days were,

00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:51.908
other days were like this.

00:01:51.908 --> 00:01:55.019
(Video) TMM: And I want to show you
my little friends.

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:59.930
DL: She saw fish, dolphins,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.461
whales, sharks,

00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:05.340
and even some sea turtles.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.615
After two weeks with no human contact,

00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:09.937
Tori was able to contact
a local cargo ship

00:02:09.937 --> 00:02:12.863
via VHF radio.

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:16.648
(Video) TMM: Do you guys
have a weather report, over?

00:02:16.648 --> 00:02:19.782
Man: Heading up to a low

00:02:19.782 --> 00:02:22.267
ahead of you but it's heading,

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.147
and you're obviously going northeast

00:02:24.147 --> 00:02:26.051
and there's a high behind us.

00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:27.909
That'd be coming

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.416
east-northeast also.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.019
TMM: Good.

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.925
DL: She's pretty happy to talk
to another human at this point.

00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:38.367
(Video) TMM: So weather report
says nothing dramatic

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:40.980
is going to happen soon.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.991
DL: What the weather report
didn't tell her

00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:46.089
was that she was rowing right into
the path of Hurricane Danielle

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:50.187
in the worst hurricane season
on record in the North Atlantic.

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:55.133
(Video) TMM: Just sprained my ankle.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:58.848
There's a very strong wind
from the east now.

00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:01.286
It's blowing about.

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:04.165
It's blowing!

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.859
After 12 days of storm

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.693
I get to row for four hours

00:03:08.693 --> 00:03:10.837
without a flagging wind.

00:03:10.837 --> 00:03:12.527
I'm not very happy right now.

00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:14.196
As happy as I was this morning,

00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:18.050
I am unhappy now, so ...

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.195
DL: After nearly three months at sea,

00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:24.888
she'd covered over 3,000 miles.

00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:26.908
She was two thirds of the way there,

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:30.438
but in the storm, the waves were
the size of a seven-story building.

00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:32.614
Her boat kept capsizing.

00:03:32.614 --> 00:03:35.818
Some of them were pitchpole capsizes,
flipping her end over end,

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:38.303
and rowing became impossible.

00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:40.536
(Video) TMM: It's 6:30 a.m.

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:45.060
I'm in something big, bad and ugly.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.660
Two capsizes.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.477
Last capsize, I took the rib
off the top of my ceiling with my back.

00:03:56.356 --> 00:03:59.839
I've had about six capsizes now.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.346
The last one was a pitchpole.

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:05.295
I have the Argus beacon with me.

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:07.083
I would set off the distress signal,

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:11.309
but quite frankly, I don't think they'd
ever be able to find this little boat.

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:13.120
It's so far underwater right now,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.299
the only part that's showing
pretty much is the cabin.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.434
It's about 10 a.m.

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:23.127
I've lost track of the number of capsizes.

00:04:23.127 --> 00:04:26.169
I seem to capsize about
every 15 minutes.

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.582
I think I may have broken my left arm.

00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:34.667
The waves

00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:37.024
are tearing the boat to shreds.

00:04:38.556 --> 00:04:40.042
I keep praying because

00:04:40.042 --> 00:04:42.550
I'm not sure I'm going
to make it through this.

00:04:43.128 --> 00:04:45.447
DL: Tori set off her distress beacon

00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:48.341
and was rescued
by a passing container ship.

00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:52.325
They found her abandoned boat
two months later adrift near France.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.506
I read about it in the newspaper.

00:04:55.506 --> 00:04:59.779
In 1998, I was a high school student
living in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.333
Now, I live in New York City.
I'm a songwriter.

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:05.630
And her bravery stuck with me,
and I'm adapting her story

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.252
into a musical called "Row."

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.639
When Tori returned home,

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.473
she was feeling disheartened,

00:05:16.473 --> 00:05:17.667
she was broke.

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:19.956
She was having a hard time
making the transition

00:05:19.956 --> 00:05:22.115
back into civilization.

00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:26.718
In this scene, she sits at home.

00:05:26.718 --> 00:05:28.965
The phone is ringing,
her friends are calling,

00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:31.171
but she doesn't know how to talk to them.

00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.166
She sings this song.
It's called "Dear Heart."

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:37.522
(Guitar)

00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:44.046
When I was dreaming,

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:47.297
I took my body

00:05:47.297 --> 00:05:50.617
to beautiful places

00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:53.937
I'd never been.

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:57.211
I saw Gibraltar,

00:05:57.211 --> 00:06:00.601
and stars of Kentucky

00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:03.875
burned in the moonlight,

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:07.451
making me smile.

00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:10.714
And when I awoke here,

00:06:10.714 --> 00:06:14.161
the sky was so cloudy.

00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:17.534
I walked to a party

00:06:17.534 --> 00:06:20.995
where people I know

00:06:20.995 --> 00:06:24.222
try hard to know me

00:06:24.222 --> 00:06:27.426
and ask where I've been,

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:30.514
but I can't explain

00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:34.369
what I've seen to them.

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:41.242
Ah, listen, dear heart.

00:06:41.242 --> 00:06:44.359
Just pay attention,

00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:48.395
go right from the start.

00:06:48.395 --> 00:06:54.313
Ah, listen, dear heart.

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:57.052
You can fall off the map,

00:06:57.052 --> 00:07:01.532
but don't fall apart.

00:07:01.532 --> 00:07:03.377
Ooh ooh ooh,

00:07:03.377 --> 00:07:08.245
ah ah ah ah ah.

00:07:08.245 --> 00:07:11.589
Ah ah,

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:14.421
ah ah ah.

00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:17.630
When I was out there,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.020
the ocean would hold me,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.364
rock me and throw me,

00:07:24.364 --> 00:07:27.684
light as a child.

00:07:27.684 --> 00:07:31.121
But now I'm so heavy,

00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:34.325
nothing consoles me.

00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:37.761
My mind floats like driftwood,

00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:41.035
wayward and wild.

00:07:41.035 --> 00:07:47.582
Ah, listen, dear heart.

00:07:47.582 --> 00:07:50.717
Just pay attention,

00:07:50.717 --> 00:07:54.456
go right from the start.

00:07:54.456 --> 00:08:00.748
Ah, listen, dear heart.

00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:04.208
You can fall off the map,

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:08.132
but don't fall apart.

00:08:08.132 --> 00:08:12.334
Ooh.

00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:18.139
Eventually, Tori starts to get
her feet under her.

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:20.600
She starts hanging out
with her friends again.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.478
She meets a guy and falls
in love for the first time.

00:08:24.478 --> 00:08:27.543
She gets a new job working
for another Louisville native,

00:08:27.543 --> 00:08:29.818
Muhammad Ali.

00:08:29.818 --> 00:08:32.558
One day, at lunch with her new boss,

00:08:32.558 --> 00:08:34.926
Tori shares the news
that two other women

00:08:34.926 --> 00:08:37.689
are setting out to row
across the mid-Atlantic,

00:08:37.689 --> 00:08:41.381
to do something that she
almost died trying to do.

00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:44.502
His response was classic Ali:

00:08:44.502 --> 00:08:46.418
"You don't want to go through life

00:08:46.418 --> 00:08:50.175
as the woman who almost
rowed across the ocean."

00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:52.172
He was right.

00:08:52.172 --> 00:08:53.890
Tori rebuilt the American Pearl,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.678
and in December of 1999,

00:08:55.678 --> 00:08:57.954
she did it.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.995
(Applause)
(Guitar)

00:09:04.873 --> 00:09:07.404
Thank you.

00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:10.305
(Applause)
