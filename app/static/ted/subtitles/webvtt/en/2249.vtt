00:00:01.206 --> 00:00:07.125
(Music)

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:18.822
These bees are in my backyard
in Berkeley, California.

00:00:18.822 --> 00:00:21.221
Until last year,
I'd never kept bees before,

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:25.270
but National Geographic asked me
to photograph a story about them,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.769
and I decided, to be able
to take compelling images,

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.253
I should start keeping bees myself.

00:00:30.253 --> 00:00:31.948
And as you may know,

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.572
bees pollinate one third
of our food crops,

00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:37.730
and lately they've been having
a really hard time.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.281
So as a photographer, I wanted to explore
what this problem really looks like.

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:45.466
So I'm going to show you
what I found over the last year.

00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:47.900
This furry little creature

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.243
is a fresh young bee halfway emerged
from its brood cell,

00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:55.283
and bees right now are dealing
with several different problems,

00:00:55.283 --> 00:00:59.535
including pesticides, diseases,
and habitat loss,

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:04.146
but the single greatest threat
is a parasitic mite from Asia,

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:06.475
Varroa destructor.

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:09.354
And this pinhead-sized mite
crawls onto young bees

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:11.699
and sucks their blood.

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:13.696
This eventually destroys a hive

00:01:13.696 --> 00:01:16.940
because it weakens
the immune system of the bees,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.476
and it makes them more vulnerable
to stress and disease.

00:01:21.776 --> 00:01:23.773
Now, bees are the most sensitive

00:01:23.773 --> 00:01:26.513
when they're developing
inside their brood cells,

00:01:26.513 --> 00:01:29.624
and I wanted to know
what that process really looks like,

00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:32.248
so I teamed up
with a bee lab at U.C. Davis

00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:35.343
and figured out how to raise bees
in front of a camera.

00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:38.981
I'm going to show you
the first 21 days of a bee's life

00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:41.770
condensed into 60 seconds.

00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:48.567
This is a bee egg
as it hatches into a larva,

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:53.012
and those newly hatched larvae
swim around their cells

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:57.335
feeding on this white goo
that nurse bees secrete for them.

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:04.159
Then, their head and their legs
slowly differentiate

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.509
as they transform into pupae.

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.853
Here's that same pupation process,

00:02:11.853 --> 00:02:15.243
and you can actually see the mites
running around in the cells.

00:02:15.243 --> 00:02:19.510
Then the tissue in their body reorganizes

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.115
and the pigment slowly
develops in their eyes.

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:32.757
The last step of the process
is their skin shrivels up

00:02:32.757 --> 00:02:35.245
and they sprout hair.

00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:39.237
(Music)

00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:51.659
So -- (Applause)

00:02:54.703 --> 00:02:57.907
As you can see halfway
through that video,

00:02:57.907 --> 00:03:00.461
the mites were running around
on the baby bees,

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:04.390
and the way that beekeepers
typically manage these mites

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.404
is they treat their hives with chemicals.

00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:09.670
In the long run, that's bad news,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.223
so researchers are working
on finding alternatives

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:15.387
to control these mites.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:18.963
This is one of those alternatives.

00:03:18.963 --> 00:03:23.328
It's an experimental breeding program
at the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge,

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:27.045
and this queen and her attendant bees
are part of that program.

00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:31.430
Now, the researchers figured out

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.152
that some of the bees have
a natural ability to fight mites,

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:39.322
so they set out to breed
a line of mite-resistant bees.

00:03:40.782 --> 00:03:43.418
This is what it takes
to breed bees in a lab.

00:03:43.418 --> 00:03:46.158
The virgin queen is sedated

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:51.200
and then artificially inseminated
using this precision instrument.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.478
Now, this procedure allows the researchers

00:03:53.478 --> 00:03:58.500
to control exactly
which bees are being crossed,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.627
but there's a tradeoff
in having this much control.

00:04:01.627 --> 00:04:04.832
They succeeded in breeding
mite-resistant bees,

00:04:04.832 --> 00:04:07.920
but in that process, those bees
started to lose traits

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.685
like their gentleness
and their ability to store honey,

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:14.194
so to overcome that problem,

00:04:14.194 --> 00:04:17.742
these researchers are now collaborating
with commercial beekeepers.

00:04:18.252 --> 00:04:23.120
This is Bret Adee opening
one of his 72,000 beehives.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.750
He and his brother run the largest
beekeeping operation in the world,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.409
and the USDA is integrating their
mite-resistant bees into his operation

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.052
with the hope that over time,

00:04:35.052 --> 00:04:38.723
they'll be able to select the bees
that are not only mite-resistant

00:04:38.723 --> 00:04:43.707
but also retain all of these qualities
that make them useful to us.

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:45.860
And to say it like that

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.157
makes it sound like we're manipulating
and exploiting bees,

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:52.593
and the truth is, we've been doing that
for thousands of years.

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:57.747
We took this wild creature
and put it inside of a box,

00:04:57.747 --> 00:04:59.861
practically domesticating it,

00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:03.970
and originally that was
so that we could harvest their honey,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.725
but over time we started losing
our native pollinators,

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:08.420
our wild pollinators,

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.485
and there are many places now
where those wild pollinators

00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:15.284
can no longer meet the pollination
demands of our agriculture,

00:05:15.284 --> 00:05:20.508
so these managed bees have become
an integral part of our food system.

00:05:20.508 --> 00:05:23.227
So when people talk about saving bees,

00:05:23.227 --> 00:05:25.360
my interpretation of that

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.588
is we need to save
our relationship to bees,

00:05:28.588 --> 00:05:33.592
and in order to design new solutions,

00:05:33.592 --> 00:05:38.693
we have to understand
the basic biology of bees

00:05:38.693 --> 00:05:44.936
and understand the effects
of stressors that we sometimes cannot see.

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.114
In other words, we have
to understand bees up close.

00:05:49.114 --> 00:05:51.384
Thank you.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:53.198
(Applause)
