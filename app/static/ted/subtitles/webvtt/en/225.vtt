00:00:00.531 --> 00:00:02.135
By day, I'm a venture capitalist.

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.706
On weekends, I love rockets.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.479
I love photography, I love rockets.

00:00:05.503 --> 00:00:07.661
I'm going to talk
about a hobby that can scale

00:00:07.685 --> 00:00:09.793
and show you photos
I've taken over the years

00:00:09.817 --> 00:00:12.922
with kids like these, that hopefully
will grow up to love rocketry

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.444
and eventually become
a Richard Branson or Diamandis.

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:18.477
My son designed a rocket
that became stable, a golf ball rocket.

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:20.754
I thought it was quite
an interesting experiment

00:00:20.778 --> 00:00:22.520
in the principles of rocket science.

00:00:22.544 --> 00:00:24.270
And it flies straight as an arrow.

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:25.647
Baking soda and vinegar.

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:26.981
Night shots are beautiful,

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.532
piercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way.

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:32.755
2-stage rockets
with video cameras on them,

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:36.557
onboard computers logging their flights,
rocket gliders that fly back to Earth.

00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:38.824
I use RockSim to simulate
flights before they go

00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:40.523
to see if they'll break supersonic,

00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:43.368
then fly them with onboard computers
to verify performance.

00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:46.069
To launch the big stuff,
you go to the middle of nowhere:

00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:48.428
Black Rock Desert,
where dangerous things happen.

00:00:48.452 --> 00:00:50.191
The boys and the rockets get bigger.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:52.826
They use motors
used on cruise-missile boosters.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.579
They rumble the belly and leave
even photographers in awe,

00:00:55.603 --> 00:00:56.754
watching the spectacle.

00:00:56.778 --> 00:00:59.564
These rockets use
experimental motors like nitrous oxide.

00:00:59.588 --> 00:01:01.589
They use solid propellant most frequently.

00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:02.952
It's a strange kind of love.

00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:06.184
RocketMavericks.com with my photos,
if you want to learn about this,

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:07.544
participate, be a spectator.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.545
We had to call it Rocket Mavericks.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.443
This one was great, went to 100,000 feet
-- but didn't quite.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:15.744
Actually, it went 11 feet into solid clay
and became a bunker-buster.

00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:17.192
It had to be dug out.

00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:20.968
Rockets often spiral out of control
if you put too much propellant in them.

00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:22.151
Here was a drag race.

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:24.415
At night you can see
what happened in a second;

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.211
in daytime, we call them land sharks.

00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:29.522
Sometimes they just explode
before your eyes or come down supersonic.

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:30.555
(Laughter)

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.056
To take this shot, I did what I often do,
which is go way beyond the pads,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.680
where none of the spectators are.

00:01:35.704 --> 00:01:38.284
And if we can run the video,
I'll show you what it took

00:01:38.308 --> 00:01:39.655
to get this DreamWorks shot.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.336
(Video) Voices: Woo-hoo! Yeah. Nice.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.246
Steve Jurvetson: They realize the computer
failed, they're yelling "Deploy!"

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.421
(Video) Man: Oh, shit.

00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:50.074
SJ: This is when they realize
everything's gone haywire.

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:51.719
(Video) Man: It's going ballistic.

00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:52.894
SJ: I'll just be quiet.

00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:54.069
(Video) Woman: No!

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:56.093
Come on, come on, come on.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.762
SJ: And that's me over there,
taking photos the whole way.

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:05.142
Things often go wrong.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.439
Some people watch this
because of a NASCAR-like fascination

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:10.098
with things bumping and grinding.

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:12.839
Burning the parachute as it fell.
That was last weekend.

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:15.593
This guy went up, went supersonic,
ripped the fin can off.

00:02:15.617 --> 00:02:16.768
The art sale in the sky.

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:18.371
A burning metal hunk coming back.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.213
These things dropped
down from above all through the weekend

00:02:21.237 --> 00:02:23.027
of rocket launch after rocket launch.

00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:24.945
It's a cadence you can't quite imagine.

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.845
I try to capture the mishaps;
it's a challenge in photography

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.463
when these things take place
in a fraction of a second.

00:02:30.487 --> 00:02:32.018
Why do it? For things like this:

00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:34.189
Gene from Alabama drives out there

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:37.285
with this rocket he's built
with X-ray sensors, video cameras,

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.600
festooned with electronics.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:40.345
He succeeds getting to 100,000 feet,

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.049
leaving the atmosphere,
seeing a thin blue line of space.

00:02:43.073 --> 00:02:46.465
It is this breathtaking image --
success, of course -- that motivates us

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.276
and motivates kids to follow
and understand rocket science,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.404
understand the importance
of physics and math

00:02:51.428 --> 00:02:53.763
and, in many ways,
to have that awe at exploration

00:02:53.787 --> 00:02:55.321
of the frontiers of the unknown.

00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:56.496
Thank you.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.768
(Applause)
