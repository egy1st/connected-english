(Music)

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:10.610
Dannielle Hadley: Life
in Pennsylvania means just that:

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.302
life without the possibility of parole.

00:00:14.302 --> 00:00:16.182
For us lifers,

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.411
as we call ourselves,

00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:20.455
our only chance for release

00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:22.684
is through commutation,

00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:27.304
which has only been granted
to two women since 1989,

00:00:27.304 --> 00:00:30.105
close to 30 years ago.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:33.959
Our song, "This Is Not Our Home,"

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:35.887
it tells of our experiences

00:00:35.887 --> 00:00:41.204
while doing life without
the possibility of parole.

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:45.683
(Music)

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.300
Brenda Watkins: I'm a woman.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.327
I'm a grandmother.

00:01:06.327 --> 00:01:09.206
I'm a daughter.

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:12.123
I have a son.

00:01:12.123 --> 00:01:14.770
I'm not an angel.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.928
I'm not the devil.

00:01:17.928 --> 00:01:20.711
I came to jail

00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:24.636
when I was so young.

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:35.292
I spend my time here

00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:41.283
inside these prison walls.

00:01:41.283 --> 00:01:44.851
Lost friends to death,

00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:51.267
saw some go home.

00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:55.090
Watch years pass,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.254
people come and go,

00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:09.492
while I do life without parole.

00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:18.378
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I've done.

00:02:18.378 --> 00:02:21.373
I'm doing time here.

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:23.254
This is not my home.

00:02:23.254 --> 00:02:28.316
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

00:02:28.316 --> 00:02:32.449
Will I see

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.187
my family

00:02:36.187 --> 00:02:41.840
or die alone?

00:02:46.728 --> 00:02:50.211
As the years go by,

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:55.830
I hold back my tears,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:04.305
because if I cry I'd give in to fear.

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:12.110
I must be strong, have to hold on.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.029
Gotta get through

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:20.378
another year.

00:03:20.378 --> 00:03:25.881
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I've done.

00:03:25.881 --> 00:03:29.573
I'm doing time here.
This is not my home.

00:03:29.573 --> 00:03:34.658
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

00:03:34.658 --> 00:03:39.128
Will I see

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.250
my family

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.550
or die alone?

00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:56.669
I'm not saying that I'm not guilty,

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:01.244
I'm not saying that I shouldn't pay.

00:04:01.244 --> 00:04:04.982
All I'm asking is for forgiveness.

00:04:04.982 --> 00:04:11.921
Gotta have hope I'll be free someday.

00:04:16.731 --> 00:04:22.605
Is there a place for me

00:04:22.605 --> 00:04:26.901
in the world out there?

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:33.800
Will they ever know or care
that I'm chained?

00:04:35.246 --> 00:04:42.363
Is there redemption for the sin
of my younger days?

00:04:42.363 --> 00:04:46.308
Because I've changed.

00:04:46.308 --> 00:04:50.390
Lord knows I've changed.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.596
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I've done.

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:58.916
I'm doing time here.
This is not my home.

00:04:58.916 --> 00:05:03.630
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.530
Will I see

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.572
my family

00:05:10.572 --> 00:05:15.980
or die alone?

00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:23.209
Will I see

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:26.408
my family

00:05:26.408 --> 00:05:31.142
