WEBVTT

00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:02.349
Why do we cheat?

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.928
And why do happy people cheat?

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:13.447
And when we say "infidelity,"
what exactly do we mean?

00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:20.586
Is it a hookup, a love story,
paid sex, a chat room,

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.625
a massage with a happy ending?

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:29.494
Why do we think that men cheat
out of boredom and fear of intimacy,

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:34.256
but women cheat out of loneliness
and hunger for intimacy?

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.999
And is an affair always
the end of a relationship?

00:00:41.294 --> 00:00:44.490
For the past 10 years,
I have traveled the globe

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.535
and worked extensively
with hundreds of couples

00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:49.722
who have been shattered by infidelity.

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:54.602
There is one simple act of transgression

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:58.990
that can rob a couple
of their relationship,

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:03.245
their happiness and their
very identity: an affair.

00:01:03.903 --> 00:01:09.117
And yet, this extremely common
act is so poorly understood.

00:01:10.593 --> 00:01:15.224
So this talk is for anyone
who has ever loved.

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:21.525
Adultery has existed
since marriage was invented,

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:24.070
and so, too, the taboo against it.

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:30.827
In fact, infidelity has a tenacity
that marriage can only envy,

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:34.285
so much so, that this is
the only commandment

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.221
that is repeated twice in the Bible:

00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:42.325
once for doing it, and once
just for thinking about it.

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.595
(Laughter)

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.922
So how do we reconcile
what is universally forbidden,

00:01:48.922 --> 00:01:51.367
yet universally practiced?

00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:58.036
Now, throughout history, men
practically had a license to cheat

00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:00.331
with little consequence,

00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:04.739
and supported by a host
of biological and evolutionary theories

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:07.315
that justified their need to roam,

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:11.292
so the double standard
is as old as adultery itself.

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:17.716
But who knows what's really going on
under the sheets there, right?

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.752
Because when it comes to sex,

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:23.939
the pressure for men
is to boast and to exaggerate,

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:29.484
but the pressure for women
is to hide, minimize and deny,

00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:33.710
which isn't surprising when you consider
that there are still nine countries

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.234
where women can be killed for straying.

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:42.420
Now, monogamy used to be
one person for life.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.515
Today, monogamy is one person at a time.

00:02:46.268 --> 00:02:48.133
(Laughter)

00:02:48.158 --> 00:02:50.023
(Applause)

00:02:52.364 --> 00:02:54.300
I mean, many of you probably have said,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.888
"I am monogamous in all my relationships."

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.863
(Laughter)

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:02.260
We used to marry,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.169
and had sex for the first time.

00:03:04.614 --> 00:03:06.076
But now we marry,

00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:08.003
and we stop having sex with others.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:13.677
The fact is that monogamy
had nothing to do with love.

00:03:14.332 --> 00:03:16.895
Men relied on women's fidelity

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.959
in order to know whose children these are,

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.300
and who gets the cows when I die.

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:26.655
Now, everyone wants to know

00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:28.403
what percentage of people cheat.

00:03:28.403 --> 00:03:31.634
I've been asked that question
since I arrived at this conference.

00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:34.236
(Laughter)

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.640
It applies to you.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:40.959
But the definition of infidelity
keeps on expanding:

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.021
sexting, watching porn, staying
secretly active on dating apps.

00:03:46.332 --> 00:03:50.817
So because there is no
universally agreed-upon definition

00:03:50.817 --> 00:03:53.956
of what even constitutes an infidelity,

00:03:53.956 --> 00:03:59.586
estimates vary widely,
from 26 percent to 75 percent.

00:04:00.728 --> 00:04:03.959
But on top of it, we are
walking contradictions.

00:04:04.173 --> 00:04:07.792
So 95 percent of us will say
that it is terribly wrong

00:04:07.792 --> 00:04:10.969
for our partner to lie
about having an affair,

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.190
but just about the same
amount of us will say

00:04:13.214 --> 00:04:16.348
that that's exactly what we
would do if we were having one.

00:04:16.372 --> 00:04:18.808
(Laughter)

00:04:19.872 --> 00:04:23.577
Now, I like this definition
of an affair --

00:04:23.577 --> 00:04:27.326
it brings together the three key elements:

00:04:27.326 --> 00:04:33.032
a secretive relationship,
which is the core structure of an affair;

00:04:33.032 --> 00:04:37.826
an emotional connection
to one degree or another;

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:39.466
and a sexual alchemy.

00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:43.337
And alchemy is the key word here,

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:50.265
because the erotic frisson is such that
the kiss that you only imagine giving,

00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:53.349
can be as powerful and as enchanting

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.839
as hours of actual lovemaking.

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.315
As Marcel Proust said,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.640
it's our imagination that is responsible
for love, not the other person.

00:05:05.902 --> 00:05:09.758
So it's never been easier to cheat,

00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:13.235
and it's never been more
difficult to keep a secret.

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.459
And never has infidelity exacted
such a psychological toll.

00:05:19.975 --> 00:05:23.342
When marriage was an economic enterprise,

00:05:23.342 --> 00:05:26.308
infidelity threatened
our economic security.

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:29.959
But now that marriage
is a romantic arrangement,

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:33.779
infidelity threatens
our emotional security.

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:38.040
Ironically, we used to turn to adultery --

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.269
that was the space where
we sought pure love.

00:05:41.293 --> 00:05:43.482
But now that we seek love in marriage,

00:05:43.482 --> 00:05:45.142
adultery destroys it.

00:05:46.943 --> 00:05:51.347
Now, there are three ways that I think
infidelity hurts differently today.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.613
We have a romantic ideal
in which we turn to one person

00:05:59.613 --> 00:06:02.810
to fulfill an endless list of needs:

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.410
to be my greatest lover, my best friend,

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.563
the best parent, my trusted confidant,

00:06:09.563 --> 00:06:12.657
my emotional companion,
my intellectual equal.

00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:17.929
And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique,

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:21.245
I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable,

00:06:21.245 --> 00:06:22.435
I'm the one.

00:06:23.356 --> 00:06:26.514
And infidelity tells me I'm not.

00:06:27.308 --> 00:06:29.197
It is the ultimate betrayal.

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:33.125
Infidelity shatters
the grand ambition of love.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.561
But if throughout history,
infidelity has always been painful,

00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:41.919
today it is often traumatic,

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.720
because it threatens our sense of self.

00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:47.823
So my patient Fernando, he's plagued.

00:06:47.847 --> 00:06:50.595
He goes on: "I thought I knew my life.

00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:54.801
I thought I knew who you were,
who we were as a couple, who I was.

00:06:54.801 --> 00:06:57.022
Now, I question everything."

00:06:57.632 --> 00:07:02.819
Infidelity -- a violation of trust,
a crisis of identity.

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.124
"Can I ever trust you again?" he asks.

00:07:05.148 --> 00:07:07.450
"Can I ever trust anyone again?"

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:11.905
And this is also what my patient
Heather is telling me,

00:07:11.905 --> 00:07:14.532
when she's talking to me
about her story with Nick.

00:07:14.532 --> 00:07:15.982
Married, two kids.

00:07:15.982 --> 00:07:18.659
Nick just left on a business trip,

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:22.190
and Heather is playing
on his iPad with the boys,

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.127
when she sees a message
appear on the screen:

00:07:25.127 --> 00:07:26.665
"Can't wait to see you."

00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:30.054
Strange, she thinks,
we just saw each other.

00:07:30.863 --> 00:07:32.379
And then another message:

00:07:32.903 --> 00:07:35.140
"Can't wait to hold you in my arms."

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:38.243
And Heather realizes

00:07:38.243 --> 00:07:39.611
these are not for her.

00:07:40.435 --> 00:07:43.808
She also tells me
that her father had affairs,

00:07:43.812 --> 00:07:47.753
but her mother, she found
one little receipt in the pocket,

00:07:47.777 --> 00:07:49.935
and a little bit of lipstick
on the collar.

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:54.610
Heather, she goes digging,

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.673
and she finds hundreds of messages,

00:07:57.673 --> 00:08:01.086
and photos exchanged
and desires expressed.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.118
The vivid details
of Nick's two-year affair

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:07.300
unfold in front of her in real time,

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:09.272
And it made me think:

00:08:09.272 --> 00:08:14.318
Affairs in the digital age
are death by a thousand cuts.

00:08:15.854 --> 00:08:19.113
But then we have another paradox
that we're dealing with these days.

00:08:19.113 --> 00:08:21.417
Because of this romantic ideal,

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:26.475
we are relying on our partner's
fidelity with a unique fervor.

00:08:26.999 --> 00:08:30.544
But we also have never
been more inclined to stray,

00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:33.255
and not because we have new desires today,

00:08:33.255 --> 00:08:35.001
but because we live in an era

00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:38.682
where we feel that we are
entitled to pursue our desires,

00:08:38.682 --> 00:08:42.138
because this is the culture
where I deserve to be happy.

00:08:43.268 --> 00:08:47.031
And if we used to divorce
because we were unhappy,

00:08:47.035 --> 00:08:49.864
today we divorce
because we could be happier.

00:08:51.562 --> 00:08:54.847
And if divorce carried all the shame,

00:08:54.847 --> 00:08:58.738
today, choosing to stay when you can leave

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:00.102
is the new shame.

00:09:00.657 --> 00:09:03.168
So Heather, she can't talk to her friends

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:06.429
because she's afraid that they
will judge her for still loving Nick,

00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:09.977
and everywhere she turns,
she gets the same advice:

00:09:09.977 --> 00:09:12.602
Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb.

00:09:13.744 --> 00:09:18.737
And if the situation were reversed,
Nick would be in the same situation.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.364
Staying is the new shame.

00:09:23.395 --> 00:09:26.359
So if we can divorce,

00:09:26.359 --> 00:09:28.455
why do we still have affairs?

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:34.563
Now, the typical assumption
is that if someone cheats,

00:09:34.563 --> 00:09:38.408
either there's something wrong
in your relationship or wrong with you.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.686
But millions of people
can't all be pathological.

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:48.291
The logic goes like this: If you
have everything you need at home,

00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:51.715
then there is no need
to go looking elsewhere,

00:09:51.715 --> 00:09:55.182
assuming that there is such
a thing as a perfect marriage

00:09:55.187 --> 00:09:58.038
that will inoculate us against wanderlust.

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:02.499
But what if passion
has a finite shelf life?

00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:07.338
What if there are things
that even a good relationship

00:10:07.338 --> 00:10:08.743
can never provide?

00:10:10.187 --> 00:10:13.202
If even happy people cheat,

00:10:13.202 --> 00:10:14.798
what is it about?

00:10:16.765 --> 00:10:19.641
The vast majority of people
that I actually work with

00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:22.425
are not at all chronic philanderers.

00:10:22.429 --> 00:10:26.475
They are often people who are
deeply monogamous in their beliefs,

00:10:26.475 --> 00:10:28.048
and at least for their partner.

00:10:28.865 --> 00:10:31.501
But they find themselves in a conflict

00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:34.540
between their values and their behavior.

00:10:35.572 --> 00:10:39.935
They often are people who have
actually been faithful for decades,

00:10:39.935 --> 00:10:42.574
but one day they cross a line

00:10:42.574 --> 00:10:45.047
that they never thought they would cross,

00:10:45.047 --> 00:10:47.794
and at the risk of losing everything.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.635
But for a glimmer of what?

00:10:51.969 --> 00:10:54.609
Affairs are an act of betrayal,

00:10:54.609 --> 00:10:57.705
and they are also an expression
of longing and loss.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.528
At the heart of an affair,
you will often find

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:06.789
a longing and a yearning
for an emotional connection,

00:11:06.789 --> 00:11:12.559
for novelty, for freedom,
for autonomy, for sexual intensity,

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:16.226
a wish to recapture
lost parts of ourselves

00:11:16.226 --> 00:11:21.540
or an attempt to bring back
vitality in the face of loss and tragedy.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.766
I'm thinking about
another patient of mine, Priya,

00:11:25.766 --> 00:11:28.382
who is blissfully married,

00:11:28.382 --> 00:11:29.847
loves her husband,

00:11:29.847 --> 00:11:32.230
and would never want to hurt the man.

00:11:32.713 --> 00:11:34.831
But she also tells me

00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:38.005
that she's always done
what was expected of her:

00:11:38.005 --> 00:11:41.685
good girl, good wife, good mother,

00:11:41.685 --> 00:11:44.677
taking care of her immigrant parents.

00:11:44.677 --> 00:11:49.189
Priya, she fell for the arborist
who removed the tree from her yard

00:11:49.214 --> 00:11:50.675
after Hurricane Sandy.

00:11:51.524 --> 00:11:56.087
And with his truck and his tattoos,
he's quite the opposite of her.

00:11:57.547 --> 00:12:02.769
But at 47, Priya's affair is about
the adolescence that she never had.

00:12:03.753 --> 00:12:09.030
And her story highlights for me
that when we seek the gaze of another,

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:13.748
it isn't always our partner
that we are turning away from,

00:12:13.748 --> 00:12:16.585
but the person that
we have ourselves become.

00:12:17.728 --> 00:12:21.274
And it isn't so much that we're
looking for another person,

00:12:21.274 --> 00:12:24.816
as much as we are
looking for another self.

00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:28.602
Now, all over the world,

00:12:28.602 --> 00:12:32.458
there is one word that people
who have affairs always tell me.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.911
They feel alive.

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:40.286
And they often will tell me
stories of recent losses --

00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:42.141
of a parent who died,

00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:44.341
and a friend that went too soon,

00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:46.141
and bad news at the doctor.

00:12:47.482 --> 00:12:52.138
Death and mortality often live
in the shadow of an affair,

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.608
because they raise these questions.

00:12:54.632 --> 00:12:57.536
Is this it? Is there more?

00:12:57.901 --> 00:13:00.957
Am I going on for another
25 years like this?

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.362
Will I ever feel that thing again?

00:13:06.377 --> 00:13:10.788
And it has led me to think
that perhaps these questions

00:13:10.788 --> 00:13:13.947
are the ones that propel
people to cross the line,

00:13:13.947 --> 00:13:17.939
and that some affairs are
an attempt to beat back deadness,

00:13:17.939 --> 00:13:19.735
in an antidote to death.

00:13:21.999 --> 00:13:24.867
And contrary to what you may think,

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:29.903
affairs are way less about sex,
and a lot more about desire:

00:13:29.903 --> 00:13:33.392
desire for attention,
desire to feel special,

00:13:33.392 --> 00:13:35.308
desire to feel important.

00:13:36.237 --> 00:13:39.247
And the very structure of an affair,

00:13:39.247 --> 00:13:41.499
the fact that you can
never have your lover,

00:13:41.503 --> 00:13:42.938
keeps you wanting.

00:13:42.938 --> 00:13:45.959
That in itself is a desire machine,

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:48.747
because the incompleteness, the ambiguity,

00:13:48.747 --> 00:13:51.522
keeps you wanting
that which you can't have.

00:13:53.641 --> 00:13:55.177
Now some of you probably think

00:13:55.177 --> 00:13:58.807
that affairs don't happen
in open relationships,

00:13:58.807 --> 00:13:59.998
but they do.

00:14:00.432 --> 00:14:03.562
First of all, the conversation
about monogamy is not the same

00:14:03.562 --> 00:14:05.743
as the conversation about infidelity.

00:14:06.468 --> 00:14:09.959
But the fact is that it seems
that even when we have

00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:12.632
the freedom to have other sexual partners,

00:14:12.632 --> 00:14:16.720
we still seem to be lured
by the power of the forbidden,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.207
that if we do that which
we are not supposed to do,

00:14:20.207 --> 00:14:23.006
then we feel like we are really
doing what we want to.

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:28.935
And I've also told
quite a few of my patients

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:33.536
that if they could bring
into their relationships

00:14:33.536 --> 00:14:37.167
one tenth of the boldness,
the imagination and the verve

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.879
that they put into their affairs,

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:41.124
they probably would never need to see me.

00:14:41.148 --> 00:14:43.148
(Laughter)

00:14:44.362 --> 00:14:46.647
So how do we heal from an affair?

00:14:48.428 --> 00:14:50.347
Desire runs deep.

00:14:50.371 --> 00:14:52.242
Betrayal runs deep.

00:14:53.266 --> 00:14:54.821
But it can be healed.

00:14:55.999 --> 00:14:58.920
And some affairs are death knells

00:14:58.944 --> 00:15:01.682
for relationships that were
already dying on the vine.

00:15:02.753 --> 00:15:05.769
But others will jolt us
into new possibilities.

00:15:05.953 --> 00:15:07.936
The fact is, the majority of couples

00:15:07.936 --> 00:15:10.150
who have experienced
affairs stay together.

00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:13.399
But some of them will merely survive,

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:18.103
and others will actually be able
to turn a crisis into an opportunity.

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:22.460
They'll be able to turn this
into a generative experience.

00:15:22.484 --> 00:15:26.198
And I'm actually thinking even
more so for the deceived partner,

00:15:26.222 --> 00:15:27.558
who will often say,

00:15:27.558 --> 00:15:29.365
"You think I didn't want more?

00:15:29.365 --> 00:15:31.207
But I'm not the one who did it."

00:15:31.968 --> 00:15:34.110
But now that the affair is exposed,

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.244
they, too, get to claim more,

00:15:36.244 --> 00:15:38.886
and they no longer have
to uphold the status quo

00:15:38.886 --> 00:15:41.800
that may not have been working
for them that well, either.

00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:47.110
I've noticed that a lot of couples,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.251
in the immediate aftermath of an affair,

00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:53.587
because of this new disorder
that may actually lead to a new order,

00:15:53.587 --> 00:15:57.169
will have depths of conversations
with honesty and openness

00:15:57.169 --> 00:15:58.824
that they haven't had in decades.

00:15:59.743 --> 00:16:02.680
And, partners who were
sexually indifferent

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.279
find themselves suddenly
so lustfully voracious,

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.814
they don't know where it's coming from.

00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:12.521
Something about the fear
of loss will rekindle desire,

00:16:12.521 --> 00:16:15.840
and make way for an entirely
new kind of truth.

00:16:18.133 --> 00:16:21.004
So when an affair is exposed,

00:16:21.004 --> 00:16:24.165
what are some of the specific things
that couples can do?

00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:30.204
We know from trauma that healing begins

00:16:30.204 --> 00:16:34.196
when the perpetrator
acknowledges their wrongdoing.

00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:39.050
So for the partner who had the affair,

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.582
for Nick,

00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:42.387
one thing is to end the affair,

00:16:42.387 --> 00:16:47.109
but the other is the essential,
important act of expressing

00:16:47.109 --> 00:16:50.315
guilt and remorse for hurting his wife.

00:16:50.889 --> 00:16:52.264
But the truth is

00:16:52.264 --> 00:16:55.365
that I have noticed that quite a lot
of people who have affairs

00:16:55.365 --> 00:16:58.463
may feel terribly guilty
for hurting their partner,

00:16:58.463 --> 00:17:01.676
but they don't feel guilty
for the experience of the affair itself.

00:17:02.135 --> 00:17:03.976
And that distinction is important.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.856
And Nick, he needs to hold
vigil for the relationship.

00:17:09.253 --> 00:17:12.326
He needs to become, for a while,
the protector of the boundaries.

00:17:12.326 --> 00:17:14.949
It's his responsibility to bring it up,

00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:16.929
because if he thinks about it,

00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:19.939
he can relieve Heather from the obsession,

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:23.149
and from having to make sure
that the affair isn't forgotten,

00:17:23.149 --> 00:17:26.332
and that in itself
begins to restore trust.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:29.429
But for Heather,

00:17:29.429 --> 00:17:31.174
or deceived partners,

00:17:31.174 --> 00:17:36.512
it is essential to do things
that bring back a sense of self-worth,

00:17:36.512 --> 00:17:40.245
to surround oneself with love
and with friends and activities

00:17:40.249 --> 00:17:43.652
that give back joy
and meaning and identity.

00:17:43.936 --> 00:17:45.869
But even more important,

00:17:45.869 --> 00:17:50.772
is to curb the curiosity
to mine for the sordid details --

00:17:50.772 --> 00:17:52.969
Where were you? Where did you do it?

00:17:52.969 --> 00:17:55.991
How often? Is she better
than me in bed? --

00:17:55.991 --> 00:17:58.475
questions that only inflict more pain,

00:17:58.475 --> 00:17:59.959
and keep you awake at night.

00:18:00.674 --> 00:18:05.350
And instead, switch to what I call
the investigative questions,

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.650
the ones that mine
the meaning and the motives --

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:11.127
What did this affair mean for you?

00:18:11.127 --> 00:18:13.899
What were you able to express
or experience there

00:18:13.899 --> 00:18:16.154
that you could no longer do with me?

00:18:16.154 --> 00:18:19.186
What was it like for you
when you came home?

00:18:19.186 --> 00:18:22.585
What is it about us that you value?

00:18:22.585 --> 00:18:24.737
Are you pleased this is over?

00:18:26.404 --> 00:18:30.725
Every affair will redefine a relationship,

00:18:30.725 --> 00:18:33.607
and every couple will determine

00:18:33.607 --> 00:18:36.142
what the legacy of the affair will be.

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:41.411
But affairs are here to stay,
and they're not going away.

00:18:42.316 --> 00:18:44.959
And the dilemmas of love and desire,

00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:50.929
they don't yield just simple answers
of black and white and good and bad,

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:52.903
and victim and perpetrator.

00:18:54.221 --> 00:18:58.296
Betrayal in a relationship
comes in many forms.

00:18:58.296 --> 00:19:00.650
There are many ways
that we betray our partner:

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.819
with contempt, with neglect,

00:19:02.819 --> 00:19:05.292
with indifference, with violence.

00:19:05.999 --> 00:19:09.437
Sexual betrayal is only
one way to hurt a partner.

00:19:09.437 --> 00:19:12.041
In other words, the victim of an affair

00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:14.983
is not always the victim of the marriage.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.048
Now, you've listened to me,

00:19:20.048 --> 00:19:22.423
and I know what you're thinking:

00:19:22.423 --> 00:19:26.197
She has a French accent,
she must be pro-affair.

00:19:26.697 --> 00:19:29.999
(Laughter)

00:19:31.761 --> 00:19:33.265
So, you're wrong.

00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:35.174
I am not French.

00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:38.119
(Laughter)

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:41.023
(Applause)

00:19:41.602 --> 00:19:43.269
And I'm not pro-affair.

00:19:44.674 --> 00:19:49.058
But because I think that good
can come out of an affair,

00:19:49.058 --> 00:19:52.389
I have often been asked
this very strange question:

00:19:52.413 --> 00:19:54.150
Would I ever recommend it?

00:19:55.514 --> 00:19:58.505
Now, I would no more
recommend you have an affair

00:19:58.505 --> 00:20:01.049
than I would recommend you have cancer,

00:20:01.049 --> 00:20:03.752
and yet we know that people
who have been ill

00:20:03.752 --> 00:20:07.950
often talk about how their illness
has yielded them a new perspective.

00:20:08.569 --> 00:20:11.906
The main question that I've been asked
since I arrived at this conference

00:20:11.906 --> 00:20:15.417
when I said I would talk
about infidelity is, for or against?

00:20:16.488 --> 00:20:17.749
I said, "Yes."

00:20:18.162 --> 00:20:20.583
(Laughter)

00:20:21.868 --> 00:20:25.505
I look at affairs from a dual perspective:

00:20:25.505 --> 00:20:29.153
hurt and betrayal on one side,

00:20:29.153 --> 00:20:32.509
growth and self-discovery on the other --

00:20:32.509 --> 00:20:35.605
what it did to you,
and what it meant for me.

00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:41.289
And so when a couple comes to me
in the aftermath of an affair

00:20:41.289 --> 00:20:43.092
that has been revealed,

00:20:43.092 --> 00:20:45.420
I will often tell them this:

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.825
Today in the West,

00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:52.704
most of us are going to have
two or three relationships

00:20:52.704 --> 00:20:54.403
or marriages,

00:20:54.403 --> 00:20:57.538
and some of us are going
to do it with the same person.

00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:00.911
Your first marriage is over.

00:21:01.633 --> 00:21:04.474
Would you like to create
a second one together?

00:21:05.164 --> 00:21:06.595
Thank you.

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:13.253
(Applause)
