00:00:01.047 --> 00:00:03.039
I know what you're thinking:

00:00:03.063 --> 00:00:04.912
"Why does that guy get to sit down?"

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.073
That's because this is radio.

00:00:09.097 --> 00:00:12.497
(Music)

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:15.470
I tell radio stories about design,

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:17.269
and I report on all kinds of stories:

00:00:17.293 --> 00:00:21.840
buildings and toothbrushes,
mascots and wayfinding and fonts.

00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:25.849
My mission is to get people to engage
with the design that they care about

00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:28.929
so they begin to pay attention
to all forms of design.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.595
When you decode the world
with design intent in mind,

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:36.020
the world becomes kind of magical.

00:00:36.044 --> 00:00:38.341
Instead of seeing the broken things,

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:40.642
you see all the little bits of genius

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:45.146
that anonymous designers have sweated over
to make our lives better.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.481
And that's essentially
the definition of design:

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:50.615
making life better and providing joy.

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:53.516
And few things give me greater joy

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.700
than a well-designed flag.

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:57.746
(Laughter)

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.033
Yeah!

00:00:59.057 --> 00:01:01.255
(Applause)

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:03.757
Happy 50th anniversary
on your flag, Canada.

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:06.391
It is beautiful, gold standard.

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:07.748
Love it.

00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:09.794
I'm kind of obsessed with flags.

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:12.306
Sometimes I bring up the topic of flags,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.924
and people are like,
"I don't care about flags,"

00:01:15.948 --> 00:01:19.270
and then we start talking
about flags, and trust me,

00:01:19.294 --> 00:01:21.822
100 percent of people care about flags.

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:25.337
There's just something about them
that works on our emotions.

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:29.388
My family wrapped my Christmas presents
as flags this year,

00:01:29.412 --> 00:01:36.168
including the blue gift bag
that's dressed up as the flag of Scotland.

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.477
I put this picture online,
and sure enough,

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:41.466
within the first few minutes,
someone left a comment that said,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.945
"You can take that Scottish Saltire
and shove it up your ass."

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.697
(Laughter)

00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:49.019
See, people are passionate
about flags, you know?

00:01:49.043 --> 00:01:50.337
That's the way it is.

00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:51.900
What I love about flags

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:54.195
is that once you understand
the design of flags,

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.789
what makes a good flag,
what makes a bad flag,

00:01:56.813 --> 00:01:59.372
you can understand
the design of almost anything.

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:01.183
So what I'm going to do here is,

00:02:01.207 --> 00:02:04.743
I cracked open an episode
of my radio show,

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:07.837
"99% Invisible," and I'm going
to reconstruct it here on stage,

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.127
so when I press a button over here --

00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:12.026
Voice: S for Sound --

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.951
Roman Mars: It's going to make a sound,

00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:17.040
and so whenever you hear a sound
or a voice or a piece of music,

00:02:17.064 --> 00:02:18.751
it's because I pressed a button.

00:02:18.775 --> 00:02:20.855
Voice: Sound.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.161
RM: All right, got it? Here we go.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.185
Three, two.

00:02:27.825 --> 00:02:31.631
This is 99% Invisible. I'm Roman Mars.

00:02:34.944 --> 00:02:36.945
(Music)

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.575
Narrator: The five basic
principles of flag design.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.105
Roman Mars: According to the North
American Vexillological Association.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.935
Vexillological.

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.005
Ted Kaye: Vexillology
is the study of flags.

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.461
RM: It's that extra "lol"
that makes it sound weird.

00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:52.379
Narrator: Number one, keep it simple.

00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:55.688
The flag should be so simple
that a child can draw it from memory.

00:02:55.712 --> 00:02:57.663
RM: Before I moved to Chicago in 2005,

00:02:57.687 --> 00:03:00.187
I didn't even know cities
had their own flags.

00:03:00.211 --> 00:03:02.088
TK: Most larger cities do have flags.

00:03:02.112 --> 00:03:04.841
RM: Well, I didn't know that,
that's Ted Kaye, by the way.

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:06.040
TK: Hello.

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:08.474
RM: He's a flag expert,
he's a totally awesome guy.

00:03:08.498 --> 00:03:11.713
TK: I'm Ted Kaye, I have edited
a scholarly journal on flag studies,

00:03:11.737 --> 00:03:14.711
and I am currently involved
with the Portland Flag Association

00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:17.729
and the North American
Vexillological Association.

00:03:18.122 --> 00:03:21.099
RM: Ted literally wrote
the book on flag design.

00:03:21.123 --> 00:03:22.651
Narrator: "Good Flag, Bad Flag."

00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:25.371
RM: It's more of a pamphlet, really,
it's about 16 pages.

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:29.304
TK: Yes, it's called "Good Flag, Bad Flag:
How to Design a Great Flag."

00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:32.023
RM: And that first city flag
I discovered in Chicago

00:03:32.047 --> 00:03:33.294
is a beaut:

00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:36.843
white field, two horizontal blue stripes,

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:39.728
and four six-pointed red stars
down the middle.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:41.290
(Sound)

00:03:41.314 --> 00:03:43.575
Narrator: Number two,
use meaningful symbolism.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.651
TK: The blue stripes represent
the water, the river and the lake.

00:03:46.675 --> 00:03:48.879
Narrator: The flag's images,
colors or pattern

00:03:48.903 --> 00:03:50.626
should relate to what it symbolizes.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.435
TK: The red stars represent
significant events in Chicago's history.

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.163
RM: Namely, the founding of Fort Dearborn
on the future site of Chicago,

00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:01.022
the Great Chicago Fire,

00:04:01.046 --> 00:04:03.693
the World Columbian Exposition,
which everyone remembers

00:04:03.717 --> 00:04:05.511
because of the White City,

00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:09.951
and the Century of Progress Exposition,
which no one remembers at all.

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:12.962
Narrator: Number three,
use two to three basic colors.

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:16.454
TK: The basic rule for colors
is to use two to three colors

00:04:16.478 --> 00:04:21.452
from the standard color set:
red, white, blue, green, yellow and black.

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:24.468
RM: The design of the Chicago flag
has complete buy-in

00:04:24.492 --> 00:04:26.459
with an entire cross-section of the city.

00:04:26.483 --> 00:04:27.651
It is everywhere;

00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:30.239
every municipal building flies the flag.

00:04:30.263 --> 00:04:33.196
Whet Moser: There's probably
at least one store on every block

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.463
near where I work that sells
some sort of Chicago flag paraphernalia.

00:04:36.487 --> 00:04:38.894
RM: That's Whet Moser
from Chicago magazine.

00:04:38.918 --> 00:04:41.911
WM: Today, just for example,
I went to get a haircut,

00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:44.309
and when I sat down in the barber's chair,

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:48.780
there was a Chicago flag on the box
that the barber kept all his tools in,

00:04:48.804 --> 00:04:52.263
and then in the mirror, there was
a Chicago flag on the wall behind me.

00:04:52.287 --> 00:04:57.255
When I left, a guy passed me who had
a Chicago flag badge on his backpack.

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.342
RM: It's adaptable and remixable.

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:02.931
The six-pointed stars in particular
show up in all kinds of places.

00:05:02.955 --> 00:05:06.636
WM: The coffee I bought the other day
had a Chicago star on it.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.631
RM: It's a distinct symbol
of Chicago pride.

00:05:09.655 --> 00:05:13.352
TK: When a police officer
or a firefighter dies in Chicago,

00:05:13.376 --> 00:05:16.966
often it's not the flag
of the United States on his casket.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.888
It can be the flag of the city of Chicago.

00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:25.141
That's how deeply the flag has gotten
into the civic imagery of Chicago.

00:05:25.566 --> 00:05:29.251
RM: And it isn't just that people
love Chicago and therefore love the flag.

00:05:29.275 --> 00:05:34.767
I also think that people love Chicago more
because the flag is so cool.

00:05:35.154 --> 00:05:39.631
TK: A positive feedback loop there
between great symbolism and civic pride.

00:05:40.278 --> 00:05:43.508
RM: OK, so when I moved back
to San Francisco in 2008,

00:05:43.532 --> 00:05:44.901
I researched its flag,

00:05:44.925 --> 00:05:50.003
because I had never seen it
in the previous eight years I lived there.

00:05:50.027 --> 00:05:52.911
And I found it, I am sorry to say,

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:54.593
sadly lacking.

00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:58.321
(Laughter)

00:05:58.345 --> 00:05:59.495
I know.

00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:01.772
It hurts me, too.

00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:04.619
(Laughter)

00:06:04.643 --> 00:06:06.386
TK: Well, let me start from the top.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.196
Narrator: Number one, keep it simple.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.396
TK: Keeping it simple.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.994
Narrator: The flag should be so simple
that a child can draw it from memory.

00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:14.887
TK: It's a relatively complex flag.

00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:16.179
RM: OK, here we go, OK.

00:06:16.203 --> 00:06:18.888
The main component
of the San Francisco flag is a phoenix

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:21.121
representing the city
rising from the ashes

00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:24.187
after the devastating fires of the 1850s.

00:06:24.211 --> 00:06:26.971
TK: A powerful symbol for San Francisco.

00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:28.970
RM: I still don't really dig the phoenix.

00:06:28.994 --> 00:06:31.640
Design-wise, it manages
to both be too crude

00:06:31.664 --> 00:06:34.476
and have too many details
at the same time,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.191
which if you were trying for that,

00:06:36.215 --> 00:06:38.132
you wouldn't be able to do it,

00:06:38.156 --> 00:06:39.906
and it just looks bad at a distance,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.598
but having deep meaning
puts that element in the plus column.

00:06:43.622 --> 00:06:46.822
Behind the phoenix,
the background is mostly white,

00:06:46.846 --> 00:06:50.151
and then it has a substantial
gold border around it.

00:06:50.175 --> 00:06:52.844
TK: Which is a very attractive
design element.

00:06:53.295 --> 00:06:54.593
RM: I think it's OK, but --

00:06:54.617 --> 00:06:56.176
(Laughter)

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.196
here come the big no-nos of flag design.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.617
Narrator: Number four,
no lettering or seals.

00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:03.877
Never use writing of any kind.

00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:06.499
RM: Underneath the phoenix,
there's a motto on a ribbon

00:07:06.523 --> 00:07:09.478
that translates to
"Gold in peace, iron in war,"

00:07:09.502 --> 00:07:11.833
plus -- and this is the big problem --

00:07:11.857 --> 00:07:15.066
it says San Francisco across the bottom.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.925
TK: If you need to write the name
of what you're representing on your flag,

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:20.725
your symbolism has failed.

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:22.525
(Laughter)

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:24.553
(Applause)

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:28.518
RM: The United States flag
doesn't say "USA" across the front.

00:07:28.542 --> 00:07:31.699
In fact, country flags,
they tend to behave.

00:07:31.723 --> 00:07:35.010
Like, hats off to South Africa
and Turkey and Israel

00:07:35.034 --> 00:07:37.162
and Somalia and Japan and Gambia.

00:07:37.186 --> 00:07:39.704
There's a bunch
of really great country flags,

00:07:39.728 --> 00:07:43.959
but they obey good design principles
because the stakes are high.

00:07:43.983 --> 00:07:46.380
They're on the international stage.

00:07:46.404 --> 00:07:50.070
But city, state and regional flags
are another story.

00:07:51.058 --> 00:07:52.951
(Laughter)

00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:55.707
There is a scourge of bad flags --

00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:56.776
(Laughter)

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.308
and they must be stopped.

00:07:58.332 --> 00:07:59.491
(Laughter)

00:07:59.515 --> 00:08:00.737
(Applause)

00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:04.361
That is the truth and that is the dare.

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:08.244
The first step is to recognize
that we have a problem.

00:08:08.268 --> 00:08:10.908
(Laughter)

00:08:12.586 --> 00:08:15.309
A lot of people tend to think
that good design

00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:16.670
is just a matter of taste,

00:08:16.694 --> 00:08:19.716
and quite honestly,
sometimes it is, actually,

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.121
but sometimes it isn't, all right?

00:08:22.145 --> 00:08:23.295
(Laughter)

00:08:23.747 --> 00:08:26.859
Here's the full list of NAVA
flag design principles.

00:08:28.328 --> 00:08:30.982
Narrator: The five
basic principles of flag design.

00:08:31.006 --> 00:08:33.602
Narrator: Number one.
TK: Keep it simple.

00:08:33.626 --> 00:08:36.054
Narrator: Number two.
TK: Use meaningful symbolism.

00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:38.825
Narrator: Number three.
TK: Use two to three basic colors.

00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:41.145
Narrator: Number four.
TK: No lettering or seals.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.101
Narrator: Never use writing of any kind.

00:08:43.125 --> 00:08:45.317
TK: Because you can't
read that at a distance.

00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:47.504
Narrator: Number five.
TK: And be distinctive.

00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:50.202
RM: All the best flags tend
to stick to these principles.

00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:52.576
And like I said before,
most country flags are OK.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.762
But here's the thing:

00:08:53.786 --> 00:08:57.278
if you showed this list of principles
to any designer of almost anything,

00:08:57.302 --> 00:09:00.129
they would say these principles --
simplicity, deep meaning,

00:09:00.153 --> 00:09:02.883
having few colors
or being thoughtful about colors,

00:09:02.907 --> 00:09:05.159
uniqueness, don't have
writing you can't read --

00:09:05.183 --> 00:09:07.757
all those principles apply to them, too.

00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:12.852
But sadly, good design principles
are rarely invoked in US city flags.

00:09:12.876 --> 00:09:15.363
Our biggest problem
seems to be that fourth one.

00:09:15.387 --> 00:09:19.496
We just can't stop ourselves
from putting our names on our flags,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.391
or little municipal seals
with tiny writing on them.

00:09:23.415 --> 00:09:25.319
Here's the thing about municipal seals:

00:09:25.343 --> 00:09:28.104
They were designed
to be on pieces of paper

00:09:28.128 --> 00:09:29.332
where you can read them,

00:09:29.356 --> 00:09:32.509
not on flags 100 feet away
flapping in the breeze.

00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:34.404
So here's a bunch of flags again.

00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:37.616
Vexillologists call these SOBs:

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.058
Seals on a bedsheet --

00:09:39.082 --> 00:09:40.254
(Laughter)

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:43.156
and if you can't tell
what city they go to,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.047
yeah, that's exactly the problem,

00:09:45.071 --> 00:09:48.019
except for Anaheim,
apparently, they fixed it.

00:09:48.043 --> 00:09:50.144
(Laughter)

00:09:51.208 --> 00:09:53.541
These flags are everywhere in the US.

00:09:53.565 --> 00:09:55.734
The European equivalent
of the municipal seal

00:09:55.758 --> 00:09:57.504
is the city coat of arms ...

00:09:58.368 --> 00:10:01.549
and this is where we can learn
a lesson for how to do things right.

00:10:01.573 --> 00:10:03.750
So this is the city
coat of arms of Amsterdam.

00:10:03.774 --> 00:10:05.790
Now, if this were a United States city,

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.038
the flag would probably look like this.

00:10:08.062 --> 00:10:09.240
You know, yeah.

00:10:09.264 --> 00:10:10.497
(Laughter)

00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:12.571
But instead, the flag of Amsterdam

00:10:12.595 --> 00:10:14.348
looks like this.

00:10:15.546 --> 00:10:17.965
Rather than plopping
the whole coat of arms

00:10:17.989 --> 00:10:21.160
on a solid background and writing
"Amsterdam" below it,

00:10:21.184 --> 00:10:24.093
they just take the key elements
of the escutcheon, the shield,

00:10:24.117 --> 00:10:27.664
and they turn it into the most
badass city flag in the world.

00:10:27.688 --> 00:10:29.418
(Laughter)

00:10:29.442 --> 00:10:33.624
(Applause)

00:10:33.794 --> 00:10:36.006
And because it's so badass,

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.739
those flags and crosses
are found throughout Amsterdam,

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:41.193
just like Chicago, they're used.

00:10:41.955 --> 00:10:44.868
Even though seal-on-a-bedsheet flags
are particularly painful

00:10:44.892 --> 00:10:46.137
and offensive to me,

00:10:46.161 --> 00:10:48.740
nothing can quite prepare you

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:51.845
for one of the biggest train wrecks
in vexillological history.

00:10:51.869 --> 00:10:53.113
(Laughter)

00:10:53.137 --> 00:10:54.287
Are you ready?

00:10:54.815 --> 00:10:57.570
It's the flag of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

00:10:57.594 --> 00:11:04.594
(Laughter)

00:11:05.465 --> 00:11:09.435
I mean, it's distinctive,

00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:11.304
I'll give them that.

00:11:12.114 --> 00:11:14.767
Steve Kodis: It was adopted in 1955.

00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:16.070
RM: The city ran a contest

00:11:16.094 --> 00:11:19.489
and gathered a bunch of submissions
with all kinds of designs.

00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:23.720
SK: And an alderman
by the name of Fred Steffan

00:11:23.744 --> 00:11:30.051
cobbled together parts of the submissions
to make what is now the Milwaukee flag.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.045
RM: It's a kitchen sink flag.

00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:35.881
There's a gigantic gear
representing industry,

00:11:35.905 --> 00:11:38.156
there's a ship recognizing the port,

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.689
a giant stalk of wheat

00:11:39.713 --> 00:11:41.779
paying homage to the brewing industry.

00:11:41.803 --> 00:11:43.493
It's a hot mess,

00:11:43.517 --> 00:11:48.344
and Steve Kodis, a graphic designer
from Milwaukee, wants to change it.

00:11:48.368 --> 00:11:49.940
SK: It's really awful.

00:11:49.964 --> 00:11:53.387
It's a misstep on the city's behalf,

00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:55.153
to say the least.

00:11:55.617 --> 00:11:58.035
RM: But what puts
the Milwaukee flag over the top,

00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:00.139
almost to the point of self-parody,

00:12:00.163 --> 00:12:05.641
is on it is a picture of the Civil War
battle flag of the Milwaukee regiment.

00:12:06.109 --> 00:12:08.415
SK: So that's the final element in it

00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:10.826
that just makes it
that much more ridiculous,

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:15.525
that there is a flag design
within the Milwaukee flag.

00:12:15.549 --> 00:12:17.618
RM: On the flag. Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:17.642 --> 00:12:18.807
(Laughter)

00:12:18.831 --> 00:12:20.137
Yeah.

00:12:20.161 --> 00:12:21.869
(Music)

00:12:21.893 --> 00:12:24.284
Now, Milwaukee is a fantastic city.

00:12:24.308 --> 00:12:26.559
I've been there, I love it.

00:12:26.583 --> 00:12:28.859
The most depressing part
of this flag, though,

00:12:28.883 --> 00:12:31.980
is that there have been
two major redesign contests.

00:12:32.004 --> 00:12:34.175
The last one was held in 2001.

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:36.749
105 entries were received.

00:12:36.773 --> 00:12:39.541
TK: But in the end, the members
of the Milwaukee Arts Board

00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:43.094
decided that none of the new entries
were worthy of flying over the city.

00:12:43.118 --> 00:12:45.498
RM: They couldn't agree
to change that thing!

00:12:45.522 --> 00:12:46.751
(Laughter)

00:12:46.775 --> 00:12:48.837
That's discouraging enough
to make you think

00:12:48.861 --> 00:12:52.260
that good design and democracy
just simply do not go together.

00:12:52.284 --> 00:12:53.438
(Laughter)

00:12:53.462 --> 00:12:56.291
But Steve Kotas is going
to try one more time

00:12:56.315 --> 00:12:58.477
to redesign the Milwaukee flag.

00:12:59.188 --> 00:13:01.149
SK: I believe Milwaukee is a great city.

00:13:01.173 --> 00:13:03.826
Every great city deserves a great flag.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.551
RM: Steve isn't ready
to reveal his design yet.

00:13:06.575 --> 00:13:09.097
One of the things about
proposing one of these things

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:10.793
is you have to get people on board,

00:13:10.817 --> 00:13:12.383
and then you reveal your design.

00:13:12.407 --> 00:13:13.697
But here's the trick:

00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:15.409
If you want to design a great flag,

00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:19.274
a kick-ass flag like Chicago's or DC's,
which also has a great flag,

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:22.136
start by drawing
a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.504
on a piece of paper.

00:13:23.528 --> 00:13:26.026
Your design has to fit
within that tiny rectangle.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.264
Here's why.

00:13:27.288 --> 00:13:32.326
TK: A three-by-five-foot flag
on a pole 100 feet away

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:38.971
looks about the same size
as a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle

00:13:38.995 --> 00:13:41.574
seen about 15 inches from your eye.

00:13:41.598 --> 00:13:45.735
You'd be surprised by how compelling
and simple the design can be

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:48.410
when you hold yourself to that limitation.

00:13:49.102 --> 00:13:51.862
RM: Meanwhile, back in San Francisco.

00:13:51.886 --> 00:13:53.528
Is there anything we can do?

00:13:54.697 --> 00:13:58.647
TK: I like to say that in every bad flag
there's a good flag trying to get out.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:01.119
The way to make
San Francisco's flag a good flag

00:14:01.143 --> 00:14:04.674
is to take the motto off
because you can't read that at a distance.

00:14:04.698 --> 00:14:06.202
Take the name off,

00:14:06.226 --> 00:14:10.459
and the border might even be made thicker,
so it's more a part of the flag.

00:14:10.483 --> 00:14:12.336
And I would simply take the phoenix

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.737
and make it a great big element
in the middle of the flag.

00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:18.582
RM: But the current phoenix,
that's got to go.

00:14:18.606 --> 00:14:22.012
TK: I would simplify
or stylize the phoenix.

00:14:22.036 --> 00:14:24.271
Depict a big, wide-winged bird

00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:25.928
coming out of flames.

00:14:25.952 --> 00:14:27.755
Emphasize those flames.

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:30.622
RM: So this San Francisco flag
was designed by Frank Chimero

00:14:30.646 --> 00:14:32.184
based on Ted Kaye's suggestions.

00:14:32.208 --> 00:14:35.067
I don't know what he would do
if we was completely unfettered

00:14:35.091 --> 00:14:36.775
and didn't follow those guidelines.

00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:40.065
Fans of my radio show and podcast,
heard me complain about bad flags.

00:14:40.089 --> 00:14:42.012
They've sent me other suggested designs.

00:14:42.036 --> 00:14:43.795
This one's by Neil Mussett.

00:14:43.819 --> 00:14:46.863
Both are so much better.

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:48.315
(Laughter)

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:50.268
And I think if they were adopted,

00:14:50.292 --> 00:14:52.612
I would see them around the city.

00:14:53.135 --> 00:14:56.329
In my crusade to make
flags of the world more beautiful,

00:14:56.353 --> 00:14:58.449
many listeners have taken it
upon themselves

00:14:58.473 --> 00:15:00.959
to redesign their flags
and look into the feasibility

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:03.015
of getting them officially adopted.

00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:04.292
(Music)

00:15:04.316 --> 00:15:06.947
If you see your city flag and like it,

00:15:06.971 --> 00:15:08.189
fly it,

00:15:08.213 --> 00:15:10.263
even if it violates a design rule or two.

00:15:10.287 --> 00:15:11.658
I don't care.

00:15:11.682 --> 00:15:13.842
But if you don't see your city flag,

00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:17.036
maybe it doesn't exist, but maybe it does,

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.376
and it just sucks,

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.007
and I dare you to join the effort
to try to change that.

00:15:23.867 --> 00:15:26.459
As we move more and more into cities,

00:15:26.483 --> 00:15:31.378
the city flag will become
not just a symbol of that city as a place,

00:15:31.402 --> 00:15:37.685
but also, it could become a symbol
of how that city considers design itself,

00:15:37.709 --> 00:15:40.934
especially today, as the populace
is becoming more design-aware.

00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.966
And I think design awareness
is at an all-time high.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:48.021
A well-designed flag could be seen
as an indicator of how a city

00:15:48.045 --> 00:15:50.650
considers all of its design systems:

00:15:50.674 --> 00:15:52.282
its public transit,

00:15:52.306 --> 00:15:54.279
its parks, its signage.

00:15:54.303 --> 00:15:56.892
It might seem frivolous, but it's not.

00:15:57.857 --> 00:15:59.693
TK: Often when city leaders say,

00:15:59.717 --> 00:16:04.193
"We have more important things to do
than worry about a city flag,"

00:16:04.217 --> 00:16:05.816
my response is,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.420
"If you had a great city flag,

00:16:07.444 --> 00:16:10.160
you would have a banner
for people to rally under

00:16:10.184 --> 00:16:12.591
to face those more important things."

00:16:13.781 --> 00:16:14.931
(Music)

00:16:14.955 --> 00:16:17.387
RM: I've seen firsthand
what a good city flag can do

00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:18.700
in the case of Chicago.

00:16:18.724 --> 00:16:21.311
The marriage of good design
and civic pride

00:16:21.335 --> 00:16:23.827
is something that we need in all places.

00:16:23.851 --> 00:16:27.703
The best part about municipal flags
is that we own them.

00:16:27.727 --> 00:16:29.278
They are an open-source,

00:16:29.302 --> 00:16:32.967
publicly owned design language
of the community.

00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:34.384
When they are done well,

00:16:34.408 --> 00:16:38.653
they are remixable, adaptable,
and they are powerful.

00:16:38.677 --> 00:16:41.092
We could control the branding
and graphical imagery

00:16:41.116 --> 00:16:42.716
of our cities with a good flag,

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.415
but instead, by having
bad flags we don't use,

00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:48.385
we cede that territory to sports teams

00:16:48.409 --> 00:16:50.812
and chambers of commerce
and tourism boards.

00:16:50.836 --> 00:16:53.333
Sports teams can leave
and break our hearts.

00:16:53.357 --> 00:16:56.441
And besides, some of us
don't really care about sports.

00:16:56.465 --> 00:16:59.142
And tourism campaigns can just be cheesy.

00:16:59.725 --> 00:17:01.248
But a great city flag

00:17:01.272 --> 00:17:03.662
is something that represents
a city to its people

00:17:03.686 --> 00:17:05.845
and its people to the world at large.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.304
And when that flag is a beautiful thing,

00:17:08.328 --> 00:17:10.427
that connection is a beautiful thing.

00:17:11.219 --> 00:17:14.697
So maybe all the city flags
can be as inspiring as Hong Kong

00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:16.873
or Portland or Trondheim,

00:17:16.897 --> 00:17:18.880
and we can do away with all the bad flags

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:22.803
like San Francisco, Milwaukee,
Cedar Rapids,

00:17:22.827 --> 00:17:25.466
and finally, when we're all done,

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.305
we can do something
about Pocatello, Idaho,

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:32.026
considered by the North American
Vexillological Association

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.449
as the worst city flag in North America.

00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:37.346
[Proud to be Pocatello]

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.926
(Laughter)

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.872
(Applause)

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:45.047
Yeah.

00:17:45.071 --> 00:17:46.221
(Applause)
