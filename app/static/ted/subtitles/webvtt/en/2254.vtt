00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.550
I'd like to have you look at this pencil.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.407
It's a thing. It's a legal thing.

00:00:06.407 --> 00:00:09.379
And so are books you might have
or the cars you own.

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:12.258
They're all legal things.

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:15.881
The great apes that you'll see behind me,

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:19.549
they too are legal things.

00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:23.822
Now, I can do that to a legal thing.

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:26.631
I can do whatever I want
to my book or my car.

00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:29.533
These great apes, you'll see.

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:33.420
The photographs are taken by a man
named James Mollison

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.464
who wrote a book called
"James &amp; Other Apes."

00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:39.227
And he tells in his book
how every single one them,

00:00:39.227 --> 00:00:41.525
almost every one of them, is an orphan

00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:45.140
who saw his mother and father
die before his eyes.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.748
They're legal things.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:50.441
So for centuries, there's been
a great legal wall

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:53.785
that separates legal things
from legal persons.

00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:57.570
On one hand, legal things
are invisible to judges.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.520
They don't count in law.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.215
They don't have any legal rights.

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:03.699
They don't have
the capacity for legal rights.

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.836
They are the slaves.

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.660
On the other side of that legal wall
are the legal persons.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.097
Legal persons are very visible to judges.

00:01:11.607 --> 00:01:13.312
They count in law.

00:01:13.312 --> 00:01:15.239
They may have many rights.

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:18.142
They have the capacity
for an infinite number of rights.

00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:20.510
And they're the masters.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.779
Right now, all nonhuman animals
are legal things.

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:28.660
All human beings are legal persons.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.469
But being human and being a legal person

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:37.112
has never been, and is not today,
synonymous with a legal person.

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:40.478
Humans and legal persons
are not synonymous.

00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:43.358
On the one side,

00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:47.491
there have been many human beings
over the centuries

00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:49.464
who have been legal things.

00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:50.997
Slaves were legal things.

00:01:50.997 --> 00:01:54.719
Women, children,
were sometimes legal things.

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:59.146
Indeed, a great deal of civil rights
struggle over the last centuries

00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:03.659
has been to punch a hole
through that wall and begin to feed

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.713
these human things through the wall
and have them become legal persons.

00:02:08.713 --> 00:02:12.182
But alas, that hole has closed up.

00:02:12.772 --> 00:02:14.819
Now, on the other side are legal persons,

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.952
but they've never only been
limited to human beings.

00:02:18.952 --> 00:02:22.940
There are, for example, there are many
legal persons who are not even alive.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.547
In the United States,

00:02:24.547 --> 00:02:28.540
we're aware of the fact
that corporations are legal persons.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.515
In pre-independence India,

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:33.139
a court held that a Hindu idol
was a legal person,

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.200
that a mosque was a legal person.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.630
In 2000, the Indian Supreme Court

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.173
held that the holy books
of the Sikh religion was a legal person,

00:02:41.173 --> 00:02:43.472
and in 2012, just recently,

00:02:43.472 --> 00:02:47.233
there was a treaty between
the indigenous peoples of New Zealand

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:50.484
and the crown, in which it was agreed
that a river was a legal person

00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:53.525
who owned its own riverbed.

00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:56.776
Now, I read Peter Singer's book in 1980,

00:02:56.776 --> 00:03:00.500
when I had a full head
of lush, brown hair,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.088
and indeed I was moved by it,

00:03:03.088 --> 00:03:06.616
because I had become a lawyer because
I wanted to speak for the voiceless,

00:03:06.616 --> 00:03:07.851
defend the defenseless,

00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:12.263
and I'd never realized how voiceless
and defenseless the trillions,

00:03:12.263 --> 00:03:15.769
billions of nonhuman animals are.

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.788
And I began to work
as an animal protection lawyer.

00:03:18.788 --> 00:03:23.664
And by 1985, I realized that I was trying
to accomplish something

00:03:23.664 --> 00:03:25.591
that was literally impossible,

00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:28.215
the reason being that all of my clients,

00:03:28.215 --> 00:03:31.697
all the animals whose interests
I was trying to defend,

00:03:31.697 --> 00:03:34.182
were legal things; they were invisible.

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:36.102
It was not going to work, so I decided

00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:40.066
that the only thing that was going to work
was they had, at least some of them,

00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:43.864
had to also be moved through a hole
that we could open up again in that wall

00:03:43.864 --> 00:03:47.440
and begin feeding the appropriate
nonhuman animals through that hole

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.986
onto the other side
of being legal persons.

00:03:50.986 --> 00:03:56.426
Now, at that time, there was
very little known about or spoken about

00:03:56.426 --> 00:03:58.794
truly animal rights,

00:03:58.794 --> 00:04:03.235
about the idea of having legal personhood
or legal rights for a nonhuman animal,

00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:06.005
and I knew it was going
to take a long time.

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:09.405
And so, in 1985, I figured that it
would take about 30 years

00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:12.934
before we'd be able to even begin
a strategic litigation,

00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:18.716
long-term campaign, in order to be able
to punch another hole through that wall.

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:24.556
It turned out that I was pessimistic,
that it only took 28.

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:33.240
So what we had to do in order
to begin was not only

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.922
to write law review articles
and teach classes, write books,

00:04:37.922 --> 00:04:40.890
but we had to then begin
to get down to the nuts and bolts

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.875
of how you litigate that kind of case.

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:46.908
So one of the first things we needed to do
was figure out what a cause of action was,

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:48.367
a legal cause of action.

00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:51.264
And a legal cause of action
is a vehicle that lawyers use

00:04:51.264 --> 00:04:56.840
to put their arguments in front of courts.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.744
It turns out there's
a very interesting case

00:04:59.744 --> 00:05:04.348
that had occurred almost 250 years ago
in London called Somerset vs. Stewart,

00:05:04.348 --> 00:05:07.444
whereby a black slave
had used the legal system

00:05:07.444 --> 00:05:10.323
and had moved from a legal thing
to a legal person.

00:05:10.323 --> 00:05:14.386
I was so interested in it that I
eventually wrote an entire book about it.

00:05:14.386 --> 00:05:19.773
James Somerset was an eight-year-old boy
when he was kidnapped from West Africa.

00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:22.720
He survived the Middle Passage,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.894
and he was sold to a Scottish businessman
named Charles Stewart in Virginia.

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:32.102
Now, 20 years later, Stewart
brought James Somerset to London,

00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:35.980
and after he got there, James decided
he was going to escape.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.620
And so one of the first things he did
was to get himself baptized,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.901
because he wanted to get
a set of godparents,

00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:43.712
because to an 18th-century slave,

00:05:43.712 --> 00:05:46.870
they knew that one of the major
responsibilities of godfathers

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.982
was to help you escape.

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:52.998
And so in the fall of 1771,

00:05:52.998 --> 00:05:55.641
James Somerset had a confrontation
with Charles Stewart.

00:05:55.641 --> 00:06:00.313
We don't know exactly what happened,
but then James dropped out of sight.

00:06:00.313 --> 00:06:03.309
An enraged Charles Stewart
then hired slave catchers

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:05.550
to canvass the city of London,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.150
find him, bring him
not back to Charles Stewart,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.173
but to a ship, the Ann and Mary,
that was floating in London Harbour,

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.793
and he was chained to the deck,

00:06:15.793 --> 00:06:17.797
and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica

00:06:17.797 --> 00:06:20.816
where James was to be sold
in the slave markets

00:06:20.816 --> 00:06:24.299
and be doomed to the three to five
years of life that a slave had

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:27.150
harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.359
Well now James' godparents
swung into action.

00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:32.866
They approached the most powerful judge,

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:36.512
Lord Mansfield, who was chief judge
of the court of King's Bench,

00:06:36.512 --> 00:06:40.157
and they demanded that he issue
a common law writ of habeus corpus

00:06:40.157 --> 00:06:41.991
on behalf of James Somerset.

00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:45.962
Now, the common law is the kind of law
that English-speaking judges can make

00:06:45.962 --> 00:06:50.099
when they're not cabined in
by statutes or constitutions,

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.695
and a writ of habeus corpus
is called the Great Writ,

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:54.762
capital G, capital W,

00:06:54.762 --> 00:06:59.290
and it's meant to protect any of us
who are detained against our will.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.263
A writ of habeus corpus is issued.

00:07:01.263 --> 00:07:03.701
The detainer is required
to bring the detainee in

00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:09.576
and give a legally sufficient reason
for depriving him of his bodily liberty.

00:07:09.576 --> 00:07:14.570
Well, Lord Mansfield had to make
a decision right off the bat,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.354
because if James Somerset
was a legal thing,

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:20.419
he was not eligible
for a writ of habeus corpus,

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.439
only if he could be a legal person.

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.457
So Lord Mansfield decided
that he would assume,

00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:29.560
without deciding, that James Somerset
was indeed a legal person,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.971
and he issued the writ of habeus corpus,
and James's body was brought in

00:07:32.971 --> 00:07:34.482
by the captain of the ship.

00:07:34.482 --> 00:07:37.183
There were a series of hearings
over the next six months.

00:07:37.183 --> 00:07:43.011
On June 22, 1772, Lord Mansfield
said that slavery was so odious,

00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:44.845
and he used the word "odious,"

00:07:44.845 --> 00:07:48.723
that the common law would not support it,
and he ordered James free.

00:07:48.723 --> 00:07:52.313
At that moment, James Somerset
underwent a legal transubstantiation.

00:07:52.883 --> 00:07:54.943
The free man who walked
out of the courtroom

00:07:54.943 --> 00:07:57.191
looked exactly like the slave
who had walked in,

00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:02.330
but as far as the law was concerned,
they had nothing whatsoever in common.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.740
The next thing we did is that
the Nonhuman Rights Project,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.250
which I founded, then began to look at
what kind of values and principles

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.128
do we want to put before the judges?

00:08:12.128 --> 00:08:16.007
What values and principles
did they imbibe with their mother's milk,

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:19.090
were they taught in law school,
do they use every day,

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.779
do they believe with all their hearts --
and we chose liberty and equality.

00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:25.811
Now, liberty right is the kind of right
to which you're entitled


00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:28.152
because of how you're put together,

00:08:28.152 --> 00:08:33.489
and a fundamental liberty right
protects a fundamental interest.

00:08:33.489 --> 00:08:36.724
And the supreme interest in the common law

00:08:36.724 --> 00:08:40.765
are the rights to autonomy
and self-determination.

00:08:42.015 --> 00:08:45.795
So they are so powerful that
in a common law country,

00:08:45.795 --> 00:08:50.393
if you go to a hospital and you refuse
life-saving medical treatment,

00:08:50.393 --> 00:08:52.640
a judge will not order it forced upon you,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.451
because they will respect
your self-determination and your autonomy.

00:08:57.451 --> 00:09:00.714
Now, an equality right is the kind
of right to which you're entitled

00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:03.610
because you resemble someone else
in a relevant way,

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.601
and there's the rub, relevant way.

00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:09.339
So if you are that, then because
they have the right, you're like them,

00:09:09.339 --> 00:09:11.684
you're entitled to the right.

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:14.306
Now, courts and legislatures
draw lines all the time.

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:17.118
Some are included, some are excluded.

00:09:17.118 --> 00:09:23.260
But you have to,
at the bare minimum you must --

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.695
that line has to be a reasonable means
to a legitimate end.

00:09:27.695 --> 00:09:30.435
The Nonhuman Rights Project
argues that drawing a line

00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:33.742
in order to enslave an autonomous
and self-determining being

00:09:33.742 --> 00:09:35.530
like you're seeing behind me,

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.560
that that's a violation of equality.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.820
We then searched through 80 jurisdictions,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.065
it took us seven years,
to find the jurisdiction

00:09:44.065 --> 00:09:46.271
where we wanted to begin
filing our first suit.

00:09:46.271 --> 00:09:47.770
We chose the state of New York.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.392
Then we decided upon
who our plaintiffs are going to be.

00:09:50.392 --> 00:09:52.258
We decided upon chimpanzees,

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:55.109
not just because Jane Goodall
was on our board of directors,

00:09:55.109 --> 00:09:58.862
but because they, Jane and others,

00:09:58.862 --> 00:10:01.582
have studied chimpanzees
intensively for decades.

00:10:01.582 --> 00:10:05.158
We know the extraordinary
cognitive capabilities that they have,

00:10:05.158 --> 00:10:08.292
and they also resemble the kind
that human beings have.

00:10:08.292 --> 00:10:13.424
And so we chose chimpanzees,
and we began to then canvass the world

00:10:13.424 --> 00:10:16.256
to find the experts
in chimpanzee cognition.

00:10:16.256 --> 00:10:20.761
We found them in Japan, Sweden, Germany,
Scotland, England and the United States,

00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:23.524
and amongst them, they wrote
100 pages of affidavits

00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:26.320
in which they set out more than 40 ways

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.120
in which their complex
cognitive capability,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.140
either individually or together,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.259
all added up to autonomy
and self-determination.

00:10:35.429 --> 00:10:38.936
Now, these included, for example,
that they were conscious.

00:10:38.936 --> 00:10:41.283
But they're also conscious
that they're conscious.

00:10:41.283 --> 00:10:44.139
They know they have a mind.
They know that others have minds.

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:46.682
They know they're individuals,
and that they can live.

00:10:46.682 --> 00:10:49.975
They understand that they lived yesterday
and they will live tomorrow.

00:10:49.975 --> 00:10:53.419
They engage in mental time travel.
They remember what happened yesterday.

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:54.870
They can anticipate tomorrow,

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.587
which is why it's so terrible to imprison
a chimpanzee, especially alone.

00:10:59.587 --> 00:11:02.184
It's the thing that we do
to our worst criminals,

00:11:02.184 --> 00:11:06.955
and we do that to chimpanzees
without even thinking about it.

00:11:07.715 --> 00:11:10.426
They have some kind of moral capacity.

00:11:10.426 --> 00:11:13.352
When they play economic games
with human beings,

00:11:13.352 --> 00:11:17.392
they'll spontaneously make fair offers,
even when they're not required to do so.

00:11:17.392 --> 00:11:19.425
They are numerate.
They understand numbers.

00:11:19.425 --> 00:11:20.805
They can do some simple math.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:24.869
They can engage in language --
or to stay out of the language wars,

00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:28.234
they're involved in intentional
and referential communication

00:11:28.234 --> 00:11:30.721
in which they pay attention
to the attitudes of those

00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:32.252
with whom they are speaking.

00:11:32.252 --> 00:11:33.710
They have culture.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.501
They have a material culture,
a social culture.

00:11:36.501 --> 00:11:38.916
They have a symbolic culture.

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:42.817
Scientists in the Taï Forests
in the Ivory Coast

00:11:42.817 --> 00:11:46.346
found chimpanzees who were using
these rocks to smash open

00:11:46.346 --> 00:11:49.132
the incredibly hard hulls of nuts.

00:11:49.132 --> 00:11:51.431
It takes a long time
to learn how to do that,

00:11:51.431 --> 00:11:53.544
and they excavated the area
and they found

00:11:53.544 --> 00:11:56.377
that this material culture,
this way of doing it,

00:11:56.377 --> 00:11:59.720
these rocks, had passed down
for at least 4,300 years

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.712
through 225 chimpanzee generations.

00:12:04.712 --> 00:12:07.104
So now we needed to find our chimpanzee.

00:12:07.104 --> 00:12:10.284
Our chimpanzee,

00:12:10.284 --> 00:12:13.187
first we found two of them
in the state of New York.

00:12:13.187 --> 00:12:16.391
Both of them would die before
we could even get our suits filed.

00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:18.272
Then we found Tommy.

00:12:18.272 --> 00:12:21.384
Tommy is a chimpanzee.
You see him behind me.

00:12:21.384 --> 00:12:23.891
Tommy was a chimpanzee.
We found him in that cage.

00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:27.351
We found him in a small room
that was filled with cages

00:12:27.351 --> 00:12:32.537
in a larger warehouse structure on a used
trailer lot in central New York.

00:12:32.537 --> 00:12:34.711
We found Kiko, who is partially deaf.

00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:40.353
Kiko was in the back of a cement
storefront in western Massachusetts.

00:12:40.353 --> 00:12:42.250
And we found Hercules and Leo.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.953
They're two young male chimpanzees

00:12:43.953 --> 00:12:47.366
who are being used for biomedical,
anatomical research at Stony Brook.

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:48.671
We found them.

00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:51.383
And so on the last week of December 2013,

00:12:51.383 --> 00:12:55.323
the Nonhuman Rights Project filed three
suits all across the state of New York

00:12:55.323 --> 00:12:58.801
using the same common law
writ of habeus corpus argument

00:12:58.801 --> 00:13:01.529
that had been used with James Somerset,

00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:06.616
and we demanded that the judges issue
these common law writs of habeus corpus.

00:13:06.616 --> 00:13:08.727
We wanted the chimpanzees out,

00:13:08.727 --> 00:13:11.513
and we wanted them brought
to Save the Chimps,

00:13:11.513 --> 00:13:15.461
a tremendous chimpanzee
sanctuary in South Florida

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:20.548
which involves an artificial lake
with 12 or 13 islands --

00:13:20.548 --> 00:13:23.411
there are two or three acres
where two dozen chimpanzees live

00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:24.571
on each of them.

00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:27.521
And these chimpanzees would then live
the life of a chimpanzee,

00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:31.923
with other chimpanzees in an environment
that was as close to Africa as possible.

00:13:31.923 --> 00:13:35.870
Now, all these cases are still going on.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.902
We have not yet run into
our Lord Mansfield.

00:13:40.622 --> 00:13:42.230
We shall. We shall.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.110
This is a long-term strategic
litigation campaign. We shall.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.225
And to quote Winston Churchill,

00:13:48.225 --> 00:13:52.393
the way we view our cases
is that they're not the end,

00:13:52.393 --> 00:13:54.436
they're not even the beginning of the end,

00:13:54.436 --> 00:13:57.950
but they are perhaps
the end of the beginning.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.497
Thank you.

00:14:00.497 --> 00:14:04.497
(Applause)
