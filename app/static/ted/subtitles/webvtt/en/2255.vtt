00:00:01.461 --> 00:00:07.177
So if I told you that
this was the face of pure joy,

00:00:07.177 --> 00:00:09.968
would you call me crazy?

00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:11.918
I wouldn't blame you,

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:16.172
because every time I look at this
Arctic selfie, I shiver just a little bit.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.919
I want to tell you
a little bit about this photograph.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.485
I was swimming around
in the Lofoten Islands in Norway,

00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:25.190
just inside the Arctic Circle,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.348
and the water was hovering
right at freezing.

00:00:28.348 --> 00:00:32.179
The air? A brisk -10 with windchill,

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:35.615
and I could literally feel the blood
trying to leave my hands,

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:40.375
feet and face, and rush
to protect my vital organs.

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:42.149
It was the coldest I've ever been.

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:47.921
But even with swollen lips, sunken eyes,
and cheeks flushed red,

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:53.867
I have found that this place right here
is somewhere I can find great joy.

00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:57.627
Now, when it comes to pain,
psychologist Brock Bastian

00:00:57.627 --> 00:00:59.972
probably said it best when he wrote,

00:00:59.972 --> 00:01:02.549
"Pain is a kind of shortcut
to mindfulness.

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.218
It makes us suddenly aware
of everything in the environment.

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:08.192
It brutally draws us in

00:01:08.192 --> 00:01:12.718
to a virtual sensory awareness
of the world much like meditation."

00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:16.537
If shivering is a form of meditation,
then I would consider myself a monk.

00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:17.387
(Laughter)

00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:20.266
Now, before we get into the why

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:23.981
would anyone ever want to surf
in freezing cold water?

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:26.558
I would love to give you
a little perspective

00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:29.162
on what a day in my life can look like.

00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:35.799
(Music)

00:02:16.017 --> 00:02:19.544
(Video) Man: I mean, I know
we were hoping for good waves,

00:02:19.544 --> 00:02:22.424
but I don't think anybody thought
that was going to happen.

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:24.095
I can't stop shaking.

00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:25.919
I am so cold.

00:02:28.344 --> 00:02:31.432
(Music)

00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:34.185
(Applause)

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:39.804
Chris Burkard: So,
surf photographer, right?

00:02:39.804 --> 00:02:42.708
I don't even know
if it's a real job title, to be honest.

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:44.844
My parents definitely didn't think so

00:02:44.844 --> 00:02:49.718
when I told them at 19 I was quitting
my job to pursue this dream career:

00:02:49.718 --> 00:02:54.294
blue skies, warm tropical beaches,
and a tan that lasts all year long.

00:02:54.294 --> 00:02:58.125
I mean, to me, this was it.
Life could not get any better.

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:02.769
Sweating it out, shooting surfers
in these exotic tourist destinations.

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.510
But there was just this one problem.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.109
You see, the more time I spent traveling
to these exotic locations,

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.534
the less gratifying it seemed to be.

00:03:11.104 --> 00:03:14.909
I set out seeking adventure,
and what I was finding was only routine.

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:20.439
It was things like wi-fi, TV, fine dining,
and a constant cellular connection

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.411
that to me were all the trappings
of places heavily touristed

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.709
in and out of the water,

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.376
and it didn't take long
for me to start feeling suffocated.

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:35.223
I began craving wild, open spaces,

00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:38.665
and so I set out to find the places
others had written off

00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:42.543
as too cold, too remote,
and too dangerous to surf,

00:03:42.543 --> 00:03:45.353
and that challenge intrigued me.

00:03:45.353 --> 00:03:49.485
I began this sort of personal crusade
against the mundane,

00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:52.109
because if there's
one thing I've realized,

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.961
it's that any career,

00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:57.722
even one as seemingly glamorous
as surf photography,

00:03:57.722 --> 00:04:00.148
has the danger of becoming monotonous.

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:03.702
So in my search to break up
this monotony, I realized something:

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:06.656
There's only about a third
of the Earth's oceans that are warm,

00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:09.587
and it's really just that thin band
around the equator.

00:04:09.587 --> 00:04:12.095
So if I was going to find perfect waves,

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:14.672
it was probably going
to happen somewhere cold,

00:04:14.672 --> 00:04:16.553
where the seas are notoriously rough,

00:04:16.553 --> 00:04:19.246
and that's exactly where I began to look.

00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:21.777
And it was my first trip to Iceland

00:04:21.777 --> 00:04:24.496
that I felt like I found
exactly what I was looking for.

00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:28.023
I was blown away
by the natural beauty of the landscape,

00:04:28.023 --> 00:04:32.219
but most importantly, I couldn't believe
we were finding perfect waves

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.229
in such a remote and rugged
part of the world.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.915
At one point, we got to the beach

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:41.018
only to find massive chunks of ice
had piled on the shoreline.

00:04:41.018 --> 00:04:43.371
They created this barrier
between us and the surf,

00:04:43.371 --> 00:04:45.761
and we had to weave 
through this thing like a maze

00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:47.348
just to get out into the lineup.

00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:48.473
and once we got there,

00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:51.511
we were pushing aside these ice chunks
trying to get into waves.

00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:55.468
It was an incredible experience,
one I'll never forget,

00:04:55.468 --> 00:04:58.254
because amidst those harsh conditions,

00:04:58.254 --> 00:05:02.976
I felt like I stumbled onto
one of the last quiet places,

00:05:02.976 --> 00:05:05.991
somewhere that I found a clarity
and a connection with the world

00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:08.913
I knew I would never find
on a crowded beach.

00:05:10.073 --> 00:05:13.231
I was hooked. I was hooked. (Laughter)

00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:16.087
Cold water was constantly on my mind,

00:05:16.087 --> 00:05:17.399
and from that point on,

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:20.729
my career focused on these types of harsh
and unforgiving environments,

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.605
and it took me to places like Russia,
Norway, Alaska, Iceland, Chile,

00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:27.534
the Faroe Islands,
and a lot of places in between.

00:05:27.534 --> 00:05:30.552
And one of my favorite things
about these places

00:05:30.552 --> 00:05:34.453
was simply the challenge and
the creativity it took just to get there:

00:05:34.453 --> 00:05:36.659
hours, days, weeks spent on Google Earth

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.828
trying to pinpoint any remote stretch
of beach or reef we could actually get to.

00:05:41.418 --> 00:05:44.848
And once we got there,
the vehicles were just as creative:

00:05:44.848 --> 00:05:47.757
snowmobiles, six-wheel
Soviet troop carriers,

00:05:47.757 --> 00:05:51.054
and a couple of super-sketchy
helicopter flights.

00:05:51.054 --> 00:05:53.260
(Laughter)

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.920
Helicopters really scare me, by the way.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.042
There was this one particularly
bumpy boat ride

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:02.158
up the coast of Vancouver Island
to this kind of remote surf spot,

00:06:02.158 --> 00:06:04.777
where we ended up watching
helplessly from the water

00:06:04.777 --> 00:06:07.168
as bears ravaged our camp site.

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:10.188
They walked off with our food
and bits of our tent,

00:06:10.188 --> 00:06:13.400
clearly letting us know that we
were at the bottom of the food chain

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.527
and that this was their spot, not ours.

00:06:15.527 --> 00:06:17.454
But to me, that trip

00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:22.046
was a testament to the wildness
I traded for those touristy beaches.

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:28.120
Now, it wasn't until I traveled
to Norway -- (Laughter) --

00:06:28.123 --> 00:06:31.204
that I really learned
to appreciate the cold.

00:06:32.294 --> 00:06:34.206
So this is the place

00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:37.573
where some of the largest,
the most violent storms in the world

00:06:37.573 --> 00:06:40.627
send huge waves smashing
into the coastline.

00:06:40.627 --> 00:06:44.605
We were in this tiny, remote fjord,
just inside the Arctic Circle.

00:06:44.605 --> 00:06:47.151
It had a greater population
of sheep than people,

00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:50.201
so help if we needed it
was nowhere to be found.

00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:53.151
I was in the water 
taking pictures of surfers,

00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:55.281
and it started to snow.

00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:59.867
And then the temperature began to drop.

00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:03.843
And I told myself, there's not a chance
you're getting out of the water.

00:07:03.843 --> 00:07:07.437
You traveled all this way, and this is
exactly what you've been waiting for:

00:07:07.437 --> 00:07:09.519
freezing cold conditions
with perfect waves.

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:12.537
And although I couldn't even feel
my finger to push the trigger,

00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:14.049
I knew I wasn't getting out.

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:16.842
So I just did whatever I could.
I shook it off, whatever.

00:07:16.842 --> 00:07:18.525
But that was the point that I felt

00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:20.644
this wind gush through
the valley and hit me,

00:07:20.644 --> 00:07:26.056
and what started as this light snowfall
quickly became a full-on blizzard,

00:07:26.058 --> 00:07:30.226
and I started to lose
perception of where I was.

00:07:30.932 --> 00:07:34.092
I didn't know if I was drifting
out to sea or towards shore,

00:07:34.095 --> 00:07:38.047
and all I could really make out
was the faint sound of seagulls

00:07:38.047 --> 00:07:40.170
and crashing waves.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.646
Now, I knew this place had a reputation
for sinking ships and grounding planes,

00:07:45.646 --> 00:07:50.037
and while I was out there floating,
I started to get a little bit nervous.

00:07:50.609 --> 00:07:52.977
Actually, I was totally freaking out --

00:07:52.977 --> 00:07:56.414
(Laughter) -- and I was
borderline hypothermic,

00:07:56.414 --> 00:07:59.595
and my friends eventually
had to help me out of the water.

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:02.752
And I don't know if it was
delirium setting in or what,

00:08:02.752 --> 00:08:04.912
but they told me later

00:08:04.912 --> 00:08:09.091
I had a smile on my face the entire time.

00:08:10.415 --> 00:08:12.528
Now, it was this trip

00:08:12.528 --> 00:08:16.312
and probably that exact experience
where I really began to feel

00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:20.272
like every photograph was precious,

00:08:20.272 --> 00:08:24.302
because all of a sudden in that moment,
it was something I was forced to earn.

00:08:25.352 --> 00:08:30.257
And I realized, all this shivering
had actually taught me something:

00:08:30.257 --> 00:08:34.270
In life, there are no shortcuts to joy.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.893
Anything that is worth pursuing
is going to require us to suffer

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:40.855
just a little bit,

00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:44.547
and that tiny bit of suffering
that I did for my photography,

00:08:44.547 --> 00:08:47.844
it added a value to my work
that was so much more meaningful to me

00:08:47.844 --> 00:08:50.180
than just trying to fill
the pages of magazines.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:58.208
See, I gave a piece of myself
in these places,

00:08:58.208 --> 00:09:00.755
and what I walked away with

00:09:00.755 --> 00:09:05.046
was a sense of fulfillment
I had always been searching for.

00:09:06.326 --> 00:09:09.298
So I look back at this photograph.

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:14.018
It's easy to see frozen fingers
and cold wetsuits

00:09:14.018 --> 00:09:17.082
and even the struggle
that it took just to get there,

00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:21.128
but most of all,
what I see is just joy.

00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:23.996
Thank you so much.

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:29.383
(Applause)
