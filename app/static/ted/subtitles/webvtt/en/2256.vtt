00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:06.219
In 2011, during the final six months
of Kim Jong-Il's life,

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.199
I lived undercover in North Korea.

00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:15.259
I was born and raised
in South Korea, their enemy.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:18.751
I live in America, their other enemy.

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.067
Since 2002, I had visited
North Korea a few times.

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:29.785
And I had come to realize
that to write about it with any meaning,

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.617
or to understand the place
beyond the regime's propaganda,

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:39.352
the only option was total immersion.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.360
So I posed as a teacher and a missionary

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.148
at an all-male university in Pyongyang.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.001
The Pyongyang University
of Science and Technology

00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:03.934
was founded by Evangelical Christians
who cooperate with the regime

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:08.428
to educate the sons
of the North Korean elite,

00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:13.100
without proselytizing,
which is a capital crime there.

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:21.897
The students were 270 young men,
expected to be the future leaders

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:26.964
of the most isolated and brutal
dictatorship in existence.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.951
When I arrived, they became my students.

00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:37.618
2011 was a special year,

00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:43.883
marking the 100th anniversary of the birth
of North Korea's original Great Leader,

00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:45.366
Kim Il-Sung.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.361
To celebrate the occasion, the regime
shut down all universities,

00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:54.195
and sent students off to the fields

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.353
to build the DPRK's much-heralded ideal

00:01:58.378 --> 00:02:02.019
as the world's most powerful
and prosperous nation.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.855
My students were the only ones
spared from that fate.

00:02:09.502 --> 00:02:13.165
North Korea is a gulag posing as a nation.

00:02:14.038 --> 00:02:16.470
Everything there
is about the Great Leader.

00:02:16.494 --> 00:02:21.804
Every book, every newspaper article,
every song, every TV program --

00:02:21.828 --> 00:02:23.480
there is just one subject.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.911
The flowers are named after him,

00:02:25.935 --> 00:02:28.807
the mountains are carved with his slogans.

00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:33.188
Every citizen wears the badge
of the Great Leader at all times.

00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:38.043
Even their calendar system begins
with the birth of Kim Il-Sung.

00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:44.259
The school was a heavily guarded
prison, posing as a campus.

00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:50.373
Teachers could only leave on group outings
accompanied by an official minder.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.333
Even then, our trips were limited
to sanctioned national monuments

00:02:57.357 --> 00:02:59.164
celebrating the Great Leader.

00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:04.250
The students were not allowed
to leave the campus,

00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:06.912
or communicate with their parents.

00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:12.886
Their days were meticulously mapped out,
and any free time they had

00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:16.302
was devoted to honoring
their Great Leader.

00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:22.428
Lesson plans had to meet the approval
of North Korean staff,

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:26.657
every class was recorded and reported on,
every room was bugged,

00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.379
and every conversation, overheard.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:36.413
Every blank space was covered with the 
portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il,

00:03:36.413 --> 00:03:39.048
like everywhere else in North Korea.

00:03:41.092 --> 00:03:43.945
We were never allowed
to discuss the outside world.

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:48.979
As students of science and technology,
many of them were computer majors

00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:51.612
but they did not know
the existence of the Internet.

00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:56.413
They had never heard
of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs.

00:03:57.525 --> 00:04:01.533
Facebook, Twitter -- none of those things
would have meant a thing.

00:04:02.605 --> 00:04:05.048
And I could not tell them.

00:04:06.861 --> 00:04:09.211
I went there looking for truth.

00:04:10.135 --> 00:04:13.781
But where do you even start
when an entire nation's ideology,

00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:15.798
my students' day-to-day realities,

00:04:15.823 --> 00:04:19.774
and even my own position
at the universities,

00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:22.649
were all built on lies?

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.080
I started with a game.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.582
We played "Truth and Lie."

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.332
A volunteer would write a sentence
on the chalkboard,

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:36.107
and the other students had to guess

00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:39.134
whether it was a truth or a lie.

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:43.361
Once a student wrote, "I visited
China last year on vacation,"

00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:45.993
and everyone shouted, "Lie!"

00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:49.293
They all knew this wasn't possible.

00:04:49.317 --> 00:04:53.273
Virtually no North Korean is allowed
to leave the country.

00:04:53.297 --> 00:04:57.618
Even traveling within their own country
requires a travel pass.

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.846
I had hoped that this game would reveal
some truth about my students,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.933
because they lie so often and so easily,

00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:13.370
whether about the mythical
accomplishments of their Great Leader,

00:05:13.394 --> 00:05:17.432
or the strange claim that they cloned
a rabbit as fifth graders.

00:05:19.482 --> 00:05:24.399
The difference between truth and lies
seemed at times hazy to them.

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:28.514
It took me a while to understand
the different types of lies;

00:05:28.538 --> 00:05:31.514
they lie to shield their system
from the world,

00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:35.393
or they were taught lies,
and were just regurgitating them.

00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:38.035
Or, at moments, they lied out of habit.

00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:44.425
But if all they have ever known were lies,

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.949
how could we expect them to be otherwise?

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.889
Next, I tried to teach them essay writing.

00:05:52.408 --> 00:05:54.649
But that turned out to be
nearly impossible.

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:59.044
Essays are about coming up with
one's own thesis,

00:05:59.412 --> 00:06:02.973
and making an evidence-based
argument to prove it.

00:06:04.044 --> 00:06:07.961
These students, however, were
simply told what to think,

00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:09.135
and they obeyed.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.163
In their world, critical thinking
was not allowed.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.511
I also gave them the weekly assignment
of writing a personal letter,

00:06:19.535 --> 00:06:20.685
to anybody.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.484
It took a long time, but eventually
some of them began to write

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.183
to their mothers, their friends,
their girlfriends.

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.471
Although those were just homework,

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:37.051
and would never reach
their intended recipients,

00:06:37.076 --> 00:06:41.145
my students slowly began to reveal
their true feelings in them.

00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:46.522
They wrote that they were fed
up with the sameness of everything.

00:06:47.435 --> 00:06:49.379
They were worried about their future.

00:06:49.787 --> 00:06:54.711
In those letters, they rarely ever
mentioned their Great Leader.

00:06:58.806 --> 00:07:01.822
I was spending all of my time
with these young men.

00:07:02.558 --> 00:07:07.044
We all ate meals together,
played basketball together.

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:12.084
I often called them gentlemen,
which made them giggle.

00:07:12.858 --> 00:07:14.821
They blushed at the mention of girls.

00:07:16.332 --> 00:07:18.300
And I came to adore them.

00:07:18.703 --> 00:07:22.340
And watching them open up
even in the tiniest of ways,

00:07:22.364 --> 00:07:24.434
was deeply moving.

00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:27.881
But something also felt wrong.

00:07:28.973 --> 00:07:31.822
During those months
of living in their world,

00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:36.665
I often wondered if the truth would,
in fact, improve their lives.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.850
I wanted so much to tell them the truth,

00:07:42.874 --> 00:07:46.294
of their country and of the outside world,

00:07:46.318 --> 00:07:50.309
where Arab youth were turning
their rotten regime inside out,

00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:52.128
using the power of social media,

00:07:52.152 --> 00:07:56.850
where everyone except them was
connected through the world wide web,

00:07:56.874 --> 00:07:59.715
which wasn't worldwide after all.

00:08:01.489 --> 00:08:05.000
But for them, the truth was dangerous.

00:08:06.955 --> 00:08:11.854
By encouraging them to run after it,
I was putting them at risk --

00:08:11.878 --> 00:08:14.235
of persecution,

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:15.610
of heartbreak.

00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:21.413
When you're not allowed to express
anything in the open,

00:08:21.437 --> 00:08:24.318
you become good at reading
what is unspoken.

00:08:25.736 --> 00:08:30.760
In one of their personal letters to me,
a student wrote that he understood

00:08:30.784 --> 00:08:33.626
why I always called them gentlemen.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.433
It was because I was wishing them
to be gentle in life, he said.

00:08:42.767 --> 00:08:45.544
On my last day in December of 2011,

00:08:45.568 --> 00:08:48.318
the day Kim Jong-Il's death was announced,

00:08:48.342 --> 00:08:49.990
their world shattered.

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:55.380
I had to leave without a proper goodbye.

00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:59.205
But I think they knew
how sad I was for them.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.245
Once, toward the end of my stay,
a student said to me,

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:09.743
"Professor, we never think of you
as being different from us.

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:15.874
Our circumstances are different,
but you're the same as us.

00:09:15.898 --> 00:09:20.016
We want you to know that we truly
think of you as being the same."

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:29.806
Today, if I could respond
to my students with a letter of my own,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.306
which is of course impossible,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.929
I would tell them this:

00:09:37.876 --> 00:09:40.525
"My dear gentlemen,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.524
It's been a bit over three years
since I last saw you.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:47.795
And now, you must be 22 --
maybe even as old as 23.

00:09:48.565 --> 00:09:52.165
At our final class, I asked you
if there was anything you wanted.

00:09:53.822 --> 00:09:57.241
The only wish you expressed,
the only thing you ever asked of me

00:09:57.265 --> 00:10:00.683
in all those months we spent together,

00:10:00.707 --> 00:10:02.633
was for me to speak to you in Korean.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.310
Just once.

00:10:05.084 --> 00:10:07.560
I was there to teach you English;

00:10:07.584 --> 00:10:09.101
you knew it wasn't allowed.

00:10:10.144 --> 00:10:15.875
But I understood then, you wanted
to share that bond of our mother tongue.

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:21.282
I called you my gentlemen,

00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:25.727
but I don't know if being gentle
in Kim Jong-Un's merciless North Korea

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:26.933
is a good thing.

00:10:27.717 --> 00:10:30.044
I don't want you to lead a revolution --

00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:32.072
let some other young person do it.

00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:36.581
The rest of the world might casually
encourage or even expect

00:10:36.605 --> 00:10:38.955
some sort of North Korean Spring,

00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:41.501
but I don't want you to do anything risky,

00:10:41.525 --> 00:10:45.369
because I know in your world,
someone is always watching.

00:10:47.027 --> 00:10:49.511
I don't want to imagine
what might happen to you.

00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:55.167
If my attempts to reach you have
inspired something new in you,

00:10:55.191 --> 00:10:56.741
I would rather you forget me.

00:10:57.646 --> 00:11:01.985
Become soldiers of your Great Leader,
and live long, safe lives.

00:11:04.361 --> 00:11:09.060
You once asked me if I thought
your city of Pyongyang was beautiful,

00:11:09.084 --> 00:11:11.776
and I could not answer truthfully then.

00:11:13.609 --> 00:11:14.990
But I know why you asked.

00:11:15.493 --> 00:11:20.024
I know that it was important for you
to hear that I, your teacher,

00:11:20.048 --> 00:11:23.909
the one who has seen the world
that you are forbidden from,

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:27.260
declare your city as the most beautiful.

00:11:29.793 --> 00:11:34.948
I know hearing that would make
your lives there a bit more bearable,

00:11:34.972 --> 00:11:38.339
but no, I don't find
your capital beautiful.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.529
Not because it's monotone and concrete,

00:11:41.553 --> 00:11:43.416
but because of what it symbolizes:

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.273
a monster that feeds off
the rest of the country,

00:11:48.297 --> 00:11:51.170
where citizens are soldiers and slaves.

00:11:53.734 --> 00:11:55.342
All I see there is darkness.

00:11:57.932 --> 00:12:00.380
But it's your home, so I cannot hate it.

00:12:01.623 --> 00:12:06.660
And I hope instead that you,
my lovely young gentlemen,

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:09.178
will one day help make it beautiful.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.158
Thank you.

00:12:12.183 --> 00:12:17.348
(Applause)
