00:00:00.903 --> 00:00:06.376
When I was growing up, I really 
liked playing hide-and-seek a lot.

00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:10.492
One time, though, I thought climbing
a tree would lead to a great hiding spot,

00:00:10.492 --> 00:00:13.395
but I fell and broke my arm.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:17.478
I actually started first grade
with a big cast all over my torso.

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:22.323
It was taken off six weeks later,
but even then, I couldn't extend my elbow,

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:25.376
and I had to do physical therapy
to flex and extend it,

00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:28.271
100 times per day, seven days per week.

00:00:29.021 --> 00:00:32.063
I barely did it, because
I found it boring and painful,

00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:35.694
and as a result, it took me
another six weeks to get better.

00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:39.548
Many years later, my mom
developed frozen shoulder,

00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:44.044
which leads to pain
and stiffness in the shoulder.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.155
The person I believed for half of my life
to have superpowers

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:50.463
suddenly needed help
to get dressed or to cut food.

00:00:51.474 --> 00:00:54.283
She went each week to physical therapy,
but just like me,

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:56.187
she barely followed the home treatment,

00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:59.228
and it took her
over five months to feel better.

00:00:59.848 --> 00:01:02.503
Both my mom and I
required physical therapy,

00:01:02.503 --> 00:01:05.266
a process of doing a suite
of repetitive exercises

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:09.794
in order to regain the range of movement
lost due to an accident or injury.

00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:12.171
At first, a physical therapist
works with patients,

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:15.134
but then it's up to the patients
to do their exercises at home.

00:01:15.134 --> 00:01:18.923
But patients find physical therapy
boring, frustrating, confusing

00:01:18.923 --> 00:01:21.844
and lengthy before seeing results.

00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:26.837
Sadly, patient noncompliance
can be as high as 70 percent.

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:30.226
This means the majority of patients
don't do their exercises

00:01:30.226 --> 00:01:34.011
and therefore take
a lot longer to get better.

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:36.797
All physical therapists agree
that special exercises

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.957
reduce the time needed for recovery,

00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:41.333
but patients lack
the motivation to do them.

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:46.898
So together with three friends,
all of us software geeks,

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.987
we asked ourselves,

00:01:48.987 --> 00:01:53.585
wouldn't it be interesting if patients
could play their way to recovery?

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:56.441
We started building MIRA,
A P.C. software platform

00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:59.339
that uses this Kinect device,
a motion capture camera,

00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:03.072
to transform traditional exercises
into video games.

00:02:03.702 --> 00:02:08.364
My physical therapist has already set up
a schedule for my particular therapy.

00:02:08.364 --> 00:02:10.616
Let's see how this looks.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.746
The first game asks me
to fly a bee up and down

00:02:16.746 --> 00:02:19.277
to gather pollen to deposit in beehives,

00:02:19.277 --> 00:02:21.738
all while avoiding the other bugs.

00:02:21.738 --> 00:02:24.964
I control the bee by doing
elbow extension and flexion,

00:02:24.964 --> 00:02:28.846
just like when I was seven years old
after the cast was taken off.

00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:32.929
When designing a game,
we speak to physical therapists at first

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.856
to understand what movement
patients need to do.

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:37.527
We then make that a video game

00:02:37.527 --> 00:02:40.722
to give patients simple,
motivating objectives to follow.

00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:43.239
But the software is very customizable,

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.652
and physical therapists can also
create their own exercises.

00:02:47.192 --> 00:02:49.183
Using the software, my physical therapist

00:02:49.183 --> 00:02:51.471
recorded herself performing
a shoulder abduction,

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.664
which is one of the movements
my mom had to do

00:02:53.664 --> 00:02:55.361
when she had frozen shoulder.

00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:58.819
I can follow my therapist's example
on the left side of the screen,

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.511
while on the right, I see myself
doing the recommended movement.

00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:04.554
I feel more engaged and confident,

00:03:04.554 --> 00:03:07.015
as I'm exercising alongside my therapist

00:03:07.015 --> 00:03:10.870
with the exercises my therapist
thinks are best for me.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.795
This basically extends the application
for physical therapists

00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:18.323
to create whatever exercises
they think are best.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:21.574
This is an auction house game
for preventing falls,

00:03:21.574 --> 00:03:24.569
designed to strengthen muscles
and improve balance.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.564
As a patient, I need to do
sit and stand movements,

00:03:27.564 --> 00:03:29.422
and when I stand up,

00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:31.767
I bid for the items I want to buy.

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:33.880
(Laughter)

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.875
In two days, my grandmother
will be 82 years old,

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:39.290
and there's a 50 percent chance
for people over 80

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.171
to fall at least once per year,

00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.259
which could lead to a broken hip
or even worse.

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:48.415
Poor muscle tone and impaired balance
are the number one cause of falls,

00:03:48.415 --> 00:03:51.526
so reversing these problems
through targeted exercise

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:54.196
will help keep older people
like my grandmother

00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:57.029
safer and independent for longer.

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.514
When my schedule ends,
MIRA briefly shows me

00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:02.693
how I progressed throughout my session.

00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:05.620
I have just shown you
three different games

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.113
for kids, adults and seniors.

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:10.942
These can be used with orthopedic
or neurologic patients,

00:04:10.942 --> 00:04:13.886
but we'll soon have options
for children with autism,

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.311
mental health or speech therapy.

00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:18.999
My physical therapist
can go back to my profile

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.990
and see the data gathered
during my sessions.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.660
She can see how much I moved,
how many points I scored,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.610
with what speed I moved my joints,

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.841
and so on.

00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:31.118
My physical therapist can use all of this
to adapt my treatment.

00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:33.947
I'm so pleased this version is now in use

00:04:33.947 --> 00:04:37.244
in over 10 clinics
across Europe and the U.S.,

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:39.197
and we're working on the home version.

00:04:39.197 --> 00:04:43.670
We want to enable physical therapists
to prescribe this digital treatment

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.310
and help patients play their way
to recovery at home.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.473
If my mom or I had a tool like this
when we needed physical therapy,

00:04:51.473 --> 00:04:54.519
then we would have been more successful
following the treatment,

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:58.049
and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner.

00:04:58.049 --> 00:04:59.651
Thank you.

00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:02.031
(Applause)

00:05:02.031 --> 00:05:05.607
Tom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell me
what hardware is this

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:07.470
that they're rapidly putting away?

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.710
What is that made of,
and how much does it cost?

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.789
Cosmin Milhau: So it's
a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the demo,

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.534
but you just need a computer
and a Kinect, which is 120 dollars.

00:05:16.534 --> 00:05:19.981
TR: Right, and the Kinect is the thing
that people use for their Xboxes

00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:21.052
to do 3D games, right?

00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:24.113
CM: Exactly, but you don't need the Xbox,
you only need a camera.

00:05:24.113 --> 00:05:26.875
TR: Right, so this is less
than a $1,000 solution.

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:29.458
CM: Definitely, 400 dollars,
you can definitely use it.

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:32.254
TR: So right now, you're doing
clinical trials in clinics.

00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:32.993
CM: Yes.

00:05:32.993 --> 00:05:35.713
TR: And then the hope is to get it
so it's a home version

00:05:35.713 --> 00:05:37.392
and I can do my exercise remotely,

00:05:37.392 --> 00:05:40.922
and the therapist at the clinic
can see how I'm doing and stuff like that.

00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:41.989
CM: Exactly.

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:43.843
TR: Cool. Thanks so much.
CM: Thank you.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:44.584
(Applause)
