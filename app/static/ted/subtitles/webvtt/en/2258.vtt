WEBVTT

00:00:00.286 --> 00:00:02.807
Chris Anderson: So I guess
what we're going to do is

00:00:02.807 --> 00:00:05.268
we're going to talk about your life,

00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:08.426
and using some pictures
that you shared with me.

00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:11.375
And I think we should start
right here with this one.

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:13.743
Okay, now who is this?

00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:19.492
Martine Rothblatt: This is me
with our oldest son Eli.

00:00:19.492 --> 00:00:21.382
He was about age five.

00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:23.495
This is taken in Nigeria

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:27.489
right after having taken
the Washington, D.C. bar exam.

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.064
CA: Okay. But this doesn't
really look like a Martine.

00:00:32.084 --> 00:00:37.701
MR: Right. That was myself as a male,
the way I was brought up.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:43.733
Before I transitioned from male
to female and Martin to Martine.

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.762
CA: You were brought up Martin Rothblatt.

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:46.807
MR: Correct.

00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:51.431
CA: And about a year after this picture,
you married a beautiful woman.

00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:53.947
Was this love at first sight?
What happened there?

00:00:53.947 --> 00:00:55.757
MR: It was love at the first sight.

00:00:55.757 --> 00:01:00.170
I saw Bina at a discotheque
in Los Angeles,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.653
and we later began living together,

00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:07.484
but the moment I saw her,
I saw just an aura of energy around her.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.156
I asked her to dance.

00:01:09.156 --> 00:01:12.058
She said she saw an aura
of energy around me.

00:01:12.058 --> 00:01:15.753
I was a single male parent.
She was a single female parent.

00:01:15.753 --> 00:01:18.188
We showed each other
our kids' pictures,

00:01:18.188 --> 00:01:22.298
and we've been happily married
for a third of a century now.

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:26.832
(Applause)

00:01:26.832 --> 00:01:29.890
CA: And at the time, you were
kind of this hotshot entrepreneur,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.585
working with satellites.

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:33.847
I think you had two successful companies,

00:01:33.847 --> 00:01:35.951
and then you started
addressing this problem

00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:40.162
of how could you use satellites
to revolutionize radio.

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:41.825
Tell us about that.

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:43.961
MR: Right. I always
loved space technology,

00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:47.862
and satellites, to me, are sort of
like the canoes that our ancestors

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:50.021
first pushed out into the water.

00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:53.388
So it was exciting for me
to be part of the navigation

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:55.826
of the oceans of the sky,

00:01:55.826 --> 00:02:00.354
and as I developed different types
of satellite communication systems,

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:05.655
the main thing I did was to launch
bigger and more powerful satellites,

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:09.316
the consequence of which
was that the receiving antennas

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:11.290
could be smaller and smaller,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.144
and after going through
direct television broadcasting,

00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:18.678
I had the idea that if we could make
a more powerful satellite,

00:02:18.678 --> 00:02:21.418
the receiving dish could be so small

00:02:21.418 --> 00:02:24.710
that it would just be a section
of a parabolic dish,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.449
a flat little plate embedded
into the roof of an automobile,

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.350
and it would be possible to have
nationwide satellite radio,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.904
and that's Sirius XM today.

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:36.924
CA: Wow. So who here has used Sirius?

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:39.506
(Applause)

00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:41.684
MR: Thank you for
your monthly subscriptions.

00:02:41.684 --> 00:02:44.447
(Laughter)

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:48.649
CA: So that succeeded despite
all predictions at the time.

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:50.878
It was a huge commercial success,

00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:55.197
but soon after this, in the early 1990s,

00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:59.713
there was this big transition in your life
and you became Martine.

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:03.300
MR: Correct.
CA: So tell me, how did that happen?

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.877
MR: It happened in consultation with Bina
and our four beautiful children,

00:03:11.877 --> 00:03:16.749
and I discussed with each of them

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:22.739
that I felt my soul was always female,
and as a woman,

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.334
but I was afraid people would
laugh at me if I expressed it,

00:03:27.334 --> 00:03:29.863
so I always kept it bottled up

00:03:29.863 --> 00:03:32.998
and just showed my male side.

00:03:32.998 --> 00:03:36.016
And each of them
had a different take on this.

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:40.497
Bina said, "I love your soul,

00:03:40.497 --> 00:03:44.073
and whether the outside
is Martin and Martine,

00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:46.488
it doesn't it matter to me,
I love your soul."

00:03:46.488 --> 00:03:54.150
My son said, "If you become a woman,
will you still be my father?"

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.377
And I said, "Yes,
I'll always be your father,"

00:03:57.377 --> 00:04:00.675
and I'm still his father today.

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:05.226
My youngest daughter did an absolutely
brilliant five-year-old thing.

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:10.287
She told people, "I love my dad
and she loves me."

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:16.432
So she had no problem
with a gender blending whatsoever.

00:04:16.432 --> 00:04:19.349
CA: And a couple years after this,
you published this book:

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.229
"The Apartheid of Sex."

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.458
What was your thesis in this book?

00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:27.800
MR: My thesis in this book is that there
are seven billion people in the world,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.117
and actually, seven billion unique ways
to express one's gender.

00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:39.549
And while people may have
the genitals of a male or a female,

00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:42.591
the genitals don't determine your gender

00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:45.400
or even really your sexual identity.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.095
That's just a matter of anatomy

00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:48.906
and reproductive tracts,

00:04:48.906 --> 00:04:52.111
and people could choose
whatever gender they want

00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:57.477
if they weren't forced by society
into categories of either male or female

00:04:57.477 --> 00:05:01.771
the way South Africa used to force people
into categories of black or white.

00:05:01.778 --> 00:05:05.980
We know from anthropological science
that race is fiction,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.782
even though racism is very, very real,

00:05:08.782 --> 00:05:11.382
and we now know from cultural studies

00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:15.140
that separate male or female genders
is a constructed fiction.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.335
The reality is a gender fluidity

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:22.225
that crosses the entire continuum
from male to female.

00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:25.784
CA: You yourself don't always
feel 100 percent female.

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:28.019
MR: Correct. I would say in some ways

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:31.920
I change my gender about as often
as I change my hairstyle.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:39.142
CA: (Laughs) Okay, now, this is
your gorgeous daughter, Jenesis.

00:05:39.142 --> 00:05:43.525
And I guess she was about this age
when something pretty terrible happened.

00:05:43.525 --> 00:05:48.800
MR: Yes, she was finding herself
unable to walk up the stairs

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.611
in our house to her bedroom,

00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:52.813
and after several months of doctors,

00:05:52.813 --> 00:05:57.267
she was diagnosed to have a rare,
almost invariably fatal disease

00:05:57.267 --> 00:06:01.338
called pulmonary arterial hypertension.

00:06:01.338 --> 00:06:03.869
CA: So how did you respond to that?

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:07.398
MR: Well, we first tried to get her
to the best doctors we could.

00:06:07.398 --> 00:06:11.415
We ended up at Children's National
Medical Center in Washington, D.C.

00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:13.621
The head of pediatric cardiology

00:06:13.621 --> 00:06:18.105
told us that he was going to refer her
to get a lung transplant,

00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:19.984
but not to hold out any hope,

00:06:19.984 --> 00:06:22.096
because there are
very few lungs available,

00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:23.861
especially for children.

00:06:23.861 --> 00:06:28.319
He said that all people
with this illness died,

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.939
and if any of you have seen
the film "Lorenzo's Oil,"

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:34.843
there's a scene when the protagonist

00:06:34.843 --> 00:06:41.089
kind of rolls down the stairway
crying and bemoaning the fate of his son,

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:44.456
and that's exactly
how we felt about Jenesis.

00:06:44.456 --> 00:06:48.078
CA: But you didn't accept that
as the limit of what you could do.

00:06:48.078 --> 00:06:52.915
You started trying to research
and see if you could find a cure somehow.

00:06:52.915 --> 00:06:56.739
MR: Correct. She was in the intensive
care ward for weeks at a time,

00:06:56.739 --> 00:07:00.709
and Bina and I would tag team
to stay at the hospital

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:03.101
while the other watched
the rest of the kids,

00:07:03.101 --> 00:07:05.678
and when I was in the hospital
and she was sleeping,

00:07:05.678 --> 00:07:07.373
I went to the hospital library.

00:07:07.373 --> 00:07:12.221
I read every article that I could find
on pulmonary hypertension.

00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:15.680
I had not taken any biology,
even in college,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.307
so I had to go from a biology textbook
to a college-level textbook

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:25.572
and then medical textbook
and the journal articles, back and forth,

00:07:25.572 --> 00:07:29.635
and eventually I knew enough to think
that it might be possible

00:07:29.635 --> 00:07:31.400
that somebody could find a cure.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.254
So we started a nonprofit foundation.

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:39.597
I wrote a description
asking people to submit grants

00:07:39.597 --> 00:07:42.336
and we would pay for medical research.

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:45.981
I became an expert on the condition --
doctors said to me, Martine,

00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:49.696
we really appreciate all the funding
you've provided us,

00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:53.736
but we are not going to be able
to find a cure in time

00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:55.454
to save your daughter.

00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:57.451
However, there is a medicine

00:07:57.451 --> 00:08:02.652
that was developed at the
Burroughs Wellcome Company

00:08:02.652 --> 00:08:05.764
that could halt the progression
of the disease,

00:08:05.764 --> 00:08:10.570
but Burroughs Wellcome has just
been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.723
They made a decision not to develop

00:08:12.723 --> 00:08:16.015
any medicines for rare
and orphan diseases,

00:08:16.015 --> 00:08:20.612
and maybe you could use your expertise
in satellite communications

00:08:20.612 --> 00:08:24.231
to develop this cure
for pulmonary hypertension.

00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:28.254
CA: So how on earth did you get
access to this drug?

00:08:28.254 --> 00:08:30.428
MR: I went to Glaxo Wellcome

00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:35.907
and after three times being rejected
and having the door slammed in my face

00:08:35.907 --> 00:08:39.415
because they weren't going
to out-license the drug

00:08:39.415 --> 00:08:42.208
to a satellite communications expert,

00:08:42.208 --> 00:08:48.643
they weren't going to send the drug
out to anybody at all,

00:08:48.643 --> 00:08:51.682
and they thought
I didn't have the expertise,

00:08:51.682 --> 00:08:58.276
finally I was able to persuade
a small team of people to work with me

00:08:58.276 --> 00:09:00.644
and develop enough credibility.

00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:02.525
I wore down their resistance,

00:09:02.525 --> 00:09:06.095
and they had no hope this drug
would even work, by the way,

00:09:06.095 --> 00:09:08.813
and they tried to tell me,
"You're just wasting your time.

00:09:08.813 --> 00:09:10.414
We're sorry about your daughter."

00:09:10.414 --> 00:09:13.432
But finally, for 25,000 dollars

00:09:13.432 --> 00:09:17.890
and agreement to pay 10 percent
of any revenues we might ever get,

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.200
they agreed to give me
worldwide rights to this drug.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:28.616
CA: And so you put this drug on the market
in a really brilliant way,

00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:33.354
by basically charging what it would take
to make the economics work.

00:09:33.354 --> 00:09:37.185
MR: Oh yes, Chris, but this really wasn't
a drug that I ended up --

00:09:37.185 --> 00:09:40.180
after I wrote the check for 25,000,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.990
and I said, "Okay, where's
the medicine for Jenesis?"

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.171
they said, "Oh, Martine,
there's no medicine for Jenesis.

00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:48.377
This is just something we tried in rats."

00:09:48.377 --> 00:09:52.092
And they gave me, like,
a little plastic Ziploc bag

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.647
of a small amount of powder.

00:09:53.647 --> 00:09:56.457
They said, "Don't give it to any human,"

00:09:56.457 --> 00:10:00.265
and they gave me a piece of paper
which said it was a patent,

00:10:00.265 --> 00:10:04.096
and from that, we had to figure out
a way to make this medicine.

00:10:04.096 --> 00:10:07.161
A hundred chemists in the U.S.
at the top universities

00:10:07.161 --> 00:10:11.830
all swore that little patent
could never be turned into a medicine.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.125
If it was turned into a medicine,
it could never be delivered

00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:18.352
because it had a half-life
of only 45 minutes.

00:10:18.352 --> 00:10:22.810
CA: And yet, a year or two later,
you were there with a medicine

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.967
that worked for Jenesis.

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:32.001
MR: Chris, the astonishing thing
is that this absolutely worthless

00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:33.654
piece of powder

00:10:33.654 --> 00:10:37.717
that had the sparkle of a promise
of hope for Jenesis

00:10:37.717 --> 00:10:42.964
is not only keeping Jenesis
and other people alive today,

00:10:42.964 --> 00:10:47.097
but produces almost a billion
and a half dollars a year in revenue.

00:10:47.097 --> 00:10:50.923
(Applause)

00:10:50.923 --> 00:10:53.454
CA: So here you go.

00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:57.007
So you took this company public, right?

00:10:57.007 --> 00:10:59.537
And made an absolute fortune.

00:10:59.537 --> 00:11:03.531
And how much have you paid Glaxo,
by the way, after that 25,000?

00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:07.339
MR: Yeah, well, every year we pay them
10 percent of 1.5 billion,

00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:11.054
150 million dollars,
last year 100 million dollars.

00:11:11.054 --> 00:11:14.165
It's the best return on investment
they ever received. (Laughter)

00:11:14.165 --> 00:11:16.232
CA: And the best news of all, I guess,

00:11:16.232 --> 00:11:18.089
is this.

00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:22.362
MR: Yes. Jenesis is an absolutely
brilliant young lady.

00:11:22.362 --> 00:11:24.985
She's alive, healthy today at 30.

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:27.447
You see me, Bina and Jenesis there.

00:11:27.447 --> 00:11:30.326
The most amazing thing about Jenesis

00:11:30.326 --> 00:11:33.228
is that while she could do
anything with her life,

00:11:33.228 --> 00:11:36.924
and believe me, if you grew up
your whole life with people

00:11:36.924 --> 00:11:39.846
in your face saying
that you've got a fatal disease,

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:44.559
I would probably run to Tahiti and just
not want to run into anybody again.

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:47.694
But instead she chooses to work
in United Therapeutics.

00:11:47.694 --> 00:11:51.304
She says she wants to do all she can
to help other people

00:11:51.304 --> 00:11:53.522
with orphan diseases get medicines,

00:11:53.522 --> 00:11:58.212
and today, she's our project leader
for all telepresence activities,

00:11:58.212 --> 00:12:01.741
where she helps digitally unite
the entire company to work together

00:12:01.741 --> 00:12:04.690
to find cures for pulmonary hypertension.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.987
CA: But not everyone who has this disease
has been so fortunate.

00:12:07.987 --> 00:12:12.442
There are still many people dying,
and you are tackling that too. How?

00:12:12.442 --> 00:12:16.926
MR: Exactly, Chris. There's some 3,000
people a year in the United States alone,

00:12:16.926 --> 00:12:19.805
perhaps 10 times that number worldwide,

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:21.960
who continue to die of this illness

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.490
because the medicines
slow down the progression

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.185
but they don't halt it.

00:12:26.185 --> 00:12:30.924
The only cure for pulmonary hypertension,
pulmonary fibrosis,

00:12:30.924 --> 00:12:33.360
cystic fibrosis, emphysema,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.355
COPD, what Leonard Nimoy just died of,

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:38.863
is a lung transplant,

00:12:38.863 --> 00:12:43.623
but sadly, there are only enough
available lungs for 2,000 people

00:12:43.623 --> 00:12:46.525
in the U.S. a year
to get a lung transplant,

00:12:46.525 --> 00:12:49.822
whereas nearly a half
million people a year

00:12:49.822 --> 00:12:52.121
die of end-stage lung failure.

00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:54.815
CA: So how can you address that?

00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:57.299
MR: So I conceptualize the possibility

00:12:57.299 --> 00:13:00.712
that just like we keep cars and planes

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:03.104
and buildings going forever

00:13:03.104 --> 00:13:07.331
with an unlimited supply
of building parts and machine parts,

00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:10.521
why can't we create an unlimited supply
of transplantable organs

00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:13.459
to keep people living indefinitely,

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:16.106
and especially people with lung disease.

00:13:16.106 --> 00:13:21.632
So we've teamed up with the decoder
of the human genome, Craig Venter,

00:13:21.632 --> 00:13:23.444
and the company he founded

00:13:23.444 --> 00:13:26.950
with Peter Diamandis,
the founder of the X Prize,

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.016
to genetically modify

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:30.711
the pig genome

00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:35.216
so that the pig's organs will not
be rejected by the human body

00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:38.327
and thereby to create an unlimited supply

00:13:38.327 --> 00:13:40.742
of transplantable organs.

00:13:40.742 --> 00:13:43.714
We do this through our company,
United Therapeutics.

00:13:43.714 --> 00:13:46.779
CA: So you really believe that within,
what, a decade,

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:51.260
that this shortage of transplantable lungs
maybe be cured, through these guys?

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.839
MR: Absolutely, Chris.

00:13:52.839 --> 00:13:56.531
I'm as certain of that as I was
of the success that we've had

00:13:56.531 --> 00:13:59.619
with direct television
broadcasting, Sirius XM.

00:13:59.619 --> 00:14:01.825
It's actually not rocket science.

00:14:01.825 --> 00:14:05.284
It's straightforward engineering away
one gene after another.

00:14:05.284 --> 00:14:09.626
We're so lucky to be born in the time
that sequencing genomes

00:14:09.626 --> 00:14:12.285
is a routine activity,

00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:14.723
and the brilliant folks
at Synthetic Genomics

00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:16.929
are able to zero in on the pig genome,

00:14:16.929 --> 00:14:20.321
find exactly the genes
that are problematic, and fix them.

00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.360
CA: But it's not just bodies that --
though that is amazing.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.681
(Applause)

00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:30.976
It's not just long-lasting bodies
that are of interest to you now.

00:14:30.976 --> 00:14:33.008
It's long-lasting minds.

00:14:33.008 --> 00:14:38.848
And I think this graph for you
says something quite profound.

00:14:38.848 --> 00:14:40.032
What does this mean?

00:14:40.032 --> 00:14:43.680
MR: What this graph means,
and it comes from Ray Kurzweil,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.460
is that the rate of development
in computer processing

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.293
hardware, firmware and software,

00:14:51.293 --> 00:14:54.288
has been advancing along a curve

00:14:54.288 --> 00:14:58.460
such that by the 2020s, as we saw
in earlier presentations today,

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.625
there will be information technology

00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:05.108
that processes information
and the world around us

00:15:05.108 --> 00:15:07.523
at the same rate as a human mind.

00:15:08.333 --> 00:15:12.027
CA: And so that being so, you're actually
getting ready for this world

00:15:12.027 --> 00:15:16.114
by believing that we will soon
be able to, what,

00:15:16.114 --> 00:15:22.457
actually take the contents of our brains
and somehow preserve them forever?

00:15:22.457 --> 00:15:24.287
How do you describe that?

00:15:24.287 --> 00:15:28.728
MR: Well, Chris, what we're working on
is creating a situation

00:15:28.728 --> 00:15:31.213
where people can create a mind file,

00:15:31.213 --> 00:15:35.221
and a mind file is the collection
of their mannerisms, personality,

00:15:35.221 --> 00:15:37.101
recollection, feelings,

00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:38.657
beliefs, attitudes and values,

00:15:38.657 --> 00:15:44.999
everything that we've poured today
into Google, into Amazon, into Facebook,

00:15:44.999 --> 00:15:51.174
and all of this information stored there
will be able, in the next couple decades,

00:15:51.174 --> 00:15:55.560
once software is able
to recapitulate consciousness,

00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:00.474
be able to revive the consciousness
which is imminent in our mind file.

00:16:00.474 --> 00:16:03.039
CA: Now you're not just
messing around with this.

00:16:03.039 --> 00:16:06.160
You're serious. I mean, who is this?

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.549
MR: This is a robot version of
my beloved spouse, Bina.

00:16:10.549 --> 00:16:13.010
And we call her Bina 48.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.609
She was programmed
by Hanson Robotics out of Texas.

00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:19.581
There's the centerfold
from National Geographic magazine

00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:22.251
with one of her caregivers,

00:16:22.251 --> 00:16:24.294
and she roams the web

00:16:24.294 --> 00:16:29.548
and has hundreds of hours
of Bina's mannerisms, personalities.

00:16:29.548 --> 00:16:31.794
She's kind of like a two-year-old kid,

00:16:31.794 --> 00:16:34.975
but she says things
that blow people away,

00:16:34.975 --> 00:16:37.610
best expressed by perhaps

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.418
a New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalist Amy Harmon

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.996
who says her answers
are often frustrating,

00:16:43.996 --> 00:16:50.195
but other times as compelling as those
of any flesh person she's interviewed.

00:16:50.195 --> 00:16:54.593
CA: And is your thinking here,
part of your hope here, is that

00:16:54.593 --> 00:17:01.038
this version of Bina can in a sense
live on forever, or some future upgrade

00:17:01.038 --> 00:17:03.430
to this version can live on forever?

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.836
MR: Yes. Not just Bina, but everybody.

00:17:05.836 --> 00:17:09.853
You know, it costs us virtually nothing
to store our mind files

00:17:09.853 --> 00:17:12.779
on Facebook, Instagram, what-have-you.

00:17:12.779 --> 00:17:16.842
Social media is I think one of the most
extraordinary inventions of our time,

00:17:16.842 --> 00:17:20.836
and as apps become available
that will allow us

00:17:20.836 --> 00:17:23.924
to out-Siri Siri, better and better,

00:17:23.924 --> 00:17:26.571
and develop consciousness
operating systems,

00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:29.473
everybody in the world,
billions of people,

00:17:29.473 --> 00:17:33.211
will be able to develop
mind clones of themselves

00:17:33.211 --> 00:17:35.765
that will have their own life on the web.

00:17:35.765 --> 00:17:37.219
CA: So the thing is, Martine,

00:17:37.219 --> 00:17:41.342
that in any normal conversation,
this would sound stark-staring mad,

00:17:41.342 --> 00:17:44.696
but in the context of your life,
what you've done,

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:46.786
some of the things we've heard this week,

00:17:46.786 --> 00:17:48.982
the constructed realities
that our minds give,

00:17:48.982 --> 00:17:52.776
I mean, you wouldn't bet against it.

00:17:52.776 --> 00:17:55.632
MR: Well, I think it's really nothing
coming from me.

00:17:55.632 --> 00:18:02.296
If anything, I'm perhaps a bit
of a communicator of activities

00:18:02.296 --> 00:18:05.686
that are being undertaken
by the greatest companies

00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:09.006
in China, Japan, India, the U.S., Europe.

00:18:09.006 --> 00:18:13.709
There are tens of millions of people
working on writing code

00:18:13.709 --> 00:18:17.424
that expresses more and more aspects
of our human consciousness,

00:18:17.424 --> 00:18:22.509
and you don't have to be a genius
to see that all these threads

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:26.641
are going to come together
and ultimately create human consciousness,

00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:28.847
and it's something we'll value.

00:18:28.847 --> 00:18:31.285
There are so many things
to do in this life,

00:18:31.285 --> 00:18:35.888
and if we could have a simulacrum,
a digital doppelgänger of ourselves

00:18:35.888 --> 00:18:38.785
that helps us process books, do shopping,

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.735
be our best friends,

00:18:40.735 --> 00:18:43.777
I believe our mind clones,
these digital versions of ourselves,

00:18:43.777 --> 00:18:46.378
will ultimately be our best friends,

00:18:46.378 --> 00:18:48.398
and for me personally and Bina personally,

00:18:48.398 --> 00:18:50.186
we love each other like crazy.

00:18:50.186 --> 00:18:51.982
Each day, we are always saying, like,

00:18:51.982 --> 00:18:54.517
"Wow, I love you even more
than 30 years ago.

00:18:54.517 --> 00:18:57.663
And so for us, the prospect of mind clones

00:18:57.663 --> 00:18:59.707
and regenerated bodies

00:18:59.707 --> 00:19:02.797
is that our love affair, Chris,
can go on forever.

00:19:02.797 --> 00:19:05.999
And we never get bored of each other.
I'm sure we never will.

00:19:05.999 --> 00:19:08.371
CA: I think Bina's here, right?
MR: She is, yeah.

00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:11.554
CA: Would it be too much, I don't know,
do we have a handheld mic?

00:19:11.554 --> 00:19:15.246
Bina, could we invite you to the stage?
I just have to ask you one question.

00:19:15.246 --> 00:19:16.894
Besides, we need to see you.

00:19:16.894 --> 00:19:19.843
(Applause)

00:19:23.442 --> 00:19:24.998
Thank you, thank you.

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:27.691
Come and join Martine here.

00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:32.544
I mean, look, when you got married,

00:19:32.544 --> 00:19:35.633
if someone had told you that,
in a few years time,

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:37.931
the man you were marrying
would become a woman,

00:19:37.931 --> 00:19:40.833
and a few years after that,
you would become a robot --

00:19:40.833 --> 00:19:43.898
(Laughter) --

00:19:43.898 --> 00:19:47.183
how has this gone? How has it been?

00:19:47.183 --> 00:19:49.749
Bina Rothblatt: It's been really
an exciting journey,

00:19:49.749 --> 00:19:52.089
and I would have never
thought that at the time,

00:19:52.089 --> 00:19:55.926
but we started making goals
and setting those goals

00:19:55.926 --> 00:19:57.197
and accomplishing things,

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:59.664
and before you knew it,
we just keep going up and up

00:19:59.664 --> 00:20:02.311
and we're still not stopping,
so it's great.

00:20:02.311 --> 00:20:05.376
CA: Martine told me something
really beautiful,

00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:08.135
just actually on Skype before this,

00:20:08.135 --> 00:20:13.966
which was that he wanted
to live for hundreds of years

00:20:13.966 --> 00:20:16.292
as a mind file,

00:20:16.292 --> 00:20:19.424
but not if it wasn't with you.

00:20:19.424 --> 00:20:21.532
BR: That's right,
we want to do it together.

00:20:21.532 --> 00:20:24.785
We're cryonicists as well,
and we want to wake up together.

00:20:24.785 --> 00:20:27.221
CA: So just so as you know,
from my point of view,

00:20:27.221 --> 00:20:30.936
this isn't only one of the most
astonishing lives I have heard,

00:20:30.936 --> 00:20:33.940
it's one of the most astonishing
love stories I've ever heard.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.300
It's just a delight to have you
both here at TED.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.646
Thank you so much.

00:20:37.646 --> 00:20:39.968
MR: Thank you.

00:20:39.968 --> 00:20:46.609
(Applause)
