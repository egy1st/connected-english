00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.976
So I grew up in Orlando, Florida.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.296
I was the son of an aerospace engineer.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.056
I lived and breathed the Apollo program.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.136
We either saw the launches
from our backyard

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.816
or we saw it by driving
in the hour over to the Cape.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.698
I was impressed by, obviously,
space and everything about it,

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:21.627
but I was most impressed
by the engineering that went into it.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.416
Behind me you see an amazing view,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.336
a picture that was taken
from the International Space Station,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.536
and it shows a portion of our planet

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.976
that's rarely seen and rarely studied

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.296
and almost never explored.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.856
That place is called the stratosphere.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.016
If you start on the planet
and you go up and up and up,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.616
it gets colder and colder and colder,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.016
until you reach the beginning
of the stratosphere,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.656
and then an amazing thing happens.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.696
It gets colder at a much slower rate,
and then it starts warming up,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.376
and then it gets warmer and warmer

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.336
until the point where you can
almost survive without any protection,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.176
about zero degrees,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.495
and then you end up
getting colder and colder,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.736
and that's the top of the stratosphere.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.696
It is one of the least accessible
places on our planet.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.456
Most often, when it's visited,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.376
it's by astronauts
who are blazing up at it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.256
at probably several times
the speed of sound,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.256
and they get a few seconds on the way up,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.056
and then they get this blazing
ball of fire coming back in,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.016
on the way back in.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.336
But the question I asked is, is it
possible to linger in the stratosphere?

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.696
Is it possible to experience
the stratosphere?

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.240
Is it possible to explore
the stratosphere?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.416
I studied this using
my favorite search engine

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.456
for quite a while, about a year,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.976
and then I made a scary phone call.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.696
It was a reference from a friend of mine
to call Taber MacCallum

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.456
from Paragon Space
Development Corporation,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.861
and I asked him the question:

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:03.245
is it possible to build

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.136
a system to go into the stratosphere?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.736
And he said it was.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.456
And after a period of about three years,
we proceeded to do just that.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.960
And on October 24 of last year,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.880
in this suit,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.840
I started on the ground,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.760
I went up in a balloon to 135,890 feet --

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.576
but who's counting?

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.056
(Laughter)

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.480
Came back to Earth
at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.840
It was a four-minute
and 27-second descent.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.680
And when I got to 10,000 feet,
I opened a parachute and I landed.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.680
(Applause)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.056
But this is really a science talk,
and it's really an engineering talk,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.376
and what was amazing to me
about that experience

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.056
is that Taber said, yes, I think
we can build a stratospheric suit,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.696
and more than that, come down tomorrow

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.856
and let's talk to the team
that formed the core of the group

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.080
that actually built it.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.736
And they did something
which I think is important,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.096
which is they took
the analogy of scuba diving.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.816
So in scuba diving,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.656
you have a self-contained system.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.016
You have everything
that you could ever need.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.080
You have a scuba tank.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.136
You have a wetsuit.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.896
You have visibility.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.656
And that scuba is exactly this system,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.120
and we're going to launch it
into the stratosphere.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.080
Three years later, this is what we have.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.856
We've got an amazing suit
that was made by ILC Dover.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.336
ILC Dover was the company
that made all of the Apollo suits

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.776
and all of the extravehicular
activity suits.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.056
They had never sold a suit commercially,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.656
only to the government,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.296
but they sold one to me,
which I am very grateful for.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.480
Up here we have a parachute.
This was all about safety.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.056
Everyone on the team knew

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.816
that I have a wife
and two small children --

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.416
10 and 15 --

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.495
and I wanted to come back safely.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.949
So there's a main parachute
and a reserve parachute,

00:04:19.973 --> 00:04:21.173
and if I do nothing,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.427
the reserve parachute is going to open
because of an automatic opening device.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.296
The suit itself
can protect me from the cold.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.256
This area in the front here
has thermal protection.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.456
It will actually heat water
that will wrap around my body.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.936
It has two redundant oxygen tanks.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.016
Even if I was to get
a quarter-inch hole in this suit,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.616
which is extremely unlikely,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.440
this system would still protect me
from the low pressure of space.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.976
The main advantage of this system
is weight and complexity.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.976
So the system weighs about 500 pounds,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.816
and if you compare it to the other attempt
recently to go up in the stratosphere,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.096
they used a capsule.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.096
And to do a capsule, there's an amazing
amount of complexity that goes into it,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.056
and it weighed about 3,000 pounds,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.776
and to raise 3,000 pounds
to an altitude of 135,000 feet,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.936
which was my target altitude,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.120
it would have taken a balloon
that was 45 to 50 million cubic feet.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.176
Because I only weighed
500 pounds in this system,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.416
we could do it with a balloon
that was five times smaller than that,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.856
and that allowed us to use a launch system
that was dramatically simpler

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.520
than what needs to be done
for a much larger balloon.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.136
So with that, I want to take you
to Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.856
We had an amazing team
that got up in the middle of the night.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.456
And here's the suit.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.616
Again, this is using the front loader
that you'll see in a second,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.856
and I want to play you a video
of the actual launch.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.896
Roswell's a great place
to launch balloons,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.096
but it's a fantastic place
to land under a parachute,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.520
especially when you're going to land
70 miles away from the place you started.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.680
That's a helium truck in the background.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.616
It's darkness.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.856
I've already spent about an hour
and a half pre-breathing.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.280
And then here you see the suit going on.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.240
It takes about an hour to get the suit on.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.216
Astronauts get this really nice
air-conditioned van

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.816
to go to the launch pad,
but I got a front loader.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.016
(Laughter)

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.576
You can see the top.
You can see the balloon up there.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.120
That's where the helium is.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.280
This is Dave clearing the airspace
with the FAA for 15 miles.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.560
And there we go.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.216
(Laughter)

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.936
That's me waving with my left hand.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.016
The reason I'm waving with my left hand

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.696
is because on the right hand
is the emergency cutaway.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.296
(Laughter)

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.160
My team forbade me
from using my right hand.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.616
So the trip up is beautiful.
It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.456
(Laughter)

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.576
It took two hours
and seven minutes to go up,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.336
and it was the most peaceful
two hours and seven minutes.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.240
I was mostly trying to relax.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.936
My heart rate was very low

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.080
and I was trying not to use
very much oxygen.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.576
You can see how the fields
in the background

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.216
are relatively big at this point,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.296
and you can see me going up and up.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.336
It's interesting here,
because if you look,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.736
I'm right over the airport,
and I'm probably at 50,000 feet,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.456
but immediately I'm about to go
into a stratospheric wind

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.200
of over 120 miles an hour.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.176
This is my flight director telling me
that I had just gone higher

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.416
than anybody else
had ever gone in a balloon,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.120
and I was about 4,000 feet from release.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.040
This is what it looks like.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.145
You can see the darkness of space,
the curvature of the Earth,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.400
the fragile planet below.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.400
I'm practicing my emergency procedures
mentally right now.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.656
If anything goes wrong,
I want to be ready.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.856
And the main thing that I want to do here

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:23.296
is to have a release and fall
and stay completely stable.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.240
(Video) Ground control. Everyone ready?

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.960
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.269
Alan Eustace: There's the balloon
going by, fully inflated at this point.

00:08:52.678 --> 00:08:56.536
And there you can see a drogue parachute,
which I'll demonstrate in just a second,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.136
because that's really important.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160
There's the balloon
going by a second time.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.360
Right now, I'm about
at the speed of sound.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.360
There's nothing for me to tell
it's the speed of sound,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.656
and very soon I will actually be
as fast as I ever get,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.320
822 miles an hour.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.153
(Video) Ground control: We lost the data.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.576
AE: So now I'm down low right now

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.896
and you can basically see
the parachute come out right there.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.682
At this point, I'm very happy
that there's a parachute out.

00:09:53.789 --> 00:09:55.456
I thought I was the only one happy,

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.816
but it turns out mission control
was really happy as well.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.936
The really nice thing about this
is the moment I opened --

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.336
I had a close of friend of mine,
Blikkies, my parachute guy.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.296
He flew in another airplane,
and he actually jumped out

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.296
and landed right next to me.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.576
He was my wingman on the descent.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.816
This is my landing, but it's probably more
properly called a crash.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.056
(Laughter)

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.536
I hate to admit it, but this wasn't
even close to my worst landing.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.416
(Laughter)

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.760
(Applause)

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.656
(Video) Man: How are you doing?

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.960
AE: Hi there!

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.496
Yay.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.816
(Laughter)

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.336
So I want to tell you one thing

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.656
that you might not have seen
in that video,

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.536
but one of the most critical parts
of the entire thing was the release

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.416
and what happens right after you release.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.736
And what we tried to do was use
something called a drogue parachute,

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.456
and a drogue parachute
was there to stabilize me.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.536
And I'll show you one of those right now.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.200
If any of you have ever
gone tandem skydiving,

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.640
you probably used one of these.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.136
But the problem with one of these things

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.096
is right when you release,
you're in zero gravity.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.736
So it's very easy for this
to just turn right around you.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.040
And before you know it,
you can be tangled up or spinning,

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.976
or you can release this drogue late,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.056
in which case what happens
is you're going down at 800 miles an hour,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.576
and this thing is going to destroy itself

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.800
and not be very useful.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.696
But the guys at United Parachute
Technologies came up with this idea,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.656
and it was a roll that looks like that,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.360
but watch what happens when I pull it out.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.160
It's forming a pipe.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.880
This pipe is so solid

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.136
that you can take this drogue parachute
and wrap it around,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.480
and there's no way
it will ever tangle with you.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.920
And that prevented
a very serious potential problem.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.496
So nothing is possible
without an amazing team of people.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.976
The core of this was about 20 people

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.096
that worked on this for the three years,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.736
and they were incredible.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.536
People asked me what the best part
of this whole thing was,

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.016
and it was a chance
to work with the best experts

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.656
in meteorology and ballooning
and parachute technology

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.136
and environmental systems
and high altitude medicine.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.296
It was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream
to work with that group of people.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.576
And I also at the same time
wanted to thank my friends at Google,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.456
both for supporting me during this effort

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.776
and also covering for me
in the times that I was away.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.096
But there's one other group
I wanted to thank, and that's my family.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.336
Yay.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:07.576
(Applause)

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.296
I would constantly give them speeches
about the safety of technology,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.520
and they weren't hearing any of it.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.456
It was super hard on them,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.056
and the only reason
that my wife put up with it

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:24.576
was because I came back incredibly happy
after each of the 250 tests,

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.776
and she didn't want
to take that away from me.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.576
So I want to close with a story.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.176
My daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old,
she and I were in the car,

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.656
and we were driving down the road,
and she was sitting there,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.056
and she had this idea, and she goes,
"Dad, I've got this idea."

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.600
And so I listened to her idea
and I said, "Katelyn, that's impossible."

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.936
And she looks at me

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.296
and she goes, "Dad,
after what you just did,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.720
how can you call anything impossible?"

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.016
And I laughed, and I said,
"OK, it's not impossible,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.440
it's just very, very hard."

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.736
And then I paused for a second,
and I said, "Katelyn,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.496
it may not be impossible,
it may not even be very, very hard,

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.296
it's just that I don't know how to do it."

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.536
Thank you.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.640
(Applause)
