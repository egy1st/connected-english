00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.072
I'm here to tell you
about the real search for alien life.

00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:07.906
Not little green humanoids
arriving in shiny UFOs,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.654
although that would be nice.

00:00:09.678 --> 00:00:12.955
But it's the search for planets
orbiting stars far away.

00:00:13.924 --> 00:00:15.759
Every star in our sky is a sun.

00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:17.164
And if our sun has planets --

00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:19.685
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.,

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:22.145
surely those other stars
should have planets also,

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.431
and they do.

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:24.867
And in the last two decades,

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:27.788
astronomers have found
thousands of exoplanets.

00:00:28.502 --> 00:00:31.313
Our night sky is literally
teeming with exoplanets.

00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:32.889
We know, statistically speaking,

00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:35.406
that every star has at least one planet.

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:37.961
And in the search for planets,

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:40.751
and in the future,
planets that might be like Earth,

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:42.144
we're able to help address

00:00:42.168 --> 00:00:45.017
some of the most amazing
and mysterious questions

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:47.612
that have faced humankind for centuries.

00:00:47.636 --> 00:00:48.882
Why are we here?

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.889
Why does our universe exist?

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:53.523
How did Earth form and evolve?

00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:56.896
How and why did life originate
and populate our planet?

00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:00.720
The second question
that we often think about is:

00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:02.030
Are we alone?

00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:04.299
Is there life out there?

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:06.601
Who is out there?

00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:10.789
You know, this question has been around
for thousands of years,

00:01:10.813 --> 00:01:13.230
since at least the time
of the Greek philosophers.

00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:15.801
But I'm here to tell you
just how close we're getting

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.706
to finding out the answer
to this question.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.945
It's the first time in human history
that this really is within reach for us.

00:01:23.294 --> 00:01:26.273
Now when I think about the possibilities
for life out there,

00:01:26.297 --> 00:01:30.384
I think of the fact that our sun
is but one of many stars.

00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:32.703
This is a photograph of a real galaxy,

00:01:32.727 --> 00:01:35.173
we think our Milky Way
looks like this galaxy.

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:36.836
It's a collection of bound stars.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.247
But our [sun] is one
of hundreds of billions of stars

00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:45.595
and our galaxy is one of upwards
of hundreds of billions of galaxies.

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:49.474
Knowing that small planets
are very common,

00:01:49.498 --> 00:01:50.772
you can just do the math.

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:55.425
And there are just so many stars
and so many planets out there,

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:58.139
that surely, there must be life
somewhere out there.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.480
Well, the biologists get furious
with me for saying that,

00:02:02.504 --> 00:02:05.948
because we have absolutely no evidence
for life beyond Earth yet.

00:02:06.977 --> 00:02:11.770
Well, if we were able to look
at our galaxy from the outside

00:02:11.794 --> 00:02:14.002
and zoom in to where our sun is,

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:15.586
we see a real map of the stars.

00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:19.069
And the highlighted stars
are those with known exoplanets.

00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:21.934
This is really just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:26.284
Here, this animation is zooming in
onto our solar system.

00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:28.357
And you'll see here the planets

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.214
as well as some spacecraft
that are also orbiting our sun.

00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:36.332
Now if we can imagine going
to the West Coast of North America,

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.482
and looking out at the night sky,

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:40.784
here's what we'd see on a spring night.

00:02:40.808 --> 00:02:42.818
And you can see
the constellations overlaid

00:02:42.842 --> 00:02:45.111
and again, so many stars with planets.

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:49.329
There's a special patch of the sky
where we have thousands of planets.

00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:53.043
This is where the Kepler Space Telescope
focused for many years.

00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:58.250
Let's zoom in and look
at one of the favorite exoplanets.

00:02:58.863 --> 00:03:02.124
This star is called Kepler-186f.

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.727
It's a system of about five planets.

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:08.576
And by the way, most of these exoplanets,
we don't know too much about.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.583
We know their size, and their orbit
and things like that.

00:03:11.607 --> 00:03:15.569
But there's a very special planet
here called Kepler-186f.

00:03:15.593 --> 00:03:19.697
This planet is in a zone
that is not too far from the star,

00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:22.980
so that the temperature
may be just right for life.

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:26.035
Here, the artist's conception
is just zooming in

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.329
and showing you what that planet
might be like.

00:03:31.074 --> 00:03:36.676
So, many people have this
romantic notion of astronomers

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.256
going to the telescope
on a lonely mountaintop

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.829
and looking at the spectacular night sky
through a big telescope.

00:03:43.853 --> 00:03:47.225
But actually, we just work
on our computers like everyone else,

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:51.074
and we get our data by email
or downloading from a database.

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:53.621
So instead of coming here to tell you

00:03:53.645 --> 00:03:56.776
about the somewhat tedious nature
of the data and data analysis

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.866
and the complex computer models we make,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.088
I have a different way
to try to explain to you

00:04:01.112 --> 00:04:03.757
some of the things
that we're thinking about exoplanets.

00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:04.947
Here's a travel poster:

00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:07.291
"Kepler-186f:

00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:10.029
Where the grass is always redder
on the other side."

00:04:10.053 --> 00:04:13.783
That's because Kepler-186f
orbits a red star,

00:04:13.807 --> 00:04:16.499
and we're just speculating
that perhaps the plants there,

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:19.141
if there is vegetation
that does photosynthesis,

00:04:19.165 --> 00:04:21.108
it has different pigments and looks red.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:26.495
"Enjoy the gravity on HD 40307g,

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.978
a Super-Earth."

00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:30.159
This planet is more massive than Earth

00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:31.905
and has a higher surface gravity.

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:35.230
"Relax on Kepler-16b,

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:37.150
where your shadow always has company."

00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:39.134
(Laughter)

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:43.340
We know of a dozen planets
that orbit two stars,

00:04:43.364 --> 00:04:45.483
and there's likely many more out there.

00:04:45.507 --> 00:04:47.468
If we could visit one of those planets,

00:04:47.492 --> 00:04:49.379
you literally would see two sunsets

00:04:49.403 --> 00:04:50.658
and have two shadows.

00:04:51.484 --> 00:04:53.901
So actually, science fiction
got some things right.

00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:55.134
Tatooine from Star Wars.

00:04:56.047 --> 00:04:58.342
And I have a couple of other
favorite exoplanets

00:04:58.366 --> 00:04:59.563
to tell you about.

00:04:59.587 --> 00:05:01.119
This one is Kepler-10b,

00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:03.126
it's a hot, hot planet.

00:05:03.642 --> 00:05:06.577
It orbits over 50 times closer to its star

00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:08.768
than our Earth does to our sun.

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:10.372
And actually, it's so hot,

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:13.029
we can't visit any
of these planets, but if we could,

00:05:13.053 --> 00:05:15.027
we would melt long before we got there.

00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:17.380
We think the surface
is hot enough to melt rock

00:05:17.404 --> 00:05:18.830
and has liquid lava lakes.

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:21.041
Gliese 1214b.

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:23.164
This planet, we know the mass and the size

00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:24.776
and it has a fairly low density.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.998
It's somewhat warm.

00:05:26.053 --> 00:05:28.737
We actually don't know
really anything about this planet,

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:31.266
but one possibility
is that it's a water world,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.797
like a scaled-up version
of one of Jupiter's icy moons

00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:37.304
that might be 50 percent water by mass.

00:05:37.328 --> 00:05:40.289
And in this case, it would have
a thick steam atmosphere

00:05:40.313 --> 00:05:42.169
overlaying an ocean,

00:05:42.193 --> 00:05:43.703
not of liquid water,

00:05:43.727 --> 00:05:46.732
but of an exotic form
of water, a superfluid --

00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:48.746
not quite a gas, not quite a liquid.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.370
And under that wouldn't be rock,

00:05:50.394 --> 00:05:51.990
but a form of high-pressure ice,

00:05:52.014 --> 00:05:53.290
like ice IX.

00:05:54.593 --> 00:05:56.768
So out of all these planets out there,

00:05:56.792 --> 00:06:00.006
and the variety
is just simply astonishing,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.160
we mostly want to find the planets
that are Goldilocks planets, we call them.

00:06:05.184 --> 00:06:07.101
Not too big, not too small,

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:08.972
not too hot, not too cold --

00:06:08.996 --> 00:06:10.345
but just right for life.

00:06:10.658 --> 00:06:12.776
But to do that,
we'd have to be able to look

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.134
at the planet's atmosphere,

00:06:14.158 --> 00:06:16.954
because the atmosphere
acts like a blanket trapping heat --

00:06:16.978 --> 00:06:18.314
the greenhouse effect.

00:06:18.338 --> 00:06:21.158
We have to be able to assess
the greenhouse gases

00:06:21.182 --> 00:06:22.332
on other planets.

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.288
Well, science fiction
got some things wrong.

00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:27.186
The Star Trek Enterprise

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.837
had to travel vast distances
at incredible speeds

00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:32.590
to orbit other planets

00:06:32.614 --> 00:06:36.590
so that First Officer Spock
could analyze the atmosphere

00:06:36.614 --> 00:06:38.575
to see if the planet was habitable

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.272
or if there were lifeforms there.

00:06:40.745 --> 00:06:43.235
Well, we don't need
to travel at warp speeds

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.388
to see other planet atmospheres,

00:06:45.412 --> 00:06:48.196
although I don't want to dissuade
any budding engineers

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.143
from figuring out how to do that.

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:52.459
We actually can and do study
planet atmospheres

00:06:52.483 --> 00:06:54.096
from here, from Earth orbit.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.297
This is a picture, a photograph
of the Hubble Space Telescope

00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:00.071
taken by the shuttle Atlantis
as it was departing

00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:02.334
after the last
human space flight to Hubble.

00:07:02.358 --> 00:07:04.244
They installed a new camera, actually,

00:07:04.268 --> 00:07:06.413
that we use for exoplanet atmospheres.

00:07:06.437 --> 00:07:11.342
And so far, we've been able to study
dozens of exoplanet atmospheres,

00:07:11.366 --> 00:07:13.490
about six of them in great detail.

00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:15.686
But those are not
small planets like Earth.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.104
They're big, hot planets
that are easy to see.

00:07:18.128 --> 00:07:19.366
We're not ready,

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.765
we don't have the right technology yet
to study small exoplanets.

00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:25.264
But nevertheless,

00:07:25.288 --> 00:07:29.185
I wanted to try to explain to you
how we study exoplanet atmospheres.

00:07:29.652 --> 00:07:31.874
I want you to imagine,
for a moment, a rainbow.

00:07:32.532 --> 00:07:35.278
And if we could look
at this rainbow closely,

00:07:35.302 --> 00:07:37.969
we would see that some
dark lines are missing.

00:07:39.127 --> 00:07:40.548
And here's our sun,

00:07:40.572 --> 00:07:42.339
the white light of our sun split up,

00:07:42.363 --> 00:07:44.649
not by raindrops, but by a spectrograph.

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:47.124
And you can see
all these dark, vertical lines.

00:07:47.148 --> 00:07:48.982
Some are very narrow, some are wide,

00:07:48.982 --> 00:07:50.407
some are shaded at the edges.

00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:54.035
And this is actually how astronomers
have studied objects in the heavens,

00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:55.554
literally, for over a century.

00:07:55.578 --> 00:07:58.004
So here, each different atom and molecule

00:07:58.028 --> 00:07:59.553
has a special set of lines,

00:07:59.577 --> 00:08:01.133
a fingerprint, if you will.

00:08:01.157 --> 00:08:03.894
And that's how we study
exoplanet atmospheres.

00:08:03.918 --> 00:08:06.278
And I'll just never forget
when I started working

00:08:06.302 --> 00:08:08.158
on exoplanet atmospheres 20 years ago,

00:08:08.182 --> 00:08:09.367
how many people told me,

00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:10.600
"This will never happen.

00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:13.414
We'll never be able to study them.
Why are you bothering?"

00:08:13.438 --> 00:08:17.112
And that's why I'm pleased to tell you
about all the atmospheres studied now,

00:08:17.136 --> 00:08:18.985
and this is really a field of its own.

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:21.531
So when it comes to
other planets, other Earths,

00:08:21.555 --> 00:08:23.632
in the future when we can observe them,

00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:25.715
what kind of gases
would we be looking for?

00:08:26.144 --> 00:08:29.319
Well, you know, our own Earth
has oxygen in the atmosphere

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:30.802
to 20 percent by volume.

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:32.714
That's a lot of oxygen.

00:08:33.457 --> 00:08:36.202
But without plants
and photosynthetic life,

00:08:36.226 --> 00:08:37.636
there would be no oxygen,

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.501
virtually no oxygen in our atmosphere.

00:08:40.116 --> 00:08:42.039
So oxygen is here because of life.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:46.170
And our goal then is to look for gases
in other planet atmospheres,

00:08:46.194 --> 00:08:48.231
gases that don't belong,

00:08:48.255 --> 00:08:50.638
that we might be able
to attribute to life.

00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:52.743
But which molecules should we search for?

00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:55.430
I actually told you
how diverse exoplanets are.

00:08:55.454 --> 00:08:57.451
We expect that to continue in the future

00:08:57.475 --> 00:08:58.776
when we find other Earths.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.372
And that's one of the main things
I'm working on now,

00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:02.689
I have a theory about this.

00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:05.001
It reminds me that nearly every day,

00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:07.677
I receive an email or emails

00:09:07.701 --> 00:09:11.328
from someone with a crazy theory
about physics of gravity

00:09:11.352 --> 00:09:13.184
or cosmology or some such.

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:16.541
So, please don't email me
one of your crazy theories.

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:17.779
(Laughter)

00:09:17.803 --> 00:09:19.981
Well, I had my own crazy theory.

00:09:20.005 --> 00:09:21.989
But, who does the MIT professor go to?

00:09:22.703 --> 00:09:26.914
Well, I emailed a Nobel Laureate
in Physiology or Medicine

00:09:26.938 --> 00:09:28.911
and he said, "Sure, come and talk to me."

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:30.934
So I brought my two biochemistry friends

00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.310
and we went to talk to him
about our crazy theory.

00:09:33.334 --> 00:09:36.775
And that theory was that life
produces all small molecules,

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:38.473
so many molecules.

00:09:38.497 --> 00:09:41.392
Like, everything I could think of,
but not being a chemist.

00:09:41.416 --> 00:09:42.599
Think about it:

00:09:42.623 --> 00:09:44.653
carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,

00:09:44.677 --> 00:09:46.536
molecular hydrogen, molecular nitrogen,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.926
methane, methyl chloride --

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.111
so many gases.

00:09:49.135 --> 00:09:51.070
They also exist for other reasons,

00:09:51.094 --> 00:09:52.946
but just life even produces ozone.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.728
So we go to talk to him about this,

00:09:54.752 --> 00:09:56.894
and immediately, he shot down the theory.

00:09:57.226 --> 00:09:59.493
He found an example that didn't exist.

00:09:59.948 --> 00:10:01.729
So, we went back to the drawing board

00:10:01.753 --> 00:10:05.181
and we think we have found something
very interesting in another field.

00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:06.625
But back to exoplanets,

00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:09.928
the point is that life produces
so many different types of gases,

00:10:09.952 --> 00:10:12.164
literally thousands of gases.

00:10:12.188 --> 00:10:14.855
And so what we're doing now
is just trying to figure out

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:16.468
on which types of exoplanets,

00:10:16.492 --> 00:10:19.712
which gases could be attributed to life.

00:10:22.182 --> 00:10:24.230
And so when it comes time
when we find gases

00:10:24.254 --> 00:10:25.605
in exoplanet atmospheres

00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:27.725
that we won't know
if they're being produced

00:10:27.749 --> 00:10:30.779
by intelligent aliens or by trees,

00:10:30.803 --> 00:10:32.013
or a swamp,

00:10:32.037 --> 00:10:34.898
or even just by simple,
single-celled microbial life.

00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:37.091
So working on the models

00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:38.766
and thinking about biochemistry,

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.987
it's all well and good.

00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:42.896
But a really big challenge
ahead of us is: how?

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.082
How are we going to find these planets?

00:10:45.106 --> 00:10:47.310
There are actually many ways
to find planets,

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.829
several different ways.

00:10:48.853 --> 00:10:52.712
But the one that I'm most focused on
is how can we open a gateway

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:53.973
so that in the future,

00:10:53.997 --> 00:10:55.846
we can find hundreds of Earths.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.203
We have a real shot
at finding signs of life.

00:10:58.227 --> 00:11:01.353
And actually, I just finished
leading a two-year project

00:11:01.377 --> 00:11:03.465
in this very special phase

00:11:03.489 --> 00:11:06.143
of a concept we call the starshade.

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:09.120
And the starshade
is a very specially shaped screen

00:11:09.144 --> 00:11:11.011
and the goal is to fly that starshade

00:11:11.035 --> 00:11:14.129
so it blocks out the light of a star

00:11:14.153 --> 00:11:17.092
so that the telescope
can see the planets directly.

00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:19.509
Here, you can see myself
and two team members

00:11:19.533 --> 00:11:21.722
holding up one small part
of the starshade.

00:11:21.746 --> 00:11:23.326
It's shaped like a giant flower,

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.833
and this is one of the prototype petals.

00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:31.368
The concept is that a starshade
and telescope could launch together,

00:11:31.392 --> 00:11:33.986
with the petals unfurling
from the stowed position.

00:11:34.896 --> 00:11:36.952
The central truss would expand,

00:11:36.976 --> 00:11:40.068
with the petals snapping into place.

00:11:40.092 --> 00:11:42.322
Now, this has to be made very precisely,

00:11:42.346 --> 00:11:43.934
literally, the petals to microns

00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.673
and they have to deploy to millimeters.

00:11:46.697 --> 00:11:48.752
And this whole structure would have to fly

00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:52.135
tens of thousands of kilometers
away from the telescope.

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:54.301
It's about tens of meters in diameter.

00:11:54.785 --> 00:11:59.738
And the goal is to block out
the starlight to incredible precision

00:11:59.762 --> 00:12:02.500
so that we'd be able to see
the planets directly.

00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:05.562
And it has to be a very special shape,

00:12:05.586 --> 00:12:07.475
because of the physics of defraction.

00:12:07.499 --> 00:12:09.718
Now this is a real project
that we worked on,

00:12:09.742 --> 00:12:12.210
literally, you would not believe how hard.

00:12:12.234 --> 00:12:14.896
Just so you believe
it's not just in movie format,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.556
here's a real photograph

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.571
of a second-generation
starshade deployment test bed in the lab.

00:12:21.595 --> 00:12:23.674
And in this case,
I just wanted you to know

00:12:23.698 --> 00:12:26.188
that that central truss
has heritage left over

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:28.126
from large radio deployables in space.

00:12:29.372 --> 00:12:31.028
So after all of that hard work

00:12:31.052 --> 00:12:34.845
where we try to think of all the crazy
gases that might be out there,

00:12:34.869 --> 00:12:37.797
and we build the very
complicated space telescopes

00:12:37.821 --> 00:12:39.048
that might be out there,

00:12:39.072 --> 00:12:40.368
what are we going to find?

00:12:40.725 --> 00:12:42.483
Well, in the best case,

00:12:42.507 --> 00:12:45.304
we will find an image
of another exo-Earth.

00:12:46.328 --> 00:12:48.587
Here is Earth as a pale blue dot.

00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:51.170
And this is actually
a real photograph of Earth

00:12:51.194 --> 00:12:53.064
taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft,

00:12:53.088 --> 00:12:54.706
four billion miles away.

00:12:55.159 --> 00:12:58.397
And that red light is just scattered light
in the camera optics.

00:12:59.315 --> 00:13:01.711
But what's so awesome to consider

00:13:01.735 --> 00:13:04.784
is that if there are intelligent aliens

00:13:04.808 --> 00:13:08.762
orbiting on a planet
around a star near to us

00:13:08.786 --> 00:13:10.831
and they build complicated
space telescopes

00:13:10.855 --> 00:13:12.782
of the kind that we're trying to build,

00:13:12.806 --> 00:13:15.306
all they'll see is this pale blue dot,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.615
a pinprick of light.

00:13:17.456 --> 00:13:20.522
And so sometimes, when I pause to think

00:13:20.546 --> 00:13:24.799
about my professional struggle
and huge ambition,

00:13:24.823 --> 00:13:26.816
it's hard to think about that

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.259
in contrast to the vastness
of the universe.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.246
But nonetheless, I am devoting
the rest of my life

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.620
to finding another Earth.

00:13:36.296 --> 00:13:38.511
And I can guarantee

00:13:38.535 --> 00:13:40.918
that in the next generation
of space telescopes,

00:13:40.942 --> 00:13:42.482
in the second generation,

00:13:42.506 --> 00:13:47.912
we will have the capability
to find and identity other Earths.

00:13:47.936 --> 00:13:50.610
And the capability
to split up the starlight

00:13:50.634 --> 00:13:52.187
so that we can look for gases

00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:55.697
and assess the greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere,

00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:57.319
estimate the surface temperature,

00:13:57.343 --> 00:13:59.101
and look for signs of life.

00:13:59.736 --> 00:14:01.157
But there's more.

00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:04.545
In this case of searching
for other planets like Earth,

00:14:04.569 --> 00:14:07.164
we are making a new kind of map

00:14:07.188 --> 00:14:10.448
of the nearby stars
and of the planets orbiting them,

00:14:10.472 --> 00:14:14.243
including [planets] that actually might be
inhabitable by humans.

00:14:14.915 --> 00:14:17.296
And so I envision that our descendants,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.125
hundreds of years from now,

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:22.176
will embark on an interstellar
journey to other worlds.

00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:25.971
And they will look back at all of us

00:14:25.995 --> 00:14:29.003
as the generation who first found
the Earth-like worlds.

00:14:29.822 --> 00:14:30.973
Thank you.

00:14:30.997 --> 00:14:37.508
(Applause)

00:14:37.532 --> 00:14:39.632
June Cohen: And I give you,
for a question,

00:14:39.656 --> 00:14:41.384
Rosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen.

00:14:41.817 --> 00:14:43.848
Fred Jansen: You mentioned halfway through

00:14:43.872 --> 00:14:47.659
that the technology
to actually look at the spectrum

00:14:47.683 --> 00:14:50.312
of an exoplanet like Earth
is not there yet.

00:14:50.336 --> 00:14:52.223
When do you expect this will be there,

00:14:52.247 --> 00:14:53.515
and what's needed?

00:14:53.539 --> 00:14:58.154
Actually, what we expect is what we call
our next-generation Hubble telescope.

00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:00.872
And this is called the James Webb
Space Telescope,

00:15:00.896 --> 00:15:02.599
and that will launch in 2018,

00:15:02.623 --> 00:15:04.445
and that's what we're going to do,

00:15:04.469 --> 00:15:06.733
we're going to look
at a special kind of planet

00:15:06.757 --> 00:15:08.213
called transient exoplanets,

00:15:08.237 --> 00:15:11.338
and that will be our first shot
at studying small planets

00:15:11.362 --> 00:15:14.660
for gases that might indicate
the planet is habitable.

00:15:15.477 --> 00:15:18.286
JC: I'm going to ask you
one follow-up question, too, Sara,

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.516
as the generalist.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.633
So I am really struck
by the notion in your career

00:15:22.657 --> 00:15:24.056
of the opposition you faced,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.224
that when you began thinking
about exoplanets,

00:15:26.248 --> 00:15:28.914
there was extreme skepticism
in the scientific community

00:15:28.938 --> 00:15:30.089
that they existed,

00:15:30.113 --> 00:15:31.382
and you proved them wrong.

00:15:31.406 --> 00:15:33.119
What did it take to take that on?

00:15:33.143 --> 00:15:35.213
SS: Well, the thing is that as scientists,

00:15:35.237 --> 00:15:37.195
we're supposed to be skeptical,

00:15:37.219 --> 00:15:40.267
because our job to make sure
that what the other person is saying

00:15:40.291 --> 00:15:41.630
actually makes sense or not.

00:15:41.654 --> 00:15:44.211
But being a scientist,

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:46.655
I think you've seen it from this session,

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.361
it's like being an explorer.

00:15:48.385 --> 00:15:50.374
You have this immense curiosity,

00:15:50.398 --> 00:15:51.697
this stubbornness,

00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:54.103
this sort of resolute will
that you will go forward

00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:56.158
no matter what other people say.

00:15:56.182 --> 00:15:57.858
JC: I love that. Thank you, Sara.

00:15:57.882 --> 00:16:00.877
(Applause)
