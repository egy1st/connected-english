WEBVTT

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.641
Someone who looks like me
walks past you in the street.

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:08.751
Do you think they're a mother,

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:10.199
a refugee

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.253
or a victim of oppression?

00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:14.454
Or do you think they're a cardiologist,

00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:15.496
a barrister

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:17.285
or maybe your local politician?

00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:20.283
Do you look me up and down,

00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:21.775
wondering how hot I must get

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:25.504
or if my husband has forced me
to wear this outfit?

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:29.261
What if I wore my scarf like this?

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.763
I can walk down the street
in the exact same outfit

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:37.420
and what the world expects of me
and the way I'm treated

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.771
depends on the arrangement
of this piece of cloth.

00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:43.885
But this isn't going to be
another monologue about the hijab

00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:47.861
because Lord knows, Muslim women
are so much more than the piece of cloth

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:51.820
they choose, or not,
to wrap their head in.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.564
This is about looking beyond your bias.

00:00:56.204 --> 00:00:58.084
What if I walked past you and later on

00:00:58.084 --> 00:01:01.678
you'd found out that actually
I was a race car engineer,

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:05.122
and that I designed my own race car
and I ran my university's race team,

00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:06.627
because it's true.

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:12.127
What if I told you that I was actually
trained as a boxer for five years,

00:01:12.127 --> 00:01:13.654
because that's true, too.

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:17.038
Would it surprise you?

00:01:17.038 --> 00:01:18.527
Why?

00:01:19.487 --> 00:01:21.319
Ladies and gentlemen, ultimately,


00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.347
that surprise and the behaviors
associated with it

00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:27.000
are the product of something 
called unconscious bias,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.372
or implicit prejudice.

00:01:28.372 --> 00:01:31.613
And that results in the
ridiculously detrimental

00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:33.351
lack of diversity in our workforce,

00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:35.714
particularly in areas of influence.

00:01:35.714 --> 00:01:38.246
Hello, Australian Federal Cabinet.

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:40.318
(Applause)

00:01:40.318 --> 00:01:43.327
Let me just set something out
from the outset:

00:01:43.327 --> 00:01:46.689
Unconscious bias is not the same
as conscious discrimination.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.199
I'm not saying that in all of you, 
there's a secret sexist or racist

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:52.841
or ageist lurking within, 
waiting to get out.

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:54.578
That's not what I'm saying.

00:01:54.578 --> 00:01:56.530
We all have our biases.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.869
They're the filters through which
we see the world around us.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.844
I'm not accusing anyone,

00:02:01.844 --> 00:02:03.338
bias is not an accusation.

00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:05.879
Rather, it's something that 
has to be identified,

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:09.082
acknowledged and mitigated against.

00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:10.476
Bias can be about race,

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:11.680
it can be about gender.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.383
It can also be about class,
education, disability.

00:02:15.383 --> 00:02:18.406
The fact is, we all have biases
against what's different,

00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:21.335
what's different to our social norms.

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:24.359
The thing is, if we want 
to live in a world

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.494
where the circumstances of your birth

00:02:27.494 --> 00:02:29.935
do not dictate your future

00:02:29.935 --> 00:02:32.140
and where equal opportunity is ubiquitous,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.697
then each and every one of us
has a role to play

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.960
in making sure unconscious bias
does not determine our lives.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.909
There's this really famous experiment
in the space of unconscious bias

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.637
and that's in the space of gender
in the 1970s and 1980s.

00:02:47.637 --> 00:02:51.672
So orchestras, back in the day,
were made up mostly of dudes,

00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:54.473
up to only five percent were female.

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:57.741
And apparently, that was because
men played it differently,

00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:00.555
presumably better, presumably.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:03.517
But in 1952, The Boston Symphony Orchestra

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:05.282
started an experiment.

00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:07.125
They started blind auditions.

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:10.954
So rather than face-to-face auditions,
you would have to play behind a screen.

00:03:10.954 --> 00:03:12.466
Now funnily enough,

00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:14.754
no immediate change was registered

00:03:14.754 --> 00:03:17.890
until they asked the audition-ers
to take their shoes off

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.578
before they entered the room.

00:03:19.578 --> 00:03:21.618
because the clickity-clack 
of the heels

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.559
against the hardwood floors

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.828
was enough to give the ladies away.

00:03:25.828 --> 00:03:27.334
Now get this,

00:03:27.334 --> 00:03:29.196
there results of the audition showed


00:03:29.196 --> 00:03:32.196
that there was a 50 percent
increased chance

00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:35.126
a woman would progress past
the preliminary stage.

00:03:35.126 --> 00:03:39.580
And it almost tripled 
their chances of getting in.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.093
What does that tell us?

00:03:41.093 --> 00:03:44.929
Well, unfortunately for the guys,
men actually didn't play differently,

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.829
but there was the perception
that they did.

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.146
And it was that bias that was
determining their outcome.

00:03:51.146 --> 00:03:54.244
So what we're doing here 
is identifying and acknowledging

00:03:54.244 --> 00:03:55.292
that a bias exists.

00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:56.910
And look, we all do it.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.697
Let me give you an example.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:02.475
A son and his father are in 
a horrible car accident.

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:04.339
The father dies on impact

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:07.999
and the son, who's severely injured,
is rushed to hospital.


00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:11.381
The surgeon looks at the son
when they arrive and is like,


00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:13.788
"I can't operate."

00:04:13.788 --> 00:04:15.694
Why?

00:04:15.694 --> 00:04:18.900
"The boy is my son."

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.248
How can that be?

00:04:20.248 --> 00:04:21.468
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:21.468 --> 00:04:24.334
the surgeon is his mother.

00:04:24.334 --> 00:04:26.077
Now hands up -- and it's okay --

00:04:26.077 --> 00:04:29.837
but hands up if you initially assumed
the surgeon was a guy?

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:33.838
There's evidence that
that unconscious bias exists,

00:04:33.838 --> 00:04:36.870
but we all just have
to acknowledge that it's there

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.554
and then look at ways 
that we can move past it

00:04:39.554 --> 00:04:42.258
so that we can look at solutions.

00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:45.075
Now one of the interesting things

00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:48.357
around the space of unconscious bias
is the topic of quotas.

00:04:48.357 --> 00:04:50.682
And this something 
that's often brought up.

00:04:50.682 --> 00:04:53.993
And of of the criticisms 
is this idea of merit.

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:57.165
Look, I don't want to be picked 
because I'm a chick,

00:04:57.165 --> 00:04:59.432
I want to be picked because 
I have merit,

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:01.608
because I'm the best person for the job.


00:05:01.608 --> 00:05:04.507
It's a sentiment that's pretty common
among female engineers

00:05:04.507 --> 00:05:06.413
that I work with and that I know.

00:05:06.413 --> 00:05:08.314
And yeah, I get it, I've been there.

00:05:08.314 --> 00:05:10.653
But, if the merit idea was true,

00:05:10.653 --> 00:05:15.420
why would identical resumes, 
in an experiment done in 2012 by Yale,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.014
identical resumes sent out
for a lab technician,

00:05:20.014 --> 00:05:23.230
why would Jennifers
be deemed less competent,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.494
be less likely to be offered the job,

00:05:25.494 --> 00:05:29.171
and be paid less than Johns.

00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:31.624
The unconscious bias is there,

00:05:31.624 --> 00:05:34.060
but we just have to look at
how we can move past it.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.681
And, you know, it's interesting,

00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:37.494
there's some research that talks about


00:05:37.494 --> 00:05:40.346
why this is the case and
it's called the merit paradox.

00:05:40.346 --> 00:05:42.867
And in organizations --
and this is kind of ironic --

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:46.694
in organizations that talk about merit
being their primary value-driver

00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:48.066
in terms of who they hire,

00:05:48.066 --> 00:05:51.561
they were more likely to hire dudes
and more likely to pay the guys more

00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:55.168
because apparently merit 
is a masculine quality.

00:05:55.168 --> 00:05:56.430
But, hey.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.744
So you guys think you've got 
a good read on me,

00:05:58.744 --> 00:06:02.175
you kinda think you know what's up.

00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:05.748
Can you imagine me running one of these?

00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:08.035
Can you imagine me walking in
and being like,

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:11.140
"Hey boys, this is what's up.
This is how it's done."

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.680
Well, I'm glad you can.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.163
(Applause)

00:06:25.233 --> 00:06:28.310
Because ladies and gentlemen,
that's my day job.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.247
And the cool thing about it is
that it's pretty entertaining.

00:06:31.247 --> 00:06:32.935
Actually, in places like Malaysia,

00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:35.395
Muslim women on rigs 
isn't even comment-worthy.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.764
There are that many of them.

00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:37.992
But, it is entertaining.

00:06:37.992 --> 00:06:40.049
I remember, I was telling one of the guys,

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:42.620
"Hey, mate, look, I really want 
to learn how to surf."

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.181
And he's like, "Yassmin, I don't
know how you can surf

00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:47.552
with all that gear you've got on,

00:06:47.552 --> 00:06:50.226
and I don't know any women-only beaches."

00:06:50.226 --> 00:06:52.510
And then, the guy came up 
with a brilliant idea,

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.768
he was like, "I know, you run
that organization

00:06:54.768 --> 00:06:56.628
Youth Without Borders, right?

00:06:56.628 --> 00:07:01.282
Why don't you start a clothing line
for Muslim chicks in beaches.

00:07:01.282 --> 00:07:03.919
You can call it 
Youth Without Boardshorts."

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.435
(Laughter)

00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:07.250
And I was like, "Thanks, guys."

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.356
And I remember another bloke 
telling me that

00:07:10.356 --> 00:07:12.169
I should eat all the yogurt I could

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:15.387
because that was the only culture 
I was going to get around there.

00:07:17.477 --> 00:07:20.366
But, the problem is, it's kind of true

00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:23.704
because there's an intense 
lack of diversity in our workforce,

00:07:23.704 --> 00:07:25.992
particularly in places of influence.

00:07:25.992 --> 00:07:27.352
Now, in 2010, 


00:07:27.352 --> 00:07:29.825
The Australian National University
did an experiment

00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:33.431
where they sent out
4,000 identical applications

00:07:33.431 --> 00:07:36.963
to entry level jobs, essentially.

00:07:36.963 --> 00:07:41.177
To get the same number of interviews
as someone with an Anglo-Saxon name,

00:07:41.177 --> 00:07:45.674
if you were Chinese, you had 
to send out 68 percent more applications.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:48.368
If you were Middle Eastern --
Abdel-Magied --

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:50.418
you had to send out 64 percent,

00:07:50.418 --> 00:07:52.581
and if you're Italian, 
you're pretty lucky,

00:07:52.581 --> 00:07:55.142
you only have to send out 12 percent more.

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:58.151
In places like Silicon Valley,
it's not that much better.

00:07:58.151 --> 00:08:00.448
In Google, they put out 
some diversity results

00:08:00.448 --> 00:08:07.390
and 61 percent white, 30 percent Asian
and nine, a bunch of blacks, Hispanics,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.717
all that kind of thing.

00:08:08.717 --> 00:08:11.345
And the rest of the tech world
is not that much better

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:12.677
and they've acknowledged it,

00:08:12.677 --> 00:08:15.225
but I'm not really sure
what they're doing about it.

00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:17.445
The thing is, it doesn't trickle up.

00:08:17.445 --> 00:08:19.203
In a study done by Green Park,

00:08:19.203 --> 00:08:23.275
who are a British senior exec supplier,

00:08:23.275 --> 00:08:27.738
they said that over half
of the FTSE 100 companies

00:08:27.738 --> 00:08:30.138
don't have a nonwhite leader
at their board level,

00:08:30.138 --> 00:08:31.593
executive or non-executive.

00:08:31.593 --> 00:08:35.686
And two out of every three
don't have an executive

00:08:35.686 --> 00:08:37.956
who's from a minority.

00:08:37.956 --> 00:08:40.778
And most of the minorities 
that are at that sort of level

00:08:40.778 --> 00:08:42.420
are non-executive board directors.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.086
So their influence isn't that great.

00:08:45.086 --> 00:08:47.301
I've told you a bunch of terrible things.

00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:50.722
You're like, "Oh my god, how bad is that?
What can I do about it?"

00:08:51.662 --> 00:08:53.815
Well, fortunately,

00:08:53.815 --> 00:08:55.857
we've identified that there's a problem.

00:08:55.857 --> 00:09:00.793
There's a lack of opportunity,
and that's due to unconscious bias.

00:09:01.713 --> 00:09:03.672
But you might be sitting 
there thinking,

00:09:03.672 --> 00:09:07.482
"I ain't brown. What's that got
to do with me?"

00:09:08.042 --> 00:09:10.466
Let me offer you a solution.

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:11.717
And as I've said before,

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:15.568
we live in a world where
we're looking for an ideal.

00:09:15.568 --> 00:09:17.208
And if we want to create a world

00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:19.809
where the circumstances
of your birth don't matter,

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.838
we all have to be part of the solution.

00:09:21.838 --> 00:09:24.913
And interestingly, the author
of the lab resume experiment

00:09:24.913 --> 00:09:26.514
offered some sort of a solution.

00:09:26.514 --> 00:09:30.248
She said the one thing that brought
the successful women together,

00:09:30.248 --> 00:09:32.227
the one thing that they had in common,

00:09:32.227 --> 00:09:34.694
was the fact that they had good mentors.

00:09:34.694 --> 00:09:37.139
So mentoring, we've all kind of
heard that before,

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:39.577
it's in the vernacular.

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:42.661
Here's another challenge for you.

00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:46.861
I challenge each and every one of you
to mentor someone different.

00:09:47.771 --> 00:09:48.988
Think about it.

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:52.034
Everyone wants to mentor someone
who kind of is familiar,

00:09:52.034 --> 00:09:52.893
who looks like us,

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:54.367
we have shared experiences.

00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:57.028
If I see a Muslim chick 
who's got a bit of attitude,

00:09:57.028 --> 00:09:58.881
I'm like, "What's up? We can hang out."

00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:02.117
You walk into a room and there's someone
who went to the same school,

00:10:02.117 --> 00:10:03.428
you play the same sports,

00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:06.982
there's a high chance that you're
going to want to help that person out.

00:10:07.016 --> 00:10:10.509
But for the person in the room
who has no shared experiences with you

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:13.415
it becomes extremely difficult 
to find that connection.

00:10:13.415 --> 00:10:15.834
The idea of finding someone 
different to mentor,

00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:18.505
someone who doesn't come
from the same background as you,

00:10:18.505 --> 00:10:19.988
whatever that background is,

00:10:19.988 --> 00:10:23.336
is about opening doors 
for people who couldn't even get

00:10:23.336 --> 00:10:25.331
to the damn hallway.

00:10:26.081 --> 00:10:29.566
Because ladies and gentlemen,
the world is not just.

00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:31.699
People are not born 
with equal opportunity.

00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:34.986
I was born in one of the poorest
cities in the world, Khartoum.

00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:37.107
I was born brown, I was born female,

00:10:37.107 --> 00:10:40.941
and I was born Muslim in a world
that is pretty suspicious of us

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:44.186
for reasons I can't control.

00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:48.156
However, I also acknowledge the fact
that I was born with privilege.

00:10:48.156 --> 00:10:49.825
I was born with amazing parents,

00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:51.430
I was given an education

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.067
and had the blessing
of migrating to Australia.

00:10:54.067 --> 00:10:56.658
But also, I've been blessed
with amazing mentors

00:10:56.658 --> 00:10:59.674
who've opened doors for me 
that I didn't even know were there.

00:10:59.674 --> 00:11:01.032
A mentor who said to me,

00:11:01.032 --> 00:11:02.635
"Hey, your story's interesting.

00:11:02.635 --> 00:11:05.862
Let's write something about it
so that I can share it with people."

00:11:05.862 --> 00:11:06.868
A mentor who said,

00:11:06.868 --> 00:11:10.219
"I know you're all those things that don't
belong on an Australian rig,

00:11:10.219 --> 00:11:11.548
but come on anyway."

00:11:11.548 --> 00:11:13.055
And here I am, talking to you.

00:11:13.055 --> 00:11:14.393
And I'm not the only one.

00:11:14.393 --> 00:11:16.862
There's all sorts of people
in my communities

00:11:16.862 --> 00:11:19.026
that I see have been
helped out by mentors.

00:11:19.026 --> 00:11:20.805
A young Muslim man in Sydney

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.973
who ended up using his mentor's help

00:11:23.973 --> 00:11:27.476
to start up a poetry slam in Bankstown

00:11:27.476 --> 00:11:29.098
and now it's a huge thing.

00:11:29.098 --> 00:11:32.218
And he's able to change the lives
of so many other young people.

00:11:32.218 --> 00:11:33.542
Or a lady here in Brisbane,

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:35.400
an Afghan lady who's a refugee,

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.151
who could barely speak English
when she came to Australia,

00:11:38.151 --> 00:11:40.030
her mentors helped her become a doctor

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.253
and she took our Young Queenslander 
of the Year Award in 2008.

00:11:43.253 --> 00:11:45.526
She's an inspiration.

00:11:50.366 --> 00:11:51.976
This is so not smooth.

00:11:54.376 --> 00:11:56.940
This is me.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.812
But I'm also the woman in the rig clothes,

00:11:59.812 --> 00:12:03.611
and I'm also the woman who was
in the abaya at the beginning.

00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:06.709
Would you have chosen to mentor me
if you had seen me

00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:08.962
in one of those other versions
of who I am?

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:11.470
Because I'm that same person.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.014
We have to look past our unconscious bias,

00:12:15.014 --> 00:12:18.206
find someone to mentor who's at
the opposite end of your spectrum

00:12:18.206 --> 00:12:20.591
because structural change takes time,

00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:24.707
and I don't have that level of patience.

00:12:24.707 --> 00:12:26.468
So if we're going to create a change,

00:12:26.468 --> 00:12:28.030
if we're going to create a world

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.286
where we all have
those kinds of opportunities,

00:12:30.286 --> 00:12:32.657
then choose to open doors for people.

00:12:32.657 --> 00:12:36.471
Because you might think that
diversity has nothing to do with you,

00:12:36.471 --> 00:12:38.205
but we are all part of this system

00:12:38.205 --> 00:12:40.301
and we can all be part of that solution.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.855
And if you don't know
where to find someone different,

00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:44.833
go to the places you wouldn't usually go.


00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:46.996
If you enroll in
private high school tutoring,

00:12:46.996 --> 00:12:48.463
go to your local state school

00:12:48.463 --> 00:12:51.893
or maybe just drop into your
local refugee tutoring center.

00:12:51.893 --> 00:12:53.616
Or perhaps you work at an office.

00:12:53.616 --> 00:12:56.614
Take out that new grad who looks
totally out of place --

00:12:56.614 --> 00:12:57.942
'cause that was me --

00:12:57.942 --> 00:12:59.270
and open doors for them,

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.900
not in a tokenistic way,
because we're not victims,

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.968
but show them the opportunities

00:13:03.968 --> 00:13:06.070
because opening up your world

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.741
will make you realize that 
you have access to doors

00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:10.565
that they didn't even know existed

00:13:10.565 --> 00:13:13.501
and you didn't even know
they didn't have.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.358
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:19.907
there is a problem in our community
with lack of opportunity,

00:13:19.907 --> 00:13:21.750
especially due to unconscious bias.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.782
But each and every one one of you
has the potential to change that.

00:13:25.782 --> 00:13:28.654
I know you've been given a lot
of challenges today,

00:13:28.654 --> 00:13:32.495
but if you can take this one piece
and think about it a little differently,

00:13:32.495 --> 00:13:35.736
because diversity is magic.

00:13:35.736 --> 00:13:39.554
And I encourage you to look past
your initial perceptions

00:13:39.554 --> 00:13:41.378
because I bet you,

00:13:41.378 --> 00:13:43.199
they're probably wrong.

00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:45.624
Thank you.

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:49.015
(Applause)
