WEBVTT

00:00:01.283 --> 00:00:03.504
The FBI is responsible
for more terrorism plots

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.175
in the United States

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:07.771
than any other organization.

00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:09.625
More than al Qaeda,

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:11.010
more than al Shabaab,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.560
more than the Islamic State,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.354
more than all of them combined.

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:18.011
This isn't likely how you
think about the FBI.

00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:22.066
You probably think of FBI agents
gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger,

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.207
or arresting corrupt politicians.

00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:26.858
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks,

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:28.331
the FBI became less concerned 


00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:30.940
with gangsters and 
crooked elected officials.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.402
The new target became terrorists,

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:36.823
and the pursuit of terrorists 
has consumed the FBI.

00:00:36.823 --> 00:00:39.618
Every year, the Bureau spends
3.3 billion dollars

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:42.222
on domestic counterterrorism activities.

00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:45.823
Compare than to just 2.6 billion dollars
combined for organized crime,

00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:47.999
financial fraud, public corruption


00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.777
and all other types of traditional
criminal activity.

00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:52.973
I've spent years pouring through
the case files

00:00:52.973 --> 00:00:55.805
of terrorism prosecutions in 
the United States,

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:58.074
and I've come to 
the conclusion that the FBI

00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:01.914
is much better at creating terrorists
than it is at catching terrorists.

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.097
In the 14 years since 9/11,

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:08.681
you can count about six real 
terrorist attacks in the United States.

00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.751
These include the Boston Marathon 
bombings in 2013,

00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:13.040
as well as failed attacks,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.505
such as the time when 
a man named Faisal Shahzad

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:18.077
tried to deliver a car bomb
to Times Square.

00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:20.122
In those same 14 years,

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:21.754
the Bureau, however, has bragged

00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:24.335
about how it's foiled dozens
of terrorism plots.

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:29.183
In all, the FBI has arrested
more than 175 people

00:01:29.183 --> 00:01:32.629
in aggressive, undercover 
conterterrorism stings.

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:35.467
These operations, which are usually
led by an informant,

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:37.293
provide the means and opportunity,

00:01:37.293 --> 00:01:39.225
and sometimes even the idea,

00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:42.081
for mentally ill and 
economically desperate people

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.291
to become what we now term terrorists.

00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:48.368
After 9/11, the FBI was given an edict:

00:01:48.368 --> 00:01:49.586
never again.

00:01:49.586 --> 00:01:52.707
Never another attack on American soil.

00:01:52.707 --> 00:01:55.667
FBI agents were told to find terrorists
before they struck.

00:01:55.667 --> 00:02:00.507
To do this, agents recruited a network
of more than 15,000 informants nationwide,

00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:03.276
all looking for anyone who 
might be dangerous.

00:02:03.276 --> 00:02:05.647
An informant can earn 
100,000 dollars or more

00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:08.752
for every terrorism case 
they bring to the FBI.

00:02:08.752 --> 00:02:12.025
That's right, the FBI is paying
mostly criminals and con men

00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:14.926
six figures to spy on communities
in the United States,

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:18.103
but mostly Muslim American communities.

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:21.277
These informants nab people like 
Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif

00:02:21.277 --> 00:02:23.148
and Walli Mujahidh.

00:02:23.148 --> 00:02:24.653
Both are mentally ill.

00:02:24.653 --> 00:02:28.016
Abdul-Latif had a history of huffing
gasoline and attempting suicide.

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:30.537
Mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder,

00:02:30.537 --> 00:02:33.745
he had trouble distinguishing between
reality and fantasy.

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:36.227
In 2012, the FBI arrested these two men

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:40.039
for conspiring to attack a military
recruiting station outside Seattle

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:44.363
with weapons provided, 
of course, by the FBI.

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:47.068
The FBI's informant was Robert Childs,

00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:49.027
a convicted rapist and child molester

00:02:49.027 --> 00:02:52.361
who was paid 90,000 dollars 
for his work on the case.

00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:53.849
This isn't an outlier.

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.671
In 2009, an FBI informant
who had fled Pakistan on murder charges

00:02:57.671 --> 00:03:00.995
led four men in a plot to bomb 
synagogues in the Bronx.

00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:03.526
The lead defendant was James Cromitie,

00:03:03.526 --> 00:03:06.476
a broke Walmart employee
with a history of mental problems.

00:03:06.476 --> 00:03:09.201
And the informant had offered 
him 250,000 dollars

00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:11.587
if he participated in that plot.

00:03:11.587 --> 00:03:14.232
There are many more examples.

00:03:14.232 --> 00:03:16.350
Today, The Intercept
published my new story

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.065
about a counterterrorism sting in Tampa
involving Sami Osmakac,

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:23.218
a young man who was living 
near Tampa, Florida.

00:03:23.218 --> 00:03:25.890
Osmakac also had 
schizoaffective disorder.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:26.895
He too was broke,

00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:29.932
and he had no connections to 
international terrorist groups.

00:03:29.932 --> 00:03:30.773
Nonetheless,

00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:34.617
an FBI informant gave him a job,
handed him money,

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:37.438
introduced him to an undercover agent
posing as a terrorist,

00:03:37.438 --> 00:03:40.727
and lured him in a plot
to bomb an Irish bar.

00:03:40.727 --> 00:03:42.684
But here's what's interesting:

00:03:42.684 --> 00:03:44.138
The lead undercover agent --

00:03:44.138 --> 00:03:46.776
you can see him in this picture
with his face blurred --

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:50.287
would go back to the Tampa field office
with his recording equipment on.

00:03:50.287 --> 00:03:51.608
Behind closed doors,

00:03:51.608 --> 00:03:54.987
FBI agents admitted that what
they were doing was farcical.

00:03:54.987 --> 00:03:58.216
A federal judge doesn't want you
to hear about these conversations.

00:03:58.216 --> 00:04:01.367
He sealed the transcripts and placed
them under a protective order

00:04:01.367 --> 00:04:04.784
in an attempt to prevent someone like me
from doing something like this.

00:04:05.574 --> 00:04:07.585
Behind closed doors, the lead agent,

00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:08.916
the squad supervisor,

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:10.551
described their would-be terrorist

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:13.182
as a "retarded fool who didn't have
a pot to piss in."

00:04:13.182 --> 00:04:15.009
They described his terrorist ambitions


00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:18.998
as wishy-washy and
a pipe dream scenario.

00:04:18.998 --> 00:04:20.756
But that didn't stop the FBI.

00:04:20.756 --> 00:04:24.092
They provided Sami Osmakac 
everything he needed.

00:04:24.092 --> 00:04:27.804
They gave him a car bomb,
they gave him an AK-47,

00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:30.386
they helped him make a so-called
martyrdom video,

00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:32.480
and they even gave 
him money for a taxi cab

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.944
so that he could get to where
they wanted him to go.

00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:37.814
As they were working the sting,

00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:41.327
the squad supervisor tells his agents
he wanted a Hollywood ending.

00:04:42.527 --> 00:04:44.168
And he got a Hollywood ending.

00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:47.609
When Sami Osmakac attempted
to deliver what he thought

00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:48.905
was a car bomb,

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:52.584
he was arrested, convicted and 
sentenced to 40 years in prison.

00:04:53.604 --> 00:04:56.223
Sami Osmakac isn't alone.

00:04:56.223 --> 00:04:58.825
He's one of more than 
175 so-called terrorists,

00:04:58.825 --> 00:05:01.803
for whom the FBI has created 
Hollywood endings.

00:05:03.813 --> 00:05:06.512
U.S. government officials call this
the War on Terror.

00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:08.759
It's really just theater,

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.089
a national security theater,

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:13.574
with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac

00:05:13.574 --> 00:05:16.621
unwitting actors in a 
carefully choreographed production

00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:18.829
brought to you by the FBI.

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:19.956
Thank you.

00:05:19.956 --> 00:05:22.870
(Applause)

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.421
Tom Rielly: So, those are some
pretty strong accusations,

00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:33.938
pretty strong charges.

00:05:35.098 --> 00:05:36.711
How can you back this up?

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.727
Trevor Aaronson: My research began in 2010

00:05:38.727 --> 00:05:41.795
when I received a grant from the 
Investigative Reporting Program

00:05:41.795 --> 00:05:42.730
at U.C. Berkeley,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.162
and a research assistant and I

00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:46.635
put together a database
of all terrorism prosecutions

00:05:46.635 --> 00:05:49.638
at the time during 
the first decade after 9/11.

00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:52.458
And we used the court file
to find out whether

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:55.881
the defendants had any connections
to international terrorist groups,

00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:57.364
whether an informant was used,

00:05:57.364 --> 00:06:00.506
and whether the informant
played the role of an agent provocateur

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:02.373
by providing the means and opportunity.

00:06:02.373 --> 00:06:03.950
And we submitted that to the FBI

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.064
and we asked them to respond
to our database.

00:06:06.064 --> 00:06:08.021
If they believed there were any errors,

00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:11.154
we asked them to tell us what they were
and we'd go back and check

00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:13.382
and they never challenged any
of our findings.

00:06:13.382 --> 00:06:15.580
Later, I used that data 
in a magazine article

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.629
and later in my book,

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:19.176
and on appearances on places
like CBS and NPR,

00:06:19.176 --> 00:06:21.083
they were offered that opportunity again

00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:23.333
to say, "Trevor Aaronson's 
findings are wrong."

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:25.193
And they've never
come forward and said,

00:06:25.193 --> 00:06:27.314
"These are the problems
with those findings."

00:06:27.314 --> 00:06:30.455
So the data has since been used 
by groups like Human Rights Watch

00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:33.157
on its recent report on 
these types of sting operations.

00:06:33.157 --> 00:06:35.796
And so far, the FBI has never 
really responded

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:39.022
to these charges that it's really
not catching terrorists

00:06:39.022 --> 00:06:41.167
so much as it's catching
mentally ill people

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:44.529
that it can dress up as terrorists 
in these types of sting operations.

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:49.327
TR: So The Intercept is that new
investigative journalism website,

00:06:49.327 --> 00:06:51.095
that's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald.

00:06:51.095 --> 00:06:54.674
Tell us about your article 
and why there.

00:06:54.674 --> 00:06:57.654
TA: The Intercept seemed to be
the most logical place for this

00:06:57.654 --> 00:07:00.723
because my article is 
really leveraging the fact that

00:07:00.723 --> 00:07:03.208
a source had leaked to me
transcripts of these

00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:06.155
private FBI conversations
that a federal judge had sealed

00:07:06.155 --> 00:07:08.556
based on the government's claim 
that their release

00:07:08.556 --> 00:07:10.748
would irreparably damage 
the U.S. government's

00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:12.852
law enforcement strategy.

00:07:12.852 --> 00:07:15.831
So a place like The Intercept
was set up to protect journalists

00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:16.890
and publish their work

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.719
when they're dealing with 
very sensitive matters like this.

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:22.618
So my story in The Intercept, 
which was just published today,

00:07:22.618 --> 00:07:25.953
tells the story of how Sami Osmakac
was set up in this FBI sting

00:07:25.953 --> 00:07:27.633
and goes into much greater detail.

00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:30.597
In this talk, I could only
highlight the things that they said,

00:07:30.597 --> 00:07:32.434
such as calling him a "retarded fool."

00:07:32.434 --> 00:07:33.916
But it was much more elaborate,

00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:37.012
they went to great lengths
to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands,

00:07:37.012 --> 00:07:40.068
which he then used to purchase weapons
from the undercover agent.

00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:41.208
When he went to trial,

00:07:41.208 --> 00:07:44.339
the central piece of evidence 
was that he paid for these weapons,

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.260
when in truth, these transcripts show
how the FBI orchestrated

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.660
someone who was essentially
mentally ill and broke

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.879
to get money to then 
pay for weapons

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:54.387
that they could then charge him
in a conspiracy for.

00:07:54.387 --> 00:07:56.514
TR: One final question.

00:07:56.514 --> 00:07:58.035
Less than 10 days ago,

00:07:58.035 --> 00:08:01.187
the FBI arrested some potential 
ISIS suspects in Brooklyn,

00:08:01.187 --> 00:08:04.715
saying that they might
be headed to Syria,

00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:07.622
and were those real,
or examples of more of the same?

00:08:07.622 --> 00:08:10.636
TA: Well so far, we only know
what's come out in the court file,

00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:13.641
but they seem to suggest it's another
example of the same.

00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:16.823
These types of sting operations 
have moved from flavor to flavor.

00:08:16.823 --> 00:08:18.991
So initially it was al Qaeda plots,

00:08:18.991 --> 00:08:21.305
and now the Islamic State
is the current flavor.

00:08:21.305 --> 00:08:24.874
What's worth noting about that case
is that the three men that were charged

00:08:24.874 --> 00:08:26.724
only began the plot to go to Syria

00:08:26.724 --> 00:08:28.801
after the introduction
of the FBI informant,

00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:32.251
and in fact, the FBI informant had helped
them with the travel documents

00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:33.167
that they needed.

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:35.784
In kind of a comical turn 
in that particular case,

00:08:35.784 --> 00:08:37.850
one of the defendant's mother
had found out

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.016
that he was interested in going to Syria
and had hid his passport.

00:08:41.016 --> 00:08:43.949
So it's unclear that even if he had
showed up at the airport,

00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:45.777
that he ever could have gone anywhere.

00:08:45.777 --> 00:08:49.420
So yes, there are people who might
be interested in joining the Islamic State

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.428
in the United States,

00:08:50.428 --> 00:08:54.050
and those are people that the United 
States government should be looking at

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.329
to see if they're interested
in violence here.

00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:59.509
In this particular case, given
the evidence that's so far come out,

00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:01.904
it suggests the FBI made
it possible for these guys

00:09:01.904 --> 00:09:03.984
to move along in a plan to go to Syria

00:09:03.984 --> 00:09:06.582
when they were never close 
to that in the first place.

00:09:06.592 --> 00:09:08.825
TR: Thanks a lot, that's amazing.
TA: Thank you.

00:09:08.825 --> 00:09:09.616
(Applause)
