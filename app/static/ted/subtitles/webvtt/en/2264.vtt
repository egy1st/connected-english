00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.246
Now, I've been making pictures
for quite a long time,

00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:05.638
and normally speaking,
a picture like this, for me,

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.565
should be straightforward.

00:00:07.565 --> 00:00:10.421
I'm in southern Ethiopia.
I'm with the Daasanach.

00:00:10.421 --> 00:00:13.532
There's a big family,
there's a very beautiful tree,

00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:16.110
and I make these pictures
with this very large,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.871
extremely cumbersome, very awkward
technical plate film camera.

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:23.331
Does anybody know
4x5 and 10x8 sheets of film,

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:26.860
and you're setting it up,
putting it on the tripod.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.715
I've got the family, spent the better part
of a day talking with them.

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:32.731
They sort of understand what I'm on about.

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:35.239
They think I'm a bit crazy,
but that's another story.

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.609
And what's most important for me
is the beauty and the aesthetic,

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.861
and that's based on the light.

00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:43.462
So the light's setting
on my left-hand side,

00:00:43.462 --> 00:00:47.096
and there's a balance
in the communication with the Daasanach,

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:48.640
the family of 30, all ages.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.577
There's babies and there's grandparents,

00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:53.543
I'm getting them in the tree
and waiting for the light to set,

00:00:53.543 --> 00:00:56.632
and it's going, going,
and I've got one sheet of film left,

00:00:56.632 --> 00:00:59.173
and I think, I'm okay,
I'm in control, I'm in control.

00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:02.745
I'm setting it up and I'm setting up,
and the light's just about to go,

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:05.426
and I want it to be golden,
I want it to be beautiful.

00:01:05.426 --> 00:01:08.472
I want it to be hanging on the horizon
so it lights these people,

00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:11.102
in all the potential glory
that they could be presented.

00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:13.151
And it's about to go 
and it's about to go,

00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:14.776
and I put my sheet in the camera,

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:15.628
it's all focused,

00:01:15.628 --> 00:01:17.913
and all of a sudden
there's a massive "whack,"

00:01:17.913 --> 00:01:20.687
and I'm looking around,
and in the top corner of the tree,

00:01:20.687 --> 00:01:22.766
one of the girls slaps
the girl next to her,

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:26.556
and the girl next to her pulls her hair,
and all hell breaks loose,

00:01:26.556 --> 00:01:29.290
and I'm standing there going,
"But the light, the light.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.580
Wait, I need the light.
Stay still! Stay still!"

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.780
And they start screaming,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.964
and then one of the men turns around
and starts screaming, shouting,

00:01:35.964 --> 00:01:39.397
and the whole tree collapses,
not the tree, but the people in the tree.

00:01:39.397 --> 00:01:43.017
They're all running around screaming,
and they run back off into the village

00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:46.799
in this sort of cloud of smoke, and I'm
left there standing behind my tripod.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.146
I've got my sheet, and the light's gone,
and I can't make the picture.

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:52.170
Where have they all gone? I had no idea.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.032
It took me a week, it took me a week to
make the picture which you see here today,

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:59.071
and I'll tell you why. (Applause)

00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:02.734
It's very, very, very simple --
I spent a week going around the village,

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:05.803
and I went to every single one:
"Hello, can you meet at the tree?

00:02:05.803 --> 00:02:07.592
What's your story? Who are you?"

00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:10.837
And it all turned out to be
about a boyfriend, for crying out loud.

00:02:10.837 --> 00:02:12.920
I mean, I have teenage kids.
I should know.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.593
It was about a boyfriend. The girl
on the top, she'd kissed the wrong boy,

00:02:16.593 --> 00:02:18.231
and they'd started having a fight.

00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:21.028
And there was a very, very beautiful
lesson for me in that:

00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:23.240
If I was going to photograph these people

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.784
in the dignified, respectful way
that I had intended,

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:28.297
and put them on a pedestal,
I had to understand them.

00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:31.587
It wasn't just about turning up.
It wasn't just about shaking a hand.

00:02:31.587 --> 00:02:34.642
It wasn't about just saying,
"I'm Jimmy, I'm a photographer."

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:36.812
I had to get to know
every single one of them,

00:02:36.812 --> 00:02:40.085
right down to whose boyfriend is who
and who is allowed to kiss who.

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:41.971
So in the end, a week later,

00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:43.472
and I was absolutely exhausted,

00:02:43.472 --> 00:02:46.243
I mean on my knees going,
"Please get back up in that tree.

00:02:46.243 --> 00:02:47.766
It's a picture I need to make."

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:50.455
They all came back.
I put them all back up in the tree.

00:02:50.455 --> 00:02:52.765
I made sure the girls
were in the right position,

00:02:52.765 --> 00:02:54.930
and the ones that slapped,
one was over there.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.488
They did look at each other.
If you look at it later,

00:02:57.488 --> 00:02:59.952
they're staring
at each other very angrily,

00:02:59.952 --> 00:03:01.943
and I've got the tree and everything,

00:03:01.943 --> 00:03:04.598
and then at the last minute, I go,
"The goat, the goat!

00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:08.307
I need something for the eye to look at.
I need a white goat in the middle."

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:10.896
So I swapped all the goats around.
I put the goats in.

00:03:10.896 --> 00:03:14.507
But even then I got it wrong, because
if you can see on the left-hand side,

00:03:14.507 --> 00:03:17.594
another little boy storms off
because I didn't choose his goat.

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:20.948
So the moral being I have to learn
to speak Goat as well as Daasanach.

00:03:20.948 --> 00:03:23.461
But anyway, the effort
that goes into that picture

00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:25.555
and the story that I've
just related to you,

00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:26.563
as you can imagine,

00:03:26.563 --> 00:03:29.099
there are hundreds of other
bizarre, eccentric stories

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.241
of hundreds of other people
around the world.

00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:34.723
And this was about four years ago,
and I set off on a journey,

00:03:34.723 --> 00:03:36.744
to be honest, a very indulgent journey.

00:03:36.744 --> 00:03:41.959
I'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist,
perhaps in some ways naive.

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.752
But I truly believe that there are people
on the planet that are beautiful.

00:03:45.752 --> 00:03:48.500
It's very, very simple.
It's not rocket science.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.512
I wanted to put
these people on a pedestal.

00:03:50.512 --> 00:03:53.995
I wanted to put them on a pedestal
like they'd never been seen before.

00:03:53.995 --> 00:03:58.022
So, I chose about 35 different groups,

00:03:58.022 --> 00:03:59.901
tribes, indigenous cultures.

00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:02.517
They were chosen purely
because of their aesthetic,

00:04:02.517 --> 00:04:04.374
and I'll talk more about that later.

00:04:04.374 --> 00:04:07.950
I'm not an anthropologist, I have
no technical study with the subject,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.852
but I do have a very,
very, very deep passion,

00:04:10.852 --> 00:04:14.324
and I believe that I had to choose
the most beautiful people on the planet

00:04:14.324 --> 00:04:16.910
in the most beautiful
environment that they lived in,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.215
and put the two together
and present them to you.

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:21.289
About a year ago,

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.402
I published the first pictures,

00:04:23.402 --> 00:04:27.419
and something extraordinarily
exciting happened.

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.973
The whole world came running,

00:04:28.973 --> 00:04:32.298
and it was a bizarre experience,
because everybody, from everywhere:

00:04:32.298 --> 00:04:34.629
"Who are they? What are they?
How many are they?

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.189
Where did you find them?
Are they real? You faked it.

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.619
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."
Millions of questions for which,

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:42.743
to be honest, I don't have the answers.

00:04:42.743 --> 00:04:44.423
I really didn't have the answers,

00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:48.246
and I could sort of understand, okay,
they're beautiful, that was my intention,

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.313
but the questions that I
was being fired at,

00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:52.356
I could not answer them.

00:04:52.356 --> 00:04:55.189
Until, it was quite amusing,
about a year ago

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:57.840
somebody said, "You've been
invited to do a TED Talk."

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.464
And I said, "Ted? Ted? Who's Ted?
I haven't met Ted before."

00:05:01.464 --> 00:05:04.021
He said, "No, a TED Talk."
I said, "But who's Ted?

00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:07.343
Do I have to talk to him or do we
sit with each other on the stage?"

00:05:07.343 --> 00:05:10.480
And, "No, no, the TED group.
You must know about it."

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.095
And I said, "I've been in a teepee
and in a yurt for the last five years.

00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:16.428
How do I know who Ted is?
Introduce me to him."

00:05:16.428 --> 00:05:19.767
Anyway, to cut a long story short,
he said, "We have to do a TED Talk."

00:05:19.767 --> 00:05:21.666
Researched. Oh, exciting. That's great!

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:24.140
And then eventually you're going
to go to TEDGlobal.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.274
Even more exciting.

00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:28.298
But what you need to do, you need
to teach the people lessons,

00:05:28.298 --> 00:05:31.350
lessons that you've learned
on your travels around the world

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.280
with these tribes.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.580
I thought, lessons, okay, well,
what did I learn? Good question.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.886
Three. You need three lessons,
and they need to be terribly profound.

00:05:38.886 --> 00:05:40.804
(Laughter)

00:05:40.804 --> 00:05:43.947
And I thought, three lessons, well,
I'm going to think about it.

00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:48.093
(Applause)

00:05:49.193 --> 00:05:52.540
So I thought long and hard,
and I stood here two days ago,

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.505
and I had my test run,
and I had my cards

00:05:54.505 --> 00:05:57.449
and my clicker in my hands
and my pictures were on the screen,

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.169
and I had my three lessons,
and I started presenting them,

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.563
and I had this very odd
out-of-body experience.

00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:05.417
I sort of looked at myself
standing there, going, "Oh, Jimmy,

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:07.233
this is complete loads of codswallop.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.417
All these people sitting here,
they've had more of these talks,

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:12.421
they've heard more lessons in their life.

00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:14.573
Who are you to tell them
what you've learned?

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:17.216
Who are you to guide them
and who are you to show them

00:06:17.216 --> 00:06:20.171
what is right, what is wrong,
what these people have to say?"

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.452
And I had a little bit of a,
it was very private,

00:06:22.452 --> 00:06:23.770
a little bit of a meltdown.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.907
I went back, and a little bit like the boy
walking away from the tree with his goats,

00:06:27.907 --> 00:06:31.158
very disgruntled, going, that didn't work,

00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:33.433
It wasn't what I wanted to communicate.

00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:37.035
And I thought long and hard about it,
and I thought, well, the only thing

00:06:37.035 --> 00:06:38.888
I can communicate is very, very basic.

00:06:38.888 --> 00:06:40.775
You have to turn it all the way around.

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:44.153
There's only one person
I know here, and that's me.

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:45.895
I'm still getting to know myself,

00:06:45.895 --> 00:06:49.330
and it's a lifelong journey, and I
probably won't have all the answers,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.440
but I did learn some extraordinary
things on this journey.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.597
So what I'm going to do
is share with you my lessons.

00:06:56.597 --> 00:07:00.323
It's a very, as I explained at the
beginning, very indulgent, very personal,

00:07:00.323 --> 00:07:02.654
how and why I made these pictures,

00:07:02.654 --> 00:07:05.889
and I leave it to you as the audience
to interpret what these lessons

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.537
have meant to me, what they could
perhaps mean to you.

00:07:10.377 --> 00:07:13.092
I traveled enormously as a child.

00:07:13.092 --> 00:07:15.613
I was very nomadic.
It was actually very exciting.

00:07:15.613 --> 00:07:17.424
All around the world,

00:07:17.424 --> 00:07:21.300
and I had this feeling that I
was pushed off at great speed

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.763
to become somebody,
become that individual, Jimmy.

00:07:23.763 --> 00:07:26.161
Go off into the planet,
and so I ran, and I ran,

00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:29.671
and my wife sometimes kids me,
"Jimmy, you look a bit like Forrest Gump,"

00:07:29.671 --> 00:07:32.008
but I'm, "No, it's all
about something, trust me."

00:07:32.008 --> 00:07:35.171
So I kept running and I kept running,
and I sort of got somewhere

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:38.342
and I sort of stood there and looked
around me and I thought, well,

00:07:38.342 --> 00:07:40.201
where do I belong? Where do I fit?

00:07:40.201 --> 00:07:43.513
What am I? Where am I from? I had no idea.

00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:46.590
So I hope there aren't too many
psychologists in this audience.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.980
Perhaps part of this journey

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.103
is about me trying to find out
where I belonged.

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:55.200
So whilst going, and don't worry, I didn't
when I arrived with these tribes,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.974
I didn't paint myself yellow and run
around with these spears and loincloths.

00:07:58.974 --> 00:08:01.900
But what I did find were people
that belonged themselves,

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.570
and they inspired me,
some extraordinary people,

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.380
and I'd like to introduce you
to some heroes of mine.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.272
They're the Huli.

00:08:09.272 --> 00:08:13.382
Now, the Huli are some of the most
extraordinarily beautiful people

00:08:13.382 --> 00:08:14.659
on the planet.

00:08:14.659 --> 00:08:18.631
They're proud. They live in
the Papua New Guinean highlands.

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:21.730
There's not many of them left,
and they're called the Huli wigmen.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.808
And images like this, I mean,
this is what it's all about for me.

00:08:24.808 --> 00:08:28.298
And you've spent weeks and months there
talking with them, getting there,

00:08:28.298 --> 00:08:31.547
and I want to put them on a pedestal,
and I said, "You have something

00:08:31.547 --> 00:08:33.080
that many people have not seen.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.735
You sit in this stunning nature."

00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:38.016
And it really does look like this,
and they really do look like this.

00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:39.217
This is the real thing.

00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:42.271
And you know why they're proud?
You know why they look like this,

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:44.064
and why I broke my back literally

00:08:44.064 --> 00:08:46.238
to photograph them
and present them to you?

00:08:46.238 --> 00:08:48.740
It's because they have
these extraordinary rituals.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.263
And the Huli have this ritual:
When they're teenagers,

00:08:51.263 --> 00:08:54.140
becoming a man,
they have to shave their heads,

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.262
and they spend the rest of their life
shaving their heads every single day,

00:08:58.262 --> 00:09:00.226
and what they do with that hair,

00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:02.130
they make it into a creation,

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.126
a creation that's
a very personal creation.

00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:06.379
It's their creation.
It's their Huli creation.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.422
So they're called the Huli wigmen.

00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:10.279
That's a wig on his head.

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:12.035
It's all made out of his human hair.

00:09:12.035 --> 00:09:15.573
And then they decorate that wig with
the feathers of the birds of paradise,

00:09:15.573 --> 00:09:17.821
and don't worry,
there are many birds there.

00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:21.033
There's very few people living,
so nothing to get too upset about,

00:09:21.033 --> 00:09:23.940
and they spend the rest of their life
recreating these hats

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.494
and getting further
and further,

00:09:25.494 --> 00:09:27.898
and it's extraordinary,
and there's another group,

00:09:27.898 --> 00:09:30.930
they're called the Kalam,
and they live in the next valley,

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.148
but they speak a completely
different language,

00:09:33.148 --> 00:09:35.620
they look completely different,
and they wear a hat,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.217
and it's built out of scarabs,

00:09:37.217 --> 00:09:39.530
these fantastic emerald green
little scarabs,

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.637
and sometimes there are 5,000
or 6,000 scarabs in this hat,

00:09:42.637 --> 00:09:45.680
and they spend the whole of their life
collecting these scarabs

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.698
to build these hats.

00:09:46.698 --> 00:09:50.622
So the Huli inspired me
in that they belong.

00:09:50.622 --> 00:09:54.198
Perhaps I have to work harder
at finding a ritual which matters for me

00:09:54.198 --> 00:09:58.679
and going back into my past
to see where I actually fit.

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:01.349
An extremely important part
of this project

00:10:01.349 --> 00:10:07.270
was about how I photograph
these extraordinary people.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.660
And it's basically beauty.
I think beauty matters.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.120
We spend the whole of our existence
revolving around beauty:

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.788
beautiful places, beautiful things,
and ultimately, beautiful people.

00:10:17.788 --> 00:10:19.808
It's very, very, very significant.

00:10:19.808 --> 00:10:22.595
I've spent all of my life analyzing
what do I look like?

00:10:22.595 --> 00:10:24.332
Am I perceived as beautiful?

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.705
Does it matter if I'm
a beautiful person or not,

00:10:26.705 --> 00:10:28.678
or is it purely based on my aesthetic?

00:10:28.678 --> 00:10:31.604
And then when I went off,
I came to a very narrow conclusion.

00:10:31.604 --> 00:10:35.156
Do I have to go around the world
photographing, excuse me,

00:10:35.156 --> 00:10:38.954
women between the age of 25 and 30?
Is that what beauty is going to be?

00:10:38.954 --> 00:10:42.409
Is everything before and after that
utterly irrelevant?

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.653
And it was only until I went on a journey,

00:10:44.653 --> 00:10:47.440
a journey that was so extreme,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.048
I still get shivers when I think about it.

00:10:50.048 --> 00:10:53.197
I went to a part of the world,
and I don't know whether any of you

00:10:53.197 --> 00:10:56.402
have ever heard of Chukotka.
Has anybody ever heard of Chukotka?

00:10:56.402 --> 00:11:00.929
Chukotka probably is, technically,
as far as one can go

00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:04.691
and still be on the living planet.

00:11:04.691 --> 00:11:06.757
It's 13 hours' flight from Moscow.

00:11:06.757 --> 00:11:10.605
First you've got to get to Moscow, and
then 13 hours' flight nonstop from Moscow.

00:11:10.605 --> 00:11:13.326
And that's if you get there.

00:11:13.326 --> 00:11:15.851
As you can see, some people
sort of miss the runway.

00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:18.860
And then when you land there,
in Chukotka are the Chukchis.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.151
Now, the Chukchis are the last
indigenous Inuits of Siberia,

00:11:22.151 --> 00:11:25.344
and they're people I'd heard about,
I'd hardly seen any images of,

00:11:25.344 --> 00:11:26.740
but I knew they were there,

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.734
and I'd been in touch with this guide,

00:11:28.734 --> 00:11:29.773
and this guide said,

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:32.810
"There's this fantastic tribe.
There's only about 40 of them.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.000
You'll be okay. We'll find them."
So off we went on this journey.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.062
When we arrived there, after a month
of traveling across the ice,

00:11:39.062 --> 00:11:42.386
and we'd got to them, but then
I was not allowed to photograph them.

00:11:42.386 --> 00:11:44.955
They said, "You cannot photograph us.
You have to wait.

00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:49.138
You have to wait until you get to know us.
You have to wait until you understand us.

00:11:49.138 --> 00:11:52.264
You have to wait until you see
how we interact with one another."

00:11:52.264 --> 00:11:55.202
And only then, it was many,
many weeks later, I saw a respect.

00:11:55.202 --> 00:11:56.736
They had zero judgment.

00:11:56.736 --> 00:12:00.334
They observed one another, from the youth,
from the middle aged to the old.

00:12:00.334 --> 00:12:02.600
They need each other.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.630
The children need to chew the meat all day

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.779
because the adults don't have any teeth,

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:09.737
but at the same time, the children
take the old aged people out

00:12:09.737 --> 00:12:11.707
to the toilet because they're infirm,

00:12:11.707 --> 00:12:13.992
so there's this fantastic
community of respect.

00:12:13.992 --> 00:12:17.750
And they adore and admire one another,
and they truly taught me

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.513
what beauty was.

00:12:19.513 --> 00:12:22.113
(Applause)

00:12:22.113 --> 00:12:25.061
Now I'm going to ask for a little bit
of audience interaction.

00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:27.618
This is extremely important
for the end of my talk.

00:12:27.618 --> 00:12:30.249
If you could look at somebody
left to the right of you,


00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.233
and I want you to observe them,

00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:35.411
and I want you to give them a compliment.
This is very important.

00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:39.434
Now, it may be their nose or their hair
or even their aura, I don't mind,

00:12:39.434 --> 00:12:42.477
but please look at each other,
give them a compliment.

00:12:42.477 --> 00:12:45.170
You have to be quick,
because I'm running out of time.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.140
And you have to remember it.

00:12:49.768 --> 00:12:53.970
Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you,
you've given each other compliments.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.546
Hold that compliment very, very tightly.
Hold it for later.

00:12:57.546 --> 00:13:01.980
And the last thing, it was
extraordinarily profound,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.659
and it happened only two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba.

00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:08.763
Now, the Himba live in northern Namibia
on the border of Angola,

00:13:08.763 --> 00:13:10.690
and I'd been there a few times before,


00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.039
and I'd gone back
to present this book I'd made,

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:15.960
to show them the pictures,
to get into a discussion with them,

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.830
to say, "This is how I saw you.
This is how I love you.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.143
This is how I respect you. What
do you think? Am I right? Am I wrong?"

00:13:22.143 --> 00:13:25.216
So I wanted this debate.
It was very, very, very emotional,

00:13:25.216 --> 00:13:27.657
and one night we were sitting
around the campfire,

00:13:27.657 --> 00:13:31.279
and I have to be honest, I think I'd had
a little bit too much to drink,

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:34.826
and I was sort of sitting under the stars
going, "This is great,

00:13:34.826 --> 00:13:37.450
you've seen my pictures,
we love each other." (Laughter)

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.592
And I'm a little bit slow,

00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:42.503
and I looked around me, and I said,

00:13:42.503 --> 00:13:44.805
I thought, maybe, the fence is missing.

00:13:44.805 --> 00:13:46.900
Wasn't there a fence here
last time I came?

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.958
You know, this big
protective fence around the village,

00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.672
and they sort of looked at me
and go, "Yeah, chief die."

00:13:52.672 --> 00:13:55.138
And I thought, okay,
chief dying, right, you know,

00:13:55.138 --> 00:13:57.529
look up at the stars again,
look at the campfire.

00:13:57.529 --> 00:14:01.399
Chief die. What on Earth does
chief die have to do with the fence?

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:04.416
"Chief die.

00:14:04.416 --> 00:14:06.854
First we destroy, yeah?
Then we reflect.

00:14:06.854 --> 00:14:10.708
Then we rebuild. Then we respect."

00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:14.656
And I burst out in tears, because
my father had only just died

00:14:14.656 --> 00:14:16.490
prior to this journey,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.161
and I didn't ever acknowledge him,

00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:22.120
I didn't ever appreciate him for the fact
that I'm probably standing here today

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.233
because of him.

00:14:24.233 --> 00:14:29.259
These people taught me that we are only
who we are because of our parents

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:31.535
and our grandparents
and our forefathers

00:14:31.535 --> 00:14:33.346
going on and on and on before that,

00:14:33.346 --> 00:14:37.432
and I, no matter how romantic
or how idealistic I am on this journey,

00:14:37.432 --> 00:14:39.789
I did not know that until two weeks ago.

00:14:39.789 --> 00:14:42.738
I did not know that until two weeks ago.

00:14:42.738 --> 00:14:45.519
So what's this all about?

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:47.776
Well, there's an image
I'd like to show you,

00:14:47.776 --> 00:14:51.505
quite a special image, and it wasn't
essentially the image I wanted to choose.

00:14:51.505 --> 00:14:55.303
I was sitting there the other day,
and I have to finish on a strong image.

00:14:55.303 --> 00:14:59.162
And somebody said, "You have to show
them the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets."

00:14:59.162 --> 00:15:01.830
I was like, yeah, but that's not
my favorite picture.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.528
She went, "No no no no no no no.
It's an amazing picture.

00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:05.581
You're in his eyes."

00:15:05.581 --> 00:15:09.120
I said, "What do you mean I'm in his eyes?
It's a picture of the Nenets."

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.709
She said, "No, look, look closely,
you're in his eyes."

00:15:11.709 --> 00:15:15.871
And when you look closely at this picture,
there is a reflection of me in his eyes,

00:15:15.871 --> 00:15:19.260
so I think perhaps he has my soul,
and I'm in his soul,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.438
and whilst these pictures look at you,
I ask you to look at them.

00:15:22.438 --> 00:15:25.126
You may not be reflected in his eyes,

00:15:25.126 --> 00:15:28.502
but there is something extraordinarily
important about these people.

00:15:28.502 --> 00:15:32.570
I don't ultimately have the answers,
as I've just shared with you,

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.818
but you must do.
There must be something there.

00:15:34.818 --> 00:15:38.440
So if you can briefly reflect
on what I was discussing

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.641
about beauty and about belonging
and about our ancestors and our roots,

00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:47.123
and I need you all
to stand for me, please.

00:15:47.123 --> 00:15:49.068
(Laughter)

00:15:49.068 --> 00:15:51.368
Now you have no excuse.
It's almost lunchtime,

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:53.902
and this is not a standing ovation,
so don't worry,

00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:55.784
I'm not fishing for compliments.

00:15:55.784 --> 00:15:58.384
But you were given a compliment
a few minutes ago.

00:15:58.384 --> 00:16:00.711
Now I want you to stand tall.

00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:02.895
I want you to breathe in.
This is what I say.

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:05.236
I'm not going to get
on my knees for two weeks.

00:16:05.236 --> 00:16:07.324
I'm not going to ask you
to carry a goat,

00:16:07.324 --> 00:16:09.345
and I know you don't have any camels.

00:16:09.345 --> 00:16:11.219
Photography's extraordinarily powerful.

00:16:11.219 --> 00:16:13.407
It's this language which
we now all understand.

00:16:13.407 --> 00:16:15.264
We truly do all understand it,

00:16:15.264 --> 00:16:17.749
and we have this global
digital fireplace, don't we,

00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:19.720
but I want to share you with the world,

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.185
because you are also a tribe.

00:16:21.185 --> 00:16:24.493
You are the TED tribe, yeah?
But you have to remember that compliment.

00:16:24.493 --> 00:16:27.734
You have to stand tall,
breathe in through your nose,

00:16:27.734 --> 00:16:29.702
and I'm going to photograph you. Okay?

00:16:29.702 --> 00:16:32.646
I need to do a panoramic shot,
so it's going to take a minute,

00:16:32.646 --> 00:16:34.227
so you have to concentrate, okay?

00:16:34.227 --> 00:16:37.496
Breathe in, stand tall, no laughing.
Shh, breathe through your nose.

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:38.950
I'm going to photograph.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:43.682
(Clicks)
