00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:18.636
I bought new shoes,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.358
and I wanted to show them to you.

00:00:21.918 --> 00:00:23.647
I bought them from this guy.

00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:26.087
His name is Catalino.

00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:29.760
He's been living at the North Rosario
train station for 20 years.

00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:34.781
Here's Catalino giving me his shoes.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.626
I bought them especially for this talk,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.559
because for me,
it's a very special occasion,

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.882
and I wanted to wear new shoes.

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:49.179
I studied advertising in Buenos Aires.

00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:52.194
We were once given an assignment

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.437
to go out into the street,
change something,

00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:57.512
and then observe people's reactions.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.754
So I dressed the way I'm dressed today,

00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:03.523
and I went to the Obelisco monument,

00:01:03.547 --> 00:01:05.936
and when cars stopped at the light,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.491
instead of asking for money,
I gave them one peso.

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:13.769
What did I learn?

00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:15.594
I realized how prejudiced people are.

00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:18.119
Because as soon as they saw me
approaching their car,

00:01:18.143 --> 00:01:20.404
they closed the window
or looked straight ahead,

00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:23.915
pretending nobody was there.

00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:28.323
That created an uncomfortable situation,

00:01:28.347 --> 00:01:31.022
which would last until the next red light,

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:34.442
when they'd become uncomfortable
again, ignoring another person.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.748
Women would usually put
their purses in the back seat.

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:42.099
The exercise was a success,

00:01:42.123 --> 00:01:46.207
and that's how I got my first job
at Agulla y Baccetti.

00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:49.565
Later, I worked at Vega Olmos Ponce,

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:54.874
and in 2001, I escaped all the rioting

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:57.630
by going to London
with a thousand dollars,

00:01:57.654 --> 00:02:00.725
a tourist visa, and speaking
no English at all.

00:02:01.598 --> 00:02:05.240
I survived one year,
I worked washing dishes,

00:02:05.264 --> 00:02:08.338
building scaffolding
for construction sites,

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:11.479
and installing heating and AC systems.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.285
I returned from London,

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:17.800
having been deported for working illegally
and at double the allotted hours,

00:02:17.824 --> 00:02:21.035
but it was the best experience of my life.

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:26.975
I returned to work in advertising
for two years in a new agency,

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:31.876
until I got an offer
from an agency in New York,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.734
which I took without a second thought.

00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:37.444
But this time I had a paid apartment
across from the Empire State Building,

00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:39.699
and a salary of US $60,000 a year.

00:02:40.763 --> 00:02:42.598
A completely different experience,

00:02:42.622 --> 00:02:46.497
but one that I could really
appreciate after London.

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.954
Then I met my girlfriend.

00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:53.280
Soon after we moved in together,

00:02:53.304 --> 00:02:56.639
I got a call from another agency
in Austin, Texas,

00:02:56.663 --> 00:02:57.859
offering me a job.

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.954
I told them, "Listen, I just moved in
with my girlfriend a month ago.

00:03:01.978 --> 00:03:04.492
I can't accept the offer,
she has a job here."

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:06.604
And they said,
"We'll give her a job, too."

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.990
So we went to Austin for a weekend,
we liked the city, and we moved there.

00:03:11.014 --> 00:03:12.316
We arrived on a Sunday,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.955
and on Monday we found out
she was pregnant.

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.692
So we got married; I flew
my parents in from Argentina,

00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:22.145
and we got married
in Puerto Rico, pregnant.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.490
We got married pregnant,
but we were really happy.

00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:31.647
In 2009 Elena was born.
She is the love of my life.

00:03:31.671 --> 00:03:33.170
She's the baby in the photo.

00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:37.607
When Elena was a year and a half old,

00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.576
I got a call from my brother.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.530
I was having lunch,

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:46.256
and he told me that my parents
had been in a really bad car accident.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.978
He didn't even know how they were,

00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:50.263
only that they were in serious condition.

00:03:50.287 --> 00:03:53.216
It had happened near Rafaela,
coming from Santiago Del Estero.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.651
There was no other news.

00:03:54.675 --> 00:03:57.110
Having no other information,
I hopped on a plane.

00:03:57.134 --> 00:03:59.317
A friend was waiting for me
at Ezeiza Airport.

00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:00.491
He took me to Rafaela.

00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:02.912
And I was met with this.

00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:07.250
I learned that my father was in coma.

00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:10.938
(Sobs)

00:04:11.354 --> 00:04:14.531
All of my mom's bones were broken.

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:18.601
My dad was in a coma
for 10 months until he died.

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:22.550
My mom was in bed for six months,
and had six surgeries.

00:04:25.216 --> 00:04:29.263
This was the last time
I held my father's hand.

00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:31.908
At first, he would listen
to me and respond,

00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:34.564
but then later, he stopped responding.

00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:43.978
So I went back to Austin to work --
I had to keep working.

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:50.192
There was a day, five months
before my father died ...

00:04:52.113 --> 00:04:54.478
My wife and I had an argument
in the morning,

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:56.716
and I left for work, slamming the door.

00:04:57.758 --> 00:05:01.012
The next day I was served
with divorce papers.

00:05:01.036 --> 00:05:02.255
I was left on the street.

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.728
I lost my daughter, I lost my house,

00:05:04.752 --> 00:05:07.222
and with my parents' situation
back in Argentina,

00:05:07.246 --> 00:05:08.514
I was completely alone.

00:05:08.538 --> 00:05:11.806
I went to stay with a friend,
and sleep on his couch.

00:05:12.497 --> 00:05:16.451
At that time I was using Instagram,
like everyone else,

00:05:16.475 --> 00:05:19.957
taking pictures of the sky, a bird,
whatever crossed my path.

00:05:20.343 --> 00:05:23.591
Until one day I met this man.

00:05:24.503 --> 00:05:27.829
I asked if I could take his picture,
and paid him a dollar for it.

00:05:27.853 --> 00:05:30.899
We started chatting
and he told me his story.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:37.124
And suddenly all my problems
became very small compared to his story.

00:05:37.148 --> 00:05:40.355
It helped me to appreciate
all the things I had,

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:42.115
which were quite a few:

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.732
I was healthy, my daughter was healthy,

00:05:44.756 --> 00:05:47.675
and I had a couch to sleep on,
which is a lot.

00:05:48.907 --> 00:05:50.439
Since that day,

00:05:50.463 --> 00:05:54.392
I focused on taking portraits
of people who lived in the streets.

00:05:54.976 --> 00:06:01.069
I found in them the family I lacked,
the support I needed.

00:06:02.608 --> 00:06:05.324
Their stories made me
appreciate everything I had.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.829
I started gaining followers.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.951
I always uploaded a person's picture
along with their name,

00:06:13.975 --> 00:06:16.808
plus a bit of their story
if I found it interesting.

00:06:19.272 --> 00:06:22.635
I found in them the family I was missing.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.342
One day I met this guy.

00:06:26.128 --> 00:06:29.659
We talked, I took his picture,
paid him a dollar.

00:06:29.683 --> 00:06:31.954
And before I left, he told me,

00:06:31.978 --> 00:06:34.802
"Do you know the only thing
I'd like to do before I die?"

00:06:34.826 --> 00:06:37.133
I said, "No." And he said, "Oktoberfest!"

00:06:37.157 --> 00:06:38.306
(Laughs)

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.498
"Oktoberfest?"

00:06:39.522 --> 00:06:42.365
He told me he was of German descent,

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.731
and he had always dreamed
of visiting Germany.

00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:46.482
We laughed and I went to work.

00:06:47.113 --> 00:06:49.002
And on my way to work --

00:06:49.026 --> 00:06:52.633
at that point, I had
like 5,000 followers on Instagram --

00:06:52.657 --> 00:06:54.289
on my way to work,

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:59.660
I had the idea that if every follower
I had donated one dollar,

00:06:59.684 --> 00:07:01.679
which is what I paid for each portrait,

00:07:01.703 --> 00:07:03.827
I could take this guy to Germany,

00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:06.239
and write a book about the experience.

00:07:06.263 --> 00:07:08.534
I started dreaming about it.

00:07:09.423 --> 00:07:13.027
Without much thinking, I uploaded
his picture with the headline:

00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:15.386
"Who wants to take this guy
to Oktoberfest?"

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:21.284
I opened a Paypal account,
I created a site called One Dollar Dreams.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.141
Suddenly, a lady from Japan
sent me 100 dollars,

00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:27.552
a guy from South Africa sent five,

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:30.268
a guy from the United States sent two ...

00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:34.940
I realized I had a good idea, a big idea.

00:07:36.713 --> 00:07:38.895
My father died around that time,

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:41.930
and I have a friend who lives
in Colombia who said,

00:07:41.954 --> 00:07:44.303
"Why don't you come and stay with me?

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.168
Forget about your problems for a while."

00:07:47.502 --> 00:07:50.092
I bought a ticket using miles,
and went to Colombia.

00:07:50.416 --> 00:07:52.643
In Colombia, I took pictures.

00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:56.343
While my friend was at work,
I went out and took pictures,

00:07:56.367 --> 00:07:58.659
I listened to stories
and wrote down names.

00:08:00.286 --> 00:08:05.461
I found a completely different reality
from the one in the United States,

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.528
like in any other Latin American country.

00:08:07.552 --> 00:08:10.992
The reality of the people who live
on the streets here is very different.

00:08:12.372 --> 00:08:13.664
I met this guy,

00:08:13.688 --> 00:08:16.464
who asked me for money to buy shoes.

00:08:16.488 --> 00:08:19.711
And since I knew he was going
to spend the money on something else,

00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:21.476
I went with him to buy them.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.196
Here he is trying on the shoes.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.706
Here he is, happy with his new shoes.

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.950
I kept taking pictures until I met --

00:08:31.974 --> 00:08:34.107
this is how people sleep in Colombia.

00:08:35.232 --> 00:08:38.628
And it's part of the landscape,
we don't even notice them.

00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:42.001
See how people keep on walking,
as if he didn’t exist.

00:08:42.025 --> 00:08:43.868
He might as well be another trash can.

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:47.230
Look how close that bus passes by.

00:08:50.783 --> 00:08:53.997
I met this guy, whose name is Alex.

00:08:54.727 --> 00:08:58.655
Alex was from a small, inland town
and moved to Medellin

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:00.623
to play the guitar on buses.

00:09:00.647 --> 00:09:02.237
He was addicted to crack cocaine.

00:09:03.258 --> 00:09:06.154
One day he went to buy drugs,
and when he finished,

00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:08.485
they cut him with a knife
and stole the drugs,

00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:10.134
his guitar, his shoes, everything.

00:09:10.158 --> 00:09:12.380
He'd been living on the streets
for three days,

00:09:12.404 --> 00:09:14.324
his feet were swollen, he couldn't walk.

00:09:14.348 --> 00:09:16.753
In his hand he had a card
from a rehab center.

00:09:17.853 --> 00:09:20.605
He told me he couldn't handle it anymore.

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:23.960
He had asked the police
to give him a ride to the center,

00:09:23.984 --> 00:09:25.134
but they ignored him.

00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:29.712
Then I asked him
if he really wanted to quit.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:32.164
He said it was what he wanted
more than anything --

00:09:32.188 --> 00:09:33.456
he couldn't take any more.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.607
So we got into a cab
and I took him to rehab,

00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:36.968
I became his guardian.

00:09:36.992 --> 00:09:40.638
Alex was in rehab for ten months
until he left and got a job.

00:09:42.645 --> 00:09:46.706
I went back to Austin, and the agency
sent me to Mexico for a commercial shoot.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.355
After the shoot, I stayed
over the weekend with a friend,

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:52.909
and took pictures.

00:09:52.933 --> 00:09:54.949
That boy is the first picture I took.

00:09:54.973 --> 00:09:58.614
He was painted as a clown,
asking for money at the traffic light,

00:09:58.638 --> 00:10:02.469
and his parents were at the corner
drinking wine and waiting for the money.

00:10:03.526 --> 00:10:06.152
This is Mexico.
Lots of kids on the streets.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:12.682
I kept gathering stories
and telling them over Instagram.

00:10:15.126 --> 00:10:20.105
I gained more followers;
people gave me encouragement,

00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:25.210
which helped me a lot, personally,

00:10:25.234 --> 00:10:29.624
and also because I've always
worked in advertising.

00:10:29.648 --> 00:10:33.261
I like ideas, I'm passionate
about ideas and solving problems,

00:10:33.285 --> 00:10:40.254
but I'm not passionate about selling
cheese puffs for Monsanto, you know?

00:10:40.608 --> 00:10:45.337
So I found in this project
something that really filled my life.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.390
I had to go Los Angeles
to edit a commercial,

00:10:49.414 --> 00:10:52.675
and I had to do it
from Wednesday to Thursday.

00:10:53.231 --> 00:10:58.193
I didn't have any money, so I spent
the weekend on the street.

00:10:58.217 --> 00:11:02.401
I spent the weekend sharing
the experience live on Instagram.

00:11:03.755 --> 00:11:06.959
I took pictures in Los Angeles,
and then went back to Austin,

00:11:06.983 --> 00:11:09.306
where I found this man.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.503
He was an unemployed chef.

00:11:11.995 --> 00:11:16.693
I took him to a store and bought him
all kinds of chef equipment,

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:17.964
plus a set of knives.

00:11:17.988 --> 00:11:19.735
We went to different restaurants,

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:23.376
and I offered to advertise
for them over my social networks,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.925
if they would give him a job.

00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:27.157
He got a job at the first place we went.

00:11:28.737 --> 00:11:30.794
I was invited to give a speech in Uruguay,

00:11:30.818 --> 00:11:33.585
I went 10 days early,
and took pictures there.

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:37.526
I took a guy from the street
to the conference.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.065
This guy, Sebastián.

00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:42.270
And I did the opposite
to what I did here today --

00:11:42.628 --> 00:11:45.825
I dressed him up like an advertising exec,

00:11:45.849 --> 00:11:48.386
complete with a hotel room
and new clothes,

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.976
so he mixed in with the people
attending the festival.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.060
I realized that a person's appearance
can have the opposite effect.

00:11:55.084 --> 00:11:58.246
If you're well-dressed, no matter
if you're alcoholic or homeless,

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.428
people respect you.

00:12:00.563 --> 00:12:04.177
Then I went to Spain to visit a friend --

00:12:04.201 --> 00:12:06.547
it's great to have friends
all over the world.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.506
I took pictures in Madrid for 10 days,

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.783
and through Instagram a journalist
asked me for an interview.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.123
After the interview, she offered to let me
use her apartment in Barcelona,

00:12:20.147 --> 00:12:23.488
so I stayed there for 10 days,
taking pictures.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.879
All this is Spain -- I took
lots of pictures in Spain.

00:12:29.903 --> 00:12:32.656
After Spain, I was invited
to El Salvador to speak,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.541
and I did the same, went 10 days
early to take pictures.

00:12:35.565 --> 00:12:37.074
For my talk,

00:12:37.098 --> 00:12:41.405
I contacted the mother of a guy
in the audience without his knowing.

00:12:41.429 --> 00:12:48.378
I dressed her as a homeless person,
and took pictures of her.

00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:51.427
Then when I was showing
the photos as I'm doing now,

00:12:51.451 --> 00:12:57.068
suddenly this guy's mother
appeared on screen, this one.

00:12:58.462 --> 00:13:00.267
Nobody knew but him.

00:13:00.291 --> 00:13:05.211
Now he will no longer see
the homeless the same way.

00:13:05.235 --> 00:13:09.906
Why? Because our perspective changes
when that person is a loved one.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.329
It changes when we care about them.

00:13:12.353 --> 00:13:15.225
And those people on the streets
are someone's brothers,

00:13:15.249 --> 00:13:17.851
someone's children,
someone's mother, all of them.

00:13:19.444 --> 00:13:21.567
After that I returned to Austin,

00:13:21.591 --> 00:13:25.426
and wanted to do a larger study
of the United States,

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.457
because I had only
looked at Austin and L.A.

00:13:29.029 --> 00:13:30.709
I had no money,

00:13:30.733 --> 00:13:35.528
and as usual, I took my car
and left with thousand dollars,

00:13:35.552 --> 00:13:38.941
the same amount of money
I had when going to London.

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:41.736
So I set out.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.800
I was on the road for two months;
I traveled ten thousand miles.

00:13:47.407 --> 00:13:54.392
I went to Las Vegas, Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Denver,

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:58.039
Saint Louis, Detroit, New York,

00:13:58.063 --> 00:14:01.944
Washington, Atlanta, Miami, Key West,

00:14:01.968 --> 00:14:05.108
New Orleans and I returned to Austin.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.637
People opened their homes to me,

00:14:09.661 --> 00:14:13.591
they gave me money, food,
and a lot of support.

00:14:13.615 --> 00:14:19.236
In San Francisco, I invited
a homeless guy to come with me,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.220
and we traveled together for a month.

00:14:21.244 --> 00:14:22.664
I left him in Key West.

00:14:23.173 --> 00:14:24.701
The trip was a success.

00:14:25.538 --> 00:14:28.574
And finally, I want to talk about luck.

00:14:29.996 --> 00:14:31.273
The importance of luck.

00:14:31.297 --> 00:14:36.407
Because we often discriminate
against people for their appearance,

00:14:36.431 --> 00:14:38.898
but we don't consider that it's all luck.

00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:44.041
You are very lucky to be here today,
well-dressed, listening to this talk.

00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:46.735
Luck is a major factor,

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:48.785
not only in what we get from life,

00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:50.679
but also in the decisions we make.

00:14:50.703 --> 00:14:53.809
Because that determines
how you make decisions later.

00:14:54.414 --> 00:14:56.741
For example, this hat that I'm wearing

00:14:56.765 --> 00:14:59.308
is the result of an alcoholic
and abusive father.

00:14:59.737 --> 00:15:01.039
This hat.

00:15:01.063 --> 00:15:05.821
This jacket is my brother, who gave me
some glue when I was seven.

00:15:05.845 --> 00:15:07.210
That's what it represents.

00:15:10.097 --> 00:15:13.943
These shoes that I have on represent
never having gone to school.

00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:17.395
These shoes from Catalino.

00:15:18.094 --> 00:15:19.462
His very painful shoes.

00:15:20.221 --> 00:15:23.062
This shirt that I'm wearing.

00:15:28.525 --> 00:15:33.429
It's about all the times I was beaten up
by friends, by good friends.

00:15:34.565 --> 00:15:39.620
And finally, these pants are my mom,
who worked as a prostitute

00:15:39.644 --> 00:15:40.917
and was never home.

00:15:43.378 --> 00:15:46.422
We are all equal, as you can see.

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:48.663
We may have very small differences.

00:15:48.687 --> 00:15:51.446
But I always try to be thankful
for what I have,

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.527
and not concerned for what I lack.

00:15:55.056 --> 00:15:58.222
(Applause)

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.740
This --

00:16:14.384 --> 00:16:16.915
This underwear --

00:16:18.503 --> 00:16:24.411
represents being born
at Sanatorio Británico,

00:16:24.435 --> 00:16:26.852
with the help of first-rate doctors.

00:16:26.876 --> 00:16:28.990
That's what this underwear represents.

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:38.972
This shirt represents having gone
to a private Marist school,

00:16:38.996 --> 00:16:41.036
from preschool to high school.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.837
Martín Jáuregui: Wait, I'll help you.
Let's keep applauding, don't you think?

00:16:44.861 --> 00:16:49.369
(Applause)

00:16:49.393 --> 00:16:51.022
Pachi Tamer: Ironed by my mom.

00:16:51.046 --> 00:16:53.886
She ironed it last night.
She's here somewhere.

00:17:02.877 --> 00:17:06.102
These pants represent
starting three different majors,

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:09.359
and the parents who supported me
until I found what I liked.

00:17:09.383 --> 00:17:12.433
(Applause)

00:17:24.282 --> 00:17:27.917
And finally these are my shoes,
which I wear every day.

00:17:28.897 --> 00:17:30.987
They represent my mom's sacrifices,

00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:33.551
because at 74 she keeps working,

00:17:33.575 --> 00:17:36.226
so a fucking divorce
doesn't leave me on the streets.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.654
These are my shoes.

00:17:37.678 --> 00:17:40.741
Thank you all for walking
in them for 18 minutes.

00:17:40.765 --> 00:17:42.567
Thank you mom. Thank you all.
