00:00:01.022 --> 00:00:05.412
One day, a palindrome
might just save your life.

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:10.280
Today, there are many methods,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.751
techniques and therapies

00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:14.185
to improve health and productivity,

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:16.867
so it's strange that no one
has yet noticed

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:19.142
the virtues of palindromes.

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:21.056
This is what I'm going to talk about.

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.494
I was about 7 or 8 years old
when my grandmother

00:00:24.494 --> 00:00:26.578
introduced me to palindromes.

00:00:26.578 --> 00:00:30.243
She told me to write the name of this
beautiful Argentine province: [NEUQUEN]

00:00:30.793 --> 00:00:34.620
Then she said the famous sentence:
"Now read it backwards."

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.112
"Dábale arroz a la zorra el abad."
[Give the foxy lady some rice, abbot]

00:00:38.473 --> 00:00:39.871
I couldn't believe it.

00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:41.537
I was filled with wonder.

00:00:41.537 --> 00:00:43.777
I didn't know what an abbot was,

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.959
and I thought "zorra"
just meant "female fox."

00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:47.978
(Laughter)

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:50.038
But I knew that this was magic.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.362
(Laughter)

00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:55.784
It was the magic of a passion
being awoken inside me.

00:00:56.343 --> 00:01:00.339
Since then, I started to read
everything backwards.

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.736
And I realized that we are surrounded
by palindromes,

00:01:05.403 --> 00:01:08.987
which are invisible until you realize
they're right there before your eyes.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:14.349
So, I started to look for the most
ingenious palindromes ever created,

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:16.312
and I came up with beautiful ones like:

00:01:16.312 --> 00:01:18.792
"Amo la pacífica paloma"
[I love the peaceful dove]

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:21.117
"Nos ideó Edison"
[Edison gave us the idea]

00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:24.721
"Yo hago yoga hoy"
[I'm doing yoga today]

00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:25.816
(Laughter)

00:01:25.816 --> 00:01:29.636
"La ruta nos aportó otro paso natural"
[The road gave us another natural step]

00:01:29.712 --> 00:01:33.005
Back then, I thought
that creating palindromes

00:01:33.037 --> 00:01:34.575
was only for total geniuses.

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:36.676
Like the great physicists.

00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:39.512
Or that it's a mystical revelation.

00:01:39.512 --> 00:01:41.918
This is how I explained
perfect palindromes like:

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:43.433
"Eva y Yavé."
[Eve and Yahweh]

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:45.707
Or simply, "Alá." [Allah]

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.740
Later, I realized that anyone
can create palindromes.

00:01:50.497 --> 00:01:54.301
I discovered this in an elevator,
reading one of the buttons,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.773
and saw the poetic: "Luz azul."
[Blue light]

00:01:56.773 --> 00:01:59.316
In a similar vein, in a bar restroom,

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:01.772
I discovered "Soñaba baños."
[I dream of bathroom]

00:02:02.102 --> 00:02:06.227
From then on I started to create
my own palindromes.

00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:08.038
I started with sentences like:

00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:10.896
"Ánimo de mono me domina."
[The monkey's mood dominates me]

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:12.187
(Laughter)

00:02:12.187 --> 00:02:17.540
(Applause)

00:02:18.463 --> 00:02:21.094
Then with short poems.

00:02:21.332 --> 00:02:23.311
More complicated poems.

00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:24.611
Comics.

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.022
I tried out different types,

00:02:26.048 --> 00:02:29.348
until I started writing
a super complicated palindrome,

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.934
which had been my goal
since as long as I can remember,

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:34.617
that was 6,886 words long,

00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:38.446
and took up about 70 pages in total.

00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:42.133
And it was four months of utter madness,

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:46.763
which culminated in a book
that was completely useless

00:02:47.074 --> 00:02:48.423
and not popular at all.

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:49.706
(Laughter)

00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:52.148
But it was what I was searching for.

00:02:52.148 --> 00:02:54.093
And I think it's here

00:02:54.093 --> 00:02:58.164
you find the line
between passion and madness.

00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:02.481
This could be considered
a symptom of neurosis in psychiatry,

00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:04.127
or in economics,

00:03:04.127 --> 00:03:07.846
the investment of useful time
in something completely unproductive.

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:08.846
(Laughter)

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.553
But this is what it took to reach
the goal I was aiming for.

00:03:13.814 --> 00:03:16.484
Whatever that goal is,

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.211
no matter how ridiculous or absurd it is,

00:03:20.211 --> 00:03:24.424
it is where you draw the line
between true passion

00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:26.783
and simple madness.

00:03:27.843 --> 00:03:32.248
And, by the way, palindromes
are a very healthy activity.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.845
So I'm going to tell you
all of its benefits

00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:40.500
and why a palindrome
might just save your life one day.

00:03:41.418 --> 00:03:45.278
But first, we are going on a quick tour
of the history of the palindrome

00:03:45.278 --> 00:03:46.919
to give you a general idea.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.578
One of the first ancestors

00:03:49.578 --> 00:03:53.521
is the Sator Square found
in some Roman ruins in Europe.

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:57.128
It's bidirectional as well as vertical.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.240
This is called the Sator Square,
a type of magic square.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.561
It has been interpreted in many ways:
numerologically, cabalistically,

00:04:03.561 --> 00:04:04.893
even religiously.

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.492
Palindromes have always
been linked to magic.

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:12.288
We find palindromes scattered
throughout the centuries,

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:16.479
like this Latin inscription
in some churches in Europe.

00:04:16.978 --> 00:04:19.908
Or this Greek inscription,
also found in churches in Europe.

00:04:19.908 --> 00:04:22.465
This one, in Latin,
is attributed to Dante Alighieri.

00:04:22.465 --> 00:04:24.551
This one, in Italian, to Michelangelo.

00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:28.725
Palindromes continued to flourish
into the 20th century.

00:04:29.664 --> 00:04:32.273
Some great writers, like James Joyce,
like to indulge.

00:04:32.273 --> 00:04:34.080
This one is in English.

00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:37.497
And, in Spanish, here's one
by the Argentinian Juan Filloy.

00:04:37.497 --> 00:04:41.473
One of the first collectors and theorists
of the palindrome.

00:04:42.604 --> 00:04:44.425
The Mexican, Augusto Monterroso,

00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:48.191
has a chapter called "Onis es asesino,"
Onis is murdered, in one of his books.

00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:49.955
Our esteemed Julio Cortázar,

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:52.703
wove four palindromes
into in his short story "Lejana,"

00:04:52.703 --> 00:04:55.033
and he made them famous.

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:58.285
The Darío Lancini's book
"Oír a Darío," Listen to Darío,

00:04:58.285 --> 00:05:01.922
starts with some palindrome poems.

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:04.757
And this brings us
to the end of the 20th century,

00:05:04.757 --> 00:05:06.980
with the International
Palindromist Club (IPC)

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.337
where a group of slightly
eccentric intellectuals

00:05:09.337 --> 00:05:12.517
got together to share palindromes.

00:05:12.767 --> 00:05:17.239
In 1987 they started
a magazine about palindromes

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.117
that continues to this day.

00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:24.652
As you can imagine, I was over the moon
when I met this group.

00:05:24.652 --> 00:05:29.530
It was the first time I could share
this eccentric passion of mine.

00:05:30.617 --> 00:05:33.634
And it proved that I wasn't
completely insane.

00:05:34.454 --> 00:05:37.561
Now begins, as my friend
Pedro Ruiz likes to call it,

00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:39.686
the Golden Age of palindromes.

00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:42.805
Because, even though people
don't know what the word means,

00:05:42.805 --> 00:05:45.036
there are thousands
of palindromes in the world

00:05:45.036 --> 00:05:46.300
of all shapes and sizes.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.244
Palindromists abound all over the world,

00:05:48.244 --> 00:05:51.274
and they have initiated
a wave of publications

00:05:51.274 --> 00:05:55.145
that aim to better classify the art.

00:05:57.365 --> 00:06:03.225
And with this in mind, in 2009 we started
the palindromic literary movement

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:04.901
REVER
[To see again]

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.760
Our objective is to elevate the palindrome

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.166
from a simple game
to a form of literature.

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:14.675
A true literary composition.

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:18.798
And thus, in 2013
the palindrome came to TEDx,

00:06:18.994 --> 00:06:20.929
and I want to show you

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:24.308
that a palindrome truly is a literary
composition and not just a game,

00:06:24.346 --> 00:06:27.801
and it should be considered
a method of mental training.

00:06:27.827 --> 00:06:31.211
So I'm going to tell you 10 benefits

00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:33.857
for our mental health.

00:06:33.857 --> 00:06:35.341
And finally, I will tell you

00:06:35.341 --> 00:06:39.328
why a palindrome can save
your life one day.

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:44.021
The palindromic experience is very unique.

00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:47.654
It's a mixture of making crosswords
and writing poetry.

00:06:47.654 --> 00:06:50.089
A game and a search for sense.

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:55.064
The palindrome is an active work,
because it's about creating palindromes.

00:06:55.064 --> 00:06:58.678
While you write one on one side,
the palindrome writes itself on the other.

00:06:58.678 --> 00:07:03.710
This gives interesting and unique
benefits to out intellectual health.

00:07:04.765 --> 00:07:08.516
It is a holistic exercise for the brain.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.117
That is the first of its benefits.

00:07:12.133 --> 00:07:14.760
Once, in a presentation,
a teacher told me

00:07:14.786 --> 00:07:16.235
that palindromes interest her

00:07:16.261 --> 00:07:18.515
because she works with people
with Alzheimer's.

00:07:18.515 --> 00:07:21.619
Like all inventive games,
it's an exercise of logic for the brain.

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:24.166
But palindromes go even further,

00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:28.176
because symmetry exercises
the left hemisphere of the brain,

00:07:28.176 --> 00:07:30.019
but searching for meaning

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:32.396
exercises the intuition
from the right hemisphere.

00:07:32.396 --> 00:07:35.519
So it's a holistic experience
in a single exercise.

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:38.168
It stimulates surprise and creativity.

00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:40.814
We never know how a palindrome
is going to turn out.

00:07:40.814 --> 00:07:44.596
And this connects us
with the creativity we have inside.

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:46.462
It's a game and it's fun.

00:07:46.462 --> 00:07:48.692
Because it's a game that we play seriously

00:07:48.692 --> 00:07:52.830
and we understand that we can always
make a game out of life.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.356
And it always makes us smile
even though it's not funny.

00:07:57.106 --> 00:08:00.445
Palindromes reveal the importance
of the insignificant.

00:08:00.445 --> 00:08:02.854
Because each letter
in a palindrome is fundamental,

00:08:02.854 --> 00:08:06.471
it teaches us the value of small things.

00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:09.363
It promotes a change of focus,

00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:11.974
when we start to write a palindrome,

00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:14.897
and something completely different
appears on the other side.

00:08:14.897 --> 00:08:17.107
If you write Amor [Love],
Roma [Rome] appears.

00:08:17.107 --> 00:08:19.589
So a focus on love
turns into something historical.

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:24.703
And so we inevitably have to change focus
and look for alternative solutions.

00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:27.886
It awakens dormant skills in us.

00:08:28.332 --> 00:08:30.729
It requires us to think
about the complicated

00:08:30.729 --> 00:08:35.057
and sometimes wakes up skills
that we didn't even know we possessed.

00:08:36.402 --> 00:08:39.299
It makes us look for balance.

00:08:39.523 --> 00:08:44.162
Because a palindrome is basically about
balancing the meaning of the two extremes.

00:08:44.162 --> 00:08:47.216
And this, instantly,
can be applied to life.

00:08:47.596 --> 00:08:49.934
It acquaints us with failure.

00:08:49.934 --> 00:08:53.664
Because out of the 100 palindromes
that we start,

00:08:53.664 --> 00:08:57.176
only one will probably
have a satisfactory ending.

00:08:57.176 --> 00:09:00.133
This sense of failure stops being a ghost

00:09:00.133 --> 00:09:04.815
and becomes an inevitable step
on the path to success.

00:09:06.152 --> 00:09:10.045
It exercises flexibility and adaptation
when searching for objectives.

00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:13.099
Because it teaches us
when to adapt to a situation,

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:15.313
as the rules are very strict,

00:09:15.313 --> 00:09:18.782
and when to really fight
to create that palindrome.

00:09:18.782 --> 00:09:20.945
Without this conviction,
we'd end up saying:

00:09:20.945 --> 00:09:23.514
making palindromes is impossible!

00:09:23.514 --> 00:09:25.021
But it actually isn't.

00:09:25.541 --> 00:09:29.748
And finally, palindromes
speak to our existential doubts.

00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:32.997
As I said earlier, palindromes
always surprise you.

00:09:32.997 --> 00:09:36.700
They have an air of magic about them.

00:09:37.004 --> 00:09:38.879
In this sense,

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:43.660
we can use them as a way
to ask about doubts in our lives.

00:09:44.196 --> 00:09:48.367
For example, when my friend Christian
asked me to come here,

00:09:48.416 --> 00:09:51.302
it was a little complicated,
so I resorted to palindromancy.

00:09:51.302 --> 00:09:54.426
And I came up with: "Acude y educa"
[Attend and educate]

00:09:54.426 --> 00:09:56.778
(Laughter)

00:09:56.778 --> 00:10:01.427
(Applause)

00:10:01.427 --> 00:10:03.424
I could only reply:

00:10:03.424 --> 00:10:04.588
"¡Yo voy!"
[I'm coming!]

00:10:04.588 --> 00:10:06.077
(Laughter)

00:10:06.077 --> 00:10:08.798
But anyway, to conclude,

00:10:10.204 --> 00:10:13.597
palindromes can make us
think about the meaning of life.

00:10:13.597 --> 00:10:16.853
And this is actually
a question about being.

00:10:17.514 --> 00:10:21.831
The search for your own passion
is riddled with doubts and obstacles.

00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:24.076
Do we have to be what we're told to be?

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:26.655
Normal, productive, conforming people?

00:10:26.655 --> 00:10:29.238
Or be who we really are?

00:10:29.238 --> 00:10:33.071
In this matter,
the palindrome is inflexible.

00:10:33.673 --> 00:10:36.202
And the answers are blunt:

00:10:36.977 --> 00:10:39.205
"Se es o no se es."
[It is or it isn't]

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:41.302
(Laughter)

00:10:41.302 --> 00:10:43.812
"Somos o no somos."
[We are or we aren't]

00:10:43.816 --> 00:10:46.716
And if you are left with any doubt,
repeat to yourself:

00:10:46.716 --> 00:10:48.825
"Sos o no sos."
[You are or you aren't]

00:10:48.825 --> 00:10:50.897
(Laughter)

00:10:50.897 --> 00:10:55.322
So we can see that palindromes
teach us that there's no escape.

00:10:55.598 --> 00:10:58.139
We have to think about who we are,

00:10:58.139 --> 00:10:59.433
to confront our passion,

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:02.623
no matter how absurd or strange it is.

00:11:03.693 --> 00:11:07.711
And, to stop and say to the world,
with conviction:

00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:09.491
"Yo soy."
[I am]

00:11:09.881 --> 00:11:12.097
I am what I'm looking for,
I am what I choose,

00:11:12.097 --> 00:11:13.227
I am what I want.

00:11:13.227 --> 00:11:15.224
Simply, I am.

00:11:16.503 --> 00:11:17.996
(Applause)

00:11:20.606 --> 00:11:24.305
In conclusion, I have to say
that I haven't forgotten

00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:28.143
I need to tell you how a palindrome might
save your life one day!

00:11:28.143 --> 00:11:33.480
Imagine you're lost in a remote desert
or a desert island.

00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:37.182
A palindrome can save your life!
[S.O.S.]

00:11:37.182 --> 00:11:38.668
(Applause)
