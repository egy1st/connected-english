00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.303
The first question I asked myself

00:00:06.327 --> 00:00:08.615
and I'll ask you too is this:

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:10.945
What is poverty?

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:17.426
Maybe some of you imagine
that poverty has to do with this,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.935
In fact, since I was a kid I believed --

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:24.117
or I should say I was told
that poverty was linked to this.

00:00:24.427 --> 00:00:26.934
I am the fifth of six children:

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:31.680
Yomi, Mariela, Marcela,
Mauricio, me, and Oscar.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.216
We were born in San Juan.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.682
We came to Buenos Aires
for the moon and the stars.

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:42.726
My father had been promised
a job, a home, a car, success.

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:47.185
This is the only picture
I have of my parents together.

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:51.068
Because Buenos Aires killed my father.

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:54.039
He ended up dying
within a few years of being here.

00:00:54.063 --> 00:00:57.226
And there it began an eternal struggle

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.830
to live with dignity

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:04.670
and to improve our quality of life.

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:09.852
We seized a plot with my brothers.

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:11.425
We were poor,

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:17.234
people who were living in an usurped land.

00:01:17.835 --> 00:01:20.633
We sometimes even didn't have
anything to eat for dinner.

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:23.536
However, despite all this,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.815
despite having lived
through discrimination,

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:32.930
and my whole family
being pointed out for many years,

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:38.417
there was something
I always loved and I always liked.

00:01:39.447 --> 00:01:42.763
I love music, I'm a musician.

00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:49.814
And I really discovered music
through a woman,

00:01:49.838 --> 00:01:51.838
who, when I listened to her,

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.617
would always amaze me.

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:59.443
I would look at her and see her like...

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:00.633
an angel.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.120
I knew all her songs, all her lyrics,
all her choreographies.

00:02:06.144 --> 00:02:09.382
I learned all her songs,
I had all her tapes.

00:02:09.406 --> 00:02:11.374
Back then we still had tapes.

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:14.763
And for me she was a star, an angel.

00:02:16.227 --> 00:02:18.727
This woman was Gladys, la Bomba Tucumana.

00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:20.555
(Laughter)

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.434
(Applause)

00:02:24.307 --> 00:02:25.539
I dreamed with Gladys.

00:02:25.563 --> 00:02:28.564
Once I told my mom,
"Mom, I want to be Gladys."

00:02:28.588 --> 00:02:30.219
(Laughter)

00:02:30.243 --> 00:02:35.485
And she said, "Oh son, don't you like
Antonio Ríos or Alcides?"

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.318
No, I wanted to be Gladys.

00:02:37.342 --> 00:02:40.966
And my mom told me,
"Well, but how about La Nueva Luna?"

00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:45.543
No, I dreamed of being
an artist like her one day.

00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:50.060
I always dreamed of learning
to play her songs.

00:02:50.084 --> 00:02:54.019
A great friend from childhood, Edgardo,

00:02:54.043 --> 00:02:57.787
his mother, Olga worked
in the neighborhood developing projects

00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:03.119
so that people like me, who lived
in these neighborhoods could study.

00:03:03.143 --> 00:03:06.161
They had a project
in Crear Vale La Pena Foundation,

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.981
in which they worked with art
in the context of poverty.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:10.614
My friend told me one day,

00:03:10.638 --> 00:03:13.724
"Daniel, why don't you stop
pestering around with music

00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:16.291
and sign up at the
community center for culture,

00:03:16.315 --> 00:03:19.914
where they give free
keyboard and piano lessons."

00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:23.611
I said, "No, me taking piano lessons?"

00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:29.417
That would be ridiculous to go out there
and give a meaning to my life.

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.521
But he said to me, "You should go
sign up for the piano class."

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.847
And I signed up for piano lessons.

00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:36.769
Saturdays at 9 am.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:40.156
I said, "Oh, how nice!"

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.680
There was a teacher, a concert pianist,
at this organization --

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:47.319
Liliana Alpern --

00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:53.338
who would give a few of hours
of free lessons per week

00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:56.163
to people who could not afford
to pay for classes.

00:03:56.755 --> 00:03:59.662
I started going to her piano class
when I was nine.

00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:04.239
And I saw Lili, my piano teacher,
in high heels, with a silk shawl,

00:04:04.263 --> 00:04:07.189
glasses, green eyes, blond hair.

00:04:08.273 --> 00:04:10.471
And I looked at her and she looked at me.

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:12.093
She said, "What is your name?"

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:14.901
"Daniel." "What are you doing here?"

00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:18.254
There was an upright piano beside her.

00:04:18.278 --> 00:04:19.889
I said, "I want to play that."

00:04:19.913 --> 00:04:22.244
And she says, "What do you want to play?"

00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:25.798
(Laughter)

00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:27.757
And I said, "Gladys, la Bomba Tucumana."

00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:29.648
(Laughter)

00:04:29.672 --> 00:04:32.955
And she said, "Who is that woman?"

00:04:34.026 --> 00:04:36.027
(Laughter)

00:04:36.051 --> 00:04:37.829
"Wait, aren't you a music teacher?"

00:04:37.853 --> 00:04:43.527
"Yes, I certainly am,
but I don't know all the musicians.

00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:48.705
But if you bring a tape with her music,
I'll listen to it and I teach you."

00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:50.961
"Really?" I asked. "Yes."

00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:56.196
So I went back to my house, got the tape,
brought it back, and Lili went:

00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:02.787
"B B B B B, C D, C D E, E F G, B C".

00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:05.057
(Laughter)

00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:07.659
And I said: "Wow!"

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.630
She began to teach me and I felt
I was John Lennon playing "Imagine."

00:05:13.654 --> 00:05:15.768
(Laughter)

00:05:15.792 --> 00:05:17.484
It was awesome.

00:05:17.508 --> 00:05:20.508
(Applause)

00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:34.652
Lili said, "Look Daniel, you can
learn this and much more if you want to."

00:05:35.542 --> 00:05:36.931
"Really, Miss?"

00:05:36.955 --> 00:05:40.630
"Yes. You can learn
everything you want to learn."

00:05:40.654 --> 00:05:45.288
And the next Saturday I brought
La Nueva Luna, Los Charros, Gilda.

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:49.629
I learned to play a band
called Los Palmeras --

00:05:49.653 --> 00:05:51.122
I would dream of them.

00:05:51.146 --> 00:05:54.462
And she taught me all the music
I wanted to learn.

00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:57.442
Pretty soon, I learned
everything I wanted.

00:05:57.466 --> 00:06:00.082
And Lili said, "And now,
what do you want to learn?"

00:06:00.106 --> 00:06:03.629
I said, "That's it, I've learned
to play what I wanted to learn."

00:06:03.653 --> 00:06:07.566
"Daniel, these same chords were used
by a guy named Beethoven.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.294
Do you know who Beethoven is?"

00:06:09.318 --> 00:06:11.142
I told her, "Yes, a dog from a movie."

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:12.856
(Laughter)

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.149
"No, dear, Beethoven is not a dog.

00:06:16.173 --> 00:06:19.388
Beethoven is a musician
who played Für Elise"

00:06:19.716 --> 00:06:21.173
She played the song,

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:24.947
and I fell in love when I heard it.

00:06:25.567 --> 00:06:27.463
I asked her: "Lili, can I play that?"

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:30.765
And Lili said, "You can play that
and much more, Daniel --

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.257
anything you want to play."

00:06:33.281 --> 00:06:38.276
So there, at age of nine, I learned
to break the first level of poverty:

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.893
Cultural poverty.

00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:42.514
I just thought that music was --

00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:45.499
(Applause)

00:06:52.186 --> 00:06:55.565
I thought music was
what I would hear in my neighborhood,

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:59.448
but didn't know that there were
other types of music that existed.

00:06:59.472 --> 00:07:04.561
So I learned to be not only
a musician, but at age 14,

00:07:04.585 --> 00:07:06.478
Lili gave me another challenge --

00:07:06.502 --> 00:07:10.506
me and a fellow piano student,
Marcela Tula --

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.273
both of us attended her class.

00:07:12.297 --> 00:07:16.420
"After five years of taking
free classes at the cultural center,

00:07:16.444 --> 00:07:18.900
you two now should start teaching others."

00:07:18.924 --> 00:07:21.760
And I said, "No, Lili. Me?
I can't teach others."

00:07:21.784 --> 00:07:23.780
"Yes, you can."

00:07:23.804 --> 00:07:25.730
"But Lili, I have nothing to give."

00:07:25.754 --> 00:07:29.059
She said, "To give, you don't need
to have something in your pocket.

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:32.490
All you have to do
is to be willing to help others."

00:07:32.514 --> 00:07:34.660
So I started teaching in my neighborhood.

00:07:34.684 --> 00:07:37.322
Together with Marcela,
we both learned how to teach.

00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:41.888
We gave classes to young people,
the very beginners in the neighborhood.

00:07:41.912 --> 00:07:43.213
I went from being the kid,

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:45.820
who used to hang out
in the street looking for trouble,

00:07:45.844 --> 00:07:47.527
to being the neighborhood teacher.

00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:50.332
Passing by, people would call:
"Professor, Professor!"

00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:52.762
So I'd pass by like four times.

00:07:52.786 --> 00:07:54.838
I'd go to the grocer's and they would say,

00:07:54.862 --> 00:07:59.012
"How are you, professor? Have a candy."
And I'd grab about five.

00:07:59.036 --> 00:08:01.892
The grocer's daughter
was one of my students.

00:08:01.916 --> 00:08:05.072
And there I learned to knock down
another level of poverty,

00:08:05.096 --> 00:08:07.675
which is the poverty of dignity --

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:12.887
a type of poverty that often gets lost
because living in the context we lived in,

00:08:14.122 --> 00:08:19.114
we tend to think that poverty
is only linked to hunger,

00:08:19.138 --> 00:08:21.740
and feeling cold at night -- but no.

00:08:21.764 --> 00:08:24.300
Poverty has little to do with economics.

00:08:24.324 --> 00:08:28.708
It has to do with what you do
to design your life project.

00:08:29.554 --> 00:08:35.292
What you do to say who you are,
regardless of the degree,

00:08:35.956 --> 00:08:38.221
or the position you have in a company.

00:08:38.245 --> 00:08:40.926
Who you are as a person.

00:08:42.087 --> 00:08:46.520
That is what I learned at the age of 14,
to start teaching in my neighborhood.

00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:48.693
When I was 17 --

00:08:48.717 --> 00:08:51.664
(Applause)

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:55.085
At 17, I began to coordinate
the community cultural center

00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:57.126
with activities for young people.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.411
It wasn't just learning
and teaching anymore.

00:09:00.435 --> 00:09:04.713
What we did was to help shape
this young group of people

00:09:04.737 --> 00:09:06.856
to start thinking about our community,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.543
the activities people in the neighborhood
can do to improve their quality of life,

00:09:11.567 --> 00:09:15.455
not only of those who studied,
but our whole community.

00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:19.455
We organized events in neighborhoods,
we celebrated Children's Day,

00:09:19.479 --> 00:09:21.705
looking for the needs in our neighborhoods

00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:24.175
and we began to improve
not only our lives,

00:09:24.199 --> 00:09:26.180
but the lives of our neighbors.

00:09:26.204 --> 00:09:28.545
I left the foundation when I was 25,

00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:31.720
because I felt that it enabled me
to go from being a student

00:09:31.744 --> 00:09:34.845
to becoming a teacher,
coordinator, executive director,

00:09:34.869 --> 00:09:38.097
I even prepped young people
in political issues.

00:09:38.932 --> 00:09:43.018
And I began to understand
that I had to knock down another poverty.

00:09:43.042 --> 00:09:46.352
So I started working with a civil
organization called Inicia.

00:09:46.376 --> 00:09:50.106
What we did at Inicia
was to work in a prison,

00:09:51.033 --> 00:09:54.169
because the son of a friend of mine
was there in the unit

00:09:54.193 --> 00:09:56.748
and we went to visit him.

00:09:57.949 --> 00:10:00.485
When I went to the prison
the first thing I saw

00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:03.189
were those drawings that you see
behind the young men,

00:10:03.213 --> 00:10:05.410
it was like an art gallery.

00:10:05.434 --> 00:10:10.363
They were drawings where they had drawn
everything they wanted.

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:14.071
I looked at Cristian with Olga
and we said, "Hey, Cristian,

00:10:14.095 --> 00:10:15.761
what do you do here in this unit?"

00:10:15.785 --> 00:10:17.089
"Nothing".

00:10:17.113 --> 00:10:18.275
"What do you mean?"

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:22.317
"Nothing. Nothing on Monday,
nothing on Tuesday, nothing on Thursday."

00:10:22.341 --> 00:10:25.577
"What if I proposed to do a workshop

00:10:25.601 --> 00:10:29.117
where you can think about
the mistake you made, why you are here

00:10:29.141 --> 00:10:32.511
and you can think of a project
for when you leave prison?"

00:10:32.535 --> 00:10:35.111
And Cristian replied,
"Would you do that for me?"

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.361
"Of course."

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:39.392
Then we started a workshop
where we talked about leadership,

00:10:39.416 --> 00:10:41.814
so they could lead their life project.

00:10:41.838 --> 00:10:44.356
We had a book, "The New Leaders,"

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.098
which belonged to this organization.

00:10:46.122 --> 00:10:49.044
And it had chapters like:
"Personal transformation,"

00:10:49.068 --> 00:10:51.530
"The common good", "Ethics" or "Values."

00:10:51.554 --> 00:10:56.902
We read each chapter with the inmates,
the 48 who attended the workshop.

00:10:56.926 --> 00:10:59.562
And not only that, we created a comic book

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:03.102
and each of them put what they learned
from the chapters in the comic book.

00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:06.279
That's when I knocked down
another poverty -- that of prejudice.

00:11:08.673 --> 00:11:11.499
We think that people
who are deprived of their liberty

00:11:11.523 --> 00:11:13.279
not only deserve to be there,

00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:16.025
but they don't have the ability,
nor the dignity

00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:17.719
to be able to change their future.

00:11:17.743 --> 00:11:20.029
Well, they actually can
change their future.

00:11:20.053 --> 00:11:22.859
All they need are opportunities.

00:11:23.513 --> 00:11:26.979
And what I was providing there
was an opportunity.

00:11:27.427 --> 00:11:31.317
But it's not only with this that I
knocked down the poverty of prejudice.

00:11:32.135 --> 00:11:35.674
I got to work on another project

00:11:36.013 --> 00:11:40.273
with a colleague, an acquaintance
from the gastronomic industry,

00:11:40.297 --> 00:11:43.026
who had a restaurant chain
in down San Isidro.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.798
He said, "Dani, in front of my restaurants

00:11:45.822 --> 00:11:48.914
is the settlement Martin and Omar
and I don't know what to do,

00:11:48.938 --> 00:11:50.980
because every time I pass by they ask me,

00:11:51.004 --> 00:11:53.096
'Hey, mustache, got work for me?',

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.917
and I don't know what to do".

00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:57.926
Then we created a program
called Cocina para Integrar.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.036
What we did?

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.682
This man would teach the women
from the settlement to become chefs,

00:12:05.214 --> 00:12:10.308
so that they are trained
not only to do any given job,

00:12:10.332 --> 00:12:12.972
but also in a trade,
in the gastronomic industry.

00:12:12.996 --> 00:12:16.733
And then I broke another type
of prejudice, another type of poverty.

00:12:16.757 --> 00:12:19.774
The poverty of thinking
that people who are living

00:12:19.798 --> 00:12:22.711
in a context of vulnerability
can only work doing odd jobs.

00:12:22.735 --> 00:12:26.511
No, they are professionals
who also can be formed in trades,

00:12:26.903 --> 00:12:29.547
as that of being a chef.

00:12:29.571 --> 00:12:32.691
On this path I met with another person

00:12:32.715 --> 00:12:35.809
who also helped me knock down
another one of my poverties.

00:12:35.833 --> 00:12:38.569
We met during a talk we gave together.

00:12:39.643 --> 00:12:43.954
He had a company which developed
products with design,

00:12:43.978 --> 00:12:45.815
shoes with a different design.

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:50.249
He gave his talk, about a young company
that exported worldwide.

00:12:50.273 --> 00:12:54.404
After I gave my talk he said to me,
"Dani, you have to work with me."

00:12:54.428 --> 00:12:57.989
And I said, "Tomás, what do you want me
to work on in your business?"

00:12:58.013 --> 00:13:01.702
"Do the same things in my company
that you did in the neighborhoods.

00:13:01.726 --> 00:13:05.269
You'll be working in my neighborhood,
which is my business, my community,

00:13:05.293 --> 00:13:06.665
with my employees."

00:13:06.689 --> 00:13:08.295
"What do you want me to do?"

00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:10.659
"I want you to be the HR manager."

00:13:10.683 --> 00:13:13.905
And I said, "But, Tomás,
I don't even know how to clear salaries."

00:13:13.929 --> 00:13:16.059
He says, "I don't care,
you will learn that,

00:13:16.083 --> 00:13:19.360
what you know is to listen
and to be with the people."

00:13:19.384 --> 00:13:23.130
After working three years with him,
he proposes me to be even more than that.

00:13:23.753 --> 00:13:26.719
And today I'm the manager
of Culture and Happiness.

00:13:26.743 --> 00:13:29.120
In the private sector I work as --

00:13:29.144 --> 00:13:31.993
(Applause)

00:13:39.004 --> 00:13:43.456
I not only work in the neighborhoods

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.586
to improve people's quality of life --

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.696
but also companies start
to think that all the people

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.686
working in a company can improve
their quality of life.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.810
They have to work being happy
and as part of the company culture.

00:13:56.165 --> 00:13:59.215
(Applause)

00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:03.120
You may ask me today, what is your wealth?

00:14:03.144 --> 00:14:07.552
My wealth has to do with this:
to have formed a family,

00:14:07.576 --> 00:14:10.790
with my wife, with my brothers,
with my friends.

00:14:12.032 --> 00:14:15.449
To be the parent of Lautaro and Catalina,
who is two months old.

00:14:16.384 --> 00:14:20.833
And I want to tell you this:
any of you here

00:14:22.405 --> 00:14:24.834
can be a Liliana Alpern.

00:14:24.858 --> 00:14:30.144
Anyone of you can give their time
once a week to someone else,

00:14:30.168 --> 00:14:32.182
so that they change their lives.

00:14:32.206 --> 00:14:34.281
(Applause)

00:14:44.306 --> 00:14:49.338
Regardless of your economic poverty
or your economic wealth,

00:14:49.673 --> 00:14:53.593
don't make your life a poor life.

00:14:53.617 --> 00:14:55.148
Thank you very much.

00:14:55.172 --> 00:14:58.126
(Applause)
