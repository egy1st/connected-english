WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You know, I've talked about some of these projects before --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
about the human genome and what that might mean,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and discovering new sets of genes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're actually starting at a new point:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we've been digitizing biology,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and now we're trying to go from that digital code

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
into a new phase of biology

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with designing and synthesizing life.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, we've always been trying to ask big questions.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
"What is life?" is something that I think many biologists

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
have been trying to understand

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
at various levels.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We've tried various approaches,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
paring it down to minimal components.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years;

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
when we sequenced the human genome,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it was going from the analog world of biology

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
into the digital world of the computer.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or can we create new life

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
out of this digital universe?"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is the map of a small organism,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Mycoplasma genitalium,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that has the smallest genome for a species

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that can self-replicate in the laboratory,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and we've been trying to just see if

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we can come up with an even smaller genome.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
out of the 500 or so that are here.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
When we look at its metabolic map,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
it's relatively simple

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
compared to ours --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
trust me, this is simple --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but when we look at all the genes

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that we can knock out one at a time,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
it's very unlikely that this would yield

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a living cell.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So we decided the only way forward

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
was to actually synthesize this chromosome

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so we could vary the components

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to ask some of these most fundamental questions.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And so we started down the road of:

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
can we synthesize a chromosome?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Can chemistry permit making

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
these really large molecules

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
where we've never been before?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
at an exponential pace.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Our ability to write the genetic code

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
has been moving pretty slowly

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but has been increasing,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We started this over 15 years ago.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It took several stages, in fact,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But it turns out synthesizing DNA

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
is very difficult.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that make small pieces of DNA --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
30 to 50 letters in length --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the more errors there are.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So we had to create a new method

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
of the genome of phi X174.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It's a small virus that kills bacteria.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We designed the pieces, went through our error correction

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and had a DNA molecule

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
of about 5,000 letters.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and put it in the bacteria,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and the bacteria started to read this genetic code,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
made the viral particles.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The viral particles then were released from the cells

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and came back and killed the E. coli.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I was talking to the oil industry recently

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and I said they clearly understood that model.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
(Laughter)

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
They laughed more than you guys are. (Laughter)

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And so, we think this is a situation

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
where the software can actually build its own hardware

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
in a biological system.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But we wanted to go much larger:

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code --

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
so we could actually vary the cassettes

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to understand

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
what the actual components of a living cell are.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Design is critical,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and if you're starting with digital information in the computer,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that digital information has to be really accurate.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
When we first sequenced this genome in 1995,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We actually found, on resequencing it,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
30 errors; had we used that original sequence,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
it never would have been able to be booted up.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Part of the design is designing pieces

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that are 50 letters long

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to build smaller subunits

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
we have to design so they can go together.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We design unique elements into this.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
You may have read that we put watermarks in.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Think of this:

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
we have a four-letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Triplets of those letters

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
code for roughly 20 amino acids,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
such that there's a single letter designation

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
for each of the amino acids.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So we can use the genetic code to write out words,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
sentences, thoughts.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Initially, all we did was autograph it.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Some people were disappointed there was not poetry.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We designed these pieces so

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
we can just chew back with enzymes;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
there are enzymes that repair them and put them together.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And we started making pieces,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
then put sets of those going up to 72,000.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
so we could sequence them

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
that you can see in a minute.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
We're trying to get to the point of automation.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So, this looks like a basketball playoff.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
When we get into these really large pieces

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
over 100,000 base pairs,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology --

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and so we turned to other mechanisms.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that biology uses to repair DNA

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
that can put pieces together.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Here's an example of it:

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
there's an organism called

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Deinococcus radiodurans

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that can take three millions rads of radiation.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Twelve to 24 hours later, it put it

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
back together exactly as it was before.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
These organisms can be totally desiccated;

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
they can live in a vacuum.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
move around, find a new aqueous environment.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
using these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
with the right design of the pieces we put them in;

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
yeast puts them together automatically.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
This is not an electron micrograph;

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
this is just a regular photomicrograph.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It's such a large molecule

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
we can see it with a light microscope.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
These are pictures over about a six-second period.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code;

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
It's over 300 million molecular weight.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
it takes 142 pages

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
just to print this genetic code.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple;

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
It's also simpler when you go

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
into eukaryotes like ourselves:

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
you can just pop out the nucleus

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and pop in another one,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and that's what you've all heard about with cloning.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
of a chromosome from one cell to another

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and activate it.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
We purified a chromosome from one microbial species --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice --

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
we added a few extra genes

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
so we could select for this chromosome,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
we digested it with enzymes

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to kill all the proteins,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and you'll appreciate

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
our very sophisticated graphics here.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
The new chromosome went into the cell.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but we tried to design the process a little bit further.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
We find all kinds of species

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that have taken up a second chromosome

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
or a third one from somewhere,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
adding thousands of new traits

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
in a second to that species.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So, people who think of evolution

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
as just one gene changing at a time

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
have missed much of biology.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
There are enzymes called restriction enzymes

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that actually digest DNA.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
The chromosome that was in the cell

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
doesn't have one;

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the chromosome we put in does.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
It got expressed and it recognized

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the other chromosome as foreign material,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
chewed it up, and so we ended up

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
just with a cell with the new chromosome.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And with a very short period of time,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
all the characteristics of one species were lost

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and it converted totally into the new species

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
based on the new software that we put in the cell.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
All the proteins changed,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the membranes changed;

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So, this may sound like genomic alchemy,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
but we can, by moving the software of DNA around,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
change things quite dramatically.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Now I've argued, this is not genesis;

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And I've argued that we're about to perhaps

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
create a new version of the Cambrian explosion,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
where there's massive new speciation

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
based on this digital design.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Why do this?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
We're about to go from six and a half

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
to nine billion people over the next 40 years.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
To put it in context for myself:

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I was born in 1946.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
There are now three people on the planet

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
for every one of us that existed in 1946;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
within 40 years, there'll be four.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
We have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
medicines, fuel

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
for the six and a half billion.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We use over five billion tons of coal,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
30 billion-plus barrels of oil --

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
that's a hundred million barrels a day.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
When we try to think of biological processes

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
or any process to replace that,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
it's going to be a huge challenge.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Then of course, there's all that

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
CO2 from this material

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that ends up in the atmosphere.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
We now, from our discovery around the world,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
have a database with about 20 million genes,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and I like to think of these as the design components of the future.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and look at the diversity that came out of that.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We're limited here primarily

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
by a biological reality

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and our imagination.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
We now have techniques,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
because of these rapid methods of synthesis,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
We have the ability now to build a large robot

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
that can make a million chromosomes a day.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
When you think of processing these 20 million different genes

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
or trying to optimize processes

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
new vaccines,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
we can just with a small team,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
do more molecular biology

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
than the last 20 years of all science.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And it's just standard selection:

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
we can select for viability,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
chemical or fuel production,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
vaccine production, etc.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
This is a screen snapshot

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
of some true design software

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
that we're working on to actually be able to sit down

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and design species in the computer.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like:

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
we know exactly what their genetic code looks like.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
We're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
You've seen recently, corn to ethanol

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
is just a bad experiment.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
We have second- and third-generation fuels

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that will be coming out relatively soon

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that are sugar, to much higher-value fuels

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
like octane or different types of butanol.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
But the only way we think that biology

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
can have a major impact without

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
in about 18 months.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Sunlight and CO2 is one method ...

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
(Applause)

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
but in our discovery around the world,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
we have all kinds of other methods.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
This is an organism we described in 1996.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
It lives in the deep ocean,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
about a mile and a half deep,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
almost at boiling-water temperatures.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It takes CO2 to methane

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
using molecular hydrogen as its energy source.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
We're looking to see if we can take

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
captured CO2,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
which can easily be piped to sites,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
convert that CO2 back into fuel

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
to drive this process.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So, in a short period of time,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
we think that we might be able to increase

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
what the basic question is of "What is life?"

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
We truly, you know,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
have modest goals

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? --

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
(Laughter)

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
become a major source of energy ...

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
But also, we're now working on using these same tools

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
to come up with instant sets of vaccines.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
You've seen this year with flu;

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
we're always a year behind and a dollar short

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
when it comes to the right vaccine.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
I think that can be changed

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
by building combinatorial vaccines in advance.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Here's what the future may begin to look like

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
with changing, now, the evolutionary tree,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
speeding up evolution

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
with synthetic bacteria, Archaea

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and, eventually, eukaryotes.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
We're a ways away from improving people:

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000
(Applause)
