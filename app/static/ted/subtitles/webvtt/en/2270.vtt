00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:04.557
It's time to innovate

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.110
where no one is innovating:

00:00:08.603 --> 00:00:10.376
in the political system.

00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:14.966
Because our democracy
is terribly stalemated

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.376
and is no longer able to answer
the demands of a society

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.046
that is becoming more and more complex

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.790
and is being transformed
by new technologies.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.996
Working in politics is not easy.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.353
In fact, I gave my first steps
in the world of civil society.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.454
But I think we need
a better distribution of power,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.752
to share knowledge
and create spaces for dialogue

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.260
so that we can produce
better solutions with more consensus.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.110
Politics is the best tool
that we have to do it.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.746
So, a couple of years ago,
I decided to take a leap of faith;

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.150
I began working on a political campaign
in the province of Buenos Aires.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.591
And I didn't like at all what I saw.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.366
First of all, no one was discussing ideas.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.246
They were only discussing people.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.216
I remember that on one occasion

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.806
I saw how they used Photoshop
to erase a mustache and whiten the teeth

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.476
of a candidate
because he had to look younger.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.306
It didn't matter if his ideas
were from the past century.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.401
Pretending was all that mattered.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.476
I was in a city warehouse once,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.256
in Greater Buenos Aires,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.156
and it was fully stocked with sheets,
mattresses, and building materials

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.827
they had never delivered.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.916
When I asked what the materials
were doing there,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.986
and why they didn't deliver them,
they answered me lightly:

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.236
"Don't you realize? We're storing them
for next year, for the elections."

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.482
Of course.
That year there were no elections.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.766
People weren't voting; did it matter

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.776
they had no roof over their heads
or a place to sleep?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.966
That year they weren't being consulted.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.736
And that's the problem.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.768
We live in a political system
that responds

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.192
to a 400-year-old information technology:

00:02:15.216 --> 00:02:16.892
the printing press.

00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:21.397
When the ones who were considered citizens

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.176
could no longer participate
in the decision-making spaces

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.165
nor have access to the information
needed to make those decisions,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.526
then a system based
on intermediaries was designed.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.309
Those representatives were intermediaries
between citizens and those spaces

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.590
where the decisions
that impacted their lives were made.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.188
And that's the same democracy
we have nowadays.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.556
But society has changed. Look at this.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.866
This is the papal inauguration ceremony
back in 2005 and the same picture in 2013.

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:06.616
Today, if we want to know
about any subject,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.454
we've just got to go to Wikipedia

00:03:09.478 --> 00:03:12.750
or we can even search
for a TED talk about it.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.294
Who hasn't been informed
first by a Twitter user

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.256
about some event
in any place around the world

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.610
rather than by the traditional media?

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.136
Who hasn't posted,
or seen posted, something like:

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.306
"I'm looking for a partner,"
"This is my CV,"

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.599
"I need to rent an apartment"?

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.794
Today, it's more likely
to get a job through Linkedln

00:03:39.106 --> 00:03:41.498
than through an agency,

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:45.244
and an apartment through Facebook
than through a real estate broker.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.731
Not to mention
how connectivity transformed

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:53.164
the culture and entertainment industry.

00:03:54.154 --> 00:03:58.263
Even our perception
of property is changing.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.732
Do we want to have the actual CD

00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:05.726
or to listen to the music?

00:04:07.586 --> 00:04:11.360
Do we want to have the DVD
stored on a bookshelf

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.767
or to watch the movie?

00:04:15.096 --> 00:04:19.565
The Internet dramatically lowers
the barriers of access to information

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:24.694
and makes us both producers
and consumers of information.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.329
The Internet sets us up
on a peer-to-peer network

00:04:28.353 --> 00:04:30.102
with no intermediaries,

00:04:30.126 --> 00:04:34.490
and we can all participate
in the large virtual global conversation.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.356
The Internet turned
that few-to-many conversation

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.649
into a many-to-many conversation,
it democratized it.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.236
And we are seeing that in every field:

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.632
in culture, in education,

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:53.579
in work organization, socially,
and even in the economy.

00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:57.333
But what about politics?

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.319
The political system insists
on excluding us

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:04.142
from the decision-making spaces.

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:09.209
And the consequence, worldwide, is this.

00:05:11.594 --> 00:05:14.146
It's a clash between a system

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.299
that doesn't represent anymore

00:05:17.903 --> 00:05:21.098
and has no capacity for dialogue

00:05:21.356 --> 00:05:25.578
and a lot of citizens
that are getting increasingly used to

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.535
representing themselves,
without intermediaries.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.643
Look. Occupy Wall Street,

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:37.456
the Spanish indignados,
the Chilean students,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.676
the Arab Spring,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.803
they are all examples
of this global representation crisis.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.359
I saw all this steam

00:05:47.383 --> 00:05:51.092
that our political system's valve
can't contain

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:53.536
and I couldn't help asking myself:

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.220
how are we going to go
from agitation to construction?

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.326
Because it seems that we can use
social networks, at a very low cost,

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.970
to organize massive demonstrations.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.030
But what's not debated is
what we want to do afterwards.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.750
What institutions do we want
to build for this new network society?

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.508
So, if the Internet
is the new printing press,

00:06:26.942 --> 00:06:29.262
the question we have to ask ourselves is:

00:06:30.742 --> 00:06:33.290
Which is the democracy
of the Internet era?

00:06:35.213 --> 00:06:38.433
Which is the democracy
of the Internet era?

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.077
Together with a group of people
we started, here, in Argentina,

00:06:44.101 --> 00:06:47.626
a foundation called "Democracia en Red",

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:53.036
that aims at thinking
how we can transform all this noise

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.821
into a signal with a direct influence
on the system.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.526
And we started to see many examples
all around the world

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.876
and decided to create
a new way of citizen participation

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.077
and social thinking
for the local legislatures.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.022
We asked ourselves how we could make
the most of this new technology

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.040
to make our representatives represent us.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.660
There are two reasons
why we chose this path.

00:07:27.478 --> 00:07:32.121
The first one is that we believe
participation costs are too high.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.386
If participating in politics means

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.246
to be an active member
of a political party since college

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.066
so that some day, we might have our seat
at the table of some political party

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.018
that takes some decision;

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.106
if participating in politics means
to put a table in a corner,

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.382
collect 4,000 signatures, propose a bill,

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:55.823
and then wait for our legislators
to look at it;

00:07:57.452 --> 00:08:00.566
if participating in politics
means having to be a lawyer

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:05.226
to understand what the laws
that regulate our lives are about,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.042
well, then clearly only a few
will want to participate.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.276
But, what if we make it easier
for the citizen?

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.325
What if we can create a space

00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:19.536
where even those who have
only one free hour a week,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.637
but care about their city
and have something to say, can do so?

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.465
The second reason why we chose this path

00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:34.241
is because we believe
that we make better decisions

00:08:34.265 --> 00:08:37.342
when we listen
to as many voices as possible.

00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:40.100
Then why do we think that a legislator,

00:08:40.124 --> 00:08:44.001
working alone will be better able
to bring together

00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:48.736
all the aspects involved in the drafting
and implementation of a law

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.838
than if he works with those
directly affected by that law?

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.410
Now, how can we put 100,000 ideas
in a single legislative seat?

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.812
How can a legislator incarnate
all those different points of view?

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:09.070
Well, once again, let's use
technology to explore that path.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.794
So, the system we designed
has two components.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.276
It's called Democracy OS

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.062
with an online and an offline component.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.798
The online component is a social network
for democratic participation.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.951
It's a platform that will allow us
to stay informed, debate, and decide

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.200
how we want our legislators to vote.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.676
Informing ourselves is key.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.150
Now I'm going to read a -

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.813
well, a law, it's not a bill but a law -

00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:51.293
"Remove from the future
urban zoning district UF

00:09:51.317 --> 00:09:56.211
of the urban planning code, fractions C
and H of block 75A section 92,

00:09:56.235 --> 00:09:59.957
subdivision 1 and affect it
to district U, urbaniza..."

00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:02.202
Well, you get what I mean.

00:10:02.226 --> 00:10:04.519
This is not a joke.
This is the way things are.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.391
What this means is that they'll change

00:10:08.415 --> 00:10:12.331
the zoning of two blocks
in order to build high-rises.

00:10:13.001 --> 00:10:15.691
Oh, well, that's something else.

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:18.915
If we knew that they're planning to build
a high-rise at the corner,

00:10:18.939 --> 00:10:21.226
wouldn't we have
something to say about it?

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.826
I don't know, we might be OK with it.
Or we might not.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.313
But if we don't get informed,

00:10:26.337 --> 00:10:29.393
if we don't know, then we'll never
be able to have a say in it.

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:31.575
So, the first thing we're going to do

00:10:31.599 --> 00:10:34.618
is to list every bill
that is being currently discussed,

00:10:34.642 --> 00:10:38.193
and we're going to explain them
so that everyone can understand.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:44.296
And now, once we've found things out,
we are informed and have an opinion,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.724
what happens today with those opinions?

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.899
They end up in a coffee conversation

00:10:49.923 --> 00:10:53.926
or find their way in the comments section
of an online newspaper?

00:10:55.636 --> 00:11:01.745
But, what if we can create a space
that gathers all those opinions together?

00:11:02.158 --> 00:11:04.038
Somewhere where they can be discussed,

00:11:04.062 --> 00:11:11.022
where all those ideas end up in bills
that really represent our community.

00:11:11.395 --> 00:11:16.276
Where, if you feel comfortable
on a certain topic, you can vote,

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.474
but if you don't,

00:11:17.498 --> 00:11:20.522
you can delegate your vote
to another person in whom you trust,

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:24.665
but only on that specific topic,
not for two whole years.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.901
Wouldn't you be interested
in participating in a space like that?

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.572
Today, what options
does the system offer us to participate?

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:39.206
A public hearing, on a Tuesday at 11am
in the city's downtown area.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:43.986
Which of you could make it to downtown
at eleven in the morning on a Tuesday

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.714
to give an opinion?

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.596
Why do we have to be physically present
to participate in these spaces?

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.730
And that is our only option.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.839
Nowadays, we can take an online course

00:11:56.863 --> 00:12:00.002
from a university
we'll never see in our lifetime,

00:12:00.026 --> 00:12:01.656
we can finance ourselves

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.410
through micro-donations
from people all around the world,

00:12:04.434 --> 00:12:08.586
we network with people
we'll probably never meet,

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.196
but we can't tell our legislator

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.376
whether we want to fence off
our local park or not?

00:12:14.955 --> 00:12:17.086
Well, it doesn't make much sense, right?

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.626
And here is when this key
offline component comes in:

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.408
the political parties.

00:12:24.432 --> 00:12:26.273
And, why is it key?

00:12:26.297 --> 00:12:27.869
Because in Argentina,

00:12:27.893 --> 00:12:31.203
the monopoly of representation
is held by political parties.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.122
The only way
for this collective intelligence

00:12:36.146 --> 00:12:38.693
to have a direct impact on the system

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:42.196
is through political parties
that run for elections, win seats,

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.201
and commit themselves to vote

00:12:44.225 --> 00:12:47.319
according to whatever is decided
on the platform.

00:12:48.874 --> 00:12:53.246
Imagine a legislator
who goes to the committee meetings

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.730
and films them for everyone to watch.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.338
Or imagine a legislator
talking with the citizens

00:13:00.362 --> 00:13:03.782
in an online forum every Sunday.

00:13:04.488 --> 00:13:05.846
It's not impossible.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.316
It isn't sending a mission
to the Moon, the tools are there.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:13.106
So, the platform we've created
is free and open source

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.596
because what we need are political parties

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.740
who dare change the old way
of decision making,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.607
stop doing it behind citizens' backs

00:13:23.631 --> 00:13:26.104
and start doing it

00:13:26.128 --> 00:13:30.924
together with those directly affected
by those decisions, us.

00:13:33.652 --> 00:13:37.862
Imagine all we could do
if we dared to innovate

00:13:37.886 --> 00:13:41.306
where no one has innovated yet:
in the political system.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.084
Imagine all we could achieve.

00:13:43.743 --> 00:13:47.079
Marshall McLuhan says
that politics is about

00:13:47.103 --> 00:13:51.013
solving today's problems
with yesterday's tools.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.601
Well, it's time to solve
today's problems with today's tools.

00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:58.156
Thank you very much.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.330
(Applause)

00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:04.841
Thank you.
