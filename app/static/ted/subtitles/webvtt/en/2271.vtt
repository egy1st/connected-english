00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:03.828
Behavior is written in the genes.

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:05.684
All of us have innate behaviors;

00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:08.466
all animals are born with behaviors.

00:00:08.868 --> 00:00:13.029
Behaviors which through evolution
have become more complex.

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:14.837
In many aspects,

00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:18.352
behavior in males and females
of the same species is different.

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:20.343
These differences in behavior

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.519
are due to differences in the wiring
of the nervous system.

00:00:23.543 --> 00:00:27.468
At the same time, these differences
in wiring are established genetically.

00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:32.006
Aggression is a behavior
that in general is specific to males.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.275
We see it in species
that are very different,

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:36.236
evolutionarily apart from each other.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.903
The way each one
of these species fights is different

00:00:38.927 --> 00:00:40.427
but the mechanisms are similar

00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:42.572
and the reasons are almost
always the same.

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:46.039
Males fight for females,
for food, or for territory.

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:50.182
I study aggression in flies.

00:00:52.404 --> 00:00:54.706
You are about to see an attack.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.124
One animal is going to stand up

00:00:59.148 --> 00:01:02.172
and is going to hurl its body weight
at his opponent.

00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:08.101
The other one, meanwhile,
is going to try to escape.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.351
Why do I study aggression in flies?

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:13.365
Because the behavior,
that I'm interested in understanding,

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:15.622
is the same, and the system
is much simpler.

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:17.136
It's like studying a model.

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:20.940
Sometimes it happens
that the other animal,

00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:24.917
instead of escaping,
stays and starts to fight.

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:29.252
And then something
we call "boxing" occurs.

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:40.880
Something crucial about attacking
is that only the males do it.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:43.918
The one who attacks first
is much more likely to win.

00:01:43.942 --> 00:01:45.930
And males only attack other males.

00:01:45.954 --> 00:01:47.802
Females never attack.

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:54.439
So, why study behavior in flies?

00:01:54.463 --> 00:01:56.561
Because their behaviors
are the same as ours:

00:01:56.585 --> 00:02:01.277
flies sleep, eat, court, fight,
learn, and remember.

00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:04.267
The nervous system is much simpler;

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.024
and the genes that play a role
in this behavior are very similar.

00:02:08.048 --> 00:02:11.904
So, studying aggression in flies
allows us to understand

00:02:11.928 --> 00:02:14.554
how this behavior develops
in other species.

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:21.262
A key element when deciding
whether to court or attack

00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:24.442
is determining the sex
of the other animal.

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:29.164
All males are programmed to decide
between courtship or aggression,

00:02:29.188 --> 00:02:31.298
but the sensory signals they use

00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:34.693
to see if what is in front of them
is a male or a female are different;

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:38.042
for example, in our species
visual signals are very important.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.983
This is what a fly has in front of itself.

00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:46.876
So, how does it decide?

00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:49.503
Evidently, it somehow makes a decision

00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:52.454
because what it is going to do
is very different in each case.

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:55.359
When there is a male
entering its territory,

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:58.242
it is going to start attacking

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:02.065
and to chase him everywhere
until the other one decides to escape.

00:03:03.014 --> 00:03:05.792
When there is a female,
he extends his wing for her.

00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:07.863
As you can see, he literally courts her.

00:03:10.554 --> 00:03:11.997
He chases her everywhere,

00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:14.435
he sings to her
until he has finally won her over.

00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:19.333
So the question is, how does it know?

00:03:19.357 --> 00:03:20.587
How does it decide?

00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:25.796
What are the key signals that it uses
to decide if it has to court or attack?

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:30.534
If we can identify these signals,
can we change them?

00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:32.567
Can we invert this decision?

00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.860
In insects, like in many species,

00:03:34.884 --> 00:03:38.299
chemical signals called pheromones
are very important.

00:03:38.323 --> 00:03:42.203
These signals are produced
by one animal and detected by another.

00:03:42.753 --> 00:03:44.869
So, then something we decided to do

00:03:44.893 --> 00:03:47.637
was to switch the pheromones,
change the scent.

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:49.231
To make it happen,

00:03:49.255 --> 00:03:53.238
we manipulated the expression
of one gene, called "transformer".

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:57.402
"Transformer" is turned on in females
and turned off in males.

00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:03.230
So, something that we can do
is to mute the "transformer" in females

00:04:04.054 --> 00:04:06.248
and force its acquisition in males.

00:04:06.272 --> 00:04:10.191
In doing so, we masculinize females
and feminize males.

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:13.909
But not all over, we aren't going
to manipulate the entire animal.

00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:15.718
We are going to choose certain parts,

00:04:15.742 --> 00:04:18.519
in particular the cells
which produce pheromones.

00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:24.107
What we can achieve are females
that have masculine pheromones

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.926
or males that have feminine pheromones;

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.765
then we are going to see what happens
when a normal male, unmanipulated,

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.075
meets a female
that has masculine pheromones.

00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:38.225
This is what happens, it attacks her.

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:41.073
When she enters his territory,
he does something

00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:43.543
that he would never do
in front of a normal female,

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:45.269
which is start attacking her.

00:04:46.423 --> 00:04:48.712
When we carried out
the reciprocal experiment,

00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:53.095
what we found was that males
with feminine pheromones were courted.

00:04:55.615 --> 00:04:57.031
What does this mean?

00:04:57.511 --> 00:05:01.366
That males are genetically
programmed to court

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.959
when they find feminine pheromones

00:05:03.983 --> 00:05:07.269
and to attack when they find
masculine pheromones.

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:10.850
But, this behavior,

00:05:11.294 --> 00:05:14.689
this innate behavior
that is wired in the brain -

00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:17.617
court if there are feminine pheromones,

00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:20.174
attack if there are
masculine pheromones -

00:05:20.198 --> 00:05:21.795
can it be changed?

00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:25.439
Could it be that an animal
as simple as a fly

00:05:25.463 --> 00:05:29.890
could learn from its experience
and modify a behavior which is innate,

00:05:29.914 --> 00:05:32.542
something which is wired
in its nervous system?

00:05:34.006 --> 00:05:37.662
To respond to this question,
we did a similar experiment.

00:05:37.686 --> 00:05:39.979
Again, we manipulated the "transformer",

00:05:40.003 --> 00:05:42.312
but this time, in the females' brains.

00:05:43.071 --> 00:05:46.774
These females still have
feminine pheromones

00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:48.528
but they act like males.

00:05:48.976 --> 00:05:52.704
We muted their "transformer" in the brain
to turn them into aggressive females.

00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:56.619
They not only dislike courtship
completely but they also attack.

00:05:58.192 --> 00:05:59.668
We then asked ourselves,

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:03.097
what is a male going to do
when it meets a female

00:06:03.121 --> 00:06:05.964
that has female pheromones
but is aggressive?

00:06:05.988 --> 00:06:09.099
The first thing it's going to do
is court her as much as possible.

00:06:09.123 --> 00:06:12.480
It chases and chases her,
extends its wing, sings to her,

00:06:12.504 --> 00:06:15.950
but the moment comes
when he decides to change his behavior.

00:06:16.556 --> 00:06:19.221
The moment comes
after so much ineffective courting

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.403
and in addition to being attacked by her;

00:06:21.427 --> 00:06:24.012
he says, "Enough is enough"
and ends up attacking her.

00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:28.723
This means that even an animal
as simple as a fly

00:06:29.334 --> 00:06:33.185
can learn from its experience
and modify its behavior.

00:06:33.576 --> 00:06:35.147
And not only that.

00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:39.807
When there are fights between two males,
there is always a winner and a loser.

00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:42.133
After a male loses many times

00:06:42.157 --> 00:06:44.939
what happens is that
he suppresses this behavior.

00:06:44.963 --> 00:06:46.275
He stops fighting.

00:06:47.566 --> 00:06:51.474
This means that even in an animal
as simple as a fly

00:06:51.498 --> 00:06:54.050
not only behavior is in the genes,

00:06:54.074 --> 00:06:57.900
but the ability to learn from experience
and modify it is there, too.

00:06:57.924 --> 00:06:59.158
Thank you very much.

00:06:59.182 --> 00:07:01.133
(Applause)
