00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:02.944
I'm really excited to share with you

00:00:02.944 --> 00:00:05.534
some findings that really surprise me

00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:08.085
about what makes companies 
succeed the most,

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:11.987
what factors actually matter the most
for startup success.

00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:15.212
I believe that the startup organization

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:18.970
is one of the greatest forms
to make the world a better place.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.756
If you take a group of people 
with the right equity incentives

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.635
and organize them in a startup,

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:28.609
you can unlock human potential
in a way never before possible.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.139
You get them to achieve 
unbelievable things.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.799
But if the startup 
organization is so great,

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.281
why do so many fail?

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:36.878
That's what I wanted to find out.

00:00:36.878 --> 00:00:39.363
I wanted to find out what
actually matters most

00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:40.573
for startup success.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.782
And I wanted to try 
to be systematic about it,

00:00:42.782 --> 00:00:45.935
avoid some of my instincts
and maybe misperceptions I have

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:48.201
from so many companies
I've seen over the years.

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:49.428
I wanted to know this

00:00:49.428 --> 00:00:52.476
because I've been starting businesses
since I was 12 years old

00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:55.131
when I sold candy at the bus stop
in junior high school,

00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:57.442
to high school, when I made
solar energy devices,

00:00:57.442 --> 00:00:59.229
to college, when I made loudspeakers.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.255
And when I graduated from college,
I started software companies.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:04.064
And 20 years ago,
I started Idealab,

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.305
and in the last 20 years,
we started more than 100 companies,

00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:09.629
many successes, and many big failures.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:11.458
We learned a lot from those failures.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.735
So I tried to look across what factors

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:17.898
accounted the most for company
success and failure.

00:01:17.898 --> 00:01:19.458
So I looked at these five.

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:20.418
First, the idea.

00:01:20.418 --> 00:01:22.574
I used to think that 
the idea was everything.

00:01:22.574 --> 00:01:24.881
I named my company Idealab
for how much I worship

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:27.474
the "aha!" moment when you first
come up with the idea.

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:28.385
But then over time,

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.970
I came to think that maybe the team,
the execution, adaptability,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.121
that mattered even more than the idea.

00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:38.483
I never thought I'd be quoting
boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,

00:01:38.483 --> 00:01:40.342
but he once said,

00:01:40.342 --> 00:01:44.945
"Everybody has a plan, until they get
punched in the face." (Laughter)

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:47.864
And I think that's so true
about business as well.

00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:50.140
So much about a team's execution


00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.900
is its ability to adapt to getting punched
in the face by the customer.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.588
The customer is the true reality.

00:01:55.588 --> 00:01:57.039
And that's why I came to think

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.556
that the team maybe
was the most important thing.

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:02.148
Then I started looking
at the business model.

00:02:02.148 --> 00:02:05.398
Does the company have a very clear path
generating customer revenues?

00:02:05.398 --> 00:02:07.502
That started rising to the top
in my thinking

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.819
about maybe what mattered
most for success.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.216
Then I looked at the funding.

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:13.916
Sometimes companies received
intense amounts of funding.

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:15.754
Maybe that's the most important thing?

00:02:15.754 --> 00:02:17.300
And then of course,
the timing.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.110
Is the idea way too early and
the world's not ready for it?

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.557
Is it early, as in, you're in advance
and you have to educate the world?

00:02:23.557 --> 00:02:24.366
Is it just right?

00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:27.229
Or is it too late, and there's
already too many competitors?

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.818
So I tried to look very carefully
at these five factors

00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:30.869
across many companies.

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.064
And I looked across all 100
Idealab companies,

00:02:33.064 --> 00:02:34.518
and 100 non-Idealab companies

00:02:34.518 --> 00:02:37.154
to try and come up with 
something scientific about it.

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.899
So first, on these Idealab companies,

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.772
the top five companies --

00:02:41.772 --> 00:02:45.188
Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo,
NetZero, Tickets.com --

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:47.262
those all became billion-dollar successes.

00:02:47.262 --> 00:02:49.175
And the five companies on the bottom --

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.985
Z.com, Insider Pages, MyLife,
Desktop Factory, Peoplelink --

00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:54.376
we all had high hopes for,
but didn't succeed.

00:02:54.888 --> 00:02:57.833
So I tried to rank across all 
of those attributes

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.075
how I felt those companies scored
on each of those dimensions.

00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:04.540
And then for non-Idealab companies,
I looked at wild successes,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.122
like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber
and Youtube and LinkedIn.

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:09.385
And some failures:

00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:11.185
Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.com

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:12.465
Flooz and Friendster.

00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:14.469
The bottom companies had intense funding,

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.548
they even had business models
in some cases,

00:03:16.548 --> 00:03:17.695
but they didn't succeed.

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:20.556
I tried to look at what factors
actually accounted the most

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:23.109
for success and failure across
all of these companies,

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.938
and the results really surprised me.

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.008
The number one thing was timing.

00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:30.140
Timing accounted for 42 percent

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.640
of the difference
between success and failure.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.742
Team and execution came in second,

00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:35.564
and the idea,

00:03:35.564 --> 00:03:38.481
the differentiability of the idea,
the uniqueness of the idea,

00:03:38.481 --> 00:03:39.884
that actually came in third.

00:03:39.884 --> 00:03:41.849
Now, this isn't absolutely definitive,

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.066
it's not to say that 
the idea isn't important,

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:47.706
but it very much surprised me that
the idea wasn't the most important thing.

00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:50.306
Sometimes it mattered more when 
it was actually timed.

00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:53.681
The last two, business model and funding,
made sense to me actually.

00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:56.048
I think business model
makes sense to be that low

00:03:56.048 --> 00:03:58.428
because you can start out
without a business model

00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:01.895
and add one later if your customers
are demanding what you're creating.

00:04:01.895 --> 00:04:03.301
And funding, I think as well,

00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:06.076
if you're underfunded at first
but you're gaining traction,

00:04:06.076 --> 00:04:07.365
especially in today's age,

00:04:07.365 --> 00:04:09.426
it's very, very easy to get
intense funding.

00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:12.546
So now let me give you some specific
examples about each of these.

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:15.459
So take a wild success like Airbnb
that everybody knows about.

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.524
Well, that company was famously
passed on by many smart investors

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:19.666
because people thought,

00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:22.719
"No one's going to rent out a space
in their home to a stranger."

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:24.444
Of course, people proved that wrong.

00:04:24.444 --> 00:04:26.298
But one of the reasons it succeeded,

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:29.283
aside from a good business model,
a good idea, great execution,

00:04:29.283 --> 00:04:30.020
is the timing.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.299
That company came out
right during the height of the recession

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:35.117
when people really needed extra money,

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:36.931
and that maybe helped people overcome

00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:39.777
their objection to renting out
their own home to a stranger.

00:04:39.777 --> 00:04:40.896
Same thing with Uber.

00:04:40.896 --> 00:04:41.949
Uber came out,

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.110
incredible company,
incredible business model,

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.174
great execution, too.

00:04:45.174 --> 00:04:46.656
But the timing was so perfect

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.805
for their need to get drivers
into the system.

00:04:48.805 --> 00:04:51.927
Drivers were looking for extra money;
it was very, very important.

00:04:51.927 --> 00:04:55.705
Some of our early successes, Citysearch,
came out when people needed web pages.

00:04:55.705 --> 00:04:58.182
GoTo.com, which we announced
actually at TED in 1998,

00:04:58.182 --> 00:05:01.513
was when companies were looking for
cost-effective ways to get traffic.

00:05:01.513 --> 00:05:03.085
We thought the idea was so great,

00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:05.846
but actually, the timing was probably
maybe more important.

00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:07.284
And then some of our failures.

00:05:07.284 --> 00:05:10.761
We started a company called Z.com,
it was an online entertainment company.

00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:12.204
We were so excited about it --

00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:14.746
we raised enough money,
we had a great business model,

00:05:14.746 --> 00:05:17.994
we even signed incredibly great
Hollywood talent to join the company.

00:05:17.994 --> 00:05:20.382
But broadband penetration
was too low in 1999-2000.

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:22.538
It was too hard to watch
video content online,

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:25.347
you had to put codecs in your browser
and do all this stuff,

00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:27.978
and the company eventually
went out of business in 2003.

00:05:27.978 --> 00:05:29.074
Just two years later,

00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:31.959
when the codec problem
was solved by Adobe Flash

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:35.633
and when broadband penetration
crossed 50 percent in America,

00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:37.590
YouTube was perfectly timed.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.319
Great idea, but unbelievable timing.

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:42.759
In fact, YouTube didn't even have
a business model when it first started.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.042
It wasn't even certain that 
that would work out.

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:47.177
But that was beautifully, 
beautifully timed.

00:05:47.177 --> 00:05:48.728
So what I would say, in summary,

00:05:48.728 --> 00:05:51.513
is execution definitely matters a lot.

00:05:51.513 --> 00:05:52.757
The idea matters a lot.

00:05:52.757 --> 00:05:54.516
But timing might matter even more.

00:05:54.516 --> 00:05:56.562
And the best way to really assess timing

00:05:56.562 --> 00:05:59.179
is to really look at whether 
consumers are really ready

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:00.715
for what you have to offer them.

00:06:00.715 --> 00:06:02.677
And to be really, really honest about it,

00:06:02.677 --> 00:06:04.938
not be in denial about
any results that you see,

00:06:04.938 --> 00:06:08.149
because if you have something you love,
you want to push it forward,

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:11.219
but you have to be very, very honest
about that factor on timing.

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:12.089
As I said earlier,

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.478
I think startups can change the world
and make the world a better place.

00:06:15.478 --> 00:06:16.876
I hope some of these insights

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.528
can maybe help you
have a slightly higher success ratio,

00:06:19.528 --> 00:06:21.748
and thus make something great
come to the world

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:23.594
that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

00:06:23.594 --> 00:06:25.931
Thank you very much,
you've been a great audience.

00:06:25.931 --> 00:06:27.425
(Applause)
