00:00:01.136 --> 00:00:04.389
In the great 1980s movie 
"The Blues Brothers,"

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:09.183
there's a scene where John Belushi
goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment

00:00:09.183 --> 00:00:11.506
in Chicago for the very first time.

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:14.637
It's a cramped, tiny space

00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:17.168
and it's just three feet away
from the train tracks.

00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:20.466
As John sits on Dan's bed,

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.929
a train goes rushing by,

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.153
rattling everything in the room.

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:28.982
John asks, "How often does
that train go by?"

00:00:28.982 --> 00:00:33.542
Dan replies, "So often, you won't
even notice it."

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:36.448
And then, something falls off the wall.

00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:39.042
We all know what he's talking about.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:41.883
As human beings, we get used
to everyday things

00:00:41.883 --> 00:00:43.080
really fast.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.984
As a product designer,
it's my job to see those everyday things,

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:50.521
to feel them, and try
to improve upon them.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:54.861
For example, see this piece of fruit?

00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:57.811
See this little sticker?

00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:01.666
That sticker wasn't there
when I was a kid.

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:04.694
But somewhere as the years passed,

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:07.575
someone had the bright idea
to put that sticker on the fruit.

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:08.292
Why?

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:09.821
So it could be easier for us 


00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:11.558
to check out 
at the grocery counter.

00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:12.651
Well that's great,

00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:14.706
we can get in and out of
the store quickly.

00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:16.784
But now, there's a new problem.

00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:19.443
When we get home and we're hungry

00:01:19.443 --> 00:01:22.874
and we see this ripe, juicy piece
of fruit on the counter,

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:25.719
we just want to pick it up
and eat it.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.455
Except now, we have to look
for this little sticker.

00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:34.961
And dig at it with our nails,
damaging the flesh.

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:36.601
Then rolling up that sticker --

00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:37.636
you know what I mean.

00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:39.775
And then trying to flick
it off your fingers.

00:01:39.775 --> 00:01:43.136
(Applause)

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:45.776
It's not fun,

00:01:45.776 --> 00:01:46.797
not at all.

00:01:47.777 --> 00:01:49.682
But something interesting happened.

00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:53.073
See the first time you did it,
you probably felt those feelings.

00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:55.280
You just wanted to eat the piece of fruit.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.287
You felt upset.

00:01:56.287 --> 00:01:58.021
You just wanted to dive in.

00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:00.165
By the 10th time,

00:02:00.165 --> 00:02:02.641
you started to become less upset

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:06.071
and you just started peeling
the label off.

00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:08.480
By the 100th time,
at least for me,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.612
I became numb to it.

00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:13.103
I simply picked up the piece of fruit,

00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:17.215
dug at it with my nails,
tried to flick it off,

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:18.771
and then wondered,

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:22.270
"Was there another sticker?"

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.974
So why is that?

00:02:24.974 --> 00:02:27.126
Why do we get used to everyday things?

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:30.274
Well as human beings,
we have limited brain power.

00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:35.043
And so our brains encode the 
everyday things we do into habits

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:38.620
so we can free up space 
to learn new things.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.662
It's a process called habituation

00:02:40.662 --> 00:02:44.266
and it's one of the most basic ways,
as humans, we learn.

00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:47.765
Now, habituation isn't always bad.

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:50.611
Remember learning to drive?

00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:52.279
I sure do.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.227
Your hands clenched at 10 and 2
on the wheel,

00:02:56.227 --> 00:02:58.445
looking at every single
object out there --

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:01.695
the cars, the lights, the pedestrians.

00:03:01.695 --> 00:03:04.006
It's a nerve-wracking experience.

00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:08.520
So much so, that I couldn't even
talk to anyone else in the car

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.450
and I couldn't even listen to music.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.949
But then something interesting happened.

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:17.119
As the weeks went by,
driving became easier and easier.

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:19.647
You habituated it.

00:03:20.647 --> 00:03:22.914
It started to become 
fun and second nature.

00:03:23.324 --> 00:03:25.531
And then, you could talk 
to your friends again

00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:26.490
and listen to music.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.189
So there's a good reason why
our brains habituate things.

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.552
If we didn't, we'd notice
every little detail,

00:03:32.552 --> 00:03:34.167
all the time.

00:03:34.717 --> 00:03:36.295
It would be exhausting,

00:03:36.295 --> 00:03:38.687
and we'd have no time
to learn about new things.

00:03:40.317 --> 00:03:43.457
But sometimes,
habituation isn't good.

00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:47.812
If it stops us from noticing 
the problems that are around us,

00:03:47.812 --> 00:03:48.843
well, that's bad.

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:52.816
And if it stops us from noticing 
and fixing those problems,

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:54.933
well, then that's really bad.

00:03:55.923 --> 00:03:57.906
Comedians know all about this.

00:03:57.906 --> 00:04:02.791
Jerry Seinfeld's entire career was built
on noticing those little details,

00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:06.769
those idiotic things we do every day
that we don't even remember.

00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:10.615
He tells us about the time 
he visited his friends

00:04:10.615 --> 00:04:13.001
and he just wanted to take 
a comfortable shower.

00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.898
He'd reach out and grab the handle
and turn it slightly one way,

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.483
and it was 100 degrees too hot.

00:04:19.483 --> 00:04:23.415
And then he'd turn it the other way,
and it was 100 degrees too cold.

00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:25.778
He just wanted a comfortable shower.

00:04:25.778 --> 00:04:27.941
Now, we've all been there,

00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.726
we just don't remember it.

00:04:29.726 --> 00:04:31.048
But Jerry did,

00:04:31.048 --> 00:04:33.062
and that's a comedian's job.

00:04:33.062 --> 00:04:36.182
But designers, innovators 
and entrepreneurs,

00:04:36.182 --> 00:04:38.589
it's our job to not just notice
those things,

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:41.525
but to go one step further
and try to fix them.

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:44.842
See this, this person,

00:04:44.842 --> 00:04:46.311
this is Mary Anderson.

00:04:46.581 --> 00:04:48.778
In 1902 in New York City,

00:04:48.778 --> 00:04:50.606
she was visiting.

00:04:51.016 --> 00:04:55.834
It was a cold, wet, snowy day
and she was warm inside a streetcar.

00:04:57.226 --> 00:05:02.323
As she was going to her destination,
she noticed the driver opening the window

00:05:02.323 --> 00:05:07.128
to clean off the excess snow
so he could drive safely.

00:05:08.258 --> 00:05:11.834
When he opened the window, though,
he let all this cold, wet air inside,

00:05:11.834 --> 00:05:13.779
making all the passengers miserable.

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:18.122
Now probably, most of those 
passengers just thought,

00:05:18.122 --> 00:05:21.373
"It's a fact of life, he's got
to open the window to clean it.

00:05:21.373 --> 00:05:22.766
That's just how it is."

00:05:23.176 --> 00:05:24.711
But Mary didn't.

00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:26.010
Mary thought,

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.844
"What if the diver could actually clean
the windshield from the inside

00:05:29.844 --> 00:05:33.122
so that he could stay safe and drive

00:05:33.122 --> 00:05:36.063
and the passengers could 
actually stay warm?"

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:39.355
So she picked up her sketchbook
right then and there,

00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:43.716
and began drawing what would become
the world's first windshield wiper.

00:05:44.924 --> 00:05:49.194
Now as a product designer,
I try to learn from people like Mary

00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:51.963
to try to see the world 
the way it really is,

00:05:51.973 --> 00:05:54.047
not the way we think it is.

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:55.534
Why?

00:05:55.534 --> 00:05:58.881
Because it's easy to solve a problem
that almost everyone sees.

00:05:59.894 --> 00:06:03.674
But it's hard to solve a problem
that almost no one sees.

00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:07.169
Now some people think
you're born with this ability

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.750
or you're not,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.693
as if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birth
to see the world more clearly.

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:16.813
That wasn't the case for me.

00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:18.456
I had to work at it.

00:06:19.766 --> 00:06:22.395
During my years at Apple,

00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:27.142
Steve Jobs challenged us
to come into work every day,

00:06:27.142 --> 00:06:31.056
to see our products through 
the eyes of the customer,

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:32.503
the new customer,

00:06:32.503 --> 00:06:35.689
the one that has fears 
and possible frustrations

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:38.830
and hopeful exhilaration that their
new technology product

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.851
could work straightaway for them.

00:06:41.471 --> 00:06:43.705
He called it staying beginners,

00:06:43.705 --> 00:06:47.687
and wanted to make sure that we
focused on those tiny little details

00:06:47.687 --> 00:06:51.845
to make them faster, easier and seamless
for the new customers.

00:06:52.558 --> 00:06:56.805
So I remember this clearly
in the very earliest days of the iPod.

00:06:57.028 --> 00:06:58.698
See, back in the '90s,

00:06:58.698 --> 00:07:01.127
being a gadget freak like I am,

00:07:03.107 --> 00:07:08.002
I would rush out to the store
for the very, very latest gadget.

00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:11.353
I'd take all the time to get to the store,

00:07:11.353 --> 00:07:14.964
I'd check out, I'd come back home,
I'd start to unbox it.

00:07:14.964 --> 00:07:18.890
And then, there was 
another little sticker:

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.005
the one that said, "Charge before use."

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:23.553
What!

00:07:23.553 --> 00:07:24.558
I can't believe it!

00:07:24.558 --> 00:07:26.734
I just spent all this time
buying this product

00:07:26.734 --> 00:07:28.768
and now I have to charge before use.

00:07:28.768 --> 00:07:33.158
I have to wait what felt like an eternity
to use that coveted new toy.

00:07:33.158 --> 00:07:34.850
It was crazy.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.755
But you know what?

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:37.838
Almost every product back then did that.

00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:39.613
When it had batteries in it,

00:07:39.613 --> 00:07:41.890
you had to charge it
before you used it.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.136
Well, Steve noticed that

00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:45.967
and he said,

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:48.565
"We're not going to let that 
happen to our product."

00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:50.413
So what did we do?

00:07:50.413 --> 00:07:53.499
Typically, when you have a product
that has a hard drive in it,

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:56.162
you run it for about 
30 minutes in the factory

00:07:56.162 --> 00:07:59.311
to make sure that hard drive's going 
to be working years later

00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:02.385
for the customer after they 
pull it out of the box.

00:08:02.385 --> 00:08:05.451
What did we do instead?

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.541
We ran that product for over two hours.

00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:09.129
Why?

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:12.254
Well, first off, we could make
a higher quality product,

00:08:12.254 --> 00:08:14.404
be easy to test,

00:08:14.404 --> 00:08:17.346
and make sure it was great
for the customer.

00:08:17.906 --> 00:08:19.159
But most importantly,

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:22.178
the battery came fully charged
right out of the box,

00:08:22.178 --> 00:08:23.124
ready to use.

00:08:23.124 --> 00:08:26.956
So that customer, 
with all that exhilaration,

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:28.684
could just start using the product.

00:08:28.684 --> 00:08:31.074
It was great, and it worked.

00:08:31.074 --> 00:08:32.338
People liked it.

00:08:32.338 --> 00:08:35.445
Today, almost every product
that you get that's battery powered

00:08:35.445 --> 00:08:37.508
comes out of the box fully charged,

00:08:37.508 --> 00:08:39.561
even if it doesn't have a hard drive.

00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:44.905
But back then, we noticed 
that detail and we fixed it,

00:08:44.905 --> 00:08:47.253
and now everyone else does that as well.

00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:49.894
No more, "Charge before use."

00:08:50.644 --> 00:08:52.701
So why am I telling you this?

00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:54.809
Well, it's seeing the invisible problem,

00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:59.320
not just the obvious problem,
that's important,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.160
not just for product design,
but for everything we do.

00:09:02.682 --> 00:09:06.206
You see, there are invisible problems
all around us,

00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:08.462
ones we can solve.

00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:12.286
But first we need
to see them, to feel them.

00:09:12.996 --> 00:09:14.964
So, I'm hesitant to give you any tips

00:09:14.964 --> 00:09:17.695
about neuroscience or psychology.

00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:20.689
There's far too many experienced people
in the TED community

00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:24.083
who would know much more
about that than I ever will.

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:26.710
But let me leave you with
a few tips that I do,

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.383
that we all can do,
to fight habituation.

00:09:30.383 --> 00:09:33.777
My first tip is to look broader.

00:09:33.777 --> 00:09:35.889
You see, when you're tackling a problem,

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:39.281
sometimes, there are a lot of steps
that lead up to that problem.

00:09:39.281 --> 00:09:42.351
And sometimes, a lot 
of steps after it.

00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:45.700
If you can take a step back
and look broader,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.971
maybe you can change some of those boxes

00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:48.977
before the problem.

00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:50.337
Maybe you can combine them.

00:09:50.337 --> 00:09:53.672
Maybe you can remove them altogether
to make that better.

00:09:54.258 --> 00:09:56.249
Take thermostats, for instance.

00:09:56.249 --> 00:09:59.627
In the 1900s when they first came out,
they were really simple to use.

00:09:59.627 --> 00:10:01.579
You could turn them up or turn them down.

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:03.279
People understood them.

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:05.772
But in the 1970s,

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.846
the energy crisis struck,

00:10:07.846 --> 00:10:11.416
and customers started thinking about
how to save energy.

00:10:11.416 --> 00:10:12.703
So what happened?

00:10:12.703 --> 00:10:15.731
Thermostat designers decided 
to add a new step.

00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:17.581
Instead of just turning up and down,

00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:19.572
you now had to program it.

00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:22.790
So you could tell it the temperature
you wanted at a certain time.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.586
Now that seemed great.

00:10:24.586 --> 00:10:28.064
Every thermostat had
started adding that feature.

00:10:28.064 --> 00:10:32.340
But it turned out that no one
saved any energy.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.853
Now, why is that?

00:10:33.853 --> 00:10:36.588
Well, people couldn't predict the future.

00:10:36.588 --> 00:10:40.136
They just didn't know how their weeks
would change season to season,

00:10:40.136 --> 00:10:41.634
year to year.

00:10:42.414 --> 00:10:44.745
So no one was saving energy,

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:45.727
and what happened?

00:10:45.727 --> 00:10:48.350
Thermostat designers went back
to the drawing board

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.392
and they focused on that programming step.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:53.409
They made better U.I.s,

00:10:53.409 --> 00:10:55.575
they made better documentation.

00:10:55.575 --> 00:11:00.305
But still, years later,
people were not saving any energy

00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:02.901
because they just couldn't
predict the future.

00:11:03.431 --> 00:11:04.909
So what did we do?

00:11:04.909 --> 00:11:08.978
We put a machine-learning algorithm in
instead of the programming

00:11:08.978 --> 00:11:11.676
that would simply watch
when you turned it up and down,

00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:14.270
when you liked a certain temperature
when you got up,

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.977
or when you went away.

00:11:15.977 --> 00:11:17.245
And you know what?

00:11:17.245 --> 00:11:18.172
It worked.

00:11:18.422 --> 00:11:21.639
People are saving energy 
without any programming.

00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:25.246
So, it doesn't matter what you're doing.

00:11:25.246 --> 00:11:28.512
If you take a step back 
and look at all the boxes,

00:11:28.512 --> 00:11:31.533
maybe there's a way
to remove one or combine them

00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:34.047
so that you can make 
that process much simpler.

00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:38.084
So that's my first tip: look broader.

00:11:38.084 --> 00:11:42.065
For my second tip, it's to look closer.

00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:45.096
One of my greatest teachers 
was my grandfather.

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:48.907
He taught me all about the world.

00:11:49.557 --> 00:11:53.049
He taught me how things were built
and how they were repaired,

00:11:53.049 --> 00:11:56.771
the tools and techniques necessary
to make a successful project.

00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:02.008
I remember one story 
he told me about screws,

00:12:02.048 --> 00:12:05.678
and about how you need to have
the right screw for the right job.

00:12:05.678 --> 00:12:07.617
There are many different screws:

00:12:07.617 --> 00:12:12.487
wood screws, metal screws,
anchors, concrete screws,

00:12:12.487 --> 00:12:14.232
the list went on and on.

00:12:15.212 --> 00:12:18.485
Our job is to make products
that are easy to install

00:12:18.485 --> 00:12:22.219
for all of our customs themselves
without professionals.

00:12:22.789 --> 00:12:24.210
So what did we do?

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.655
I remembered that story 
that my grandfather told me,

00:12:27.655 --> 00:12:28.928
and so we thought,

00:12:28.928 --> 00:12:31.428
"How many different screws 
can we put in the box?

00:12:31.428 --> 00:12:34.278
Was it going to be two, three,
four, five?

00:12:34.278 --> 00:12:36.574
Because there's so many
different wall types."

00:12:36.574 --> 00:12:39.304
So we thought about it, we optimized it,

00:12:39.304 --> 00:12:43.395
and we came up with three different
screws to put in the box.

00:12:43.845 --> 00:12:46.122
We thought that was going
to solve the problem.

00:12:46.122 --> 00:12:48.817
But it turned out, it didn't.

00:12:49.527 --> 00:12:51.158
So we shipped the product,

00:12:51.158 --> 00:12:53.548
and people weren't having
a great experience.

00:12:54.128 --> 00:12:55.336
So what did we do?

00:12:55.336 --> 00:12:57.081
We went back to the drawing board

00:12:57.081 --> 00:13:00.545
just instantly after we figured out
we didn't get it right.

00:13:00.545 --> 00:13:04.269
And we designed a special screw,
a custom screw,

00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:06.440
much to the chagrin of our investors.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.862
They were like, "Why are you spending
so much time on a little screw?

00:13:09.862 --> 00:13:11.861
Get out there and sell more!"


00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:15.184
And we said, "We will sell more
if we get this right."

00:13:15.904 --> 00:13:17.594
And it turned out, we did.

00:13:17.594 --> 00:13:20.888
With that custom little screw,
there was just one screw in the box,

00:13:20.888 --> 00:13:23.995
that was easy to mount
and put on the wall.

00:13:25.525 --> 00:13:31.625
So if we focus on those tiny details,
the ones we may not see

00:13:32.404 --> 00:13:34.228
and we look at them as we say,

00:13:34.228 --> 00:13:35.636
"Are those important

00:13:35.636 --> 00:13:38.436
or is that the way we've always done it?

00:13:38.436 --> 00:13:41.320
Maybe there's a way to get rid of those."

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.839
So my last piece of advice
is to think younger.

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:52.545
Every day, I'm confronted with interesting
questions from my three young kids.

00:13:52.545 --> 00:13:54.316
They come up with questions like,

00:13:54.316 --> 00:13:57.224
"Why can't cars fly around traffic?"

00:13:57.644 --> 00:14:01.420
Or, "Why don't my shoelaces
have Velcro instead?"

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.389
Sometimes, those questions are smart.

00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:07.947
My son came to me the other day
and I asked him,

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:11.123
"Go run out to the mailbox 
and check it."

00:14:11.123 --> 00:14:14.891
He looked at me, puzzled, and said,

00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:20.225
"Why doesn't the mailbox just check itself
and tell us when it has mail?" (Laughter)

00:14:20.225 --> 00:14:23.878
I was like, "That's a pretty 
good question."

00:14:24.878 --> 00:14:27.492
So, they can ask tons of questions

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:32.210
and sometimes we find out
we just don't have the right answers.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:38.017
We say, "Son, that's just the way
the world works."

00:14:38.017 --> 00:14:40.567
So the more we're exposed to something,

00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:42.764
the more we get used to it.

00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:44.894
But kids haven't been around 
long enough

00:14:44.894 --> 00:14:46.794
to get used to those things.

00:14:46.794 --> 00:14:48.611
And so when they run into problems,

00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:50.834
they immediately try to solve them,

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:53.576
and sometimes they find a better way,

00:14:53.576 --> 00:14:56.280
and that way really is better.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.119
So my advice that we take to heart
is to have young people on your team,

00:15:02.119 --> 00:15:04.225
or people with young minds.

00:15:04.225 --> 00:15:06.576
Because if you have those young minds,

00:15:06.576 --> 00:15:09.736
they cause everyone in the room
to think younger.

00:15:09.736 --> 00:15:14.100
Picasso once said, 
"Every child is an artist.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:20.406
The problem is when he or she grows up,
is how to remain an artist."

00:15:21.785 --> 00:15:25.734
We all saw the world more clearly
when we saw it for the first time,

00:15:25.734 --> 00:15:28.308
before a lifetime of habits 
got in the way.


00:15:28.998 --> 00:15:31.341
Our challenge is to get back there,

00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:33.586
to feel that frustration,

00:15:33.586 --> 00:15:35.926
to see those little details,

00:15:35.926 --> 00:15:37.666
to look broader,

00:15:37.666 --> 00:15:39.422
look closer,

00:15:39.422 --> 00:15:41.092
and to think younger

00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:43.710
so we can stay beginners.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.373
It's not easy.

00:15:45.373 --> 00:15:46.908
It requires us pushing back

00:15:46.908 --> 00:15:50.109
against one of the most basic ways
we make sense of the world.

00:15:51.689 --> 00:15:52.732
But if we do,

00:15:52.732 --> 00:15:55.243
we could do some pretty amazing things.

00:15:55.243 --> 00:15:57.890
For me, hopefully, that's better
product design.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.517
For you, that could mean something else,
something powerful.

00:16:06.105 --> 00:16:09.169
Our challenge is to wake up 
each day and say,

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:12.344
"How can I experience the world better?"

00:16:12.344 --> 00:16:17.193
And if we do, maybe, just maybe,

00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:21.388
we can get rid of these
dumb little stickers.

00:16:22.248 --> 00:16:23.797
Thank you very much.

00:16:23.797 --> 00:16:26.274
(Applause)
