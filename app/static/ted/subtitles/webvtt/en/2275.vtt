00:00:00.794 --> 00:00:04.151
About 10 years ago, I went through
a little bit of a hard time.

00:00:04.175 --> 00:00:06.449
So I decided to go see a therapist.

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:10.195
I had been seeing her for a few months,
when she looked at me one day and said,

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.063
"Who actually raised you
until you were three?"

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:17.146
Seemed like a weird question.
I said, "My parents."

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.148
And she said, "I don't think
that's actually the case;

00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:22.329
because if it were,

00:00:22.353 --> 00:00:26.175
we'd be dealing with things that are
far more complicated than just this."

00:00:26.906 --> 00:00:30.487
It sounded like the setup to a joke,
but I knew she was serious.

00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:33.200
Because when I first started seeing her,

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:35.830
I was trying to be
the funniest person in the room.

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:40.012
And I would try and crack these jokes,
but she caught on to me really quickly,

00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:43.813
and whenever I tried to make a joke,
she would look at me and say,

00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:46.967
"That is actually really sad."

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:48.888
(Laughter)

00:00:48.912 --> 00:00:50.088
It's terrible.

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:54.044
So I knew I had to be serious,
and I asked my parents

00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:56.642
who had actually raised me
until I was three?

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.040
And to my surprise, they said

00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:02.814
my primary caregiver had been
a distant relative of the family.

00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:05.291
I had called her my auntie.

00:01:06.502 --> 00:01:08.587
I remember my auntie so clearly,

00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:11.834
it felt like she had been part of my life
when I was much older.

00:01:12.312 --> 00:01:14.639
I remember the thick, straight hair,

00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:16.925
and how it would come around
me like a curtain

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:18.290
when she bent to pick me up;

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:20.852
her soft, southern Thai accent;

00:01:20.876 --> 00:01:22.706
the way I would cling to her,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.849
even if she just wanted to go
to the bathroom

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:26.111
or get something to eat.

00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:30.528
I loved her, but [with] the ferocity
that a child has sometimes

00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:35.470
before she understands that love
also requires letting go.

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:40.243
But my clearest and sharpest
memory of my auntie,

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.230
is also one of my first
memories of life at all.

00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:49.099
I remember her being beaten and slapped
by another member of my family.

00:01:49.686 --> 00:01:52.583
I remember screaming hysterically
and wanting it to stop,

00:01:52.607 --> 00:01:55.381
as I did every single time it happened,

00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:58.142
for things as minor as wanting
to go out with her friends,

00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.610
or being a little late.

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:03.268
I became so hysterical over her treatment,

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:07.502
that eventually, she was just
beaten behind closed doors.

00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:12.698
Things got so bad for her
that eventually she ran away.

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:14.996
As an adult, I learned later

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.247
that she had been just 19
when she was brought over from Thailand

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:22.249
to the States to care for me,
on a tourist visa.

00:02:23.674 --> 00:02:25.731
She wound up working
in Illinois for a time,

00:02:25.755 --> 00:02:28.185
before eventually returning to Thailand,

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.129
which is where I ran into her again,
at a political rally in Bangkok.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.592
I clung to her again, as I had
when I was a child,

00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:40.187
and I let go, and then
I promised that I would call.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.571
I never did, though.

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:48.303
Because I was afraid if I said
everything that she meant to me --

00:02:48.327 --> 00:02:53.077
that I owed perhaps the best parts
of who I became to her care,

00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:56.189
and that the words "I'm sorry"
were like a thimble

00:02:56.213 --> 00:03:00.638
to bail out all the guilt
and shame and rage I felt

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:05.133
over everything she had endured
to care for me for as long as she had --

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.949
I thought if I said those words to her,
I would never stop crying again.

00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:14.304
Because she had saved me.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.481
And I had not saved her.

00:03:20.877 --> 00:03:24.321
I'm a journalist, and I've been writing
and researching human trafficking

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:26.446
for the past eight years or so,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.421
and even so, I never put together
this personal story

00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:33.491
with my professional life
until pretty recently.

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:37.553
I think this profound disconnect
actually symbolizes

00:03:37.577 --> 00:03:40.284
most of our understanding
about human trafficking.

00:03:40.977 --> 00:03:46.604
Because human trafficking is far more
prevalent, complex and close to home

00:03:46.628 --> 00:03:48.240
than most of us realize.

00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:51.369
I spent time in jails and brothels,

00:03:51.393 --> 00:03:54.951
interviewed hundreds of survivors
and law enforcement, NGO workers.

00:03:55.578 --> 00:03:58.555
And when I think about what we've done
about human trafficking,

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.483
I am hugely disappointed.

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:04.641
Partly because we don't even talk
about the problem right at all.

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:07.987
When I say "human trafficking,"

00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:11.251
most of you probably don't think
about someone like my auntie.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.551
You probably think
about a young girl or woman,

00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:18.007
who's been brutally forced
into prostitution by a violent pimp.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.625
That is real suffering,
and that is a real story.

00:04:23.578 --> 00:04:24.861
That story makes me angry

00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:28.326
for far more than just the reality
of that situation, though.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.372
As a journalist, I really care about how
we relate to each other through language,

00:04:34.396 --> 00:04:38.087
and the way we tell that story,
with all the gory, violent detail,

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:43.149
the salacious aspects -- I call that
"look at her scars" journalism.

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:46.040
We use that story to convince ourselves

00:04:46.064 --> 00:04:50.678
that human trafficking is a bad man
doing a bad thing to an innocent girl.

00:04:51.328 --> 00:04:53.224
That story lets us off the hook.

00:04:53.248 --> 00:04:56.986
It takes away all the societal context
that we might be indicted for,

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.169
for the structural inequality,
or the poverty,

00:04:59.193 --> 00:05:00.946
or the barriers to migration.

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:02.840
We let ourselves think

00:05:02.864 --> 00:05:06.440
that human trafficking is only
about forced prostitution,

00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:07.979
when in reality,

00:05:08.003 --> 00:05:11.486
human trafficking is embedded
in our everyday lives.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.144
Let me show you what I mean.

00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:19.245
Forced prostitution accounts for
22 percent of human trafficking.

00:05:19.828 --> 00:05:23.799
Ten percent is in state-
imposed forced labor.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:27.986
but a whopping 68 percent
is for the purpose of creating the goods

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.640
and delivering the services
that most of us rely on every day,

00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:36.840
in sectors like agricultural work,
domestic work and construction.

00:05:37.298 --> 00:05:40.381
That is food and care and shelter.

00:05:41.067 --> 00:05:43.429
And somehow, these most essential workers

00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:47.596
are also among the world's most underpaid
and exploited today.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.893
Human trafficking is the use
of force, fraud or coercion

00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:55.917
to compel another person's labor.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.244
And it's found in cotton fields,
and coltan mines,

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:01.806
and even car washes in Norway and England.

00:06:02.245 --> 00:06:05.815
It's found in U.S. military
bases in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.313
It's found in Thailand's fishing industry.

00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:12.634
That country has become the largest
exporter of shrimp in the world.

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:15.574
But what are the circumstances

00:06:15.598 --> 00:06:18.608
behind all that cheap
and plentiful shrimp?

00:06:19.724 --> 00:06:23.965
Thai military were caught selling
Burmese and Cambodian migrants

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:25.349
onto fishing boats.

00:06:25.944 --> 00:06:29.041
Those fishing boats were taken out,
the men put to work,

00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:32.717
and they were thrown overboard
if they made the mistake of falling sick,

00:06:32.741 --> 00:06:34.725
or trying to resist their treatment.

00:06:35.368 --> 00:06:37.863
Those fish were then used to feed shrimp,

00:06:37.887 --> 00:06:42.321
The shrimp were then sold
to four major global retailers:

00:06:42.345 --> 00:06:46.532
Costco, Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour.

00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:52.450
Human trafficking is found
on a smaller scale than just that,

00:06:52.474 --> 00:06:54.672
and in places you would
never even imagine.

00:06:55.016 --> 00:06:58.001
Traffickers have forced young people
to drive ice cream trucks,

00:06:58.025 --> 00:07:00.170
or to sing in touring boys' choirs.

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:04.366
Trafficking has even been found
in a hair braiding salon in New Jersey.

00:07:04.942 --> 00:07:07.029
The scheme in that case was incredible.

00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:13.623
The traffickers found young families
who were from Ghana and Togo,

00:07:13.647 --> 00:07:16.989
and they told these families that
"your daughters are going to get

00:07:17.013 --> 00:07:19.120
a fine education in the United States."

00:07:19.718 --> 00:07:22.376
They then located winners
of the green card lottery,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.261
and they told them, "We'll help you out.

00:07:25.285 --> 00:07:28.264
We'll get you a plane ticket.
We'll pay your fees.

00:07:28.288 --> 00:07:31.260
All you have to do is take
this young girl with you,

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.802
say that she's your sister or your spouse.

00:07:34.998 --> 00:07:38.261
Once everyone arrived in New Jersey,
the young girls were taken away,

00:07:38.285 --> 00:07:40.844
and put to work for 14-hour days,

00:07:40.868 --> 00:07:43.758
seven days a week, for five years.

00:07:44.154 --> 00:07:47.984
They made their traffickers
nearly four million dollars.

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:52.043
This is a huge problem.

00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:54.157
So what have we done about it?

00:07:55.049 --> 00:07:57.482
We've mostly turned
to the criminal justice system.

00:07:58.386 --> 00:08:02.394
But keep in mind, most victims of human
trafficking are poor and marginalized.

00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:04.424
They're migrants, people of color.

00:08:04.448 --> 00:08:06.130
Sometimes they're in the sex trade.

00:08:06.634 --> 00:08:08.800
And for populations like these,

00:08:08.824 --> 00:08:11.862
the criminal justice system is
too often part of the problem,

00:08:11.886 --> 00:08:13.338
rather than the solution.

00:08:14.444 --> 00:08:19.089
In study after study, in countries ranging
from Bangladesh to the United States,

00:08:19.113 --> 00:08:23.850
between 20 and 60 percent of the people
in the sex trade who were surveyed

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:28.542
said that they had been raped or assaulted
by the police in the past year alone.

00:08:30.302 --> 00:08:33.969
People in prostitution, including people
who have been trafficked into it,

00:08:33.993 --> 00:08:37.314
regularly receive multiple
convictions for prostitution.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.873
Having that criminal record makes it
so much more difficult

00:08:40.897 --> 00:08:44.794
to leave poverty, leave abuse,
or leave prostitution,

00:08:44.818 --> 00:08:46.670
if that person so desires.

00:08:48.296 --> 00:08:50.232
Workers outside of the sex sector --

00:08:50.256 --> 00:08:54.284
if they try and resist their treatment,
they risk deportation.

00:08:55.146 --> 00:08:58.328
In case after case I've studied,
employers have no problem

00:08:58.352 --> 00:09:01.795
calling on law enforcement
to try and threaten or deport

00:09:01.819 --> 00:09:03.849
their striking trafficked workers.

00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:06.472
If those workers run away,

00:09:06.496 --> 00:09:11.208
they risk becoming part of the great mass
of undocumented workers

00:09:11.232 --> 00:09:14.684
who are also subject to the whims
of law enforcement if they're caught.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.860
Law enforcement is supposed to identify
victims and prosecute traffickers.

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:28.719
But out of an estimated 21 million victims
of human trafficking in the world,

00:09:28.743 --> 00:09:33.159
they have helped and identified
fewer than 50,000 people.

00:09:33.742 --> 00:09:35.361
That's like comparing

00:09:35.385 --> 00:09:39.256
the population of the world
to the population of Los Angeles,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.581
proportionally speaking.

00:09:41.997 --> 00:09:48.419
As for convictions, out of an estimated
5,700 convictions in 2013,

00:09:48.443 --> 00:09:51.278
fewer than 500 were for labor trafficking.

00:09:51.976 --> 00:09:53.668
Keep in mind that labor trafficking

00:09:53.692 --> 00:09:56.858
accounts for 68 percent
of all trafficking,

00:09:56.882 --> 00:09:59.945
but fewer than 10 percent
of the convictions.

00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:06.651
I've heard one expert say that trafficking
happens where need meets greed.

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:09.793
I'd like to add one more element to that.

00:10:10.772 --> 00:10:14.927
Trafficking happens in sectors where
workers are excluded from protections,

00:10:14.951 --> 00:10:17.239
and denied the right to organize.

00:10:17.874 --> 00:10:20.035
Trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum.

00:10:20.538 --> 00:10:24.045
It happens in systematically
degraded work environments.

00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:26.400
You might be thinking,

00:10:26.424 --> 00:10:29.525
oh, she's talking about failed states,
or war-torn states, or --

00:10:29.549 --> 00:10:31.652
I'm actually talking
about the United States.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.270
Let me tell you what that looks like.

00:10:35.342 --> 00:10:38.835
I spent many months researching
a trafficking case called Global Horizons,

00:10:38.859 --> 00:10:41.185
involving hundreds of Thai farm workers.

00:10:41.209 --> 00:10:44.801
They were sent all over the States,
to work in Hawaii pineapple plantations,

00:10:44.825 --> 00:10:47.926
and Washington apple orchards,
and anywhere the work was needed.

00:10:48.555 --> 00:10:52.879
They were promised three years
of solid agricultural work.

00:10:52.903 --> 00:10:54.823
So they made a calculated risk.

00:10:54.847 --> 00:10:57.929
They sold their land, they sold
their wives' jewelry,

00:10:57.953 --> 00:11:02.099
to make thousands in recruitment fees
for this company, Global Horizons.

00:11:02.776 --> 00:11:04.604
But once they were brought over,

00:11:04.628 --> 00:11:06.653
their passports were confiscated.

00:11:06.677 --> 00:11:09.298
Some of the men were beaten
and held at gunpoint.

00:11:09.791 --> 00:11:12.413
They worked so hard
they fainted in the fields.

00:11:14.138 --> 00:11:16.362
This case hit me so hard.

00:11:17.572 --> 00:11:19.653
After I came back home,

00:11:19.677 --> 00:11:23.702
I was wandering through the grocery store,
and I froze in the produce department.

00:11:24.688 --> 00:11:28.084
I was remembering the over-the-top meals
the Global Horizons survivors

00:11:28.108 --> 00:11:30.935
would make for me every time
I showed up to interview them.

00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:37.423
They finished one meal with this plate
of perfect, long-stemmed strawberries,

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.960
and as they handed them to me, they said,

00:11:39.984 --> 00:11:43.216
"Aren't these the kind of strawberries
you eat with somebody special

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.397
in the States?

00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:46.901
And don't they taste so much better

00:11:46.925 --> 00:11:50.513
when you know the people
whose hands picked them for you?"

00:11:54.016 --> 00:11:58.247
As I stood in that grocery store weeks
later, I realized I had no idea

00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.447
of who to thank for this plenty,

00:12:00.471 --> 00:12:02.471
and no idea of how
they were being treated.

00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:08.058
So, like the journalist I am, I started
digging into the agricultural sector.

00:12:08.423 --> 00:12:12.738
And I found there are too many fields,
and too few labor inspectors.

00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:15.969
I found multiple layers
of plausible deniability

00:12:15.993 --> 00:12:20.053
between grower and distributor
and processor, and God knows who else.

00:12:20.988 --> 00:12:23.854
The Global Horizons survivors had been
brought to the States

00:12:23.878 --> 00:12:26.117
on a temporary guest worker program.

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:30.612
That guest worker program
ties a person's legal status

00:12:30.636 --> 00:12:32.278
to his or her employer,

00:12:32.302 --> 00:12:35.961
and denies that worker
the right to organize.

00:12:36.717 --> 00:12:40.969
Mind you, none of what I am describing
about this agricultural sector

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:44.515
or the guest worker program
is actually human trafficking.

00:12:45.234 --> 00:12:49.138
It is merely what we find
legally tolerable.

00:12:50.305 --> 00:12:53.631
And I would argue this is
fertile ground for exploitation.

00:12:54.187 --> 00:12:58.198
And all of this had been hidden to me,
before I had tried to understand it.

00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:02.449
I wasn't the only person
grappling with these issues.

00:13:03.045 --> 00:13:05.209
Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay,

00:13:05.233 --> 00:13:09.073
is one of the biggest anti-trafficking
philanthropists in the world.

00:13:09.544 --> 00:13:14.685
And even he wound up accidentally
investing nearly 10 million dollars

00:13:14.709 --> 00:13:18.369
in the pineapple plantation cited
as having the worst working conditions

00:13:18.393 --> 00:13:20.997
in that Global Horizons case.

00:13:22.464 --> 00:13:26.434
When he found out, he and his wife
were shocked and horrified,

00:13:26.458 --> 00:13:29.051
and they wound up writing
an op-ed for a newspaper,

00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:32.974
saying that it was up to all of us
to learn everything we can

00:13:32.998 --> 00:13:36.808
about the labor and supply chains
of the products that we support.

00:13:37.909 --> 00:13:39.601
I totally agree.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.773
What would happen
if each one of us decided

00:13:43.797 --> 00:13:46.354
that we are no longer going
to support companies

00:13:46.378 --> 00:13:49.944
if they don't eliminate exploitation
from their labor and supply chains?

00:13:50.326 --> 00:13:53.027
If we demanded laws calling for the same?

00:13:53.729 --> 00:13:56.627
If all the CEOs out there decided

00:13:56.651 --> 00:14:00.153
that they were going to go through
their businesses and say, "no more"?

00:14:01.046 --> 00:14:03.839
If we ended recruitment fees
for migrant workers?

00:14:04.574 --> 00:14:07.685
If we decided that guest workers
should have the right to organize

00:14:07.709 --> 00:14:09.225
without fear of retaliation?

00:14:09.968 --> 00:14:13.610
These would be decisions heard
around the world.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.973
This isn't a matter of buying
a fair-trade peach

00:14:17.007 --> 00:14:21.164
and calling it a day, buying
a guilt-free zone with your money.

00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:22.766
That's not how it works.

00:14:23.402 --> 00:14:27.428
This is the decision to change
a system that is broken,

00:14:27.452 --> 00:14:30.963
and that we have unwittingly but willingly

00:14:30.987 --> 00:14:35.111
allowed ourselves to profit from
and benefit from for too long.

00:14:37.435 --> 00:14:41.355
We often dwell on human trafficking
survivors' victimization.

00:14:42.303 --> 00:14:44.666
But that is not my experience of them.

00:14:45.725 --> 00:14:48.082
Over all the years that I've
been talking to them,

00:14:48.106 --> 00:14:51.426
they have taught me that we are
more than our worst days.

00:14:51.941 --> 00:14:55.211
Each one of us is more
than what we have lived through.

00:14:56.183 --> 00:14:58.261
Especially trafficking survivors.

00:14:58.746 --> 00:15:02.369
These people were the most resourceful
and resilient and responsible

00:15:02.393 --> 00:15:03.552
in their communities.

00:15:04.022 --> 00:15:06.676
They were the people that you
would take a gamble on.

00:15:07.084 --> 00:15:10.266
You'd say, I'm gong to sell my rings,
because I have the chance

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.491
to send you off to a better future.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.516
They were the emissaries of hope.

00:15:17.371 --> 00:15:20.349
These survivors don't need saving.

00:15:20.731 --> 00:15:23.775
They need solidarity,
because they're behind

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:27.546
some of the most exciting
social justice movements out there today.

00:15:28.766 --> 00:15:31.703
The nannies and housekeepers
who marched with their families

00:15:31.727 --> 00:15:33.627
and their employers' families --

00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:36.569
their activism got us
an international treaty

00:15:36.593 --> 00:15:38.479
on domestic workers' rights.

00:15:39.284 --> 00:15:43.279
The Nepali women who were trafficked
into the sex trade --

00:15:43.303 --> 00:15:45.050
they came together, and they decided

00:15:45.074 --> 00:15:48.671
that they were going to make the world's
first anti-trafficking organization

00:15:48.695 --> 00:15:52.271
actually headed and run
by trafficking survivors themselves.

00:15:53.681 --> 00:15:56.459
These Indian shipyard workers
were trafficked

00:15:56.483 --> 00:15:59.174
to do post-Hurricane Katrina
reconstruction.

00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:03.315
They were threatened with deportation,
but they broke out of their work compound

00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:06.718
and they marched from New Orleans
to Washington, D.C.,

00:16:06.742 --> 00:16:08.981
to protest labor exploitation.

00:16:09.778 --> 00:16:13.293
They cofounded an organization called
the National Guest Worker Alliance,

00:16:13.317 --> 00:16:18.001
and through this organization,
they have wound up helping other workers

00:16:18.025 --> 00:16:22.423
bring to light exploitation
and abuses in supply chains

00:16:22.447 --> 00:16:24.115
in Walmart and Hershey's factories.

00:16:24.139 --> 00:16:28.320
And although the Department
of Justice declined to take their case,

00:16:28.344 --> 00:16:32.586
a team of civil rights lawyers won
the first of a dozen civil suits

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.516
this February, and got
their clients 14 million dollars.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.517
These survivors are fighting
for people they don't even know yet,

00:16:42.541 --> 00:16:46.892
other workers, and for the possibility
of a just world for all of us.

00:16:47.626 --> 00:16:49.626
This is our chance to do the same.

00:16:50.716 --> 00:16:52.899
This is our chance to make the decision

00:16:52.923 --> 00:16:56.756
that tells us who we are,
as a people and as a society;

00:16:56.778 --> 00:16:59.625
that our prosperity is no
longer prosperity,

00:16:59.649 --> 00:17:03.522
as long as it is pinned
to other people's pain;

00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:07.165
that our lives are
inextricably woven together;

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:11.081
and that we have the power
to make a different choice.

00:17:14.217 --> 00:17:19.020
I was so reluctant to share
my story of my auntie with you.

00:17:19.976 --> 00:17:22.953
Before I started this TED process
and climbed up on this stage,

00:17:22.977 --> 00:17:25.953
I had told literally a handful
of people about it,

00:17:25.977 --> 00:17:27.929
because, like many a journalist,

00:17:27.953 --> 00:17:30.843
I am far more interested in learning
about your stories

00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:34.085
than sharing much,
if anything, about my own.

00:17:35.273 --> 00:17:38.218
I also haven't done my journalistic
due diligence on this.

00:17:38.242 --> 00:17:40.646
I haven't issued my mountains
of document requests,

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.907
and interviewed everyone and their mother,

00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:44.931
and I haven't found my auntie yet.

00:17:45.241 --> 00:17:50.069
I don't know her story
of what happened, and of her life now.

00:17:50.781 --> 00:17:54.161
The story as I've told it to you
is messy and unfinished.

00:17:54.914 --> 00:17:59.766
But I think it mirrors the messy
and unfinished situation we're all in,

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.790
when it comes to human trafficking.

00:18:02.523 --> 00:18:05.237
We are all implicated in this problem.

00:18:06.291 --> 00:18:10.778
But that means we are all
also part of its solution.

00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:16.355
Figuring out how to build a more
just world is our work to do,

00:18:16.379 --> 00:18:18.280
and our story to tell.

00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:21.677
So let us tell it the way
we should have done,

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:23.264
from the very beginning.

00:18:23.801 --> 00:18:26.557
Let us tell this story together.

00:18:27.518 --> 00:18:28.827
Thank you so much.

00:18:28.851 --> 00:18:35.700
(Applause)
