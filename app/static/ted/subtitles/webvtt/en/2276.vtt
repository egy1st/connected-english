00:00:00.683 --> 00:00:05.083
It was November 1, 2002,

00:00:06.208 --> 00:00:08.958
my first day as a principal,

00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:14.469
but hardly my first day
in the school district of Philadelphia.

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:18.176
I graduated from
Philadelphia public schools,

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:22.375
and I went on to teach
special education for 20 years

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:25.792
in a low-income, low-performing school

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:27.783
in North Philadelphia,

00:00:28.292 --> 00:00:29.875
where crime is rampant

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.625
and deep poverty is
among the highest in the nation.

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:38.559
Shortly after I walked into my new school,

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:42.500
a huge fight broke out among the girls.

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:47.025
After things were quickly under control,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.518
I immediately called a meeting

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:52.809
in the school's auditorium

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:56.768
to introduce myself
as the school's new principal.

00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:59.708
(Applause)

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:02.333
I walked in angry,

00:01:03.154 --> 00:01:04.522
a little nervous --

00:01:04.546 --> 00:01:05.684
(Laughter) --

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:07.458
but I was determined

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:10.292
to set the tone for my new students.

00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:14.917
I started listing as forcefully as I could

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.600
my expectations for their behavior

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:22.083
and my expectations
for what they would learn in school.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:24.125
When, all of a sudden,

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:28.042
a girl way in the back of the auditorium,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.042
she stood up

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:32.625
and she said, "Miss!

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:34.792
Miss!"

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.500
When our eyes locked, she said,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.868
"Why do you keep calling this a school?

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:47.375
This is not a school."

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:50.417
In one outburst,

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:54.583
Ashley had expressed what I felt

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:57.917
and never quite was able to articulate

00:01:58.292 --> 00:02:02.893
about my own experience
when I attended a low-performing school

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:06.750
in the same neighborhood,
many, many, many years earlier.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.625
That school was definitely not a school.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.875
Fast forwarding a decade later to 2012,

00:02:19.083 --> 00:02:23.625
I was entering my third
low-performing school as principal.

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:29.625
I was to be Strawberry Mansion's
fourth principal in four years.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.125
It was labeled "low-performing
and persistently dangerous"

00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:38.601
due to its low test scores

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.351
and high number of weapons,

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:43.917
drugs, assaults and arrests.

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:49.726
Shortly as I approached the door
of my new school

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.518
and attempted to enter,

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:54.750
and found the door locked with chains,

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:58.851
I could hear Ashley's voice in my ears

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:01.833
going, "Miss! Miss!

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:04.958
This is not a school."

00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:08.958
The halls were dim and dark
from poor lighting.

00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:13.018
There were tons of piles
of broken old furniture

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:15.309
and desks in the classrooms,

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:19.833
and there were thousands
of unused materials and resources.

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:23.042
This was not a school.

00:03:24.292 --> 00:03:26.083
As the year progressed,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.125
I noticed that the classrooms
were nearly empty.

00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.042
The students were just scared:

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.750
scared to sit in rows in fear
that something would happen;

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:44.333
scared because they were often teased
in the cafeteria for eating free food.

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:49.417
They were scared from all the fighting
and all the bullying.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:53.250
This was not a school.

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:58.101
And then, there were the teachers,

00:03:58.125 --> 00:04:02.375
who were incredibly afraid
for their own safety,

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:08.476
so they had low expectations
for the students and themselves,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.809
and they were totally
unaware of their role

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.042
in the destruction
of the school's culture.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.541
This was the most troubling of all.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.625
You see, Ashley was right,

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.708
and not just about her school.

00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:27.809
For far too many schools,

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.893
for kids who live in poverty,

00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:32.750
their schools are really
not schools at all.

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:35.292
But this can change.

00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:40.625
Let me tell you how it's being done
at Strawberry Mansion High School.

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:45.375
Anybody who's ever worked
with me will tell you

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:47.958
I am known for my slogans.

00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:49.625
(Laughter)

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.530
So today, I am going to use three

00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:56.887
that have been paramount
in our quest for change.

00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:59.667
My first slogan is:

00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:02.833
if you're going to lead, lead.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.870
I always believed

00:05:05.894 --> 00:05:09.768
that what happens in a school
and what does not happen in a school

00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:11.250
is up to the principal.

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.417
I am the principal,

00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:17.458
and having that title required me to lead.

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:20.822
I was not going to stay in my office,

00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:23.667
I was not going to delegate my work,

00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:27.136
and I was not going to be afraid
to address anything

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.060
that was not good for children,

00:05:29.084 --> 00:05:32.058
whether that made me liked or not.

00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:34.941
I am a leader,

00:05:34.965 --> 00:05:38.063
so I know I cannot do anything alone.

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:41.451
So, I assembled
a top-notch leadership team

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:44.559
who believed in the possibility
of all the children,

00:05:44.583 --> 00:05:48.432
and together, we tackled the small things,

00:05:48.456 --> 00:05:53.059
like resetting every single
locker combination by hand

00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:55.997
so that every student
could have a secure locker.

00:05:56.583 --> 00:06:00.015
We decorated every
bulletin board in that building

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.892
with bright, colorful,
and positive messages.

00:06:03.428 --> 00:06:06.555
We took the chains off
the front doors of the school.

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:08.674
We got the lightbulbs replaced,

00:06:08.698 --> 00:06:11.854
and we cleaned
every classroom to its core,

00:06:11.878 --> 00:06:16.353
recycling every, every textbook
that was not needed,

00:06:16.377 --> 00:06:20.307
and discarded thousands
of old materials and furniture.

00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:23.568
We used two dumpsters per day.

00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:27.432
And, of course, of course,

00:06:27.456 --> 00:06:29.392
we tackled the big stuff,

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:33.779
like rehauling the entire school budget

00:06:33.803 --> 00:06:38.658
so that we can reallocate funds
to have more teachers and support staff.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:45.268
We rebuilt the entire
school day schedule from scratch

00:06:45.292 --> 00:06:49.171
to add a variety of start and end times,

00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:52.347
remediation, honors courses,

00:06:52.792 --> 00:06:56.392
extracurricular activities,
and counseling,

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.249
all during the school day.

00:06:59.717 --> 00:07:01.650
All during the school day.

00:07:04.217 --> 00:07:07.208
We created a deployment plan

00:07:08.473 --> 00:07:14.121
that specified where every single
support person and police officer would be

00:07:14.145 --> 00:07:15.549
every minute of the day,

00:07:15.573 --> 00:07:19.476
and we monitored
at every second of the day,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.275
and, our best invention ever,

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:25.933
we devised a schoolwide
discipline program

00:07:25.957 --> 00:07:27.692
titled "Non-negotiables."

00:07:28.137 --> 00:07:29.841
It was a behavior system --

00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:36.775
designed to promote
positive behavior at all times.

00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:38.317
The results?

00:07:39.085 --> 00:07:43.213
Strawberry Mansion was removed
from the Persistently Dangerous List

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:45.676
our first year after being --

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.613
(Applause) --

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.215
after being on the Persistently
Dangerous List for five consecutive years.

00:07:56.732 --> 00:08:00.732
Leaders make the impossible possible.

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:03.993
That brings me to my second slogan:

00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:07.467
So what? Now what?

00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:08.573
(Laughter)

00:08:08.597 --> 00:08:12.875
(Applause)

00:08:13.483 --> 00:08:15.317
When we looked at the data,

00:08:15.718 --> 00:08:17.788
and we met with the staff,

00:08:17.812 --> 00:08:19.726
there were many excuses

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.683
for why Strawberry Mansion was
low-performing and persistently dangerous.

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:28.996
They said that only 68 percent of the kids
come to school on a regular basis,

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.049
100 percent of them live in poverty,

00:08:32.587 --> 00:08:35.506
only one percent
of the parents participate,

00:08:36.173 --> 00:08:37.804
many of the children

00:08:37.828 --> 00:08:41.376
come from incarceration
and single-parent homes,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.704
39 percent of the students
have special needs,

00:08:45.728 --> 00:08:48.140
and the state data revealed

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:52.993
that six percent of the students
were proficient in algebra,

00:08:53.017 --> 00:08:55.993
and 10 were proficient in literature.

00:08:58.817 --> 00:09:02.743
After they got through
telling us all the stories

00:09:02.767 --> 00:09:06.726
of how awful the conditions
and the children were,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.442
I looked at them,

00:09:09.162 --> 00:09:12.520
and I said, "So what. Now what?

00:09:13.088 --> 00:09:14.891
What are we gonna do about it?"

00:09:14.915 --> 00:09:17.874
(Applause)

00:09:20.654 --> 00:09:25.908
Eliminating excuses at every turn
became my primary responsibility.

00:09:26.552 --> 00:09:29.614
We addressed every one of those excuses

00:09:29.614 --> 00:09:32.194
through a mandatory
professional development,

00:09:32.194 --> 00:09:37.150
paving the way for intense focus
on teaching and learning.

00:09:38.037 --> 00:09:40.156
After many observations,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.875
what we determined was
that teachers knew what to teach

00:09:45.462 --> 00:09:48.226
but they did not know how to teach

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.217
so many children
with so many vast abilities.

00:09:51.798 --> 00:09:56.872
So, we developed a lesson
delivery model for instruction

00:09:56.896 --> 00:10:00.636
that focused on small group instruction,

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.454
making it possible for all the students
to get their individual needs met

00:10:05.478 --> 00:10:06.779
in the classroom.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.383
The results?

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:13.802
After one year, state data revealed

00:10:13.826 --> 00:10:18.137
that our scores have grown
by 171 percent in Algebra

00:10:18.161 --> 00:10:20.782
and 107 percent in literature.

00:10:20.806 --> 00:10:23.767
(Applause)

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.582
We have a very long way to go,

00:10:28.049 --> 00:10:29.983
a very long way to go,

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:36.991
but we now approach every obstacle
with a "So What. Now What?" attitude.

00:10:38.377 --> 00:10:42.462
And that brings me
to my third and final slogan.

00:10:42.486 --> 00:10:44.136
(Laughter)

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.989
If nobody told you they loved you today,

00:10:48.678 --> 00:10:52.285
you remember I do, and I always will.

00:10:53.079 --> 00:10:54.875
My students have problems:

00:10:55.875 --> 00:11:00.424
social, emotional and economic problems

00:11:00.448 --> 00:11:02.140
you could never imagine.

00:11:03.056 --> 00:11:05.394
Some of them are parents themselves,

00:11:05.418 --> 00:11:08.240
and some are completely alone.

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:12.893
If someone asked me my real secret

00:11:12.917 --> 00:11:16.843
for how I truly keep
Strawberry Mansion moving forward,

00:11:17.405 --> 00:11:20.538
I would have to say
that I love my students

00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:23.403
and I believe in their possibilities

00:11:23.427 --> 00:11:24.953
unconditionally.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.637
When I look at them,

00:11:28.235 --> 00:11:31.007
I can only see what they can become,

00:11:31.869 --> 00:11:35.564
and that is because I am one of them.

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:39.392
I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too.

00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:45.378
I know what it feels like
to go to a school that's not a school.

00:11:46.184 --> 00:11:49.434
I know what it feels like to wonder

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:53.108
if there's ever going to be
any way out of poverty.

00:11:54.092 --> 00:11:56.946
But because of my amazing mother,

00:11:58.496 --> 00:12:01.562
I got the ability to dream

00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:04.168
despite the poverty that surrounded me.

00:12:05.161 --> 00:12:06.359
So --

00:12:06.383 --> 00:12:08.831
(Applause) --

00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:13.948
if I'm going to push my students

00:12:13.972 --> 00:12:16.745
toward their dream
and their purpose in life,

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:19.377
I've got to get to know who they are.

00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:22.894
So I have to spend time with them,

00:12:22.918 --> 00:12:25.318
so I manage the lunchroom every day.

00:12:25.342 --> 00:12:26.631
(Laughter)

00:12:26.655 --> 00:12:28.167
And while I'm there,

00:12:28.896 --> 00:12:32.914
I talk to them
about deeply personal things,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.913
and when it's their birthday,

00:12:35.937 --> 00:12:37.866
I sing "Happy Birthday"

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.036
even though I cannot sing at all.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.092
(Laughter)

00:12:42.116 --> 00:12:43.840
I often ask them,

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:47.797
"Why do you want me to sing
when I cannot sing at all?"

00:12:47.821 --> 00:12:49.659
(Laughter)

00:12:49.683 --> 00:12:51.867
And they respond by saying,

00:12:52.284 --> 00:12:54.660
"Because we like feeling special."

00:12:56.259 --> 00:12:59.062
We hold monthly town hall meetings

00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:02.541
to listen to their concerns,

00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:06.326
to find out what is on their minds.

00:13:06.784 --> 00:13:11.817
They ask us questions like,
"Why do we have to follow rules?"

00:13:12.255 --> 00:13:14.850
"Why are there so many consequences?"

00:13:15.168 --> 00:13:18.135
"Why can't we just do what we want to do?"

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:20.390
(Laughter)

00:13:20.414 --> 00:13:24.175
They ask, and I answer
each question honestly,

00:13:24.932 --> 00:13:30.907
and this exchange in listening
helps to clear up any misconceptions.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.392
Every moment is a teachable moment.

00:13:36.965 --> 00:13:38.175
My reward,

00:13:39.359 --> 00:13:40.525
my reward

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:47.258
for being non-negotiable
in my rules and consequences

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:49.746
is their earned respect.

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:51.967
I insist on it,

00:13:52.878 --> 00:13:57.064
and because of this,
we can accomplish things together.

00:13:57.952 --> 00:14:01.567
They are clear about
my expectations for them,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.153
and I repeat those expectations
every day over the P.A. system.

00:14:07.656 --> 00:14:09.269
I remind them --

00:14:09.293 --> 00:14:11.509
(Laughter)

00:14:11.533 --> 00:14:15.166
I remind them of those core values

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.818
of focus, tradition, excellence,

00:14:20.172 --> 00:14:23.109
integrity and perseverance,

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:25.631
and I remind them every day

00:14:25.655 --> 00:14:29.447
how education can truly
change their lives.

00:14:30.216 --> 00:14:33.054
And I end every announcement the same:

00:14:33.414 --> 00:14:37.267
"If nobody told you they loved you today,

00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:39.032
you remember I do,

00:14:39.056 --> 00:14:41.026
and I always will."

00:14:42.076 --> 00:14:44.017
Ashley's words

00:14:44.893 --> 00:14:47.763
of "Miss, Miss,

00:14:48.224 --> 00:14:50.740
this is not a school,"

00:14:51.064 --> 00:14:53.646
is forever etched in my mind.

00:14:54.354 --> 00:14:59.782
If we are truly going
to make real progress

00:14:59.806 --> 00:15:01.774
in addressing poverty,

00:15:01.798 --> 00:15:03.942
then we have to make sure

00:15:04.442 --> 00:15:08.631
that every school
that serves children in poverty

00:15:08.655 --> 00:15:11.260
is a real school,

00:15:11.284 --> 00:15:13.539
a school, a school --

00:15:13.563 --> 00:15:16.517
(Applause) --

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:21.240
a school that provides them with knowledge

00:15:21.264 --> 00:15:25.392
and mental training
to navigate the world around them.

00:15:26.112 --> 00:15:28.758
I do not know all the answers,

00:15:29.458 --> 00:15:35.075
but what I do know is for those
of us who are privileged

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:41.018
and have the responsibility of leading
a school that serves children in poverty,

00:15:41.042 --> 00:15:43.268
we must truly lead,

00:15:43.292 --> 00:15:46.917
and when we are faced
with unbelievable challenges,

00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:52.726
we must stop and ask ourselves,
"So what. Now what?

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.406
What are we going to do about it?"

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.549
And as we lead,

00:15:58.063 --> 00:15:59.968
we must never forget

00:16:00.677 --> 00:16:03.893
that every single one of our students

00:16:03.917 --> 00:16:05.520
is just a child,

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:10.942
often scared by what the world
tells them they should be,

00:16:11.797 --> 00:16:17.782
and no matter what the rest
of the world tells them they should be,

00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:21.414
we should always provide them with hope,

00:16:21.438 --> 00:16:23.984
our undivided attention,

00:16:24.656 --> 00:16:27.782
unwavering belief in their potential,

00:16:27.806 --> 00:16:29.997
consistent expectations,

00:16:30.303 --> 00:16:32.739
and we must tell them often,

00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:36.693
if nobody told them they loved them today,

00:16:36.717 --> 00:16:39.538
remember we do, and we always will.

00:16:39.844 --> 00:16:41.057
Thank you.

00:16:41.081 --> 00:16:44.164
(Applause)

00:16:52.058 --> 00:16:53.408
Thank you, Jesus.
