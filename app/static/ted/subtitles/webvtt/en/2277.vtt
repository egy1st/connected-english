00:00:00.835 --> 00:00:02.901
I love a great mystery,

00:00:02.901 --> 00:00:07.313
and I'm fascinated by the greatest
unsolved mystery in science,

00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:09.271
perhaps because it's personal.

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:11.539
It's about who we are,

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.656
and I can't help but be curious.

00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:16.275
The mystery is this:

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:19.710
What is the relationship
between your brain

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.221
and your conscious experiences,

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.891
such as your experience
of the taste of chocolate

00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:25.665
or the feeling of velvet?

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:28.389
Now, this mystery is not new.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.598
In 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote,

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:37.892
"How it is that anything so remarkable
as a state of consciousness comes about

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:41.259
as the result of irritating nervous tissue

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:43.325
is just as unaccountable

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:47.378
as the appearance of the genie
when Aladdin rubbed his lamp."

00:00:49.268 --> 00:00:51.545
Now, Huxley knew that brain activity

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:54.819
and conscious experiences are correlated,

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:56.978
but he didn't know why.

00:00:56.978 --> 00:01:00.299
To the science of his day,
it was a mystery.

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.435
In the years since Huxley,

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:05.801
science has learned a lot
about brain activity,

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:07.822
but the relationship
between brain activity

00:01:07.822 --> 00:01:10.910
and conscious experiences
is still a mystery.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.555
Why? Why have we made so little progress?

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:19.414
Well, some experts think
that we can't solve this problem

00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:23.213
because we lack the necessary
concepts and intelligence.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:27.952
We don't expect monkeys to solve
problems in quantum mechanics,

00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:32.117
and as it happens, we can't expect
our species to solve this problem either.

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:35.661
Well, I disagree. I'm more optimistic.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:38.703
I think we've simply
made a false assumption.

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:42.209
Once we fix it, we just
might solve this problem.

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.626
Today, I'd like tell you
what that assumption is,

00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:47.384
why it's false, and how to fix it.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.568
Let's begin with a question:

00:01:49.778 --> 00:01:52.866
Do we see reality as it is?

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.561
I open my eyes

00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:59.498
and I have an experience that I describe
as a red tomato a meter away.

00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:03.849
As a result, I come to believe
that in reality,

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.491
there's a red tomato a meter away.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:11.615
I then close my eyes, and my experience
changes to a gray field,

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:17.591
but is it still the case that in reality,
there's a red tomato a meter away?

00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:21.913
I think so, but could I be wrong?

00:02:21.913 --> 00:02:26.511
Could I be misinterpreting
the nature of my perceptions?

00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:30.551
We have misinterpreted
our perceptions before.

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:34.010
We used to think the Earth is flat,
because it looks that way.

00:02:34.707 --> 00:02:37.586
Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong.

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:41.598
Then we thought that the Earth
is the unmoving center of the Universe,

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:43.506
again because it looks that way.

00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:49.312
Copernicus and Galileo discovered,
again, that we were wrong.

00:02:49.312 --> 00:02:53.400
Galileo then wondered if we might
be misinterpreting our experiences

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.908
in other ways.

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:59.917
He wrote: "I think that tastes,
odors, colors, and so on

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:01.921
reside in consciousness.

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:08.043
Hence if the living creature were removed,
all these qualities would be annihilated."

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.794
Now, that's a stunning claim.

00:03:11.184 --> 00:03:12.995
Could Galileo be right?

00:03:12.995 --> 00:03:17.593
Could we really be misinterpreting
our experiences that badly?

00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:20.154
What does modern science
have to say about this?

00:03:20.704 --> 00:03:25.928
Well, neuroscientists tell us
that about a third of the brain's cortex

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:27.786
is engaged in vision.

00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:31.292
When you simply open your eyes
and look about this room,

00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:35.564
billions of neurons
and trillions of synapses are engaged.

00:03:35.564 --> 00:03:37.172
Now, this is a bit surprising,

00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:39.813
because to the extent that
we think about vision at all,

00:03:39.813 --> 00:03:42.650
we think of it as like a camera.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.590
It just takes a picture
of objective reality as it is.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.290
Now, there is a part of vision
that's like a camera:

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.929
the eye has a lens that focuses
an image on the back of the eye

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:58.319
where there are 130 million
photoreceptors,

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.219
so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.702
But that doesn't explain
the billions of neurons

00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:09.324
and trillions of synapses
that are engaged in vision.

00:04:09.324 --> 00:04:11.623
What are these neurons up to?

00:04:11.623 --> 00:04:15.830
Well, neuroscientists tell us
that they are creating, in real time,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.160
all the shapes, objects, colors,
and motions that we see.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.651
It feels like we're just taking a snapshot
of this room the way it is,

00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:27.226
but in fact, we're constructing
everything that we see.

00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:30.407
We don't construct
the whole world at once.

00:04:30.407 --> 00:04:33.172
We construct what we need in the moment.

00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:36.909
Now, there are many demonstrations
that are quite compelling

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.720
that we construct what we see.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.763
I'll just show you two.

00:04:40.763 --> 00:04:46.529
In this example, you see some red discs
with bits cut out of them,

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.470
but if I just rotate
the disks a little bit,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.207
suddenly, you see a 3D cube
pop out of the screen.

00:04:54.207 --> 00:04:57.040
Now, the screen of course is flat,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.640
so the three-dimensional cube
that you're experiencing

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.617
must be your construction.

00:05:03.397 --> 00:05:05.310
In this next example,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.534
you see glowing blue bars
with pretty sharp edges

00:05:09.534 --> 00:05:12.718
moving across a field of dots.

00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:16.845
In fact, no dots move.

00:05:16.845 --> 00:05:21.466
All I'm doing from frame to frame
is changing the colors of dots

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:23.927
from blue to black or black to blue.

00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:25.761
But when I do this quickly,

00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:29.476
your visual system creates
the glowing blue bars

00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:32.147
with the sharp edges and the motion.

00:05:32.147 --> 00:05:34.817
There are many more examples,
but these are just two

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:37.580
that you construct what you see.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.955
But neuroscientists go further.

00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:46.496
They say that we reconstruct reality.

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:50.722
So, when I have an experience
that I describe as a red tomato,

00:05:50.722 --> 00:05:54.855
that experience is actually
an accurate reconstruction

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:56.970
of the properties of a real red tomato

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.265
that would exist
even if I weren't looking.

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:04.816
Now, why would neuroscientists
say that we don't just construct,

00:06:04.816 --> 00:06:06.696
we reconstruct?

00:06:06.696 --> 00:06:09.227
Well, the standard argument given

00:06:09.227 --> 00:06:11.781
is usually an evolutionary one.

00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:15.380
Those of our ancestors
who saw more accurately

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.233
had a competitive advantage compared
to those who saw less accurately,

00:06:20.233 --> 00:06:22.989
and therefore they were more likely
to pass on their genes.

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:26.380
We are the offspring of those
who saw more accurately,

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.149
and so we can be confident that,
in the normal case,

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:31.680
our perceptions are accurate.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.375
You see this in the standard textbooks.

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:37.369
One textbook says, for example,

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:39.340
"Evolutionarily speaking,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.383
vision is useful precisely
because it is so accurate."

00:06:43.383 --> 00:06:48.181
So the idea is that accurate perceptions
are fitter perceptions.

00:06:48.181 --> 00:06:50.325
They give you a survival advantage.

00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:52.240
Now, is this correct?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.899
Is this the right interpretation
of evolutionary theory?

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:58.280
Well, let's first look at a couple
of examples in nature.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.238
The Australian jewel beetle

00:07:01.238 --> 00:07:04.349
is dimpled, glossy and brown.

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.694
The female is flightless.

00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:10.711
The male flies, looking,
of course, for a hot female.

00:07:10.711 --> 00:07:14.659
When he finds one, he alights and mates.

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:17.130
There's another species in the outback,

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.464
Homo sapiens.

00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:21.531
The male of this species
has a massive brain

00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:25.479
that he uses to hunt for cold beer.

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:27.168
(Laughter)

00:07:27.168 --> 00:07:29.542
And when he finds one, he drains it,

00:07:29.542 --> 00:07:32.932
and sometimes throws the bottle
into the outback.

00:07:32.932 --> 00:07:37.180
Now, as it happens, these bottles
are dimpled, glossy,

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.320
and just the right shade of brown
to tickle the fancy of these beetles.

00:07:42.772 --> 00:07:46.235
The males swarm all over
the bottles trying to mate.

00:07:47.582 --> 00:07:50.369
They lose all interest
in the real females.

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:54.572
Classic case of the male
leaving the female for the bottle.

00:07:54.572 --> 00:07:57.519
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:59.402 --> 00:08:01.773
The species almost went extinct.

00:08:02.443 --> 00:08:06.752
Australia had to change its bottles
to save its beetles.

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:09.752
(Laughter)

00:08:09.752 --> 00:08:13.960
Now, the males had successfully
found females for thousands,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.398
perhaps millions of years.

00:08:16.398 --> 00:08:20.832
It looked like they saw reality
as it is, but apparently not.

00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:23.689
Evolution had given them a hack.

00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:28.425
A female is anything dimpled,
glossy and brown,

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.701
the bigger the better.

00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:32.535
(Laughter)

00:08:32.535 --> 00:08:37.375
Even when crawling all over the bottle,
the male couldn't discover his mistake.

00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:41.590
Now, you might say, beetles, sure,
they're very simple creatures,

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.448
but surely not mammals.

00:08:43.448 --> 00:08:46.165
Mammals don't rely on tricks.

00:08:46.165 --> 00:08:52.178
Well, I won't dwell on this,
but you get the idea. (Laughter)

00:08:52.178 --> 00:08:55.336
So this raises an important
technical question:

00:08:55.336 --> 00:09:01.327
Does natural selection really favor
seeing reality as it is?

00:09:01.877 --> 00:09:05.413
Fortunately, we don't have
to wave our hands and guess;

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:08.594
evolution is a mathematically
precise theory.

00:09:08.594 --> 00:09:12.147
We can use the equations of evolution
to check this out.

00:09:12.147 --> 00:09:16.300
We can have various organisms
in artificial worlds compete

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.253
and see which survive and which thrive,

00:09:18.253 --> 00:09:21.806
which sensory systems are more fit.

00:09:21.806 --> 00:09:25.891
A key notion in those
equations is fitness.

00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:28.586
Consider this steak:

00:09:29.956 --> 00:09:32.918
What does this steak do
for the fitness of an animal?

00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:39.454
Well, for a hungry lion looking to eat,
it enhances fitness.

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:44.773
For a well-fed lion looking to mate,
it doesn't enhance fitness.

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:49.924
And for a rabbit in any state,
it doesn't enhance fitness,

00:09:49.924 --> 00:09:54.048
so fitness does depend
on reality as it is, yes,

00:09:54.048 --> 00:09:58.236
but also on the organism,
its state and its action.

00:09:58.236 --> 00:10:01.789
Fitness is not the same thing
as reality as it is,

00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:05.272
and it's fitness,
and not reality as it is,

00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:09.451
that figures centrally
in the equations of evolution.

00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:12.642
So, in my lab,

00:10:12.642 --> 00:10:16.417
we have run hundreds of thousands
of evolutionary game simulations

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:19.482
with lots of different
randomly chosen worlds

00:10:19.482 --> 00:10:23.661
and organisms that compete
for resources in those worlds.

00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:27.980
Some of the organisms
see all of the reality,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.869
others see just part of the reality,

00:10:29.869 --> 00:10:31.974
and some see none of the reality,

00:10:31.974 --> 00:10:33.740
only fitness.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.820
Who wins?

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:42.255
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but perception of reality goes extinct.

00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:44.164
In almost every simulation,

00:10:44.164 --> 00:10:46.346
organisms that see none of reality

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:48.436
but are just tuned to fitness

00:10:48.436 --> 00:10:53.660
drive to extinction all the organisms
that perceive reality as it is.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.250
So the bottom line is, evolution
does not favor veridical,

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.906
or accurate perceptions.

00:10:59.906 --> 00:11:03.668
Those perceptions of reality go extinct.

00:11:03.668 --> 00:11:05.688
Now, this is a bit stunning.

00:11:05.688 --> 00:11:09.370
How can it be that not seeing
the world accurately

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.190
gives us a survival advantage?

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.303
That is a bit counterintuitive.

00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:15.138
But remember the jewel beetle.

00:11:15.138 --> 00:11:18.899
The jewel beetle survived
for thousands, perhaps millions of years,

00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:21.593
using simple tricks and hacks.

00:11:21.593 --> 00:11:24.770
What the equations
of evolution are telling us

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:30.413
is that all organisms, including us, 
are in the same boat as the jewel beetle.

00:11:30.413 --> 00:11:32.343
We do not see reality as it is.

00:11:32.343 --> 00:11:36.615
We're shaped with tricks
and hacks that keep us alive.

00:11:36.615 --> 00:11:38.635
Still,

00:11:38.635 --> 00:11:40.702
we need some help with our intuitions.

00:11:40.702 --> 00:11:45.485
How can not perceiving
reality as it is be useful?

00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:49.154
Well, fortunately, we have
a very helpful metaphor:

00:11:49.154 --> 00:11:51.986
the desktop interface on your computer.

00:11:51.986 --> 00:11:56.119
Consider that blue icon
for a TED Talk that you're writing.

00:11:56.119 --> 00:12:00.123
Now, the icon is blue and rectangular

00:12:00.123 --> 00:12:02.504
and in the lower right corner
of the desktop.

00:12:03.324 --> 00:12:07.510
Does that mean that the text file itself
in the computer is blue,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.955
rectangular, and in the lower
right-hand corner of the computer?

00:12:11.955 --> 00:12:13.278
Of course not.

00:12:13.278 --> 00:12:17.987
Anyone who thought that misinterprets
the purpose of the interface.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.755
It's not there to show you
the reality of the computer.

00:12:20.755 --> 00:12:23.680
In fact, it's there to hide that reality.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.555
You don't want to know about the diodes

00:12:25.555 --> 00:12:27.805
and resistors and all
the megabytes of software.

00:12:27.805 --> 00:12:30.936
If you had to deal with that,
you could never write your text file

00:12:30.936 --> 00:12:32.411
or edit your photo.

00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:37.128
So the idea is that evolution
has given us an interface

00:12:37.128 --> 00:12:41.443
that hides reality and guides
adaptive behavior.

00:12:41.443 --> 00:12:44.461
Space and time, as you
perceive them right now,

00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:46.635
are your desktop.

00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:51.372
Physical objects are simply icons
in that desktop.

00:12:52.192 --> 00:12:54.413
There's an obvious objection.

00:12:54.413 --> 00:12:58.361
Hoffman, if you think that train
coming down the track at 200 MPH

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.822
is just an icon of your desktop,

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.947
why don't you step in front of it?

00:13:02.947 --> 00:13:05.240
And after you're gone,
and your theory with you,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.554
we'll know that there's more
to that train than just an icon.

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:10.597
Well, I wouldn't step
in front of that train

00:13:10.597 --> 00:13:12.153
for the same reason

00:13:12.153 --> 00:13:16.448
that I wouldn't carelessly drag
that icon to the trash can:

00:13:16.448 --> 00:13:19.629
not because I take the icon literally --

00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:22.634
the file is not literally blue
or rectangular --

00:13:22.934 --> 00:13:25.260
but I do take it seriously.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.291
I could lose weeks of work.

00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:29.845
Similarly, evolution has shaped us

00:13:29.845 --> 00:13:34.281
with perceptual symbols
that are designed to keep us alive.

00:13:34.811 --> 00:13:37.276
We'd better take them seriously.

00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:39.481
If you see a snake, don't pick it up.

00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:43.150
If you see a cliff, don't jump off.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.726
They're designed to keep us safe,
and we should take them seriously.

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:49.417
That does not mean that we
should take them literally.

00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:51.671
That's a logical error.

00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:54.876
Another objection: There's
nothing really new here.

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:58.800
Physicists have told us for a long time
that the metal of that train looks solid

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.188
but really it's mostly empty space
with microscopic particles zipping around.

00:14:03.188 --> 00:14:04.676
There's nothing new here.

00:14:04.676 --> 00:14:06.880
Well, not exactly.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.920
It's like saying, I know that
that blue icon on the desktop

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.219
is not the reality of the computer,

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:16.678
but if I pull out my trusty
magnifying glass and look really closely,

00:14:16.678 --> 00:14:18.489
I see little pixels,

00:14:18.489 --> 00:14:20.950
and that's the reality of the computer.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.758
Well, not really -- you're still
on the desktop, and that's the point.

00:14:24.758 --> 00:14:27.754
Those microscopic particles
are still in space and time:

00:14:27.754 --> 00:14:30.145
they're still in the user interface.

00:14:30.145 --> 00:14:33.907
So I'm saying something far more radical
than those physicists.

00:14:34.727 --> 00:14:36.200
Finally, you might object,

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.759
look, we all see the train,

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:41.801
therefore none of us constructs the train.

00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:43.891
But remember this example.

00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:46.607
In this example, we all see a cube,

00:14:47.597 --> 00:14:49.690
but the screen is flat,

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.427
so the cube that you see
is the cube that you construct.

00:14:53.736 --> 00:14:55.779
We all see a cube

00:14:55.779 --> 00:15:00.638
because we all, each one of us,
constructs the cube that we see.

00:15:00.638 --> 00:15:02.698
The same is true of the train.

00:15:02.698 --> 00:15:07.180
We all see a train because
we each see the train that we construct,

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.733
and the same is true
of all physical objects.

00:15:12.343 --> 00:15:17.396
We're inclined to think that perception
is like a window on reality as it is.

00:15:17.396 --> 00:15:22.400
The theory of evolution is telling us
that this is an incorrect interpretation

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.865
of our perceptions.

00:15:25.095 --> 00:15:28.639
Instead, reality is more like a 3D desktop

00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:31.936
that's designed to hide
the complexity of the real world

00:15:31.936 --> 00:15:33.802
and guide adaptive behavior.

00:15:34.282 --> 00:15:37.210
Space as you perceive it is your desktop.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.236
Physical objects are just
the icons in that desktop.

00:15:41.456 --> 00:15:45.126
We used to think that the Earth is flat
because it looks that way.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.654
Then we thought that the Earth
is the unmoving center of reality

00:15:48.654 --> 00:15:50.378
because it looks that way.

00:15:50.378 --> 00:15:51.520
We were wrong.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.190
We had misinterpreted our perceptions.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.319
Now we believe that spacetime and objects

00:15:58.319 --> 00:16:00.933
are the nature of reality as it is.

00:16:01.453 --> 00:16:05.377
The theory of evolution is telling us
that once again, we're wrong.

00:16:05.377 --> 00:16:10.416
We're misinterpreting the content
of our perceptual experiences.

00:16:10.416 --> 00:16:12.947
There's something that exists
when you don't look,

00:16:12.947 --> 00:16:16.350
but it's not spacetime
and physical objects.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.378
It's as hard for us to let go
of spacetime and objects

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:22.861
as it is for the jewel beetle
to let go of its bottle.

00:16:22.861 --> 00:16:27.279
Why? Because we're blind
to our own blindnesses.

00:16:28.409 --> 00:16:30.756
But we have an advantage
over the jewel beetle:

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.544
our science and technology.

00:16:32.544 --> 00:16:34.935
By peering through the lens of a telescope

00:16:34.935 --> 00:16:39.571
we discovered that the Earth
is not the unmoving center of reality,

00:16:39.571 --> 00:16:42.449
and by peering through the lens
of the theory of evolution

00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:44.771
we discovered that spacetime and objects

00:16:44.771 --> 00:16:47.139
are not the nature of reality.

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:51.424
When I have a perceptual experience
that I describe as a red tomato,

00:16:51.424 --> 00:16:54.361
I am interacting with reality,

00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:59.571
but that reality is not a red tomato
and is nothing like a red tomato.

00:16:59.571 --> 00:17:04.972
Similarly, when I have an experience
that I describe as a lion or a steak,

00:17:04.972 --> 00:17:06.820
I'm interacting with reality,

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.978
but that reality is not a lion or a steak.

00:17:09.978 --> 00:17:11.998
And here's the kicker:

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:16.688
When I have a perceptual experience
that I describe as a brain, or neurons,

00:17:16.688 --> 00:17:18.778
I am interacting with reality,

00:17:18.778 --> 00:17:22.307
but that reality is not a brain or neurons

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:25.805
and is nothing like a brain or neurons.

00:17:25.805 --> 00:17:30.584
And that reality, whatever it is,

00:17:30.584 --> 00:17:34.195
is the real source of cause and effect

00:17:34.195 --> 00:17:38.227
in the world -- not brains, not neurons.

00:17:38.227 --> 00:17:40.827
Brains and neurons
have no causal powers.

00:17:40.827 --> 00:17:43.428
They cause none of our
perceptual experiences,

00:17:43.428 --> 00:17:45.216
and none of our behavior.

00:17:45.216 --> 00:17:50.592
Brains and neurons are a species-specific
set of symbols, a hack.

00:17:50.592 --> 00:17:53.273
What does this mean
for the mystery of consciousness?

00:17:53.923 --> 00:17:57.916
Well, it opens up new possibilities.

00:17:57.916 --> 00:17:59.611
For instance,

00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:06.590
perhaps reality is some vast machine
that causes our conscious experiences.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.260
I doubt this, but it's worth exploring.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:15.609
Perhaps reality is some vast,
interacting network of conscious agents,

00:18:15.609 --> 00:18:21.182
simple and complex, that cause
each other's conscious experiences.

00:18:21.182 --> 00:18:24.432
Actually, this isn't as crazy
an idea as it seems,

00:18:24.432 --> 00:18:26.052
and I'm currently exploring it.

00:18:26.592 --> 00:18:28.658
But here's the point:

00:18:28.658 --> 00:18:31.979
Once we let go of our massively intuitive

00:18:31.979 --> 00:18:35.903
but massively false assumption
about the nature of reality,

00:18:35.903 --> 00:18:40.291
it opens up new ways to think
about life's greatest mystery.

00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:45.860
I bet that reality will end up
turning out to be more fascinating

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.834
and unexpected than we've ever imagined.

00:18:49.834 --> 00:18:54.222
The theory of evolution presents us
with the ultimate dare:

00:18:54.222 --> 00:18:59.364
Dare to recognize that perception
is not about seeing truth,

00:18:59.364 --> 00:19:03.460
it's about having kids.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:08.200
And by the way, even this TED
is just in your head.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.244
Thank you very much.

00:19:10.244 --> 00:19:13.632
(Applause)

00:19:20.786 --> 00:19:24.221
Chris Anderson: If that's
really you there, thank you.

00:19:24.221 --> 00:19:27.152
So there's so much from this.

00:19:27.152 --> 00:19:30.421
I mean, first of all, some people
may just be profoundly depressed

00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:35.970
at the thought that,
if evolution does not favor reality,

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.300
I mean, doesn't that to some extent
undermine all our endeavors here,

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.984
all our ability to think
that we can think the truth,

00:19:41.984 --> 00:19:45.490
possibly even including
your own theory, if you go there?

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.944
Donald Hoffman: Well, this does not
stop us from a successful science.

00:19:49.944 --> 00:19:52.756
What we have is one theory
that turned out to be false,

00:19:52.756 --> 00:19:57.215
that perception is like reality
and reality is like our perceptions.

00:19:57.215 --> 00:19:58.900
That theory turns out to be false.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.318
Okay, throw that theory away.

00:20:00.318 --> 00:20:03.572
That doesn't stop us from now postulating
all sorts of other theories

00:20:03.572 --> 00:20:04.930
about the nature of reality,

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.535
so it's actually progress to recognize
that one of our theories was false.

00:20:08.535 --> 00:20:11.193
So science continues as normal.
There's no problem here.

00:20:11.193 --> 00:20:13.794
CA: So you think it's possible
-- (Laughter) --

00:20:13.794 --> 00:20:17.904
This is cool, but what you're saying
I think is it's possible that evolution

00:20:17.904 --> 00:20:20.551
can still get you to reason.

00:20:20.551 --> 00:20:22.864
DH: Yes. Now that's a very,
very good point.

00:20:22.864 --> 00:20:27.391
The evolutionary game simulations that I
showed were specifically about perception,

00:20:27.391 --> 00:20:29.969
and they do show that our perceptions
have been shaped

00:20:29.969 --> 00:20:31.849
not to show us reality as it is,

00:20:31.849 --> 00:20:36.122
but that does not mean the same thing
about our logic or mathematics.

00:20:36.122 --> 00:20:39.744
We haven't done these simulations,
but my bet is that we'll find

00:20:39.744 --> 00:20:43.366
that there are some selection pressures
for our logic and our mathematics

00:20:43.366 --> 00:20:45.572
to be at least in the direction of truth.

00:20:45.572 --> 00:20:48.219
I mean, if you're like me,
math and logic is not easy.

00:20:48.219 --> 00:20:51.570
We don't get it all right, but at least
the selection pressures are not

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.908
uniformly away from true math and logic.

00:20:53.908 --> 00:20:57.228
So I think that we'll find that we have
to look at each cognitive faculty

00:20:57.228 --> 00:20:59.852
one at a time and see
what evolution does to it.

00:20:59.852 --> 00:21:03.613
What's true about perception may not
be true about math and logic.

00:21:03.613 --> 00:21:07.607
CA: I mean, really what you're proposing
is a kind of modern-day Bishop Berkeley

00:21:07.607 --> 00:21:09.998
interpretation of the world:

00:21:09.998 --> 00:21:12.947
consciousness causes matter,
not the other way around.

00:21:12.947 --> 00:21:15.339
DH: Well, it's slightly
different than Berkeley.

00:21:15.339 --> 00:21:18.701
Berkeley thought that, he was a deist,
and he thought that the ultimate

00:21:18.701 --> 00:21:20.740
nature of reality is God
and so forth,

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.850
and I don't need to go
where Berkeley's going,

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.545
so it's quite a bit
different from Berkeley.

00:21:27.725 --> 00:21:31.235
I call this conscious realism.
It's actually a very different approach.
