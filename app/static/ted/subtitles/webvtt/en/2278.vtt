WEBVTT

00:00:00.963 --> 00:00:02.892
This is a play called "Sell/Buy/Date."

00:00:02.892 --> 00:00:05.963
It's my first since "Bridge and Tunnel,"
which I did on Broadway,

00:00:05.963 --> 00:00:09.333
and this one, I -- thank you --

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:13.995
I've excerpted it just for you,
so here we go.

00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:20.901
Right. Class, let's be absolutely certain

00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:25.618
all electronic devices are switched off
before we begin.

00:00:26.268 --> 00:00:31.375
So class, hopefully you'll recognize
what you just heard me say as the -- ?

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:35.199
Very good, the cellular
phone announcement.

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.378
Right? This was also known
as a mobile phone.

00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:41.607
So you'll remember, people of that era

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:46.483
would have had an external
electronic device, right,

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:48.434
something like this,

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:51.370
and they all would have carried
one of these around with them,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.749
and amongst their biggest fears
was the sheer mortification

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:58.139
that one of these might ring
at some inopportune moment.

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:00.540
Right? So a bit of trivia
about that era for you.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.100
(Laughter)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.851
So the format of today's class is

00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:09.793
I will be presenting multiple
BERT modules today

00:01:09.793 --> 00:01:12.163
from that period in history, right,

00:01:12.163 --> 00:01:14.973
so starting circa 2016.

00:01:14.973 --> 00:01:19.320
And remember, this was
the very first year of the BERT program.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.690
So we've got quite a few
of these to get through.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.697
Bear in mind, I will be living
into various different bodies,

00:01:25.697 --> 00:01:26.875
different ages,

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:31.403
also what were then called races,
or ethnic groups,

00:01:31.403 --> 00:01:33.493
as you'll remember from Unit 1.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.813
And -- (Laughter) -- and along
the gender continuum,

00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:39.321
I will be living into males as well.

00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:40.991
It was quite binary at that time.

00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:42.550
(Laughter)

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.867
Also, don't forget, we are reading
the book module

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:47.842
for next week's focus on gender.

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:51.885
Now, I know some of you
have requested the book in pill form.

00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:56.201
I know people still believe
ingesting it is better for retention,

00:01:56.201 --> 00:02:01.700
but since we are trying to experience
what our forebears did, right,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.207
let's please just consider doing
the actual ocular reading, okay?

00:02:07.207 --> 00:02:12.222
And also, how many people
have your emotional shunts engaged?

00:02:12.222 --> 00:02:14.916
Right. Please toggle them off. Okay?

00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:19.861
I know it's challenging, but I want you
to be able to feel the entire

00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:21.719
natural emo range, all right?

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.528
It is essential to this
part of the syllabus.

00:02:25.888 --> 00:02:27.126
Yes, Macy?

00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:31.627
All right. I understand.
If you're unwilling to --

00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:33.996
All right, well, we can discuss
that after class.

00:02:33.996 --> 00:02:36.429
All right, we will discuss your concerns.

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:40.549
Just relax. Nobody's died
and gone to composting.

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.893
Okay. After class. Okay? After class.

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:47.144
Let's just get started, okay.

00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:53.552
This first subject identified
as a middle-class homemaker.

00:02:53.552 --> 00:02:55.851
Remember, these early modules

00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:59.984
in these people's full identities
were protected,

00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:03.200
and this allowed them to speak
more freely on our topic,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.133
which for many of them was taboo.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.732
Okay honey, now,
I'm ready when you are.

00:03:11.732 --> 00:03:14.960
No, sweetheart, I said,
I'm ready when you are.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.351
I'm freezing.

00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:21.206
It's like a meat locker in here
in this recording studio.

00:03:21.206 --> 00:03:23.806
I should have brought a shmata.

00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:27.405
All this fancy technology
but they can't afford heat.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.678
What is he saying? I can't hear you!

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:34.557
I can't hear you
through the glass, honey!

00:03:34.557 --> 00:03:37.320
There you are in my ear.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.920
Oh, you can hear me?

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.778
The whole time.

00:03:41.778 --> 00:03:44.864
Oh, yes, I am a little chilly.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.553
Yes, oh the cold is for the machines,
the new technology. Okay.

00:03:51.553 --> 00:03:57.304
Yes, now remind me again, you're recording
not only my voice but my feelings

00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:59.604
and my memories? Right.

00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:02.433
Yes, BERT, yes, I read about it.

00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:05.484
Bio-Empathetic Resonant Technology.

00:04:05.484 --> 00:04:10.641
Right, right, so people will be able
to feel my experience

00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:12.543
and my memory? Okay.

00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:13.958
No, right, I'm ready.

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:18.055
I just thought you were going to give me
a test to see how my memory's doing.

00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:21.272
I was going to tell you you're too late,
it's already bad news.

00:04:22.847 --> 00:04:25.648
No, no, go ahead, honey.

00:04:25.648 --> 00:04:27.984
Oh, that's the first question?

00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:31.258
What do I think of prostitution?

00:04:31.258 --> 00:04:34.599
Are you soliciting me, young man?

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:39.955
I've heard of May-December romances,
but what are you, about 20 years old?

00:04:41.102 --> 00:04:42.844
Eighteen? Eighteen years.

00:04:42.844 --> 00:04:48.463
I think I have candies in my purse
older than 18 years old.

00:04:48.463 --> 00:04:49.941
(Laughter)

00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:56.520
I'm teasing you, sweetheart.
No, I'm comfortable with any question.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.371
Sure. So about the prostitution --
oh, sex worker, sex worker.

00:05:03.951 --> 00:05:07.920
No, just in my day, they called it
prostitution, not sex work.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.666
Oh, because it includes pornography also?

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:12.477
Okay.

00:05:12.477 --> 00:05:14.659
No, well, I guess when I was a girl,

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:17.167
we didn't really have
a name for that either.

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:22.902
We would have said dirty magazines,
I suppose, or dirty movies.

00:05:22.902 --> 00:05:25.370
Well, it's not like what you have
with the Internet.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.636
No, well, I don't mind sharing.

00:05:29.636 --> 00:05:34.628
My late husband and I,
we were a very romantic couple.

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:38.714
Lots of tenderness, you understand.

00:05:39.794 --> 00:05:43.164
Well, as you get older, you know,
at one point I thought my husband

00:05:43.164 --> 00:05:47.317
might be helped by using
some of the pills men can take,

00:05:49.317 --> 00:05:52.413
but he wasn't interested in those,

00:05:52.413 --> 00:05:58.474
so I thought, what about maybe
watching an adult movie on the Internet?

00:05:58.474 --> 00:06:01.908
Just for inspiration, you understand.

00:06:01.908 --> 00:06:06.906
Well, at the time, neither of us
were very good on the computer,

00:06:06.906 --> 00:06:09.619
so usually, if we needed help
with the Internet,

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:14.597
we would just call our children
or our grandchildren,

00:06:14.597 --> 00:06:18.163
but obviously, in this case,
that wasn't an option,

00:06:18.163 --> 00:06:23.588
so I thought, I'll have
a look myself, just to see.

00:06:23.588 --> 00:06:26.127
How difficult could it be?

00:06:26.127 --> 00:06:29.760
You search for certain key words
and you look --

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.955
Oh wow is right, young man.

00:06:31.955 --> 00:06:34.672
You can't imagine what I saw.

00:06:34.672 --> 00:06:39.618
Well, first of all, I was just trying
to find, you know, couples,

00:06:39.618 --> 00:06:41.963
normal couples making love,

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:47.791
but this, so many people
together at one time.

00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:51.599
You couldn't tell which part
belonged to which body.

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.778
How they even got the cameras to
capture some of this, I couldn't tell you.

00:06:55.778 --> 00:07:00.608
But the one thing they didn't capture
was making love.

00:07:02.658 --> 00:07:07.388
There was lots of making of something,

00:07:07.388 --> 00:07:11.497
but they took the love part
right out of it, you know, the fun.

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:15.421
It was all very extreme, you know?

00:07:15.421 --> 00:07:17.929
Like you would say,
with the extreme sports.

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:22.778
Lots of endurance,

00:07:22.778 --> 00:07:25.800
but never tenderness.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.116
So anyway, needless to say,
that was $19.95 I'll never get back again,

00:07:32.116 --> 00:07:36.945
but it only showed up on the credit card
as "entertainment services,"

00:07:36.945 --> 00:07:39.732
so my husband was never the wiser,

00:07:39.732 --> 00:07:42.083
and after all of that,

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:45.572
well, you could say it turned out

00:07:45.572 --> 00:07:49.412
he didn't need the extra
inspiration after all.

00:07:51.152 --> 00:07:54.734
Right, so next subject is a young woman
-- (Applause) --

00:07:55.924 --> 00:07:58.957
Next subject, class,
is a young woman called Bella,

00:07:58.957 --> 00:08:02.904
a university student interviewed in 2016

00:08:02.904 --> 00:08:06.828
during what was called
an Intro to Feminist Porn class

00:08:06.828 --> 00:08:11.317
as part of her major in sex work
at a college in the Bay Area.

00:08:11.317 --> 00:08:14.672
(Laughter)

00:08:14.672 --> 00:08:17.439
Yeah, I just want to, like,
get a recording of, like,

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:19.808
you guys recording me,

00:08:19.808 --> 00:08:21.897
like a meta recording, or whatever.

00:08:22.887 --> 00:08:26.611
It's just like this whole experience
is just, like, really amazing,

00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:30.131
and I'd like to capture that
for, like, Instagram and my Tumblr.

00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:33.126
So, like, hi guys, it's me, Bella,

00:08:33.126 --> 00:08:36.633
and I am, like, being
interviewed right now

00:08:37.723 --> 00:08:43.505
for this, like, really amazing
Bio-Empathetic Resonance Technology,

00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:49.780
which is, like, basically where they are,
like, recording, as you can see

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.702
from these, whatever, like, electrodes,

00:08:51.702 --> 00:08:57.040
the formation of, like, neuropeptides
in my hippocampus, or whatever.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.920
They will later be able
to reconstitute these

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.280
as, like, my own actual memory,
like actual experiences,

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.645
so other people can, like,
actually feel what I'm feeling right now.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.572
Okay. Okay.

00:09:14.572 --> 00:09:20.140
So, like, hello, BERT person of the future
who is experiencing me.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.557
This is what it feels like to be,
like, a college freshman,

00:09:24.557 --> 00:09:29.781
and also the, like, headache
that you are experiencing through me

00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:36.200
is the, like, residual effect
of the Jell-O shots which I had last night

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.115
at the bi-weekly feminist
pole dancing party

00:09:39.115 --> 00:09:42.157
which I cohost on Wednesdays.

00:09:42.157 --> 00:09:45.779
It's called "Don't Get All Pole-emical" --
(Laughter) --

00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:49.122
and it's in Beekman Hall,

00:09:50.072 --> 00:09:52.250
and, what else, like,

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.297
non-Jell-O shots are also
available for vegans,

00:09:56.297 --> 00:10:04.540
and, oh, okay, yeah, totally, yeah, we
should also focus on your questions also.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.182
So for your record, I am, like,
a sex work studies major

00:10:10.182 --> 00:10:12.457
but minoring in social media

00:10:12.457 --> 00:10:15.151
with a concentration
on notable YouTube memes.

00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:17.289
(Laughter)

00:10:18.239 --> 00:10:21.490
Yes, well, of course, like,
I consider myself to be, like,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.579
obviously, like, a feminist.

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:28.571
I was named for Bella Abzug,
who was, like, a famous, like,

00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:30.986
feminist from history,

00:10:30.986 --> 00:10:37.255
and, like, also I feel that it is, like,
important to, like, represent women

00:10:37.255 --> 00:10:40.945
who are, like, sex-positive feminists.

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:44.941
What is sex-negative?

00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:49.399
Well, like, I guess I would ask,
like, what do you think

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.417
sex-negative is? (Laughter)

00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:57.314
Yeah, because, like, the terms that we use
are, like, so important, because, like,

00:10:57.314 --> 00:11:04.352
we call it sex work because it helps
people understand that, like, it's work,

00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:09.228
and, like, you know, just like there are,
like, healthcare providers

00:11:09.228 --> 00:11:11.712
and, like, insurance providers,

00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:17.401
like, we think of these workers
as, like, sex care providers.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:22.184
Yeah, but like, I don't think of myself
like, providing direct

00:11:22.184 --> 00:11:26.433
sex care services per se as, like,
being a requirement

00:11:26.433 --> 00:11:28.894
for me to be, like, an advocate.

00:11:28.894 --> 00:11:32.563
Like, I support other women's right
to choose it voluntarily, like,

00:11:32.563 --> 00:11:34.676
if they enjoy it.

00:11:34.676 --> 00:11:37.509
Yeah, but, like, I see
myself going forward

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:41.247
as more likely, like,
protecting sex workers',

00:11:41.247 --> 00:11:44.288
like, legal freedoms and rights.

00:11:44.288 --> 00:11:48.213
Yeah, so, like, basically,
I'm planning on becoming a lawyer.

00:11:50.133 --> 00:11:51.835
Right, class. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:11:51.835 --> 00:11:55.921
So these next two modules
are also circa 2016.

00:11:55.921 --> 00:11:59.915
One subject is an Irishwoman
with a particularly noteworthy

00:11:59.915 --> 00:12:02.847
relationship to this issue,

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:06.509
but first will be a West Indian woman,

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:08.831
a self-described escort

00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:14.241
who was recorded at a
sex workers' rights rally and parade.

00:12:14.241 --> 00:12:18.792
She was interviewed whilst marching
in full carnival headdress

00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:21.460
and very little else.

00:12:24.295 --> 00:12:26.379
All right, you want me
to start talking now.

00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:29.509
Yeah, I told you, you can
put those wires anywhere you want to

00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:32.536
as long as it don't get in the way.

00:12:33.164 --> 00:12:38.069
Yeah, no, but, tell me again
what the name of -- BERT? BERT.

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:41.108
Yeah, I was telling you, you know,
I think I have in all my time

00:12:41.108 --> 00:12:44.797
I have had at least one client with that
name, so this won't be the first time

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:47.396
I had BERT all over me.

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:53.218
Oh, I'm sorry,

00:12:53.218 --> 00:12:56.670
but you got to get into the spirit of it
if you're going to interview me.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.536
All right? You can say it.

00:12:58.536 --> 00:13:00.934
No justice, no piece!
No justice, no piece!

00:13:00.934 --> 00:13:06.878
But you see the sign? You get it?
P-I-E-C-E. No justice, no piece of us.

00:13:06.878 --> 00:13:08.790
You understand?

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.244
Right, so that's the part
where I was telling you

00:13:11.244 --> 00:13:15.609
is that when I first came to this country,
I worked every job I could find.

00:13:15.609 --> 00:13:20.299
I was a nanny; I was a home care attendant
for all these different old people,

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:24.422
and then I said, child, if I have to touch
another white man's backside,

00:13:24.422 --> 00:13:27.381
I might as well get paid
a lot more money for it than this,

00:13:27.381 --> 00:13:29.285
you understand?

00:13:29.285 --> 00:13:32.350
Pshh, you know how hard it is
being a domestic worker?

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.729
Some of these men, they're heavy.

00:13:34.729 --> 00:13:37.528
You have to pick them up
and flip them over.

00:13:37.528 --> 00:13:41.986
Now, I let them pick me up
and flip me over, you understand?

00:13:41.986 --> 00:13:45.399
Well, you have to have a sense of humor
about it, that's what I think.

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:47.349
No, but see, listen,

00:13:47.349 --> 00:13:50.739
you find me somebody who don't hate
some part of their job.

00:13:50.739 --> 00:13:53.502
I mean, there's a lot of things
about this job that I hate,

00:13:53.502 --> 00:13:55.072
but the money is not one of them,

00:13:55.072 --> 00:13:57.891
and I will tell you, as long as this
is the best possibility

00:13:57.891 --> 00:13:59.655
for me to make real money,

00:13:59.655 --> 00:14:03.811
I am going to be Jamaican-No-Fakin'
if that's what they want to call me.

00:14:03.811 --> 00:14:07.318
No, I'm not even from Jamaica.
That's how they market me.

00:14:07.318 --> 00:14:10.545
My family is from Trinidad
and the Virgin Islands.

00:14:11.495 --> 00:14:13.711
They don't know what I do,
but you know what?

00:14:13.711 --> 00:14:16.977
My children, they know
that their school fees are paid,

00:14:16.977 --> 00:14:19.484
they have their books and their computer,

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:22.456
and this way, I know
that they have a chance.

00:14:22.456 --> 00:14:25.266
So I'm not going to tell you
that what I do, it's easy,

00:14:25.266 --> 00:14:28.818
I'm not going to tell you that I feel --
what's that you said, liberated?

00:14:30.128 --> 00:14:32.920
But I'm going to tell you
that I feel paid.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.129
Right. (Applause)

00:14:38.872 --> 00:14:41.496
Thanks, that's lovely,
and just the cup of tea, love,

00:14:41.496 --> 00:14:43.470
and just a splash of the whiskey.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:48.200
It's perfect, that's grand.
Just a drop more. A splash. Perfect.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.550
What was your name? Peter?
Is that right, so, Peter?

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.708
Right. So that, that is
the unique part of it for me,

00:14:54.708 --> 00:14:57.401
right, is that I ended up in both,

00:14:58.681 --> 00:15:02.550
first in the convent, and then
in the prostitution after. That's right.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.160
(Laughter)

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.120
So one woman at the university
here in Dublin, she wrote about me.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:13.820
She said, Maureen Fitzroy is the living
embodiment of the whore-virgin dichotomy.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.341
Right? (Laughter)

00:15:15.341 --> 00:15:18.359
Doesn't it sound like something
you need to go into hospital?

00:15:18.359 --> 00:15:20.248
Well, I've got this terrible dichotomy.

00:15:20.248 --> 00:15:21.411
Doesn't it.

00:15:21.781 --> 00:15:25.119
Right. Well, for me though, it was,
as a girl, it started with me dad.

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:28.394
I mean, half the time, when he
spoke to us, it was just a sort of

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:32.856
tell us we were all useless rotten idiots
and we had no morals, that type of thing.

00:15:32.856 --> 00:15:36.177
And I certainly didn't
do myself any favors.

00:15:36.177 --> 00:15:38.406
By the time I was 16,

00:15:38.406 --> 00:15:41.285
I had started messing about
with this older fella,

00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:44.837
and he wanted it to be
our little secret,

00:15:44.837 --> 00:15:47.345
and I did as I was told, didn't I,

00:15:47.345 --> 00:15:53.452
and when that got back to me dad, he
had me sent straightaway to the convent.

00:15:54.752 --> 00:15:58.420
Well no, that older fella, he would still
come to find me in the convent.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.766
Yeah, he'd leave me notes

00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:04.001
tucked into the holes in the brick
at the back of the charity shop

00:16:04.001 --> 00:16:05.188
so we could meet.

00:16:05.188 --> 00:16:08.915
And he'd tell me how
he's leaving his wife,

00:16:08.915 --> 00:16:13.141
and I believed him, until I got pregnant.

00:16:13.141 --> 00:16:18.458
I did, Peter, and I left him a note
about it in our special place there,

00:16:18.458 --> 00:16:21.477
and I never did hear from him again.

00:16:21.477 --> 00:16:26.490
No, I gave it up for adoption
so it could have a decent life,

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.675
and then they wouldn't let me
back into the convent.

00:16:30.815 --> 00:16:34.273
No, my one sister Virginia gave me
a fiver for the coach to Dublin,

00:16:34.273 --> 00:16:36.221
and that's how I ended up here.

00:16:36.991 --> 00:16:41.120
Well, surprise, surprise, I fell in love
with another fella much older than me,

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.159
and I always say I was just so happy
because he didn't drink,

00:16:47.349 --> 00:16:49.502
I married the bastard.

00:16:50.502 --> 00:16:54.184
Well, he didn't drink, but he did have
just the wee heroin problem, didn't he,

00:16:54.184 --> 00:16:57.279
and -- That's right, and before I knew it,

00:16:57.279 --> 00:17:00.903
he was the one who turned me on
to the prostitution, my own husband.

00:17:01.703 --> 00:17:03.771
He had me supporting the both of us.

00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:05.314
I was 18.

00:17:06.144 --> 00:17:09.089
Well, it wasn't Pretty Woman,
I can tell you that.

00:17:10.509 --> 00:17:12.356
That Julia Roberts,

00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:17.569
if she'd ever had to sleep with a man
to put a few pounds in her pocket,

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.110
I don't think she'd ever
have made that film.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.339
Well, for your record,

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.520
my opinion of the legalization,
I'd say I'm against it.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.864
I just, I don't care what
these young girls say.

00:17:28.864 --> 00:17:31.975
You know, living like that,
you're just lost,

00:17:31.975 --> 00:17:34.483
and, you know, I'm 63 years old.

00:17:34.483 --> 00:17:36.523
I'm still trying to find who I am.

00:17:37.503 --> 00:17:41.240
You know, I never was a wife or a nun,

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.560
or a prostitute even, really, not really.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.648
Nobody ever asked who I wanted to be.

00:17:47.648 --> 00:17:49.482
They just told me,

00:17:49.482 --> 00:17:51.433
and if you legalize it,

00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:55.264
then you're really telling these girls,
"Go on and get lost for a living,"

00:17:55.264 --> 00:17:57.872
and a lot of them,
they'll do as they're told.

00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:03.669
All right, so four perspectives
from four quite -- (Applause) --

00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:05.829
four quite different voices there, right?

00:18:05.829 --> 00:18:10.146
One woman saying sex itself is natural
but the sex industry seems to

00:18:10.786 --> 00:18:12.794
mechanize or industrialize it.

00:18:12.794 --> 00:18:17.162
Then the second woman considered
sex work to be empowering,

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:20.991
liberating, and feminist,
though she, herself, notably,

00:18:20.991 --> 00:18:23.568
did not seem keen to do it.

00:18:23.568 --> 00:18:27.995
The third woman, who actually was
a so-called sex worker

00:18:27.995 --> 00:18:31.340
did not agree that it was liberating
but she wanted the right

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.100
to the economic empowerment,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.412
and then we hear the fourth woman
saying not only prostitution itself

00:18:36.412 --> 00:18:38.938
but proscribed roles for women in general

00:18:38.938 --> 00:18:42.398
prevented her from ever
finding who she was, right?

00:18:42.398 --> 00:18:44.395
So another fact most people did not know

00:18:44.395 --> 00:18:50.080
was the average age of an at-risk girl
being introduced to the sex industry

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.110
was 12 or 13.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.146
Also consider that the age
when all girls in that society

00:18:55.146 --> 00:18:58.791
first became exposed
to sexualized images of women

00:18:58.791 --> 00:19:01.345
was quite a bit earlier, right?

00:19:01.345 --> 00:19:06.105
This was a doll called Barbie, right?

00:19:06.105 --> 00:19:09.692
I initially thought she was an educational
tool for anorexia prevention --

00:19:09.692 --> 00:19:10.842
(Laughter) --

00:19:10.842 --> 00:19:14.209
but actually she was considered by many

00:19:14.209 --> 00:19:18.272
to be a wholesome symbol of femininity,

00:19:18.272 --> 00:19:21.615
and often young girls began
what was called dieting.

00:19:21.615 --> 00:19:25.854
Remember this? This was
restricting food intake on purpose

00:19:25.854 --> 00:19:27.234
by the age of six,

00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:30.061
and defining themselves
based on attractiveness

00:19:30.061 --> 00:19:31.901
by around that same time. Right?

00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:33.112
Yes?

00:19:33.712 --> 00:19:35.756
Right, Bradley, okay, excellent point.

00:19:35.756 --> 00:19:40.585
So there was a lucrative market
in that society in convincing all people

00:19:40.585 --> 00:19:44.463
they had to look a certain way
to even have a sex life, right?

00:19:44.463 --> 00:19:49.618
But girls, especially, were expected
to be "sexy" while avoiding

00:19:49.618 --> 00:19:52.970
being perceived as "sluts"
for being sexual. Right?

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.237
So there's that shame piece
we've heard about.

00:19:55.237 --> 00:19:56.839
Yes.

00:19:56.839 --> 00:19:58.696
Valerie, right? Okay, very good.

00:19:58.696 --> 00:20:01.506
Of course, men were having sex as well,

00:20:01.506 --> 00:20:03.944
but you'll remember from the reading,

00:20:03.944 --> 00:20:05.625
what were male sluts called?

00:20:06.675 --> 00:20:08.541
Very good, they were called men.

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.747
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:20:10.747 --> 00:20:16.319
So not easy living in
a world like that, right?

00:20:16.859 --> 00:20:18.711
Though it was not all bad news either.

00:20:18.711 --> 00:20:22.217
Most women in the early 2000s
considered themselves empowered,

00:20:22.217 --> 00:20:26.450
and men generally felt they were
also evolved in this area,

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.300
and, in fact, most people would have
been aware of issues

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.235
like human trafficking, for example,

00:20:31.235 --> 00:20:33.636
but they would have seen that
as quite separate

00:20:33.636 --> 00:20:36.427
from more recreational
adult entertainment.

00:20:36.427 --> 00:20:39.850
And so we'll just very briefly, class --
we don't have a lot of time --

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.065
we'll just very briefly hear from a man

00:20:42.065 --> 00:20:43.839
on our topic at this stage.

00:20:43.839 --> 00:20:49.474
So this next subject was interviewed
on the night of his bachelor party.

00:20:51.426 --> 00:20:54.979
Dude, can you, all right,
can you just keep it down?

00:20:54.979 --> 00:20:57.185
I'm trying to talk to BERT right now.

00:20:57.185 --> 00:20:58.778
Oh, your name's not BERT.

00:20:59.298 --> 00:21:01.573
BERT's the name of the, oh, all right.

00:21:01.573 --> 00:21:04.638
No, no, no, totally, it's totally fine.
I'm mostly sober,

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:07.473
so I just want to be helpful.

00:21:08.073 --> 00:21:11.892
Yeah, and I totally believe in causes,
yeah, like, all that stuff.

00:21:11.892 --> 00:21:13.332
(Laughter)

00:21:13.332 --> 00:21:15.714
And actually, I'm wearing Toms right now.

00:21:16.954 --> 00:21:20.560
Yeah, Toms, like, the shoes,

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.887
like, you buy a pair and then
a kid in Africa gets clean water.

00:21:24.857 --> 00:21:26.394
Yeah. Totally.

00:21:26.394 --> 00:21:29.181
But what was the question again? Sorry.

00:21:29.181 --> 00:21:33.889
Of course I believe in women's rights.
I'm marrying a woman.

00:21:33.889 --> 00:21:36.389
(Laughter)

00:21:36.389 --> 00:21:40.018
No, but I mean, like, just because
I'm in a strip club parking lot

00:21:40.018 --> 00:21:43.042
doesn't mean that I'm, like,
a sexist or whatever.

00:21:43.042 --> 00:21:47.454
My fiancee is totally amazing,
she's totally a strong girl, woman,

00:21:47.454 --> 00:21:49.949
smart woman, like, the whole thing.

00:21:49.949 --> 00:21:53.518
Yeah, she knows I'm here. She's probably
at a strip club herself right now,

00:21:53.518 --> 00:21:55.510
like, as a joke, same as me.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.602
My best man, I told him
he could surprise me,

00:21:57.602 --> 00:21:59.597
and he thought this would be hilarious,

00:21:59.597 --> 00:22:01.700
but this is not something.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.720
Yeah, we all went to B school together.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.540
Wharton.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.724
(Laughter)

00:22:07.724 --> 00:22:10.171
Yeah, so, dude, can you guys --

00:22:10.171 --> 00:22:12.087
All right, but it's my bachelor party,

00:22:12.087 --> 00:22:15.595
and I can spend it in the parking lot
with Anderson Cooper if I want to.

00:22:15.595 --> 00:22:18.266
All right, I'll see you in there.

00:22:19.076 --> 00:22:21.214
All right, okay, so Anderson,

00:22:21.214 --> 00:22:25.111
so, like, first of all, stripping,

00:22:25.111 --> 00:22:27.895
but then, like, all the other things
you're talking about,

00:22:27.895 --> 00:22:31.403
prostitution and all that stuff,
that's, like, not the same thing at all.

00:22:31.403 --> 00:22:34.659
You know? Like, you keep calling it
the sex industry or whatever,

00:22:34.659 --> 00:22:38.605
but it's like, if the girl wants
to be an exotic dancer

00:22:38.605 --> 00:22:42.072
and she's 18, like, that's her right.

00:22:43.092 --> 00:22:46.340
Whoa, whoa, I hear what you're saying,
but I just feel like people,

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.976
they just want to make it seem
like all dudes are just, like, predators,

00:22:49.976 --> 00:22:53.114
that we would just automatically
go to a prostitute, or whatever.

00:22:53.114 --> 00:22:57.410
Even, like, when I pledged, you know,
like when I rushed my fraternity.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.337
My brothers who I'm close to,
those guys, they're all like me.

00:23:01.337 --> 00:23:05.290
We're just normal people, but, like,
there's this myth that you must

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:09.928
be that guy who is kind of an asshole,
and like, all bros before hos or whatever.

00:23:09.928 --> 00:23:13.643
And actually, like, bros before hos,
it doesn't mean like what it sounds like.

00:23:14.603 --> 00:23:18.380
It's actually just like a joking way of
saying that you care about your brothers

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.516
and you put them first.

00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:23.576
Yeah, but, you can't blame
the media, either.

00:23:23.576 --> 00:23:26.110
I mean, like, if you
go watch "Hangover 2,"

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.264
and you think that's an instruction manual

00:23:28.264 --> 00:23:30.800
for your life, like,
I don't know what to tell you.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.862
You know? You don't
watch "Bourne Identity"

00:23:32.862 --> 00:23:37.106
and go drive your car
over a gondola in Venice. (Laughter)

00:23:37.736 --> 00:23:40.672
Well, yeah, okay, like, if you're
a little kid or whatever,

00:23:40.672 --> 00:23:42.876
of course it's different, but --

00:23:42.876 --> 00:23:46.570
Yeah, all right, I remember
one thing like that.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.480
I was at this kid's house
one time playing GTA,

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.510
uh, Grand Theft Auto?

00:23:53.417 --> 00:23:56.123
Dude, are you from Canada? (Laughter)

00:23:57.593 --> 00:24:00.986
So, like, whatever, with Grand Theft Auto,

00:24:00.986 --> 00:24:04.160
you're this kid, like, you're this guy
walking around or whatever,

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.092
and you can basically, like,
the more cops you kill,

00:24:07.092 --> 00:24:09.763
the more points you get,
and stuff like that.

00:24:09.763 --> 00:24:12.601
But also, you can find prostitutes

00:24:12.601 --> 00:24:15.798
and obviously you can do
sexual stuff with them,

00:24:15.798 --> 00:24:19.655
but you can, like, kill them
and take your money back.

00:24:20.525 --> 00:24:24.466
Yeah, this kid, I remember he ran over
a couple of them a few times with his car

00:24:24.466 --> 00:24:27.320
and he got all these points.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.755
We were, like, 10, I think.

00:24:31.685 --> 00:24:33.777
It felt pretty terrible, actually.

00:24:34.827 --> 00:24:40.215
No, I don't think I said anything,
I just finished playing and went home.

00:24:40.845 --> 00:24:43.770
All right class, so then there were men
who had more than just

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:46.135
a passing relationship to this issue.
(Laughter)

00:24:47.955 --> 00:24:52.880
The next subject described himself
as a reformed and remorseful pimp

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.526
turned motivational speaker,

00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:56.964
life coach and therapist,

00:24:56.964 --> 00:25:00.934
but if you want to know more about him,
you'll have to come to the entire play.

00:25:00.934 --> 00:25:04.920
Thank you so much,
you beautiful TED audience.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.716
I will see you for "Sell/Buy/Date."

00:25:06.716 --> 00:25:12.287
(Applause)
