00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A great way to start, I think, with my view of simplicity

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is to take a look at TED. Here you are, understanding why we're here,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
what's going on with no difficulty at all.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but would miss the point.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
He would have a great time.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And of course, if you're a speaker here, like Hans Rosling,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
a speaker finds this complex, tricky. But in Hans Rosling's case,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
he had a secret weapon yesterday,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
literally, in his sword swallowing act.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I must say, I thought of quite a few objects

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but that we're easily fooled. In fact, what Shakespeare

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
so we're actually looking forward to it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We go to magic shows in order to be fooled.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And this makes many things fun, but it makes it difficult to actually

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And our friend, Betty Edwards,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" lady, shows these two tables

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to her drawing class and says,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
"The problem you have with learning to draw

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
is not that you can't move your hand,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's trying to perceive images into objects

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
rather than seeing what's there."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And to prove it, she says, "The exact size and shape of these tabletops

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is the same, and I'm going to prove it to you."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
She does this with cardboard, but since I have

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
an expensive computer here

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'll just rotate this little guy around and ...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Now having seen that -- and I've seen it hundreds of times,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because I use this in every talk I give -- I still can't see

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that they're the same size and shape, and I doubt that you can either.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So what do artists do? Well, what artists do is to measure.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
They measure very, very carefully.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And if you measure very, very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
you'll see that those two shapes are

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
exactly the same size.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And the Talmud saw this a long time ago, saying,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
"We see things not as they are, but as we are."

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I certainly would like to know what happened to the person

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
who had that insight back then,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
happening inside here. It's a waking dream,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and understanding that that is what we actually exist in

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And what that means: "simple and understandable"

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
might not be actually simple or understandable,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and things we think are "complex" might be made simple and understandable.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The way I think of it is, we can't learn to see

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
until we admit we're blind.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Once you start down at this very humble level,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
then you can start finding ways to see things.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And what's happened, over the last 400 years in particular,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is that human beings have invented "brainlets" --

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
little additional parts for our brain --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
made out of powerful ideas that help us

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
see the world in different ways.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And these are in the form of sensory apparatus --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
telescopes, microscopes -- reasoning apparatus --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
various ways of thinking -- and, most importantly,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
in the ability to change perspective on things.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I'll talk about that a little bit.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
It's this change in perspective

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
on what it is we think we're perceiving

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
than we have in the rest of human history.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And yet, it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I'm aware of.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So one of the things that goes from simple to complex

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
is when we do more. We like more.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
If we do more in a kind of a stupid way,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the simplicity gets complex

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and, in fact, we can keep on doing it for a very long time.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
But Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties;

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
another name for them could be "architecture"

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
as a metaphor for taking the same old material

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and thinking about non-obvious, non-simple ways of combining it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And in fact, what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
of having the descriptions

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
at various levels be rather similar --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
are both sticky and standoffish,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and they're in violent motion.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Those three things give rise to all the different levels

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
of what seem to be complexity in our world.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
But how simple?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So, when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
in conveying complex ideas simply.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But then I had a thought of, "Boy, maybe it's too simple."

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And I put some effort in to try and check

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and I found that they matched up very well.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
without removing what's important about the data.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Whereas the film yesterday that we saw

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
of the simulation of the inside of a cell,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
as a former molecular biologist, I didn't like that at all.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
about molecular biology, and that is:

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
finding each other just the right way

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
so they combine together and be catalyzed?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And what we saw yesterday was

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
every reaction was fortuitous;

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
they just swooped in the air and bound, and something happened.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But in fact, those molecules are spinning at the rate of

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
about a million revolutions per second;

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
they're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds;

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
they're completely crowded together, they're jammed,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
they're bashing up against each other.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and I think that's exactly the wrong image

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
for when you're trying to teach science.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So, another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
with the actual understanding of some principle.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So a kid who's 14 in high school

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
which is a truly subtle and interesting proof,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
but in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So a more direct one, one that gives you more of the feeling of math,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
is something closer to Pythagoras' own proof, which goes like this:

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
so here we have this triangle, and if we surround that C square with

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
three more triangles and we copy that,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
notice that we can move those triangles down like this.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and bingo. That is all you have to do.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And this kind of proof is the kind of proof

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
that you need to learn when you're learning mathematics

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
in order to get an idea of what it means

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
before you look into the, literally, 1,200 or 1,500 proofs

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
of Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Now let's go to young children.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
This is a very unusual teacher

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
but was a natural mathematician.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
but is a terrific musician;

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
she just had a feeling for math.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And here are her six-year-olds,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and she's got them making shapes out of a shape.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
So they pick a shape they like -- like a diamond, or a square,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
or a triangle, or a trapezoid -- and then they try and make

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the next larger shape of that same shape, and the next larger shape.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And what this teacher did on every project

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and then something like science.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So they had created these artifacts.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
which I thought for a long time, until she explained to me was

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
to slow them down so they'll think.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and pasting them up.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But the whole point of this thing is

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
for them to look at this chart and fill it out.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
"What have you noticed about what you did?"

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And so six-year-old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and the second one took three more

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and the total was four on that one,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and then the next one.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
She saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
around the edges was always going to grow by two,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
where she wasn't sure what six times six was

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and what seven times seven was,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
but then she was confident again.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So that's what Lauren did.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And then the teacher, Gillian Ishijima, had the kids

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and everybody went batshit: "Holy shit! They're the same!"

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
No matter what the shapes were, the growth law is the same.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
will recognize these two progressions

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
as a first-order discrete differential equation

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and a second-order discrete differential equation,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
derived by six-year-olds.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Well, that's pretty amazing.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
That isn't what we usually try to teach six-year-olds.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So, let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And so the first idea here is

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
just to show you the kind of things that children do.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I'm using the software that we're putting on the $100 laptop.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So I'd like to draw a little car here --

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I'll just do this very quickly -- and put a big tire on him.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And I get a little object here and I can look inside this object,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I'll call it a car. And here's a little behavior: car forward.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Each time I click it, car turn.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I just drag these guys out and set them going.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And I can try steering the car here by ...

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
See the car turn by five here?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So what if I click this down to zero?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Make it go in the other direction.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But of course, that's a little bit like kissing your sister

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
as far as driving a car,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
so the kids want to do a steering wheel;

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
so they draw a steering wheel.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And we'll call this a wheel.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
See this wheel's heading here?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
If I turn this wheel, you can see that number over there going minus and positive.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
That's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
those numbers coming out there

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and to just drop it into the script here,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And it's interesting.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
You know how much trouble the children have with variables,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
but by learning it this way, in a situated fashion,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
they never forget from this single trial

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
what a variable is and how to use it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So if you look at the little script here,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
the speed is always going to be 30.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
We're going to move the car according to that over and over again.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things;

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
they're evenly spaced because they're 30 apart.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
of saying, "OK, I'm going to increase the speed by two each time,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
What do I get there?"

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
So how do the children do science?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
(Video) Teacher: [Choose] objects that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Student 1: Ooh, this is nice.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Teacher: Do not pay any attention

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
to what anybody else is doing.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Who's got the apple?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Alan Kay: They've got little stopwatches.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Student 2: What did you get? What did you get?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
AK: Stopwatches aren't accurate enough.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Student 3: 0.99 seconds.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Teacher: So put "sponge ball" ...

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Student 4l: [I decided to] do the shot put and the sponge ball

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
because they're two totally different weights,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and if you drop them at the same time,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
maybe they'll drop at the same speed.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Teacher: Drop. Class: Whoa!

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
AK: So obviously, Aristotle never asked a child

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
about this particular point

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
because, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And it was not until Galileo actually did it

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
that an adult thought like a child,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
only 400 years ago.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
We get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
who will actually cut straight to the chase.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Now, what if we want to look at this more closely?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
We can take a movie of what's going on,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
but even if we single stepped this movie,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
it's tricky to see what's going on.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
or stack them up.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So when the children see this, they say, "Ah! Acceleration,"

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
So what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
to the bottom of the next image, about a fifth of a second later,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
like that. And they're getting faster and faster each time,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:09.000
and if I stack these guys up, then we see the differences; the increase

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
in the speed is constant.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And they say, "Oh, yeah. Constant acceleration.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
We've done that already."

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
So you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Galileo, by the way, did this very cleverly

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
this is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
but it's a great story.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And I thought I would do just one thing

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:13.000
on the $100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
So once you have gravity, here's this --

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
increase the speed by something,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
increase the ship's speed.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
If I start the little game here that the kids have done,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
it'll crash the space ship.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
But if I oppose gravity, here we go ... Oops!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
(Laughter)

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
One more.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Yeah, there we go. Yeah, OK?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.000
I guess the best way to end this is with two quotes:

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Marshall McLuhan said,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
"Children are the messages that we send to the future,"

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
but in fact, if you think of it,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
children are the future we send to the future.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Forget about messages;

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
children are the future,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
and children in the first and second world

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
and, most especially, in the third world

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
need mentors.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And this summer, we're going to build five million of these $100 laptops,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
and maybe 50 million next year.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000
But we couldn't create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
That means that we, once again, have a thing where we can put technology out,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
but the mentoring that is required to go

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
from a simple new iChat instant messaging system

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
to something with depth is missing.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
and this new kind of user interface could be done

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
with an expenditure of about 100 million dollars.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000
It sounds like a lot, but it is literally 18 minutes of what we're spending in Iraq --

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
we're spending 8 billion dollars a month; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars --

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
so this is actually cheap.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And Einstein said,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
"Things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler."

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Thank you.
