00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.223
Along the ancient path
of the Monongahela River,

00:00:05.223 --> 00:00:10.981
Braddock, Pennsylvania sits
in the eastern region of Allegheny County,

00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:15.348
approximately nine miles
outside of Pittsburgh.

00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:18.829
An industrial suburb,

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.570
Braddock is home
to Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.238
the Edgar Thomson Works.

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:27.560
Operating since 1875,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.738
it is the last functioning
steel mill in the region.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.101
For 12 years, I have produced
collaborative portraits,

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:42.373
still lifes, landscapes and aerial views

00:00:42.373 --> 00:00:47.724
in order to build a visual archive
to address the intersection

00:00:47.724 --> 00:00:49.571
of the steel industry,

00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:51.429
the environment,

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:58.071
and the health care system's impact
on the bodies of my family and community.

00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:02.644
The tradition and grand
narrative of Braddock

00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:08.439
is mostly comprised of stories
of industrialists and trade unions.

00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:13.027
Currently, the new narrative
about Braddock,

00:01:13.027 --> 00:01:16.564
a poster child for Rust Belt
revitalization,

00:01:16.564 --> 00:01:21.548
is a story of urban pioneers
discovering a new frontier.

00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:28.131
Mass media has omitted the fact
that Braddock is predominantly black.

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:34.640
Our existence has been co-opted,
silenced and erased.

00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:39.967
Fourth generation in a lineage of women,

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:44.657
I was raised under the protection
and care of Grandma Ruby,

00:01:44.657 --> 00:01:49.032
off 8th Street
at 805 Washington Avenue.

00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:54.120
She worked as a manager for Goodwill.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.814
Mom was a nurse's aid.

00:01:56.814 --> 00:02:03.161
She watched the steel mills close
and white flight to suburban developments.

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:07.332
By the time my generation
walked the streets,

00:02:07.332 --> 00:02:12.586
disinvestment at the local,
state and federal level,

00:02:12.586 --> 00:02:14.483
eroded infrastructure,

00:02:14.483 --> 00:02:20.764
and the War on Drugs
dismantled my family and community.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.305
Grandma Ruby's stepfather Gramps

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:28.994
was one of few black men to retire
from Carnegie's mill with his pension.

00:02:28.994 --> 00:02:31.201
He worked in high temperatures,

00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:36.930
tearing down and rebuilding furnaces,
cleaning up spilt metal and slag.

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:44.039
The history of a place is written
on the body and the landscape.

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:48.244
Areas of heavy truck traffic,

00:02:48.244 --> 00:02:52.609
exposure to benzene and atomized metals,

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.742
risk cancer and lupus.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.847
One hundred twenty-three licensed beds,
652 employees,

00:03:03.847 --> 00:03:08.349
rehabilitation programs decimated.

00:03:11.486 --> 00:03:15.363
A housing discrimination lawsuit
against Allegheny County

00:03:15.363 --> 00:03:21.215
removed where the projects
Talbot Towers once stood.

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:26.957
Recent rezoning for more light industry
has since appeared.

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:33.595
Google Maps and Google Earth pixelations
conceal the flammable waste

00:03:33.595 --> 00:03:38.890
being used to squeeze the Bunn family
off their home and land.

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:45.545
In 2013, I chartered a helicopter

00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:51.101
with my cameras to document
this aggressive dispossession.

00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:58.252
In flight, my observation reveals
thousands of plastic white bundles

00:03:58.252 --> 00:04:01.728
owned by a conservation industry

00:04:01.728 --> 00:04:03.981
that claims it's eco-friendly

00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:06.697
and recycles millions of tires

00:04:06.697 --> 00:04:09.484
to preserve people's lives

00:04:09.484 --> 00:04:12.560
and to improve people's lives.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.461
My work spirals from the micro
to the macro level,

00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:21.688
excavating hidden histories.

00:04:21.688 --> 00:04:24.196
Recently, at the Seattle Art Museum,

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:28.166
Isaac Bunn and I mounted this exhibition,

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:34.133
and the exhibition was used
as a platform to launch his voice.

00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:37.820
Through reclamation of our narrative,

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.319
we will continue to fight historic erasure
and socioeconomic inequality.

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:46.370
Thank you.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.400
(Applause)
