00:00:00.854 --> 00:00:06.403
The first time I uttered a prayer
was in a glass-stained cathedral.

00:00:06.403 --> 00:00:09.793
I was kneeling long after
the congregation was on its feet,

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:11.703
dip both hands into holy water,


00:00:11.703 --> 00:00:13.553
trace the trinity across my chest,

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:16.379
my tiny body drooping 
like a question mark

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.669
all over the wooden pew.

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.339
I asked Jesus to fix me,

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.465
and when he did not answer

00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:26.141
I befriended silence in the hopes
that my sin would burn

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:27.631
and salve my mouth

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:29.461
would dissolve like sugar on tongue,

00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:31.376
but shame lingered as an aftertaste.

00:00:31.376 --> 00:00:34.940
And in an attempt
to reintroduce me to sanctity,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.860
my mother told me of the miracle I was,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
said I could grow up 
to be anything I want.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.066
I decided to

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.227
be a boy.

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:45.217
It was cute.

00:00:45.217 --> 00:00:47.007
I had snapback, toothless grin,


00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:48.847
used skinned knees as street cred,

00:00:48.847 --> 00:00:51.277
played hide and seek with 
what was left of my goal.

00:00:51.277 --> 00:00:52.204
I was it.

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:54.629
The winner to a game 
the other kids couldn't play,

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.809
I was the mystery of an anatomy,

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.622
a question asked but not answered,


00:00:58.622 --> 00:01:02.918
tightroping between awkward boy
and apologetic girl,

00:01:02.918 --> 00:01:07.655
and when I turned 12, the boy phase
wasn't deemed cute anymore.

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:13.297
It was met with nostalgic aunts who missed
seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts,

00:01:13.297 --> 00:01:17.546
who reminded me that my kind of attitude
would never bring a husband home,

00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:21.168
that I exist for heterosexual marriage
and child-bearing.

00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:24.999
And I swallowed their insults
along with their slurs.

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:27.716
Naturally, I did not
come out of the closet.

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:30.432
The kids at my school opened it
without my permission.

00:01:30.432 --> 00:01:32.894
Called me by a name I did not recognize,

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:34.124
said "lesbian,"

00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:36.700
but I was more boy than girl,
more Ken than Barbie.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.903
It had nothing to do with hating my body,

00:01:38.903 --> 00:01:41.023
I just love it enough to let it go,


00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:42.409
I treat it like a house,

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.239
and when your house is falling apart,


00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:45.223
you do not evacuate,

00:01:45.223 --> 00:01:49.015
you make it comfortable enough
to house all your insides,

00:01:49.015 --> 00:01:51.376
you make it pretty enough
to invite guests over,

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:55.234
you make the floorboards
strong enough to stand on.

00:01:55.904 --> 00:02:00.919
My mother fears I have named
myself after fading things.

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:03.939
As she counts the echoes
left behind by Mya Hall,

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.489
Leelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington.

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.700
She fears that I'll die without a whisper,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.763
that I'll turn into "what a shame"
conversations at the bus stop.

00:02:11.763 --> 00:02:14.409
She claims I have turned myself
into a mausoleum,

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.035
that I am a walking casket,

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:19.239
news headlines have turned
my identity into a spectacle,

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.995
Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips
while the brutality of living in this body

00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:26.541
becomes an asterisk 
at the bottom of equality pages.

00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:29.637
No one ever thinks of us as human

00:02:29.637 --> 00:02:31.795
because we are more ghost than flesh,

00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:34.494
because people fear that
my gender expression is a trick,

00:02:34.494 --> 00:02:36.351
that it exists to be perverse,

00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:38.394
that it ensnares them
without their consent,

00:02:38.394 --> 00:02:41.088
that my body is a feast
for their eyes and hands

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:43.387
and once they have fed off my queer,

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:46.387
they'll regurgitate all the parts
they did not like.

00:02:46.387 --> 00:02:50.747
They'll put me back into the closet,
hang me with all the other skeletons.

00:02:50.747 --> 00:02:53.162
I will be the best attraction.

00:02:53.162 --> 00:02:56.241
Can you see how easy it is
to talk people into coffins,

00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:58.811
to misspell their names on gravestones.


00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:01.266
And people still wonder why
there are boys rotting,

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:03.657
they go away
in high school hallways

00:03:03.657 --> 00:03:06.559
they are afraid of becoming another
hashtag in a second

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:10.437
afraid of classroom discussions
becoming like judgment day

00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:16.172
and now oncoming traffic is embracing
more transgender children than parents.

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:18.807
I wonder how long it will be

00:03:18.807 --> 00:03:22.487
before the trans suicide notes
start to feel redundant,

00:03:22.487 --> 00:03:26.110
before we realize that our bodies
become lessons about sin

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.153
way before we learn how to love them.

00:03:28.153 --> 00:03:32.077
Like God didn't save
all this breath and mercy,

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:35.653
like my blood is not the wine
that washed over Jesus' feet.

00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:39.521
My prayers are now
getting stuck in my throat.

00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:43.175
Maybe I am finally fixed,

00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:45.428
maybe I just don't care,

00:03:45.428 --> 00:03:50.139
maybe God finally listened to my prayers.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.604
Thank you.

00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:53.708
(Applause)
