00:00:00.751 --> 00:00:07.636
This summer I was back
in Ohio for a family wedding,

00:00:07.784 --> 00:00:09.985
and when I was there,

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:13.338
there was a meet and greet
with Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."

00:00:13.478 --> 00:00:17.103
Not the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen,"

00:00:17.103 --> 00:00:19.833
as this was not a Disney-sanctioned event.

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:24.433
These two entrepreneurs had
a business of running princess parties.

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.017
Your kid is turning five?

00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:29.544
They'll come sing some songs,
sprinkle some fairy dust, it's great.

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:33.168
And they were not about
to miss out on the opportunity

00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:35.803
that was the phenomenon
and that was "Frozen."

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:37.700
So they get hired by a local toy store,

00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:39.457
kids come in on a Saturday morning,

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:42.557
buy some Disney swag, get their
picture taken with the princesses,

00:00:42.557 --> 00:00:44.160
call it a day.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.856
It's like Santa Claus
without the seasonal restrictions.

00:00:46.857 --> 00:00:48.462
(Laughter)

00:00:48.463 --> 00:00:53.550
And my three-and-a-half-year-old niece
Samantha was in the thick of it.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.672
She could care less that these two women
were signing posters and coloring books

00:00:58.672 --> 00:01:03.956
as Snow Queen and Princess Ana
with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits.

00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:05.122
(Laughter)

00:01:05.123 --> 00:01:09.818
According to my niece and the 200-plus
kids in the parking lot that day,

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:14.542
this was the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."

00:01:15.955 --> 00:01:21.597
It is a blazing hot Saturday morning
in August in Ohio.

00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:24.872
We get there at 10 o'clock,
the scheduled start time,

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:27.105
and we are handed number 59.

00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:31.673
By 11 o'clock they had called
numbers 21 through 25;

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:33.426
this was going to be a while,

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:37.891
and there is no amount
of free face painting or temporary tattoos

00:01:37.892 --> 00:01:41.396
that could prevent the meltdowns
that were occurring outside of the store.

00:01:41.397 --> 00:01:42.971
(Laughter)

00:01:42.972 --> 00:01:47.113
So, by 12:30 we get called:

00:01:47.114 --> 00:01:50.306
"56 to 63, please."

00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:53.677
And as we walk in, it is a scene
I can only describe you

00:01:53.678 --> 00:01:56.567
as saying it looked like Norway threw up.

00:01:56.568 --> 00:01:57.947
(Laughter)

00:01:57.948 --> 00:02:02.333
There were cardboard
cut-out snowflakes covering the floor,

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:07.252
glitter on every flat surface,
and icicles all over the walls.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.063
And as we stood in line

00:02:09.063 --> 00:02:11.596
in an attempt to give
my niece a better vantage point

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:14.151
than the backside
of the mother of number 58,

00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:15.879
I put her up on my shoulders,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.978
and she was instantly riveted
by the sight of the princesses.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.519
And as we moved forward,
her excitement only grew,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.804
and as we finally got
to the front of the line,

00:02:24.804 --> 00:02:28.497
and number 58 unfurled her poster
to be signed by the princesses,

00:02:28.498 --> 00:02:32.097
I could literally feel the excitement
running through her body.

00:02:32.098 --> 00:02:35.062
And let's be honest,
at that point, I was pretty excited too.

00:02:35.063 --> 00:02:36.457
(Laughter)

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:39.456
I mean, the Scandinavian decadence
was mesmerizing.

00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:40.625
(Laughter)

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:42.535
So we get to the front of the line,

00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:45.545
and the haggard clerk
turns to my niece and says,

00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:47.365
"Hi, honey. You're next!

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:49.655
Do you want to get down,
or you're going to stay

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:51.912
on your dad's shoulders for the picture?'

00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:53.399
(Laughter)

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.261
And I was, for a lack
of a better word, frozen.

00:02:57.262 --> 00:02:58.873
(Laughter)

00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:03.666
It's amazing that in an unexpected instant
we are faced with the question,

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:04.997
who am I?

00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:08.465
Am I an aunt? Or am I an advocate?

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:12.296
Millions of people have seen my video
about how to have a hard conversation,

00:03:12.297 --> 00:03:14.613
and there one was, right in front of me.

00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:15.685
At the same time,

00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:18.595
there's nothing more important
to me than the kids in my life,

00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:22.543
so I found myself in a situation
that we so often find ourselves in,

00:03:22.544 --> 00:03:25.766
torn between two things,
two impossible choices.

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:27.793
Would I be an advocate?

00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:32.341
Would I take my niece off my shoulders
and turn to the clerk and explain to her

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:35.479
that I was in fact
her aunt, not her father,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.848
and that she should be more careful

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.604
and not to jump to gender conclusions
based on haircuts and shoulder rides --

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:43.740
(Laughter) --

00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:45.597
and while doing that,

00:03:45.598 --> 00:03:50.386
miss out on what was, to this point,
the greatest moment of my niece's life.

00:03:51.116 --> 00:03:53.205
Or would I be an aunt?

00:03:53.206 --> 00:03:56.343
Would I brush off that comment,
take a million pictures,

00:03:56.344 --> 00:04:01.321
and not be distracted for an instant
from the pure joy of that moment,

00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:02.840
and by doing that,

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:06.223
walk out with the shame that comes up
for not standing up for myself,

00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:08.606
especially in front of my niece.

00:04:08.607 --> 00:04:10.409
Who was I?

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.228
Which one was more important?
Which role was more worth it?

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.218
Was I an aunt? Or was I an advocate?

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.435
And I had a split second to decide.

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:23.813
We are taught right now

00:04:23.814 --> 00:04:28.112
that we are living in a world
of constant and increasing polarity.

00:04:28.113 --> 00:04:32.684
It's so black and white,
so us and them, so right and wrong.

00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:37.691
There is no middle,
there is no gray, just polarity.

00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:40.131
Polarity is a state in which
two ideas or opinions

00:04:40.132 --> 00:04:42.712
are completely opposite from each other;

00:04:42.712 --> 00:04:44.866
a diametrical opposition.

00:04:46.127 --> 00:04:48.581
Which side are you on?

00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:52.646
Are you unequivocally and without question
antiwar, pro-choice, anti-death penalty,

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:56.104
pro-gun regulation, proponent
of open borders and pro-union?

00:04:56.104 --> 00:05:01.337
Or, are you absolutely 
and uncompromisingly

00:05:01.337 --> 00:05:03.522
pro-war, pro-life, pro-death penalty,


00:05:03.522 --> 00:05:05.838
a believer that the Second
Amendment is absolute,

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.542
anti-immigrant and pro-business?

00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:09.787
It's all or none, you're with us
or against us.

00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:11.507
That is polarity.

00:05:12.247 --> 00:05:17.190
The problem with polarity 
and absolutes is that

00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:22.355
it eliminates the individuality
of our human experience

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:26.381
and that makes it contradictory
to our human nature.

00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:29.297
But if we are pulled
in these two directions,

00:05:29.297 --> 00:05:31.077
but it's not really where we exist --

00:05:31.077 --> 00:05:33.507
polarity is not our actual reality --

00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:34.887
where do we go from there?

00:05:34.887 --> 00:05:38.367
What's at the other end of that spectrum?

00:05:38.368 --> 00:05:42.407
I don't think it's an unattainable,
harmonious utopia,

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.841
I think the opposite
of polarity is duality.

00:05:45.842 --> 00:05:48.446
Duality is a state of having two parts,

00:05:48.446 --> 00:05:51.729
but not in diametrical opposition,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.675
in simultaneous existence.

00:05:54.676 --> 00:05:56.662
Don't think it's possible?

00:05:56.663 --> 00:05:58.333
Here are the people I know:

00:05:58.334 --> 00:06:01.497
I know Catholics who are pro-choice,
and feminists who wear hijabs,

00:06:01.497 --> 00:06:03.201
and veterans who are antiwar,

00:06:03.202 --> 00:06:05.986
and NRA members who think
I should be able to get married.

00:06:05.987 --> 00:06:09.022
Those are the people I know,
those are my friends and family,

00:06:09.023 --> 00:06:11.999
that is the majority of our society,
that is you, that is me.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.657
(Applause)

00:06:20.717 --> 00:06:25.885
Duality is the ability
to hold both things.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:30.007
But the question is:
Can we own our duality?

00:06:30.008 --> 00:06:33.730
Can we have the courage
to hold both things?

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.422
I work at a restaurant in town,

00:06:36.422 --> 00:06:39.032
I became really good friends
with the busser.

00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:42.050
I was a server and we had 
a great relationship,

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.990
we had a really great time together.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.608
Her Spanish was great

00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:49.450
because she was from Mexico.

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.312
(Laughter)

00:06:51.313 --> 00:06:53.746
That line actually went the other way.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.668
Her English was limited,
but significantly better than my Spanish.

00:06:59.848 --> 00:07:03.677
But we were united by our similarities,

00:07:03.678 --> 00:07:06.578
not separated by our differences.

00:07:06.578 --> 00:07:09.698
And we were close, even though
we came from very different worlds.

00:07:09.698 --> 00:07:10.838
She was from Mexico,


00:07:10.838 --> 00:07:14.169
she left her family behind
so she could come here

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:16.149
and afford them a better life back home.

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:19.106
She was a devout conservative Catholic,

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:21.826
a believer in traditional family values,

00:07:21.826 --> 00:07:23.932
stereotypical roles of men and women,

00:07:23.933 --> 00:07:26.727
and I was, well, me.

00:07:26.728 --> 00:07:28.632
(Laughter)

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:32.318
But the things that bonded us
were when she asked about my girlfriend,

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:35.787
or she shared pictures that she had
from her family back home.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:38.415
Those were the things
that brought us together.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.002
So one day, we were in the back,

00:07:40.003 --> 00:07:43.682
scarfing down food as quickly as we could,
gathered around a small table,

00:07:43.683 --> 00:07:45.313
during a very rare lull,

00:07:45.313 --> 00:07:47.323
and a new guy
from the kitchen came over --

00:07:47.323 --> 00:07:48.985
who happened to be her cousin --

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:51.787
and sat down with all
the bravado and machismo

00:07:51.788 --> 00:07:53.949
that his 20-year-old body could hold.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.771
(Laughter)

00:07:55.772 --> 00:08:00.744
And he said to her,
[in Spanish] "Does Ash have a boyfriend?"

00:08:01.904 --> 00:08:05.856
And she said,
[in Spanish] "No, she has a girlfriend."

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:10.911
And he said,
[in Spanish] "A girlfriend?!?"

00:08:10.912 --> 00:08:14.024
And she set down her fork,
and locked eyes with him,

00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:19.047
and said, [in Spanish] "Yes,
a girlfriend. That is all."

00:08:19.048 --> 00:08:23.940
And his smug smile quickly dropped
to one of maternal respect,

00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:27.143
grabbed his plate, walked off,
went back to work.

00:08:27.144 --> 00:08:28.878
She never made eye contact with me.

00:08:29.668 --> 00:08:31.383
She left, did the same thing --

00:08:31.384 --> 00:08:34.654
it was a 10-second conversation,
such a short interaction.

00:08:34.655 --> 00:08:37.191
And on paper, she had
so much more in common with him:

00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:42.289
language, culture, history, family,
her community was her lifeline here,

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.460
but her moral compass trumped all of that.

00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:50.123
And a little bit later, they were joking
around in the kitchen in Spanish,

00:08:50.124 --> 00:08:52.024
that had nothing to do with me,

00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:54.469
and that is duality.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.983
She didn't have to choose some P.C. stance
on gayness over her heritage.

00:08:58.983 --> 00:09:02.133
She didn't have to choose
her family over our friendship.

00:09:02.134 --> 00:09:04.408
It wasn't Jesus or Ash.

00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:06.376
(Laughter)

00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:10.493
(Applause)

00:09:15.183 --> 00:09:19.760
Her individual morality
was so strongly rooted

00:09:19.761 --> 00:09:23.142
that she had the courage
to hold both things.

00:09:23.143 --> 00:09:26.324
Our moral integrity is our responsibility

00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:30.556
and we must be prepared to defend it
even when it's not convenient.

00:09:30.557 --> 00:09:33.870
That's what it means to be an ally,
and if you're going to be an ally,

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.157
you have to be an active ally:

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:40.045
Ask questions, act when you hear
something inappropriate,

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:42.074
actually engage.

00:09:42.075 --> 00:09:46.508
I had a family friend who for years
used to call my girlfriend my lover.

00:09:48.531 --> 00:09:50.975
Really? Lover?

00:09:50.976 --> 00:09:53.000
So overly sexual,

00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:55.046
so '70s gay porn.

00:09:55.047 --> 00:09:56.253
(Laughter)

00:09:59.293 --> 00:10:01.788
But she was trying, and she asked.

00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:03.572
She could have called her my friend,

00:10:03.573 --> 00:10:07.707
or my "friend," or my "special friend" --

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:09.092
(Laughter) --

00:10:09.093 --> 00:10:12.058
or even worse, just not asked at all.

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:15.689
Believe me, we would rather have you ask.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.931
I would rather have her say lover,
than say nothing at all.

00:10:20.932 --> 00:10:23.963
People often say to me,
"Well, Ash, I don't care.

00:10:23.964 --> 00:10:27.756
I don't see race
or religion or sexuality.

00:10:27.757 --> 00:10:30.600
It doesn't matter to me. I don't see it."

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:37.244
But I think the opposite of homophobia
and racism and xenophobia is not love,

00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:38.858
it's apathy.

00:10:38.859 --> 00:10:42.962
If you don't see my gayness,
then you don't see me.

00:10:42.963 --> 00:10:45.948
If it doesn't matter to you
who I sleep with,

00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:48.134
then you cannot imagine what it feels like

00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:51.011
when I walk down the street
late at night holding her hand,

00:10:51.011 --> 00:10:53.829
and approach a group of people
and have to make the decision

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:56.174
if I should hang on to it
or if I should I drop it

00:10:56.175 --> 00:10:58.493
when all I want to do
is squeeze it tighter.

00:10:58.494 --> 00:11:01.011
And the small victory I feel

00:11:01.012 --> 00:11:03.719
when I make it by
and don't have to let go.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.838
And the incredible cowardice
and disappointment I feel when I drop it.

00:11:08.839 --> 00:11:10.787
If you do not see that struggle

00:11:10.788 --> 00:11:17.263
that is unique to my human experience
because I am gay, then you don't see me.

00:11:17.264 --> 00:11:22.678
If you are going to be an ally,
I need you to see me.

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:25.622
As individuals, as allies, as humans,


00:11:25.622 --> 00:11:28.622
we need to be able to hold both things:

00:11:28.622 --> 00:11:31.070
both the good and the bad,


00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.900
the easy and the hard.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:37.371
You don't learn how to hold
two things just from the fluff,

00:11:37.372 --> 00:11:39.773
you learn it from the grit.

00:11:39.774 --> 00:11:43.158
And what if duality
is just the first step?

00:11:44.308 --> 00:11:49.137
What if through compassion
and empathy and human interaction

00:11:49.138 --> 00:11:51.532
we are able to learn to hold two things?

00:11:51.533 --> 00:11:53.847
And if we can hold
two things, we can hold four,

00:11:53.848 --> 00:11:55.858
and if we can hold four,
we can hold eight,

00:11:55.859 --> 00:11:58.099
and if we can hold eight,
we can hold hundreds.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.562
We are complex individuals,


00:12:00.562 --> 00:12:02.362
swirls of contradiction.

00:12:02.362 --> 00:12:04.967
You are all holding
so many things right now.

00:12:05.888 --> 00:12:09.330
What can you do to hold just a few more?

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.237
So, back to Toledo, Ohio.

00:12:12.237 --> 00:12:14.417
I'm at the front of the line,

00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:18.519
niece on my shoulders,
the frazzled clerk calls me Dad.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.080
Have you ever been mistaken
for the wrong gender?

00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:25.309
Not even that.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.759
Have you ever been called
something you are not?

00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:34.039
Here's what it feels like for me:

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.113
I am instantly an internal storm
of contrasting emotions.

00:12:38.114 --> 00:12:43.656
I break out into a sweat that is
a combination of rage and humiliation,

00:12:43.657 --> 00:12:46.617
I feel like the entire store
is staring at me,

00:12:46.618 --> 00:12:49.178
and I simultaneously feel invisible.

00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:52.122
I want to explode in a tirade of fury,

00:12:52.123 --> 00:12:54.716
and I want to crawl under a rock.

00:12:54.717 --> 00:12:57.819
And top all of that off
with the frustration that I'm wearing

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.418
an out-of-character
tight-fitting purple t-shirt,

00:13:01.418 --> 00:13:03.456
so this whole store can see my boobs,

00:13:03.456 --> 00:13:06.457
to make sure this exact
same thing doesn't happen.

00:13:06.458 --> 00:13:08.640
(Laughter)

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.962
But, despite my best efforts
to be seen as the gender I am,

00:13:12.962 --> 00:13:14.803
it still happens.

00:13:14.804 --> 00:13:19.496
And I hope with every ounce
of my body that no one heard --

00:13:19.497 --> 00:13:24.050
not my sister, not my girlfriend,
and certainly not my niece.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.491
I am accustomed to this familiar hurt,

00:13:26.491 --> 00:13:30.566
but I will do whatever I need to do
to protect the people I love from it.

00:13:31.906 --> 00:13:34.440
But then I take my niece off my shoulders,

00:13:34.441 --> 00:13:36.615
and she runs to Elsa and Anna --

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:39.182
the thing she's been
waiting so long for --

00:13:39.183 --> 00:13:41.270
and all that stuff goes away.


00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.980
All that matters is the smile on her face.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:50.637
And as the 30 seconds we waited
two and a half hours for comes to a close

00:13:50.638 --> 00:13:55.841
we gather up our things,
and I lock eyes with the clerk again;

00:13:55.842 --> 00:13:58.978
and she gives me
an apologetic smile and mouths,

00:13:58.979 --> 00:14:01.275
"I am so sorry!"

00:14:01.276 --> 00:14:03.385
(Laughter)

00:14:03.386 --> 00:14:09.242
And her humanity, her willingness to admit
her mistake disarms me immediately,

00:14:09.243 --> 00:14:14.415
then I give her a: "It's okay,
it happens. But thanks."

00:14:14.416 --> 00:14:17.406
And I realize in that moment

00:14:17.407 --> 00:14:19.444
that I don't have to be

00:14:19.445 --> 00:14:23.643
either an aunt
or an advocate, I can be both.

00:14:24.903 --> 00:14:30.251
I can live in duality,
and I can hold two things.

00:14:30.252 --> 00:14:33.189
And if I can hold two things
in that environment,

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.542
I can hold so many more things.

00:14:35.543 --> 00:14:39.295
As my girlfriend and my niece hold hands
and skip out the front of the door,

00:14:39.296 --> 00:14:42.039
I turn to my sister and say,
"Was it worth it?"

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.814
And she said, "Are you kidding me?

00:14:43.815 --> 00:14:47.702
Did you see the look on her face?
This was the greatest day of her life!"

00:14:47.703 --> 00:14:48.800
(Laughter)

00:14:48.801 --> 00:14:51.758
"It was worth the two
and a half hours in the heat,

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:56.146
it was worth the overpriced coloring book
that we already had a copy of."

00:14:56.147 --> 00:14:57.854
(Laughter)

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:01.509
"It was even worth you 
getting called Dad."

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.615
(Laughter)

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:10.919
And for the first time ever
in my life, it actually was.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.098
Thank you, Boulder. Have a good night.

00:15:13.099 --> 00:15:14.619
(Applause)
