00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:04.014
An evolutionary biologist
at Purdue University

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:07.160
named William Muir studied chickens.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.249
He was interested in productivity --

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.539
I think it's something
that concerns all of us --

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.827
but it's easy to measure in chickens
because you just count the eggs.

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.527
(Laughter)

00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:19.944
He wanted to know what could make
his chickens more productive,

00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:22.870
so he devised a beautiful experiment.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.328
Chickens live in groups, so first of all,
he selected just an average flock,

00:00:27.328 --> 00:00:30.718
and he let it alone for six generations.

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:32.807
But then he created a second group

00:00:32.807 --> 00:00:35.315
of the individually
most productive chickens --

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:38.270
you could call them superchickens --

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.377
and he put them together in a superflock,

00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:45.075
and each generation, he selected
only the most productive for breeding.

00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:47.969
After six generations had passed,

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.717
what did he find?

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:53.548
Well, the first group, the average group,
was doing just fine.

00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:56.074
They were all plump and fully feathered

00:00:56.074 --> 00:00:58.352
and egg production
had increased dramatically.

00:00:58.702 --> 00:01:00.559
What about the second group?

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:03.293
Well, all but three were dead.

00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:06.413
They'd pecked the rest to death.

00:01:06.413 --> 00:01:07.990
(Laughter)

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.501
The individually productive chickens
had only achieved their success

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:18.164
by suppressing the productivity
of the rest.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.525
Now, as I've gone around the world
talking about this and telling this story

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:24.777
in all sorts of organizations
and companies,

00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:27.353
people have seen
the relevance almost instantly,

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.659
and they come up and they say
things to me like,

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.750
"That superflock, that's my company."

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.715
(Laughter)

00:01:34.715 --> 00:01:38.226
Or, "That's my country."

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:40.318
Or, "That's my life."

00:01:40.798 --> 00:01:44.722
All my life I've been told that the way
we have to get ahead is to compete:

00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:48.754
get into the right school,
get into the right job, get to the top,

00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:52.492
and I've really never found it
very inspiring.

00:01:52.492 --> 00:01:57.275
I've started and run businesses
because invention is a joy,

00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:00.595
and because working alongside
brilliant, creative people

00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:02.075
is its own reward.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:08.397
And I've never really felt very motivated
by pecking orders or by superchickens

00:02:08.397 --> 00:02:10.966
or by superstars.

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:13.220
But for the past 50 years,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.452
we've run most organizations
and some societies

00:02:17.452 --> 00:02:19.770
along the superchicken model.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.582
We've thought that success is achieved
by picking the superstars,

00:02:23.582 --> 00:02:27.731
the brightest men,
or occasionally women, in the room,

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:31.090
and giving them all the resources
and all the power.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.493
And the result has been just the same
as in William Muir's experiment:

00:02:35.493 --> 00:02:40.462
aggression, dysfunction and waste.

00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:44.572
If the only way the most productive
can be successful

00:02:44.572 --> 00:02:47.753
is by suppressing
the productivity of the rest,

00:02:47.753 --> 00:02:51.236
then we badly need to find
a better way to work

00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:54.010
and a richer way to live.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.921
(Applause)

00:02:58.921 --> 00:03:02.915
So what is it that makes some groups

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:06.390
obviously more successful
and more productive than others?

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.974
Well, that's the question
a team at MIT took to research.

00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:12.400
They brought in hundreds of volunteers,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.894
they put them into groups, and they
gave them very hard problems to solve.

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:18.625
And what happened was exactly
what you'd expect,

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.931
that some groups were very much
more successful than others,

00:03:21.931 --> 00:03:25.461
but what was really interesting
was that the high-achieving groups

00:03:25.461 --> 00:03:28.108
were not those where they had
one or two people

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:31.149
with spectacularly high I.Q.

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.748
Nor were the most successful groups
the ones that had the highest

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:37.117
aggregate I.Q.

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:42.991
Instead, they had three characteristics,
the really successful teams.

00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:48.633
First of all, they showed high degrees
of social sensitivity to each other.

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:52.232
This is measured by something called
the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.717
It's broadly considered
a test for empathy,

00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:56.914
and the groups that scored highly on this

00:03:56.914 --> 00:03:58.864
did better.

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:03.972
Secondly, the successful groups
gave roughly equal time to each other,

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:06.317
so that no one voice dominated,

00:04:06.317 --> 00:04:09.103
but neither were there any passengers.

00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:11.820
And thirdly, the more successful groups

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.165
had more women in them.

00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:16.162
(Applause)

00:04:16.162 --> 00:04:20.437
Now, was this because women
typically score more highly on

00:04:20.437 --> 00:04:22.310
the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.037
so you're getting a doubling down
on the empathy quotient?

00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:27.795
Or was it because they brought
a more diverse perspective?

00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:31.951
We don't really know, but the striking
thing about this experiment

00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:36.380
is that it showed what we know, which is
some groups do better than others,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.731
but what's key to that

00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:42.378
is their social connectedness
to each other.

00:04:43.543 --> 00:04:46.375
So how does this play out
in the real world?

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:51.716
Well, it means that what happens
between people really counts,

00:04:51.716 --> 00:04:55.524
because in groups that are highly
attuned and sensitive to each other,

00:04:55.524 --> 00:04:58.780
ideas can flow and grow.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.768
People don't get stuck.
They don't waste energy down dead ends.

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:07.482
An example: Arup is one of the world's
most successful engineering firms,

00:05:07.482 --> 00:05:10.134
and it was commissioned to build
the equestrian center

00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:12.000
for the Beijing Olympics.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.826
Now, this building had to receive

00:05:13.826 --> 00:05:19.120
two and a half thousand
really highly strung thoroughbred horses

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.209
that were coming off long-haul flights,

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:24.692
highly jet-lagged,
not feeling their finest.

00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:28.104
And the problem
the engineer confronted was,

00:05:28.104 --> 00:05:31.780
what quantity of waste to cater for?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.184
Now, you don't get taught this
in engineering school -- (Laughter) --

00:05:37.184 --> 00:05:40.388
and it's not really the kind of thing
you want to get wrong,

00:05:40.388 --> 00:05:43.853
so he could have spent months
talking to vets, doing the research,

00:05:43.853 --> 00:05:45.654
tweaking the spreadsheet.

00:05:45.654 --> 00:05:48.799
Instead, he asked for help

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:53.285
and he found someone who had designed
the Jockey Club in New York.

00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:57.404
The problem was solved in less than a day.

00:05:57.404 --> 00:06:00.191
Arup believes that
the culture of helpfulness

00:06:00.191 --> 00:06:02.959
is central to their success.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.400
Now, helpfulness sounds really anemic,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.498
but it's absolutely core
to successful teams,

00:06:11.498 --> 00:06:16.707
and it routinely outperforms
individual intelligence.

00:06:17.117 --> 00:06:20.322
Helpfulness means I don't
have to know everything,

00:06:20.322 --> 00:06:25.600
I just have to work among people
who are good at getting and giving help.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.361
At SAP, they reckon that you can answer
any question in 17 minutes.

00:06:32.131 --> 00:06:35.126
But there isn't a single
high-tech company I've worked with

00:06:35.126 --> 00:06:40.571
that imagines for a moment
that this is a technology issue,

00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:45.041
because what drives helpfulness
is people getting to know each other.

00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:50.782
Now that sounds so obvious, and we think
it'll just happen normally,

00:06:50.782 --> 00:06:52.410
but it doesn't.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.704
When I was running
my first software company,

00:06:55.704 --> 00:06:57.738
I realized that we were getting stuck.

00:06:57.738 --> 00:07:01.523
There was a lot of friction,
but not much else,

00:07:01.523 --> 00:07:06.399
and I gradually realized the brilliant,
creative people that I'd hired

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.364
didn't know each other.

00:07:08.364 --> 00:07:12.241
They were so focused
on their own individual work,

00:07:12.241 --> 00:07:15.970
they didn't even know
who they were sitting next to,

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.541
and it was only when I insisted
that we stop working

00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:21.125
and invest time in getting
to know each other

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:24.223
that we achieved real momentum.

00:07:24.813 --> 00:07:27.409
Now, that was 20 years ago,
and now I visit companies

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:30.311
that have banned coffee cups at desks

00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:34.305
because they want people to hang out
around the coffee machines

00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:36.139
and talk to each other.

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.647
The Swedes even have
a special term for this.

00:07:38.647 --> 00:07:42.007
They call it fika, which means
more than a coffee break.

00:07:42.007 --> 00:07:45.613
It means collective restoration.

00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:48.724
At Idexx, a company up in Maine,

00:07:48.724 --> 00:07:51.516
they've created vegetable gardens
on campus so that people

00:07:51.516 --> 00:07:53.768
from different parts of the business

00:07:53.768 --> 00:07:58.644
can work together and get to know
the whole business that way.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.989
Have they all gone mad?

00:08:00.989 --> 00:08:04.542
Quite the opposite -- they've figured out
that when the going gets tough,

00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:06.585
and it always will get tough

00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:09.301
if you're doing breakthrough work
that really matters,

00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:11.972
what people need is social support,

00:08:11.972 --> 00:08:15.199
and they need to know who to ask for help.

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:19.936
Companies don't have ideas;
only people do.

00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:22.536
And what motivates people

00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:27.030
are the bonds and loyalty and trust
they develop between each other.

00:08:27.566 --> 00:08:31.260
What matters is the mortar,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.549
not just the bricks.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.273
Now, when you put all of this together,

00:08:36.273 --> 00:08:39.431
what you get is something
called social capital.

00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:44.980
Social capital is the reliance
and interdependency that builds trust.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.471
The term comes from sociologists
who were studying communities

00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:52.739
that proved particularly resilient
in times of stress.

00:08:53.409 --> 00:08:57.960
Social capital is what
gives companies momentum,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.222
and social capital
is what makes companies robust.

00:09:04.182 --> 00:09:06.442
What does this mean in practical terms?

00:09:06.852 --> 00:09:10.759
It means that time is everything,

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:15.426
because social capital
compounds with time.

00:09:15.426 --> 00:09:20.534
So teams that work together longer
get better, because it takes time

00:09:20.534 --> 00:09:26.041
to develop the trust you need
for real candor and openness.

00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:29.925
And time is what builds value.

00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:32.878
When Alex Pentland
suggested to one company

00:09:32.878 --> 00:09:35.594
that they synchronize coffee breaks

00:09:35.594 --> 00:09:39.495
so that people would have time
to talk to each other,

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:42.978
profits went up 15 million dollars,

00:09:42.978 --> 00:09:46.832
and employee satisfaction
went up 10 percent.

00:09:46.832 --> 00:09:49.933
Not a bad return on social capital,

00:09:49.933 --> 00:09:53.960
which compounds even as you spend it.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:00.022
Now, this isn't about chumminess,
and it's no charter for slackers,

00:10:00.022 --> 00:10:04.656
because people who work this way
tend to be kind of scratchy,

00:10:04.656 --> 00:10:08.690
impatient, absolutely determined
to think for themselves

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.680
because that's what their contribution is.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.979
Conflict is frequent
because candor is safe.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:23.471
And that's how good ideas
turn into great ideas,

00:10:23.471 --> 00:10:26.571
because no idea is born fully formed.

00:10:26.571 --> 00:10:29.900
It emerges a little bit
as a child is born,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.489
kind of messy and confused,
but full of possibilities.

00:10:34.489 --> 00:10:40.610
And it's only through the generous
contribution, faith and challenge

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.892
that they achieve their potential.

00:10:43.892 --> 00:10:47.955
And that's what social capital supports.

00:10:49.455 --> 00:10:52.228
Now, we aren't really used
to talking about this,

00:10:52.228 --> 00:10:56.198
about talent, about creativity,
in this way.

00:10:56.198 --> 00:10:59.932
We're used to talking about stars.

00:11:00.262 --> 00:11:04.371
So I started to wonder,
well, if we start working this way,

00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:06.595
does that mean no more stars?

00:11:07.445 --> 00:11:09.805
So I went and I sat in on the auditions

00:11:09.805 --> 00:11:13.661
at the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Art in London.

00:11:13.661 --> 00:11:16.886
And what I saw there really surprised me,

00:11:16.886 --> 00:11:21.786
because the teachers weren't looking
for individual pyrotechnics.

00:11:21.786 --> 00:11:26.476
They were looking for what happened
between the students,

00:11:26.476 --> 00:11:30.586
because that's where the drama is.

00:11:30.586 --> 00:11:32.875
And when I talked
to producers of hit albums,

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:36.103
they said, "Oh sure, we have
lots of superstars in music.

00:11:36.103 --> 00:11:39.220
It's just, they don't last very long.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.220
It's the outstanding collaborators
who enjoy the long careers,

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.432
because bringing out the best in others
is how they found the best

00:11:47.432 --> 00:11:49.076
in themselves."

00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:52.115
And when I went to visit companies
that are renowned

00:11:52.115 --> 00:11:54.182
for their ingenuity and creativity,

00:11:54.182 --> 00:11:57.107
I couldn't even see any superstars,

00:11:57.107 --> 00:12:01.445
because everybody there really mattered.

00:12:01.445 --> 00:12:04.328
And when I reflected on my own career,

00:12:04.328 --> 00:12:08.252
and the extraordinary people
I've had the privilege to work with,

00:12:08.252 --> 00:12:13.796
I realized how much more
we could give each other

00:12:13.796 --> 00:12:18.917
if we just stopped trying
to be superchickens.

00:12:19.815 --> 00:12:24.970
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:31.346
Once you appreciate
truly how social work is,

00:12:31.346 --> 00:12:34.443
a lot of things have to change.

00:12:34.443 --> 00:12:38.530
Management by talent contest
has routinely pitted

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.991
employees against each other.

00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:45.505
Now, rivalry has to be replaced
by social capital.

00:12:46.355 --> 00:12:49.480
For decades, we've tried
to motivate people with money,

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.360
even though we've got
a vast amount of research that shows

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.191
that money erodes social connectedness.

00:12:56.851 --> 00:13:02.186
Now, we need to let people
motivate each other.

00:13:02.646 --> 00:13:07.570
And for years, we've thought that leaders
were heroic soloists who were expected,

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.726
all by themselves,
to solve complex problems.

00:13:10.726 --> 00:13:14.278
Now, we need to redefine leadership

00:13:14.278 --> 00:13:18.342
as an activity in which
conditions are created

00:13:18.342 --> 00:13:24.300
in which everyone can do their most
courageous thinking together.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.820
We know that this works.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:32.505
When the Montreal Protocol called
for the phasing out of CFCs,

00:13:32.505 --> 00:13:36.847
the chlorofluorocarbons implicated
in the hole in the ozone layer,

00:13:36.847 --> 00:13:39.032
the risks were immense.

00:13:39.332 --> 00:13:42.231
CFCs were everywhere,

00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:44.780
and nobody knew if a substitute
could be found.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.671
But one team that rose to the challenge
adopted three key principles.

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:54.647
The first was the head of engineering,
Frank Maslen, said,

00:13:54.647 --> 00:13:57.980
there will be no stars in this team.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.257
We need everybody.

00:14:00.257 --> 00:14:02.985
Everybody has a valid perspective.

00:14:03.485 --> 00:14:07.711
Second, we work to one standard only:

00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:10.310
the best imaginable.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.632
And third, he told his boss,
Geoff Tudhope,

00:14:13.632 --> 00:14:15.605
that he had to butt out,

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.856
because he knew
how disruptive power can be.

00:14:18.856 --> 00:14:21.689
Now, this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing.

00:14:21.689 --> 00:14:23.430
He gave the team air cover,

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.540
and he listened to ensure
that they honored their principles.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:34.260
And it worked: Ahead of all the other
companies tackling this hard problem,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.518
this group cracked it first.

00:14:37.738 --> 00:14:40.339
And to date, the Montreal Protocol

00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:46.060
is the most successful international
environmental agreement

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.982
ever implemented.

00:14:49.402 --> 00:14:51.940
There was a lot at stake then,

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.679
and there's a lot at stake now,

00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:59.207
and we won't solve our problems
if we expect it to be solved

00:14:59.207 --> 00:15:01.808
by a few supermen or superwomen.

00:15:01.808 --> 00:15:05.314
Now we need everybody,

00:15:05.314 --> 00:15:11.540
because it is only when we accept
that everybody has value

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:18.586
that we will liberate the energy
and imagination and momentum we need

00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:23.360
to create the best beyond measure.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.100
Thank you.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.100
(Applause)
