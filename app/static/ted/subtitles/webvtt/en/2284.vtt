WEBVTT

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:02.808
I am failing as a woman,

00:00:02.832 --> 00:00:05.127
I am failing as a feminist.

00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:08.229
I have passionate opinions
about gender equality,

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:12.290
but I worry that to freely accept
the label of "feminist,"

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:14.613
would not be fair to good feminists.

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:17.557
I'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one.

00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:20.445
Oh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:22.802
Or at least, I wrote an essay,

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:25.001
and then I wrote a book
called "Bad Feminist,"

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:28.461
and then in interviews, people started
calling me The Bad Feminist.

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:29.651
(Laughter)

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:33.712
So, what started as a bit
of an inside joke with myself

00:00:33.736 --> 00:00:35.417
and a willful provocation,

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:37.091
has become a thing.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.456
Let me take a step back.

00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:41.312
When I was younger,

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:43.249
mostly in my teens and 20s,

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:45.678
I had strange ideas about feminists

00:00:45.702 --> 00:00:49.478
as hairy, angry, man-hating,
sex-hating women --

00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:51.081
as if those are bad things.

00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:53.834
(Laughter)

00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:58.416
These days, I look at how
women are treated the world over,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.726
and anger, in particular, seems
like a perfectly reasonable response.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.495
But back then,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.322
I worried about the tone people used


00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:09.322
when suggesting I might be a feminist.

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:11.880
The feminist label was an accusation,

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:14.293
it was an "F" word, and not a nice one.

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:17.658
I was labeled a woman
who doesn't play by the rules,

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:19.303
who expects too much,

00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:21.320
who thinks far too highly of myself,

00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:25.458
by daring to believe I'm equal --
(Coughs) -- superior to a man.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.885
You don't want to be that rebel woman,

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.394
until you realize that you
very much are that woman,

00:01:30.418 --> 00:01:32.915
and cannot imagine being anyone else.

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:35.364
As I got older, I began to accept

00:01:35.388 --> 00:01:38.721
that I am, indeed, a feminist,
and a proud one.

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:41.539
I hold certain truths to be self-evident:

00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:44.015
Women are equal to men.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.820
We deserve equal pay for equal work.

00:01:46.844 --> 00:01:49.828
We have the right to move
through the world as we choose,

00:01:49.852 --> 00:01:51.819
free from harassment or violence.

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:55.787
We have the right to easy,
affordable access to birth control,

00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:57.708
and reproductive services.

00:01:57.732 --> 00:02:00.303
We have the right to make choices
about our bodies,

00:02:00.327 --> 00:02:04.480
free from legislative oversight
or evangelical doctrine.

00:02:04.504 --> 00:02:05.988
We have the right to respect.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:07.885
There's more.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.124
When we talk about the needs of women,

00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:13.553
we have to consider
the other identities we inhabit.

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:15.034
We are not just women.

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:17.365
We are people with different bodies,

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.404
gender expressions, faiths, sexualities,

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:23.319
class backgrounds, abilities,
and so much more.

00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:25.105
We need to take into account

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.565
these differences and how they affect us,

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.291
as much as we account for
what we have in common.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.299
Without this kind of inclusion,
our feminism is nothing.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.871
I hold these truths to be self-evident,
but let me be clear:

00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:40.032
I'm a mess.

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:42.313
I am full of contradictions.

00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:45.257
There are many ways in which
I'm doing feminism wrong.

00:02:45.876 --> 00:02:47.392
I have another confession.

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:51.752
When I drive to work, I listen
to thuggish rap at a very loud volume.

00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:53.283
(Laughter)

00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:55.636
Even though the lyrics
are degrading to women --

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.455
these lyrics offend me to my core --

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.479
the classic Yin Yang Twins
song "Salt Shaker" --

00:03:01.503 --> 00:03:02.955
it is amazing.

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.445
(Laughter)

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.397
"Make it work with your wet t-shirt.

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:12.181
Bitch, you gotta shake it
'til your camel starts to hurt!"

00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:13.363
(Laughter)

00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:14.412
Think about it.

00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:17.324
(Laughter)

00:03:17.348 --> 00:03:18.666
Poetry, right?

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.350
I am utterly mortified
by my music choices.

00:03:22.374 --> 00:03:24.286
(Laughter)

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.594
I firmly believe in man work,

00:03:26.618 --> 00:03:29.027
which is anything I don't
want to do, including --

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:30.932
(Laughter) --

00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:33.110
all domestic tasks,

00:03:33.134 --> 00:03:37.443
but also: bug killing, trash removal,
lawn care and vehicle maintenance.

00:03:38.014 --> 00:03:39.881
I want no part of any of that.

00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:40.978
(Laughter)

00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:42.899
Pink is my favorite color.

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:45.951
I enjoy fashion magazines
and pretty things.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.278
I watch "The Bachelor"
and romantic comedies,

00:03:48.302 --> 00:03:51.409
and I have absurd fantasies
about fairy tales coming true.

00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:54.445
Some of my transgressions
are more flagrant.

00:03:54.914 --> 00:03:57.280
If a woman wants to take
her husband's name,

00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:59.992
that is her choice, and it is not
my place to judge.

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:03.598
If a woman chooses to stay home
to raise her children,

00:04:03.622 --> 00:04:05.713
I embrace that choice, too.

00:04:05.737 --> 00:04:09.808
The problem is not that she makes herself
economically vulnerable in that choice;

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:12.002
the problem is that our society is set up


00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.982
to make women economically vulnerable
when they choose.

00:04:14.982 --> 00:04:16.632
Let's deal with that.

00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:20.979
(Applause)

00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:25.484
I reject the mainstream feminism

00:04:25.508 --> 00:04:28.135
that has historically ignored
or deflected the needs

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.547
of women of color, working-class women,
queer women and transgender women,

00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:35.944
in favor of supporting white, middle-
and upper-class straight women.

00:04:35.968 --> 00:04:39.624
Listen, if that's good feminism --
I am a very bad feminist.

00:04:39.648 --> 00:04:40.738
(Laughter)

00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:42.214
There is also this:

00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:44.960
As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:48.653
We have this tendency to put
visible feminists on a pedestal.

00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:50.740
We expect them to pose perfectly.

00:04:51.287 --> 00:04:52.447
When they disappoint us,

00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:55.933
we gleefully knock them
from the very pedestal we put them on.

00:04:55.957 --> 00:04:57.992
Like I said, I am a mess --

00:04:58.016 --> 00:04:59.846
consider me knocked off that pedestal


00:04:59.846 --> 00:05:01.867
before you ever try to put me up there.

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:02.935
(Laughter)

00:05:03.374 --> 00:05:04.434
Too many women,

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:07.483
particularly groundbreaking women
and industry leaders,

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:09.845
are afraid to be labeled as feminists.

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:13.575
They're afraid to stand up and say,
"Yes, I am a feminist,"

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.844
for fear of what that label means,

00:05:15.868 --> 00:05:19.736
for fear of being unable to live up to
unrealistic expectations.

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.341
Take, for example, Beyoncé,
or as I call her, The Goddess.

00:05:24.365 --> 00:05:26.301
(Laughter)

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:29.757
She has emerged, in recent years,
as a visible feminist.

00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:32.598
At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards,

00:05:32.622 --> 00:05:36.388
she performed in front of the word
"feminist" 10 feet high.

00:05:36.412 --> 00:05:38.643
It was a glorious spectacle to see


00:05:38.643 --> 00:05:41.643
this pop star openly embracing feminism

00:05:41.643 --> 00:05:43.372
and letting young women and men know

00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:46.499
that being a feminist
is something to celebrate.

00:05:46.985 --> 00:05:50.644
As the moment faded, cultural critics
began endlessly debating

00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:53.328
whether or not Beyoncé was,
indeed, a feminist.

00:05:53.693 --> 00:05:55.574
They graded her feminism,

00:05:55.598 --> 00:05:59.866
instead of simply taking a grown,
accomplished woman at her word.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.528
(Laughter)

00:06:02.552 --> 00:06:05.226
(Applause)

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.767
We demand perfection from feminists,

00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.148
because we are still fighting for so much,

00:06:10.172 --> 00:06:11.469
we want so much,

00:06:11.493 --> 00:06:13.026
we need so damn much.

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:16.575
We go far beyond reasonable,
constructive criticism,

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.348
to dissecting any given woman's feminism,

00:06:19.372 --> 00:06:21.753
tearing it apart
until there's nothing left.

00:06:22.253 --> 00:06:23.642
We do not need to do that.

00:06:24.452 --> 00:06:28.559
Bad feminism -- or really, more inclusive
feminism -- is a starting point.

00:06:28.583 --> 00:06:30.036
But what happens next?

00:06:30.592 --> 00:06:34.074
We go from acknowledging
our imperfections to accountability,

00:06:34.098 --> 00:06:37.200
or walking the walk,
and being a little bit brave.

00:06:37.888 --> 00:06:40.192
If I listen to degrading music,

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:43.742
I am creating a demand for which
artists are more than happy

00:06:43.742 --> 00:06:45.676
to contribute a limitless supply.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.000
These artists are not going to change


00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.955
how they talk about women in their songs

00:06:49.955 --> 00:06:53.616
until we demand that change
by affecting their bottom line.

00:06:53.998 --> 00:06:56.125
Certainly, it is difficult.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.124
Why must it be so catchy?

00:06:58.561 --> 00:07:01.317
(Laughter)

00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:04.320
It's hard to make the better choice,

00:07:04.344 --> 00:07:07.140
and it is so easy to justify a lesser one.

00:07:07.164 --> 00:07:08.202
But --

00:07:08.226 --> 00:07:09.981
when I justify bad choices,

00:07:10.005 --> 00:07:12.924
I make it harder for women
to achieve equality,

00:07:12.948 --> 00:07:14.812
the equality that we all deserve,

00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:16.153
and I need to own that.

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:19.802
I think of my nieces, ages three and four.

00:07:19.826 --> 00:07:22.265
They are gorgeous
and headstrong, brilliant girls,

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:23.863
who are a whole lot of brave.

00:07:24.284 --> 00:07:27.201
I want them to thrive in a world
where they are valued

00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:29.553
for the powerful creatures they are.

00:07:29.577 --> 00:07:30.632
I think of them,

00:07:30.656 --> 00:07:34.315
and suddenly, the better choice
becomes far easier to make.

00:07:34.775 --> 00:07:36.865
We can all make better choices.

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:39.830
We can change the channel
when a television show

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.524
treats sexual violence
against women like sport,

00:07:42.548 --> 00:07:43.976
Game of Thrones.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.810
We can change the radio station

00:07:45.834 --> 00:07:49.039
when we hear songs
that treat women as nothing.

00:07:49.063 --> 00:07:51.746
We can spend our
box office dollars elsewhere

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.320
when movies don't treat women


00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.743
as anything more than decorative objects.

00:07:55.743 --> 00:07:57.984
We can stop supporting professional sports

00:07:58.008 --> 00:08:01.258
where the athletes treat 
their partners like punching bags.

00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:05.649
(Applause)

00:08:07.595 --> 00:08:10.542
In other ways, men --
and especially straight white men --

00:08:10.566 --> 00:08:13.653
can say, "No, I will not publish
with your magazine,

00:08:13.677 --> 00:08:16.963
or participate in your project,
or otherwise work with you,

00:08:16.987 --> 00:08:19.384
until you include a fair number of women,

00:08:19.408 --> 00:08:21.955
both as participants and decision makers.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.797
I won't work with you
until your publication,

00:08:24.821 --> 00:08:28.582
or your organization, is more inclusive
of all kinds of difference."

00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:31.518
Those of us who are underrepresented

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:33.711
and invited to participate
in such projects,

00:08:33.735 --> 00:08:36.104
can also decline to be included

00:08:36.128 --> 00:08:39.131
until more of us are invited
through the glass ceiling,

00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:41.107
and we are tokens no more.

00:08:41.553 --> 00:08:43.227
Without these efforts,

00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:45.053
without taking these stands,

00:08:45.077 --> 00:08:47.659
our accomplishments
are going to mean very little.

00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:50.978
We can commit these small acts of bravery

00:08:51.002 --> 00:08:54.905
and hope that our choices trickle
upward to the people in power --

00:08:54.929 --> 00:08:57.540
editors, movie and music producers,

00:08:57.564 --> 00:08:59.937
CEOs, lawmakers --

00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:02.174
the people who can make
bigger, braver choices

00:09:02.198 --> 00:09:04.979
to create lasting, meaningful change.

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.201
We can also boldly claim our feminism --

00:09:08.225 --> 00:09:10.590
good, bad, or anywhere in between.

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:13.781
The last line of my book
"Bad Feminist" says,

00:09:13.805 --> 00:09:17.724
"I would rather be a bad feminist
than no feminist at all."

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.280
This is true for so many reasons,

00:09:20.304 --> 00:09:23.864
but first and foremost, I say this
because once upon a time,

00:09:23.888 --> 00:09:25.717
my voice was stolen from me,

00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:28.666
and feminism helped me
to get my voice back.

00:09:29.455 --> 00:09:30.605
There was an incident.

00:09:30.915 --> 00:09:34.335
I call it an incident so I can carry
the burden of what happened.

00:09:34.724 --> 00:09:36.136
Some boys broke me,

00:09:36.136 --> 00:09:37.950
when I was so young, I did not know


00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.400
what boys can do to break a girl.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.542
They treated me like I was nothing.

00:09:42.566 --> 00:09:45.040
I began to believe I was nothing.

00:09:45.064 --> 00:09:47.103
They stole my voice, and in the after,

00:09:47.127 --> 00:09:48.484
I did not dare to believe

00:09:48.508 --> 00:09:50.924
that anything I might say could matter.

00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:51.957
But --

00:09:51.981 --> 00:09:53.353
I had writing.

00:09:53.377 --> 00:09:55.813
And there, I wrote myself back together.

00:09:56.242 --> 00:09:59.256
I wrote myself toward a stronger
version of myself.

00:09:59.653 --> 00:10:01.004
I read the words of women

00:10:01.028 --> 00:10:03.360
who might understand a story like mine,

00:10:03.384 --> 00:10:05.155
and women who looked like me,

00:10:05.179 --> 00:10:09.279
and understood what it was like to move
through the world with brown skin.

00:10:09.303 --> 00:10:13.578
I read the words of women
who showed me I was not nothing.

00:10:13.602 --> 00:10:15.284
I learned to write like them,

00:10:15.308 --> 00:10:17.490
and then I learned to write as myself.

00:10:17.856 --> 00:10:19.000
I found my voice again,

00:10:19.024 --> 00:10:23.080
and I started to believe that my voice
is powerful beyond measure.

00:10:24.048 --> 00:10:25.586
Through writing and feminism,

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.364
I also found that if I was
a little bit brave,

00:10:28.388 --> 00:10:31.989
another woman might hear me
and see me and recognize

00:10:32.013 --> 00:10:35.604
that none of us are the nothing
the world tries to tell us we are.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.668
In one hand,

00:10:37.692 --> 00:10:40.716
I hold the power to accomplish anything.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.741
And in my other,

00:10:41.765 --> 00:10:45.449
I hold the humbling reality
that I am just one woman.

00:10:45.918 --> 00:10:47.597
I am a bad feminist,

00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:49.263
I am a good woman,

00:10:49.287 --> 00:10:51.662
I am trying to become better
in how I think,

00:10:51.686 --> 00:10:53.946
and what I say, and what I do,

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.755
without abandoning everything
that makes me human.

00:10:57.152 --> 00:10:59.676
I hope that we can all do the same.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.943
I hope that we can all be
a little bit brave,

00:11:01.967 --> 00:11:04.054
when we most need such bravery.

00:11:04.856 --> 00:11:07.537
(Applause)
