00:00:00.825 --> 00:00:02.723
A few years ago,

00:00:02.747 --> 00:00:06.293
my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis.

00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:13.088
Her wrists, knees and toes swelled up,
causing crippling, chronic pain.

00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:16.081
She had to file for disability.

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:18.734
She stopped attending our local mosque.

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:22.913
Some mornings it was too painful
for her to brush her teeth.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:25.516
I wanted to help.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.266
But I didn't know how.

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:29.941
I'm not a doctor.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:35.011
So, what I am is a historian of medicine.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.392
So I started to research
the history of chronic pain.

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:43.978
Turns out, UCLA has an entire
history of pain collection

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.166
in their archives.

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:50.045
And I found a story --
a fantastic story --

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:55.865
of a man who saved -- rescued --
millions of people from pain;

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.277
people like my mom.

00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:00.232
Yet, I had never heard of him.

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:03.888
There were no biographies
of him, no Hollywood movies.

00:01:04.483 --> 00:01:08.272
His name was John J. Bonica.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.618
But when our story begins,

00:01:10.642 --> 00:01:14.755
he was better known as
Johnny "Bull" Walker.

00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:18.951
It was a summer day in 1941.

00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:25.017
The circus had just arrived
in the tiny town of Brookfield, New York.

00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:29.407
Spectators flocked to see
the wire-walkers, the tramp clowns --

00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:32.166
if they were lucky, the human cannonball.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.074
They also came to see the strongman,
Johnny "Bull" Walker,

00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:39.431
a brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.408
You know, on that particular day,
a voice rang out

00:01:43.432 --> 00:01:45.417
over the circus P.A. system.

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:49.278
They needed a doctor urgently,
in the live animal tent.

00:01:49.302 --> 00:01:51.686
Something had gone wrong
with the lion tamer.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.839
The climax of his act had gone wrong,

00:01:54.863 --> 00:01:59.059
and his head was stuck
inside the lion's mouth.

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:01.288
He was running out of air;

00:02:01.312 --> 00:02:03.479
the crowd watched in horror

00:02:03.503 --> 00:02:06.407
as he struggled and then passed out.

00:02:06.788 --> 00:02:10.049
When the lion finally did relax its jaws,

00:02:10.073 --> 00:02:14.527
the lion tamer just slumped
to the ground, motionless.

00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:18.182
When he came to a few minutes later,

00:02:18.206 --> 00:02:20.346
he saw a familiar figure hunched over him.

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.169
It was Bull Walker.

00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:29.049
The strongman had given the lion tamer
mouth-to-mouth, and saved his life.

00:02:30.864 --> 00:02:32.692
Now, the strongman hadn't told anyone,

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:36.175
but he was actually
a third-year medical student.

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:40.450
He toured with the circus
during summers to pay tuition,

00:02:40.474 --> 00:02:43.184
but kept it a secret
to protect his persona.

00:02:43.787 --> 00:02:47.191
He was supposed to be
a brute, a villain --

00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:49.437
not a nerdy do-gooder.

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:53.132
His medical colleagues didn't
know his secret, either.

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:57.235
As he put it, "If you were
an athlete, you were a dumb dodo."

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.320
So he didn't tell them about the circus,

00:03:00.344 --> 00:03:05.661
or about how he wrestled professionally
on evenings and weekends.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.973
He used a pseudonym like Bull Walker,

00:03:08.997 --> 00:03:10.926
or later, the Masked Marvel.

00:03:11.627 --> 00:03:15.135
He even kept it a secret that same year,

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.518
when he was crowned
the Light Heavyweight Champion

00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:19.771
of the world.

00:03:21.313 --> 00:03:25.919
Over the years, John J. Bonica
lived these parallel lives.

00:03:26.515 --> 00:03:28.209
He was a wrestler;

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:29.390
he was a doctor.

00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:31.310
He was a heel;

00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:32.491
he was a hero.

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:34.834
He inflicted pain,

00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:36.016
and he treated it.

00:03:37.242 --> 00:03:40.744
And he didnâ€™t know it at the time,
but over the next five decades,

00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:43.586
he'd draw on these dueling identities

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.923
to forge a whole new way
to think about pain.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.750
It'd change modern medicine
so much so, that decades later,

00:03:51.774 --> 00:03:56.276
Time magazine would call him
pain relief's founding father.

00:03:57.351 --> 00:03:58.844
But that all happened later.

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:05.791
In 1942, Bonica graduated
medical school and married Emma,

00:04:05.815 --> 00:04:09.491
his sweetheart, whom he had met
at one of his matches years before.

00:04:10.505 --> 00:04:13.321
He still wrestled in secret -- he had to.

00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:18.428
His internship at New York's
St. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing.

00:04:19.101 --> 00:04:22.853
With his championship belt,
he wrestled in big-ticket venues,

00:04:22.877 --> 00:04:24.814
like Madison Square Garden,

00:04:24.838 --> 00:04:26.514
against big-time opponents,

00:04:26.538 --> 00:04:29.387
like Everett "The Blonde Bear" Marshall,

00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:33.053
or three-time world champion,
Angelo Savoldi.

00:04:34.192 --> 00:04:36.969
The matches took a toll on his body;

00:04:36.993 --> 00:04:40.271
he tore hip joints, fractured ribs.

00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:45.193
One night, The Terrible Turk's big toe
scratched a scar like Capone's

00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:46.519
down the side of his face.

00:04:47.302 --> 00:04:51.341
The next morning at work,
he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.064
Twice Bonica showed up to the O.R.
with one eye so bruised,

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:58.334
he couldn't see out of it.

00:04:59.138 --> 00:05:03.641
But worst of all were
his mangled cauliflower ears.

00:05:04.094 --> 00:05:07.502
He said they felt like two baseballs
on the sides of his head.

00:05:09.153 --> 00:05:12.415
Pain just kept accumulating in his life.

00:05:13.177 --> 00:05:16.733
Next, he watched his wife go
into labor at his hospital.

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.633
She heaved and pushed, clearly in anguish.

00:05:21.657 --> 00:05:24.101
Her obstetrician called
out to the intern on duty

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:26.633
to give her a few drops of ether
to ease her pain.

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:30.880
But the intern was a young guy,
just three weeks on the job --

00:05:30.904 --> 00:05:33.840
he was jittery, and in applying the ether,

00:05:33.864 --> 00:05:35.692
irritated Emma's throat.

00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:40.093
She vomited and choked,
and started to turn blue.

00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:46.235
Bonica, who was watching all this,
pushed the intern out of the way,

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:47.840
cleared her airway,

00:05:47.864 --> 00:05:50.682
and saved his wife
and his unborn daughter.

00:05:52.172 --> 00:05:57.017
At that moment, he decided
to devote his life to anesthesiology.

00:05:57.414 --> 00:06:02.826
Later, he'd even go on to help develop
the epidural, for delivering mothers.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.985
But before he could focus on obstetrics,

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.765
Bonica had to report for basic training.

00:06:10.373 --> 00:06:11.967
Right around D-Day,

00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:15.213
Bonica showed up
to Madigan Army Medical Center,

00:06:15.237 --> 00:06:16.387
near Tacoma.

00:06:16.783 --> 00:06:21.476
At 7,700 beds, it was one of the largest
army hospitals in America.

00:06:22.242 --> 00:06:24.936
Bonica was in charge
of all pain control there.

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:27.618
He was only 27.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.764
Treating so many patients,
Bonica started noticing cases

00:06:31.788 --> 00:06:34.283
that contradicted everything
he had learned.

00:06:34.976 --> 00:06:39.822
Pain was supposed to be
a kind of alarm bell -- in a good way --

00:06:39.846 --> 00:06:43.446
a body's way of signaling an injury,
like a broken arm.

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:46.150
But in some cases,

00:06:46.174 --> 00:06:49.649
like after a patient had a leg amputated,

00:06:49.673 --> 00:06:53.694
that patient might still complain
of pain in that nonexistent leg.

00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:58.223
But if the injury had been treated, why
would the alarm bell keep ringing?

00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:02.990
There were other cases in which there
was no evidence of an injury whatsoever,

00:07:03.014 --> 00:07:05.496
and yet, still the patient hurt.

00:07:06.678 --> 00:07:10.646
Bonica tracked down all the specialists
at his hospital -- surgeons,

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.008
neurologists, psychiatrists, others.

00:07:13.782 --> 00:07:16.858
And he tried to get
their opinions on his patients.

00:07:17.643 --> 00:07:22.617
It took too long, so he started organizing
group meetings over lunch.

00:07:23.123 --> 00:07:27.589
It would be like a tag team of specialists
going up against the patient's pain.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:31.553
No one had ever focused on pain
this way before.

00:07:32.928 --> 00:07:34.928
After that, he hit the books.

00:07:35.845 --> 00:07:38.708
He read every medical textbook
he could get his hands on,

00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:41.283
carefully noting every mention
of the word "pain."

00:07:42.282 --> 00:07:46.163
Out of the 14,000 pages he read,

00:07:46.187 --> 00:07:50.363
the word "pain" was
on 17 and a half of them.

00:07:50.908 --> 00:07:52.910
Seventeen and a half.

00:07:52.934 --> 00:07:58.206
For the most basic, most common,
most frustrating part of being a patient.

00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:00.982
Bonica was shocked -- I'm quoting him,

00:08:01.006 --> 00:08:05.460
he said, "What the hell kind of conclusion
can you come to there?

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:08.666
The most important thing
from the patient's perspective,

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.055
they don't talk about."

00:08:11.295 --> 00:08:15.185
So over the next eight years,
Bonica would talk about it.

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:17.654
He'd write about it; he'd write
those missing pages.

00:08:18.057 --> 00:08:21.771
He wrote what would later be known
as the Bible of Pain.

00:08:22.575 --> 00:08:25.992
In it he proposed new strategies,

00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:29.590
new treatments using
nerve-block injections.

00:08:29.614 --> 00:08:32.357
He proposed a new institution,
the Pain Clinic,

00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:34.379
based on those lunchtime meetings.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:37.659
But the most important thing
about his book

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:41.765
was that it was kind of an emotional
alarm bell for medicine.

00:08:42.486 --> 00:08:48.467
A desperate plea to doctors
to take pain seriously

00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:49.887
in patients' lives.

00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:54.590
He recast the very purpose of medicine.

00:08:55.373 --> 00:08:59.558
The goal wasn't to make patients better;

00:08:59.582 --> 00:09:02.934
it was to make patients feel better.

00:09:04.955 --> 00:09:07.042
He pushed his pain agenda for decades,

00:09:07.066 --> 00:09:10.084
before it finally took hold
in the mid-'70s.

00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:14.285
Hundreds of pain clinics sprung up
all over the world.

00:09:15.711 --> 00:09:18.941
But as they did -- a tragic twist.

00:09:19.754 --> 00:09:22.915
Bonica's years of wrestling
caught up to him.

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:26.749
He had been out of the ring
for over 20 years,

00:09:26.773 --> 00:09:31.078
but those 1,500 professional bouts
had left a mark on his body.

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:35.838
Still in his mid-50s, he suffered
severe osteoarthritis.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.379
Over the next 20 years
he'd have 22 surgeries,

00:09:40.403 --> 00:09:42.930
including four spine operations,

00:09:42.954 --> 00:09:45.521
and hip replacement after hip replacement.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.367
He could barely raise
his arm, turn his neck.

00:09:50.144 --> 00:09:52.797
He needed aluminum crutches to walk.

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:57.899
His friends and former students
became his doctors.

00:09:57.923 --> 00:10:02.125
One recalled that he probably
had more nerve-block injections

00:10:02.149 --> 00:10:04.727
than anyone else on the planet.

00:10:06.043 --> 00:10:09.481
Already a workaholic,
he worked even more --

00:10:09.505 --> 00:10:11.451
15- to 18-hour days.

00:10:11.922 --> 00:10:14.431
Healing others became more
than just his job,

00:10:14.455 --> 00:10:17.177
it was his own most effective
form of relief.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.321
"If I wasn't as busy as I am,"
he told a reporter at the time,

00:10:22.345 --> 00:10:25.530
"I would be a completely disabled guy."

00:10:27.423 --> 00:10:30.962
On a business trip to Florida
in the early 1980s,

00:10:30.986 --> 00:10:36.318
Bonica got a former student to drive
him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa.

00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:41.482
They drove past palm trees
and pulled up to an old mansion,

00:10:41.506 --> 00:10:46.116
with giant silver howitzer cannons
hidden in the garage.

00:10:46.895 --> 00:10:49.834
The house belonged to the Zacchini family,

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:52.830
who were something like
American circus royalty.

00:10:54.229 --> 00:10:56.802
Decades earlier, Bonica had watched them,

00:10:56.826 --> 00:10:59.713
clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles,

00:10:59.737 --> 00:11:03.505
doing the act they pioneered --
the Human Cannonball.

00:11:04.772 --> 00:11:07.847
But now they were like him: retired.

00:11:09.267 --> 00:11:12.838
That generation is all dead
now, including Bonica,

00:11:12.862 --> 00:11:15.805
so there's no way to know exactly
what they said that day.

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:18.475
But still, I love imagining it.

00:11:19.233 --> 00:11:22.486
The strongman and the human
cannonballs reunited,

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.963
showing off old scars, and new ones.

00:11:25.802 --> 00:11:28.058
Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice.

00:11:28.082 --> 00:11:33.408
Maybe he told them what he later
said in an oral history,

00:11:33.432 --> 00:11:39.338
which is that his time in the circus
and wrestling deeply molded his life.

00:11:41.286 --> 00:11:43.970
Bonica saw pain close up.

00:11:45.236 --> 00:11:47.236
He felt it. He lived it.

00:11:48.453 --> 00:11:52.470
And it made it impossible
for him to ignore in others.

00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:56.563
Out of that empathy, he spun
a whole new field,

00:11:56.587 --> 00:11:59.699
played a major role in getting
medicine to acknowledge pain

00:11:59.723 --> 00:12:00.975
in and of itself.

00:12:02.627 --> 00:12:04.539
In that same oral history,

00:12:04.563 --> 00:12:07.072
Bonica claimed that pain

00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:11.353
is the most complex human experience.

00:12:12.215 --> 00:12:16.029
That it involves your past life,
your current life,

00:12:16.053 --> 00:12:18.243
your interactions, your family.

00:12:19.256 --> 00:12:21.811
That was definitely true for Bonica.

00:12:22.593 --> 00:12:25.264
But it was also true for my mom.

00:12:28.043 --> 00:12:31.342
It's easy for doctors to see my mom

00:12:31.366 --> 00:12:34.628
as a kind of professional patient,

00:12:34.652 --> 00:12:38.470
a woman who just spends her days
in waiting rooms.

00:12:39.714 --> 00:12:42.605
Sometimes I get stuck seeing her
that same way.

00:12:45.076 --> 00:12:47.043
But as I saw Bonica's pain --

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:51.599
a testament to his fully lived life --

00:12:51.623 --> 00:12:56.130
I started to remember all the things
that my mom's pain holds.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.138
Before they got swollen and arthritic,

00:13:02.162 --> 00:13:05.477
my mom's fingers clacked away

00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:08.399
in the hospital H.R. department
where she worked.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.238
They folded samosas for our entire mosque.

00:13:14.734 --> 00:13:18.435
When I was a kid, they cut my hair,

00:13:18.459 --> 00:13:20.911
wiped my nose,

00:13:20.935 --> 00:13:22.585
tied my shoes.

00:13:29.832 --> 00:13:31.157
Thank you.

00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:38.000
(Applause)
