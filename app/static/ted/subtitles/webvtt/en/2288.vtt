00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:04.379
Every group of female friends
has the funny one,

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:07.142
the one you go to
when you need a good cry,

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:10.494
the one who tells you to suck it up
when you've had a hard day.

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.793
And this group was no different.

00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:17.179
Except that this was a community
of groundbreaking women

00:00:17.203 --> 00:00:18.480
who came together --

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.979
first to become teammates,
then friends, and then family --

00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:24.524
in the least likely of places:

00:00:24.548 --> 00:00:26.901
on the Special Operations battlefield.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:31.002
This was a group of women
whose friendship and valor was cemented

00:00:31.026 --> 00:00:35.484
not only by what they had seen
and done at the tip of the spear,

00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:37.479
but by the fact that they were there

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:40.021
at a time when women --
officially, at least --

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:42.580
remained banned from ground combat,

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:46.309
and America had no idea they existed.

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:50.408
This story begins
with Special Operations leaders,

00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:54.009
some of the most tested men
in the United States military, saying,

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:57.368
"We need women to help us wage this war."

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:01.747
"America would never kill its way
to the end of its wars," it argued.

00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:04.431
"Needed more knowledge
and more understanding."

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.219
And as everyone knows,

00:01:06.243 --> 00:01:09.790
if you want to understand what's happening
in a community and in a home,

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:11.387
you talk to women,

00:01:11.411 --> 00:01:14.101
whether you're talking about
Southern Afghanistan,

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:15.840
or Southern California.

00:01:16.558 --> 00:01:19.130
But in this case,
men could not talk to women,

00:01:19.154 --> 00:01:22.553
because in a conservative
and traditional society like Afghanistan,

00:01:22.577 --> 00:01:24.785
that would cause grave offense.

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:26.991
So you needed women soldiers out there.

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:33.018
That meant, at this time in the war,
that the women who would be recruited

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:35.905
to serve alongside Army Rangers
and Navy SEALs,

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.389
would be seeing the kind of combat
experienced by less than five percent

00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:42.757
of the entire United States military.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.259
Less than five percent.

00:01:46.587 --> 00:01:48.121
So the call went out.

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:50.556
"Female soldiers:
Become a part of history.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.703
Join Special Operations
on the battlefield in Afghanistan."

00:01:54.727 --> 00:01:56.501
This is in 2011.

00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:58.714
And from Alabama to Alaska,

00:01:58.738 --> 00:02:02.671
a group of women who had always
wanted to do something that mattered

00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:04.673
alongside the best of the best,

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:06.950
and to make a difference
for their country,

00:02:06.974 --> 00:02:08.959
answered that call to serve.

00:02:10.294 --> 00:02:15.926
And for them it was not about politics,
it was about serving with purpose.

00:02:16.858 --> 00:02:19.316
And so, the women who came
to North Carolina

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.043
to compete for a spot on these teams

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:25.264
which would put women
on the Special Operations front lines,

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:28.659
landed and found
very quickly a community,

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.280
the likes of which they had never seen.

00:02:31.304 --> 00:02:34.872
Full of women who were as fierce
and as fit as they were,

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:36.678
and as driven to make a difference.

00:02:37.128 --> 00:02:39.567
They didn't have to apologize
for who they were,

00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:41.591
and in fact, they could celebrate it.

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:46.706
And what they found when they were there
was that all of a sudden,

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:48.743
there were lots of people like them.

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:50.866
As one of them said,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.936
"It was like you looked
around and realized

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.200
there was more
than one giraffe at the zoo."

00:02:57.212 --> 00:02:59.929
Among this team of standouts was Cassie,

00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:04.423
a young woman who managed to be
an ROTC cadet, a sorority sister

00:03:04.447 --> 00:03:07.075
and a Women's Studies minor,
all in one person.

00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:12.971
Tristan, a West Point track star,
who always ran and road marched

00:03:12.995 --> 00:03:14.232
with no socks,

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.406
and had shoes whose smell proved it.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.873
(Laughter)

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:21.871
Amber, a Heidi look-alike, who had
always wanted to be in the infantry,

00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:24.371
and when she found out
that women couldn't be,

00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:27.041
she decided to become an intel officer.

00:03:27.626 --> 00:03:28.856
She served in Bosnia,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.445
and later helped the FBI
to bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.458
And then there was Kate,
who played high school football

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.694
all four years,

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:40.300
and actually wanted to drop out
after the first,

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:41.801
to go into the glee club,

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:44.708
but when boys told her
that girls couldn't play football,

00:03:44.732 --> 00:03:45.989
she decided to stay

00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:48.803
for all the little girls
who would come after her.

00:03:50.268 --> 00:03:52.949
For them, biology had shaped
part of their destiny,

00:03:52.973 --> 00:03:55.055
and put, as Cassie once said,

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.571
"everything noble
out of reach for girls."

00:03:58.353 --> 00:04:01.649
And yet, here was a chance
to serve with the best of the best

00:04:01.673 --> 00:04:03.733
on a mission that mattered
to their country,

00:04:03.757 --> 00:04:06.432
not despite the fact
that they were female,

00:04:06.456 --> 00:04:07.839
but because of it.

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.736
This team of women, in many ways,
was like women everywhere.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.331
They wore makeup, and in fact,

00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:17.800
they would bond in the ladies' room
over eyeliner and eye pencil.

00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:20.166
They also wore body armor.

00:04:20.543 --> 00:04:22.931
They would put 50 pounds
of weight on their backs,

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:24.981
and board the helicopter for an operation,

00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:28.037
and they would come back and watch
a movie called "Bridesmaids."

00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:29.912
(Laughter)

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.645
They even wore a thing called Spanx,

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.609
because, as they found very quickly,

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:38.525
the uniforms made for men were
big where they should be small,

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:40.599
and small where they should be big.

00:04:40.623 --> 00:04:44.160
So Lane, an Iraq War veteran --
you see her here on my left --

00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:46.240
decided she was going to go on Amazon

00:04:46.264 --> 00:04:48.383
and order a pair of Spanx to her base,

00:04:48.407 --> 00:04:52.159
so that her pants would fit better
when she went out on mission each night.

00:04:52.822 --> 00:04:55.247
These women would get together
over video conference

00:04:55.247 --> 00:04:57.728
from all around Afghanistan
from their various bases,

00:04:57.728 --> 00:04:59.736
and they would talk about what it was like

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.411
to be one of the only women
doing what they were doing.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:03.612
They would swap jokes,

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:06.088
they would talk about
what was working, what wasn't,

00:05:06.112 --> 00:05:09.159
what they had learned to do well,
what they needed to do better.

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:12.606
And they would talk about
some of the lighter moments of being women

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.122
out on the Special Operations front lines,

00:05:15.146 --> 00:05:16.511
including the Shewee,

00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:18.850
which was a tool
that let you pee like a guy,

00:05:18.874 --> 00:05:23.302
although it's said to have had only
a 40 percent accuracy rate out there.

00:05:23.326 --> 00:05:26.417
(Laughter)

00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:28.441
These women lived in the "and."

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.301
They proved you could be fierce
and you could be feminine.

00:05:32.325 --> 00:05:35.197
You could wear mascara and body armor.

00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:39.277
You could love CrossFit,
and really like cross-stitch.

00:05:39.301 --> 00:05:44.059
You could love to climb out of helicopters
and you could also love to bake cookies.

00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:48.007
Women live in the and every single day,

00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:51.080
and these women brought that
to this mission as well.

00:05:52.547 --> 00:05:55.156
On this life and death battlefield
they never forgot

00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:58.557
that being female may have brought them
to the front lines,

00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:01.358
but being a soldier is what would
prove themselves there.

00:06:02.272 --> 00:06:04.436
There was the night Amber went
out on mission,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.430
and in talking to the women of the house,

00:06:06.454 --> 00:06:09.279
realized that there was
a barricaded shooter lying in wait

00:06:09.303 --> 00:06:12.835
for the Afghan and American forces
who were waiting to enter the home.

00:06:13.418 --> 00:06:16.213
Another night it was Tristan
who found out

00:06:16.237 --> 00:06:18.401
that there were pieces
that make up explosives

00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:20.722
all around the house
in which they were standing,

00:06:20.746 --> 00:06:23.525
and that in fact, explosives lay
all the way between there

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:26.037
and where they were
about to head that night.

00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:29.132
There was the night another one
of their teammates proved herself

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:31.623
to a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs,

00:06:31.647 --> 00:06:34.043
when she found the intel item
they were looking for

00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:36.329
wrapped up in a baby's wet diaper.

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:40.546
And there was the night that Isabel,
another one of their teammates,

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.668
found the things
that they were looking for,

00:06:42.692 --> 00:06:44.808
and received an Impact Award
from the Rangers

00:06:44.832 --> 00:06:46.558
who said that without her,

00:06:46.582 --> 00:06:49.336
the things and the people
they were looking for that night

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.784
would never have been found.

00:06:51.553 --> 00:06:53.381
That night and so many others,

00:06:53.405 --> 00:06:56.518
they went out to prove themselves,
not only for one another,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.812
but for everybody
who would come after them.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:02.306
And also for the men
alongside whom they served.

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:07.948
We talk a lot about how
behind every great man is a good woman.

00:07:08.354 --> 00:07:09.511
And in this case,

00:07:09.535 --> 00:07:12.773
next to these women stood men
who wanted to see them succeed.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:16.814
The Army Ranger who trained them
had served 12 deployments.

00:07:17.406 --> 00:07:20.400
And when they told him
that he had to go train girls,

00:07:20.424 --> 00:07:22.776
he had no idea what to expect.

00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:27.691
But at the end of eight days with these
women in the summer of 2011,

00:07:27.715 --> 00:07:32.136
he told his fellow Ranger,
"We have just witnessed history.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.784
These may well be
our own Tuskegee Airmen."

00:07:37.666 --> 00:07:44.002
(Applause)

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.016
At the heart of this team
was the one person

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.188
who everyone called "the best of us."

00:07:49.675 --> 00:07:52.140
She was a petite blonde dynamo,

00:07:52.164 --> 00:07:54.228
who barely reached five-foot-three.

00:07:54.772 --> 00:07:57.903
And she was this wild mix
of Martha Stewart,

00:07:57.927 --> 00:07:59.927
and what we know as G.I. Jane.

00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:03.489
She was someone who loved
to make dinner for her husband,

00:08:03.513 --> 00:08:07.616
her Kent State ROTC sweetheart
who pushed her to be her best,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.969
and to trust herself,

00:08:08.993 --> 00:08:11.223
and to test every limit she could.

00:08:11.944 --> 00:08:16.114
She also loved to put 50 pounds of weight
on her back and run for miles,

00:08:16.138 --> 00:08:18.059
and she loved to be a soldier.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.314
She was somebody who had a bread maker
in her office in Kandahar,

00:08:22.338 --> 00:08:25.270
and would bake a batch of raisin bread,
and then go to the gym

00:08:25.294 --> 00:08:28.085
and bust out 25 or 30 pull-ups
from a dead hang.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.993
She was the person who, if you needed
an extra pair of boots

00:08:32.017 --> 00:08:34.972
or a home-cooked dinner,
would be on your speed dial.

00:08:35.404 --> 00:08:37.642
Because she never, ever would talk to you

00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:38.817
about how good she was,

00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:41.049
but let her character speak
through action.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:48.086
She was famous for taking the hard right
over the easy wrong.

00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:51.877
And she was also famous
for walking up to a 15-foot rope,

00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:54.061
climbing it using only her arms,

00:08:54.085 --> 00:08:56.086
and then shuffling away and apologizing,

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.500
because she knew she was supposed
to use both her arms and her legs,

00:08:59.524 --> 00:09:01.221
as the Rangers had trained them.

00:09:01.245 --> 00:09:03.121
(Laughter)

00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:06.448
Some of our heroes return home
to tell their stories.

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:08.958
And some of them don't.

00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.503
And on October 22, 2011,

00:09:12.527 --> 00:09:16.095
First Lieutenant Ashley White was killed
alongside two Rangers,

00:09:16.119 --> 00:09:17.474
Christopher Horns

00:09:17.498 --> 00:09:18.854
and Kristoffer Domeij.

00:09:19.998 --> 00:09:23.247
Her death threw this program built
for the shadows

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:25.298
into a very public spotlight.

00:09:25.322 --> 00:09:26.475
Because after all,

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:29.666
the ban on women in combat
was still very much in place.

00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:32.270
And at her funeral,

00:09:32.294 --> 00:09:36.722
the head of Army Special Operations came,
and gave a public testimony

00:09:36.722 --> 00:09:38.937
not just to the courage of Ashley White,

00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:40.961
but to all her team of sisters.

00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:46.174
"Make no mistake about it," he said,
"these women are warriors,

00:09:46.198 --> 00:09:49.514
and they have written a new chapter
in what it means to be a female

00:09:49.538 --> 00:09:51.456
in the United States Army."

00:09:52.989 --> 00:09:56.667
Ashley's mom is a teacher's aide
and a school bus driver,

00:09:56.691 --> 00:09:58.595
who bakes cookies on the side.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.522
She doesn't remember much
about that overwhelming set of days,

00:10:02.546 --> 00:10:05.315
in which grief -- enormous grief --

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:06.622
mixed with pride.

00:10:07.359 --> 00:10:09.359
But she does remember one moment.

00:10:09.913 --> 00:10:13.319
A stranger with a child
in her hand came up to her

00:10:13.343 --> 00:10:16.025
and she said, "Mrs. White,

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:18.347
I brought my daughter here today,

00:10:18.371 --> 00:10:21.060
because I wanted her to know
what a hero was.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.514
And I wanted her to know
that heroes could be women, too."

00:10:27.749 --> 00:10:31.363
It is time to celebrate
all the unsung heroines

00:10:31.387 --> 00:10:33.136
who reach into their guts

00:10:33.136 --> 00:10:37.377
and find the heart and the grit
to keep going and to test every limit.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.820
This very unlikely band of sisters
bound forever in life and afterward

00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:46.166
did indeed become part of history,

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.321
and they paved the way for so many
who would come after them,

00:10:49.345 --> 00:10:53.575
as much as they stood on the shoulders
of those who had come before.

00:10:54.303 --> 00:10:58.448
These women showed that warriors come
in all shapes and sizes.

00:10:59.454 --> 00:11:01.754
And women can be heroes, too.

00:11:02.648 --> 00:11:03.800
Thank you so much.

00:11:03.824 --> 00:11:09.950
(Applause)
