00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:02.918
This is my great uncle,

00:00:02.918 --> 00:00:05.936
my father's father's younger brother.

00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:07.902
His name was Joe McKenna.

00:00:08.142 --> 00:00:13.089
He was a young husband
and a semi-pro basketball player

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.417
and a fireman in New York City.

00:00:17.407 --> 00:00:20.007
Family history says
he loved being a fireman,

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.542
and so in 1938, on one of his days off,

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:26.319
he elected to hang out at the firehouse.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.218
To make himself useful that day,
he started polishing all the brass,

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:34.612
the railings on the fire truck,
the fittings on the walls,

00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:36.957
and one of the fire hose nozzles,

00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:39.465
a giant, heavy piece of metal,

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:43.074
toppled off a shelf and hit him.

00:00:43.574 --> 00:00:47.382
A few days later,
his shoulder started to hurt.

00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:50.656
Two days after that, he spiked a fever.

00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:53.141
The fever climbed and climbed.

00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:55.091
His wife was taking care of him,

00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:59.393
but nothing she did made a difference,
and when they got the local doctor in,

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.679
nothing he did mattered either.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.460
They flagged down a cab
and took him to the hospital.

00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:09.905
The nurses there recognized right away
that he had an infection,

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:14.061
what at the time they would
have called "blood poisoning,"

00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.174
and though they probably didn't say it,

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:18.031
they would have known right away

00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:21.430
that there was nothing they could do.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.788
There was nothing they could do
because the things we use now

00:01:24.788 --> 00:01:27.437
to cure infections didn't exist yet.

00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:31.173
The first test of penicillin,
the first antibiotic,

00:01:31.173 --> 00:01:33.843
was three years in the future.

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:38.547
People who got infections
either recovered, if they were lucky,

00:01:38.547 --> 00:01:40.042
or they died.

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:42.411
My great uncle was not lucky.

00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:45.708
He was in the hospital for a week,
shaking with chills,

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:47.566
dehydrated and delirious,

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:50.468
sinking into a coma as his organs failed.

00:01:50.468 --> 00:01:52.604
His condition grew so desperate

00:01:52.604 --> 00:01:57.234
that the people from his firehouse
lined up to give him transfusions

00:01:57.234 --> 00:02:01.097
hoping to dilute the infection
surging through his blood.

00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:04.603
Nothing worked. He died.

00:02:05.143 --> 00:02:07.705
He was 30 years old.

00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:10.088
If you look back through history,

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:13.362
most people died the way
my great uncle died.

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:16.032
Most people didn't die
of cancer or heart disease,

00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:20.120
the lifestyle diseases that afflict us
in the West today.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.229
They didn't die of those diseases
because they didn't live long enough

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.225
to develop them.

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:28.338
They died of injuries --

00:02:28.338 --> 00:02:30.823
being gored by an ox,

00:02:30.823 --> 00:02:32.727
shot on a battlefield,

00:02:32.727 --> 00:02:36.465
crushed in one of the new factories
of the Industrial Revolution --

00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:39.846
and most of the time from infection,

00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:43.352
which finished what those injuries began.

00:02:44.492 --> 00:02:48.024
All of that changed
when antibiotics arrived.

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.198
Suddenly, infections that had
been a death sentence

00:02:52.198 --> 00:02:55.588
became something
you recovered from in days.

00:02:55.588 --> 00:02:58.630
It seemed like a miracle,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.954
and ever since, we have been living inside
the golden epoch of the miracle drugs.

00:03:05.294 --> 00:03:09.241
And now, we are coming to an end of it.

00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:14.303
My great uncle died in the last days
of the pre-antibiotic era.

00:03:14.303 --> 00:03:19.457
We stand today on the threshold
of the post-antibiotic era,

00:03:19.457 --> 00:03:23.219
in the earliest days of a time
when simple infections

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:27.928
such as the one Joe had
will kill people once again.

00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:32.015
In fact, they already are.

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:35.618
People are dying of infections again
because of a phenomenon

00:03:35.618 --> 00:03:37.961
called antibiotic resistance.

00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:40.119
Briefly, it works like this.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:45.091
Bacteria compete against each other
for resources, for food,

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:49.758
by manufacturing lethal compounds
that they direct against each other.

00:03:49.758 --> 00:03:52.103
Other bacteria, to protect themselves,

00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:55.354
evolve defenses against
that chemical attack.

00:03:55.354 --> 00:03:57.676
When we first made antibiotics,

00:03:57.676 --> 00:04:01.878
we took those compounds into the lab
and made our own versions of them,

00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:06.336
and bacteria responded to our attack
the way they always had.

00:04:07.674 --> 00:04:09.898
Here is what happened next:

00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:13.488
Penicillin was distributed in 1943,

00:04:13.488 --> 00:04:18.619
and widespread penicillin resistance
arrived by 1945.

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:21.568
Vancomycin arrived in 1972,

00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:24.668
vancomycin resistance in 1988.

00:04:25.028 --> 00:04:27.150
Imipenem in 1985,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.922
and resistance to in 1998.

00:04:30.192 --> 00:04:33.860
Daptomycin, one of
the most recent drugs, in 2003,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.225
and resistance to it
just a year later in 2004.

00:04:38.575 --> 00:04:42.335
For 70 years, we played
a game of leapfrog --

00:04:42.335 --> 00:04:45.261
our drug and their resistance,

00:04:45.261 --> 00:04:48.906
and then another drug,
and then resistance again --

00:04:48.906 --> 00:04:51.217
and now the game is ending.

00:04:51.437 --> 00:04:55.477
Bacteria develop resistance so quickly
that pharmaceutical companies

00:04:55.477 --> 00:04:59.842
have decided making antibiotics
is not in their best interest,

00:04:59.842 --> 00:05:02.652
so there are infections
moving across the world

00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:06.111
for which, out of the more
than 100 antibiotics

00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:08.340
available on the market,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.754
two drugs might work with side effects,

00:05:11.754 --> 00:05:14.238
or one drug,

00:05:14.238 --> 00:05:15.646
or none.

00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:17.668
This is what that looks like.

00:05:18.278 --> 00:05:22.458
In 2000, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the CDC,

00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:24.501
identified a single case

00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:26.753
in a hospital in North Carolina

00:05:26.753 --> 00:05:30.486
of an infection resistant
to all but two drugs.

00:05:30.886 --> 00:05:35.205
Today, that infection, known as KPC,

00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:37.805
has spread to every state but three,

00:05:37.805 --> 00:05:40.150
and to South America, Europe

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.357
and the Middle East.

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:45.189
In 2008, doctors in Sweden

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:47.975
diagnosed a man from India
with a different infection

00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:51.690
resistant to all but one drug that time.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.919
The gene that creates that resistance,

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:00.444
known as NDM, has now spread
from India into China, Asia, Africa,

00:06:00.444 --> 00:06:04.809
Europe and Canada, and the United States.

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.688
It would be natural to hope

00:06:07.688 --> 00:06:11.287
that these infections
are extraordinary cases,

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:13.145
but in fact,

00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:15.606
in the United States and Europe,

00:06:15.606 --> 00:06:18.322
50,000 people a year

00:06:18.322 --> 00:06:22.446
die of infections which no drugs can help.

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:26.008
A project chartered
by the British government

00:06:26.008 --> 00:06:29.746
known as the Review
on Antimicrobial Resistance

00:06:29.746 --> 00:06:37.118
estimates that the worldwide toll
right now is 700,000 deaths a year.

00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:42.655
That is a lot of deaths,

00:06:42.655 --> 00:06:45.767
and yet, the chances are good
that you don't feel at risk,

00:06:45.767 --> 00:06:48.995
that you imagine these people
were hospital patients

00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:50.713
in intensive care units

00:06:50.713 --> 00:06:54.660
or nursing home residents
near the ends of their lives,

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.841
people whose infections
are remote from us,

00:06:57.841 --> 00:07:01.045
in situations we can't identify with.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:05.852
What you didn't think about,
none of us do,

00:07:05.852 --> 00:07:10.818
is that antibiotics support
almost all of modern life.

00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:13.932
If we lost antibiotics,

00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:15.386
here's what else we'd lose:

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:20.015
First, any protection for people
with weakened immune systems --

00:07:20.015 --> 00:07:23.475
cancer patients, AIDS patients,

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:27.979
transplant recipients, premature babies.

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:32.391
Next, any treatment that installs
foreign objects in the body:

00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:36.269
stents for stroke, pumps for diabetes,

00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:40.193
dialysis, joint replacements.

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:43.908
How many athletic baby boomers
need new hips and knees?

00:07:43.908 --> 00:07:46.717
A recent study estimates
that without antibiotics,

00:07:46.717 --> 00:07:50.234
one out of ever six would die.

00:07:50.664 --> 00:07:53.869
Next, we'd probably lose surgery.

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:56.191
Many operations are preceded

00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:59.139
by prophylactic doses of antibiotics.

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:00.811
Without that protection,

00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:05.015
we'd lose the ability to open
the hidden spaces of the body.

00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:07.848
So no heart operations,

00:08:07.848 --> 00:08:10.680
no prostate biopsies,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.382
no Cesarean sections.

00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:18.444
We'd have to learn to fear infections
that now seem minor.

00:08:18.784 --> 00:08:22.592
Strep throat used to cause heart failure.

00:08:22.592 --> 00:08:25.239
Skin infections led to amputations.

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:28.722
Giving birth killed,
in the cleanest hospitals,

00:08:28.722 --> 00:08:31.397
almost one woman out of every 100.

00:08:31.717 --> 00:08:36.550
Pneumonia took three children
out of every 10.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.333
More than anything else,

00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:43.708
we'd lose the confident way
we live our everyday lives.

00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:49.043
If you knew that any injury
could kill you,

00:08:49.043 --> 00:08:52.289
would you ride a motorcycle,

00:08:52.289 --> 00:08:55.500
bomb down a ski slope,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.976
climb a ladder to hang
your Christmas lights,

00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:02.643
let your kid slide into home plate?

00:09:03.573 --> 00:09:06.638
After all, the first person
to receive penicillin,

00:09:06.638 --> 00:09:10.516
a British policeman named
Albert Alexander,

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:14.858
who was so ravaged by infection
that his scalp oozed pus

00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:17.783
and doctors had to take out an eye,

00:09:17.783 --> 00:09:21.162
was infected by doing
something very simple.

00:09:22.172 --> 00:09:26.988
He walked into his garden
and scratched his face on a thorn.

00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:32.481
That British project I mentioned
which estimates that the worldwide toll

00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:36.358
right now is 700,000 deaths a year

00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:42.535
also predicts that if we can't
get this under control by 2050,

00:09:42.535 --> 00:09:50.127
not long, the worldwide toll
will be 10 million deaths a year.

00:09:50.127 --> 00:09:52.829
How did we get to this point

00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:54.864
where what we have to look forward to

00:09:54.864 --> 00:09:58.347
is those terrifying numbers?

00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:02.535
The difficult answer is,
we did it to ourselves.

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:05.847
Resistance is an inevitable
biological process,

00:10:05.847 --> 00:10:09.900
but we bear the responsibility
for accelerating it.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.043
We did this by squandering antibiotics

00:10:14.043 --> 00:10:18.131
with a heedlessness
that now seems shocking.

00:10:19.408 --> 00:10:23.494
Penicillin was sold
over the counter until the 1950s.

00:10:23.494 --> 00:10:26.829
In much of the developing world,
most antibiotics still are.

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:30.971
In the United States, 50 percent

00:10:30.971 --> 00:10:34.663
of the antibiotics given
in hospitals are unnecessary.

00:10:34.663 --> 00:10:39.037
Forty-five percent of the prescriptions
written in doctor's offices

00:10:39.037 --> 00:10:43.010
are for conditions
that antibiotics cannot help.

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:47.247
And that's just in healthcare.

00:10:47.247 --> 00:10:52.100
On much of the planet, most meat animals
get antibiotics every day of their lives,

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.376
not to cure illnesses,

00:10:54.376 --> 00:10:57.835
but to fatten them up
and to protect them against

00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:01.806
the factory farm conditions
they are raised in.

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:04.824
In the United States, possibly 80 percent

00:11:04.824 --> 00:11:11.527
of the antibiotics sold every year
go to farm animals, not to humans,

00:11:11.527 --> 00:11:15.203
creating resistant bacteria
that move off the farm

00:11:15.203 --> 00:11:17.827
in water, in dust,

00:11:17.827 --> 00:11:20.695
in the meat the animals become.

00:11:20.985 --> 00:11:23.910
Aquaculture depends on antibiotics too,

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.559
particularly in Asia,

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:28.902
and fruit growing relies on antibiotics

00:11:28.902 --> 00:11:33.801
to protect apples, pears,
citrus, against disease.

00:11:34.491 --> 00:11:40.117
And because bacteria can pass
their DNA to each other

00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:44.552
like a traveler handing off
a suitcase at an airport,

00:11:44.552 --> 00:11:49.360
once we have encouraged
that resistance into existence,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.587
there is no knowing where it will spread.

00:11:53.723 --> 00:11:55.294
This was predictable.

00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:58.506
In fact, it was predicted

00:11:58.506 --> 00:12:02.941
by Alexander Fleming,
the man who discovered penicillin.

00:12:02.941 --> 00:12:06.935
He was given the Nobel Prize
in 1945 in recognition,

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:11.282
and in an interview shortly after,
this is what he said:

00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:15.549
"The thoughtless person playing
with penicillin treatment

00:12:15.549 --> 00:12:18.823
is morally responsible
for the death of a man

00:12:18.823 --> 00:12:21.147
who succumbs to infection

00:12:21.147 --> 00:12:24.050
with a pencillin-resistant organism."

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.335
He added, "I hope this evil
can be averted."

00:12:28.986 --> 00:12:31.842
Can we avert it?

00:12:31.842 --> 00:12:35.510
There are companies working
on novel antibiotics,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.086
things the superbugs
have never seen before.

00:12:39.086 --> 00:12:41.803
We need those new drugs badly,

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.055
and we need incentives:

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.586
discovery grants, extended patents,

00:12:46.586 --> 00:12:53.343
prizes, to lure other companies
into making antibiotics again.

00:12:53.343 --> 00:12:55.709
But that probably won't be enough.

00:12:56.059 --> 00:13:00.163
Here's why: Evolution always wins.

00:13:00.703 --> 00:13:04.627
Bacteria birth a new generation
every 20 minutes.

00:13:04.627 --> 00:13:09.410
It takes pharmaceutical chemistry
10 years to derive a new drug.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.266
Every time we use an antibiotic,

00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:15.540
we give the bacteria billions of chances

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.281
to crack the codes

00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:20.486
of the defenses we've constructed.

00:13:20.486 --> 00:13:22.877
There has never yet been a drug

00:13:22.877 --> 00:13:25.431
they could not defeat.

00:13:25.431 --> 00:13:28.961
This is asymmetric warfare,

00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:32.969
but we can change the outcome.

00:13:33.929 --> 00:13:40.334
We could build systems to harvest data
to tell us automatically and specifically

00:13:40.334 --> 00:13:43.263
how antibiotics are being used.

00:13:43.263 --> 00:13:46.096
We could build gatekeeping
into drug order systems

00:13:46.096 --> 00:13:49.811
so that every prescription
gets a second look.

00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:55.920
We could require agriculture
to give up antibiotic use.

00:13:56.243 --> 00:13:59.275
We could build surveillance systems

00:13:59.275 --> 00:14:03.501
to tell us where resistance
is emerging next.

00:14:03.501 --> 00:14:05.814
Those are the tech solutions.

00:14:06.264 --> 00:14:08.888
They probably aren't enough either,

00:14:08.888 --> 00:14:12.117
unless we help.

00:14:15.785 --> 00:14:18.099
Antibiotic resistance is a habit.

00:14:18.479 --> 00:14:21.567
We all know how hard it is
to change a habit.

00:14:21.567 --> 00:14:26.097
But as a society,
we've done that in the past.

00:14:26.397 --> 00:14:29.972
People used to toss litter
into the streets,

00:14:29.972 --> 00:14:31.737
used to not wear seatbelts,

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:35.994
used to smoke inside public buildings.

00:14:36.404 --> 00:14:38.624
We don't do those things anymore.

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:41.466
We don't trash the environment

00:14:41.466 --> 00:14:44.623
or court devastating accidents

00:14:44.623 --> 00:14:47.595
or expose others
to the possibility of cancer,

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:51.102
because we decided those things
were expensive,

00:14:51.102 --> 00:14:55.175
destructive, not in our best interest.

00:14:55.815 --> 00:14:58.715
We changed social norms.

00:14:59.135 --> 00:15:03.279
We could change social norms
around antibiotic use too.

00:15:05.499 --> 00:15:07.774
I know that the scale
of antibiotic resistance

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:09.678
seems overwhelming,

00:15:09.678 --> 00:15:13.138
but if you've ever bought
a fluorescent lightbulb

00:15:13.138 --> 00:15:15.854
because you were concerned
about climate change,

00:15:15.854 --> 00:15:18.989
or read the label on a box of crackers

00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:23.470
because you think about
the deforestation from palm oil,

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.349
you already know what it feels like

00:15:26.349 --> 00:15:31.349
to take a tiny step to address
an overwhelming problem.

00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:36.310
We could take those kinds of steps
for antibiotic use too.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:43.947
We could forgo giving an antibiotic
if we're not sure it's the right one.

00:15:44.251 --> 00:15:50.564
We could stop insisting on a prescription
for our kid's ear infection

00:15:50.564 --> 00:15:52.462
before we're sure what caused it.

00:15:53.678 --> 00:15:57.045
We could ask every restaurant,

00:15:57.045 --> 00:15:58.856
every supermarket,

00:15:58.856 --> 00:16:00.476
where their meat comes from.

00:16:00.806 --> 00:16:02.640
We could promise each other

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.745
never again to buy chicken
or shrimp or fruit

00:16:06.745 --> 00:16:09.629
raised with routine antibiotic use,

00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:12.323
and if we did those things,

00:16:12.323 --> 00:16:16.815
we could slow down the arrival
of the post-antibiotic world.

00:16:17.547 --> 00:16:21.680
But we have to do it soon.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.185
Penicillin began
the antibiotic era in 1943.

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:31.891
In just 70 years, we walked ourselves
up to the edge of disaster.

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:34.613
We won't get 70 years

00:16:34.613 --> 00:16:38.339
to find our way back out again.

00:16:38.769 --> 00:16:40.279
Thank you very much.

00:16:40.789 --> 00:16:46.640
(Applause)
