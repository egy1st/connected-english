00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.044
I grew up to study the brain

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:04.482
because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed

00:00:04.506 --> 00:00:07.452
with a brain disorder, schizophrenia.

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:11.417
And as a sister and later, as a scientist,

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:15.734
I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams,

00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:17.993
I can connect them to my reality,

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.683
and I can make my dreams come true?

00:00:20.707 --> 00:00:24.484
What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia

00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:29.976
that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so they instead become delusion?

00:00:32.373 --> 00:00:37.349
So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses.

00:00:37.373 --> 00:00:40.976
And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.527
where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes,

00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:46.818
in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry.

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:49.976
And in the lab,
we were asking the question,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.850
"What are the biological differences

00:00:52.874 --> 00:00:56.976
between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.670
as compared with the brains of individuals

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:04.610
diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"

00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:09.125
So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain:

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.251
which cells are communicating
with which cells,

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:13.809
with which chemicals,

00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:17.182
and then in what quantities
of those chemicals?

00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:19.435
So there was a lot of meaning in my life

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.967
because I was performing
this type of research during the day,

00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:26.093
but then in the evenings
and on the weekends,

00:01:26.117 --> 00:01:31.680
I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

00:01:31.704 --> 00:01:34.976
But on the morning of December 10, 1996,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.976
I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own.

00:01:39.357 --> 00:01:43.900
A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain.

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:46.094
And in the course of four hours,

00:01:46.118 --> 00:01:49.320
I watched my brain completely deteriorate

00:01:49.344 --> 00:01:52.928
in its ability to process all information.

00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:54.707
On the morning of the hemorrhage,

00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:59.976
I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.976
If you've ever seen a human brain,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.845
it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another.

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.389
And I have brought for you
a real human brain.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.945
(Groaning, laughter)

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:27.445
So this is a real human brain.

00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:29.976
This is the front of the brain,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.445
the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down,

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.896
and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head.

00:02:37.912 --> 00:02:39.456
And when you look at the brain,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.489
it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices

00:02:42.513 --> 00:02:45.203
are completely separate from one another.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.976
For those of you who understand computers,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.925
our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor,

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.679
while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor.

00:02:56.222 --> 00:02:59.047
The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another

00:02:59.071 --> 00:03:00.626
through the corpus callosum,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.844
which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers.

00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:05.976
But other than that,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.260
the two hemispheres
are completely separate.

00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:12.976
Because they process
information differently,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.976
each of our hemispheres
think about different things,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.564
they care about different things,
and, dare I say,

00:03:19.588 --> 00:03:22.003
they have very different personalities.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.762
Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.

00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:30.086
Assistant: It has been.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.666
(Laughter)

00:03:33.202 --> 00:03:38.031
Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment.

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:41.976
It's all about "right here, right now."

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.976
Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.976
and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.976
Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.976
through all of our sensory systems

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.976
and then it explodes
into this enormous collage

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.976
of what this present moment looks like,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.976
what this present moment
smells like and tastes like,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.976
what it feels like
and what it sounds like.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.976
I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.523
through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere.

00:04:20.238 --> 00:04:23.856
We are energy-beings
connected to one another

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.651
through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres

00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:29.000
as one human family.

00:04:29.487 --> 00:04:33.524
And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet,

00:04:33.548 --> 00:04:36.976
here to make the world a better place.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.976
My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.138
Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically.

00:04:53.853 --> 00:04:58.976
Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.976
Our left hemisphere is designed to take

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.592
that enormous collage
of the present moment

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:09.666
and start picking out details,
and more details about those details.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.083
It then categorizes and organizes
all that information,

00:05:14.107 --> 00:05:17.618
associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned,

00:05:17.642 --> 00:05:21.400
and projects into the future
all of our possibilities.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.976
And our left hemisphere
thinks in language.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.928
It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world

00:05:30.952 --> 00:05:32.976
to my external world.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.766
It's that little voice that says to me,

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.578
"Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home.

00:05:39.602 --> 00:05:40.976
I need them in the morning."

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.898
It's that calculating intelligence

00:05:42.922 --> 00:05:46.741
that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry.

00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:51.594
But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me,

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:55.449
"I am. I am."

00:05:55.473 --> 00:05:59.468
And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am,"

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:01.106
I become separate.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.385
I become a single solid individual,

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.704
separate from the energy flow around me

00:06:05.728 --> 00:06:07.560
and separate from you.

00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:12.393
And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke.

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:15.472
On the morning of the stroke,

00:06:15.496 --> 00:06:19.795
I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye.

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:24.630
And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream.

00:06:24.654 --> 00:06:26.499
And it just gripped me --

00:06:26.523 --> 00:06:28.734
and then it released me.

00:06:28.758 --> 00:06:30.869
And then it just gripped me --

00:06:30.893 --> 00:06:32.620
and then it released me.

00:06:32.644 --> 00:06:36.976
And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.572
so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine."

00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:41.976
So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.976
which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine.

00:06:46.215 --> 00:06:48.425
And I'm jamming away on this thing,

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.218
and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws

00:06:53.242 --> 00:06:55.710
grasping onto the bar.

00:06:55.734 --> 00:06:57.725
And I thought, "That's very peculiar."

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:59.205
And I looked down at my body

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:02.976
and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing."

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.666
And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.163
from my normal perception of reality,

00:07:08.187 --> 00:07:11.164
where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience,

00:07:11.188 --> 00:07:13.086
to some esoteric space

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.199
where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:20.220
And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse.

00:07:20.244 --> 00:07:21.543
So I get off the machine,

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:23.976
and I'm walking
across my living room floor,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.642
and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down.

00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:32.102
And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate.

00:07:32.126 --> 00:07:34.975
There's no fluidity to my pace,

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:37.927
and there's this constriction
in my area of perception,

00:07:37.951 --> 00:07:40.976
so I'm just focused on internal systems.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.531
And I'm standing in my bathroom

00:07:42.555 --> 00:07:44.402
getting ready to step into the shower,

00:07:44.426 --> 00:07:47.175
and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:50.976
I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.388
You muscles, you relax."

00:07:52.412 --> 00:07:56.546
And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.515
And I look down at my arm

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:03.972
and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body.

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:07.784
I can't define where I begin
and where I end,

00:08:07.808 --> 00:08:09.976
because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.976
blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.976
And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.143
And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me?

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:21.946
What is going on?"

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:27.387
And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent.

00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:31.683
Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button.

00:08:31.707 --> 00:08:32.976
Total silence.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.333
And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind.

00:08:38.357 --> 00:08:41.596
But then I was immediately captivated

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.380
by the magnificence
of the energy around me.

00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:49.278
And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body,

00:08:49.302 --> 00:08:52.840
I felt enormous and expansive.

00:08:52.864 --> 00:08:56.189
I felt at one with
all the energy that was,

00:08:56.213 --> 00:08:58.379
and it was beautiful there.

00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:01.245
Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:03.476
and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem!

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.000
We've got to get some help."

00:09:05.024 --> 00:09:07.052
And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!"

00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:08.603
(Laughter)

00:09:08.627 --> 00:09:10.618
So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem."

00:09:10.642 --> 00:09:15.141
But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness --

00:09:15.165 --> 00:09:19.000
and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land.

00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:21.382
But it was beautiful there.

00:09:21.406 --> 00:09:24.404
Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected

00:09:24.428 --> 00:09:27.976
from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.842
So here I am in this space,

00:09:29.866 --> 00:09:33.976
and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.317
And I felt lighter in my body.

00:09:37.873 --> 00:09:40.976
And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.976
and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone.

00:09:44.396 --> 00:09:47.174
And I felt this sense of peacefulness.

00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:50.635
And imagine
what it would feel like to lose

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:54.397
37 years of emotional baggage!

00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:59.976
(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria --

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.851
euphoria.

00:10:01.875 --> 00:10:02.976
It was beautiful.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.626
And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says,

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.276
"Hey! You've got to pay attention.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.698
We've got to get help."

00:10:08.722 --> 00:10:11.577
And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus."

00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:14.069
So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress

00:10:14.093 --> 00:10:15.900
and I'm walking around my apartment,

00:10:15.924 --> 00:10:19.976
and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?"

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.269
And in that moment,

00:10:21.293 --> 00:10:23.635
my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side.

00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:27.976
Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!"

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.619
And the next thing my brain says to me is,

00:10:30.643 --> 00:10:33.009
Wow! This is so cool!

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:34.977
(Laughter)

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.564
This is so cool!

00:10:36.588 --> 00:10:39.143
How many brain scientists
have the opportunity

00:10:39.167 --> 00:10:41.976
to study their own brain
from the inside out?"

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.976
(Laughter)

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.976
And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!"

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.150
(Laughter)

00:10:49.174 --> 00:10:51.341
"I don't have time for a stroke!"

00:10:51.365 --> 00:10:54.067
So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening,

00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:57.976
so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.452
So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work."

00:11:00.476 --> 00:11:02.376
I couldn't remember the number at work,

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.169
so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number.

00:11:06.193 --> 00:11:10.502
So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards.

00:11:10.526 --> 00:11:12.183
And I'm looking at the card on top

00:11:12.207 --> 00:11:15.541
and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye

00:11:15.565 --> 00:11:17.276
what my business card looked like,

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.888
I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not,

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:21.778
because all I could see were pixels.

00:11:21.802 --> 00:11:25.882
And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background

00:11:25.906 --> 00:11:29.214
and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell.

00:11:29.238 --> 00:11:32.378
And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity.

00:11:32.402 --> 00:11:36.690
And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality

00:11:36.714 --> 00:11:40.864
and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card.

00:11:40.888 --> 00:11:46.896
It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.794
In the meantime, for 45 minutes,

00:11:48.818 --> 00:11:51.476
the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.500
I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone,

00:11:54.524 --> 00:11:56.076
but it's the only plan I have.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.785
So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here.

00:11:58.809 --> 00:12:01.191
I take the business card,
I put it right here,

00:12:01.215 --> 00:12:04.976
and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.317
to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad.

00:12:08.341 --> 00:12:10.976
But then I would drift back out
into La La Land,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.976
and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.976
So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.976
and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.690
so that as I would come back
to normal reality,

00:12:25.714 --> 00:12:29.722
I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number."

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:34.086
Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone,

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.747
and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me,

00:12:37.697 --> 00:12:39.340
"Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter)

00:12:39.364 --> 00:12:42.799
(Laughter)

00:12:42.823 --> 00:12:44.673
And I think to myself,

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:47.736
"Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!"

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.387
(Laughter)

00:12:49.411 --> 00:12:52.572
And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him:

00:12:52.596 --> 00:12:54.238
"This is Jill! I need help!"

00:12:54.262 --> 00:12:57.976
And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo."

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.810
I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever."

00:13:00.834 --> 00:13:02.755
So I couldn't know -- I didn't know

00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:06.405
that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried.

00:13:06.429 --> 00:13:09.809
So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help.

00:13:10.111 --> 00:13:13.721
And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance

00:13:13.745 --> 00:13:17.300
from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.

00:13:18.157 --> 00:13:20.490
And I curl up into a little fetal ball.

00:13:21.331 --> 00:13:27.879
And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air,

00:13:27.903 --> 00:13:30.053
just right out of the balloon,

00:13:30.077 --> 00:13:35.315
I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender.

00:13:35.965 --> 00:13:41.976
And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.393
And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life,

00:13:46.417 --> 00:13:50.079
or this was perhaps
my moment of transition.

00:13:54.719 --> 00:13:56.926
When I woke later that afternoon,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.600
I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive.

00:14:02.045 --> 00:14:06.976
When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.325
And my mind was now suspended

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:13.547
between two very opposite
planes of reality.

00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:16.858
Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems

00:14:16.882 --> 00:14:18.595
felt like pure pain.

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:22.372
Light burned my brain like wildfire,

00:14:22.396 --> 00:14:25.991
and sounds were so loud and chaotic

00:14:26.015 --> 00:14:30.197
that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise,

00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:32.189
and I just wanted to escape.

00:14:32.818 --> 00:14:37.962
Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space,

00:14:37.986 --> 00:14:41.803
I felt enormous and expansive,

00:14:41.827 --> 00:14:45.398
like a genie just liberated
from her bottle.

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:49.326
And my spirit soared free,

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:55.000
like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria.

00:14:56.555 --> 00:14:58.239
Nirvana.

00:14:58.263 --> 00:15:00.683
I found Nirvana.

00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:04.381
And I remember thinking,

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:08.835
there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself

00:15:08.859 --> 00:15:11.373
back inside this tiny little body.

00:15:13.817 --> 00:15:17.325
But then I realized, "But I'm still alive!

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:20.452
I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.

00:15:20.476 --> 00:15:24.182
And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive,

00:15:24.206 --> 00:15:28.158
then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana."

00:15:30.428 --> 00:15:31.699
And I pictured a world

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:37.683
filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people

00:15:37.707 --> 00:15:41.453
who knew that they could come
to this space at any time.

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:45.650
And that they could purposely choose

00:15:45.674 --> 00:15:48.467
to step to the right
of their left hemispheres --

00:15:50.071 --> 00:15:51.976
and find this peace.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.223
And then I realized

00:15:53.247 --> 00:15:56.804
what a tremendous gift
this experience could be,

00:15:56.828 --> 00:16:02.723
what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives.

00:16:04.104 --> 00:16:06.627
And it motivated me to recover.

00:16:09.929 --> 00:16:14.079
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in,

00:16:14.103 --> 00:16:16.651
and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:18.666
that was pushing on my language centers.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.316
Here I am with my mama,

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.245
who is a true angel in my life.

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:27.419
It took me eight years
to completely recover.

00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:30.703
So who are we?

00:16:30.727 --> 00:16:35.729
We are the life-force power
of the universe,

00:16:35.753 --> 00:16:40.050
with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds.

00:16:40.626 --> 00:16:43.927
And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment,

00:16:43.951 --> 00:16:46.939
who and how we want to be in the world.

00:16:47.653 --> 00:16:49.208
Right here, right now,

00:16:49.232 --> 00:16:54.458
I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are.

00:16:54.482 --> 00:16:57.539
I am the life-force power of the universe.

00:16:57.563 --> 00:16:59.103
I am the life-force power

00:16:59.127 --> 00:17:03.961
of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form,

00:17:03.985 --> 00:17:06.261
at one with all that is.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.344
Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere,

00:17:12.368 --> 00:17:15.649
where I become
a single individual, a solid.

00:17:15.673 --> 00:17:19.232
Separate from the flow, separate from you.

00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:21.366
I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.219
intellectual, neuroanatomist.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:29.889
These are the "we" inside of me.

00:17:31.484 --> 00:17:32.984
Which would you choose?

00:17:35.523 --> 00:17:37.209
Which do you choose?

00:17:38.837 --> 00:17:40.137
And when?

00:17:42.777 --> 00:17:44.976
I believe that the more time we spend

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.977
choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry

00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:50.221
of our right hemispheres,

00:17:50.245 --> 00:17:53.551
the more peace we will project
into the world,

00:17:53.575 --> 00:17:56.107
and the more peaceful our planet will be.

00:17:57.198 --> 00:18:00.265
And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.076
Thank you.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.100
(Applause)
