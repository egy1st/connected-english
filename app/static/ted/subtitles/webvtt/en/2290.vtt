00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:07.998
There were people running,
screaming, fire, spears.

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:11.217
The city was being invaded.

00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:15.310
But it seemed like he didn't care.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.822
He was still sitting, drawing
mathematical shapes in the sand.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:24.187
Until a Roman soldier threatened him
with his sword

00:00:24.187 --> 00:00:26.194
and wanted to capture him.

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:31.391
The old man, calmly, raised his eyes,
looked at him,

00:00:33.446 --> 00:00:37.100
and told him that firstly
he would finish his demonstration.

00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:41.060
Then he looked down
and kept drawing in the sand.

00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:47.507
When Romans invaded Sicily,
Syracuse seemed an easy target.

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:52.045
However, it took them
more than two years to conquer it.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.459
It was the first battle in which
technology made a difference.

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:58.513
Catapults and big cranes were used

00:00:58.548 --> 00:01:00.590
to spin ships up in the air,

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:02.917
and many other innovations.

00:01:04.808 --> 00:01:08.379
Plutarch says that Romans were so scared

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:12.974
that they saw a rope or a pulley
and started running.

00:01:13.437 --> 00:01:17.475
All those inventions were the work
of only one man.

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:21.208
Who was that giant who,
with his inventions,

00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:23.860
made the Roman army tremble?

00:01:24.527 --> 00:01:27.551
None less than Archimedes,

00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:32.715
the most important mathematician
of Antiquity.

00:01:33.787 --> 00:01:36.524
Finally, the Romans conquered the city.

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:40.596
The soldier was obviously upset
with Archimedes' attitude,

00:01:40.847 --> 00:01:42.584
and killed him with his sword.

00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:48.182
A terrible mistake for which
he paid a very high price,

00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:51.737
because his General,
Marcus Claudius Marcellus,

00:01:51.772 --> 00:01:54.298
deeply admired Archimedes.

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:58.786
In fact, Marcus Claudius,
while he could have taken

00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:03.820
all the treasures of the city,
he chose one that fitted in any bag.

00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:08.806
A device made by Archimedes.

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:14.165
Cicero says it was
a kind of portable planetary,

00:02:14.907 --> 00:02:18.308
that showed the position of the Sun,
the Moon, the stars;

00:02:18.623 --> 00:02:22.534
and when he made it work,
it predicted eclipses.

00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:29.559
How could this portable planetary be?

00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:33.169
Cicero says he never
thought that a human being

00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:36.553
could be such a genius
to do something like this.

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:42.415
The Roman general chose it
before any other treasure.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.671
How could it have been?

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:48.755
Can you imagine what was it like
to have it in your hands?

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:53.265
Having the chance to study it,
investigate it, touch it?

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:57.418
However, as many ancient marvels,

00:02:58.107 --> 00:03:00.380
it was lost forever.

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:05.094
Or at least it seemed so,
because in 1900 a sunken ship was found

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:08.604
at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea,
close to Antikytheras island

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.148
full of treasures from the Greeks' time:

00:03:11.183 --> 00:03:15.801
statues, jewelry, coins
and something quite odd.

00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:22.406
This: a bunch of spare parts
of what looked like

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.469
an ancient clock full of gears.

00:03:26.808 --> 00:03:30.631
This in itself was quite revolutionary
because devices like this

00:03:30.666 --> 00:03:35.467
appear in the late Middle Ages,
1500 years later.

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:44.510
Could they be the remains
of Archimedes' device?

00:03:45.173 --> 00:03:48.006
To answer this question
we would have to first rebuild

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:51.770
the original device from the parts
and make it work again.

00:03:52.043 --> 00:03:57.119
A Quixotic challenge
that is taking more than a century.

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:00.894
In the 50's, an American named
Solla Price worked on it;

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:04.386
And then two British men:
Michael Wright in the 90's,

00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:08.068
and Tony Freeth and his team in 2000.

00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:13.507
Freeth's team made extremely
high resolution CT scans

00:04:14.872 --> 00:04:17.178
that let us see the interior
of the fragments.

00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:19.629
See for yourselves.

00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:24.170
We start from the outside and little
by little we enter the fragment.

00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:26.664
This is really important
because in the Museum

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.107
we are not allowed to break the device
to see what is inside.

00:04:31.365 --> 00:04:33.344
Look at those teeth,

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:37.011
look how they are conserved after
2000 years underwater.

00:04:37.046 --> 00:04:40.546
Now we are advertising the first
submersible tablets.

00:04:40.807 --> 00:04:43.993
This is submersible!
2000 years underwater!

00:04:44.028 --> 00:04:47.228
Look at it: it's crazy.

00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:53.625
According to what we could rebuild so far,

00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:56.565
the mechanism was protected
by a wooden box

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.799
and had a cover at the front
and a cover at the back.

00:05:00.097 --> 00:05:03.791
At the front, it had two
concentric scales:

00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:08.021
one was divided
by the twelve zodiac signs

00:05:08.056 --> 00:05:11.264
and the other one
by the 365 days of the year.

00:05:12.156 --> 00:05:15.873
Over these scales, a needle spins
and shows at the same time

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.326
the position of the Sun in the sky
and the day of the year.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.362
But over those scales
there is also another needle

00:05:23.362 --> 00:05:26.116
that shows the position
of the Moon in the sky.

00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:32.543
The mistake of that needle,
according to current values,

00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:36.791
Is 0.0002 days per turn.

00:05:40.255 --> 00:05:41.436
But that's not all.

00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:44.464
The Moon doesn't move
at a constant speed.

00:05:45.488 --> 00:05:49.284
Sometimes it goes faster
and sometimes slower.

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:52.481
These guys could keep the Moon needle

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:55.688
from going at a constant speed,
so that it speeds up

00:05:55.723 --> 00:06:00.480
when the Moon goes faster
and slows down when it goes slower.

00:06:01.964 --> 00:06:05.577
And as if it wasn't enough,
the Moon's needle

00:06:05.612 --> 00:06:09.188
had a little ball painted
half black and half white,

00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:12.139
that spun showing
the phases of the Moon.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.774
If you ask me, only Archimedes
could have done something like this.

00:06:25.162 --> 00:06:29.089
At the back we have two big spiral clocks.

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:35.172
The first one is an eclipse predictor.

00:06:36.398 --> 00:06:40.482
Do you remember that Cicero said
Archimedes' clock predicted eclipses?

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:44.337
Eclipses repeat themselves
every 223 months.

00:06:44.688 --> 00:06:48.129
For each one there is a cell,
most of them are empty.

00:06:48.164 --> 00:06:52.831
But when there's an eclipse,
the cell informs if it is solar or lunar,

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:57.557
if it would be observable
and even when it would happen.

00:07:00.543 --> 00:07:04.122
The one above has two
little clocks inside.

00:07:05.056 --> 00:07:08.357
One of them makes a complete turn
every four years

00:07:08.392 --> 00:07:12.457
and showed the user when
the Olympics would take place.

00:07:12.815 --> 00:07:15.516
(Laughter)

00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:21.051
The big spiral is a lunisolar calendar.

00:07:21.588 --> 00:07:24.698
that divides 235 months in 19 years.

00:07:25.372 --> 00:07:27.662
It's an extremely accurate calendar.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:31.447
We have to add a day every four years
to our calendar

00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:34.671
on the leap years,
so it doesn't disarrange.

00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:39.542
To this calendar,
we have to remove a day every 76 years.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:41.890
Of course, we can say:

00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:45.943
Who is going to remember to remove
a year every 7 decades?

00:07:46.155 --> 00:07:49.504
To do that, the mechanism
had another little clock

00:07:49.703 --> 00:07:52.578
that took one turn every 76 years

00:07:52.613 --> 00:07:56.014
to remind the user
that he had to skip a day.

00:07:58.288 --> 00:08:01.756
The calendar has the names of the months

00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:05.578
and that was very important
because every Greek city

00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:08.090
had its own calendar with its own names.

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:12.455
And we could determine
that the calendar of the mechanism

00:08:13.022 --> 00:08:17.511
matches with the Corinth calendar
or that of its colonies.

00:08:18.495 --> 00:08:23.062
Do you know which city was a colony
of Corinth for a long time?

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:26.752
Syracuse, Archimedes' city.

00:08:28.932 --> 00:08:31.877
Is this then Archimedes device?

00:08:34.272 --> 00:08:38.178
Truth is Archimedes'
and Antikytheras' device

00:08:38.614 --> 00:08:41.707
cast the same type of spell

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.716
on those who get in touch with them.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.226
We know that the Roman General
was haunted when he saw it

00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:53.442
and he chose it over any treasure.

00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:58.221
Something similar to what happens
to Gollum in The Lord of the Rings

00:08:58.487 --> 00:09:00.797
with Frodo's ring.

00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:05.552
Cicero was also amazed when he saw it work

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.407
and became Archimedes' fan.

00:09:07.442 --> 00:09:11.049
Archimedes' mechanism
had that kind of charm.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.212
But a very similar one has Antikytheras'.

00:09:14.247 --> 00:09:16.768
Solla Price, once he saw the fragments,

00:09:16.803 --> 00:09:19.386
worked with them until he died.

00:09:19.762 --> 00:09:24.020
Michael Wright was almost fired
for investigating this device.

00:09:25.153 --> 00:09:29.523
Tony Freeth mortgaged his economic
future for the investigation.

00:09:31.683 --> 00:09:35.789
I myself have to confess
that I fell under its spell.

00:09:37.238 --> 00:09:41.133
And I've been working on it
for 5 years nonstop.

00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:48.882
I remember the first time I saw
the fragments at the museum in Athens

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:56.125
I was hypnotized, I couldn't stop
looking at them.

00:09:57.437 --> 00:10:01.696
I must have spent several hours
watching the fragments

00:10:02.032 --> 00:10:04.389
from every possible angle.

00:10:04.682 --> 00:10:07.277
Until the museum's security got nervous

00:10:07.312 --> 00:10:09.213
thinking I wanted to steal it.

00:10:09.248 --> 00:10:11.776
And actually, I wanted to!

00:10:13.172 --> 00:10:15.653
But it's not just its spell

00:10:15.688 --> 00:10:19.215
what makes us suspect
it's the same device.

00:10:19.617 --> 00:10:21.962
There are several signs
pointing at Archimedes:

00:10:21.997 --> 00:10:25.149
it could be Syracuse's calendar,

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:31.256
Ciceros description matches a lot
with what we could rebuild,

00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:34.520
the eclipses predictor
also leads to Archimedes.

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:39.142
However, there's still
a very important proof missing.

00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:41.859
Without that, we have nothing.

00:10:42.233 --> 00:10:45.731
It's the mechanism's construction date.

00:10:46.827 --> 00:10:50.334
To give it a date, we tried to study
the shape of letters,

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:53.383
of the script, but the margin
of error is too big,

00:10:53.418 --> 00:10:55.614
more than a hundred years.

00:10:56.498 --> 00:10:58.986
Carbon-14 only works on organic material

00:10:59.021 --> 00:11:01.534
and the gears are made of bronze.

00:11:01.793 --> 00:11:04.014
But there's another chance.

00:11:04.267 --> 00:11:07.095
In the eclipse predictor we have the hours

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.798
and the days in which
eclipses will happen.

00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:13.797
If we found the series of eclipses
that better fit these data,

00:11:14.197 --> 00:11:16.746
we would know when it was built.

00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:21.238
This proposal is valid in theory
but never worked in practice

00:11:21.548 --> 00:11:24.231
because there is a lot of data
of the eclipse predictor

00:11:24.231 --> 00:11:26.570
that we don't come to understand well.

00:11:26.605 --> 00:11:31.079
Something very annoying is that
while it predicts every lunar eclipse,

00:11:31.396 --> 00:11:34.700
it only predicts some
of the solar eclipses.

00:11:35.977 --> 00:11:38.475
For some reason, the person
who made the device

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.540
decided to skip some solar eclipses.

00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:46.414
Those forgotten eclipses
don't seem to follow any logic,

00:11:48.196 --> 00:11:50.354
they seem randomly skipped.

00:11:52.989 --> 00:11:55.617
They are those red eclipses there.

00:11:58.098 --> 00:12:01.674
One evening after working
with the CT scans,

00:12:02.494 --> 00:12:05.881
I simply thought about
relocating the eclipses

00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:09.630
from the spiral below to the spiral above

00:12:09.888 --> 00:12:12.133
to see how they would fit.

00:12:12.374 --> 00:12:14.998
I didn't have any reason
to do it, I just did it.

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.990
And look what happened.

00:12:20.895 --> 00:12:22.498
It seemed magical.

00:12:22.697 --> 00:12:25.745
Suddenly all the eclipses
organized in forming rays,

00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:29.287
and what's most important,
those skipped eclipses,

00:12:30.275 --> 00:12:33.005
formed two very defined rays.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.760
I have found the logic
of this eclipse skipping.

00:12:39.711 --> 00:12:42.756
I communicated this to my
research partner, James Evans

00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:46.318
and he immediately understood
what it was about.

00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:51.748
That gave us a lot of information
about the eclipse predictor.

00:12:53.302 --> 00:12:57.523
Maybe now we could find
the date of construction.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.841
We started working immediately.

00:13:01.876 --> 00:13:05.460
It was years and years
of burning our heads.

00:13:07.655 --> 00:13:10.528
Of following dead-end strategies.

00:13:12.278 --> 00:13:15.245
Of getting excited with a result
to later realize

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.109
that we had made some silly mistake
with calculations.

00:13:19.144 --> 00:13:22.344
Until one Sunday of February,
last year,

00:13:24.957 --> 00:13:28.118
I was at my colleagues house in the US

00:13:30.295 --> 00:13:33.938
and we realized that there was
no way to move forward.

00:13:33.973 --> 00:13:37.135
That even using all the data we had,

00:13:37.492 --> 00:13:39.976
we had too many possible dates.

00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:45.164
I remember that day, we said goodbye
with the bitter feeling

00:13:45.381 --> 00:13:49.756
that the project that was taking
more than three years had failed.

00:13:52.366 --> 00:13:54.428
I couldn't believe it.

00:13:54.777 --> 00:13:58.285
I kept myself together in front of him
but when I went down the stairs -

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.500
I was sleeping in his basement,
which was full of books

00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:06.250
on the history of Astronomy,
it's spectacular -

00:14:06.285 --> 00:14:10.678
when I went downstairs and I sat
on the bed, I couldn't believe it.

00:14:11.933 --> 00:14:13.074
I couldn't mourn.

00:14:13.074 --> 00:14:17.350
So many years working
and we didn't find anything.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.817
I started to revise,
to make the calculations again,

00:14:25.136 --> 00:14:27.357
I reviewed everything.

00:14:27.392 --> 00:14:31.482
Until suddenly I thought
about considering data

00:14:31.941 --> 00:14:34.402
about the lunar anomaly
we hadn't considered.

00:14:34.437 --> 00:14:37.363
And that data was extremely powerful.

00:14:38.733 --> 00:14:42.389
I did the calculation
and it eliminated all but one candidate.

00:14:42.662 --> 00:14:44.655
That night we found the result.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.431
And we were about to quit!

00:14:47.867 --> 00:14:50.700
And we were very close to the solution.

00:14:53.617 --> 00:14:57.537
Today, after one year and a half
of reviewing carefully

00:14:58.468 --> 00:15:01.430
every calculation and checking all data,

00:15:02.671 --> 00:15:06.737
I can officially announce
that the first eclipse of the device

00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:13.253
happened on June 25th, 205 B.C,
at 15:35, Athens local time.

00:15:16.692 --> 00:15:21.433
(Applause)

00:15:33.036 --> 00:15:37.629
That means that the calendar
could have started in September or August

00:15:38.102 --> 00:15:42.044
of 216 B.C., when Archimedes was still -

00:15:42.411 --> 00:15:44.252
our dearest Archimedes -

00:15:44.287 --> 00:15:46.355
alive and kicking.

00:15:46.677 --> 00:15:48.109
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:48.109 --> 00:15:52.174
this mechanism might have been made
by Archimedes himself.

00:15:56.028 --> 00:15:59.510
I imagine you will arrive home today

00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:03.504
and you will start looking up
information on the Internet,

00:16:04.495 --> 00:16:06.974
if you aren't doing it already.

00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:09.944
You can do it, there is a lot,

00:16:11.047 --> 00:16:15.299
but if you suddenly realize
that you've spent the last 10 hours

00:16:15.497 --> 00:16:17.630
in front of the computer,

00:16:18.128 --> 00:16:20.709
that you forgot to have dinner or lunch,

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.949
or that you skipped work, be careful.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.610
Be careful.

00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:30.907
Maybe it's too late and you have fallen,

00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:34.993
like many of us, under its spell.

00:16:37.926 --> 00:16:40.196
(Applause)
