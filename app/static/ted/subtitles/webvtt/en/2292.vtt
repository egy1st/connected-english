00:00:00.597 --> 00:00:02.478
When you're a child,

00:00:02.478 --> 00:00:06.077
anything and everything is possible.

00:00:06.147 --> 00:00:10.186
The challenge, so often,
is hanging on to that as we grow up.

00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:12.181
And as a four-year-old,

00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:14.841
I had the opportunity
to sail for the first time.

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:19.878
I will never forget
the excitement as we closed the coast.

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:21.643
I will never forget

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:24.638
the feeling of adventure
as I climbed on board the boat

00:00:24.638 --> 00:00:28.280
and stared into her tiny cabin
for the first time.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.488
But the most amazing feeling
was the feeling of freedom,

00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:35.226
the feeling that I felt
when we hoisted her sails.

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:37.600
As a four-year-old child,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.449
it was the greatest sense of freedom
that I could ever imagine.

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.792
I made my mind up there and then
that one day, somehow,

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:47.850
I was going to sail around the world.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.360
So I did what I could in my life
to get closer to that dream.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.426
Age 10, it was saving my school
dinner money change.

00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:59.344
Every single day for eight years,
I had mashed potato and baked beans,

00:00:59.344 --> 00:01:01.997
which cost 4p each, and gravy was free.

00:01:01.997 --> 00:01:05.014
Every day I would pile up the change
on the top of my money box,

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:07.604
and when that pile reached a pound,
I would drop it in

00:01:07.604 --> 00:01:12.167
and cross off one of the 100 squares
I'd drawn on a piece of paper.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:15.418
Finally, I bought a tiny dinghy.

00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:19.381
I spent hours sitting on it in the garden
dreaming of my goal.

00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:22.500
I read every book I could on sailing,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.495
and then eventually,
having been told by my school

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:27.771
I wasn't clever enough to be a vet,

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:32.454
left school age 17 to begin
my apprenticeship in sailing.

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:36.830
So imagine how it felt
just four years later

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.506
to be sitting in a boardroom

00:01:38.506 --> 00:01:42.515
in front of someone who I knew
could make that dream come true.

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:46.003
I felt like my life
depended on that moment,

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:48.644
and incredibly, he said yes.

00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:52.754
And I could barely contain my excitement
as I sat in that first design meeting

00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:55.564
designing a boat
on which I was going to sail

00:01:55.564 --> 00:01:58.443
solo nonstop around the world.

00:01:58.443 --> 00:02:01.299
From that first meeting
to the finish line of the race,

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.597
it was everything I'd ever imagined.

00:02:03.597 --> 00:02:07.498
Just like in my dreams, there were
amazing parts and tough parts.

00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:09.658
We missed an iceberg by 20 feet.

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:12.931
Nine times, I climbed to the top
of her 90-foot mast.

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.300
We were blown on our side
in the Southern Ocean.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.272
But the sunsets, the wildlife,
and the remoteness

00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:21.597
were absolutely breathtaking.

00:02:21.857 --> 00:02:24.504
After three months at sea, age just 24,

00:02:24.504 --> 00:02:26.799
I finished in second position.

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.750
I'd loved it, so much so
that within six months

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.326
I decided to go around the world again,
but this time not in a race:

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:40.214
to try to be the fastest person ever
to sail solo nonstop around the world.

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.650
Now for this, I needed a different craft:

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.244
bigger, wider, faster, more powerful.

00:02:47.244 --> 00:02:50.959
Just to give that boat some scale,
I could climb inside her mast

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.863
all the way to the top.

00:02:52.863 --> 00:02:55.973
Seventy-five foot long, 60 foot wide.

00:02:56.253 --> 00:02:58.372
I affectionately called her Moby.

00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:00.131
She was a multihull.

00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.892
When we built her, no one had ever
made it solo nonstop

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.191
around the world in one,
though many had tried,

00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:11.063
but whilst we built her, a Frenchman
took a boat 25 percent bigger than her

00:03:11.063 --> 00:03:14.852
and not only did he make it,
but he took the record from 93 days

00:03:14.852 --> 00:03:17.348
right down to 72.

00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:20.155
The bar was now much, much higher.

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:22.105
And these boats were exciting to sail.

00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:25.472
This was a training sail
off the French coast.

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:29.187
This I know well because I was one
of the five crew members on board.

00:03:29.187 --> 00:03:33.538
Five seconds is all it took
from everything being fine

00:03:33.538 --> 00:03:36.617
to our world going black
as the windows were thrust underwater,

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:38.776
and that five seconds goes quickly.

00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:41.679
Just see how far below
those guys the sea is.

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:45.792
Imagine that alone
in the Southern Ocean

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:49.950
plunged into icy water,
thousands of miles away from land.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.560
It was Christmas Day.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.933
I was forging into the Southern Ocean
underneath Australia.

00:03:56.933 --> 00:03:59.550
The conditions were horrendous.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.531
I was approaching a part in the ocean

00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:05.432
which was 2,000 miles away
from the nearest town.

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:08.311
The nearest land was Antarctica,
and the nearest people

00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:11.180
would be those manning
the European Space Station above me.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.560
(Laughter)

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.369
You really are in the middle of nowhere.

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.180
If you need help,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.736
and you're still alive,

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:21.731
it takes four days
for a ship to get to you

00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:25.145
and then four days for that ship
to get you back to port.

00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:27.466
No helicopter can reach you out there,

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:29.310
and no plane can land.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.584
We are forging ahead of a huge storm.

00:04:32.944 --> 00:04:35.370
Within it, there was 80 knots of wind,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.296
which was far too much wind
for the boat and I to cope with.

00:04:38.296 --> 00:04:41.337
The waves were already 40 to 50 feet high,

00:04:41.337 --> 00:04:43.427
and the spray from the breaking crests

00:04:43.427 --> 00:04:46.492
was blown horizontally
like snow in a blizzard.

00:04:46.492 --> 00:04:50.370
If we didn't sail fast enough,
we'd be engulfed by that storm,

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.527
and either capsized or smashed to pieces.

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:56.314
We were quite literally
hanging on for our lives

00:04:56.314 --> 00:04:59.518
and doing so on a knife edge.

00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:03.351
The speed I so desperately needed
brought with it danger.

00:05:03.351 --> 00:05:07.575
We all know what it's like driving a car
20 miles an hour, 30, 40.

00:05:07.575 --> 00:05:10.454
It's not too stressful.
We can concentrate.

00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:12.242
We can turn on the radio.

00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:16.700
Take that 50, 60, 70, accelerate through
to 80, 90, 100 miles an hour.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.974
Now you have white knuckles
and you're gripping the steering wheel.

00:05:19.974 --> 00:05:22.537
Now take that car off road at night

00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:24.873
and remove the windscreen wipers,
the windscreen,

00:05:24.873 --> 00:05:26.498
the headlights and the brakes.

00:05:26.498 --> 00:05:28.704
That's what it's like
in the Southern Ocean.

00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:32.192
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:33.172 --> 00:05:34.041
You could imagine

00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:36.831
it would be quite difficult
to sleep in that situation,

00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:38.511
even as a passenger.

00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:40.306
But you're not a passenger.

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:42.705
You're alone on a boat
you can barely stand up in,

00:05:42.705 --> 00:05:45.213
and you have to make
every single decision on board.

00:05:45.213 --> 00:05:48.487
I was absolutely exhausted,
physically and mentally.

00:05:48.487 --> 00:05:50.600
Eight sail changes in 12 hours.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.130
The mainsail weighed
three times my body weight,

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.827
and after each change,

00:05:54.827 --> 00:05:57.124
I would collapse on the floor
soaked with sweat

00:05:57.124 --> 00:06:01.721
with this freezing Southern Ocean air
burning the back of my throat.

00:06:01.721 --> 00:06:04.276
But out there, those lowest of the lows

00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:07.596
are so often contrasted
with the highest of the highs.

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:11.659
A few days later, we came out
of the back of the low.

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:15.397
Against all odds, we'd been able
to drive ahead of the record

00:06:15.397 --> 00:06:17.464
within that depression.

00:06:17.464 --> 00:06:20.250
The sky cleared, the rain stopped,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.569
and our heartbeat, the monstrous
seas around us were transformed

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.168
into the most beautiful moonlit mountains.

00:06:28.168 --> 00:06:32.765
It's hard to explain, but you enter
a different mode when you head out there.

00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:34.750
Your boat is your entire world,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.595
and what you take with you
when you leave is all you have.

00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:40.612
If I said to you all now,
"Go off into Vancouver

00:06:40.612 --> 00:06:44.348
and find everything you will need for
your survival for the next three months,"

00:06:44.348 --> 00:06:46.116
that's quite a task.

00:06:46.116 --> 00:06:48.554
That's food, fuel, clothes,

00:06:48.554 --> 00:06:50.969
even toilet roll and toothpaste.

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:52.432
That's what we do,

00:06:52.432 --> 00:06:54.336
and when we leave we manage it

00:06:54.336 --> 00:06:58.000
down to the last drop of diesel
and the last packet of food.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.833
No experience in my life

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:03.740
could have given me a better understanding
of the definition of the word "finite."

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.852
What we have out there is all we have.

00:07:05.852 --> 00:07:07.571
There is no more.

00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:10.891
And never in my life had I ever
translated that definition of finite

00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:14.211
that I'd felt on board
to anything outside of sailing

00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:18.809
until I stepped off the boat at
the finish line having broken that record.

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.955
(Applause)

00:07:24.265 --> 00:07:26.935
Suddenly I connected the dots.

00:07:26.935 --> 00:07:29.164
Our global economy is no different.

00:07:29.774 --> 00:07:32.276
It's entirely dependent
on finite materials

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:34.864
we only have once
in the history of humanity.

00:07:34.864 --> 00:07:38.638
And it was a bit like seeing something
you weren't expecting under a stone

00:07:38.638 --> 00:07:40.147
and having two choices:

00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:42.701
I either put that stone to one side

00:07:42.701 --> 00:07:46.114
and learn more about it,
or I put that stone back

00:07:46.114 --> 00:07:49.876
and I carry on with my dream job
of sailing around the world.

00:07:50.526 --> 00:07:52.128
I chose the first.

00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:55.611
I put it to one side and I began
a new journey of learning,

00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:59.117
speaking to chief executives,
experts, scientists, economists

00:07:59.117 --> 00:08:02.739
to try to understand just how
our global economy works.

00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:06.431
And my curiosity took me
to some extraordinary places.

00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:09.983
This photo was taken in the burner
of a coal-fired power station.

00:08:11.183 --> 00:08:14.317
I was fascinated by coal,
fundamental to our global energy needs,

00:08:14.317 --> 00:08:17.274
but also very close to my family.

00:08:17.274 --> 00:08:19.280
My great-grandfather was a coal miner,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.600
and he spent 50 years
of his life underground.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.315
This is a photo of him,
and when you see that photo,

00:08:26.315 --> 00:08:28.480
you see someone from another era.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.818
No one wears trousers
with a waistband quite that high

00:08:31.818 --> 00:08:34.303
in this day and age. (Laughter)

00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:36.973
But yet, that's me
with my great-grandfather,

00:08:36.973 --> 00:08:41.106
and by the way, they are not
his real ears. (Laughter)

00:08:41.106 --> 00:08:45.564
We were close. I remember sitting on
his knee listening to his mining stories.

00:08:45.564 --> 00:08:47.816
He talked of the camaraderie underground,

00:08:47.816 --> 00:08:51.253
and the fact that the miners used to save
the crusts of their sandwiches

00:08:51.253 --> 00:08:54.341
to give to the ponies
they worked with underground.

00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:56.732
It was like it was yesterday.

00:08:56.732 --> 00:08:58.520
And on my journey of learning,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.842
I went to the World
Coal Association website,

00:09:00.842 --> 00:09:03.164
and there in the middle
of the homepage, it said,

00:09:03.164 --> 00:09:06.322
"We have about 118 years of coal left."

00:09:06.322 --> 00:09:09.456
And I thought to myself, well,
that's well outside my lifetime,

00:09:09.456 --> 00:09:12.335
and a much greater figure
than the predictions for oil.

00:09:12.335 --> 00:09:15.400
But I did the math, and I realized
that my great-grandfather

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.974
had been born exactly 118 years
before that year,

00:09:19.974 --> 00:09:22.737
and I sat on his knee
until I was 11 years old,

00:09:22.737 --> 00:09:24.641
and I realized it's nothing

00:09:24.641 --> 00:09:26.963
in time, nor in history.

00:09:26.963 --> 00:09:30.121
And it made me make a decision
I never thought I would make:

00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:32.466
to leave the sport
of solo sailing behind me

00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:35.531
and focus on the greatest challenge
I'd ever come across:

00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:37.861
the future of our global economy.

00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:40.570
And I quickly realized it wasn't
just about energy.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.613
It was also materials.

00:09:42.613 --> 00:09:44.772
In 2008, I picked up a scientific study

00:09:44.772 --> 00:09:46.816
looking at how many years we have

00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:49.532
of valuable materials
to extract from the ground:

00:09:49.532 --> 00:09:53.921
copper, 61; tin, zinc, 40; silver, 29.

00:09:53.921 --> 00:09:57.937
These figures couldn't be exact,
but we knew those materials were finite.

00:09:57.937 --> 00:09:59.674
We only have them once.

00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:03.208
And yet, our speed that we've used
these materials has increased rapidly,

00:10:03.208 --> 00:10:04.950
exponentially.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.806
With more people in the world
with more stuff,

00:10:07.806 --> 00:10:10.580
we've effectively seen
100 years of price declines

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.425
in those basic commodities
erased in just 10 years.

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:15.212
And this affects all of us.

00:10:15.212 --> 00:10:17.232
It's brought huge volatility in prices,

00:10:17.232 --> 00:10:20.081
so much so that in 2011,

00:10:20.081 --> 00:10:22.619
your average European car manufacturer

00:10:22.619 --> 00:10:25.173
saw a raw material price increase

00:10:25.173 --> 00:10:27.379
of 500 million Euros,

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:29.701
wiping away half their operating profits

00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:33.260
through something they have
absolutely no control over.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.390
And the more I learned, the more
I started to change my own life.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.849
I started traveling less,
doing less, using less.

00:10:38.849 --> 00:10:42.390
It felt like actually doing less
was what we had to do.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.740
But it sat uneasy with me.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.862
It didn't feel right.

00:10:45.862 --> 00:10:48.358
It felt like we were
buying ourselves time.

00:10:48.358 --> 00:10:50.250
We were eking things out a bit longer.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.477
Even if everybody changed,
it wouldn't solve the problem.

00:10:53.477 --> 00:10:55.521
It wouldn't fix the system.

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:58.562
It was vital in the transition,
but what fascinated me was,

00:10:58.562 --> 00:11:02.951
in the transition to what?
What could actually work?

00:11:02.951 --> 00:11:07.246
It struck me that the system itself,
the framework within which we live,

00:11:07.246 --> 00:11:09.545
is fundamentally flawed,

00:11:09.545 --> 00:11:12.804
and I realized ultimately

00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:15.837
that our operating system,
the way our economy functions,

00:11:15.837 --> 00:11:19.320
the way our economy's been built,
is a system in itself.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.222
At sea, I had to understand
complex systems.

00:11:22.222 --> 00:11:24.100
I had to take multiple inputs,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.612
I had to process them,

00:11:25.612 --> 00:11:28.500
and I had to understand the system to win.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.233
I had to make sense of it.

00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:34.296
And as I looked at our global economy,
I realized it too is that system,

00:11:34.296 --> 00:11:38.708
but it's a system that effectively
can't run in the long term.

00:11:38.708 --> 00:11:42.469
And I realized we've been perfecting
what's effectively a linear economy

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:44.339
for 150 years,

00:11:44.339 --> 00:11:46.370
where we take a material
out of the ground,

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.878
we make something out of it,
and then ultimately

00:11:48.878 --> 00:11:52.152
that product gets thrown away,
and yes, we do recycle some of it,

00:11:52.152 --> 00:11:55.147
but more an attempt to get out
what we can at the end,

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:57.353
not by design.

00:11:57.353 --> 00:12:00.557
It's an economy that fundamentally
can't run in the long term,

00:12:00.557 --> 00:12:03.590
and if we know that we
have finite materials,

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.919
why would we build an economy
that would effectively use things up,

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:08.777
that would create waste?

00:12:08.777 --> 00:12:11.702
Life itself has existed
for billions of years

00:12:11.702 --> 00:12:15.324
and has continually adapted
to use materials effectively.

00:12:15.324 --> 00:12:18.645
It's a complex system,
but within it, there is no waste.

00:12:18.645 --> 00:12:20.874
Everything is metabolized.

00:12:21.244 --> 00:12:24.783
It's not a linear economy
at all, but circular.

00:12:25.934 --> 00:12:28.931
And I felt like the child in the garden.

00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:33.598
For the first time on this new journey,
I could see exactly where we were headed.

00:12:33.598 --> 00:12:37.382
If we could build an economy that would
use things rather than use them up,

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:40.610
we could build a future that really
could work in the long term.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.514
I was excited.

00:12:42.514 --> 00:12:44.673
This was something to work towards.

00:12:44.673 --> 00:12:48.450
We knew exactly where we were headed.
We just had to work out how to get there,

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.380
and it was exactly with this in mind

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.095
that we created the Ellen MacArthur
Foundation in September 2010.

00:12:55.485 --> 00:12:59.348
Many schools of thought fed our thinking
and pointed to this model:

00:12:59.348 --> 00:13:03.968
industrial symbiosis, performance economy,
sharing economy, biomimicry,

00:13:03.968 --> 00:13:06.724
and of course, cradle-to-cradle design.

00:13:06.894 --> 00:13:10.579
Materials would be defined
as either technical or biological,

00:13:10.579 --> 00:13:13.600
waste would be designed out entirely,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.112
and we would have a system
that could function

00:13:16.112 --> 00:13:18.294
absolutely in the long term.

00:13:18.294 --> 00:13:20.361
So what could this economy look like?

00:13:21.151 --> 00:13:25.089
Maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings,
but we'd pay for the service of light,

00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:27.532
and the manufacturers
would recover the materials

00:13:27.532 --> 00:13:30.693
and change the light fittings
when we had more efficient products.

00:13:30.693 --> 00:13:33.990
What if packaging was so nontoxic
it could dissolve in water

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.102
and we could ultimately drink it?
It would never become waste.

00:13:37.102 --> 00:13:39.215
What if engines were re-manufacturable,

00:13:39.215 --> 00:13:41.490
and we could recover
the component materials

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.720
and significantly reduce energy demand.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.160
What if we could recover components
from circuit boards, reutilize them,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.823
and then fundamentally recover
the materials within them

00:13:49.823 --> 00:13:51.225
through a second stage?

00:13:51.225 --> 00:13:53.517
What if we could collect
food waste, human waste?

00:13:53.517 --> 00:13:56.698
What if we could turn that
into fertilizer, heat, energy,

00:13:56.698 --> 00:13:59.694
ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems

00:13:59.694 --> 00:14:02.805
and rebuilding natural capital?

00:14:02.805 --> 00:14:05.707
And cars -- what we want
is to move around.

00:14:05.707 --> 00:14:08.350
We don't need to own
the materials within them.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:09.989
Could cars become a service

00:14:09.989 --> 00:14:12.543
and provide us with
mobility in the future?

00:14:13.033 --> 00:14:17.230
All of this sounds amazing, but these
aren't just ideas, they're real today,

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.950
and these lie at the forefront
of the circular economy.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.454
What lies before us is to expand them
and scale them up.

00:14:24.454 --> 00:14:27.429
So how would you shift
from linear to circular?

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:31.195
Well, the team and I at the foundation
thought you might want to work

00:14:31.195 --> 00:14:33.069
with the top universities in the world,

00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:35.089
with leading businesses within the world,

00:14:35.089 --> 00:14:37.437
with the biggest convening
platforms in the world,

00:14:37.437 --> 00:14:38.439
and with governments.

00:14:38.439 --> 00:14:41.059
We thought you might want
to work with the best analysts

00:14:41.059 --> 00:14:42.313
and ask them the question,

00:14:42.313 --> 00:14:45.514
"Can the circular economy decouple
growth from resource constraints?

00:14:45.514 --> 00:14:49.136
Is the circular economy able
to rebuild natural capital?

00:14:49.136 --> 00:14:52.781
Could the circular economy
replace current chemical fertilizer use?"

00:14:52.781 --> 00:14:55.127
Yes was the answer to the decoupling,

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:58.145
but also yes, we could replace
current fertilizer use

00:14:58.145 --> 00:15:01.930
by a staggering 2.7 times.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.250
But what inspired me most
about the circular economy

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.239
was its ability to inspire young people.

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:11.914
When young people see the economy
through a circular lens,

00:15:11.914 --> 00:15:16.450
they see brand new opportunities
on exactly the same horizon.

00:15:16.488 --> 00:15:19.093
They can use their creativity
and knowledge

00:15:19.093 --> 00:15:21.480
to rebuild the entire system,

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.593
and it's there for the taking right now,

00:15:23.593 --> 00:15:26.049
and the faster we do this, the better.

00:15:26.049 --> 00:15:29.119
So could we achieve this
in their lifetimes?

00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:31.255
Is it actually possible?

00:15:31.255 --> 00:15:32.765
I believe yes.

00:15:33.105 --> 00:15:36.944
When you look at the lifetime of
my great-grandfather, anything's possible.

00:15:37.574 --> 00:15:41.310
When he was born, there were only
25 cars in the world;

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.740
they had only just been invented.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.671
When he was 14, we flew
for the first time in history.

00:15:47.671 --> 00:15:50.160
Now there are 100,000 charter flights

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.106
every single day.

00:15:52.106 --> 00:15:56.100
When he was 45, we built
the first computer.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.257
Many said it wouldn't catch on,
but it did, and just 20 years later

00:15:59.257 --> 00:16:01.278
we turned it into a microchip

00:16:01.278 --> 00:16:05.480
of which there will be thousands
in this room here today.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.359
Ten years before he died,
we built the first mobile phone.

00:16:08.359 --> 00:16:10.333
It wasn't that mobile, to be fair,

00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:12.307
but now it really is,

00:16:12.307 --> 00:16:16.277
and as my great-grandfather
left this Earth, the Internet arrived.

00:16:16.277 --> 00:16:18.390
Now we can do anything,

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.670
but more importantly,

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.985
now we have a plan.

00:16:21.985 --> 00:16:23.990
Thank you.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:33.281
(Applause)
