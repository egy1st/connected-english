00:00:00.481 --> 00:00:02.015
As a matter of fact,

00:00:02.015 --> 00:00:05.287
I was trying to think about my career
since I left the White House,

00:00:05.287 --> 00:00:09.583
and the best example I have is a cartoon
in The New Yorker a couple of years ago.

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:11.742
This little boy is looking up
at his father,

00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:15.787
and he says, "Daddy, when I grow up,
I want to be a former president."

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:17.477
(Laughter)

00:00:17.477 --> 00:00:21.193
Well, I have had a great blessing
as a former president,

00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:23.620
because I have had an access

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.277
that very few other people
in the world have ever had

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:29.923
to get to know so many people
around this whole universe.

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:33.545
Not only am I familiar
with the 50 states in the United States,

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:38.421
but also my wife and I have visited
more than 145 countries in the world,

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:42.670
and the Carter Center has had full-time
programs in 80 nations on Earth.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.866
And a lot of times,
when we go into a country,

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.076
we not only the meet
the king or the president,

00:00:47.076 --> 00:00:51.424
but we also meet the villagers who live
in the most remote areas of Africa.

00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:54.930
So our overall commitment
at the Carter Center

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.927
is to promote human rights,

00:00:56.927 --> 00:01:01.639
and knowing the world as I do,
I can tell you without any equivocation

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.530
that the number one abuse
of human rights on Earth

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.369
is, strangely, not addressed quite often,
is the abuse of women and girls.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.657
(Applause)

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:19.890
There are a couple of reasons for this
that I'll mention to begin with.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.360
First of all is the misinterpretation
of religious scriptures, holy scriptures,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.983
in the Bible, Old Testament,
New Testament, Quran and so forth,

00:01:28.983 --> 00:01:36.246
and these have been misinterpreted by men
who are now in the ascendant positions

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:38.875
in the synagogues and the churches
and in the mosques.

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:42.706
And they interpret these rules
to make sure that women

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:46.960
are ordinarily relegated
to a secondary position

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.848
compared to men in the eyes of God.

00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:54.780
This is a very serious problem.
It's ordinarily not addressed.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.891
A number of years ago, in the year 2000,

00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:00.454
I had been a Baptist,
a Southern Baptist for 70 years --

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:02.936
I tell you, I still teach
Sunday school every Sunday;

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.807
I'll be teaching this Sunday as well --

00:02:04.807 --> 00:02:09.222
but the Southern Baptist Convention
in the year 2000 decided

00:02:09.222 --> 00:02:11.823
that women should play
a secondary position,

00:02:11.823 --> 00:02:13.889
a subservient position to men.

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.606
So they issued an edict, in effect,

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:22.510
that prevents women from being priests,
pastors, deacons in the church,

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.802
or chaplains in the military,

00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:27.960
and if a woman teaches a classroom

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.142
in a Southern Baptist seminary,

00:02:30.142 --> 00:02:33.555
they cannot teach if a boy is in the room,

00:02:33.555 --> 00:02:35.576
because you can find verses in the Bible,

00:02:35.576 --> 00:02:38.600
there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.410
that say that a woman shouldn't
teach a man, and so forth.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.445
But the basic thing is the scriptures
are misinterpreted

00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:46.906
to keep men in an ascendant position.

00:02:46.906 --> 00:02:48.996
That is an all-pervasive problem,

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:53.872
because men can exert that power

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:59.886
and if an abusive husband or an employer,
for instance, wants to cheat women,

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:03.670
they can say that if women
are not equal in the eyes of God,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.862
why should I treat them as equals myself?

00:03:05.862 --> 00:03:10.320
Why should I pay them equal pay
for doing the same kind of work?

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.247
The other very serious blight

00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:16.264
that causes this problem
is the excessive resort to violence,

00:03:16.264 --> 00:03:20.858
and that is increasing
tremendously around the world.

00:03:20.858 --> 00:03:23.787
In the United States of America,
for instance, we have had

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:27.967
an enormous increase
in abuse of poor people,

00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:33.261
mostly black people and minorities,
by putting them in prison.

00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:35.815
When I was in office
as governor of Georgia,

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:39.181
one out of every 1,000 Americans
were in prison.

00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:44.290
Nowadays, 7.3 people
per 1,000 are in prison.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.310
That's a sevenfold increase.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.958
And since I left the White House,

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.279
there's been an 800 percent increase
in the number of women

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:53.856
who are black who are in prison.

00:03:53.856 --> 00:03:56.380
We also have
[one of the only countries] on Earth

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.334
that still has the death penalty
that is a developed country.

00:04:00.334 --> 00:04:03.701
And we rank right alongside
the countries that are most abusive

00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:07.205
in all elements of human rights
in encouraging the death penalty.

00:04:07.555 --> 00:04:10.411
We're in California now,
and I figured out the other day

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:13.406
that California has spent
four billion dollars

00:04:13.406 --> 00:04:17.818
in convicting 13 people
for the death penalty.

00:04:17.818 --> 00:04:22.653
If you add that up, that's 307 million
dollars it costs California

00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:25.601
to send a person to be executed.

00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:29.474
Nebraska this week just passed a law
abolishing the death penalty,

00:04:29.474 --> 00:04:33.940
because it costs so much. (Applause)

00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:39.087
So the resort to violence and abuse
of poor people and helpless people

00:04:39.087 --> 00:04:43.185
is another cause of the increase
in abuse of women.

00:04:43.475 --> 00:04:47.979
Let me just go down a very few
abuses of women that concern me most,

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.880
and I'll be fairly brief, because I have
a limited amount of time, as you know.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.130
One is genital mutilation.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.474
Genital mutilation is horrible
and not known by American women,

00:05:00.474 --> 00:05:04.219
but in some countries, many countries,

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:08.525
when a child is born that's a girl,
very soon in her life,

00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:15.235
her genitals are completely cut away
by a so-called cutter

00:05:15.235 --> 00:05:19.227
who has a razor blade and,
in a non-sterilized way,

00:05:19.227 --> 00:05:23.170
they remove the exterior parts
of a woman's genitalia.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.591
And sometimes, in more extreme cases
but not very rare cases,

00:05:27.591 --> 00:05:31.405
they sew the orifice up so the girl
can just urinate or menstruate.

00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:34.784
And then later, when she gets married,
the same cutter goes in

00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:37.400
and opens the orifice up
so she can have sex.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.415
This is not a rare thing, although
it's against the law in most countries.

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:43.347
In Egypt, for instance,

00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:47.000
91 percent of all the females
that live in Egypt today

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.560
have been sexually mutilated in that way.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.950
In some countries,
it's more than 98 percent

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.246
of the women are cut that way
before they reach maturity.

00:05:57.246 --> 00:05:59.846
This is a horrible affliction

00:05:59.846 --> 00:06:03.515
on all women that live in those countries.

00:06:03.515 --> 00:06:07.299
Another very serious thing
is honor killings,

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:10.625
where a family with misinterpretation,
again, of a holy scripture --

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:13.313
there's nothing in the Quran
that mandates this --

00:06:13.313 --> 00:06:17.500
will execute a girl in their family

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.377
if she is raped

00:06:19.377 --> 00:06:23.112
or if she marries a man
that her father does not approve,

00:06:23.112 --> 00:06:26.223
or sometimes even if she
wears inappropriate clothing.

00:06:26.223 --> 00:06:29.251
And this is done by members
of her own family,

00:06:29.251 --> 00:06:31.456
so the family becomes murderers

00:06:31.456 --> 00:06:35.808
when the girl brings
so-called disgrace to the family.

00:06:35.808 --> 00:06:39.155
An analysis was done in Egypt
not so long ago by the United Nations

00:06:39.155 --> 00:06:43.197
and it showed that 75 percent
of these murders of a girl

00:06:43.197 --> 00:06:48.580
are perpetrated by the father,
the uncle or the brother,

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.032
but 25 percent of the murders
are conducted by women.

00:06:52.032 --> 00:06:53.994
Another problem that we have in the world

00:06:53.994 --> 00:06:56.732
that relates to women
particularly is slavery,

00:06:56.732 --> 00:06:59.147
or human trafficking it's called nowadays.

00:06:59.147 --> 00:07:03.565
There were about 12.5 million people
sold from Africa into slavery

00:07:03.565 --> 00:07:07.784
in the New World back in
the 19th century and the 18th century.

00:07:07.784 --> 00:07:11.639
There are 30 million people
now living in slavery.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:17.281
The United States Department of State
now has a mandate from Congress

00:07:17.281 --> 00:07:19.603
to give a report every year,

00:07:19.603 --> 00:07:24.246
and the State Department reports
that 800,000 people are sold

00:07:24.246 --> 00:07:27.893
across international borders
every year into slavery,

00:07:27.893 --> 00:07:30.841
and that 80 percent
of those sold are women,

00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:32.977
into sexual slavery.

00:07:32.977 --> 00:07:35.531
In the United States right this moment,

00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:39.385
60,000 people are living
in human bondage, or slavery.

00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:42.171
Atlanta, Georgia, where
the Carter Center is located

00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.772
and where I teach at Emory University,

00:07:44.772 --> 00:07:50.079
they have between 200 and 300 women,
people sold into slavery every month.

00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:53.781
It's the number one place
in the nation because of that.

00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:55.987
Atlanta has the busiest
airport in the world,

00:07:55.987 --> 00:08:01.234
and they also have a lot of passengers
that come from the Southern Hemisphere.

00:08:01.234 --> 00:08:03.858
If a brothel owner

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.877
wants to buy a girl
that has brown or black skin,

00:08:06.877 --> 00:08:09.523
they can do it for 1,000 dollars.

00:08:09.523 --> 00:08:13.610
A white-skinned girl brings
several times more than that,

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.000
and the average brothel owner in Atlanta
and in the United States now

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.504
can earn about $35,000 per slave.

00:08:21.504 --> 00:08:26.613
The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds
the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:08:26.613 --> 00:08:31.458
So this is another very serious problem,
and the basic problem is prostitution,

00:08:31.465 --> 00:08:35.459
because there's not
a whorehouse in America

00:08:35.459 --> 00:08:37.688
that's not known by the local officials,

00:08:37.688 --> 00:08:41.659
the local policemen, or the chief
of police or the mayor and so forth.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.386
And this leads to one
of the worst problems,

00:08:44.386 --> 00:08:48.635
and that is that women are bought
increasingly and put into sexual slavery

00:08:48.635 --> 00:08:50.586
in all countries in the world.

00:08:50.586 --> 00:08:53.140
Sweden has got a good approach to it.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.762
About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden
decided to change the law,

00:08:56.762 --> 00:08:59.316
and women are no longer prosecuted

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:02.100
if they are in sexual slavery,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.675
but the brothel owners and the pimps
and the male customers are prosecuted,

00:09:07.675 --> 00:09:12.463
and -- (Applause) --
prostitution has gone down.

00:09:12.463 --> 00:09:15.477
In the United States, we take
just the opposite position.

00:09:15.477 --> 00:09:21.664
For every male arrested
for illegal sex trade,

00:09:21.664 --> 00:09:27.120
25 women are arrested
in the United States of America.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.230
Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden,

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.150
France, and other countries are moving now
towards this so-called Swedish model.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.309
That's another thing that can be done.

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:40.680
We have two great institutions
in this country that all of us admire:

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.511
our military and our great
university system.

00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:48.830
In the military, they are now analyzing
how many sexual assaults take place.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.219
The last report I got,
there were 26,000 sexual assaults

00:09:53.219 --> 00:09:55.564
that took place in the military --

00:09:55.564 --> 00:09:57.200
26,000.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:02.420
Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent,
are actually prosecuted,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.590
and the reason is that the commanding
officer of any organization --

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.842
a ship like my submarine,
or a battalion in the Army

00:10:10.842 --> 00:10:12.978
or a company in the Marines --

00:10:12.978 --> 00:10:17.103
the commanding officer
has the right under law to decide

00:10:17.103 --> 00:10:19.688
whether to prosecute a rapist or not,

00:10:19.688 --> 00:10:22.869
and of course, the last thing they want
is for anybody to know

00:10:22.869 --> 00:10:26.306
that under their command,
sexual assaults are taking place,

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:28.210
so they do not do it.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.752
That law needs to be changed.

00:10:31.472 --> 00:10:34.664
About one out of four girls
who enter American universities

00:10:34.664 --> 00:10:37.451
will be sexually assaulted
before she graduates,

00:10:37.451 --> 00:10:39.737
and this is now getting
a lot of publicity,

00:10:39.737 --> 00:10:41.943
partially because of my book,
but other things,

00:10:41.943 --> 00:10:46.131
and so 89 universities in America
are now condemned

00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:48.816
by the Department of Education
under Title IX

00:10:48.816 --> 00:10:53.529
because the officials of the universities
are not taking care of the women

00:10:53.529 --> 00:10:55.480
to protect them from sexual assault.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.148
The Department of Justice says
that more than half of the rapes

00:10:59.148 --> 00:11:02.631
on a college campus
take place by serial rapists,

00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:05.209
because outside of the university system,

00:11:05.209 --> 00:11:08.227
if they rape somebody,
they'll be prosecuted,

00:11:08.227 --> 00:11:12.255
but when they get on a university campus,
they can rape with impunity.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.298
They're not prosecuted.

00:11:14.298 --> 00:11:17.642
Those are the kinds of things
that go on in our society.

00:11:17.642 --> 00:11:23.214
Another thing that's very serious
about the abuse of women and girls

00:11:23.214 --> 00:11:28.207
is the lack of equal pay for equal work,

00:11:28.207 --> 00:11:30.296
as you know. (Applause)

00:11:30.296 --> 00:11:37.133
And this is sometimes misinterpreted,
but for full-time employment,

00:11:37.133 --> 00:11:40.480
a woman in the United States now
gets 23 percent less than a man.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.369
When I became president,
the difference was 39 percent.

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:47.246
So we've made some progress,
partially because I was president

00:11:47.246 --> 00:11:53.160
and so forth -- (Applause) (Laughter) --

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.568
but in the last 15 years,
there's been no progress made,

00:11:56.568 --> 00:11:59.424
so it's been just about 23
or 24 percent difference

00:11:59.424 --> 00:12:01.699
for the last 15 years.

00:12:01.699 --> 00:12:03.627
These are the kind of things that go on.

00:12:03.627 --> 00:12:06.710
If you take the Fortune 500 companies,

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.849
23 of them have women CEOs,

00:12:09.849 --> 00:12:11.660
out of 500,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.795
and those CEOs, I need not tell you,

00:12:14.795 --> 00:12:16.792
make less on an average

00:12:16.792 --> 00:12:19.910
than the other CEOs.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.388
Well, that's what goes on in our country.

00:12:22.388 --> 00:12:24.872
Another problem with the United States

00:12:24.872 --> 00:12:28.564
is we are the most warlike
nation on Earth.

00:12:28.564 --> 00:12:32.790
We have been to war
with about 25 different countries

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.251
since the Second World War.

00:12:35.251 --> 00:12:37.782
Sometimes, we've had soldiers
on the ground fighting.

00:12:37.782 --> 00:12:39.802
The other times,
we've been flying overhead

00:12:39.802 --> 00:12:41.775
dropping bombs on people.

00:12:41.775 --> 00:12:45.537
Other times, of course, now, we have
drones that attack people and so forth.

00:12:45.537 --> 00:12:48.210
We've been at war
with 25 different countries

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.993
or more since the Second World War.

00:12:50.993 --> 00:12:53.370
There was four years,
I won't say which ones,

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.964
where we didn't --

00:12:54.964 --> 00:13:00.722
(Applause) -- we didn't drop a bomb,
we didn't launch a missile,

00:13:00.722 --> 00:13:02.464
we didn't fire a bullet.

00:13:02.464 --> 00:13:06.860
But anyway, those kinds of things,
the resort to violence

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.476
and the misinterpretation
of the holy scriptures

00:13:09.476 --> 00:13:14.770
are what causes, are the basic causes,
of abuse of women and girls.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.369
There's one more basic cause
that I need not mention,

00:13:18.369 --> 00:13:23.710
and that is that in general,
men don't give a damn.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.751
(Applause)
That's true.

00:13:26.751 --> 00:13:31.777
The average man that might say,
I'm against the abuse of women and girls

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:36.130
quietly accepts the privileged
position that we occupy,

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.570
and this is very similar
to what I knew when I was a child,

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.797
when separate but equal had existed.

00:13:41.797 --> 00:13:47.440
Racial discrimination, legally,
had existed for 100 years,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.573
from 1865 at the end of the War
Between the States, the Civil War,

00:13:50.573 --> 00:13:53.417
all the way up to the 1960s,

00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:56.134
when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed

00:13:56.134 --> 00:13:58.107
for equal rights.

00:13:58.107 --> 00:14:00.847
But during that time,
there were many white people

00:14:00.847 --> 00:14:04.214
that didn't think that
racial discrimination was okay,

00:14:04.214 --> 00:14:06.373
but they stayed quiet,

00:14:06.373 --> 00:14:11.507
because they enjoyed the privileges
of better jobs,

00:14:11.507 --> 00:14:14.918
unique access to jury duty,

00:14:14.918 --> 00:14:17.169
better schools, and everything else,

00:14:17.169 --> 00:14:19.330
and that's the same thing
that exists today,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.975
because the average man
really doesn't care.

00:14:22.975 --> 00:14:29.320
Even though they say, "I'm against
discrimination against girls and women,"

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.770
they enjoy a privileged position.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.142
And it's very difficult to get
the majority of men

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:38.188
who control the university system,

00:14:38.188 --> 00:14:40.852
the majority of men that control
the military system,

00:14:40.852 --> 00:14:44.350
the majority of men that control
the governments of the world,

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:49.584
and the majority of men that control
the great religions.

00:14:49.584 --> 00:14:52.997
So what is the basic thing
that we need to do today?

00:14:52.997 --> 00:14:55.528
I would say the best thing
that we could do today

00:14:55.528 --> 00:14:59.840
is for the women in the powerful nations

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.563
like this one, and where you come from,

00:15:02.563 --> 00:15:07.532
Europe and so forth, who have influence
and who have freedom to speak and to act,

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:12.558
need to take the responsibility
on yourselves

00:15:12.558 --> 00:15:15.623
to be more forceful in demanding

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:20.265
an end to racial discrimination
against girls and women

00:15:20.265 --> 00:15:21.626
all over the world.

00:15:21.626 --> 00:15:24.527
The average woman in Egypt

00:15:24.527 --> 00:15:26.693
doesn't have much to say
about her daughters

00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:30.101
getting genitally mutilated and so forth.

00:15:30.101 --> 00:15:32.175
I didn't even go down
to detail about that.

00:15:32.175 --> 00:15:34.234
But I hope that out of this conference,

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:38.748
that every woman here 
will get your husbands to realize

00:15:38.748 --> 00:15:42.870
that these abuses on the college campuses
and the military and so forth

00:15:42.872 --> 00:15:45.411
and in the future job market,

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:49.860
need to protect your daughters
and your granddaughters.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:55.622
I have 12 grandchildren,
four children, and 10 great-grandchildren,

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:57.546
and I think often about them

00:15:57.546 --> 00:16:00.611
and about the plight that they
will face in America,

00:16:00.611 --> 00:16:04.396
not only if they lived in Egypt
or a foreign country,

00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:06.602
in having equal rights,

00:16:06.602 --> 00:16:08.935
and I hope that all of you will join me

00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:12.662
in being a champion for women
and girls around the world


00:16:12.662 --> 00:16:14.217
and protect their human rights.

00:16:14.217 --> 00:16:17.189
Thank you very much.

00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:21.189
(Applause)
