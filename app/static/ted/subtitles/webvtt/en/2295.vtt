WEBVTT

00:00:01.014 --> 00:00:02.825
I'll begin today

00:00:02.825 --> 00:00:04.891
by sharing a poem

00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:08.026
written by my friend from Malawi,

00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:10.162
Eileen Piri.

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:13.506
Eileen is only 13 years old,

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:19.380
but when we were going through
the collection of poetry that we wrote,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.248
I found her poem so interesting,

00:00:22.248 --> 00:00:24.245
so motivating.

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:26.358
So I'll read it to you.

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:30.503
She entitled her poem
"I'll Marry When I Want."

00:00:30.503 --> 00:00:33.359
(Laughter)

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:35.890
"I'll marry when I want.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.790
My mother can't force me to marry.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.994
My father cannot force me to marry.

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:48.336
My uncle, my aunt,

00:00:48.336 --> 00:00:50.681
my brother or sister,

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:52.863
cannot force me to marry.

00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:56.254
No one in the world

00:00:56.254 --> 00:00:59.550
can force me to marry.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.499
I'll marry when I want.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.077
Even if you beat me,

00:01:05.077 --> 00:01:07.747
even if you chase me away,

00:01:07.747 --> 00:01:10.928
even if you do anything bad to me,

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:14.364
I'll marry when I want.

00:01:14.364 --> 00:01:17.267
I'll marry when I want,

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:21.005
but not before I am well educated,

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:25.323
and not before I am all grown up.

00:01:25.323 --> 00:01:27.810
I'll marry when I want."

00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:31.827
This poem might seem odd,

00:01:31.827 --> 00:01:35.356
written by a 13-year-old girl,

00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:40.139
but where I and Eileen come from,

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:43.900
this poem, which I have just read to you,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.616
is a warrior's cry.

00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:50.541
I am from Malawi.

00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:55.115
Malawi is one of the poorest countries,

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.994
very poor,

00:01:57.994 --> 00:02:02.522
where gender equality is questionable.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.844
Growing up in that country,

00:02:04.844 --> 00:02:08.095
I couldn't make my own choices in life.

00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:10.393
I couldn't even explore

00:02:10.393 --> 00:02:13.389
personal opportunities in life.

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.919
I will tell you a story

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.381
of two different girls,

00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:22.026
two beautiful girls.

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:24.580
These girls grew up

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.693
under the same roof.

00:02:26.693 --> 00:02:29.410
They were eating the same food.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.173
Sometimes, they would share clothes,

00:02:32.173 --> 00:02:34.982
and even shoes.

00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:39.649
But their lives ended up differently,

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:41.646
in two different paths.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.754
The other girl is my little sister.

00:02:46.754 --> 00:02:51.677
My little sister was only 11 years old

00:02:51.677 --> 00:02:54.329
when she got pregnant.

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.742
It's a hurtful thing.

00:03:01.352 --> 00:03:04.633
Not only did it hurt her, even me.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:08.232
I was going through a hard time as well.

00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:11.947
As it is in my culture,

00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:14.942
once you reach puberty stage,

00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:18.820
you are supposed to go
to initiation camps.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.118
In these initiation camps,

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:24.973
you are taught how
to sexually please a man.

00:03:24.973 --> 00:03:26.761
There is this special day,

00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:29.965
which they call "Very Special Day"

00:03:29.965 --> 00:03:32.519
where a man who is hired
by the community

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.143
comes to the camp

00:03:35.143 --> 00:03:37.572
and sleeps with the little girls.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.766
Imagine the trauma that these young girls


00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:44.516
go through every day.

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:49.925
Most girls end up pregnant.

00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:52.542
They even contract HIV and AIDS


00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:54.882
and other sexually transmitted diseases.

00:03:55.692 --> 00:04:00.603
For my little sister,
she ended up being pregnant.

00:04:00.603 --> 00:04:04.666
Today, she's only 16 years old

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:07.662
and she has three children.

00:04:07.662 --> 00:04:11.307
Her first marriage did not survive,

00:04:11.307 --> 00:04:14.604
nor did her second marriage.

00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:18.781
On the other side, there is this girl.

00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:21.314
She's amazing.

00:04:21.314 --> 00:04:23.218
(Laughter)

00:04:23.218 --> 00:04:26.163
(Applause)

00:04:27.723 --> 00:04:30.138
I call her amazing because she is.

00:04:30.138 --> 00:04:33.203
She's very fabulous.

00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:36.964
That girl is me. (Laughter)

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:39.982
When I was 13 years old,

00:04:39.982 --> 00:04:43.396
I was told, you are grown up,

00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:46.228
you have now reached of age,

00:04:46.228 --> 00:04:49.595
you're supposed to go
to the initiation camp.

00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:52.567
I was like, "What?

00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:56.549
I'm not going to go
to the initiation camps."

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.112
You know what the women said to me?

00:05:01.112 --> 00:05:04.734
"You are a stupid girl. Stubborn.

00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:12.001
You do not respect the traditions
of our society, of our community."

00:05:12.001 --> 00:05:15.809
I said no because I knew
where I was going.

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:18.433
I knew what I wanted in life.

00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:22.738
I had a lot of dreams as a young girl.

00:05:24.238 --> 00:05:27.883
I wanted to get well educated,

00:05:27.883 --> 00:05:30.363
to find a decent job in the future.

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:32.122
I was imagining myself as a lawyer,


00:05:32.122 --> 00:05:34.832
seated on that big chair.

00:05:34.832 --> 00:05:37.138
Those were the imaginations that


00:05:37.138 --> 00:05:40.468
were going through my mind every day.

00:05:40.468 --> 00:05:42.302
And I knew that one day,

00:05:42.302 --> 00:05:46.876
I would contribute something,
a little something to my community.

00:05:46.876 --> 00:05:49.407
But every day after refusing,

00:05:49.407 --> 00:05:51.427
women would tell me,

00:05:51.427 --> 00:05:54.817
"Look at you, you're all grown up.
Your little sister has a baby.

00:05:54.817 --> 00:05:56.303
What about you?"

00:05:56.303 --> 00:06:01.017
That was the music
that I was hearing every day,

00:06:01.017 --> 00:06:04.894
and that is the music
that girls hear every day

00:06:04.894 --> 00:06:09.043
when they don't do something
that the community needs them to do.

00:06:11.524 --> 00:06:15.448
When I compared the two stories
between me and my sister,

00:06:15.448 --> 00:06:20.185
I said, "Why can't I do something?

00:06:20.185 --> 00:06:25.246
Why can't I change something
that has happened for a long time

00:06:25.246 --> 00:06:27.661
in our community?"

00:06:27.661 --> 00:06:30.169
That was when I called other girls

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.723
just like my sister, who have children,

00:06:32.723 --> 00:06:36.187
who have been in class but they have
forgotten how to read and write.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:38.297
I said, "Come on, we can 
remind each other

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:40.432
how to read and write again,

00:06:40.432 --> 00:06:44.240
how to hold the pen,
how to read, to hold the book."

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.885
It was a great time I had with them.

00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:52.157
Nor did I just learn a little about them,

00:06:52.157 --> 00:06:55.594
but they were able to tell me
their personal stories,

00:06:55.594 --> 00:06:57.405
what they were facing every day

00:06:57.405 --> 00:07:00.075
as young mothers.

00:07:00.075 --> 00:07:02.072
That was when I was like,

00:07:02.072 --> 00:07:05.996
'Why can't we take all these things
that are happening to us

00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:09.873
and present them and tell our mothers,
our traditional leaders,

00:07:09.873 --> 00:07:11.870
that these are the wrong things?"

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.937
It was a scary thing to do,

00:07:13.937 --> 00:07:15.910
because these traditional leaders,

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.114
they are already accustomed to the things


00:07:18.114 --> 00:07:20.554
that have been there for ages.

00:07:20.554 --> 00:07:22.481
A hard thing to change,

00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:25.105
but a good thing to try.

00:07:25.105 --> 00:07:27.357
So we tried.

00:07:27.357 --> 00:07:29.865
It was very hard, but we pushed.

00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:33.109
And I'm here to say that in my community,


00:07:33.109 --> 00:07:35.669
it was the first community after girls


00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:39.036
pushed so hard to our traditional leader,


00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:43.425
and our leader stood up for us
and said no girl has to be married

00:07:43.425 --> 00:07:45.654
before the age of 18.

00:07:45.654 --> 00:07:49.507
(Applause)

00:07:53.502 --> 00:07:55.243
In my community,

00:07:55.243 --> 00:07:57.890
that was the first time a community,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.351
they had to call the bylaws,

00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:03.858
the first bylaw that protected girls

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.052
in our community.

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:07.840
We did not stop there.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.789
We forged ahead.

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:14.643
We were determined to fight for girls
not just in my community,

00:08:14.643 --> 00:08:17.429
but even in other communities.

00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:21.562
When the child marriage bill
was being presented in February,

00:08:21.562 --> 00:08:25.208
we were there at the Parliament house.

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:29.294
Every day, when the members
of Parliament were entering,

00:08:29.294 --> 00:08:32.383
we were telling them,
"Would you please support the bill?"

00:08:32.383 --> 00:08:37.142
And we don't have
much technology like here,

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:39.139
but we have our small phones.

00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:44.169
So we said, "Why can't we get 
their numbers and text them?"

00:08:44.178 --> 00:08:47.428
So we did that. It was a good thing.

00:08:47.428 --> 00:08:49.448
(Applause)

00:08:49.448 --> 00:08:52.421
So when the bill passed,
we texted them back,

00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:54.849
"Thank you for supporting the bill."

00:08:54.849 --> 00:08:55.919
(Laughter)

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:59.264
And when the bill was signed
by the president,

00:08:59.264 --> 00:09:02.630
making it into law, it was a plus.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:08.482
Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal
marriage age, from 15 to 18.

00:09:08.482 --> 00:09:12.127
(Applause)

00:09:14.495 --> 00:09:18.071
It's a good thing to know
that the bill passed,

00:09:18.071 --> 00:09:21.113
but let me tell you this:

00:09:21.113 --> 00:09:25.501
There are countries where 18
is the legal marriage age,

00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:29.773
but don't we hear cries
of women and girls every day?

00:09:29.773 --> 00:09:35.416
Every day, girls' lives
are being wasted away.

00:09:35.416 --> 00:09:41.870
This is high time for leaders
to honor their commitment.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.239
In honoring this commitment,

00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:49.951
it means keeping girls' issues
at heart every time.

00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:53.712
We don't have to be subjected as second,

00:09:53.712 --> 00:09:57.950
but they have to know that women,
as we are in this room,

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.000
we are not just women,
we are not just girls,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.980
we are extraordinary.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.893
We can do more.

00:10:04.893 --> 00:10:07.888
And another thing for Malawi,

00:10:07.888 --> 00:10:10.790
and not just Malawi but other countries:

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.575
The laws which are there,

00:10:14.575 --> 00:10:20.426
you know how a law is not a law
until it is enforced?

00:10:20.426 --> 00:10:23.839
The law which has just recently passed

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:26.463
and the laws that in other countries
have been there,

00:10:26.463 --> 00:10:30.387
they need to be publicized
at the local level,

00:10:30.387 --> 00:10:32.570
at the community level,

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:37.956
where girls' issues are very striking.

00:10:37.956 --> 00:10:42.716
Girls face issues, difficult issues,
at the community level every day.

00:10:43.274 --> 00:10:48.359
So if these young girls know
that there are laws that protect them,

00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:51.145
they will be able to stand up
and defend themselves

00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:54.816
because they will know that
there is a law that protects them.

00:10:57.254 --> 00:11:01.363
And another thing I would say is that

00:11:01.363 --> 00:11:05.961
girls' voices and women's voices

00:11:05.961 --> 00:11:08.724
are beautiful, they are there,

00:11:08.724 --> 00:11:11.905
but we cannot do this alone.

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:14.575
Male advocates, they have to jump in,

00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:16.525
to step in and work together.

00:11:16.525 --> 00:11:19.103
It's a collective work.

00:11:19.103 --> 00:11:21.843
What we need is what girls elsewhere need:

00:11:21.843 --> 00:11:27.601
good education, and above all,
not to marry whilst 11.

00:11:30.085 --> 00:11:32.953
And furthermore,

00:11:32.953 --> 00:11:36.018
I know that together,

00:11:36.018 --> 00:11:39.966
we can transform the legal,

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:43.135
the cultural and political framework

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:47.906
that denies girls of their rights.

00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:52.964
I am standing here today

00:11:52.964 --> 00:12:00.004
and declaring that we can
end child marriage in a generation.

00:12:00.677 --> 00:12:02.860
This is the moment

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.294
where a girl and a girl,
and millions of girls worldwide,

00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:09.895
will be able to say,

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:13.099
"I will marry when I want."

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:16.144
(Applause)

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.219
Thank you. (Applause)
