00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:02.421
Over the past 10 years,

00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:07.014
I've been researching the way
people organize and visualize information.

00:00:07.786 --> 00:00:09.825
And I've noticed an interesting shift.

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.886
For a long period of time,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.338
we believed in a natural ranking order
in the world around us,

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:21.107
also known as the great chain of being,
or "Scala naturae" in Latin,

00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:25.306
a top-down structure that normally starts
with God at the very top,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.735
followed by angels, noblemen,

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.772
common people, animals, and so on.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.274
This idea was actually based
on Aristotle's ontology,

00:00:36.298 --> 00:00:40.742
which classified all things known to man
in a set of opposing categories,

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.488
like the ones you see behind me.

00:00:44.687 --> 00:00:47.434
But over time, interestingly enough,

00:00:47.458 --> 00:00:51.604
this concept adopted
the branching schema of a tree

00:00:51.628 --> 00:00:54.501
in what became known
as the Porphyrian tree,

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:58.167
also considered to be
the oldest tree of knowledge.

00:00:59.238 --> 00:01:01.412
The branching scheme
of the tree was, in fact,

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:04.385
such a powerful metaphor
for conveying information

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.679
that it became, over time,
an important communication tool

00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:09.977
to map a variety of systems of knowledge.

00:01:10.648 --> 00:01:13.731
We can see trees being used
to map morality,

00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:16.604
with the popular tree of virtues
and tree of vices,

00:01:16.628 --> 00:01:20.420
as you can see here, with these beautiful
illustrations from medieval Europe.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:23.913
We can see trees being used
to map consanguinity,

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:26.181
the various blood ties between people.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.206
We can also see trees being used
to map genealogy,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.040
perhaps the most famous archetype
of the tree diagram.

00:01:33.064 --> 00:01:36.380
I think many of you in the audience
have probably seen family trees.

00:01:36.404 --> 00:01:40.109
Many of you probably even have
your own family trees drawn in such a way.

00:01:41.158 --> 00:01:44.069
We can see trees even mapping
systems of law,

00:01:44.093 --> 00:01:47.944
the various decrees and rulings
of kings and rulers.

00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:53.543
And finally, of course,
also a very popular scientific metaphor,

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:57.127
we can see trees being used
to map all species known to man.

00:01:59.177 --> 00:02:03.083
And trees ultimately became
such a powerful visual metaphor

00:02:03.107 --> 00:02:05.975
because in many ways,
they really embody this human desire

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:09.035
for order, for balance,
for unity, for symmetry.

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:14.322
However, nowadays we are really facing
new complex, intricate challenges

00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:18.536
that cannot be understood by simply
employing a simple tree diagram.

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:23.279
And a new metaphor is currently emerging,

00:02:23.303 --> 00:02:25.453
and it's currently replacing the tree

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:28.040
in visualizing various
systems of knowledge.

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:32.316
It's really providing us with a new lens
to understand the world around us.

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:36.694
And this new metaphor
is the metaphor of the network.

00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:40.822
And we can see this shift
from trees into networks

00:02:40.846 --> 00:02:42.486
in many domains of knowledge.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.699
We can see this shift in the way
we try to understand the brain.

00:02:48.453 --> 00:02:50.491
While before, we used
to think of the brain

00:02:50.515 --> 00:02:52.506
as a modular, centralized organ,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.568
where a given area was responsible
for a set of actions and behaviors,

00:02:56.592 --> 00:02:58.331
the more we know about the brain,

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:01.641
the more we think of it
as a large music symphony,

00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:04.275
played by hundreds
and thousands of instruments.

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.975
This is a beautiful snapshot
created by the Blue Brain Project,

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:12.062
where you can see 10,000 neurons
and 30 million connections.

00:03:12.736 --> 00:03:16.624
And this is only mapping 10 percent
of a mammalian neocortex.

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:22.975
We can also see this shift in the way
we try to conceive of human knowledge.

00:03:24.062 --> 00:03:27.210
These are some remarkable trees
of knowledge, or trees of science,

00:03:27.234 --> 00:03:29.455
by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull.

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:31.809
And Llull was actually the precursor,

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:35.547
the very first one who created
the metaphor of science as a tree,

00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:38.539
a metaphor we use
every single day, when we say,

00:03:38.563 --> 00:03:40.228
"Biology is a branch of science,"

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:41.405
when we say,

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.362
"Genetics is a branch of science."

00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:47.878
But perhaps the most beautiful of all
trees of knowledge, at least for me,

00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:52.354
was created for the French encyclopedia
by Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751.

00:03:52.378 --> 00:03:55.013
This was really the bastion
of the French Enlightenment,

00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:58.862
and this gorgeous illustration
was featured as a table of contents

00:03:58.886 --> 00:04:00.457
for the encyclopedia.

00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:04.668
And it actually maps out
all domains of knowledge

00:04:04.692 --> 00:04:06.810
as separate branches of a tree.

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:10.199
But knowledge is much more
intricate than this.

00:04:10.794 --> 00:04:15.434
These are two maps of Wikipedia
showing the inter-linkage of articles --

00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:19.348
related to history on the left,
and mathematics on the right.

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:21.705
And I think by looking at these maps

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.273
and other ones that have been
created of Wikipedia --

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:27.689
arguably one of the largest rhizomatic
structures ever created by man --

00:04:27.713 --> 00:04:31.535
we can really understand
how human knowledge is much more intricate

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:33.995
and interdependent, just like a network.

00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:37.618
We can also see this interesting shift

00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:40.342
in the way we map
social ties between people.

00:04:41.524 --> 00:04:43.819
This is the typical organization chart.

00:04:43.843 --> 00:04:46.637
I'm assuming many of you have seen
a similar chart as well,

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.407
in your own corporations, or others.

00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:49.916
It's a top-down structure

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.801
that normally starts
with the CEO at the very top,

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:56.785
and where you can drill down all the way
to the individual workmen on the bottom.

00:04:57.634 --> 00:05:02.482
But humans sometimes are, well, actually,
all humans are unique in their own way,

00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:07.204
and sometimes you really don't play well
under this really rigid structure.

00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:11.821
I think the Internet is really changing
this paradigm quite a lot.

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:15.210
This is a fantastic map
of online social collaboration

00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:16.863
between Perl developers.

00:05:16.887 --> 00:05:18.975
Perl is a famous programming language,

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:21.722
and here, you can see
how different programmers

00:05:21.746 --> 00:05:25.573
are actually exchanging files,
and working together on a given project.

00:05:25.597 --> 00:05:29.775
And here, you can notice that this is
a completely decentralized process --

00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:31.955
there's no leader in this organization,

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.136
it's a network.

00:05:34.337 --> 00:05:39.042
We can also see this interesting shift
when we look at terrorism.

00:05:39.613 --> 00:05:42.717
One of the main challenges
of understanding terrorism nowadays

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:46.471
is that we are dealing with
decentralized, independent cells,

00:05:46.495 --> 00:05:49.317
where there's no leader
leading the whole process.

00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:53.816
And here, you can actually see
how visualization is being used.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.497
The diagram that you see behind me

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:59.339
shows all the terrorists involved
in the Madrid attack in 2004.

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.869
And what they did here is,
they actually segmented the network

00:06:02.893 --> 00:06:04.392
into three different years,

00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:07.458
represented by the vertical layers
that you see behind me.

00:06:07.482 --> 00:06:09.451
And the blue lines tie together

00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:13.093
the people that were present
in that network year after year.

00:06:13.117 --> 00:06:15.145
So even though there's no leader per se,

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.804
these people are probably the most
influential ones in that organization,

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:20.836
the ones that know more about the past,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.737
and the future plans and goals
of this particular cell.

00:06:25.232 --> 00:06:28.238
We can also see this shift
from trees into networks

00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:31.253
in the way we classify
and organize species.

00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:36.074
The image on the right
is the only illustration

00:06:36.098 --> 00:06:39.210
that Darwin included
in "The Origin of Species,"

00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:41.495
which Darwin called the "Tree of Life."

00:06:42.098 --> 00:06:44.983
There's actually a letter
from Darwin to the publisher,

00:06:45.007 --> 00:06:47.663
expanding on the importance
of this particular diagram.

00:06:47.687 --> 00:06:50.329
It was critical for Darwin's
theory of evolution.

00:06:51.408 --> 00:06:54.975
But recently, scientists discovered
that overlaying this tree of life

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:57.434
is a dense network of bacteria,

00:06:57.458 --> 00:06:59.619
and these bacteria
are actually tying together

00:06:59.643 --> 00:07:01.815
species that were completely
separated before,

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.919
to what scientists are now calling
not the tree of life,

00:07:04.943 --> 00:07:07.799
but the web of life, the network of life.

00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:12.003
And finally, we can really
see this shift, again,

00:07:12.027 --> 00:07:14.451
when we look at ecosystems
around our planet.

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:18.765
No more do we have these simplified
predator-versus-prey diagrams

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.236
we have all learned at school.

00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:24.190
This is a much more accurate
depiction of an ecosystem.

00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:27.118
This is a diagram created
by Professor David Lavigne,

00:07:27.142 --> 00:07:30.642
mapping close to 100 species
that interact with the codfish

00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:33.617
off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada.

00:07:34.244 --> 00:07:38.181
And I think here, we can really understand
the intricate and interdependent nature

00:07:38.205 --> 00:07:40.728
of most ecosystems
that abound on our planet.

00:07:42.442 --> 00:07:46.086
But even though recent,
this metaphor of the network,

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.213
is really already adopting
various shapes and forms,

00:07:49.237 --> 00:07:51.700
and it's almost becoming
a growing visual taxonomy.

00:07:51.724 --> 00:07:54.371
It's almost becoming
the syntax of a new language.

00:07:54.395 --> 00:07:57.028
And this is one aspect
that truly fascinates me.

00:07:57.678 --> 00:08:00.211
And these are actually
15 different typologies

00:08:00.235 --> 00:08:02.370
I've been collecting over time,

00:08:02.394 --> 00:08:06.416
and it really shows the immense
visual diversity of this new metaphor.

00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:08.223
And here is an example.

00:08:08.818 --> 00:08:12.751
On the very top band,
you have radial convergence,

00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:16.714
a visualization model that has become
really popular over the last five years.

00:08:17.198 --> 00:08:21.552
At the top left, the very first project
is a gene network,

00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:25.585
followed by a network
of IP addresses -- machines, servers --

00:08:25.609 --> 00:08:28.581
followed by a network of Facebook friends.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.748
You probably couldn't find
more disparate topics,

00:08:31.772 --> 00:08:35.566
yet they are using the same metaphor,
the same visual model,

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.196
to map the never-ending complexities
of its own subject.

00:08:40.545 --> 00:08:43.669
And here are a few more examples
of the many I've been collecting,

00:08:43.693 --> 00:08:46.431
of this growing visual
taxonomy of networks.

00:08:48.248 --> 00:08:51.113
But networks are not just
a scientific metaphor.

00:08:52.192 --> 00:08:57.733
As designers, researchers, and scientists
try to map a variety of complex systems,

00:08:57.757 --> 00:09:00.570
they are in many ways influencing
traditional art fields,

00:09:00.594 --> 00:09:01.996
like painting and sculpture,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.013
and influencing many different artists.

00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:08.760
And perhaps because networks have
this huge aesthetical force to them --

00:09:08.784 --> 00:09:10.742
they're immensely gorgeous --

00:09:10.766 --> 00:09:12.822
they are really becoming a cultural meme,

00:09:12.846 --> 00:09:17.171
and driving a new art movement,
which I've called "networkism."

00:09:18.544 --> 00:09:21.752
And we can see this influence
in this movement in a variety of ways.

00:09:21.776 --> 00:09:23.569
This is just one of many examples,

00:09:23.593 --> 00:09:26.318
where you can see this influence
from science into art.

00:09:26.342 --> 00:09:29.213
The example on your left side
is IP-mapping,

00:09:29.237 --> 00:09:32.896
a computer-generated map of IP addresses;
again -- servers, machines.

00:09:33.253 --> 00:09:34.458
And on your right side,

00:09:34.482 --> 00:09:39.100
you have "Transient Structures
and Unstable Networks" by Sharon Molloy,

00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:41.218
using oil and enamel on canvas.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.975
And here are a few more
paintings by Sharon Molloy,

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:46.931
some gorgeous, intricate paintings.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:51.681
And here's another example
of that interesting cross-pollination

00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:53.109
between science and art.

00:09:53.475 --> 00:09:56.140
On your left side,
you have "Operation Smile."

00:09:56.164 --> 00:09:59.053
It is a computer-generated map
of a social network.

00:09:59.077 --> 00:10:02.803
And on your right side,
you have "Field 4," by Emma McNally,

00:10:02.827 --> 00:10:04.913
using only graphite on paper.

00:10:05.374 --> 00:10:08.891
Emma McNally is one of the main
leaders of this movement,

00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:11.484
and she creates these striking,
imaginary landscapes,

00:10:11.508 --> 00:10:16.173
where you can really notice the influence
from traditional network visualization.

00:10:18.324 --> 00:10:21.331
But networkism doesn't happen
only in two dimensions.

00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:23.633
This is perhaps
one of my favorite projects

00:10:23.657 --> 00:10:25.062
of this new movement.

00:10:25.086 --> 00:10:27.720
And I think the title really
says it all -- it's called:

00:10:27.744 --> 00:10:29.911
"Galaxies Forming Along Filaments,

00:10:29.935 --> 00:10:33.267
Like Droplets Along the Strands
of a Spider's Web."

00:10:34.616 --> 00:10:37.696
And I just find this particular project
to be immensely powerful.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.680
It was created by Tomás Saraceno,

00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:42.402
and he occupies these large spaces,

00:10:42.426 --> 00:10:45.768
creates these massive installations
using only elastic ropes.

00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:49.609
As you actually navigate that space
and bounce along those elastic ropes,

00:10:49.633 --> 00:10:54.208
the entire network kind of shifts,
almost like a real organic network would.

00:10:55.414 --> 00:10:57.446
And here's yet another example

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.859
of networkism taken
to a whole different level.

00:11:00.303 --> 00:11:03.516
This was created
by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.295
in a piece called "In Silence."

00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:11.189
And Chiharu, like Tomás Saraceno,
fills these rooms with this dense network,

00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:14.975
this dense web of elastic ropes
and black wool and thread,

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:17.758
sometimes including objects,
as you can see here,

00:11:17.782 --> 00:11:20.804
sometimes even including people,
in many of her installations.

00:11:23.374 --> 00:11:26.065
But networks are also
not just a new trend,

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:28.453
and it's too easy for us
to dismiss it as such.

00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:32.636
Networks really embody
notions of decentralization,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.794
of interconnectedness, of interdependence.

00:11:36.303 --> 00:11:38.779
And this new way of thinking is critical

00:11:38.803 --> 00:11:42.533
for us to solve many of the complex
problems we are facing nowadays,

00:11:42.557 --> 00:11:44.398
from decoding the human brain,

00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:46.825
to understanding
the vast universe out there.

00:11:47.746 --> 00:11:52.235
On your left side, you have a snapshot
of a neural network of a mouse --

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:54.679
very similar to our own
at this particular scale.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.466
And on your right side, you have
the Millennium Simulation.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.238
It was the largest
and most realistic simulation

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.052
of the growth of cosmic structure.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.006
It was able to recreate the history
of 20 million galaxies

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.120
in approximately 25 terabytes of output.

00:12:12.081 --> 00:12:13.494
And coincidentally or not,

00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:15.391
I just find this particular comparison

00:12:15.415 --> 00:12:18.118
between the smallest scale
of knowledge -- the brain --

00:12:18.142 --> 00:12:20.971
and the largest scale of knowledge --
the universe itself --

00:12:20.995 --> 00:12:23.272
to be really quite striking
and fascinating.

00:12:23.807 --> 00:12:26.441
Because as Bruce Mau once said,

00:12:26.465 --> 00:12:28.877
"When everything is connected
to everything else,

00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:31.298
for better or for worse,
everything matters."

00:12:31.322 --> 00:12:32.473
Thank you so much.

00:12:32.497 --> 00:12:36.299
