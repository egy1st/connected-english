00:00:00.598 --> 00:00:03.211
It was the middle of summer
and well past closing time

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.898
in the downtown Berkeley bar
where my friend Polly and I

00:00:05.898 --> 00:00:08.239
worked together as bartenders.

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:12.485
Usually at the end of our shift
we had a drink -- but not that night.

00:00:13.732 --> 00:00:14.737
"I'm pregnant.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:18.266
Not sure what I'm going
to do yet," I told Polly.

00:00:18.729 --> 00:00:21.912
Without hesitation, she replied,
"I've had an abortion."

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:27.624
Before Polly, no one had ever told me
that she'd had an abortion.

00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:31.336
I'd graduated from college
just a few months earlier

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:34.961
and I was in a new relationship
when I found out that I was pregnant.

00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:40.484
When I thought about my choices,
I honestly did not know how to decide,

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:42.809
what criteria I should use.

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:45.758
How would I know what
the right decision was?

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:49.682
I worried that I would regret 
an abortion later.

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:53.726
Coming of age on the beaches
of Southern California,

00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:56.787
I grew up in the middle of 
our nation's abortion wars.

00:00:57.646 --> 00:01:02.290
I was born in a trailer on the third
anniversary of Roe vs. Wade.

00:01:03.578 --> 00:01:06.265
Our community was surfing Christians.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:09.650
We cared about God, the less fortunate,
and the ocean.

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:11.740
Everyone was pro-life.

00:01:12.413 --> 00:01:18.125
As a kid, the idea of abortion made me so
sad that I knew if I ever got pregnant

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:19.522
I could never have one.

00:01:21.412 --> 00:01:22.560
And then I did.

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.809
It was a step towards the unknown.

00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:30.305
But Polly had given me
a very special gift:

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:32.687
the knowledge that I wasn't alone

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:36.747
and the realization that abortion
was something that we can talk about.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:38.883
Abortion is common.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.678
According to the Guttmacher Institute,
one in three women in America

00:01:42.714 --> 00:01:45.152
will have an abortion in their lifetime.

00:01:48.147 --> 00:01:52.050
But for the last few decades, the dialogue
around abortion in the United States

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.461
has left little room for anything beyond 
pro-life and pro-choice.

00:01:55.944 --> 00:01:58.278
It's political and polarizing.

00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:02.962
But as much as abortion is hotly debated,
it's still rare for us,

00:02:02.982 --> 00:02:06.898
whether as fellow women
or even just as fellow people,

00:02:06.898 --> 00:02:10.994
to talk with one another
about the abortions that we have.

00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:13.176
There is a gap.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.215
Between what happens in politics
and what happens in real life,

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:19.469
and in that gap, a battlefield mentality.

00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:22.696
An "are you with us 
or against us?" stance takes root.

00:02:24.058 --> 00:02:26.550
This isn't just about abortion.

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:31.032
There are so many important issues 
that we can't talk about.

00:02:32.278 --> 00:02:37.524
And so finding ways to shift the conflict
to a place of conversation

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.576
is the work of my life.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.127
There are two main ways to get started.

00:02:44.332 --> 00:02:46.472
One way is to listen closely.


00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:49.328
And the other way is to share stories.

00:02:51.073 --> 00:02:54.645
So, 15 years ago, I cofounded
an organization called Exhale

00:02:54.664 --> 00:02:57.315
to start listening to people 
who have had abortions.

00:02:58.593 --> 00:03:01.963
The first thing we did was create 
a talk-line, where women and men

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:04.003
could call to get emotional support.

00:03:04.862 --> 00:03:09.041
Free of judgment and politics,
believe it or not, nothing like our sevice

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:10.457
had ever existed.

00:03:12.257 --> 00:03:16.467
We needed a new framework that could 
hold all the experiences that we were

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:18.375
hearing on our talk-line.

00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:21.115
The feminist who regrets her abortion.

00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:24.017
The Catholic who is grateful for hers.

00:03:24.132 --> 00:03:28.800
The personal experiences that weren't 
fitting neatly into one box or the other.

00:03:29.416 --> 00:03:32.957
We didn't think it was right 
to ask women to pick a side.

00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:38.320
We wanted to show them that
the whole world was on their side,

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.825
as they were going through this deeply
personal experience.

00:03:42.964 --> 00:03:44.775
So we invented "pro-voice."

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:50.719
Beyond abortion, pro-voice works on hard
issues that we've struggled with globally

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:51.973
for years,

00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:57.315
issues like immigration, religious
tolerance, violence against women.

00:03:57.315 --> 00:04:01.307
It also works on deeply personal topics 
that might only matter to you

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.305
and your immediate family and friends.

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.796
They have a terminal illness, 
their mother just died,

00:04:07.878 --> 00:04:11.523
they have a child with special needs
and they can't talk about it.

00:04:13.636 --> 00:04:18.048
Listening and storytelling are
the hallmarks of pro-voice practice.

00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:20.927
Listening and storytelling.

00:04:21.484 --> 00:04:23.156
That sounds pretty nice.

00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:26.848
Sounds maybe, easy?
We could all do that.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.161
It's not easy.
It's very hard.

00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:36.182
Pro-voice is hard because we are talking
about things everyone's fighting about

00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:38.620
or the things that no one 
wants to talk about.

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:46.327
I wish I could tell you that when you 
decide to be pro-voice, that you'll find

00:04:46.365 --> 00:04:50.042
beautiful moments of breakthrough 
and gardens full of flowers,

00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:54.245
where listening and storytelling
creates wonderful "a-ha" moments.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.279
I wish I could tell you that there would
be a feminist welcoming party for you,

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.641
or that there's a long-lost sisterhood
of people who are just ready

00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:05.001
to have your back when you get slammed.

00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:10.546
But it can be vulnerable and exhausting 
to tell our own stories

00:05:10.546 --> 00:05:12.875
when it feels like nobody cares.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.755
And if we truly listen to one another,

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:24.713
we will hear things that demand
that we shift our own perceptions.

00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:28.827
There is no perfect time
and there is no perfect place

00:05:28.827 --> 00:05:31.470
to start a difficult conversation.

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:37.297
There's never a time when everyone will be
on the same page, share the same lens,

00:05:37.414 --> 00:05:39.620
or know the same history.

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:46.470
So, let's talk about listening
and how to be a good listener.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.608
There's lots of ways to be a good listener
and I'm going to give you just a couple.

00:05:50.905 --> 00:05:53.528
One is to ask open-ended questions.

00:05:53.807 --> 00:05:56.519
You can ask yourself or someone 
that you know,

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:59.519
"How are you feeling?"

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:01.005
"What was that like?"

00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:04.255
"What do you hope for, now?"

00:06:06.368 --> 00:06:10.339
Another way to be a good listener 
is to use reflective language.

00:06:10.757 --> 00:06:13.661
If someone is talking about
their own personal experience,

00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:16.074
use the words that they use.

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.487
If someone is talking about an abortion
and they say the word "baby,"

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.043
you can say "baby."

00:06:21.483 --> 00:06:23.550
If they say "fetus,"
you can say "fetus."

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.219
If someone describes themselves
as gender queer to you,

00:06:27.224 --> 00:06:28.914
you can say "gender queer."

00:06:29.782 --> 00:06:33.372
If someone kind of looks like a he,
but they say they're a she -- it's cool.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.787
Call that person a she.

00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:39.618
When we reflect the language of the person
who is sharing their own story,

00:06:39.647 --> 00:06:44.998
we are conveying that we are interested
in understanding who they are

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:46.896
and what they're going through.

00:06:47.745 --> 00:06:51.843
The same way that we hope people are 
interested in knowing us.

00:06:53.062 --> 00:06:56.473
So, I'll never forget being in one 
of the Exhale counselor meetings,

00:06:56.473 --> 00:07:00.374
listening to a volunteer talk about how
she was getting a lot of calls

00:07:00.374 --> 00:07:03.069
from Christian women who 
were talking about God.

00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:08.038
Now, some of our volunteers are religious,
but this particular one was not.

00:07:08.247 --> 00:07:12.138
At first, it felt a little weird for her 
to talk to callers about God.

00:07:12.852 --> 00:07:15.282
So, she decided to get comfortable.

00:07:15.282 --> 00:07:19.137
And she stood in front of her mirror 
at home, and she said the word "God."

00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:20.375
"God."

00:07:20.785 --> 00:07:21.505
"God."

00:07:21.505 --> 00:07:22.225
"God."

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:22.945
"God."

00:07:23.325 --> 00:07:24.027
"God."

00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:24.982
"God."

00:07:25.801 --> 00:07:29.081
Over and over and over again
until the word no longer felt strange

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.211
coming out her mouth.

00:07:31.455 --> 00:07:35.325
Saying the word God did not turn this 
volunteer into a Christian,

00:07:35.395 --> 00:07:40.186
but it did make her a much 
better listener of Christian women.

00:07:42.693 --> 00:07:46.576
So, another way to be pro-voice
is to share stories,

00:07:46.576 --> 00:07:50.796
and one risk that you take on, when you
share your story with someone else,

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:53.983
is that given the same
set of circumstances as you

00:07:53.983 --> 00:07:56.578
they might actually
make a different decision.

00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:01.423
For example, if you're telling a story 
about your abortion,

00:08:01.423 --> 00:08:04.403
realize that she might have had the baby.

00:08:06.284 --> 00:08:08.257
She might have placed for adoption.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.598
She might have told her parents 
and her partner -- or not.

00:08:14.503 --> 00:08:20.215
She might have felt relief and confidence,
even though you felt sad and lost.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.237
This is okay.

00:08:23.723 --> 00:08:29.063
Empathy gets created the moment we
imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes.

00:08:29.606 --> 00:08:33.405
It doesn't mean we all have 
to end up in the same place.

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:40.023
It's not agreement, it's not sameness
that pro-voice is after.

00:08:41.207 --> 00:08:46.965
It creates a culture and a society that 
values what make us special and unique.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:52.630
It values what makes us human,
our flaws and our imperfections.

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:57.517
And this way of thinking allows us to see
our differences with respect,

00:08:57.551 --> 00:08:59.225
instead of fear.

00:09:00.386 --> 00:09:02.600
And it generates the empathy that we need

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.026
to overcome all the ways
that we try to hurt one another.

00:09:06.026 --> 00:09:11.577
Stigma, shame, prejudice, 
discrimination, oppression.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:17.570
Pro-voice is contagious,
and the more it's practiced

00:09:17.603 --> 00:09:19.193
the more it spreads.

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:25.903
So, last year I was pregnant again.

00:09:26.253 --> 00:09:29.549
This time I was looking forward 
to the birth of my son.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:36.886
And while pregnant, I had never been asked
how I was feeling so much in all my life.

00:09:36.927 --> 00:09:38.062
(Laughter)

00:09:38.346 --> 00:09:42.366
And however I replied, whether I was
feeling wonderful and excited

00:09:42.408 --> 00:09:45.152
or scared and totally freaked out,

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:49.578
there was always someone there
giving me a "been there" response.

00:09:49.578 --> 00:09:51.165
It was awesome.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:56.520
It was a welcome, yet dramatic
departure from what I experience

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.128
when I talk about
my mixed feelings of my abortion.

00:10:01.087 --> 00:10:04.864
Pro-voice is about the real stories
of real people

00:10:04.864 --> 00:10:07.444
making an impact on the way abortion

00:10:07.444 --> 00:10:11.542
and so many other politicized
and stigmatized issues

00:10:11.542 --> 00:10:13.642
are understood and discussed.

00:10:13.857 --> 00:10:18.309
From sexuality and mental health
to poverty and incarceration.

00:10:19.562 --> 00:10:23.050
Far beyond definition
as single right or wrong decisions,

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.435
our experiences can exist on a spectrum.

00:10:28.478 --> 00:10:32.800
Pro-voice focuses that conversation
on human experience

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.696
and it makes support and respect
possible for all.

00:10:38.755 --> 00:10:40.181
Thank you.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.199
(Applause)
