00:00:00.597 --> 00:00:02.338
One of my earliest memories

00:00:02.362 --> 00:00:05.458
is of trying to wake up
one of my relatives and not being able to.

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:08.435
And I was just a little kid,
so I didn't really understand why,

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:09.769
but as I got older,

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:11.936
I realized we had
drug addiction in my family,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.794
including later cocaine addiction.

00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:18.597
I'd been thinking about it a lot lately,
partly because it's now exactly 100 years

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:21.667
since drugs were first banned
in the United States and Britain,

00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:24.206
and we then imposed that
on the rest of the world.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.726
It's a century since we made
this really fateful decision

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.803
to take addicts and punish them
and make them suffer,

00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:36.214
because we believed that would deter them;
it would give them an incentive to stop.

00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:41.207
And a few years ago, I was looking at
some of the addicts in my life who I love,

00:00:41.231 --> 00:00:44.620
and trying to figure out
if there was some way to help them.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.894
And I realized there were loads
of incredibly basic questions

00:00:47.918 --> 00:00:49.728
I just didn't know the answer to,

00:00:49.752 --> 00:00:52.168
like, what really causes addiction?

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:55.608
Why do we carry on with this approach
that doesn't seem to be working,

00:00:55.632 --> 00:00:58.537
and is there a better way out there
that we could try instead?

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:00.251
So I read loads of stuff about it,

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:02.942
and I couldn't really find
the answers I was looking for,

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:06.502
so I thought, okay, I'll go and sit
with different people around the world

00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:08.190
who lived this and studied this

00:01:08.214 --> 00:01:10.755
and talk to them and see
if I could learn from them.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:14.256
And I didn't realize I would end up
going over 30,000 miles at the start,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.164
but I ended up going and meeting
loads of different people,

00:01:17.188 --> 00:01:19.943
from a transgender crack dealer
in Brownsville, Brooklyn,

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:23.521
to a scientist who spends a lot of time
feeding hallucinogens to mongooses

00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:24.831
to see if they like them --

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:27.936
it turns out they do, but only
in very specific circumstances --

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.731
to the only country that's ever
decriminalized all drugs,

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:33.110
from cannabis to crack, Portugal.

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:35.711
And the thing I realized
that really blew my mind is,

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:39.519
almost everything we think
we know about addiction is wrong,

00:01:39.543 --> 00:01:42.630
and if we start to absorb
the new evidence about addiction,

00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:46.076
I think we're going to have to change
a lot more than our drug policies.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.501
But let's start with what we think
we know, what I thought I knew.

00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:51.606
Let's think about this middle row here.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.392
Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went
off and used heroin three times a day.

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:58.861
Some of you look a little more
enthusiastic than others at this prospect.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:01:59.885
(Laughter)

00:01:59.914 --> 00:02:02.114
Don't worry,
it's just a thought experiment.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.219
Imagine you did that, right?

00:02:04.243 --> 00:02:05.393
What would happen?

00:02:05.428 --> 00:02:09.221
Now, we have a story about what would
happen that we've been told for a century.

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:11.742
We think, because there are
chemical hooks in heroin,

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:13.529
as you took it for a while,

00:02:13.553 --> 00:02:16.107
your body would become
dependent on those hooks,

00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:17.895
you'd start to physically need them,

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.243
and at the end of those 20 days,
you'd all be heroin addicts. Right?

00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:22.499
That's what I thought.

00:02:22.523 --> 00:02:26.381
First thing that alerted me to the fact
that something's not right with this story

00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:28.059
is when it was explained to me.

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:31.798
If I step out of this TED Talk today
and I get hit by a car and I break my hip,

00:02:31.822 --> 00:02:35.135
I'll be taken to hospital
and I'll be given loads of diamorphine.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.721
Diamorphine is heroin.

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:40.179
It's actually much better heroin
than you're going to buy on the streets,

00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:43.135
because the stuff you buy
from a drug dealer is contaminated.

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.983
Actually, very little of it is heroin,

00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:47.823
whereas the stuff you get
from the doctor is medically pure.

00:02:47.847 --> 00:02:50.419
And you'll be given it for quite
a long period of time.

00:02:50.443 --> 00:02:52.301
There are loads of people in this room,

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:55.286
you may not realize it,
you've taken quite a lot of heroin.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.863
And anyone who is watching this
anywhere in the world, this is happening.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:01.240
And if what we believe
about addiction is right --

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.836
those people are exposed
to all those chemical hooks --

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.070
What should happen?
They should become addicts.

00:03:06.094 --> 00:03:08.036
This has been studied really carefully.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.965
It doesn't happen; you will have noticed
if your grandmother had a hip replacement,

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.013
she didn't come out as a junkie.
(Laughter)

00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:17.626
And when I learned this,
it seemed so weird to me,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.156
so contrary to everything I'd been told,
everything I thought I knew,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.971
I just thought it couldn't be right,
until I met a man called Bruce Alexander.

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:27.593
He's a professor
of psychology in Vancouver

00:03:27.617 --> 00:03:29.532
who carried out an incredible experiment

00:03:29.556 --> 00:03:31.918
I think really helps us
to understand this issue.

00:03:31.942 --> 00:03:33.680
Professor Alexander explained to me,

00:03:33.704 --> 00:03:36.641
the idea of addiction we've all
got in our heads, that story,

00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:38.692
comes partly from a series of experiments

00:03:38.716 --> 00:03:40.802
that were done earlier
in the 20th century.

00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:42.132
They're really simple.

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:45.136
You can do them tonight at home
if you feel a little sadistic.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.717
You get a rat and you put it in a cage,
and you give it two water bottles:

00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:52.485
One is just water, and the other is water
laced with either heroin or cocaine.

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.517
If you do that, the rat will almost always
prefer the drug water

00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:57.679
and almost always
kill itself quite quickly.

00:03:57.703 --> 00:04:00.180
So there you go, right?
That's how we think it works.

00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:03.776
In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes
along and he looks at this experiment

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.056
and he noticed something.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.559
He said ah, we're putting
the rat in an empty cage.

00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:09.816
It's got nothing to do
except use these drugs.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.355
Let's try something different.

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.307
So Professor Alexander built a cage
that he called "Rat Park,"

00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:16.847
which is basically heaven for rats.

00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:19.950
They've got loads of cheese,
they've got loads of colored balls,

00:04:19.974 --> 00:04:21.358
they've got loads of tunnels.

00:04:21.382 --> 00:04:24.573
Crucially, they've got loads of friends.
They can have loads of sex.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:29.387
And they've got both the water bottles,
the normal water and the drugged water.

00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:32.096
But here's the fascinating thing:

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.578
In Rat Park, they don't
like the drug water.

00:04:35.602 --> 00:04:37.291
They almost never use it.

00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:39.868
None of them ever use it compulsively.

00:04:39.892 --> 00:04:41.293
None of them ever overdose.

00:04:41.317 --> 00:04:44.707
You go from almost 100 percent overdose
when they're isolated

00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:47.957
to zero percent overdose when they
have happy and connected lives.

00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:51.227
Now, when he first saw this,
Professor Alexander thought,

00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:54.490
maybe this is just a thing about rats,
they're quite different to us.

00:04:54.514 --> 00:04:56.991
Maybe not as different as we'd like,
but, you know --

00:04:57.015 --> 00:04:59.126
But fortunately, there was
a human experiment

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.255
into the exact same principle happening
at the exact same time.

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.257
It was called the Vietnam War.

00:05:04.281 --> 00:05:08.864
In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American
troops were using loads of heroin,

00:05:08.888 --> 00:05:11.496
and if you look at the news
reports from the time,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.178
they were really worried, because
they thought, my God, we're going to have

00:05:15.202 --> 00:05:18.402
hundreds of thousands of junkies
on the streets of the United States

00:05:18.426 --> 00:05:20.342
when the war ends; it made total sense.

00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:23.652
Now, those soldiers who were using
loads of heroin were followed home.

00:05:23.676 --> 00:05:26.630
The Archives of General Psychiatry
did a really detailed study,

00:05:26.654 --> 00:05:28.558
and what happened to them?

00:05:28.582 --> 00:05:32.142
It turns out they didn't go to rehab.
They didn't go into withdrawal.

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:35.452
Ninety-five percent of them just stopped.

00:05:35.476 --> 00:05:37.877
Now, if you believe the story
about chemical hooks,

00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:41.365
that makes absolutely no sense,
but Professor Alexander began to think

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.696
there might be a different
story about addiction.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.561
He said, what if addiction isn't
about your chemical hooks?

00:05:46.585 --> 00:05:49.231
What if addiction is about your cage?

00:05:49.255 --> 00:05:52.369
What if addiction is an adaptation
to your environment?

00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:53.543
Looking at this,

00:05:53.547 --> 00:05:56.645
there was another professor
called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.116
who said, maybe we shouldn't
even call it addiction.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.864
Maybe we should call it bonding.

00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:03.787
Human beings have a natural
and innate need to bond,

00:06:03.811 --> 00:06:07.365
and when we're happy and healthy,
we'll bond and connect with each other,

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.019
but if you can't do that,

00:06:10.043 --> 00:06:13.843
because you're traumatized or isolated
or beaten down by life,

00:06:13.867 --> 00:06:17.166
you will bond with something
that will give you some sense of relief.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.762
Now, that might be gambling,
that might be pornography,

00:06:19.786 --> 00:06:21.938
that might be cocaine,
that might be cannabis,

00:06:21.962 --> 00:06:25.592
but you will bond and connect
with something because that's our nature.

00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:28.332
That's what we want as human beings.

00:06:28.356 --> 00:06:31.844
And at first, I found this quite
a difficult thing to get my head around,

00:06:31.868 --> 00:06:34.299
but one way that helped me
to think about it is,

00:06:34.323 --> 00:06:37.712
I can see, I've got over by my seat
a bottle of water, right?

00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:41.260
I'm looking at lots of you, and lots
of you have bottles of water with you.

00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:43.099
Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war.

00:06:43.123 --> 00:06:47.766
Totally legally, all of those bottles
of water could be bottles of vodka, right?

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.476
We could all be getting drunk --
I might after this -- (Laughter) --

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.652
but we're not.

00:06:52.676 --> 00:06:56.153
Now, because you've been able to afford
the approximately gazillion pounds

00:06:56.177 --> 00:06:59.558
that it costs to get into a TED Talk,
I'm guessing you guys could afford

00:06:59.582 --> 00:07:01.936
to be drinking vodka
for the next six months.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.907
You wouldn't end up homeless.

00:07:03.931 --> 00:07:07.532
You're not going to do that,
and the reason you're not going to do that

00:07:07.556 --> 00:07:09.435
is not because anyone's stopping you.

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:11.652
It's because you've got
bonds and connections

00:07:11.676 --> 00:07:13.200
that you want to be present for.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.701
You've got work you love.
You've got people you love.

00:07:15.725 --> 00:07:17.746
You've got healthy relationships.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.416
And a core part of addiction,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.917
I came to think, and I believe
the evidence suggests,

00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:26.755
is about not being able to bear
to be present in your life.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.118
Now, this has really
significant implications.

00:07:29.142 --> 00:07:32.276
The most obvious implications
are for the War on Drugs.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.836
In Arizona, I went out
with a group of women

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.694
who were made to wear t-shirts
saying, "I was a drug addict,"

00:07:39.718 --> 00:07:44.471
and go out on chain gangs and dig graves
while members of the public jeer at them,

00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:48.171
and when those women get out of prison,
they're going to have criminal records

00:07:48.195 --> 00:07:50.815
that mean they'll never work
in the legal economy again.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:54.536
Now, that's a very extreme example,
obviously, in the case of the chain gang,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.626
but actually almost
everywhere in the world

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.650
we treat addicts to some degree like that.

00:07:58.674 --> 00:08:01.532
We punish them. We shame them.
We give them criminal records.

00:08:01.556 --> 00:08:04.291
We put barriers between them reconnecting.

00:08:04.315 --> 00:08:07.294
There was a doctor in Canada,
Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man,

00:08:07.318 --> 00:08:11.189
who said to me, if you wanted to design
a system that would make addiction worse,

00:08:11.213 --> 00:08:12.820
you would design that system.

00:08:12.844 --> 00:08:15.700
Now, there's a place that decided
to do the exact opposite,

00:08:15.724 --> 00:08:17.557
and I went there to see how it worked.

00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:20.976
In the year 2000, Portugal had
one of the worst drug problems in Europe.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.975
One percent of the population was addicted
to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing,

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:27.767
and every year, they tried
the American way more and more.

00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:30.744
They punished people and stigmatized them
and shamed them more,

00:08:30.768 --> 00:08:32.587
and every year, the problem got worse.

00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:36.322
And one day, the Prime Minister and
the leader of the opposition got together,

00:08:36.346 --> 00:08:38.325
and basically said, look, we can't go on

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:41.878
with a country where we're having
ever more people becoming heroin addicts.

00:08:41.902 --> 00:08:44.061
Let's set up a panel
of scientists and doctors

00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:46.567
to figure out what would
genuinely solve the problem.

00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:49.840
And they set up a panel led by
an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão,

00:08:49.864 --> 00:08:51.490
to look at all this new evidence,

00:08:51.514 --> 00:08:53.086
and they came back and they said,

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.406
"Decriminalize all drugs
from cannabis to crack, but" --

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.700
and this is the crucial next step --

00:08:59.724 --> 00:09:03.345
"take all the money we used to spend
on cutting addicts off,

00:09:03.369 --> 00:09:04.766
on disconnecting them,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.430
and spend it instead
on reconnecting them with society."

00:09:08.454 --> 00:09:13.026
And that's not really what we think of
as drug treatment

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.908
in the United States and Britain.

00:09:14.932 --> 00:09:16.513
So they do do residential rehab,

00:09:16.537 --> 00:09:19.345
they do psychological therapy,
that does have some value.

00:09:19.369 --> 00:09:22.752
But the biggest thing they did
was the complete opposite of what we do:

00:09:22.776 --> 00:09:25.270
a massive program
of job creation for addicts,

00:09:25.294 --> 00:09:27.890
and microloans for addicts
to set up small businesses.

00:09:27.914 --> 00:09:29.555
So say you used to be a mechanic.

00:09:29.579 --> 00:09:32.376
When you're ready, they'll go
to a garage, and they'll say,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.287
if you employ this guy for a year,
we'll pay half his wages.

00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:38.044
The goal was to make sure
that every addict in Portugal

00:09:38.068 --> 00:09:40.449
had something to get out
of bed for in the morning.

00:09:40.473 --> 00:09:43.644
And when I went and met the addicts
in Portugal,

00:09:43.668 --> 00:09:45.922
what they said is,
as they rediscovered purpose,

00:09:45.946 --> 00:09:49.051
they rediscovered bonds
and relationships with the wider society.

00:09:49.075 --> 00:09:51.695
It'll be 15 years this year
since that experiment began,

00:09:51.719 --> 00:09:53.362
and the results are in:

00:09:53.386 --> 00:09:55.244
injecting drug use is down in Portugal,

00:09:55.268 --> 00:09:57.859
according to the British
Journal of Criminology,

00:09:57.883 --> 00:10:00.446
by 50 percent, five-zero percent.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.146
Overdose is massively down,
HIV is massively down among addicts.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.521
Addiction in every study
is significantly down.

00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:10.384
One of the ways you know it's worked
so well is that almost nobody in Portugal

00:10:10.408 --> 00:10:12.089
wants to go back to the old system.

00:10:12.113 --> 00:10:13.977
Now, that's the political implications.

00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:17.000
I actually think there's a layer
of implications

00:10:17.024 --> 00:10:18.660
to all this research below that.

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:21.946
We live in a culture where people
feel really increasingly vulnerable

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.926
to all sorts of addictions,
whether it's to their smartphones

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.284
or to shopping or to eating.

00:10:26.308 --> 00:10:28.615
Before these talks began --
you guys know this --

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:31.479
we were told we weren't allowed
to have our smartphones on,

00:10:31.503 --> 00:10:34.124
and I have to say, a lot of you
looked an awful lot like

00:10:34.148 --> 00:10:37.133
addicts who were told their dealer
was going to be unavailable

00:10:37.157 --> 00:10:39.062
for the next couple of hours. (Laughter)

00:10:39.086 --> 00:10:41.933
A lot of us feel like that,
and it might sound weird to say,

00:10:41.957 --> 00:10:45.350
I've been talking about how disconnection
is a major driver of addiction

00:10:45.374 --> 00:10:46.803
and weird to say it's growing,

00:10:46.827 --> 00:10:50.399
because you think we're the most connected
society that's ever been, surely.

00:10:50.423 --> 00:10:53.356
But I increasingly began to think
that the connections we have

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.480
or think we have, are like a kind
of parody of human connection.

00:10:56.504 --> 00:10:59.341
If you have a crisis in your life,
you'll notice something.

00:10:59.365 --> 00:11:02.275
It won't be your Twitter followers
who come to sit with you.

00:11:02.299 --> 00:11:05.157
It won't be your Facebook friends
who help you turn it round.

00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:08.324
It'll be your flesh and blood friends
who you have deep and nuanced

00:11:08.348 --> 00:11:10.590
and textured, face-to-face
relationships with,

00:11:10.614 --> 00:11:15.149
and there's a study I learned about from
Bill McKibben, the environmental writer,

00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:17.356
that I think tells us a lot about this.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.754
It looked at the number of close friends
the average American believes

00:11:20.778 --> 00:11:22.705
they can call on in a crisis.

00:11:22.729 --> 00:11:25.723
That number has been declining
steadily since the 1950s.

00:11:25.747 --> 00:11:28.597
The amount of floor space
an individual has in their home

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:30.664
has been steadily increasing,

00:11:30.688 --> 00:11:32.568
and I think that's like a metaphor

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:34.450
for the choice we've made as a culture.

00:11:34.474 --> 00:11:39.325
We've traded floorspace for friends,
we've traded stuff for connections,

00:11:39.349 --> 00:11:42.946
and the result is we are one of the
loneliest societies there has ever been.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.137
And Bruce Alexander, the guy who did
the Rat Park experiment, says,

00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:49.708
we talk all the time in addiction
about individual recovery,

00:11:49.732 --> 00:11:51.635
and it's right to talk about that,

00:11:51.659 --> 00:11:54.190
but we need to talk much more
about social recovery.

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:57.843
Something's gone wrong with us,
not just with individuals but as a group,

00:11:57.867 --> 00:12:00.276
and we've created a society where,
for a lot of us,

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.761
life looks a whole lot more
like that isolated cage

00:12:02.785 --> 00:12:04.832
and a whole lot less like Rat Park.

00:12:04.856 --> 00:12:07.888
If I'm honest, this isn't
why I went into it.

00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:11.218
I didn't go in to the discover
the political stuff, the social stuff.

00:12:11.242 --> 00:12:13.581
I wanted to know how to help
the people I love.

00:12:13.605 --> 00:12:16.844
And when I came back from this
long journey and I'd learned all this,

00:12:16.868 --> 00:12:19.576
I looked at the addicts in my life,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.106
and if you're really candid,
it's hard loving an addict,

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.988
and there's going to be lots of people
who know in this room.

00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:29.236
You are angry a lot of the time,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.261
and I think one of the reasons
why this debate is so charged

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:36.085
is because it runs through the heart
of each of us, right?

00:12:36.109 --> 00:12:39.056
Everyone has a bit of them
that looks at an addict and thinks,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.831
I wish someone would just stop you.

00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:44.617
And the kind of scripts we're told for how
to deal with the addicts in our lives

00:12:44.641 --> 00:12:45.813
is typified by, I think,

00:12:45.837 --> 00:12:48.790
the reality show "Intervention,"
if you guys have ever seen it.

00:12:48.814 --> 00:12:51.488
I think everything in our lives
is defined by reality TV,

00:12:51.512 --> 00:12:52.957
but that's another TED Talk.

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:55.169
If you've ever seen
the show "Intervention,"

00:12:55.193 --> 00:12:56.649
it's a pretty simple premise.

00:12:56.673 --> 00:12:59.769
Get an addict, all the people
in their life, gather them together,

00:12:59.793 --> 00:13:03.425
confront them with what they're doing,
and they say, if you don't shape up,

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:04.787
we're going to cut you off.

00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:07.526
So what they do is they take
the connection to the addict,

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.646
and they threaten it,
they make it contingent

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.048
on the addict behaving the way they want.

00:13:12.072 --> 00:13:15.799
And I began to think, I began to see
why that approach doesn't work,

00:13:15.823 --> 00:13:20.373
and I began to think that's almost like
the importing of the logic of the Drug War

00:13:20.397 --> 00:13:22.254
into our private lives.

00:13:22.278 --> 00:13:25.946
So I was thinking,
how could I be Portuguese?

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.475
And what I've tried to do now,
and I can't tell you I do it consistently

00:13:29.499 --> 00:13:31.448
and I can't tell you it's easy,

00:13:31.472 --> 00:13:33.956
is to say to the addicts in my life

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.206
that I want to deepen
the connection with them,

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.900
to say to them, I love you
whether you're using or you're not.

00:13:39.924 --> 00:13:42.756
I love you, whatever state you're in,

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.171
and if you need me,
I'll come and sit with you

00:13:45.195 --> 00:13:47.795
because I love you and I don't
want you to be alone

00:13:47.819 --> 00:13:49.815
or to feel alone.

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:51.881
And I think the core of that message --

00:13:51.905 --> 00:13:54.574
you're not alone, we love you --

00:13:54.598 --> 00:13:57.663
has to be at every level
of how we respond to addicts,

00:13:57.687 --> 00:14:00.310
socially, politically and individually.

00:14:00.334 --> 00:14:04.582
For 100 years now, we've been singing
war songs about addicts.

00:14:04.606 --> 00:14:08.506
I think all along we should have been
singing love songs to them,

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:12.778
because the opposite of addiction
is not sobriety.

00:14:12.802 --> 00:14:16.633
The opposite of addiction is connection.

00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:18.606
Thank you.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:25.630
(Applause)
