00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I love trees, and I'm very lucky,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
because we live near a wonderful arboretum,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and now, with my four-year-old,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The second school I was at had big trees too,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
around it, around the playing fields.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and taken in the bushes -- I was stripped; I was attacked;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I was abused; and this came out of the blue.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
well, I went back into the school -- I felt dirty; I felt betrayed;

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I felt ashamed, but mainly -- mainly, I felt powerless.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
next to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and we were on a human rights tour,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and, from my very privileged position,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
this was the only reference point that I had.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And it was an amazing learning experience

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
because, for me, human rights have been something in which I had,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
you know, a part-time interest, but, mainly,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
it was something that happened to other people over there.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
he's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
(Laughter) --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
a very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
you know, just after I'd done the Biko song,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
we're going to do a tour for Amnesty,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
you have to be on it, and really that was the first time

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that I'd been out and started meeting people

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
who'd watched their family being shot in front of them,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So I got involved with this tour, which was for Amnesty,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I didn't do it as well, but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour, Sting,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Tracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and it was an amazing experience.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And, once again, I got an extraordinary education,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and it was the first time, really,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and these human rights stories became very physical,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and, again, I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But the thing that really amazed me, that I had no idea,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
was that you could suffer in this way

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and then have your whole experience, your story, denied,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
buried and forgotten.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
or a video or film camera,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
it was a great deal harder to do -- for those in power to bury the story.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and there was a decision then --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
about trying to set up a division

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that was going to give cameras to human rights activists.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
It didn't really get anywhere,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and then the Rodney King incident happened, and people thought,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
OK, if you have a camera in the right place at the right time,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
or, perhaps, the wrong time, depending who you are,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
then you can actually start doing something,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and campaigning, and being heard,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and telling people about what's going on.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So, WITNESS was started in '92

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and it's since given cameras out in over 60 countries.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And we campaign with activist groups

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and help them tell their story and, in fact,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and, although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
this one isn't quite so good.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
In the north of Uganda,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
there are something like 1.5 million internally displaced people,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
people who are not refugees in another country,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
but because of the civil war, which has been going on for about 20 years,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
they have nowhere to live.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
now, what's it called?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I forget the name of the of the army --

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
it's Lord's Resistance Army, I believe --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but the government, also, doesn't have a clean sheet,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
so if we could run the first video.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Music)

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Woman: Life in the camp is never simple. Even today life is difficult.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp ...

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
still exists back home.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Text: "Between Two Fires: Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda"

Man: When we were at home, it was Kony's [rebel] soldiers disturbing us.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
At first, we were safe in the camp.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
(Chanting)

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Jennifer: A soldier walked onto the road, asking where we'd been.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Evelyn and I hid behind my mother.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Evelyn: He ordered us to sit down, so we sat down.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The other soldier also came.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Jennifer: The man came and started undressing me.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The other one carried Evelyn aside.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Man: The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:55.000
They kept telling us, "Tell the truth!" as they beat us.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Woman: They insisted that I was lying.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
At that moment, they fired and shot off my fingers.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I fell. They ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead.

Text: Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1986.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
whether physical or mental,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
to obtain information or a confession, to punish, coerce or intimidate.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Peter Gabriel: So torture is not something that always happens on other soil.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
In my country, it was --

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis;

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
we've got Abu Ghraib; we've got Guantanamo Bay.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and he told me a story that, in the middle of the night, 4 a.m.,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
he'd been taken out of his home in Queens -- taken to a place in the Midwest,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that he was interrogated and tortured

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and returned to the street four weeks later,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
because he had the same -- he was Middle Eastern,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and that may or may not be true --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I didn't think he was a liar, though.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And, I think, if we look around the world,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
as well as the polar ice caps melting,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
human rights, which have been fought for,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
for many hundreds of years in some cases,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
are, also, eroding very fast,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and that is something that we need to take a look at

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and, maybe, start campaigning for.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I mean, here, too, one of our partners was at Van Jones

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and the Books Not Bars project -- they have managed,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
with their footage in California

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
to change the youth correction systems employed,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and it's much -- much -- I think, more humane methods

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
are being looked at, how you should lock up young kids,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and that's questionable to start off.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And as the story of Mr. Morales, just down the road,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
excuse me, Mr. Gabriel,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
No, not at all, no problem, take your time.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
But this, surely, whoever that man is, whatever he's done,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
this is cruel and unusual punishment.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Anyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. Thank you.

(Applause)

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
PG: WITNESS was born of technological innovation --

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
in a sense the small, portable, DV cam

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
was really what allowed it to come into being.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
so that groups can communicate much more effectively,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
campaign much more effectively,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
but now we have the wonderful possibility,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
because that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
all around the world -- and it's very exciting for us.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And so, the dream is that we could have a world

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
has a chance of getting their story uploaded,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
being seen, being watched,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
that they really know that they can be heard,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
that there would be a giant website,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
maybe, a little like Google Earth,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
for the world's inhabitants. In a way

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
what this technology is allowing is, really,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
or who's being beaten up, for the first time,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture --

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
if we can move that into these sort of fields,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
There could be a new movement growing up,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
rising from the ground, reaching for the light,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and growing strong, just like a tree. Thank you.
