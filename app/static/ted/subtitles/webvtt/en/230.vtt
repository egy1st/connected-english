00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this rather long sort of marathon presentation,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've tried to break it up into three parts:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and really address the qualities of the human interface.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And these will be some simple design qualities

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and they will also be some qualities of, if you will,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the intelligence of interaction.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
new media falling very much into that mold.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Again, I will go through them as fast as possible.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And then the last one will be some examples

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I've been able to collect, which I think

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
illustrate this at least as best I can, in the world of entertainment.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
People have this belief -- and I share most of it --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that we will be using the TV screens or their equivalents

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
for electronic books of the future. But then you think,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
"My God! What a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on TV."

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Well, it doesn't have to be terrible.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And that is a slide taken from a TV set

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and it absolutely looks beautiful.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Well, what's happened? How did people get into this mess?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Where you are now, all of a sudden,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
sitting in front of personal computers

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and video text -- teletext systems,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Well, you have to remember that TV was designed

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So you get a 13-inch, 19-inch, whatever, TV,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and then you should multiply that by eight

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and that's the distance you should sit away from the TV set.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Now we've put people 18 inches in front of a TV,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
all of a sudden, are staring you in the face:

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the shadow mask, the scan lines, all of that.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And they can be treated very easily;

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
there are actually ways of getting rid of them,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm talking here a little bit about display technologies.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Let me talk about how you might input information.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And my favorite example is always fingers.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm very interested in touch-sensitive displays.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
High-tech, high-touch. Isn't that what some of you said?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It's certainly a very important medium for input,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and a lot of people think that fingers are a very low-resolution

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
sort of stylus for inputting to a display.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
In fact, they're not: it's really a very, very high-resolution input medium --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
you have to just do it twice, you have to touch the screen

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and then rotate your finger slightly --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and you can move a cursor with great accuracy.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And so when you see on the market these systems

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
it's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
But it, in some sense, misses the point:

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
namely, that fingers are a very, very high-resolution input medium.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Now, what are some of the other advantages?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Well, the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and people don't realize how important that is --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
not having to pick up your fingers to use them. (Laughter)

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
When you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and I will not criticize the mouse too much --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
when you're typing -- what you have -- you want to now put something --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
first of all, you've got to find the mouse.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
You have to probably stop. Maybe not come to a grinding halt,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
but you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and you're going to have to wiggle it a little bit

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to see where the cursor is on the screen.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And then when you finally see where it is,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
then you've got to move it to get the cursor over there,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and then -- "Bang" -- you've got to hit a button or do whatever.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
That's four separate steps versus typing and then touching

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and typing and just doing it all in one motion --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
or one-and-a-half, depending on how you want to count.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Again, what I'm trying to do is just illustrate

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
the kinds of problems that I think face the designers

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
of new computer systems and entertainment systems

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and educational systems

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
from the perspective of the quality of that interface.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And another advantage, of course, of using fingers is you have 10 of them.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And we have never known how to do this technically,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
so this slide is a fake slide.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
We never succeeded in using ten fingers,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
but there are certain things you can do, obviously,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
with more than one-finger input, which is rather fascinating.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
What we did stumble across was something ...

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Again, which is typical of the computer field,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is when you have a bug that you can't get rid of you turn it into a feature.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And maybe ... (Laughter)

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
But the bug in our case was in touch-sensitive displays:

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
we wanted to be able to draw -- you know, rub your finger

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
across the screen to input continuous points --

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and there was just too much friction

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
created between your finger and the glass --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
if glass was the substrate, which it usually is.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So we found that that actually was a feature

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
in the sense you could build a pressure-sensitive display.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And when you touch it with your finger,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
you can actually, then, introduce all the forces on the face of that screen,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and that actually has a certain amount of value.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Let me see if I can load another disc

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and show you, quickly, an example.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Now, imagine a screen, which is not only touch-sensitive now,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
it's pressure-sensitive.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And it's pressure-sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
X, Y, and Z at least in one direction;

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
we couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But let me get rid of the slide,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and let's see if this comes on.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
OK. So there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
The person's just, if you will, pushing on the screen to make a curve.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
But this is the interesting part.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I want to stop it for a second

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
because the movie is very badly made.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And the particular display was built about six years ago,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and when we moved from one room to another room,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So all we have is this record. (Laughter)

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But imagine that screen having lots of objects on it

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and the person has touched an object --

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
one of N -- like he did there, and then pushed on it.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Now, imagine a program

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light:

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
one is an anvil on a fuzzy rug

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and the other one is a ping-pong ball on a sheet of glass.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And when you touch it, you have to really push very hard

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
to move that anvil across the screen,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and yet you touch the ping-pong ball very lightly

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and it just scoots across the screen.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And what you can do -- oops, I didn't mean to do that --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
what you can do is actually feed back to the user

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the feeling of the physical properties.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So again, they don't have to be weight;

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
they could be a general trying to move troops,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and he's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
In fact, they funded it for that very reason.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
(Laughter)

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
The whole notion, then, is one that at the interface

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
there are physical properties in that transducer --

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
in this case it's pressure and touches --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So it's not simply looking at the quality or, if you will, the luxury of that interface,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
but it's actually looking at the idea

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
of presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I want to move on to another example,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
which is one of a different sort, where we're trying to use computer

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Here, the idea is that you're going to take this book,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
if you will, and it's going to come alive.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You're going to sort of breathe life into it.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
We are so used to doing monologues.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Filmmakers, for example, are the experts in monologue making:

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
you make a film and it has a well-formed beginning, middle and end,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and in some sense the art of it is that.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And you then say, "There's an opportunity

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
for making conversational movies." Well, what does that mean?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and all the assumptions of that medium.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So, book writing is the same thing.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
What I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
but you have to keep a few things in mind.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
One is that this book knows about itself.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Each frame of the movie has information about itself.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So it knows, or at least there is computer-readable information

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
in the medium itself. It's just not a static movie frame.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
That's one thing. The other is that you have to realize

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that it is a random access medium,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and you can, in fact, branch and expand and elaborate and shrink.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And here -- again, my favorite example -- is the cookbook,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
the "Larousse Gastronomique."

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And I think I use the example all too often,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
but it's a great one because there is a classic ending in that little

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
encyclopedia-style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and you get to the end of the recipe and it says, "Cook until done."

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Now, that would be, if you will, the top green track,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
which doesn't mean too much. But you might have to elaborate for me

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
or for somebody who isn't an expert, and say,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
"Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes."

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And then for a real beginner, you would go down even further

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and elaborate more -- say, "Open the oven, preheat, wait for the light to go out,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
open the door, don't leave it open too long,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
put the penguin in and shut the door ..." (Laughter) whatever.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And that's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
That's one kind of use of random access.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
the last thing you do is repeat what you just said.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
You try and think of a different way of saying the same thing,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
or if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
then you might say it in a way that you think

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
would have a good impedance match with that student.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
There are all sorts of techniques you will use --

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and again, this is a different kind of branching.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
So, what I will show you is ... it's a rather boring book,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
but I'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
because your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fiction

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and entertainment. And this is a book on how to repair a transmission.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Now, I don't even know what vintage the transmission is,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
but let me just show you very quickly some of it, and we'll move on.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
(Video) Narrator: And continue to get descriptions for each of these chapters.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Nicholas Negroponte: Now, this is his table of contents.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Just a picture of the transmission, and as you rub your finger across the transmission

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
it highlights the various parts.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Narrator: When I find a chapter that I want to see,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
The words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
so I can get a different definition by just touching the word,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and the definition appears, superimposed over the illustration.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:32.000
NN: This is about the oil pan, or the oil filter and all that.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
This is relatively important because it sets the page ...

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Narrator: This is another example of a page with glossary words

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
highlighted in red.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I can get a definition of these words just by touching them,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and the definition will appear in the illustration corner.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I can get back to the illustration, but in this case it's not a single frame,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
but it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
that's described in the text.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
The two-headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
at various speeds, in forward or reverse.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And the movie is displayed as a full frame movie.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Here's another step-by-step procedure, only in this case --

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
NN: Okay, this movie is ... Everybody's heard of sound-sync movies --

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
this is text-sync movies, so as the movie plays, the text gets highlighted.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
We highlight the text as we go through the movie.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Repairman: ... Not too far out. Front poles, preferably.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Don't loosen them too far. If you loosen them too far, you'll have a big mess.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
NN: I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
(Laughter)

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
OK. I'm at the third and last part of this,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
which I said I would make an attempt to at least give you some examples

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And of course, good education has got to be good entertainment,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000
so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
that we've been doing -- in this case, in Senegal --

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
where we have tried to use personal computers

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
as a pedagogical medium. But not as teaching machines at all;

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
the whole notion is to use this as an instrument

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
where there is a complete reversal of roles --

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
the child is, if you will, the teacher and the machine is the student --

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
approximates thinking about thinking.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
But teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And there are just a few slides I want to go through,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
but there's a story I'd like to tell. And that was when,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
before we did this in any developing countries --

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
we're doing it, in fact, in three developing countries right now:

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Pakistan, Colombia and Senegal --

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
we did it in some pretty rough areas of New York City.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And one child, whose name I've forgotten, was about seven or eight years old,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
absolutely considered mentally handicapped --

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000
couldn't read, didn't even make it in the lowest section of the school's classes --

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and was pretty much not in school, though physically there.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
But did hang around the, quote, "computer room,"

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
where there were quite a few computers,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
and learned this particular language called Logo --

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
it was very interesting. And one day, by chance,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000
some visitors from the NIE came by in their double-breasted suits

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
looking at this setup, and none of the children who were normally there,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
except for this one child, were there.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
He was, and he said, "Let me show you how this works,"

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
and they got an absolutely ingenuous, wonderful description of Logo.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And the child was just zipping right through it, showing them all sorts of things

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
until they asked him how to do something which he couldn't explain

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and so he flipped through the manual, found the explanation

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
and typed the command and got it to do what they asked.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
They were delighted, and by the time it was time to go see the principal,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
whom they'd actually come to see -- not the computer room --

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
they went upstairs and they said,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
"This is absolutely remarkable!

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
That child was very articulate and showed us

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
and even dealt with the things he couldn't do automatically

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
with that manual. It was just absolutely fantastic."

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
The principal said, "There's a dreadful mistake,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
because that child can't read.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And you obviously have been hoodwinked

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
or you've talked about somebody else."

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And they all got up and they all went downstairs

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
and the child was still there. And they did something very intelligent:

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
they asked the child, "Can you read?"

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
And the child said, "No, I can't."

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And then they said, "But wait a minute. You

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
just looked through that manual and you found ... "

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
and he said, "Oh, but that's not reading."

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And so they said, "Well, what's reading then?"

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
He says, "Well, reading is this junk they give me in little books to read.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000
It's absolutely irrelevant, (Laughter) and I get nothing for it.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
But here, with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return."

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And it really meant something to the child.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
The child read beautifully, it turned out,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
and was really very competent. So it actually meant something.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000
but wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
and it is: when does it mean something to a child?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
There is a myth, and it truly is a myth:

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
we believe -- and I'm sure a lot of you believe in this room --

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
that it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
And it's not, but we think speech -- "My God, little children pick it up somehow,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
and by the age of two they're doing a mediocre job,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
and by three and four they're speaking reasonably well.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
And yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Hence, it must be harder." Well, it's not harder.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000
What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child;

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
the child can get a great deal by talking to you.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Reading and writing is utterly useless.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
There is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
and that it's going to help you. (Laughter)

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
So what happens is you go to school and people say,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
"Just believe me, you're going to like it.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
You're going to like reading," and just read and read.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
On the other hand, you give a kid -- a three-year-old kid -- a computer

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
and they type a little command and -- Poof! -- something happens.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And all of a sudden ... You may not call that reading and writing,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
but a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
has a huge payoff, and it's a lot of fun.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And in fact, it's a powerful educational instrument.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Well, in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom:

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
120 kids -- three per desk -- one teacher, a little bit of chalk.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
This student was one of our first students,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
and it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
and she came ... within two days --

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
I want to show you the program she wrote,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
and remember her hairstyle. And that is the program she made.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
That's what meant something to her, is doing the hair pattern,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day --

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
and found it was, to her,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
absolutely the most meaningful piece ...

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
But rooted in that, little did she know how much knowledge

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
she was acquiring about geometry

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
and just math and logic and all the rest.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
And again, I could talk for three hours about this subject.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000
I will come to my last example and then quit.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And my last example -- as some of my former colleagues,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
whom I see in the room, can imagine what it will be.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Yes, it is. It's our work -- that was a while ago,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
and it still is my favorite project -- of teleconferencing.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And the reason it remains a favorite project

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000
is that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
where you had the following situation:

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
you had five people at five different sites -- they were known people --

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
and you had to have these people in teleconference,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
such that each one was utterly convinced

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
that the other four were physically present.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Now, that is sufficiently

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
zany that we would, obviously, jump to the bait, and we did.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And the fact that we knew the people --

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
we had to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney --

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
we actually went so far as to build CRTs

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
in the shapes of the people's faces.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
So if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
(Laughter)

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
and that would be the TV used for the occasion.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
And it's uncanny: there's no way I can explain to you

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
the amount of eye contact you get with that physical face

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
projected on a 3D CRT of that sort.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
The next thing that we had to do is to persuade them

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
that there needed to be spatial correspondence, which is straightforward,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
but again, it's something that didn't fall naturally

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
out of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking;

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
it was a very, if you will, architectural or spatial concept.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
And that was to recognize that when you sit around the table,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
the actual location of the people becomes rather important.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
And when somebody gets up, in fact, to go answer a phone

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
or use a bathroom or something, the empty seat becomes,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
if you will, that person. And you point frequently to the empty seat

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
and you say, "He or she wouldn't agree,"

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
So we said, "Well, these will be on round tables

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
and the order around the table had to be the same,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
so that at my site, I would be, if you will, real

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
and then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
And the plastic heads, sometimes you want to project them.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
And there are a number of schemes, which I don't want to dwell on,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
but this is the one that we finally used

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
where we projected onto rear screen material

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
that was molded in the face -- literally in the face of the person.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
And I'll show you one more slide, where this is actually made

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
from something called a solid photograph and is the screen.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Now, we track, on the person's head, the head motions --

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
so we transmit with a video the head positions --

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000
and so this head moves in about two axes.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
So if I, all of a sudden, turn to the person to my left

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
and start talking to that person, then at the person to my right's site,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And then if that person interrupts, then those two heads may turn.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
And it really is reconstructing, quite accurately, teleconferencing.
