00:00:01.793 --> 00:00:06.785
So, people are more afraid of insects
than they are of dying.

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:08.587
(Laughter)

00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:13.119
At least, according to a 1973
"Book of Lists" survey

00:00:13.143 --> 00:00:20.143
which preceded all those online best,
worst, funniest lists that you see today.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:23.805
Only heights and public speaking

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.365
exceeded the six-legged
as sources of fear.

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:31.436
And I suspect if you had put
spiders in there,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.989
the combinations of insects and spiders
would have just topped the chart.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.839
Now, I am not one of those people.

00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:41.009
I really love insects.

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:45.084
I think they're interesting and beautiful,

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:46.596
and sometimes even cute.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.087
(Laughter)

00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:49.479
And I'm not alone.

00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:53.209
For centuries, some
of the greatest minds in science,

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:56.245
from Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson,

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.550
have drawn inspiration from studying
some of the smallest minds on Earth.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.362
Well, why is that?

00:01:04.386 --> 00:01:07.431
What is that keeps us
coming back to insects?

00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:12.654
Some of it, of course, is just the sheer
magnitude of almost everything about them.

00:01:12.678 --> 00:01:15.665
They're more numerous
than any other kind of animal.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.513
We don't even know how many species
of insects there are,

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:21.254
because new ones
are being discovered all the time.

00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:24.903
There are at least a million,
maybe as many as 10 million.

00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:29.485
This means that you could have
an insect-of-the-month calendar

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.494
and not have to reuse a species
for over 80,000 years.

00:01:33.518 --> 00:01:36.418
(Laughter)

00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:38.130
Take that, pandas and kittens!

00:01:38.154 --> 00:01:40.482
(Laughter)

00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:43.974
More seriously, insects are essential.

00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:45.445
We need them.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.869
It's been estimated
that 1 out of every 3 bites of food

00:01:48.893 --> 00:01:51.567
is made possible by a pollinator.

00:01:52.972 --> 00:01:56.199
Scientist use insects to make fundamental
discoveries

00:01:56.223 --> 00:01:59.124
about everything from the structure
of our nervous systems

00:01:59.148 --> 00:02:01.296
to how our genes and DNA work.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.266
But what I love most about insects

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.071
is what they can tell us
about our own behavior.

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.596
Insects seem like they do
everything that people do.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.159
They meet, they mate,
they fight, they break up.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.570
And they do so with what looks
like love or animosity.

00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:24.876
But what drives their behaviors is really
different than what drives our own,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.474
and that difference
can be really illuminating.

00:02:28.234 --> 00:02:30.101
There's nowhere where that's more true

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:33.686
than when it comes to one
of our most consuming interests -- sex.

00:02:34.142 --> 00:02:36.975
Now, I will maintain.
and I think I can defend,

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:39.400
what may seem like a surprising statement.

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:44.296
I think sex in insects is more
interesting than sex in people.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.107
(Laughter)

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:49.270
And the wild variety that we see

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:52.207
makes us challenge
some of our own assumptions

00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:54.955
about what it means to be male and female.

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:57.314
Of course, to start with,

00:02:57.338 --> 00:03:00.295
a lot of insects don't need
to have sex at all to reproduce.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.749
Female aphids can make little, tiny clones
of themselves without ever mating.

00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.914
Virgin birth, right there.

00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:08.226
On your rose bushes.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.446
(Laughter)

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.011
When they do have sex,

00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:16.292
even their sperm is more
interesting than human sperm.

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:18.691
There are some kinds of fruit flies

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:22.192
whose sperm is longer
than the male's own body.

00:03:22.216 --> 00:03:26.476
And that's important because the males
use their sperm to compete.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:31.060
Now, male insects do compete with weapons,
like the horns on these beetles.

00:03:31.553 --> 00:03:35.797
But they also compete
after mating with their sperm.

00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:41.852
Dragonflies and damselflies have penises
that look kind of like Swiss Army knives

00:03:41.876 --> 00:03:43.969
with all of the attachments pulled out.

00:03:43.993 --> 00:03:45.863
(Laughter)

00:03:45.887 --> 00:03:50.033
They use these formidable devices
like scoops,

00:03:50.057 --> 00:03:54.794
to remove the sperm from previous males
that the female has mated with.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.885
(Laughter)

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.606
So, what can we learn from this?

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.309
(Laughter)

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:10.343
All right, it is not a lesson in the sense
of us imitating them

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:13.891
or of them setting
an example for us to follow.

00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:17.241
Which, given this,
is probably just as well.

00:04:17.265 --> 00:04:20.839
And also, did I mention sexual cannibalism
is rampant among insects?

00:04:20.863 --> 00:04:23.191
So, no, that's not the point.

00:04:23.215 --> 00:04:24.952
But what I think insects do,

00:04:24.976 --> 00:04:30.965
is break a lot of the rules
that we humans have about the sex roles.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:36.848
So, people have this idea that nature
dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version

00:04:36.872 --> 00:04:38.827
of what males and females are like.

00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:42.004
So that males are always
supposed to be dominant and aggressive,

00:04:42.028 --> 00:04:43.770
and females are passive and coy.

00:04:43.794 --> 00:04:45.744
But that's just not the case.

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:48.668
So for example, take katydids,

00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:51.534
which are relatives of crickets
and grasshoppers.

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:55.035
The males are very picky
about who they mate with,

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:58.284
because they not only transfer
sperm during mating,

00:04:58.308 --> 00:05:02.774
they also give the female
something called a nuptial gift.

00:05:02.798 --> 00:05:06.475
You can see two katydids
mating in these photos.

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:08.819
In both panels,
the male's the one on the right,

00:05:08.843 --> 00:05:12.423
and that sword-like appendage
is the female's egg-laying organ.

00:05:13.126 --> 00:05:15.653
The white blob is the sperm,

00:05:15.677 --> 00:05:19.063
the green blob is the nuptial gift,

00:05:19.087 --> 00:05:22.453
and the male manufactures
this from his own body

00:05:22.477 --> 00:05:24.655
and it's extremely costly to produce.

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:27.387
It can weigh up to a third
of his body mass.

00:05:27.985 --> 00:05:30.519
I will now pause for a moment
and let you think about

00:05:30.543 --> 00:05:34.706
what it would be like if human men,
every time they had sex,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:40.777
had to produce something
that weighed 50, 60, 70 pounds.

00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:44.408
(Laughter)

00:05:44.432 --> 00:05:47.671
Okay, they would not be able
to do that very often.

00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:49.192
(Laughter)

00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:51.617
And indeed, neither can the katydids.

00:05:52.343 --> 00:05:54.255
And so what that means

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:58.087
is the katydid males are very choosy

00:05:58.111 --> 00:06:01.191
about who they offer
these nuptial gifts to.

00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:03.141
Now, the gift is very nutritious,

00:06:03.165 --> 00:06:05.859
and the female eats it
during and after mating.

00:06:05.883 --> 00:06:08.240
So, the bigger it is,
the better off the male is,

00:06:08.264 --> 00:06:10.440
because that means more time for his sperm

00:06:10.464 --> 00:06:12.912
to drain into her body
and fertilize her eggs.

00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:17.871
But it also means that the males
are very passive about mating,

00:06:17.895 --> 00:06:21.420
whereas the females
are extremely aggressive and competitive,

00:06:21.444 --> 00:06:25.760
in an attempt to get as many of these
nutritious nuptial gifts as they can.

00:06:25.784 --> 00:06:29.579
So, it's not exactly
a stereotypical set of rules.

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:32.685
Even more generally though,

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:37.773
males are actually not all that important
in the lives of a lot of insects.

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:42.226
In the social insects --
the bees and wasps and ants --

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.845
the individuals that you see every day --

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:47.314
the ants going back and forth
to your sugar bowl,

00:06:47.338 --> 00:06:50.347
the honey bees that are flitting
from flower to flower --

00:06:50.371 --> 00:06:52.670
all of those are always female.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.876
People have had a hard time getting
their head around that idea for millennia.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.998
The ancient Greeks knew that there was
a class of bees, the drones,

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:05.073
that are larger than the workers,

00:07:05.097 --> 00:07:07.667
although they disapproved
of the drones' laziness

00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:10.746
because they could see that
the drones just hang around the hive

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.295
until the mating flight --

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.538
they're the males.

00:07:13.562 --> 00:07:15.581
They hang around until the mating flight,

00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:18.344
but they don't participate
in gathering nectar or pollen.

00:07:18.368 --> 00:07:20.652
The Greeks couldn't figure out
the drones' sex,

00:07:20.676 --> 00:07:25.243
and part of the confusion was that they
were aware of the stinging ability of bees

00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:28.124
but they found it difficult to believe

00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:31.395
that any animals that bore such a weapon
could possibly be a female.

00:07:31.705 --> 00:07:34.715
Aristotle tried to get involved as well.

00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:39.327
He suggested, "OK, if the stinging
individuals are going to be the males ..."

00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:41.817
Then he got confused,
because that would have meant

00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:44.570
the males were also taking care
of the young in a colony,

00:07:44.594 --> 00:07:49.002
and he seemed to think
that would be completely impossible.

00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:52.075
He then concluded that maybe
bees had the organs of both sexes

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:53.250
in the same individual,

00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:55.843
which is not that far-fetched,
some animals do that,

00:07:55.867 --> 00:07:58.120
but he never really
did get it figured out.

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:02.530
And you know, even today,
my students, for instance,

00:08:02.554 --> 00:08:07.245
call every animal they see,
including insects, a male.

00:08:07.585 --> 00:08:11.121
And when I tell them
that the ferocious army-ant soldiers

00:08:11.145 --> 00:08:14.078
with their giant jaws,
used to defend the colony,

00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:17.204
are all always female,

00:08:17.228 --> 00:08:19.562
they seem to not quite believe me.

00:08:19.586 --> 00:08:20.731
(Laughter)

00:08:20.755 --> 00:08:25.955
And certainly all of the movies --
Antz, Bee Movie --

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:31.834
portray the main character
in the social insects as being male.

00:08:32.869 --> 00:08:34.673
Well, what difference does this make?

00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:36.334
These are movies. They're fiction.

00:08:36.358 --> 00:08:37.980
They have talking animals in them.

00:08:38.004 --> 00:08:41.684
What difference does it make
if they talk like Jerry Seinfeld?

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.872
I think it does matter,

00:08:43.896 --> 00:08:46.760
and it's a problem that actually
is part of a much deeper one

00:08:46.784 --> 00:08:50.913
that has implications
for medicine and health

00:08:50.937 --> 00:08:53.571
and a lot of other aspects of our lives.

00:08:53.595 --> 00:08:57.088
You all know that scientists
use what we call model systems,

00:08:57.112 --> 00:09:00.473
which are creatures --
white rats or fruit flies --

00:09:00.497 --> 00:09:05.051
that are kind of stand-ins
for all other animals, including people.

00:09:05.075 --> 00:09:08.019
And the idea is
that what's true for a person

00:09:08.043 --> 00:09:10.454
will also be true for the white rat.

00:09:10.478 --> 00:09:13.458
And by and large,
that turns out to be the case.

00:09:13.482 --> 00:09:17.243
But you can take the idea
of a model system too far.

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:20.193
And what I think we've done,

00:09:20.217 --> 00:09:25.668
is use males, in any species,
as though they are the model system.

00:09:25.692 --> 00:09:26.915
The norm.

00:09:26.939 --> 00:09:29.486
The way things are supposed to be.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.559
And females as a kind of variant --

00:09:32.583 --> 00:09:36.310
something special that you only study
after you get the basics down.

00:09:37.802 --> 00:09:40.485
And so, back to the insects.

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:41.857
I think what that means

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.700
is that people just couldn't see
what was in front of them.

00:09:44.724 --> 00:09:51.160
Because they assumed that the world's
stage was largely occupied by male players

00:09:51.184 --> 00:09:55.036
and females would only have
minor, walk-on roles.

00:09:55.626 --> 00:10:01.065
But when we do that, we really miss out
on a lot of what nature is like.

00:10:01.588 --> 00:10:08.587
And we can also miss out on the way
natural, living things, including people,

00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:10.001
can vary.

00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:15.100
And I think that's why we've used males
as models in a lot of medical research,

00:10:15.124 --> 00:10:17.189
something that we know now to be a problem

00:10:17.213 --> 00:10:21.610
if we want the results to apply
to both men and women.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.287
Well, the last thing
I really love about insects

00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:28.572
is something that a lot of people
find unnerving about them.

00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:30.363
They have little, tiny brains

00:10:30.387 --> 00:10:33.780
with very little cognitive ability,
the way we normally think of it.

00:10:34.398 --> 00:10:39.074
They have complicated behavior,
but they lack complicated brains.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.037
And so, we can't just think of them
as though they're little people

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.606
because they don't do things
the way that we do.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.730
I really love that it's difficult
to anthropomorphize insects,

00:10:52.754 --> 00:10:56.277
to look at them and just think of them
like they're little people

00:10:56.301 --> 00:10:58.439
in exoskeletons, with six legs.

00:10:58.927 --> 00:11:00.188
(Laughter)

00:11:00.212 --> 00:11:03.757
Instead, you really have to accept them
on their own terms,

00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:08.914
because insects make us question
what's normal and what's natural.

00:11:09.527 --> 00:11:14.160
Now, you know, people write fiction
and talk about parallel universes.

00:11:14.184 --> 00:11:17.482
They speculate about the supernatural,

00:11:17.506 --> 00:11:20.939
maybe the spirits of the departed
walking among us.

00:11:22.537 --> 00:11:25.733
The allure of another world

00:11:25.757 --> 00:11:31.911
is something that people say is part of
why they want to dabble in the paranormal.

00:11:32.376 --> 00:11:34.665
But as far as I'm concerned,

00:11:34.689 --> 00:11:36.858
who needs to be able to see dead people,

00:11:36.882 --> 00:11:38.560
when you can see live insects?

00:11:39.262 --> 00:11:40.424
Thank you.

00:11:40.448 --> 00:11:44.931
(Applause)
