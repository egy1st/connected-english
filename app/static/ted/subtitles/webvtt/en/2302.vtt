00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:05.439
In the early days of Twitter,
it was like a place of radical de-shaming.

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:08.411
People would admit
shameful secrets about themselves,

00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:12.929
and other people would say,
"Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."

00:00:12.953 --> 00:00:15.755
Voiceless people realized
that they had a voice,

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.734
and it was powerful and eloquent.

00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:23.527
If a newspaper ran some racist
or homophobic column,

00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:25.942
we realized we could do
something about it.

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.335
We could get them.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.811
We could hit them with a weapon
that we understood but they didn't --

00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:33.010
a social media shaming.

00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:36.496
Advertisers would withdraw
their advertising.

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.943
When powerful people
misused their privilege,

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:41.630
we were going to get them.

00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:45.092
This was like the
democratization of justice.

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:47.519
Hierarchies were being leveled out.

00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:49.541
We were going to do things better.

00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:54.964
Soon after that, a disgraced
pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer --

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:58.123
he'd been caught plagiarizing
and faking quotes,

00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:01.879
and he was drenched in shame
and regret, he told me.

00:01:01.903 --> 00:01:03.394
And he had the opportunity

00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:07.248
to publicly apologize
at a foundation lunch.

00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:10.203
This was going to be the most
important speech of his life.

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:12.511
Maybe it would win him some salvation.

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:14.443
He knew before he arrived

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:17.546
that the foundation was going to be
live-streaming his event,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.594
but what he didn't know
until he turned up,

00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:24.546
was that they'd erected a giant screen
Twitter feed right next to his head.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.062
(Laughter)

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.629
Another one in a monitor screen
in his eye line.

00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:32.089
I don't think the foundation did this
because they were monstrous.

00:01:32.113 --> 00:01:35.267
I think they were clueless:
I think this was a unique moment

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:37.828
when the beautiful naivety of Twitter

00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:41.161
was hitting the increasingly
horrific reality.

00:01:41.807 --> 00:01:45.160
And here were some of the Tweets
that were cascading into his eye line,

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:46.910
as he was trying to apologize:

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:50.196
"Jonah Lehrer, boring us
into forgiving him."

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.295
(Laughter)

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.787
And, "Jonah Lehrer has not proven
that he is capable of feeling shame."

00:01:56.589 --> 00:02:00.280
That one must have been written
by the best psychiatrist ever,

00:02:00.304 --> 00:02:03.779
to know that about such
a tiny figure behind a lectern.

00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:07.152
And, "Jonah Lehrer is just
a frigging sociopath."

00:02:07.874 --> 00:02:13.274
That last word is a very human thing
to do, to dehumanize the people we hurt.

00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:17.475
It's because we want to destroy people
but not feel bad about it.

00:02:18.503 --> 00:02:20.951
Imagine if this was an actual court,

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:23.801
and the accused was in the dark,
begging for another chance,

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:25.566
and the jury was yelling out,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.277
"Bored! Sociopath!"

00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:29.442
(Laughter)

00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:32.485
You know, when we watch
courtroom dramas, we tend to identify

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.480
with the kindhearted defense attorney,

00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:39.010
but give us the power,
and we become like hanging judges.

00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:41.819
Power shifts fast.

00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:46.780
We were getting Jonah because he was
perceived to have misused his privilege,

00:02:46.804 --> 00:02:50.087
but Jonah was on the floor then,
and we were still kicking,

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:52.893
and congratulating ourselves
for punching up.

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:57.933
And it began to feel weird and empty
when there wasn't a powerful person

00:02:57.957 --> 00:03:00.975
who had misused their privilege
that we could get.

00:03:01.332 --> 00:03:04.634
A day without a shaming
began to feel like a day

00:03:04.658 --> 00:03:07.585
picking fingernails and treading water.

00:03:09.387 --> 00:03:10.783
Let me tell you a story.

00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:13.982
It's about a woman called Justine Sacco.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.744
She was a PR woman from New York
with 170 Twitter followers,

00:03:18.768 --> 00:03:21.724
and she'd Tweet little
acerbic jokes to them,

00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:25.371
like this one on a plane
from New York to London:

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:28.906
[Weird German Dude: You're in first class.
It's 2014. Get some deodorant."

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.032
-Inner monologue as inhale BO.
Thank god for pharmaceuticals.]

00:03:32.056 --> 00:03:35.319
So Justine chuckled to herself,
and pressed send, and got no replies,

00:03:35.343 --> 00:03:37.404
and felt that sad feeling that we all feel

00:03:37.428 --> 00:03:41.062
when the Internet doesn't
congratulate us for being funny.

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:42.257
(Laughter)

00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:45.404
Black silence when the Internet
doesn't talk back.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:49.182
And then she got to Heathrow,
and she had a little time to spare

00:03:49.206 --> 00:03:53.982
before her final leg, so she thought up
another funny little acerbic joke:

00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:58.328
[Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS.
Just kidding. I'm white!]

00:03:58.352 --> 00:04:04.478
And she chuckled to herself, pressed send,
got on the plane, got no replies,

00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:07.085
turned off her phone, fell asleep,

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.098
woke up 11 hours later,

00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:12.716
turned on her phone while the plane
was taxiing on the runway,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.097
and straightaway there was
a message from somebody

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:17.217
that she hadn't spoken
to since high school,

00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:21.988
that said, "I am so sorry
to see what's happening to you."

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:25.793
And then another message
from a best friend,

00:04:25.817 --> 00:04:27.831
"You need to call me right now.

00:04:27.855 --> 00:04:31.868
You are the worldwide number one
trending topic on Twitter."

00:04:31.892 --> 00:04:33.602
(Laughter)

00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:37.704
What had happened is that one
of her 170 followers had sent the Tweet

00:04:37.728 --> 00:04:42.628
to a Gawker journalist, and he
retweeted it to his 15,000 followers:

00:04:43.506 --> 00:04:45.872
[And now, a funny holiday joke
from IAC's PR boss]

00:04:45.896 --> 00:04:47.859
And then it was like a bolt of lightning.

00:04:47.883 --> 00:04:50.385
A few weeks later, I talked
to the Gawker journalist.

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.097
I emailed him and asked him how it felt,
and he said, "It felt delicious."

00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:57.003
And then he said,
"But I'm sure she's fine."

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.761
But she wasn't fine,
because while she slept,

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:06.269
Twitter took control of her life
and dismantled it piece by piece.

00:05:07.147 --> 00:05:09.542
First there were the philanthropists:

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:12.048
[If @JustineSacco's unfortunate
words ... bother you,

00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:14.219
join me in supporting
@CARE's work in Africa.]

00:05:14.243 --> 00:05:18.032
[In light of ... disgusting,
racist tweet, I'm donating to @care today]

00:05:18.056 --> 00:05:19.547
Then came the beyond horrified:

00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:23.587
[... no words for that horribly disgusting
racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco.

00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:24.762
I am beyond horrified.]

00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:27.039
Was anybody on Twitter
that night? A few of you.

00:05:27.063 --> 00:05:30.533
Did Justine's joke overwhelm
your Twitter feed the way it did mine?

00:05:30.557 --> 00:05:33.449
It did mine, and I thought
what everybody thought that night,

00:05:33.473 --> 00:05:36.561
which was, "Wow, somebody's screwed!

00:05:36.585 --> 00:05:38.925
Somebody's life is about to get terrible!"

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.257
And I sat up in my bed,

00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:43.205
and I put the pillow behind my head,

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.476
and then I thought, I'm not entirely sure
that joke was intended to be racist.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.262
Maybe instead of gleefully
flaunting her privilege,

00:05:51.286 --> 00:05:53.886
she was mocking the gleeful
flaunting of privilege.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.723
There's a comedy tradition of this,

00:05:55.747 --> 00:05:59.435
like South Park or Colbert
or Randy Newman.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:03.904
Maybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being
as good at it as Randy Newman.

00:06:04.444 --> 00:06:07.364
In fact, when I met Justine
a couple of weeks later in a bar,

00:06:07.388 --> 00:06:09.477
she was just crushed,

00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:11.450
and I asked her to explain the joke,

00:06:11.474 --> 00:06:15.109
and she said, "Living in America
puts us in a bit of a bubble

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:17.627
when it comes to what is going on
in the Third World.

00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:19.848
I was making of fun of that bubble."

00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:24.734
You know, another woman on Twitter that
night, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis,

00:06:24.758 --> 00:06:28.406
she reviewed my book on public shaming
and wrote that she Tweeted that night,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.720
"I'm not sure that her joke
was intended to be racist,"

00:06:31.744 --> 00:06:34.483
and she said straightaway she got
a fury of Tweets saying,

00:06:34.507 --> 00:06:36.960
"Well, you're just
a privileged bitch, too."

00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:39.220
And so to her shame, she wrote,

00:06:39.244 --> 00:06:43.776
she shut up and watched
as Justine's life got torn apart.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.506
It started to get darker:

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.440
[Everyone go report
this cunt @JustineSacco]

00:06:50.464 --> 00:06:53.050
Then came the calls for her to be fired.

00:06:53.074 --> 00:06:55.946
[Good luck with the job hunt
in the new year. #GettingFired]

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.705
Thousands of people around the world

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.256
decided it was their duty
to get her fired.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.450
[@JustineSacco last tweet
of your career. #SorryNotSorry

00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:08.337
Corporations got involved,
hoping to sell their products

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:10.718
on the back of Justine's annihilation:

00:07:10.742 --> 00:07:13.959
[Next time you plan to tweet something
stupid before you take off,

00:07:13.983 --> 00:07:16.134
make sure you are getting
on a @Gogo flight!]

00:07:16.158 --> 00:07:18.564
(Laughter)

00:07:18.588 --> 00:07:21.194
A lot of companies were making
good money that night.

00:07:21.218 --> 00:07:25.135
You know, Justine's name was normally
Googled 40 times a month.

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:28.487
That month, between December the 20th
and the end of December,

00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:33.264
her name was Googled 1,220,000 times.

00:07:33.893 --> 00:07:37.418
And one Internet economist told me
that that meant that Google made

00:07:37.442 --> 00:07:42.452
somewhere between 120,000 dollars
and 468,000 dollars

00:07:42.476 --> 00:07:46.542
from Justine's annihilation, whereas
those of us doing the actual shaming --

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:47.720
we got nothing.

00:07:47.744 --> 00:07:48.744
(Laughter)

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:52.218
We were like unpaid
shaming interns for Google.

00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:55.529
(Laughter)

00:07:55.553 --> 00:07:57.949
And then came the trolls:

00:07:57.973 --> 00:08:00.704
[I'm actually kind of hoping
Justine Sacco gets aids? lol]

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:02.134
Somebody else on that wrote,

00:08:02.158 --> 00:08:05.407
"Somebody HIV-positive should rape
this bitch and then we'll find out

00:08:05.431 --> 00:08:07.510
if her skin color protects her from AIDS."

00:08:07.534 --> 00:08:10.113
And that person got a free pass.

00:08:10.137 --> 00:08:12.224
Nobody went after that person.

00:08:12.248 --> 00:08:14.883
We were all so excited
about destroying Justine,

00:08:14.907 --> 00:08:17.534
and our shaming brains
are so simple-minded,

00:08:17.558 --> 00:08:19.943
that we couldn't also handle
destroying somebody

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:22.904
who was inappropriately
destroying Justine.

00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:27.223
Justine was really uniting
a lot of disparate groups that night,

00:08:27.247 --> 00:08:30.183
from philanthropists to "rape the bitch."

00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:34.506
[@JustineSacco I hope you get fired!
You demented bitch...

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.118
Just let the world know you're planning
to ride bare back while in Africa.]

00:08:38.142 --> 00:08:40.167
Women always have it worse than men.

00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:43.292
When a man gets shamed, it's,
"I'm going to get you fired."

00:08:43.316 --> 00:08:45.014
When a woman gets shamed, it's,

00:08:45.038 --> 00:08:49.919
"I'm going to get you fired
and raped and cut out your uterus."

00:08:49.943 --> 00:08:52.352
And then Justine's employers got involved:

00:08:52.376 --> 00:08:55.682
[IAC on @JustineSacco tweet: This is an
outrageous, offensive comment.

00:08:55.706 --> 00:08:58.680
Employee in question currently
unreachable on an intl flight.]

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.902
And that's when the anger
turned to excitement:

00:09:00.926 --> 00:09:04.548
[All I want for Christmas is to see
@JustineSacco's face when her plane lands

00:09:04.572 --> 00:09:06.573
and she checks
her inbox/voicemail. #fired]

00:09:06.597 --> 00:09:09.288
[Oh man, @justinesacco
is going to have the most painful

00:09:09.312 --> 00:09:11.711
phone-turning-on moment ever
when her plane lands.]

00:09:11.735 --> 00:09:15.151
[We are about to watch this @JustineSacco
bitch get fired. In REAL time.

00:09:15.175 --> 00:09:17.199
Before she even KNOWS
she's getting fired.]

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.236
What we had was
a delightful narrative arc.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.085
We knew something that Justine didn't.

00:09:21.109 --> 00:09:23.450
Can you think of anything
less judicial than this?

00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:26.351
Justine was asleep on a plane
and unable to explain herself,

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:29.938
and her inability was
a huge part of the hilarity.

00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:34.917
On Twitter that night, we were
like toddlers crawling towards a gun.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.794
Somebody worked out exactly
which plane she was on, so they linked

00:09:38.818 --> 00:09:40.917
to a flight tracker website.

00:09:40.941 --> 00:09:44.053
[British Airways Flight 43
On-time - arrives in 1 hour 34 minutes]

00:09:44.077 --> 00:09:46.532
A hashtag began trending worldwide:

00:09:46.556 --> 00:09:49.158
# hasJustineLandedYet?

00:09:49.182 --> 00:09:51.348
[It is kinda wild
to see someone self-destruct

00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:54.095
without them even being aware of it.
#hasJustineLandedYet]

00:09:54.119 --> 00:09:57.513
[Seriously. I just want to go home
to go to bed, but everyone at the bar

00:09:57.537 --> 00:10:00.497
is SO into #HasJustineLandedYet.
Can't look away. Can't leave.]

00:10:00.521 --> 00:10:04.007
[#HasJustineLandedYet may be the best
thing to happen to my Friday night.]

00:10:04.031 --> 00:10:07.134
[Is no one in Cape Town going
to the airport to tweet her arrival?

00:10:07.158 --> 00:10:08.877
Come on, twitter! I'd like pictures]

00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:10.417
And guess what? Yes there was.

00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:13.307
[@JustineSacco HAS in fact landed
at Cape Town international.

00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:15.863
And if you want to know
what it looks like to discover

00:10:15.887 --> 00:10:19.462
that you've just been torn to shreds
because of a misconstrued liberal joke,

00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:21.494
not by trolls, but by nice people like us,

00:10:21.518 --> 00:10:23.064
this is what it looks like:

00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:25.742
[... She's decided to wear
sunnies as a disguise.]

00:10:25.766 --> 00:10:27.219
So why did we do it?

00:10:27.933 --> 00:10:30.834
I think some people were genuinely upset,

00:10:30.858 --> 00:10:32.286
but I think for other people,

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.333
it's because Twitter is basically
a mutual approval machine.

00:10:35.357 --> 00:10:38.276
We surround ourselves with people
who feel the same way we do,

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.563
and we approve each other,

00:10:39.587 --> 00:10:41.238
and that's a really good feeling.

00:10:41.262 --> 00:10:43.910
And if somebody gets in the way,
we screen them out.

00:10:43.934 --> 00:10:46.021
And do you know what
that's the opposite of?

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.786
It's the opposite of democracy.

00:10:48.336 --> 00:10:52.333
We wanted to show that we cared
about people dying of AIDS in Africa.

00:10:52.357 --> 00:10:56.364
Our desire to be seen to be compassionate
is what led us to commit

00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:59.433
this profoundly un-compassionate act.

00:10:59.887 --> 00:11:02.417
As Meghan O'Gieblyn wrote
in the Boston Review,

00:11:02.441 --> 00:11:06.852
"This isn't social justice.
It's a cathartic alternative."

00:11:07.686 --> 00:11:08.885
For the past three years,

00:11:08.909 --> 00:11:12.187
I've been going around the world
meeting people like Justine Sacco --

00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:14.995
and believe me, there's a lot
of people like Justine Sacco.

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:16.725
There's more every day.

00:11:16.749 --> 00:11:20.041
And we want to think they're fine,
but they're not fine.

00:11:20.065 --> 00:11:22.200
The people I met were mangled.

00:11:22.224 --> 00:11:24.065
They talked to me about depression,

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:28.005
and anxiety and insomnia
and suicidal thoughts.

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:32.768
One woman I talked to,
who also told a joke that landed badly,

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:35.006
she stayed home for a year and a half.

00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:39.869
Before that, she worked with adults
with learning difficulties,

00:11:39.893 --> 00:11:42.331
and was apparently really good at her job.

00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:47.175
Justine was fired, of course,
because social media demanded it.

00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:49.351
But it was worse than that.

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.334
She was losing herself.

00:11:51.358 --> 00:11:55.418
She was waking up in the middle
of the night, forgetting who she was.

00:11:56.079 --> 00:12:00.035
She was got because she was perceived
to have misused her privilege.

00:12:00.059 --> 00:12:03.620
And of course, that's a much better thing
to get people for than the things

00:12:03.644 --> 00:12:06.804
we used to get people for,
like having children out of wedlock.

00:12:06.828 --> 00:12:09.659
But the phrase "misuse of privilege"
is becoming a free pass

00:12:09.683 --> 00:12:13.111
to tear apart pretty much
anybody we choose to.

00:12:13.135 --> 00:12:15.441
It's becoming a devalued term,

00:12:15.465 --> 00:12:18.450
and it's making us lose
our capacity for empathy

00:12:18.474 --> 00:12:23.394
and for distinguishing between serious
and unserious transgressions.

00:12:24.334 --> 00:12:27.863
Justine had 170 Twitter followers,
and so to make it work,

00:12:27.887 --> 00:12:29.856
she had to be fictionalized.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.695
Word got around that she was the daughter
the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.

00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:38.343
[Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacco
her father is a SA mining billionaire.

00:12:38.367 --> 00:12:40.422
She's not sorry.
And neither is her father.]

00:12:40.446 --> 00:12:42.269
I thought that was true about Justine,

00:12:42.293 --> 00:12:45.631
until I met her at a bar, and I asked her
about her billionaire father,

00:12:45.655 --> 00:12:47.568
and she said, "My father sells carpets."

00:12:47.592 --> 00:12:49.749
And I think back on
the early days of Twitter,

00:12:49.773 --> 00:12:52.503
when people would admit
shameful secrets about themselves,

00:12:52.527 --> 00:12:55.453
and other people would say,
"Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."

00:12:55.477 --> 00:12:59.650
These days, the hunt is on
for people's shameful secrets.

00:12:59.674 --> 00:13:01.716
You can lead a good, ethical life,

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.174
but some bad phraseology in a Tweet
can overwhelm it all,

00:13:06.198 --> 00:13:09.182
become a clue to your secret inner evil.

00:13:09.797 --> 00:13:12.236
Maybe there's two types
of people in the world:

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.787
those people who favor
humans over ideology,

00:13:15.811 --> 00:13:18.717
and those people who favor
ideology over humans.

00:13:19.107 --> 00:13:21.755
I favor humans over ideology,

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:24.540
but right now, the ideologues are winning,

00:13:24.564 --> 00:13:29.234
and they're creating a stage
for constant artificial high dramas

00:13:29.258 --> 00:13:31.686
where everybody's either
a magnificent hero

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.318
or a sickening villain,

00:13:33.342 --> 00:13:36.359
even though we know that's not true
about our fellow humans.

00:13:36.383 --> 00:13:40.369
What's true is that
we are clever and stupid;

00:13:40.393 --> 00:13:43.579
what's true is that we're grey areas.

00:13:43.603 --> 00:13:46.481
The great thing about social media
was how it gave a voice

00:13:46.505 --> 00:13:47.901
to voiceless people,

00:13:47.925 --> 00:13:50.579
but we're now creating
a surveillance society,

00:13:50.603 --> 00:13:54.953
where the smartest way to survive
is to go back to being voiceless.

00:13:55.423 --> 00:13:56.856
Let's not do that.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.032
Thank you.

00:13:58.056 --> 00:14:03.774
(Applause)

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.895
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Jon.

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:12.165
Jon Ronson: Thanks, Bruno.

00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:13.363
BG: Don't go away.

00:14:14.939 --> 00:14:16.734
What strikes me about Justine's story

00:14:16.758 --> 00:14:19.191
is also the fact that if you
Google her name today,

00:14:19.215 --> 00:14:21.962
this story covers the first
100 pages of Google results --

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:24.198
there is nothing else about her.

00:14:24.222 --> 00:14:26.810
In your book, you mention another story

00:14:26.834 --> 00:14:31.365
of another victim who actually got
taken on by a reputation management firm,

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:36.473
and by creating blogs and posting nice,
innocuous stories about her love for cats

00:14:36.497 --> 00:14:39.213
and holidays and stuff,
managed to get the story

00:14:39.237 --> 00:14:43.160
off the first couple pages of Google
results, but it didn't last long.

00:14:43.184 --> 00:14:48.137
A couple of weeks later, they started
creeping back up to the top result.

00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:50.109
Is this a totally lost battle?

00:14:50.483 --> 00:14:53.317
Jon Ronson: You know, I think
the very best thing we can do,

00:14:53.341 --> 00:14:57.915
if you see a kind of unfair
or an ambiguous shaming,

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:01.339
is to speak up, because I think
the worst thing that happened to Justine

00:15:01.363 --> 00:15:04.379
was that nobody supported her --
like, everyone was against her,

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:06.128
and that is profoundly traumatizing,

00:15:06.152 --> 00:15:09.974
to be told by tens of thousands of people
that you need to get out.

00:15:09.998 --> 00:15:14.088
But if a shaming happens and there's
a babble of voices, like in a democracy,

00:15:14.112 --> 00:15:17.208
where people are discussing it,
I think that's much less damaging.

00:15:17.232 --> 00:15:18.859
So I think that's the way forward,

00:15:18.883 --> 00:15:21.479
but it's hard, because if you do
stand up for somebody,

00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:23.199
it's incredibly unpleasant.

00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:25.143
BG: So let's talk about your experience,

00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:27.175
because you stood up by writing this book.

00:15:27.199 --> 00:15:29.788
By the way, it's mandatory
reading for everybody, okay?

00:15:29.812 --> 00:15:34.122
You stood up because the book
actually puts the spotlight on shamers.

00:15:34.146 --> 00:15:37.178
And I assume you didn't only
have friendly reactions on Twitter.

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:39.882
JR: It didn't go down that well
with some people.

00:15:39.906 --> 00:15:40.907
(Laughter)

00:15:40.931 --> 00:15:43.035
I mean, you don't want
to just concentrate --

00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:46.456
because lots of people understood,
and were really nice about the book.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.833
But yeah, for 30 years I've been writing
stories about abuses of power,

00:15:49.857 --> 00:15:53.137
and when I say the powerful people
over there in the military,

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.929
or in the pharmaceutical industry,
everybody applauds me.

00:15:55.953 --> 00:16:00.328
As soon as I say, "We are the powerful
people abusing our power now,"

00:16:00.352 --> 00:16:03.076
I get people saying,
"Well you must be a racist too."

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.775
BG: So the other night --
yesterday -- we were at dinner,

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.714
and there were two discussions going on.

00:16:07.738 --> 00:16:10.786
On one side you were talking
with people around the table --

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.973
and that was a nice,
constructive discussion.

00:16:12.997 --> 00:16:15.344
On the other, every time
you turned to your phone,

00:16:15.368 --> 00:16:16.929
there is this deluge of insults.

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:20.344
JR: Yeah. This happened last night.
We had like a TED dinner last night.

00:16:20.368 --> 00:16:24.168
We were chatting and it was lovely
and nice, and I decided to check Twitter.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.312
Somebody said, "You are
a white supremacist."

00:16:26.336 --> 00:16:29.310
And then I went back and had
a nice conversation with somebody,

00:16:29.334 --> 00:16:30.875
and then I went back to Twitter,

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:33.987
somebody said my very existence
made the world a worse place.

00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:36.758
My friend Adam Curtis says

00:16:36.782 --> 00:16:40.590
that maybe the Internet is like
a John Carpenter movie from the 1980s,

00:16:40.614 --> 00:16:43.655
when eventually everyone
will start screaming at each other

00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:46.209
and shooting each other,
and then eventually everybody

00:16:46.233 --> 00:16:48.229
would flee to somewhere safer,

00:16:48.253 --> 00:16:52.153
and I'm starting to think of that
as a really nice option.

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.130
BG: Jon, thank you.
JR: Thank you, Bruno.

00:16:54.154 --> 00:16:58.152
(Applause)
