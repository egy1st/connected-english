00:00:02.022 --> 00:00:05.315
This back here was my brain cancer.

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:08.845
Isn't it nice?

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:11.312
(Laughter)

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:13.798
The key phrase is "was,"

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:15.457
phew.

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:20.523
(Applause)

00:00:20.547 --> 00:00:24.715
Having brain cancer was really,
as you can imagine,

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.591
shocking news for me.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:28.984
I knew nothing about cancer.

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.870
In Western cultures, when you have cancer,

00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:36.102
it's as if you disappear in a way.

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:43.123
Your life as a complex human being
is replaced by medical data:

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:49.234
Your images, your exams, your lab values,

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:50.933
a list of medicines.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.734
And everyone changes as well.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:56.795
You suddenly become a disease on legs.

00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:01.488
Doctors start speaking a language
which you don't understand.

00:01:01.983 --> 00:01:07.313
They start pointing their fingers

00:01:07.337 --> 00:01:11.484
at your body and your images.

00:01:12.187 --> 00:01:15.210
People start changing as well

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:19.076
because they start dealing
with the disease,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.435
instead of with the human being.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.620
They say, "What did the doctor say?"

00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:26.048
before even saying, "Hello."

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:29.899
And in the meanwhile,

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:35.089
you're left with questions
to which nobody gives an answer.

00:01:35.113 --> 00:01:37.864
These are the "Can I?" questions:

00:01:37.888 --> 00:01:39.883
Can I work while I have cancer?

00:01:40.507 --> 00:01:45.054
Can I study? Can I make love?
Can I be creative?

00:01:45.864 --> 00:01:49.318
And you wonder, "What have I done
to deserve this?"

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:53.476
You wonder, "Can I change something
about my lifestyle?"

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.174
You wonder, "Can I do something?

00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:58.293
Are there any other options?"

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:05.964
And, obviously, doctors are
the good guys in all these scenarios,

00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:11.910
because they are very professional
and dedicated to curing you.

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:17.168
But they also are very used
to having to deal with patients,

00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:24.124
so I'd say that they sometimes
lose the idea that this is torture for you

00:02:24.148 --> 00:02:29.079
and that you become,
literally, a patient --

00:02:29.103 --> 00:02:31.514
"patient" means "the one who waits."

00:02:31.538 --> 00:02:32.931
(Laughter)

00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:37.144
Things are changing, but classically,

00:02:37.168 --> 00:02:42.817
they tend to not engage you in any way
to learn about your condition,

00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:46.964
to get your friends and family engaged,

00:02:46.988 --> 00:02:50.728
or showing you ways
in which you can change your lifestyle

00:02:50.752 --> 00:02:53.142
to minimize the risks
of what you're going through.

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:57.947
But instead, you're forced there to wait

00:02:57.971 --> 00:03:02.992
in the hands of a series
of very professional strangers.

00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:06.890
While I was in the hospital,

00:03:06.914 --> 00:03:10.332
I asked for a printed-out
picture of my cancer

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.415
and I spoke with it.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.318
It was really hard to obtain,

00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:20.270
because it's not common practice
to ask for a picture of your own cancer.

00:03:20.294 --> 00:03:22.059
I talked to it and I said,

00:03:22.083 --> 00:03:26.611
"Okay, cancer,
you're not all there is to me.

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:28.623
There's more to me.

00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:35.062
A cure, whichever it is, will have
to deal with the whole of me."

00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:41.000
And so, the next day, I left the hospital
against medical advice.

00:03:41.024 --> 00:03:45.592
I was determined to change
my relationship with the cancer

00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:48.460
and I was determined
to learn more about my cancer

00:03:48.484 --> 00:03:52.053
before doing anything
as drastic as a surgery.

00:03:54.037 --> 00:04:00.927
I'm an artist, I use several forms
of open-source technologies

00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:03.470
and open information in my practice.

00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:09.581
So my best bet was to get it all
out there, get the information out there,

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:15.192
and use it so that it could be
accessed by anyone.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.222
So I created a website,
which is called La Cura,

00:04:20.246 --> 00:04:23.374
on which I put my medical data, online.

00:04:23.398 --> 00:04:25.271
I actually had to hack it

00:04:25.295 --> 00:04:29.451
and that's a thing which we
can talk about in another speech.

00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:30.798
(Laughter)

00:04:30.822 --> 00:04:33.379
I chose this word, La Cura --

00:04:33.403 --> 00:04:35.738
La Cura in Italian means "the cure" --

00:04:35.762 --> 00:04:38.490
because in many different cultures,

00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:42.621
the word "cure" can mean
many different things.

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:44.725
In our Western cultures,

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:49.218
it means eradicating
or reversing a disease,

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:50.746
but in different cultures,

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.326
for example, a culture from Asia,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.462
from the Mediterranean,
from Latin countries, from Africa,

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:00.209
it can mean many more things.

00:05:00.628 --> 00:05:05.991
Of course, I was interested
in the opinions of doctors

00:05:06.015 --> 00:05:08.240
and healthcare providers,

00:05:08.264 --> 00:05:14.235
but I was also interested in
the cure of the artist, of the poet,

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.412
of the designer,

00:05:16.436 --> 00:05:20.356
of, who knows, the musicians.

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.765
I was interested in the social cure,

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.463
I was interested in
the psychological cure,

00:05:26.487 --> 00:05:28.977
I was interested in the spiritual cure,

00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:32.035
I was interested in the emotional cure,

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:34.857
I was interested in any form of cure.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.592
And, it worked.

00:05:40.616 --> 00:05:43.945
The La Cura website went viral.

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:48.670
I received lots of media attention
from Italy and from abroad

00:05:48.694 --> 00:05:54.416
and I quickly received
more than 500,000 contacts --

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.354
emails, social networking --

00:05:56.378 --> 00:05:59.549
most of them were a suggestion
on how to cure my cancer,

00:05:59.573 --> 00:06:02.980
but more of them were about
how to cure myself

00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:05.319
as a full individual.

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:10.341
For example, many thousands of videos,

00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:14.295
images, pictures, art performances

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.008
were produced for La Cura.

00:06:16.756 --> 00:06:20.030
For example, here we see
Francesca Fini in her performance.

00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:25.498
Or, as artist Patrick Lichty has done:

00:06:25.522 --> 00:06:30.076
He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.797
and put it on sale on Thingiverse.

00:06:32.821 --> 00:06:35.020
Now you can have my cancer, too!

00:06:35.044 --> 00:06:37.557
(Laughter)

00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:40.974
Which is a nice thing,
if you think about it,

00:06:40.998 --> 00:06:42.782
we can share our cancer.

00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:46.609
And this was going on --

00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:49.994
scientists, the traditional
medicine experts,

00:06:50.018 --> 00:06:51.681
several researchers, doctors --

00:06:51.705 --> 00:06:54.377
all connected with me to give advice.

00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:56.296
With all this information and support,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.985
I was able to form a team
of several neurosurgeons,

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:04.971
traditional doctors,

00:07:04.995 --> 00:07:11.120
oncologists, and several
hundred volunteers

00:07:11.144 --> 00:07:14.349
with whom I was able to discuss

00:07:14.373 --> 00:07:19.772
the information I was receiving,
which is very important.

00:07:19.796 --> 00:07:26.141
And together, we were able to form
a strategy for my own cure

00:07:26.165 --> 00:07:29.792
in many languages,
according to many cultures.

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:32.981
And the current strategy
spans the whole world

00:07:33.005 --> 00:07:35.603
and thousands of years of human history,

00:07:35.627 --> 00:07:37.686
which is quite remarkable for me.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.370
[Surgery]

00:07:39.394 --> 00:07:44.323
The follow-up MRIs showed, luckily,
little to no growth of the cancer.

00:07:45.005 --> 00:07:48.402
So I was able to take my time and choose.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:52.067
I chose the doctor I wanted to work with,

00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:54.465
I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in,

00:07:54.489 --> 00:07:58.476
and in the meanwhile, I was supported
by thousands of people,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.727
none of whom felt pity for me.

00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:07.405
Everyone felt like they could
take an active role

00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:09.241
in helping me to get well,

00:08:09.265 --> 00:08:12.630
and this was the most important
part of La Cura.

00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:15.283
What are the outcomes?

00:08:16.122 --> 00:08:18.455
I'm fine, as you can see, pretty fine.

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:23.771
(Applause)

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:26.203
I had excellent news

00:08:26.227 --> 00:08:27.833
after the surgery --

00:08:27.857 --> 00:08:33.352
I have -- I had a very low-grade glioma,

00:08:33.376 --> 00:08:37.798
which is a "good" kind of cancer
which doesn't grow a lot.

00:08:37.822 --> 00:08:41.275
I have completely changed
my life and my lifestyle.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.375
Everything I did was thoughtfully
designed to get me engaged.

00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:52.171
Up until the very last few
minutes of the surgery,

00:08:52.195 --> 00:08:54.162
which was very intense,

00:08:54.186 --> 00:08:58.107
a matrix of electrodes
was implanted in my brain

00:08:58.131 --> 00:08:59.997
from this side,

00:09:00.021 --> 00:09:05.254
to be able to build a functional map
of what the brain controls.

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:08.952
And right before the operation,

00:09:08.976 --> 00:09:15.753
we were able to discuss
the functional map of my brain

00:09:15.777 --> 00:09:20.660
with the doctor, to understand
which risks I was running into

00:09:20.684 --> 00:09:24.288
and if there were any I wanted to avoid.

00:09:24.312 --> 00:09:26.428
Obviously, there were.

00:09:26.452 --> 00:09:27.505
[Open]

00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:32.956
And this openness was really
the fundamental part of La Cura.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.775
Thousands of people shared
their stories, their experiences.

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:42.403
Doctors got to talk with people
they don't usually consult

00:09:42.427 --> 00:09:47.346
when they think about cancer.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.019
I'm a self-founding,
continuous state of translation

00:09:52.043 --> 00:09:54.339
among many different languages,

00:09:54.363 --> 00:09:58.236
in which science meets emotion

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.897
and conventional research
meets traditional research.

00:10:02.921 --> 00:10:04.239
[Society]

00:10:04.263 --> 00:10:09.610
The most important thing of La Cura

00:10:09.635 --> 00:10:16.635
was to feel like a part
of a really engaged and connected society

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:22.780
whose wellness really depends
on the wellness of all of its components.

00:10:24.253 --> 00:10:28.853
This global performance
is my open-source cure for cancer.

00:10:29.873 --> 00:10:31.655
And from what I feel,

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:34.055
it's a cure for me, but for us all.

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:35.232
Thank you.

00:10:35.256 --> 00:10:37.931
(Applause).
