00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.851
This is a map of New York State

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:06.393
that was made in 1937
by the General Drafting Company.

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:09.914
It's an extremely famous map
among cartography nerds,

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:12.659
because down here at the bottom
of the Catskill Mountains,

00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:14.562
there is a little town called Roscoe --

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:17.284
actually, this will go easier
if I just put it up here --

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:20.838
There's Roscoe, and then right
above Roscoe is Rockland, New York,

00:00:20.862 --> 00:00:24.675
and then right above that
is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.758
Agloe, New York, is very famous
to cartographers,

00:00:27.782 --> 00:00:30.058
because it's a paper town.

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:32.304
It's also known as a copyright trap.

00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:35.682
Mapmakers -- because my map of New York
and your map of New York

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:39.372
are going to look very similar,
on account of the shape of New York --

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:44.169
often, mapmakers will insert
fake places onto their maps,

00:00:44.193 --> 00:00:45.955
in order to protect their copyright.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.867
Because then, if my fake place
shows up on your map,

00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:52.546
I can be well and truly sure
that you have robbed me.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.211
Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials
of the two guys who made this map,

00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:00.156
Ernest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.456
and they released this map in 1937.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.799
Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map

00:01:06.823 --> 00:01:10.847
with Agloe, New York, on it,
at the same exact intersection

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.139
of two dirt roads
in the middle of nowhere.

00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:17.466
Well, you can imagine the delight
over at General Drafting.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.702
They immediately call
Rand McNally, and they say,

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:24.320
"We've caught you!
We made Agloe, New York, up.

00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:26.398
It is a fake place. It's a paper town.

00:01:26.422 --> 00:01:28.123
We're going to sue your pants off!"

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:33.490
And Rand McNally says,
"No, no, no, no, Agloe is real."

00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:39.160
Because people kept going
to that intersection of two dirt roads --

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:40.208
(Laughter)

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:44.728
in the middle of nowhere, expecting
there to be a place called Agloe --

00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:47.985
someone built a place
called Agloe, New York.

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.048
(Laughter)

00:01:49.072 --> 00:01:52.453
It had a gas station, a general store,
two houses at its peak.

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:54.747
(Laughter)

00:01:55.596 --> 00:02:00.074
And this is of course a completely
irresistible metaphor to a novelist,

00:02:00.098 --> 00:02:04.709
because we would all like to believe
that the stuff that we write down on paper

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:07.525
can change the actual world
in which we're actually living,

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.938
which is why my third book
is called "Paper Towns".

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:14.501
But what interests me ultimately more
than the medium in which this happened,

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:16.906
is the phenomenon itself.

00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:21.598
It's easy enough to say that the world
shapes our maps of the world, right?

00:02:21.622 --> 00:02:26.049
Like the overall shape of the world
is obviously going to affect our maps.

00:02:26.503 --> 00:02:29.818
But what I find a lot more
interesting is the way

00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:33.383
that the manner in which we map
the world changes the world.

00:02:33.872 --> 00:02:38.563
Because the world would truly be
a different place if North were down.

00:02:38.587 --> 00:02:40.765
And the world would be
a truly different place

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.808
if Alaska and Russia weren't
on opposite sides of the map.

00:02:43.832 --> 00:02:45.758
And the world would be a different place

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:48.942
if we projected Europe
to show it in its actual size.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.083
The world is changed
by our maps of the world.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.265
The way that we choose -- sort of,
our personal cartographic enterprise,

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:01.924
also shapes the map of our lives,

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:04.066
and that in turn shapes our lives.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.745
I believe that what we map
changes the life we lead.

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.183
And I don't mean that in some, like,
secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like,

00:03:13.207 --> 00:03:16.177
you-can-think-your-way-
out-of-cancer sense.

00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:22.734
But I do believe that while maps don't
show you where you will go in your life,

00:03:22.758 --> 00:03:24.749
they show you where you might go.

00:03:24.773 --> 00:03:29.246
You very rarely go to a place
that isn't on your personal map.

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:32.968
So I was a really terrible student
when I was a kid.

00:03:32.992 --> 00:03:35.664
My GPA was consistently in the low 2s.

00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:39.296
And I think the reason that I was
such a terrible student

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.475
is that I felt like education
was just a series of hurdles

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.656
that had been erected before me,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.307
and I had to jump over
in order to achieve adulthood.

00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:50.815
And I didn't really want
to jump over these hurdles,

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.773
because they seemed completely
arbitrary, so I often wouldn't,

00:03:53.797 --> 00:03:55.874
and then people would
threaten me, you know,

00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:58.827
they'd threaten me with this
"going on [my] permanent record,"

00:03:58.851 --> 00:04:01.060
or "You'll never get a good job."

00:04:01.084 --> 00:04:02.563
I didn't want a good job!

00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:05.599
As far as I could tell at eleven
or twelve years old,

00:04:05.623 --> 00:04:08.775
like, people with good jobs woke up
very early in the morning,

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.804
(Laughter)

00:04:10.828 --> 00:04:15.400
and the men who had good jobs,
one of the first things they did

00:04:15.424 --> 00:04:19.347
was tie a strangulation item
of clothing around their necks.

00:04:19.924 --> 00:04:21.972
They literally put nooses on themselves,

00:04:21.996 --> 00:04:24.722
and then they went off to their jobs,
whatever they were.

00:04:25.455 --> 00:04:27.485
That's not a recipe for a happy life.

00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:31.837
These people -- in my, symbol-obsessed,
twelve year-old imagination --

00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:34.420
these people who are strangling themselves

00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:36.800
as one of the first things
they do each morning,

00:04:36.824 --> 00:04:38.584
they can't possibly be happy.

00:04:38.608 --> 00:04:41.020
Why would I want to jump
over all of these hurdles

00:04:41.044 --> 00:04:43.044
and have that be the end?

00:04:43.068 --> 00:04:44.235
That's a terrible end!

00:04:45.454 --> 00:04:48.632
And then, when I was in tenth grade,
I went to this school,

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:51.418
Indian Springs School,
a small boarding school,

00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:53.252
outside of Birmingham, Alabama.

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:56.791
And all at once I became a learner.

00:04:56.815 --> 00:04:59.011
And I became a learner,
because I found myself

00:04:59.035 --> 00:05:01.059
in a community of learners.

00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:02.846
I found myself surrounded by people

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.100
who celebrated intellectualism
and engagement,

00:05:06.124 --> 00:05:10.297
and who thought that my ironic
oh-so-cool disengagement

00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:12.175
wasn't clever, or funny,

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.961
but, like, it was a simple
and unspectacular response

00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:18.259
to very complicated
and compelling problems.

00:05:18.692 --> 00:05:21.185
And so I started to learn,
because learning was cool.

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:24.512
I learned that some infinite sets
are bigger than other infinite sets,

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:28.630
and I learned that iambic pentameter is
and why it sounds so good to human ears.

00:05:28.654 --> 00:05:32.096
I learned that the Civil War
was a nationalizing conflict,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.287
I learned some physics,

00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:36.467
I learned that correlation shouldn't be
confused with causation --

00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:38.284
all of these things, by the way,

00:05:38.308 --> 00:05:42.560
enriched my life
on a literally daily basis.

00:05:42.584 --> 00:05:46.170
And it's true that I don't use
most of them for my "job,"

00:05:46.194 --> 00:05:48.108
but that's not what it's about for me.

00:05:48.132 --> 00:05:50.083
It's about cartography.

00:05:50.107 --> 00:05:52.368
What is the process of cartography?

00:05:52.392 --> 00:05:55.553
It's, you know, sailing
upon some land, and thinking,

00:05:55.577 --> 00:05:57.678
"I think I'll draw that bit of land,"

00:05:57.702 --> 00:06:01.025
and then wondering, "Maybe there's
some more land to draw."

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:03.256
And that's when learning
really began for me.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.916
It's true that I had teachers
that didn't give up on me,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.258
and I was very fortunate
to have those teachers,

00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:12.456
because I often gave them cause to think
there was no reason to invest in me.

00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:16.030
But a lot of the learning
that I did in high school

00:06:16.054 --> 00:06:19.233
wasn't about what happened
inside the classroom,

00:06:19.257 --> 00:06:21.715
it was about what happened
outside of the classroom.

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:23.096
For instance, I can tell you

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.953
that "There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons --

00:06:25.977 --> 00:06:28.430
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes --"

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:31.770
not because I memorized
Emily Dickinson in school

00:06:31.794 --> 00:06:33.070
when I was in high school,

00:06:33.094 --> 00:06:35.689
but because there was a girl
when I was in high school,

00:06:35.713 --> 00:06:38.200
and her name was Amanda,
and I had a crush on her,

00:06:38.224 --> 00:06:40.598
and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry.

00:06:40.622 --> 00:06:43.306
The reason I can tell you
what opportunity cost is,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.982
is because one day when I was playing
Super Mario Kart on my couch,

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.878
my friend Emmet walked in, and he said,

00:06:48.902 --> 00:06:51.260
"How long have you been playing
Super Mario Kart?"

00:06:51.284 --> 00:06:54.754
And I said, "I don't know,
like, six hours?" and he said,

00:06:54.778 --> 00:06:58.146
"Do you realize that if you'd worked
at Baskin-Robbins those six hours,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.428
you could have made 30 dollars,
so in some ways,

00:07:00.452 --> 00:07:03.372
you just paid thirty dollars
to play Super Mario Kart."

00:07:03.396 --> 00:07:05.654
And I was, like, "I'll take that deal."

00:07:05.678 --> 00:07:08.027
(Laughter)

00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:11.976
But I learned what opportunity cost is.

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:16.761
And along the way, the map
of my life got better.

00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:19.642
It got bigger; it contained more places.

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:21.631
There were more things that might happen,

00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:23.614
more futures I might have.

00:07:24.662 --> 00:07:27.949
It wasn't a formal, organized
learning process,

00:07:27.973 --> 00:07:29.704
and I'm happy to admit that.

00:07:29.728 --> 00:07:32.860
It was spotty, it was inconsistent,
there was a lot I didn't know.

00:07:32.884 --> 00:07:35.178
I might know, you know, Cantor's idea

00:07:35.202 --> 00:07:38.035
that some infinite sets are larger
than other infinite sets,

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:40.956
but I didn't really understand
the calculus behind that idea.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.995
I might know the idea of opportunity cost,

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:45.329
but I didn't know the law
of diminishing returns.

00:07:45.353 --> 00:07:48.326
But the great thing about imagining
learning as cartography,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.438
instead of imagining it
as arbitrary hurdles

00:07:50.462 --> 00:07:51.820
that you have to jump over,

00:07:51.844 --> 00:07:55.316
is that you see a bit of coastline,
and that makes you want to see more.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.777
And so now I do know
at least some of the calculus

00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:59.533
that underlies all of that stuff.

00:07:59.557 --> 00:08:01.327
So, I had one learning community

00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:03.965
in high school, then I went
to another for college,

00:08:03.989 --> 00:08:05.289
and then I went to another,

00:08:05.313 --> 00:08:07.909
when I started working
at a magazine called "Booklist,"

00:08:07.933 --> 00:08:11.286
where I was an assistant, surrounded
by astonishingly well-read people.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.836
And then I wrote a book.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.060
And like all authors dream of doing,

00:08:15.084 --> 00:08:17.013
I promptly quit my job.

00:08:17.037 --> 00:08:18.626
(Laughter)

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.626
And for the first time since high school,

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.253
I found myself without a learning
community, and it was miserable.

00:08:25.277 --> 00:08:26.711
I hated it.

00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:30.109
I read many, many books
during this two-year period.

00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:31.896
I read books about Stalin,

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.411
and books about how the Uzbek people
came to identify as Muslims,

00:08:35.435 --> 00:08:37.785
and I read books about
how to make atomic bombs,

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.958
but it just felt like I was
creating my own hurdles,

00:08:40.982 --> 00:08:44.338
and then jumping over them myself,
instead of feeling the excitement

00:08:44.362 --> 00:08:48.011
of being part of a community of learners,
a community of people

00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:51.018
who are engaged together
in the cartographic enterprise

00:08:51.042 --> 00:08:54.598
of trying to better understand
and map the world around us.

00:08:54.979 --> 00:08:58.068
And then, in 2006, I met that guy.

00:08:58.092 --> 00:08:59.243
His name is Ze Frank.

00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:01.904
I didn't actually meet him,
just on the Internet.

00:09:02.455 --> 00:09:07.458
Ze Frank was running, at the time,
a show called "The Show with Ze Frank,"

00:09:07.482 --> 00:09:08.956
and I discovered the show,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.214
and that was my way back
into being a community learner again.

00:09:12.238 --> 00:09:14.393
Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas:

00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:19.342
(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built
in the middle of a huge, hot desert.

00:09:19.366 --> 00:09:22.062
Almost everything here was brought
from somewhere else --

00:09:22.086 --> 00:09:24.262
the sort of rocks, the trees,
the waterfalls.

00:09:24.286 --> 00:09:27.295
These fish are almost as out of place
as my pig that flew.

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:30.185
Contrasted to the scorching desert
that surrounds this place,

00:09:30.209 --> 00:09:31.363
so are these people.

00:09:31.387 --> 00:09:35.318
Things from all over the world have been
rebuilt here, away from their histories,

00:09:35.342 --> 00:09:38.090
and away from the people
that experience them differently.

00:09:38.114 --> 00:09:41.294
Sometimes improvements were made --
even the Sphinx got a nose job.

00:09:41.318 --> 00:09:44.209
Here, there's no reason to feel
like you're missing anything.

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:47.203
This New York means the same to me
as it does to everyone else.

00:09:47.227 --> 00:09:50.784
Everything is out of context, and that
means context allows for everything:

00:09:50.808 --> 00:09:52.738
Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.

00:09:52.762 --> 00:09:56.360
This fabrication of place could be one
of the world's greatest achievements,

00:09:56.384 --> 00:09:58.405
because no one belongs here;
everyone does.

00:09:58.429 --> 00:10:01.453
As I walked around this morning,
I noticed most of the buildings

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:04.217
were huge mirrors reflecting
the sun back into the desert.

00:10:04.241 --> 00:10:05.402
But unlike most mirrors,

00:10:05.426 --> 00:10:08.801
which present you with an outside view
of yourself embedded in a place,

00:10:08.825 --> 00:10:10.270
these mirrors come back empty.

00:10:10.294 --> 00:10:12.473
John Green: Makes me
nostalgic for the days

00:10:12.497 --> 00:10:14.679
when you could see
the pixels in online video.

00:10:14.703 --> 00:10:15.710
(Laughter)

00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:19.820
Ze isn't just a great public intellectual,
he's also a brilliant community builder,

00:10:19.844 --> 00:10:22.705
and the community of people
that built up around these videos

00:10:22.729 --> 00:10:24.741
was in many ways a community of learners.

00:10:24.765 --> 00:10:28.289
So we played Ze Frank at chess
collaboratively, and we beat him.

00:10:28.313 --> 00:10:32.726
We organized ourselves to take a young man
on a road trip across the United States.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.701
We turned the Earth into a sandwich,

00:10:34.725 --> 00:10:38.434
by having one person hold a piece of bread
at one point on the Earth,

00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:40.587
and on the exact opposite
point of the Earth,

00:10:40.611 --> 00:10:43.123
have another person
holding a piece of bread.

00:10:43.593 --> 00:10:49.601
I realize that these are silly ideas,
but they are also "learny" ideas,

00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:51.547
and that was what was so exciting to me,

00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:55.161
and if you go online, you can find
communities like this all over the place.

00:10:55.185 --> 00:10:57.066
Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr,

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.741
and yes, you will see people
complaining about calculus,

00:10:59.765 --> 00:11:02.435
but you'll also see people
re-blogging those complaints,

00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:05.643
making the argument that calculus
is interesting and beautiful,

00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:09.620
and here's a way in to thinking about
the problem that you find unsolvable.

00:11:09.644 --> 00:11:12.240
You can go to places like Reddit,
and find sub-Reddits,

00:11:12.264 --> 00:11:14.882
like "Ask a Historian" or "Ask Science,"

00:11:14.906 --> 00:11:18.137
where you can ask people
who are in these fields

00:11:18.161 --> 00:11:19.629
a wide range of questions,

00:11:19.653 --> 00:11:21.994
from very serious ones to very silly ones.

00:11:22.018 --> 00:11:24.950
But to me, the most interesting
communities of learners

00:11:24.974 --> 00:11:27.837
that are growing up on the Internet
right now are on YouTube,

00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:29.457
and admittedly, I am biased.

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:34.015
But I think in a lot of ways,
the YouTube page resembles a classroom.

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:35.863
Look for instance at "Minute Physics,"

00:11:35.887 --> 00:11:38.680
a guy who's teaching
the world about physics:

00:11:38.704 --> 00:11:40.205
(Video) Let's cut to the chase.

00:11:40.229 --> 00:11:43.587
As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson
is the last fundamental piece

00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:47.091
of the standard model of particle physics
to be discovered experimentally.

00:11:47.115 --> 00:11:49.169
But, you might ask,
why was the Higgs boson

00:11:49.193 --> 00:11:50.679
included in the standard model,

00:11:50.703 --> 00:11:53.973
alongside well-known particles
like electrons and photons and quarks,

00:11:53.997 --> 00:11:56.517
if it hadn't been discovered
back then in the 1970s?

00:11:56.541 --> 00:11:58.541
Good question. There are two main reasons.

00:11:58.565 --> 00:12:01.824
First, just like the electron
is an excitation in the electron field,

00:12:01.848 --> 00:12:04.642
the Higgs boson is simply a particle
which is an excitation

00:12:04.666 --> 00:12:06.649
of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.

00:12:06.673 --> 00:12:08.917
The Higgs field in turn
plays an integral role

00:12:08.941 --> 00:12:10.870
in our model for the weak nuclear force.

00:12:10.894 --> 00:12:14.054
In particular, the Higgs field
helps explain why it's so weak.

00:12:14.078 --> 00:12:16.142
We'll talk more about this
in a later video,

00:12:16.166 --> 00:12:20.000
but even though weak nuclear theory was
confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations,

00:12:20.024 --> 00:12:23.736
the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled
with the weak force, that until now

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.927
we've been unable to confirm
its actual and independent existence.

00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:28.726
JG: Or here's a video that I made

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.959
as part of my show "Crash Course,"
talking about World War I:

00:12:31.983 --> 00:12:35.354
(Video) The immediate cause was
of course the assassination in Sarajevo

00:12:35.378 --> 00:12:37.389
of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

00:12:37.413 --> 00:12:41.839
on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb
nationalist named Gavrilo Princip.

00:12:41.863 --> 00:12:43.305
Quick aside: It's worth noting

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:45.821
that the first big war
of the twentieth century began

00:12:45.845 --> 00:12:47.066
with an act of terrorism.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.421
So Franz Ferdinand
wasn't particularly well-liked

00:12:49.445 --> 00:12:53.079
by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph --
now that is a mustache!

00:12:53.103 --> 00:12:56.878
But even so, the assassination led Austria
to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,

00:12:56.902 --> 00:13:00.114
whereupon Serbia accepted some,
but not all, of Austria's demands,

00:13:00.138 --> 00:13:02.698
leading Austria to declare
war against Serbia.

00:13:02.722 --> 00:13:06.103
And then Russia, due to its alliance
with the Serbs, mobilized its army.

00:13:06.127 --> 00:13:08.437
Germany, because it had
an alliance with Austria,

00:13:08.461 --> 00:13:09.958
told Russia to stop mobilizing,

00:13:09.982 --> 00:13:13.241
which Russia failed to do, so then Germany
mobilized its own army,

00:13:13.265 --> 00:13:16.334
declared war on Russia,
cemented an alliance with the Ottomans,

00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:19.937
and then declared war on France,
because, you know, France.

00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:23.414
(Laughter)

00:13:23.438 --> 00:13:25.682
And it's not just physics
and world history

00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:28.838
that people are choosing
to learn through YouTube.

00:13:28.862 --> 00:13:31.240
Here's a video about abstract mathematics.

00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:36.598
(Video) So you're me, and you're
in math class yet again,

00:13:36.622 --> 00:13:38.624
because they make you go every single day.

00:13:38.648 --> 00:13:41.915
And you're learning about, I don't know,
the sums of infinite series.

00:13:41.939 --> 00:13:43.565
That's a high school topic, right?

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:47.505
Which is odd, because it's a cool topic,
but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:50.687
So I guess that's why they allow
infinite series in the curriculum.

00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:53.863
So, in a quite understandable need
for distraction, you're doodling

00:13:53.887 --> 00:13:56.819
and thinking more about what
the plural of "series" should be

00:13:56.843 --> 00:14:00.485
than about the topic at hand: "serieses,"
"seriese," "seriesen," and "serii?"

00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:03.808
Or is it that the singular should be
changed: one "serie," or "serum,"

00:14:03.832 --> 00:14:06.276
just like the singular of "sheep"
should be "shoop."

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.793
But the whole concept of things

00:14:07.817 --> 00:14:11.278
like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on
approaches one, is useful if, say,

00:14:11.302 --> 00:14:13.065
you want to draw a line of elephants,

00:14:13.089 --> 00:14:14.905
each holding the tail of the next one:

00:14:14.929 --> 00:14:18.097
normal elephant, young elephant,
baby elephant, dog-sized elephant,

00:14:18.121 --> 00:14:21.092
puppy-sized elephant, all the way
down to Mr. Tusks and beyond.

00:14:21.116 --> 00:14:22.897
Which is at least a tiny bit awesome,

00:14:22.921 --> 00:14:25.868
because you can get an infinite number
of elephants in a line,

00:14:25.892 --> 00:14:28.345
and still have it fit across
a single notebook page.

00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:30.991
JG: And lastly, here's Destin,
from "Smarter Every Day,"

00:14:31.015 --> 00:14:33.424
talking about the conservation
of angular momentum,

00:14:33.448 --> 00:14:34.925
and, since it's YouTube, cats:

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:38.060
(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin.
Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day."

00:14:38.084 --> 00:14:41.426
So you've probably observed that cats
almost always land on their feet.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.410
Today's question is: why?

00:14:43.434 --> 00:14:46.190
Like most simple questions,
there's a very complex answer.

00:14:46.214 --> 00:14:48.224
For instance, let me reword this question:

00:14:48.248 --> 00:14:53.443
How does a cat go from feet-up
to feet-down in a falling reference frame,

00:14:53.467 --> 00:14:56.432
without violating the conservation
of angular momentum?

00:14:56.456 --> 00:14:57.467
(Laughter)

00:14:57.491 --> 00:15:00.968
JG: So, here's something all four
of these videos have in common:

00:15:01.397 --> 00:15:04.516
They all have more than half
a million views on YouTube.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.609
And those are people watching
not in classrooms,

00:15:07.633 --> 00:15:11.274
but because they are part
of the communities of learning

00:15:11.298 --> 00:15:13.313
that are being set up by these channels.

00:15:13.686 --> 00:15:16.417
And I said earlier that YouTube
is like a classroom to me,

00:15:16.441 --> 00:15:19.124
and in many ways it is,
because here is the instructor --

00:15:19.148 --> 00:15:22.166
it's like the old-fashioned classroom:
here's the instructor,

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.513
and then beneath the instructor
are the students,

00:15:24.537 --> 00:15:26.608
and they're all having a conversation.

00:15:26.632 --> 00:15:30.661
And I know that YouTube comments
have a very bad reputation

00:15:30.685 --> 00:15:32.080
in the world of the Internet,

00:15:32.104 --> 00:15:35.175
but in fact, if you go on comments
for these channels,

00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:38.354
what you'll find is people engaging
the subject matter,

00:15:38.378 --> 00:15:42.625
asking difficult, complicated questions
that are about the subject matter,

00:15:42.649 --> 00:15:45.387
and then other people
answering those questions.

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:50.245
And because the YouTube page is set up so
that the page in which I'm talking to you

00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:54.112
is on the exact -- the place where I'm
talking to you is on the exact same page

00:15:54.136 --> 00:15:55.294
as your comments,

00:15:55.318 --> 00:16:00.950
you are participating in a live and real
and active way in the conversation.

00:16:00.974 --> 00:16:04.545
And because I'm in comments usually,
I get to participate with you.

00:16:04.569 --> 00:16:07.023
And you find this
whether it's world history,

00:16:07.047 --> 00:16:10.109
or mathematics, or science,
or whatever it is.

00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:15.751
You also see young people using the tools
and the sort of genres of the Internet

00:16:15.775 --> 00:16:18.852
in order to create places
for intellectual engagement,

00:16:18.876 --> 00:16:20.476
instead of the ironic detachment

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:25.197
that maybe most of us associate with memes
and other Internet conventions --

00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:27.745
you know, "Got bored. Invented calculus."

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:31.220
Or, here's Honey Boo Boo
criticizing industrial capitalism:

00:16:31.244 --> 00:16:33.910
["Liberal capitalism is not at all
the Good of humanity.

00:16:33.934 --> 00:16:37.493
Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle
of savage, destructive nihilism."]

00:16:37.517 --> 00:16:39.801
In case you can't see
what she says ... yeah.

00:16:40.325 --> 00:16:43.982
I really believe that these spaces,

00:16:44.006 --> 00:16:49.039
these communities, have become
for a new generation of learners,

00:16:49.063 --> 00:16:53.428
the kind of communities,
the kind of cartographic communities

00:16:53.452 --> 00:16:57.995
that I had when I was in high school,
and then again when I was in college.

00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:01.288
And as an adult, re-finding
these communities

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.622
has re-introduced me
to a community of learners,

00:17:04.646 --> 00:17:09.544
and has encouraged me to continue
to be a learner even in my adulthood,

00:17:09.568 --> 00:17:14.279
so that I no longer feel like learning
is something reserved for the young.

00:17:14.303 --> 00:17:16.526
Vi Hart and "Minute Physics" introduced me

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.350
to all kinds of things
that I didn't know before.

00:17:19.754 --> 00:17:21.433
And I know that we all hearken back

00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:24.543
to the days of the Parisian salon
in the Enlightenment,

00:17:24.567 --> 00:17:26.596
or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish,

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.745
"Oh, I wish I could have been
a part of that,

00:17:28.769 --> 00:17:31.614
I wish I could have laughed
at Dorothy Parker's jokes."

00:17:31.638 --> 00:17:36.416
But I'm here to tell you that these places
exist, they still exist.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.969
They exist in corners of the Internet,
where old men fear to tread.

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:41.996
(Laughter)

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:48.845
And I truly, truly believe that when
we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s,

00:17:48.869 --> 00:17:52.667
when we made Agloe real,
we were just getting started.

00:17:53.246 --> 00:17:54.398
Thank you.

00:17:54.422 --> 00:17:57.003
(Applause)
