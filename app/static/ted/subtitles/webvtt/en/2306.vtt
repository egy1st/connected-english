00:00:01.275 --> 00:00:05.898
There's this quote by activist and punk
rock musician Jello Biafra that I love.

00:00:06.848 --> 00:00:09.840
He says, "Don't hate the media.
Be the media."

00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:12.856
I'm an artist.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.754
I like working with media and technology
because A, I'm familiar with them

00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:19.540
and I like the power they hold.

00:00:19.564 --> 00:00:23.416
And B, I hate them and I'm terrified
of the power they hold.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.440
(Laughter)

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:30.901
I remember watching, in 2003, an interview
between Fox News host Tony Snow

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:34.283
and then-US Defense Secretary,
Donald Rumsfeld.

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:38.114
They were talking
about the recent invasion of Iraq,

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:41.068
and Rumsfeld is asked the question,

00:00:41.092 --> 00:00:43.013
"Well, we're hear about our body counts,

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:45.777
but we never hear about theirs, why?"

00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:49.519
And Rumsfeld's answer is,

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.770
"Well, we don't do body counts
on other people."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.150
Right?

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.643
It's estimated that between 150,000
to one million Iraqis, civilians,

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:06.203
have died as a result
of the US-led invasion in 2003.

00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:13.697
That number is in stark contrast with
the 4,486 US service members who died

00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:15.293
during that same window of time.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.874
I wanted to do more than just bring
awareness to this terrifying number.

00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:23.779
I wanted to create a monument
for the individual civilians

00:01:23.803 --> 00:01:25.707
who died as a result of the invasion.

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:30.904
Monuments to war,
such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial,

00:01:30.928 --> 00:01:32.729
are often enormous in scale.

00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:35.626
Very powerful and very one-sided.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.753
I wanted my monument to live
in the world, and to circulate.

00:01:42.642 --> 00:01:45.413
I remember when I was a boy in school,

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:49.358
my teacher assigned us
this classic civics assignment

00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:53.545
where you take a sheet of paper
and you write a member of your government.

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:56.594
And we were told,
if we wrote a really good letter,

00:01:56.618 --> 00:01:58.092
if we really thought about it,

00:01:58.116 --> 00:02:01.381
we would get back more than just
a simple formed letter as a reply.

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:05.560
This is my "Notepad."

00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:10.332
What looks like an everyday,
yellow legal tablet of paper

00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:13.959
is actually a monument
to the individual Iraqi civilians

00:02:13.983 --> 00:02:16.228
that died as a result of the US invasion.

00:02:18.726 --> 00:02:22.338
"Notepad" is an act of protest
and an act of commemoration

00:02:22.362 --> 00:02:25.011
disguised as an everyday tablet of paper.

00:02:26.522 --> 00:02:30.340
The lines of the paper, when magnified,

00:02:30.364 --> 00:02:32.324
are revealed to be micro-printed text

00:02:32.348 --> 00:02:37.094
that contains the details, the names,
the dates and locations

00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:39.840
of individual Iraqi civilians that died.

00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:46.348
So, for the last 5 years, I've been taking
pads of this paper, tons of this stuff,

00:02:46.372 --> 00:02:49.816
and smuggling it
into the stationery supplies

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.531
of the United States
and the Coalition governments.

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:53.642
(Laughter)

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:58.631
(Applause)

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:06.086
I don't have to tell you guys this is not
the place to discuss how I did that.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.102
(Laughter)

00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:14.062
But also, I've been meeting one-on-one
with members and former members

00:03:14.086 --> 00:03:18.579
of the so-called Coalition of the Willing,
who assisted in the invasion.

00:03:19.441 --> 00:03:21.727
And so, whenever I can,
I meet with one of them,

00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:23.608
and I share the project with them.

00:03:23.632 --> 00:03:25.654
And last summer, I had the chance to meet

00:03:25.678 --> 00:03:31.304
with former United States Attorney General
and Torture Memo author, Alberto Gonzales.

00:03:32.644 --> 00:03:34.812
(Video) Matt Kenyon:
May I give this to you?

00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:36.478
This is a special legal tablet.

00:03:36.502 --> 00:03:39.935
It's actually part
of an ongoing art project.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.112
Alberto Gonzalez:
This is a special legal pad?

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:43.614
MK: Yes. You won't believe me,

00:03:43.638 --> 00:03:47.439
but it's in the collection of the Museum
of Modern Art; I'm an artist.

00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:50.394
MK: And all of the lines
of the paper are actually --

00:03:50.418 --> 00:03:51.958
AG: Are they going to disappear?

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:54.229
MK: No, they're micro-printed text

00:03:54.253 --> 00:03:58.205
that contains the names
of individual Iraqi civilians

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.740
who have died since the invasion of Iraq.

00:04:01.764 --> 00:04:04.484
AG: Yeah. OK.

00:04:04.508 --> 00:04:06.081
AG: Thank you. MK: Thank you.

00:04:06.105 --> 00:04:07.776
(Laughter)

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:11.115
The way he says "thank you"
really creeps me out.

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.289
(Laughter)

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.500
OK, so I'd like each of you
to look under your chairs.

00:04:16.524 --> 00:04:17.674
There's an envelope.

00:04:20.943 --> 00:04:22.785
And please open it.

00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:29.023
The paper you're holding in your hand

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:34.086
contains the details of Iraqi civilians
that died as result of the invasion.

00:04:38.115 --> 00:04:42.291
I'd like you to use this paper
and write a member of government.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:46.157
You can help to smuggle
this civilian body count

00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:48.164
into government archives.

00:04:49.084 --> 00:04:52.505
Because every letter
that's sent in to the government,

00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:55.451
and this is all across
the world, of course --

00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:59.790
every letter that is sent in
is archived, filed and recorded.

00:05:01.183 --> 00:05:06.686
Together, we can put this in the mailboxes
and under the noses of people in power.

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:09.089
Everything that's sent in

00:05:09.113 --> 00:05:15.124
eventually becomes part of the permanent
archive of our government,

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.989
our shared historical record.

00:05:18.102 --> 00:05:19.253
Thank you.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:22.427
(Applause)

00:05:30.015 --> 00:05:31.975
Tom Rielly: So, tell me Matt,

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:36.815
how did this idea
come into your head, of "Notepad"?

00:05:37.954 --> 00:05:39.936
Matt Kenyon: I'd just finished a project

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.969
that dealt with
the US Coalition side of the war

00:05:43.993 --> 00:05:48.331
and it was a black armband that was called
the "Improvised Empathetic Device"

00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:51.234
which accumulated, in real time,

00:05:51.258 --> 00:05:54.981
the names, ranks,
cause of death and location

00:05:55.005 --> 00:05:57.787
of US service members
who had died overseas,

00:05:57.811 --> 00:06:01.753
and each time the Department of Defense
or CENTCOM released their data,

00:06:01.777 --> 00:06:03.481
it would stab me in the arm.

00:06:03.817 --> 00:06:06.650
And so, I became aware
that there was a spectacle

00:06:06.674 --> 00:06:09.566
associated with our own people
who were dying overseas,

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.253
but a disproportionate
amount of casualties

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:14.238
were the civilian casualties.

00:06:14.262 --> 00:06:15.413
TR: Thank you so much.

00:06:15.437 --> 00:06:16.604
MK: Thank you.

00:06:16.628 --> 00:06:17.909
(Applause)
