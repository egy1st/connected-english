00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:06.374
Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors
were insignificant animals.

00:00:06.398 --> 00:00:10.497
The most important thing to know
about prehistoric humans

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:12.473
is that they were unimportant.

00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:17.631
Their impact on the world was not
much greater than that of jellyfish

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:20.016
or fireflies or woodpeckers.

00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:24.226
Today, in contrast,
we control this planet.

00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:26.195
And the question is:

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:29.341
How did we come from there to here?

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:33.318
How did we turn ourselves
from insignificant apes,

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:36.489
minding their own business
in a corner of Africa,

00:00:36.513 --> 00:00:39.003
into the rulers of planet Earth?

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:45.566
Usually, we look for the difference
between us and all the other animals

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.071
on the individual level.

00:00:47.412 --> 00:00:50.406
We want to believe -- I want to believe --

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.978
that there is something special about me,

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:57.128
about my body, about my brain,

00:00:57.152 --> 00:01:02.435
that makes me so superior
to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee.

00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:06.482
But the truth is that,
on the individual level,

00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:09.537
I'm embarrassingly similar
to a chimpanzee.

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:15.264
And if you take me and a chimpanzee
and put us together on some lonely island,

00:01:15.288 --> 00:01:19.536
and we had to struggle for survival
to see who survives better,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.776
I would definitely place my bet
on the chimpanzee, not on myself.

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:28.445
And this is not something
wrong with me personally.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.595
I guess if they took almost any one
of you, and placed you alone

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.584
with a chimpanzee on some island,

00:01:34.608 --> 00:01:37.075
the chimpanzee would do much better.

00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:43.008
The real difference between humans
and all other animals

00:01:43.032 --> 00:01:45.479
is not on the individual level;

00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:47.105
it's on the collective level.

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:52.324
Humans control the planet
because they are the only animals

00:01:52.348 --> 00:01:57.525
that can cooperate both flexibly
and in very large numbers.

00:01:58.167 --> 00:01:59.935
Now, there are other animals --

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.130
like the social insects,
the bees, the ants --

00:02:03.154 --> 00:02:07.726
that can cooperate in large numbers,
but they don't do so flexibly.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.536
Their cooperation is very rigid.

00:02:11.012 --> 00:02:15.191
There is basically just one way
in which a beehive can function.

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:19.026
And if there's a new opportunity
or a new danger,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.593
the bees cannot reinvent
the social system overnight.

00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:26.497
They cannot, for example,
execute the queen

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.427
and establish a republic of bees,

00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:31.553
or a communist dictatorship
of worker bees.

00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:34.785
Other animals, like the social mammals --

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:38.683
the wolves, the elephants,
the dolphins, the chimpanzees --

00:02:38.707 --> 00:02:41.453
they can cooperate much more flexibly,

00:02:41.477 --> 00:02:44.818
but they do so only in small numbers,

00:02:44.842 --> 00:02:47.715
because cooperation among chimpanzees

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.787
is based on intimate knowledge,
one of the other.

00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:54.579
I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee,

00:02:54.603 --> 00:02:56.406
and I want to cooperate with you.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.025
I need to know you personally.

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.819
What kind of chimpanzee are you?

00:03:00.843 --> 00:03:02.256
Are you a nice chimpanzee?

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.933
Are you an evil chimpanzee?

00:03:03.957 --> 00:03:05.401
Are you trustworthy?

00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:08.478
If I don't know you, how can I
cooperate with you?

00:03:09.676 --> 00:03:13.427
The only animal that can combine
the two abilities together

00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:18.747
and cooperate both flexibly
and still do so in very large numbers

00:03:18.771 --> 00:03:20.401
is us, Homo sapiens.

00:03:20.973 --> 00:03:25.104
One versus one, or even 10 versus 10,

00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:27.697
chimpanzees might be better than us.

00:03:28.112 --> 00:03:33.291
But, if you pit 1,000 humans
against 1,000 chimpanzees,

00:03:33.315 --> 00:03:36.933
the humans will win easily,
for the simple reason

00:03:36.957 --> 00:03:40.690
that a thousand chimpanzees
cannot cooperate at all.

00:03:41.337 --> 00:03:45.388
And if you now try to cram
100,000 chimpanzees

00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:49.028
into Oxford Street,
or into Wembley Stadium,

00:03:49.052 --> 00:03:51.584
or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,

00:03:51.608 --> 00:03:54.225
you will get chaos, complete chaos.

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:58.108
Just imagine Wembley Stadium
with 100,000 chimpanzees.

00:03:58.616 --> 00:03:59.806
Complete madness.

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:06.161
In contrast, humans normally
gather there in tens of thousands,

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:09.249
and what we get is not chaos, usually.

00:04:09.273 --> 00:04:15.360
What we get is extremely sophisticated
and effective networks of cooperation.

00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:21.144
All the huge achievements
of humankind throughout history,

00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:24.451
whether it's building the pyramids
or flying to the moon,

00:04:24.475 --> 00:04:27.050
have been based not
on individual abilities,

00:04:27.074 --> 00:04:30.899
but on this ability to cooperate
flexibly in large numbers.

00:04:31.465 --> 00:04:35.122
Think even about this very talk
that I'm giving now:

00:04:35.146 --> 00:04:41.130
I'm standing here in front of an audience
of about 300 or 400 people,

00:04:41.154 --> 00:04:44.278
most of you are complete strangers to me.

00:04:44.928 --> 00:04:49.912
Similarly, I don't really know
all the people who have organized

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:51.563
and worked on this event.

00:04:51.994 --> 00:04:55.787
I don't know the pilot
and the crew members of the plane

00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:58.722
that brought me over here,
yesterday, to London.

00:04:59.286 --> 00:05:03.009
I don't know the people
who invented and manufactured

00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:07.543
this microphone and these cameras,
which are recording what I'm saying.

00:05:08.123 --> 00:05:11.660
I don't know the people
who wrote all the books and articles

00:05:11.684 --> 00:05:14.077
that I read in preparation for this talk.

00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:17.305
And I certainly don't know all the people

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:20.548
who might be watching this talk
over the Internet,

00:05:20.572 --> 00:05:23.599
somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.

00:05:24.162 --> 00:05:27.671
Nevertheless, even though
we don't know each other,

00:05:27.695 --> 00:05:33.548
we can work together to create
this global exchange of ideas.

00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:37.132
This is something chimpanzees cannot do.

00:05:37.156 --> 00:05:38.970
They communicate, of course,

00:05:38.994 --> 00:05:44.793
but you will never catch a chimpanzee
traveling to some distant chimpanzee band

00:05:44.817 --> 00:05:48.937
to give them a talk about bananas
or about elephants,

00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:51.969
or anything else that might
interest chimpanzees.

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.879
Now cooperation is, of course,
not always nice;

00:05:56.903 --> 00:06:00.928
all the horrible things humans
have been doing throughout history --

00:06:00.952 --> 00:06:03.691
and we have been doing
some very horrible things --

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:08.864
all those things are also based
on large-scale cooperation.

00:06:08.888 --> 00:06:11.484
Prisons are a system of cooperation;

00:06:11.508 --> 00:06:14.498
slaughterhouses are a system
of cooperation;

00:06:14.522 --> 00:06:17.526
concentration camps
are a system of cooperation.

00:06:17.907 --> 00:06:23.087
Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses
and prisons and concentration camps.

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:28.013
Now suppose I've managed
to convince you perhaps that yes,

00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:33.095
we control the world because we can
cooperate flexibly in large numbers.

00:06:33.516 --> 00:06:36.464
The next question that immediately arises

00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:39.371
in the mind of an inquisitive listener is:

00:06:39.395 --> 00:06:41.679
How, exactly, do we do it?

00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:47.865
What enables us alone, of all the animals,
to cooperate in such a way?

00:06:49.714 --> 00:06:52.260
The answer is our imagination.

00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:58.430
We can cooperate flexibly
with countless numbers of strangers,

00:06:58.454 --> 00:07:02.150
because we alone, of all
the animals on the planet,

00:07:02.174 --> 00:07:06.797
can create and believe fictions,
fictional stories.

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:11.914
And as long as everybody believes
in the same fiction,

00:07:11.938 --> 00:07:15.480
everybody obeys and follows
the same rules,

00:07:15.504 --> 00:07:17.793
the same norms, the same values.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:22.538
All other animals use
their communication system

00:07:22.562 --> 00:07:25.058
only to describe reality.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.807
A chimpanzee may say, "Look!
There's a lion, let's run away!"

00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:33.937
Or, "Look! There's a banana tree
over there! Let's go and get bananas!"

00:07:33.961 --> 00:07:40.238
Humans, in contrast, use their language
not merely to describe reality,

00:07:40.262 --> 00:07:44.786
but also to create new realities,
fictional realities.

00:07:45.278 --> 00:07:49.232
A human can say, "Look,
there is a god above the clouds!

00:07:49.256 --> 00:07:51.336
And if you don't do what I tell you to do,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.565
when you die, God will punish you
and send you to hell."

00:07:54.986 --> 00:07:58.758
And if you all believe this story
that I've invented,

00:07:58.782 --> 00:08:02.597
then you will follow the same
norms and laws and values,

00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:03.913
and you can cooperate.

00:08:04.278 --> 00:08:06.628
This is something only humans can do.

00:08:07.207 --> 00:08:11.048
You can never convince a chimpanzee
to give you a banana

00:08:11.072 --> 00:08:14.865
by promising him, "... after you die,
you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ..."

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:15.912
(Laughter)

00:08:15.936 --> 00:08:19.198
"... and you'll receive lots and lots
of bananas for your good deeds.

00:08:19.222 --> 00:08:20.644
So now give me this banana."

00:08:20.668 --> 00:08:23.426
No chimpanzee will ever
believe such a story.

00:08:23.776 --> 00:08:26.466
Only humans believe such stories,

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.573
which is why we control the world,

00:08:28.597 --> 00:08:33.442
whereas the chimpanzees are locked up
in zoos and research laboratories.

00:08:34.904 --> 00:08:37.844
Now you may find it acceptable that yes,

00:08:37.868 --> 00:08:44.008
in the religious field, humans cooperate
by believing in the same fictions.

00:08:44.032 --> 00:08:48.984
Millions of people come together
to build a cathedral or a mosque

00:08:49.008 --> 00:08:54.750
or fight in a crusade or a jihad, because
they all believe in the same stories

00:08:54.774 --> 00:08:57.487
about God and heaven and hell.

00:08:57.979 --> 00:09:03.218
But what I want to emphasize
is that exactly the same mechanism

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:09.106
underlies all other forms
of mass-scale human cooperation,

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.650
not only in the religious field.

00:09:11.674 --> 00:09:13.952
Take, for example, the legal field.

00:09:14.531 --> 00:09:20.508
Most legal systems today in the world
are based on a belief in human rights.

00:09:21.247 --> 00:09:23.024
But what are human rights?

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:28.298
Human rights, just like God and heaven,
are just a story that we've invented.

00:09:28.322 --> 00:09:30.640
They are not an objective reality;

00:09:30.664 --> 00:09:34.330
they are not some biological effect
about homo sapiens.

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:38.518
Take a human being,
cut him open, look inside,

00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:43.669
you will find the heart, the kidneys,
neurons, hormones, DNA,

00:09:43.693 --> 00:09:45.581
but you won't find any rights.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.121
The only place you find rights
are in the stories

00:09:50.145 --> 00:09:54.278
that we have invented and spread around
over the last few centuries.

00:09:54.607 --> 00:09:59.537
They may be very positive stories,
very good stories,

00:09:59.561 --> 00:10:03.124
but they're still just fictional stories
that we've invented.

00:10:03.664 --> 00:10:06.184
The same is true of the political field.

00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:12.935
The most important factors
in modern politics are states and nations.

00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:15.133
But what are states and nations?

00:10:15.593 --> 00:10:17.718
They are not an objective reality.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.455
A mountain is an objective reality.

00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:23.763
You can see it, you can touch it,
you can even smell it.

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:25.995
But a nation or a state,

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:29.799
like Israel or Iran or France or Germany,

00:10:29.823 --> 00:10:32.563
this is just a story that we've invented

00:10:32.587 --> 00:10:34.561
and became extremely attached to.

00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:37.453
The same is true of the economic field.

00:10:37.892 --> 00:10:41.598
The most important actors today
in the global economy

00:10:41.622 --> 00:10:43.884
are companies and corporations.

00:10:44.407 --> 00:10:48.138
Many of you today, perhaps, work
for a corporation,

00:10:48.162 --> 00:10:51.212
like Google or Toyota or McDonald's.

00:10:51.577 --> 00:10:53.395
What exactly are these things?

00:10:53.982 --> 00:10:57.929
They are what lawyers call legal fictions.

00:10:58.359 --> 00:11:01.835
They are stories invented and maintained

00:11:01.859 --> 00:11:05.192
by the powerful wizards we call lawyers.

00:11:05.216 --> 00:11:06.661
(Laughter)

00:11:06.685 --> 00:11:10.104
And what do corporations do all day?

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:12.981
Mostly, they try to make money.

00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:14.744
Yet, what is money?

00:11:14.768 --> 00:11:19.934
Again, money is not an objective reality;
it has no objective value.

00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.275
Take this green piece
of paper, the dollar bill.

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:25.676
Look at it -- it has no value.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.934
You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.250
you cannot wear it.

00:11:29.633 --> 00:11:33.674
But then came along
these master storytellers --

00:11:33.698 --> 00:11:35.182
the big bankers,

00:11:35.206 --> 00:11:36.646
the finance ministers,

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.024
the prime ministers --

00:11:38.048 --> 00:11:40.526
and they tell us a very convincing story:

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.508
"Look, you see this green piece of paper?

00:11:42.532 --> 00:11:45.115
It is actually worth 10 bananas."

00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:47.700
And if I believe it, and you believe it,

00:11:47.724 --> 00:11:49.240
and everybody believes it,

00:11:49.264 --> 00:11:51.128
it actually works.

00:11:51.152 --> 00:11:54.065
I can take this worthless piece of paper,

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.726
go to the supermarket,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.757
give it to a complete stranger
whom I've never met before,

00:11:59.781 --> 00:12:04.466
and get, in exchange, real bananas
which I can actually eat.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.591
This is something amazing.

00:12:06.615 --> 00:12:08.693
You could never do it with chimpanzees.

00:12:08.717 --> 00:12:10.662
Chimpanzees trade, of course:

00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:13.436
"Yes, you give me a coconut,
I'll give you a banana."

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.698
That can work.

00:12:14.722 --> 00:12:17.714
But, you give me
a worthless piece of paper

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:19.752
and you except me to give you a banana?

00:12:19.776 --> 00:12:20.928
No way!

00:12:20.952 --> 00:12:22.533
What do you think I am, a human?

00:12:22.557 --> 00:12:24.930
(Laughter)

00:12:24.954 --> 00:12:29.073
Money, in fact, is
the most successful story

00:12:29.097 --> 00:12:31.753
ever invented and told by humans,

00:12:31.777 --> 00:12:36.120
because it is the only story
everybody believes.

00:12:36.692 --> 00:12:39.482
Not everybody believes in God,

00:12:39.506 --> 00:12:42.531
not everybody believes in human rights,

00:12:42.555 --> 00:12:45.340
not everybody believes in nationalism,

00:12:45.364 --> 00:12:49.107
but everybody believes in money,
and in the dollar bill.

00:12:49.514 --> 00:12:51.495
Take, even, Osama Bin Laden.

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:55.206
He hated American politics
and American religion

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.679
and American culture,

00:12:56.703 --> 00:12:59.509
but he had no objection
to American dollars.

00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:01.628
He was quite fond of them, actually.

00:13:01.652 --> 00:13:03.555
(Laughter)

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:05.866
To conclude, then:

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:11.658
We humans control the world
because we live in a dual reality.

00:13:12.531 --> 00:13:16.444
All other animals live
in an objective reality.

00:13:16.992 --> 00:13:21.544
Their reality consists
of objective entities,

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:25.511
like rivers and trees
and lions and elephants.

00:13:26.067 --> 00:13:29.750
We humans, we also live
in an objective reality.

00:13:29.774 --> 00:13:34.842
In our world, too, there are rivers
and trees and lions and elephants.

00:13:35.421 --> 00:13:37.266
But over the centuries,

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:42.017
we have constructed on top
of this objective reality

00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:45.534
a second layer of fictional reality,

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:49.122
a reality made of fictional entities,

00:13:49.146 --> 00:13:53.679
like nations, like gods,
like money, like corporations.

00:13:54.481 --> 00:13:59.115
And what is amazing is that
as history unfolded,

00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:04.535
this fictional reality became
more and more powerful

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:09.060
so that today, the most powerful
forces in the world

00:14:09.084 --> 00:14:11.049
are these fictional entities.

00:14:11.715 --> 00:14:18.509
Today, the very survival of rivers
and trees and lions and elephants

00:14:18.533 --> 00:14:23.638
depends on the decisions and wishes
of fictional entities,

00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:28.199
like the United States, like Google,
like the World Bank --

00:14:28.223 --> 00:14:32.262
entities that exist only
in our own imagination.

00:14:32.929 --> 00:14:34.081
Thank you.

00:14:34.105 --> 00:14:38.676
(Applause)

00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:46.509
Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have
a new book out.

00:14:46.533 --> 00:14:48.336
After Sapiens, you wrote another one,

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.947
and it's out in Hebrew, but not
yet translated into ...

00:14:50.971 --> 00:14:53.900
Yuval Noah Harari: I'm working on
the translation as we speak.

00:14:53.924 --> 00:14:56.092
BG: In the book, if I
understand it correctly,

00:14:56.116 --> 00:15:01.745
you argue that the amazing breakthroughs
that we are experiencing right now

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:04.028
not only will potentially
make our lives better,

00:15:04.052 --> 00:15:06.288
but they will create -- and I quote you --

00:15:06.312 --> 00:15:10.930
"... new classes and new class struggles,
just as the industrial revolution did."

00:15:10.954 --> 00:15:12.177
Can you elaborate for us?

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.594
YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution,

00:15:14.618 --> 00:15:19.520
we saw the creation of a new class
of the urban proletariat.

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:24.654
And much of the political and social
history of the last 200 years involved

00:15:24.678 --> 00:15:28.304
what to do with this class,
and the new problems and opportunities.

00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:32.960
Now, we see the creation of a new
massive class of useless people.

00:15:32.984 --> 00:15:33.985
(Laughter)

00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:39.370
As computers become better and better
in more and more fields,

00:15:39.394 --> 00:15:44.286
there is a distinct possibility that
computers will out-perform us

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.913
in most tasks and will make
humans redundant.

00:15:47.937 --> 00:15:50.674
And then the big political
and economic question

00:15:50.698 --> 00:15:53.061
of the 21st century will be,

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:55.247
"What do we need humans for?",

00:15:55.271 --> 00:15:58.638
or at least, "What do we need
so many humans for?"

00:15:58.662 --> 00:16:01.120
BG: Do you have an answer in the book?

00:16:01.144 --> 00:16:05.164
YNH: At present, the best guess
we have is to keep them happy

00:16:05.188 --> 00:16:06.985
with drugs and computer games ...

00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:08.010
(Laughter)

00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:11.305
but this doesn't sound
like a very appealing future.

00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:14.138
BG: Ok, so you're basically saying
in the book and now,

00:16:14.162 --> 00:16:16.948
that for all the discussion
about the growing evidence

00:16:16.972 --> 00:16:20.735
of significant economic inequality,
we are just kind of at the beginning

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:21.916
of the process?

00:16:22.225 --> 00:16:23.751
YNH: Again, it's not a prophecy;

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:27.718
it's seeing all kinds
of possibilities before us.

00:16:27.742 --> 00:16:32.724
One possibility is this creation
of a new massive class of useless people.

00:16:32.748 --> 00:16:35.888
Another possibility is
the division of humankind

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.903
into different biological castes,

00:16:38.927 --> 00:16:43.218
with the rich being upgraded
into virtual gods,

00:16:43.242 --> 00:16:47.550
and the poor being degraded
to this level of useless people.

00:16:47.574 --> 00:16:50.596
BG: I feel there is another TED talk
coming up in a year or two.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.442
Thank you, Yuval, for making the trip.

00:16:52.466 --> 00:16:53.622
YNH: Thanks!

00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:55.311
(Applause)
