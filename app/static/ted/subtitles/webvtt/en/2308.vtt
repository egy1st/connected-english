WEBVTT

00:00:01.658 --> 00:00:07.604
Imagine a place where your neighbors
greet your children by name;

00:00:07.628 --> 00:00:10.931
a place with splendid vistas;

00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:14.066
a place where you can drive
just 20 minutes

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.152
and put your sailboat on the water.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.259
It's a seductive place, isn't it?

00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:21.857
I don't live there.

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:24.430
(Laughter)

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:30.473
But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:36.859
for two years, to the fastest-growing
and whitest counties in America.

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:40.201
What is a Whitopia?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.975
I define Whitopia in three ways:

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:50.658
First, a Whitopia has posted at least
six percent population growth since 2000.

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:55.924
Secondly, the majority of that growth
comes from white migrants.

00:00:56.415 --> 00:01:00.215
And third, the Whitopia
has an ineffable charm,

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.794
a pleasant look and feel,

00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:04.326
a je Ne sais quoi.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.559
(Laughter)

00:01:07.583 --> 00:01:11.975
To learn how and why
Whitopias are ticking,

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:17.422
I immersed myself for several months
apiece in three of them:

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:20.096
first, St. George, Utah;

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.557
second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho;

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:25.184
and third, Forsyth County, Georgia.

00:01:26.883 --> 00:01:32.409
First stop, St. George --
a beautiful town of red rock landscapes.

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:37.786
In the 1850s, Brigham Young
dispatched families to St. George

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.094
to grow cotton because
of the hot, arid climate.

00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:45.546
And so they called it Utah's Dixie,
and the name sticks to this day.

00:01:48.368 --> 00:01:53.330
I approached my time in each Whitopia
like an anthropologist.

00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:57.975
I made detailed spreadsheets of all
the power brokers in the communities,

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.433
who I needed to meet,
where I needed to be,

00:02:01.457 --> 00:02:04.675
and I threw myself with gusto
in these communities.

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:06.975
I went to zoning board meetings,

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:10.762
I went to Democratic clubs
and Republican clubs.

00:02:10.786 --> 00:02:12.698
I went to poker nights.

00:02:15.206 --> 00:02:20.118
In St. George, I rented
a home at the Entrada,

00:02:20.142 --> 00:02:23.254
one of the town's
premier gated communities.

00:02:23.278 --> 00:02:27.596
There were no Motel 6's
or Howard Johnsons for me.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.954
I lived in Whitopia as a resident,
and not like a visitor.

00:02:32.883 --> 00:02:37.385
I rented myself this home by phone.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.948
(Laughter)

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:41.337
(Applause)

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:47.321
Golf is the perfect seductive
symbol of Whitopia.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.560
When I went on my journey,

00:02:49.584 --> 00:02:52.699
I had barely ever held a golf club.

00:02:52.723 --> 00:02:57.398
By the time I left, I was golfing
at least three times a week.

00:02:57.422 --> 00:03:00.109
(Laughter)

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:03.069
Golf helps people bond.

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:09.336
Some of the best interviews I ever scored
during my trip were on the golf courses.

00:03:09.716 --> 00:03:15.175
One venture capitalist, for example,
invited me to golf in his private club

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.254
that had no minority members.

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:20.408
I also went fishing.

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:22.433
(Laughter)

00:03:22.457 --> 00:03:25.473
Because I had never fished,
this fellow had to teach me

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:28.273
how to cast my line and what bait to use.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.821
I also played poker every weekend.

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:36.677
It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in.

00:03:38.058 --> 00:03:42.317
My poker mates may have been bluffing
about the hands that they drew,

00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:45.523
but they weren't bluffing
about their social beliefs.

00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:49.150
Some of the most raw,
salty conversations I ever had

00:03:49.174 --> 00:03:51.879
during my journey were at the poker table.

00:03:52.951 --> 00:03:54.957
I'm a gung ho entertainer.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.116
I love to cook, I hosted
many dinner parties, and in return,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.288
people invited me to their dinner parties,

00:04:03.312 --> 00:04:05.970
and to their barbecues,
and to their pool parties,

00:04:05.994 --> 00:04:07.789
and to their birthday parties.

00:04:09.385 --> 00:04:10.852
But it wasn't all fun.

00:04:11.781 --> 00:04:16.143
Immigration turned out to be
a big issue in this Whitopia.

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:19.581
The St. George's Citizens Council
on Illegal Immigration

00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:23.699
held regular and active protests
against immigration,

00:04:23.723 --> 00:04:29.624
and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia
is what a hot debate this would become.

00:04:29.648 --> 00:04:33.633
It was a real-time preview,
and so it has become.

00:04:35.084 --> 00:04:40.427
Next stop: Almost Heaven,
a cabin I rented for myself

00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:44.118
in Coeur d'Alene, in the beautiful
North Idaho panhandle.

00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:48.071
I rented this place
for myself, also by phone.

00:04:48.095 --> 00:04:49.475
(Laughter)

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.350
The book "A Thousand Places To See
Before You Die" lists Coeur d'Alene --

00:04:55.374 --> 00:04:59.468
it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen,
boatmen and fishermen.

00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:04.064
My growing golf skills
came in handy in Coeur d'Alene.

00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:07.032
I golfed with retired LAPD cops.

00:05:07.714 --> 00:05:13.224
In 1993, around 11,000 families and cops

00:05:13.248 --> 00:05:19.358
fled Los Angeles
after the L.A. racial unrest,

00:05:19.382 --> 00:05:23.404
for North Idaho, and they've built
an expatriated community.

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:27.822
Given the conservatism of these cops,

00:05:27.846 --> 00:05:33.188
there's no surprise that North Idaho
has a strong gun culture.

00:05:33.212 --> 00:05:38.994
In fact, it is said, North Idaho
has more gun dealers than gas stations.

00:05:41.677 --> 00:05:44.813
So what's a resident to do to fit in?

00:05:44.837 --> 00:05:46.203
I hit the gun club.

00:05:46.942 --> 00:05:50.337
When I rented a gun,
the gentleman behind the counter

00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:52.975
was perfectly pleasant and kind,

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:55.940
until I showed him
my New York City driver's license.

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:58.497
That's when he got nervous.

00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:03.036
I'm not as bad a shot
as I thought I might have been.

00:06:04.448 --> 00:06:10.904
What I learned from North Idaho
is the peculiar brand of paranoia

00:06:10.928 --> 00:06:16.043
that can permeate a community
when so many cops and guns are around.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.777
In North Idaho, in my red pickup truck,

00:06:22.801 --> 00:06:24.158
I kept a notepad.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.938
And in that notepad I counted
more Confederate flags than black people.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.852
In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags

00:06:32.876 --> 00:06:37.101
on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia,

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:38.422
and on cars.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.225
About a seven-minute drive
from my hidden lake cabin

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.066
was the compound of Aryan Nations,

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.082
the white supremacist group.

00:06:50.384 --> 00:06:55.456
America's Promise Ministries,
the religious arm of Aryan Nations,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.968
happened to have a three-day
retreat during my visit.

00:07:00.913 --> 00:07:02.548
So I decided to crash it.

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:05.184
(Laughter)

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:10.043
I'm the only non-Aryan journalist
I'm aware of ever to have done so.

00:07:10.067 --> 00:07:11.129
(Laughter)

00:07:11.153 --> 00:07:15.766
Among the many memorable
episodes of that retreat...

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.059
(Laughter)

00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:20.975
...is when Abe, an Aryan,
sidled up next to me.

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:26.419
He slapped my knee, and he said, "Hey
Rich, I just want you to know one thing.

00:07:26.443 --> 00:07:30.943
We are not white supremacists.
We are white separatists.

00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:32.841
We don't think we're better than you,

00:07:32.865 --> 00:07:34.554
we just want to be away from you."

00:07:34.578 --> 00:07:38.992
(Laughter)

00:07:39.016 --> 00:07:46.011
Indeed, most white people in Whitopia
are neither white supremacists

00:07:46.035 --> 00:07:47.850
or white separatists;

00:07:47.874 --> 00:07:51.799
in fact, they're not there
for explicitly racial reasons at all.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.196
Rather, they emigrate there

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.928
for friendliness, comfort,
security, safety --

00:07:58.952 --> 00:08:03.945
reasons that they implicitly associate
to whiteness in itself.

00:08:05.064 --> 00:08:06.938
Next stop was Georgia.

00:08:08.224 --> 00:08:12.336
In Georgia, I stayed in an exurb
north of Atlanta.

00:08:13.027 --> 00:08:14.822
In Utah, I found poker;

00:08:14.846 --> 00:08:16.537
in Idaho, I found guns;

00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:18.115
in Georgia, I found God.

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:19.378
(Laughter)

00:08:19.402 --> 00:08:22.975
The way that I immersed myself
in this Whitopia

00:08:22.999 --> 00:08:26.390
was to become active
at First Redeemer Church,

00:08:26.414 --> 00:08:29.918
a megachurch that's so huge
that it has golf carts

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:35.107
to escort the congregants around
its many parking lots on campus.

00:08:35.758 --> 00:08:38.467
I was active in the youth ministry.

00:08:38.491 --> 00:08:43.423
And for me, personally,
I was more comfortable in this Whitopia

00:08:43.447 --> 00:08:48.080
than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho,
or even a suburban Boston.

00:08:48.999 --> 00:08:52.089
That is because [there], in Georgia,

00:08:52.113 --> 00:08:56.632
white people and black people are more
historically familiar to one another.

00:08:57.092 --> 00:08:59.888
I was less exotic in this Whitopia.

00:08:59.912 --> 00:09:01.912
(Laughter)

00:09:02.684 --> 00:09:04.271
But what does it all mean?

00:09:05.042 --> 00:09:10.423
Whitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration,
is a push-pull phenomenon,

00:09:10.447 --> 00:09:14.588
full of alarming pushes
and alluring pulls,

00:09:14.612 --> 00:09:21.225
and Whitopia operates at the level
of conscious and unconscious bias.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:27.263
It's possible for people to be in Whitopia
not for racist reasons,

00:09:27.287 --> 00:09:29.577
though it has racist outcomes.

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:35.548
Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals,

00:09:35.572 --> 00:09:41.089
social welfare abuse, minorities,
density, crowded schools.

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:46.292
Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit,

00:09:46.316 --> 00:09:52.080
freedom, the allure of privatism --
privatized places, privatized people,

00:09:52.104 --> 00:09:53.421
privatized things.

00:09:55.524 --> 00:10:01.112
And I learned in Whitopia
how a country can have racism

00:10:01.136 --> 00:10:02.471
without racists.

00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:06.028
Many of my smug urban liberal friends

00:10:06.052 --> 00:10:08.789
couldn't believe I would go
on such a venture.

00:10:09.447 --> 00:10:14.969
The reality is that many white Americans
are affable and kind.

00:10:15.643 --> 00:10:20.412
Interpersonal race relations --
how we treat each other as human beings --

00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:24.043
are vastly better than in
my parents' generation.

00:10:25.162 --> 00:10:28.785
Can you imagine me going
to Whitopia 40 years ago?

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:31.484
What a journey that would have been.

00:10:31.508 --> 00:10:33.266
(Laughter)

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.159
And yet, some things haven't changed.

00:10:35.572 --> 00:10:42.283
America is as residentially
and educationally segregated today

00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:44.874
as it was in 1970.

00:10:47.523 --> 00:10:52.154
As Americans, we often find ways
to cook for each other,

00:10:52.178 --> 00:10:53.798
to dance with each other,

00:10:53.822 --> 00:10:55.695
to host with each other,

00:10:55.719 --> 00:11:00.767
but why can't that translate into how we
treat each other as communities?

00:11:01.235 --> 00:11:03.355
It's a devastating irony,

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:06.691
how we have gone forward as individuals,

00:11:06.715 --> 00:11:09.325
and backwards as communities.

00:11:11.766 --> 00:11:16.059
One of the Whitopian outlooks
that really hit me

00:11:16.083 --> 00:11:18.255
was a proverbial saying:

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:21.755
"One black man is
a delightful dinner guest;

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:23.821
50 black men is a ghetto."

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:35.755
One of the big contexts animating
my Whitopian journey was the year 2042.

00:11:36.668 --> 00:11:42.776
By 2042, white people will no longer be
the American majority.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.751
As such, will there be more Whitopias?

00:11:48.926 --> 00:11:50.613
In looking at this,

00:11:50.637 --> 00:11:57.344
the danger of Whitopia is
that the more segregation we have,

00:11:57.368 --> 00:12:03.169
the less we can look at and confront
conscious and unconscious bias.

00:12:06.304 --> 00:12:10.665
I ventured on my two-year,
27,000 mile journey

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:15.776
to learn where, why, and how
white people are fleeing,

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.542
but I didn't expect to have
so much fun on my journey.

00:12:18.566 --> 00:12:19.573
(Laughter)

00:12:19.597 --> 00:12:22.487
I didn't expect to learn
so much about myself.

00:12:23.408 --> 00:12:26.856
I don't expect I'll be living
in a Whitopia --

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.991
or a Blacktopia, for that matter.

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:33.201
I do plan to continue golfing
every chance I get.

00:12:33.225 --> 00:12:34.787
(Laughter)

00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:39.436
And I'll just have to leave the guns
and megachurches back in Whitopia.

00:12:40.714 --> 00:12:41.866
Thank you.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:47.976
(Applause)
