00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:02.320
For the past decade,

00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:05.246
I've been studying non-state armed groups:

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.137
armed organizations like terrorists,
insurgents or militias.

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:12.761
I document what these groups do
when they're not shooting.

00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:16.348
My goal is to better understand
these violent actors

00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:20.062
and to study ways to encourage transition
from violent engagement

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.963
to nonviolent confrontation.

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:25.391
I work in the field, in the policy world
and in the library.

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:30.860
Understanding non-state armed groups
is key to solving most ongoing conflict,

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:32.440
because war has changed.

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:34.924
It used to be a contest between states.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:36.719
No longer.

00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:40.681
It is now a conflict between states
and non-state actors.

00:00:41.236 --> 00:00:44.972
For example, of the 216 peace agreements

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:48.406
signed between 1975 and 2011,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.610
196 of them were between a state
and a non-state actor.

00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:56.871
So we need to understand these groups;
we need to either engage them

00:00:56.895 --> 00:01:01.784
or defeat them in any conflict resolution
process that has to be successful.

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:03.222
So how do we do that?

00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:06.809
We need to know what makes
these organizations tick.

00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:09.941
We know a lot about
how they fight, why they fight,

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:13.019
but no one looks at what they're doing
when they're not fighting.

00:01:13.043 --> 00:01:16.635
Yet, armed struggle
and unarmed politics are related.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.957
It is all part of the same organization.

00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:22.138
We cannot understand these groups,
let alone defeat them,

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:24.050
if we don't have the full picture.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.198
And armed groups today
are complex organizations.

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:30.125
Take the Lebanese Hezbollah,

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.932
known for its violent
confrontation against Israel.

00:01:32.956 --> 00:01:35.791
But since its creation in the early 1980s,

00:01:35.815 --> 00:01:38.400
Hezbollah has also set up
a political party,

00:01:38.424 --> 00:01:41.741
a social-service network,
and a military apparatus.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:44.391
Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas,

00:01:44.415 --> 00:01:46.982
known for its suicide attacks
against Israel,

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.210
also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.

00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:52.912
So these groups do way more
than just shoot.

00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:54.612
They multi-task.

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.254
They set up complex
communication machines --

00:01:58.278 --> 00:02:00.421
radio stations, TV channels,

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:03.398
Internet websites
and social media strategies.

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:05.714
And up here, you have the ISIS magazine,

00:02:05.738 --> 00:02:08.863
printed in English
and published to recruit.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.166
Armed groups also invest
in complex fund-raising --

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.053
not looting, but setting up
profitable businesses;

00:02:16.077 --> 00:02:18.467
for example, construction companies.

00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:20.374
Now, these activities are keys.

00:02:20.398 --> 00:02:22.818
They allow these groups
to increase their strength,

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.197
increase their funds,

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:27.093
to better recruit
and to build their brand.

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:29.276
Armed groups also do something else:

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.960
they build stronger bonds
with the population

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:34.433
by investing in social services.

00:02:34.457 --> 00:02:37.300
They build schools, they run hospitals,

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:41.080
they set up vocational-training programs
or micro-loan programs.

00:02:41.104 --> 00:02:44.881
Hezbollah offers all
of these services and more.

00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:47.714
Armed groups also seek
to win the population over

00:02:47.738 --> 00:02:51.638
by offering something
that the state is not providing:

00:02:51.662 --> 00:02:53.713
safety and security.

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:58.101
The initial rise of the Taliban
in war-torn Afghanistan,

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:01.002
or even the beginning
of the ascent of ISIS,

00:03:01.026 --> 00:03:04.084
can be understood also by looking
at these groups' efforts

00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:06.324
to provide security.

00:03:06.348 --> 00:03:08.619
Now, unfortunately, in these cases,

00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:11.889
the provision of security
came at an unbearably high price

00:03:11.913 --> 00:03:13.323
for the population.

00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:17.588
But in general, providing
social services fills a gap,

00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:19.873
a governance gap left by the government,

00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:22.492
and allows these groups
to increase their strength

00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:23.714
and their power.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.446
For example, the 2006 electoral victory
of the Palestinian Hamas

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.049
cannot be understood without
acknowledging the group's social work.

00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:35.070
Now, this is a really complex picture,

00:03:35.094 --> 00:03:37.571
yet in the West,
when we look at armed groups,

00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:39.797
we only think of the violent side.

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.693
But that's not enough to understand
these groups' strength,

00:03:42.717 --> 00:03:44.979
strategy or long-term vision.

00:03:45.393 --> 00:03:46.953
These groups are hybrid.

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:50.301
They rise because they fill a gap
left by the government,

00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:53.705
and they emerge
to be both armed and political,

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.949
engage in violent struggle
and provide governance.

00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:01.439
And the more these organizations
are complex and sophisticated,

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:04.804
the less we can think of them
as the opposite of a state.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:07.107
Now, what do you call
a group like Hezbollah?

00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:10.446
They run part of a territory,
they administer all their functions,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.604
they pick up the garbage,
they run the sewage system.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.339
Is this a state? Is it a rebel group?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.057
Or maybe something else,
something different and new?

00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:21.762
And what about ISIS?

00:04:21.786 --> 00:04:23.056
The lines are blurred.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.838
We live in a world of states,
non-states, and in-between,

00:04:26.862 --> 00:04:30.275
and the more states are weak,
like in the Middle East today,

00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:33.775
the more non-state actors
step in and fill that gap.

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:36.925
This matters for governments,
because to counter these groups,

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.399
they will have to invest more
in non-military tools.

00:04:41.202 --> 00:04:42.673
Filling that governance gap

00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:46.126
has to be at the center
of any sustainable approach.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.789
This also matters very much
for peacemaking and peacebuilding.

00:04:49.813 --> 00:04:51.844
If we better understand armed groups,

00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:54.330
we will better know
what incentives to offer

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:58.130
to encourage the transition
from violence to nonviolence.

00:04:58.487 --> 00:05:02.131
So in this new contest
between states and non-states,

00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:04.807
military power can win some battles,

00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:07.664
but it will not give us
peace nor stability.

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:09.933
To achieve these objectives,

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:14.762
what we need is a long-term investment
in filling that security gap,

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:16.787
in filling that governance gap

00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:19.902
that allowed these groups
to thrive in the first place.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.371
Thank you.

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:24.952
(Applause)
