00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:03.373
Today, I want to talk to you about dreams.

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:06.716
I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.716
and it's cooler than in the movies.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.683
(Laughter)

00:00:10.707 --> 00:00:13.415
Beyond flying, breathing fire,

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.280
and making hot men
spontaneously appear ...

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:18.281
(Laughter)

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:20.713
I can do things like read and write music.

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:24.675
Fun fact is that I wrote
my personal statement to college

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.019
in a dream.

00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:28.798
And I did accepted. So, yeah.

00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:31.679
I am a very visual thinker.

00:00:32.393 --> 00:00:34.642
I think in pictures, not words.

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:39.405
To me, words are more like
instincts and language.

00:00:39.993 --> 00:00:41.745
There are many people like me;

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.283
Nikola Tesla, for example,

00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:49.322
who could visualize, design,
test, and troubleshoot everything --

00:00:49.346 --> 00:00:52.752
all of his inventions --
in his mind, accurately.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.975
Language is kind of exclusive
to our species, anyway.

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.109
I am a bit more primitive,

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.701
like a beta version of Google Translate.

00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:05.337
(Laughter)

00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:10.624
My brain has the ability
to hyper-focus on things that interest me.

00:01:11.307 --> 00:01:13.974
For example, once
I had an affair with calculus

00:01:13.998 --> 00:01:16.687
that lasted longer
than some celebrity marriages.

00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:19.638
(Laughter)

00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:23.043
There are some other
unusual things about me.

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:27.217
You may have noticed
that I don't have much inflection

00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.455
in my voice.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.540
That's why people
often confuse me with a GPS.

00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:35.438
(Laughter)

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:39.981
This can make basic communication
a challenge, unless you need directions.

00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:44.420
(Laughter)

00:01:44.444 --> 00:01:45.618
Thank you.

00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:49.869
(Applause)

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.839
A few years ago, when I started
doing presentations,

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:56.492
I went to get head shots done
for the first time.

00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:00.124
The photographer told me to look flirty.

00:02:00.148 --> 00:02:02.417
(Laughter)

00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:05.030
And I had no idea
what she was talking about.

00:02:05.054 --> 00:02:06.700
(Laughter)

00:02:06.724 --> 00:02:09.152
She said, "Do that thing,
you know, with your eyes,

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:11.077
when you're flirting with guys."

00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:13.192
"What thing?" I asked.

00:02:13.608 --> 00:02:15.061
"You know, squint."

00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:17.237
And so I tried, really.

00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:18.922
It looked something like this.

00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:21.843
(Laughter)

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.490
I looked like I was searching for Waldo.

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:26.900
(Laughter)

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:30.314
There's a reason for this,

00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:32.907
as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding.

00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:37.378
(Laughter)

00:02:40.918 --> 00:02:42.506
I have Asperger's,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.522
a high-functioning form of autism

00:02:44.546 --> 00:02:48.022
that impairs the basic social skills
one is expected to display.

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:53.810
It's made life difficult in many ways,

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:57.574
and growing up,
I struggled to fit in socially.

00:02:57.955 --> 00:03:01.582
My friends would tell jokes,
but I didn't understand them.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.976
My personal heroes were George Carlin
and Stephen Colbert --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.381
and they taught me humor.

00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:14.687
My personality switched
from being shy and awkward

00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:17.504
to being defiant and cursing out a storm.

00:03:18.322 --> 00:03:21.055
Needless to say,
I did not have many friends.

00:03:21.714 --> 00:03:23.992
I was also hypersensitive to texture.

00:03:24.722 --> 00:03:28.409
The feel of water on my skin
was like pins and needles,

00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:30.727
and so for years, I refused to shower.

00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:35.219
I can assure you that my hygiene routine
is up to standards now, though.

00:03:35.243 --> 00:03:36.876
(Laughter)

00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:42.880
I had to do a lot to get here,
and my parents --

00:03:42.904 --> 00:03:47.533
things kind of got out of control
when I was sexually assaulted by a peer,

00:03:47.557 --> 00:03:52.357
and on top of everything,
it made a difficult situation worse.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.833
And I had to travel 2,000 miles
across the country to get treatment,

00:03:58.857 --> 00:04:02.531
but within days of them prescribing
a new medication,

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:05.307
my life turned into an episode
of the Walking Dead.

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.221
I became paranoid,
and began to hallucinate

00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:12.269
that rotting corpses
were coming towards me.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.611
My family finally rescued me,

00:04:15.635 --> 00:04:20.324
but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds
in those three weeks,

00:04:20.348 --> 00:04:22.777
as well as developing severe anemia,

00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:24.562
and was on the verge of suicide.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.855
I transferred to a new treatment center
that understood my aversions,

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.560
my trauma, and my social anxiety,

00:04:34.584 --> 00:04:37.900
and they knew how to treat it,
and I got the help I finally needed.

00:04:38.202 --> 00:04:40.774
And after 18 months of hard work,

00:04:40.798 --> 00:04:43.890
I went on to do incredible things.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.138
One of the things with Asperger's
is that oftentimes,

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:50.255
these people have
a very complex inner life,

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.120
and I know for myself,
I have a very colorful personality,

00:04:53.144 --> 00:04:56.848
rich ideas, and just a lot
going on in my mind.

00:04:56.872 --> 00:05:00.245
But there's a gap
between where that stands,

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:02.860
and how I communicate it
with the rest of the world.

00:05:03.416 --> 00:05:06.892
And this can make
basic communication a challenge.

00:05:08.106 --> 00:05:11.365
Not many places would hire me,
due to my lack of social skills,

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.689
which is why I applied to Waffle House.

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:19.300
(Laughter)

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.748
Waffle House is an exceptional
24-hour diner --

00:05:23.772 --> 00:05:25.725
(Laughter)

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:29.003
(Applause)

00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:30.967
thank you --

00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:32.750
where you can order your hash browns

00:05:32.774 --> 00:05:35.927
the many ways that someone
would dispose of a human corpse ...

00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:37.584
(Laughter)

00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:42.337
Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked,
topped, capped, and covered.

00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:44.464
(Laughter)

00:05:44.488 --> 00:05:45.933
As social norms would have it,

00:05:45.957 --> 00:05:49.454
you should only go to Waffle House
at an ungodly hour in the night.

00:05:49.478 --> 00:05:50.629
(Laughter)

00:05:50.653 --> 00:05:55.009
So one time, at 2 am, I was chatting
with a waitress, and I asked her,

00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:58.303
"What's the most ridiculous thing
that's happened to you on the job?"

00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:02.136
And she told me that one time,
a man walked in completely naked.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.390
(Laughter)

00:06:03.754 --> 00:06:06.262
I said, "Great! Sign me up
for the graveyard shift!"

00:06:06.286 --> 00:06:08.890
(Laughter)

00:06:08.914 --> 00:06:11.705
Needless to say,
Waffle House did not hire me.

00:06:13.838 --> 00:06:18.218
So in terms of having Asperger's,
it can be viewed as a disadvantage,

00:06:18.242 --> 00:06:20.409
and sometimes it is
a real pain in the butt,

00:06:20.433 --> 00:06:22.187
but it's also the opposite.

00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:25.802
It's a gift, and it allows me
to think innovatively.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:33.640
At 19, I won a research competition
for my research on coral reefs,

00:06:33.664 --> 00:06:35.179
and I ended up speaking

00:06:35.203 --> 00:06:37.454
at the UN Convention
of Biological Diversity,

00:06:37.478 --> 00:06:38.974
presenting this research.

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:40.686
(Applause)

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.868
Thank you.

00:06:41.892 --> 00:06:46.790
(Applause)

00:06:46.814 --> 00:06:50.809
And at 22, I'm getting ready
to graduate college,

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:55.368
and I am a co-founder of a biotech
company called AutismSees.

00:06:56.275 --> 00:06:57.283
(Applause)

00:06:57.307 --> 00:06:58.562
Thank you.

00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:01.263
(Applause)

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:04.471
But consider what I had to do to get here:

00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:09.786
25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses,
and years of pain and trauma.

00:07:10.698 --> 00:07:13.769
I spent a lot of time thinking
if there's a better way,

00:07:13.793 --> 00:07:17.845
and I think there is:
autism-assistive technology.

00:07:18.503 --> 00:07:20.520
This technology
could play an integral role

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:23.399
in helping people
with autistic spectrum disorder,

00:07:23.423 --> 00:07:24.577
or ASD.

00:07:26.465 --> 00:07:31.431
The app Podium, released
by my company, AutismSees,

00:07:31.455 --> 00:07:36.729
has the ability to independently assess
and help develop communication skills.

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:41.646
In addition to this, it tracks
eye contact through camera

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:47.577
and simulates a public-speaking
and job-interview experience.

00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:51.118
And so maybe one day,
Waffle House will hire me,

00:07:51.142 --> 00:07:53.322
after practicing on it some more.

00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:54.527
(Laughter)

00:07:57.162 --> 00:08:02.681
And one of the great things
is that I've used Podium

00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:07.791
to help me prepare for today,
and it's been a great help.

00:08:07.815 --> 00:08:09.442
But it's more than that.

00:08:09.466 --> 00:08:11.020
There's more that can be done.

00:08:12.274 --> 00:08:15.366
For people with ASD --

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.907
it has been speculated
that many innovative scientists,

00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:24.522
researchers, artists,
and engineers have it;

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:30.576
like, for example, Emily Dickinson,
Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.337
are some examples.

00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:34.114
But the problem that's encountered

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:37.975
is that these brilliant ideas
often can't be shared

00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:40.263
if there are communication roadblocks.

00:08:41.249 --> 00:08:45.975
And so, many people with autism
are being overlooked every day,

00:08:45.999 --> 00:08:47.809
and they're being taken advantage of.

00:08:49.175 --> 00:08:56.070
So my dream for people with autism
is to change that,

00:08:56.094 --> 00:08:59.021
to remove the roadblocks
that prevent them from succeeding.

00:08:59.808 --> 00:09:02.310
One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:05.216
is because it allows me to be free,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.305
without judgment of social
and physical consequences.

00:09:09.638 --> 00:09:12.640
When I'm flying over scenes
that I create in my mind,

00:09:12.664 --> 00:09:13.893
I am at peace.

00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:17.366
I am free from judgment,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.406
and so I can do whatever I want, you know?

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:24.334
I'm making out with Brad Pitt,
and Angelina is totally cool with it.

00:09:24.358 --> 00:09:26.238
(Laughter)

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:31.658
But the goal of autism-assistive
technology is bigger than that,

00:09:31.682 --> 00:09:33.043
and more important.

00:09:33.725 --> 00:09:37.646
My goal is to shift people's perspective

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.650
of autism and people
with higher-functioning Asperger's

00:09:42.674 --> 00:09:46.538
because there is a lot they can do.

00:09:46.562 --> 00:09:49.998
I mean, look at
Temple Grandin, for example.

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:55.117
And by doing so, we allow people
to share their talents with this world

00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:57.508
and move this world forward.

00:09:57.532 --> 00:10:00.754
In addition, we give them the courage
to pursue their dreams

00:10:00.778 --> 00:10:03.066
in the real world, in real time.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.249
Thank you.

00:10:04.273 --> 00:10:07.921
(Applause)

00:10:07.945 --> 00:10:09.096
Thank you.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.960
(Applause)
