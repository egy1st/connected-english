00:00:01.531 --> 00:00:03.752
I will always remember

00:00:03.776 --> 00:00:07.999
the first time I met the girl
in the blue uniform.

00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:12.165
I was eight at the time,

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.522
living in the village with my grandmother,

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:18.355
who was raising me and other children.

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:24.212
Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe,

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:27.259
and we just didn't have enough to eat.

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.386
We were hungry.

00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:35.077
And that's when the girl
in the blue uniform

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.657
came to my village with the United Nations

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:40.459
to feed the children.

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:44.363
As she handed me my porridge,

00:00:44.387 --> 00:00:47.648
I asked her why she was there,

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:51.362
and without hesitation, she said,

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:58.044
"As Africans, we must uplift
all the people of Africa."

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.737
I had absolutely no idea what she meant.

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.832
(Laughter)

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.443
But her words stuck with me.

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:09.975
Two years later,

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:13.450
famine hit my country for the second time.

00:01:14.514 --> 00:01:18.975
My grandmother had no choice
but to send me to the city

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:21.783
to live with an aunt
I had never met before.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.007
So at the age of 10,

00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:29.053
I found myself in school
for the very first time.

00:01:30.816 --> 00:01:33.459
And there, at the city school,

00:01:33.483 --> 00:01:37.514
I would experience
what it was to be unequal.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.777
You see, in the village,

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:42.070
we were all equal.

00:01:43.094 --> 00:01:46.261
But in the eyes and the minds
of the other kids,

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:48.220
I was not their equal.

00:01:49.165 --> 00:01:51.498
I couldn't speak English,

00:01:51.522 --> 00:01:55.831
and I was way behind
in terms of reading and writing.

00:01:57.197 --> 00:02:01.752
But this feeling of inequality
would get even more complex.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:04.761
Every school holiday

00:02:04.785 --> 00:02:07.920
spent back in the village
with my grandmother

00:02:07.944 --> 00:02:10.412
made me consciously aware

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:13.975
of the inequalities
this incredible opportunity

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.641
had created within my own family.

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:22.324
Suddenly, I had much more
than the rest of my village.

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:27.546
And in their eyes,
I was no longer their equal.

00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:30.443
I felt guilty.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.037
But I thought about the girl
in the blue uniform,

00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:38.324
and I remember thinking,

00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:41.157
"That's who I want to be --

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.250
someone like her,

00:02:43.274 --> 00:02:46.704
someone who uplifts other people."

00:02:47.903 --> 00:02:52.975
This childhood experience
led me to the United Nations,

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.626
and to my current role with UN Women,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.793
where we are addressing
one of the greatest inequalities

00:02:59.817 --> 00:03:03.762
that affects more than half
of the world's population --

00:03:03.786 --> 00:03:04.967
women and girls.

00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.482
Today, I want to share with you

00:03:08.506 --> 00:03:15.284
a simple idea that seeks to uplift
all of us together.

00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:18.871
Eight months ago,

00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:23.140
under the visionary leadership
of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,

00:03:23.164 --> 00:03:25.220
head of UN Women,

00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:28.245
we launched a groundbreaking initiative

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.093
called HeForShe,

00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:33.506
inviting men and boys
from around the world

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.848
to stand in solidarity
with each other and with women,

00:03:37.872 --> 00:03:41.411
to create a shared vision
for gender equality.

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:46.975
This is an invitation
for those who believe in equality

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.260
for women and men,

00:03:49.284 --> 00:03:52.847
and those who don't yet know
that they believe.

00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:57.975
The initiative is based on a simple idea:

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:02.380
that what we share is much more powerful

00:04:02.404 --> 00:04:03.840
than what divides us.

00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:07.301
We all feel the same things.

00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:10.316
We all want the same things,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.602
even when those things
sometimes remain unspoken.

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:19.078
HeForShe is about uplifting all of us,

00:04:19.102 --> 00:04:20.856
women and men together.

00:04:21.403 --> 00:04:25.736
It's moving us towards
an inflection point for gender equality.

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.150
Imagine a blank page

00:04:29.174 --> 00:04:32.285
with one horizontal line
splitting it in half.

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.403
Now imagine that women
are represented here,

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:40.125
and men are represented here.

00:04:41.165 --> 00:04:43.275
In our current population,

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:48.687
HeForShe is about moving
the 3.2 billion men,

00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:50.800
one man at a time,

00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:52.625
across that line,

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:57.975
so that ultimately,
men can stand alongside women

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.840
and be on the right side of history,

00:05:00.864 --> 00:05:06.284
making gender equality a reality
in the 21st century.

00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:12.130
However, engaging men in the movement
would prove quite controversial.

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.848
Why invite men? They are the problem.

00:05:15.872 --> 00:05:17.030
(Laughter)

00:05:17.054 --> 00:05:20.022
In fact, men don't care, we were told.

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:25.077
But something incredible happened
when we launched HeForShe.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.467
In just three days, more than 100,000 men

00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:36.848
had signed up and committed
to be agents of change for equality.

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:44.427
Within that first week, at least one man
in every single country in the world

00:05:44.451 --> 00:05:47.244
stood up to be counted,

00:05:47.268 --> 00:05:49.617
and within that same week,

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:56.054
HeForShe created more than
1.2 billion conversations on social media.

00:05:57.308 --> 00:06:01.609
And that's when the emails
started pouring in,

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:05.681
sometimes as many as a thousand a day.

00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:10.490
We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe,

00:06:10.514 --> 00:06:13.181
who, after hearing about HeForShe,

00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:14.863
created a "husband school."

00:06:15.443 --> 00:06:17.736
(Laughter)

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.712
He literally went around his village,

00:06:20.736 --> 00:06:24.998
hand-picking all of the men
that were abusive to their partners,

00:06:25.022 --> 00:06:29.387
and committed to turn them
into better husbands and fathers.

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:36.688
In Pune, India, a youth advocate
organized an innovative bicycle rally,

00:06:36.713 --> 00:06:40.348
mobilizing 700 cyclists

00:06:40.372 --> 00:06:44.665
to share the HeForShe messages
within their own community.

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:48.490
In another impact story,

00:06:48.514 --> 00:06:50.919
a man sent a very personal note

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:53.943
of something that had happened
in his own community.

00:06:54.752 --> 00:06:57.395
He wrote,

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:59.307
"Dear Madam,

00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:01.967
I have lived all of my life

00:07:01.991 --> 00:07:06.038
next door to a man
who continuously beats up his wife.

00:07:07.506 --> 00:07:09.045
Two weeks ago,

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:11.776
I was listening to my radio,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.212
and your voice came on,

00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:18.756
and you spoke about something
called the HeForShe,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.660
and the need for men to play their role.

00:07:23.023 --> 00:07:28.705
Within a few hours, I heard
the woman cry again next door,

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:31.149
but for the first time,

00:07:31.173 --> 00:07:33.166
I didn't just sit there.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.975
I felt compelled to do something,

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:40.555
so I went over
and I confronted the husband.

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:45.060
Madam, it has been two weeks,

00:07:45.084 --> 00:07:47.400
and the woman has not cried since.

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:50.935
Thank you for giving me a voice."

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:56.142
(Applause)

00:07:56.166 --> 00:07:59.975
Personal impact stories such as these

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:04.340
show that we are tapping
into something within men,

00:08:04.364 --> 00:08:07.975
but getting to a world
where women and men are equal

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:10.893
is not just a matter
of bringing men to the cause.

00:08:12.332 --> 00:08:19.316
We want concrete, systematic,
structural change that can equalize

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:24.800
the political, economic
and social realities for women and men.

00:08:25.514 --> 00:08:28.569
We are asking men
to make concrete actions,

00:08:28.593 --> 00:08:31.713
calling them to intervene
at a personal level,

00:08:31.737 --> 00:08:33.656
to change their behavior.

00:08:34.165 --> 00:08:39.165
We are calling upon governments,
businesses, universities,

00:08:39.189 --> 00:08:41.189
to change their policies.

00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:46.419
We want male leaders to become role models

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:49.919
and change agents
within their own institutions.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.697
Already, a number of prominent men
and leaders have stepped up

00:08:55.721 --> 00:08:58.165
and made some concrete
HeForShe commitments.

00:08:59.292 --> 00:09:02.775
In a few early success stories,

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:06.339
a leading French
hospitality company, Accor,

00:09:06.363 --> 00:09:10.039
has committed to eliminate the pay gap

00:09:10.063 --> 00:09:14.864
for all of its 180,000 employees by 2020.

00:09:15.459 --> 00:09:19.007
(Applause)

00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:21.467
The government of Sweden,

00:09:21.491 --> 00:09:24.150
under its current feminist government,

00:09:24.174 --> 00:09:29.333
has committed to close
both the employment and the pay gap

00:09:29.357 --> 00:09:33.626
for all of its citizens
within the current electoral term.

00:09:34.999 --> 00:09:38.101
In Japan, the University of Nagoya

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:41.380
is building, as part of
their HeForShe commitments,

00:09:41.404 --> 00:09:46.721
what will become one of Japan's
leading gender-research centers.

00:09:48.665 --> 00:09:51.172
Now, eight months later,

00:09:51.196 --> 00:09:53.133
a movement is building.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.975
We are seeing men sign up
from every single walk of life,

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:02.349
and from every single corner in the world,

00:10:02.373 --> 00:10:06.555
from the United Nations' own
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:12.197
to the Secretary-Generals of NATO
and the EU Council,

00:10:12.221 --> 00:10:14.798
from the prime minister of Bhutan

00:10:14.822 --> 00:10:16.924
to the president of Sierra Leone.

00:10:18.068 --> 00:10:22.186
In Europe alone,
all the male EU Commissioners

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.306
and the members of Parliament
of the Swedish and Iceland governments

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.741
have signed up to be HeForShe.

00:10:29.464 --> 00:10:35.257
In fact, one in 20 men in Iceland
has joined the movement.

00:10:36.681 --> 00:10:41.213
The rallying call of our passionate
goodwill ambassador, Emma Watson,

00:10:41.237 --> 00:10:45.166
has garnered more than
five billion media impressions,

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:50.191
mobilizing hundreds and thousands
of students around the world

00:10:50.215 --> 00:10:54.603
to create more than a hundred
HeForShe student associations.

00:10:56.118 --> 00:11:01.317
Now this is the beginning
of the vision that HeForShe has

00:11:01.341 --> 00:11:03.022
for the world that we want to see.

00:11:05.079 --> 00:11:06.698
Einstein once said,

00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:12.499
"A human being is part of the whole ...

00:11:12.523 --> 00:11:15.238
but he experiences himself,

00:11:15.262 --> 00:11:17.333
his thoughts and feelings,

00:11:17.357 --> 00:11:19.836
as something separate from the rest ...

00:11:20.725 --> 00:11:24.002
This delusion
is a kind of prison for us ...

00:11:24.856 --> 00:11:29.816
Our task must be
to free ourselves from this prison

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.236
by widening our circle of compassion."

00:11:34.982 --> 00:11:38.451
If women and men
are part of a greater whole,

00:11:38.475 --> 00:11:40.975
as Einstein suggests,

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:46.252
it is my hope that HeForShe
can help free us to realize

00:11:46.276 --> 00:11:50.927
that it is not our gender that defines us,

00:11:50.951 --> 00:11:53.967
but ultimately, our shared humanity.

00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:59.508
HeForShe is tapping
into women's and men's dreams,

00:11:59.532 --> 00:12:02.546
the dreams that we have for ourselves,

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:07.475
and the dreams that we have
for our families, our children,

00:12:07.499 --> 00:12:10.141
friends, communities.

00:12:11.078 --> 00:12:13.951
So that's what it is about.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:21.323
HeForShe is about uplifting
all of us together.

00:12:22.086 --> 00:12:23.245
Thank you.

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:25.928
(Applause)
