00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:06.015
I was born in a country
that no longer exists,

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:11.304
and raised by a single mother
who sold ties at a department store.

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:13.341
I bring this up

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:16.442
because the story about my father
begins with my mother.

00:00:18.223 --> 00:00:23.550
She's the one who made him
a cut-out in our family album;

00:00:23.574 --> 00:00:25.444
an empty hole,

00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:27.190
a reminder of what wasn't there.

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:32.459
I was seven years old when I last saw him,

00:00:32.483 --> 00:00:35.411
but even before then,
he was missing from my life.

00:00:36.363 --> 00:00:38.430
The Soviet Union had long collapsed,

00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:40.431
and by then, so had my family.

00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:43.338
We became desperate overnight,

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:48.189
running from landlords and collecting
bottles in exchange for food.

00:00:50.052 --> 00:00:52.681
I have few memories
of my father at this time.

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:57.168
In one, we're dancing together
in our tiny apartment in Moscow.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.561
In another, he's leaving.

00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:02.431
He liked to leave.

00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:04.030
He was good at it.

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:07.037
It became a game, of sorts, for him.

00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:10.980
He would visit once every few weeks
and then leave again.

00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:13.258
I would wait.

00:01:13.816 --> 00:01:16.352
That was the worst bit of this game,

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:17.528
the waiting.

00:01:18.084 --> 00:01:20.530
His visits lasted no longer
than a few hours,

00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:22.762
most of that time spent with my brother.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.757
I would wait for him to notice me.

00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:28.548
It's not that he didn't love me.

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:31.345
But I can't say he did, either.

00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:35.737
The year was 1996.

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.772
My mother woke me up
and said we were going on a trip.

00:01:39.678 --> 00:01:43.281
The next day, we arrived
in our new home, in California.

00:01:43.943 --> 00:01:48.306
We had spent years watching
the American soap opera "Santa Barbara,"

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.835
and now, we were there.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.541
We never said good-bye to my father.

00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:57.409
For the next year,
I continued to play my game.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:01.696
I would stare at airplanes,
waiting for him to come find me.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.188
He never did.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.708
As the years went by,
I stopped thinking about him.

00:02:08.348 --> 00:02:10.853
I stopped listening to the stories
told by my mother,

00:02:10.877 --> 00:02:12.865
of the man who destroyed my family.

00:02:13.474 --> 00:02:15.526
Instead, I invented my own father.

00:02:16.298 --> 00:02:19.495
He was the man who always wanted
to be next to me,

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.209
but died when I was seven.

00:02:22.563 --> 00:02:25.718
It was easier than trying to understand
why he wasn't there.

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:31.790
It took me 15 years to find the courage
to travel halfway around the world,

00:02:31.814 --> 00:02:34.004
to stand at the courtyard of his home.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.635
It's the same gray,
decaying Soviet building

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.996
my parents lived in
after they got married.

00:02:41.063 --> 00:02:42.917
You could say I had come home.

00:02:43.723 --> 00:02:45.363
But that's not how it felt.

00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:49.219
I knocked on his door;

00:02:49.243 --> 00:02:50.976
he didn't know I would be coming.

00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:53.473
All these years later,

00:02:53.497 --> 00:02:56.445
I found my father standing
just how I left him:

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:00.501
in the doorway, neither fully in
or out of my life.

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.529
That's my lovely grandfather watching TV.

00:03:03.553 --> 00:03:05.042
(Laughter)

00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:07.628
He showed me inside.

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:11.069
He had changed almost nothing.

00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:13.964
His home resembled a museum,

00:03:13.988 --> 00:03:18.389
the walls covered with my grandfather's
oil-painted and faded family images.

00:03:18.413 --> 00:03:21.491
Even my brother's childhood toys
were still there,

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:23.228
stored in an attic closet.

00:03:25.516 --> 00:03:29.070
It felt familiar at first,
even reassuring.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:32.003
He showed me photos of us together,

00:03:32.027 --> 00:03:34.788
he told me about the time
we got lost in the woods,

00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:37.518
and played home movies
he made in my childhood.

00:03:38.122 --> 00:03:39.954
They began so simply,

00:03:39.978 --> 00:03:44.578
a string of moments --
snapshots of our life together.

00:03:44.602 --> 00:03:48.181
(Music)

00:04:41.557 --> 00:04:42.707
(Music ends)

00:04:45.696 --> 00:04:47.180
But that was the past.

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:51.339
The man standing across from me
didn't recognize me.

00:04:52.256 --> 00:04:54.059
I didn't recognize him, either.

00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:56.836
I felt out of place.

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:59.964
He said he had been looking for me.

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:01.859
He opened a suitcase.

00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:04.948
Inside, I found letters,
a newspaper clipping,

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:07.921
and a shirt for my brother's
future wedding --

00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:11.841
items my grandfather put aside
in case he would one day meet us.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.889
In the classified section of a newspaper,

00:05:15.913 --> 00:05:20.154
my grandfather writes,
"Please help me find my grandchildren,

00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:21.992
they've been taken to America."

00:05:23.252 --> 00:05:25.921
For 15 years, my grandfather
would trawl the newspapers

00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:29.003
in search of addresses to send letters,

00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:31.865
hundreds of them sent to homes in America.

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.746
None made it to our doorstep.

00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:38.072
A part of me wanted
to get to know my father.

00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:40.673
There had been a life before he had me.

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:43.905
I eventually moved in with him.

00:05:45.427 --> 00:05:48.231
We would often spend
the mornings together,

00:05:48.255 --> 00:05:50.846
my father sitting across
the kitchen table,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.247
telling me stories,
like we were old friends.

00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:56.296
I had forgotten so much about him:

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.102
the shape of his face,

00:05:58.126 --> 00:05:59.916
the sound of his voice,

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.173
the way he laughed.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:06.428
I listened to him speak about the past
and his feelings for my mother.

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.063
My parents met in university in Armenia.

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.778
My mother had just turned 21.

00:06:13.631 --> 00:06:15.932
It's odd to see images of them together.

00:06:16.868 --> 00:06:19.575
They look so happy, so in love.

00:06:20.345 --> 00:06:22.876
All I ever knew was her disappointment.

00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:28.723
Not too long ago,
my father had another child,

00:06:28.747 --> 00:06:29.900
a little girl.

00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:32.566
I should be happy for him.

00:06:33.242 --> 00:06:34.692
But watching him play with her

00:06:34.716 --> 00:06:37.600
feels like a bruise
someone keeps pressing.

00:06:37.624 --> 00:06:42.087
I can't help but wonder
why she gets to have a father,

00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:43.288
and I don't.

00:06:45.091 --> 00:06:49.336
Even now, there are moments
when I feel so close to him,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.727
like the night he shared
his poetry with me.

00:06:52.557 --> 00:06:56.276
Or the time at the symphony
he snuck in chocolates for us.

00:06:56.803 --> 00:06:58.437
We ate them in the dark.

00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:02.868
But then, all at once, he's not there,

00:07:02.892 --> 00:07:05.649
as if those moments
had never even existed.

00:07:07.621 --> 00:07:09.601
He's not the only one who's distant.

00:07:10.327 --> 00:07:13.237
I often don't know
how to behave around my father.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.428
Sometimes he watches me brush my hair,

00:07:16.452 --> 00:07:18.088
or reaches to embrace me.

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:20.474
When he does, I pull away.

00:07:21.272 --> 00:07:23.632
I still don't know what he is to me

00:07:23.656 --> 00:07:25.112
or what I am to him.

00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:30.227
I started to photograph him,
the space between us,

00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:32.462
as a way of working through that void.

00:07:33.091 --> 00:07:35.406
He picked up his camera as well,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.206
and started to photograph me.

00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:42.536
It was a way for us to be together
without the past intruding.

00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:45.376
In some of his images,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.257
he wrote messages to express
the things he couldn't say otherwise.

00:07:50.113 --> 00:07:53.210
"I'm searching for
the little girl in her," he writes,

00:07:53.234 --> 00:07:57.322
"The little girl I used to know,
the one I was once close to.

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:01.699
In myself, I'm searching for the feelings
I once felt for her."

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:08.804
When I look at him,
I see so much of myself --

00:08:08.828 --> 00:08:12.437
his desire to be alone
and his need to create.

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:20.291
When I focus on that,
there's something there.

00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:26.096
But when I look back, I see a hole
his current presence will never fill.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:30.182
And that's often where my focus ends up,

00:08:30.206 --> 00:08:33.231
making this not so much
a photography project,

00:08:33.255 --> 00:08:34.430
but a wound.

00:08:35.735 --> 00:08:38.086
And I've only now realized how deep it is.

00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:39.856
Thank you.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:46.880
(Applause)

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:53.660
Bruno Giussani: That is a very powerful
story, thank you for sharing it.

00:08:53.684 --> 00:08:55.050
What are you working on now?

00:08:55.074 --> 00:08:59.000
Diana Markosian: After this project,

00:08:59.024 --> 00:09:03.149
my entire focus on my profession
and my work shifted,

00:09:03.173 --> 00:09:05.174
and it became much more personal.

00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:07.846
And all of my projects, all of my thinking

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.473
became much more personal.

00:09:09.497 --> 00:09:14.203
So, for the last year, I've been traveling
between Turkey and Armenia,

00:09:14.227 --> 00:09:16.148
looking at the Armenian genocide,

00:09:16.172 --> 00:09:20.097
and working on a story
for the Smithsonian,

00:09:20.121 --> 00:09:24.809
and also a piece for National Geographic
that's going to be published in December.

00:09:24.833 --> 00:09:26.469
BG: We're looking forward to that.

00:09:26.493 --> 00:09:28.580
Thank you for coming
and sharing your story.

00:09:28.604 --> 00:09:29.905
DM: Thank you.

00:09:29.929 --> 00:09:33.818
(Applause)
