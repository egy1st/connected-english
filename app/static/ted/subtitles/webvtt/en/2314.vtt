00:00:01.343 --> 00:00:03.072
For more than 100 years,

00:00:03.096 --> 00:00:07.122
the telephone companies have provided
wiretapping assistance to governments.

00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:10.684
For much of this time,
this assistance was manual.

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:14.826
Surveillance took place manually
and wires were connected by hand.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.600
Calls were recorded to tape.

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:19.478
But as in so many other industries,

00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:21.268
computing has changed everything.

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:24.748
The telephone companies
built surveillance features

00:00:24.772 --> 00:00:26.817
into the very core of their networks.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.474
I want that to sink in for a second:

00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:33.758
Our telephones and the networks
that carry our calls

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:36.155
were wired for surveillance first.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:37.582
First and foremost.

00:00:38.763 --> 00:00:42.589
So what that means is that
when you're talking to your spouse,

00:00:42.613 --> 00:00:46.935
your children, a colleague
or your doctor on the telephone,

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:48.445
someone could be listening.

00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.466
Now, that someone might
be your own government;

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.653
it could also be another government,
a foreign intelligence service,

00:00:55.677 --> 00:00:58.504
or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker

00:00:58.528 --> 00:01:02.098
or any other party that breaks into
the surveillance system,

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:06.611
that hacks into the surveillance system
of the telephone companies.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:12.356
But while the telephone companies
have built surveillance as a priority,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.196
Silicon Valley companies have not.

00:01:14.523 --> 00:01:17.042
And increasingly,
over the last couple years,

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:20.728
Silicon Valley companies have built
strong encryption technology

00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:22.690
into their communications products

00:01:22.714 --> 00:01:24.980
that makes surveillance
extremely difficult.

00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:27.590
For example, many of you
might have an iPhone,

00:01:27.614 --> 00:01:30.304
and if you use an iPhone
to send a text message

00:01:30.328 --> 00:01:32.505
to other people who have an iPhone,

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:35.539
those text messages
cannot easily be wiretapped.

00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:37.391
And in fact, according to Apple,

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:40.306
they're not able to even see
the text messages themselves.

00:01:40.662 --> 00:01:44.528
Likewise, if you use FaceTime
to make an audio call

00:01:44.552 --> 00:01:47.163
or a video call with one of your
friends or loved ones,

00:01:47.187 --> 00:01:49.316
that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.885
And it's not just Apple.

00:01:51.315 --> 00:01:53.667
WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook

00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:56.549
and used by hundreds of millions
of people around the world,

00:01:56.573 --> 00:02:00.080
also has built strong
encryption technology into its product,

00:02:00.104 --> 00:02:03.611
which means that people
in the Global South can easily communicate

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:06.445
without their governments,
often authoritarian,

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.203
wiretapping their text messages.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.544
So, after 100 years of being able
to listen to any telephone call --

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:17.122
anytime, anywhere --

00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:20.277
you might imagine that government
officials are not very happy.

00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:22.087
And in fact, that's what's happening.

00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:24.330
Government officials are extremely mad.

00:02:24.354 --> 00:02:28.229
And they're not mad because
these encryption tools are now available.

00:02:28.253 --> 00:02:30.071
What upsets them the most

00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:34.262
is that the tech companies have built
encryption features into their products

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:36.159
and turned them on by default.

00:02:36.547 --> 00:02:38.517
It's the default piece that matters.

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:42.316
In short, the tech companies
have democratized encryption.

00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:46.962
And so, government officials
like British Prime Minister David Cameron,

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:51.833
they believe that all communications --
emails, texts, voice calls --

00:02:51.857 --> 00:02:54.445
all of these should be
available to governments,

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.571
and encryption is making that difficult.

00:02:57.478 --> 00:03:00.862
Now, look -- I'm extremely sympathetic
to their point of view.

00:03:00.886 --> 00:03:03.418
We live in a dangerous time
in a dangerous world,

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:05.442
and there really are bad people out there.

00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:08.581
There are terrorists and other
serious national security threats

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:12.582
that I suspect we all want
the FBI and the NSA to monitor.

00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:16.048
But those surveillance
features come at a cost.

00:03:17.357 --> 00:03:18.512
The reason for that is

00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:21.022
that there is no such thing
as a terrorist laptop,

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:22.553
or a drug dealer's cell phone.

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:25.865
We all use the same
communications devices.

00:03:26.577 --> 00:03:30.252
What that means is that
if the drug dealers' telephone calls

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.821
or the terrorists' telephone calls
can be intercepted,

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.841
then so can the rest of ours, too.

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:36.492
And I think we really need to ask:

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:39.643
Should a billion people
around the world be using devices

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.086
that are wiretap friendly?

00:03:43.407 --> 00:03:47.155
So the scenario of hacking of surveillance
systems that I've described --

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:49.290
this is not imaginary.

00:03:49.622 --> 00:03:50.774
In 2009,

00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:54.845
the surveillance systems that Google
and Microsoft built into their networks --

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:58.360
the systems that they use to respond
to lawful surveillance requests

00:03:58.384 --> 00:03:59.550
from the police --

00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:02.242
those systems were compromised
by the Chinese government,

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:04.663
because the Chinese government
wanted to figure out

00:04:04.687 --> 00:04:07.579
which of their own agents
the US government was monitoring.

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.540
By the same token,

00:04:09.564 --> 00:04:12.983
in 2004, the surveillance system
built into the network

00:04:13.007 --> 00:04:16.181
of Vodafone Greece --
Greece's largest telephone company --

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.784
was compromised by an unknown entity,

00:04:18.808 --> 00:04:20.848
and that feature,
the surveillance feature,

00:04:20.872 --> 00:04:23.150
was used to wiretap
the Greek Prime Minister

00:04:23.174 --> 00:04:24.893
and members of the Greek cabinet.

00:04:25.313 --> 00:04:28.377
The foreign government or hackers
who did that were never caught.

00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:33.652
And really, this gets to the very problem
with these surveillance features,

00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:34.936
or backdoors.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.162
When you build a backdoor
into a communications network

00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:39.487
or piece of technology,

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:42.559
you have no way of controlling
who's going to go through it.

00:04:43.243 --> 00:04:44.688
You have no way of controlling

00:04:44.712 --> 00:04:47.482
whether it'll be used by your side
or the other side,

00:04:47.506 --> 00:04:49.417
by good guys, or by bad guys.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.499
And so for that reason,
I think that it's better

00:04:52.523 --> 00:04:55.175
to build networks
to be as secure as possible.

00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:58.680
Yes, this means that in the future,

00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:01.270
encryption is going to make
wiretapping more difficult.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.949
It means that the police
are going to have a tougher time

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.285
catching bad guys.

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:07.865
But the alternative would mean
to live in a world

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.520
where anyone's calls or anyone's
text messages could be surveilled

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:15.270
by criminals, by stalkers
and by foreign intelligence agencies.

00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:17.606
And I don't want to live
in that kind of world.

00:05:18.102 --> 00:05:20.817
And so right now,
you probably have the tools

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:23.159
to thwart many kinds
of government surveillance

00:05:23.183 --> 00:05:26.166
already on your phones
and already in your pockets,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.969
you just might not realize how strong
and how secure those tools are,

00:05:29.993 --> 00:05:33.522
or how weak the other ways
you've used to communicate really are.

00:05:34.737 --> 00:05:36.864
And so, my message to you is this:

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.763
We need to use these tools.

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:42.543
We need to secure our telephone calls.

00:05:42.567 --> 00:05:44.416
We need to secure our text messages.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.602
I want you to use these tools.

00:05:46.626 --> 00:05:49.982
I want you to tell your loved ones,
I want you to tell your colleagues:

00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:52.430
Use these encrypted communications tools.

00:05:52.454 --> 00:05:55.130
Don't just use them
because they're cheap and easy,

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:57.158
but use them because they're secure.

00:05:57.182 --> 00:05:58.437
Thank you.

00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:02.047
(Applause)
