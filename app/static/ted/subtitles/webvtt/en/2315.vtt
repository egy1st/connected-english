00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:05.793
This is a painting from the 16th century
from Lucas Cranach the Elder.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.926
It shows the famous Fountain of Youth.

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:15.034
If you drink its water or you bathe in it,
you will get health and youth.

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:21.406
Every culture, every civilization
has dreamed of finding eternal youth.

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:26.796
There are people like Alexander the Great
or Ponce De LeÃ³n, the explorer,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.251
who spent much of their life
chasing the Fountain of Youth.

00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:31.894
They didn't find it.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.050
But what if there was something to it?

00:00:36.074 --> 00:00:38.773
What if there was something
to this Fountain of Youth?

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:44.462
I will share an absolutely amazing
development in aging research

00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:48.096
that could revolutionize
the way we think about aging

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.322
and how we may treat age-related
diseases in the future.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:54.654
It started with experiments that showed,

00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:57.972
in a recent number
of studies about growing,

00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:03.997
that animals -- old mice --
that share a blood supply with young mice

00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:05.625
can get rejuvenated.

00:01:06.148 --> 00:01:10.757
This is similar to what you might see
in humans, in Siamese twins,

00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:12.869
and I know this sounds a bit creepy.

00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:19.285
But what Tom Rando, a stem-cell
researcher, reported in 2007,

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:22.809
was that old muscle from a mouse
can be rejuvenated

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:27.462
if it's exposed to young blood
through common circulation.

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:32.546
This was reproduced by Amy Wagers
at Harvard a few years later,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.165
and others then showed that similar
rejuvenating effects could be observed

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.975
in the pancreas, the liver and the heart.

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:45.071
But what I'm most excited about,
and several other labs as well,

00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:47.514
is that this may even apply to the brain.

00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:54.046
So, what we found is that an old mouse
exposed to a young environment

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.083
in this model called parabiosis,

00:01:57.107 --> 00:01:58.899
shows a younger brain --

00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:01.105
and a brain that functions better.

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:03.556
And I repeat:

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.793
an old mouse that gets young blood
through shared circulation

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:12.801
looks younger and functions
younger in its brain.

00:02:13.998 --> 00:02:15.530
So when we get older --

00:02:15.554 --> 00:02:18.226
we can look at different aspects
of human cognition,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.003
and you can see on this slide here,

00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:23.410
we can look at reasoning,
verbal ability and so forth.

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:29.178
And up to around age 50 or 60,
these functions are all intact,

00:02:29.202 --> 00:02:33.684
and as I look at the young audience
here in the room, we're all still fine.

00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:34.716
(Laughter)

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.547
But it's scary to see
how all these curves go south.

00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:40.160
And as we get older,

00:02:40.184 --> 00:02:44.235
diseases such as Alzheimer's
and others may develop.

00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:48.575
We know that with age,
the connections between neurons --

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.250
the way neurons talk to each other,
the synapses -- they start to deteriorate;

00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:56.580
neurons die, the brain starts to shrink,

00:02:56.604 --> 00:03:00.596
and there's an increased susceptibility
for these neurodegenerative diseases.

00:03:01.573 --> 00:03:06.482
One big problem we have -- to try
to understand how this really works

00:03:06.506 --> 00:03:09.102
at a very molecular mechanistic level --

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:13.176
is that we can't study the brains
in detail, in living people.

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:17.019
We can do cognitive tests,
we can do imaging --

00:03:17.043 --> 00:03:19.739
all kinds of sophisticated testing.

00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:23.381
But we usually have to wait
until the person dies

00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:28.499
to get the brain and look at how it really
changed through age or in a disease.

00:03:28.888 --> 00:03:31.952
This is what neuropathologists
do, for example.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:38.000
So, how about we think of the brain
as being part of the larger organism.

00:03:38.024 --> 00:03:40.501
Could we potentially understand more

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:43.454
about what happens in the brain
at the molecular level

00:03:43.478 --> 00:03:47.064
if we see the brain
as part of the entire body?

00:03:47.088 --> 00:03:51.965
So if the body ages or gets sick,
does that affect the brain?

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.412
And vice versa: as the brain gets older,
does that influence the rest of the body?

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.541
And what connects all the different
tissues in the body

00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:01.715
is blood.

00:04:02.366 --> 00:04:08.191
Blood is the tissue that not only carries
cells that transport oxygen, for example,

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:09.456
the red blood cells,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.680
or fights infectious diseases,

00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:15.975
but it also carries messenger molecules,

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:19.911
hormone-like factors
that transport information

00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:24.068
from one cell to another,
from one tissue to another,

00:04:24.092 --> 00:04:25.549
including the brain.

00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:30.711
So if we look at how the blood
changes in disease or age,

00:04:30.735 --> 00:04:33.098
can we learn something about the brain?

00:04:33.651 --> 00:04:38.487
We know that as we get older,
the blood changes as well,

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:41.470
so these hormone-like factors
change as we get older.

00:04:41.494 --> 00:04:45.693
And by and large,
factors that we know are required

00:04:45.717 --> 00:04:49.138
for the development of tissues,
for the maintenance of tissues --

00:04:49.162 --> 00:04:52.039
they start to decrease as we get older,

00:04:52.063 --> 00:04:56.766
while factors involved in repair,
in injury and in inflammation --

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.740
they increase as we get older.

00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:03.806
So there's this unbalance of good
and bad factors, if you will.

00:05:04.988 --> 00:05:07.981
And to illustrate what we can do
potentially with that,

00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:10.657
I want to talk you through
an experiment that we did.

00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:14.330
We had almost 300 blood samples
from healthy human beings

00:05:14.354 --> 00:05:16.871
20 to 89 years of age,

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:20.790
and we measured over 100
of these communication factors,

00:05:20.814 --> 00:05:24.908
these hormone-like proteins that
transport information between tissues.

00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:26.942
And what we noticed first

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:29.783
is that between the youngest
and the oldest group,

00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:33.104
about half the factors
changed significantly.

00:05:33.128 --> 00:05:36.263
So our body lives in a very
different environment as we get older,

00:05:36.287 --> 00:05:38.038
when it comes to these factors.

00:05:38.062 --> 00:05:41.558
And using statistical
or bioinformatics programs,

00:05:41.582 --> 00:05:46.276
we could try to discover
those factors that best predict age --

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.943
in a way, back-calculate
the relative age of a person.

00:05:50.337 --> 00:05:53.193
And the way this looks
is shown in this graph.

00:05:53.618 --> 00:05:58.987
So, on the one axis you see
the actual age a person lived,

00:05:59.011 --> 00:06:00.316
the chronological age.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.062
So, how many years they lived.

00:06:02.086 --> 00:06:04.794
And then we take these top factors
that I showed you,

00:06:04.818 --> 00:06:09.662
and we calculate their relative age,
their biological age.

00:06:10.708 --> 00:06:14.342
And what you see is that
there is a pretty good correlation,

00:06:14.366 --> 00:06:17.681
so we can pretty well predict
the relative age of a person.

00:06:17.705 --> 00:06:21.620
But what's really exciting
are the outliers,

00:06:21.644 --> 00:06:23.448
as they so often are in life.

00:06:23.922 --> 00:06:28.490
You can see here, the person
I highlighted with the green dot

00:06:28.514 --> 00:06:31.110
is about 70 years of age

00:06:31.134 --> 00:06:36.140
but seems to have a biological age,
if what we're doing here is really true,

00:06:36.164 --> 00:06:38.207
of only about 45.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.715
So is this a person that actually
looks much younger than their age?

00:06:42.183 --> 00:06:46.699
But more importantly: Is this a person
who is maybe at a reduced risk

00:06:46.723 --> 00:06:50.047
to develop an age-related disease
and will have a long life --

00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:51.566
will live to 100 or more?

00:06:52.402 --> 00:06:56.963
On the other hand, the person here,
highlighted with the red dot,

00:06:56.987 --> 00:07:01.893
is not even 40,
but has a biological age of 65.

00:07:01.917 --> 00:07:06.315
Is this a person at an increased risk
of developing an age-related disease?

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:09.995
So in our lab, we're trying
to understand these factors better,

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:12.257
and many other groups
are trying to understand,

00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:14.357
what are the true aging factors,

00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:19.354
and can we learn something about them
to possibly predict age-related diseases?

00:07:20.281 --> 00:07:24.343
So what I've shown you so far
is simply correlational, right?

00:07:24.367 --> 00:07:28.398
You can just say,
"Well, these factors change with age,"

00:07:28.422 --> 00:07:32.077
but you don't really know
if they do something about aging.

00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:36.079
So what I'm going to show you now
is very remarkable

00:07:36.103 --> 00:07:41.174
and it suggests that these factors
can actually modulate the age of a tissue.

00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:45.143
And that's where we come back
to this model called parabiosis.

00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:47.707
So, parabiosis is done in mice

00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:52.643
by surgically connecting
the two mice together,

00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:55.000
and that leads then
to a shared blood system,

00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:59.811
where we can now ask,
"How does the old brain get influenced

00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:01.573
by exposure to the young blood?"

00:08:02.144 --> 00:08:04.348
And for this purpose, we use young mice

00:08:04.372 --> 00:08:07.825
that are an equivalency
of 20-year-old people,

00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:12.185
and old mice that are roughly
65 years old in human years.

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.784
What we found is quite remarkable.

00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:19.528
We find there are more neural stem cells
that make new neurons

00:08:19.552 --> 00:08:20.884
in these old brains.

00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:23.933
There's an increased
activity of the synapses,

00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:25.996
the connections between neurons.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.305
There are more genes expressed
that are known to be involved

00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:31.076
in the formation of new memories.

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:34.167
And there's less of this bad inflammation.

00:08:35.427 --> 00:08:41.923
But we observed that there are no cells
entering the brains of these animals.

00:08:41.947 --> 00:08:43.333
So when we connect them,

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:48.733
there are actually no cells
going into the old brain, in this model.

00:08:49.379 --> 00:08:53.040
Instead, we've reasoned, then,
that it must be the soluble factors,

00:08:53.064 --> 00:08:57.847
so we could collect simply the soluble
fraction of blood which is called plasma,

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.815
and inject either young plasma
or old plasma into these mice,

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:04.207
and we could reproduce
these rejuvenating effects,

00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:05.945
but what we could also do now

00:09:05.969 --> 00:09:08.419
is we could do memory tests with mice.

00:09:08.443 --> 00:09:12.296
As mice get older, like us humans,
they have memory problems.

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.411
It's just harder to detect them,

00:09:14.435 --> 00:09:16.779
but I'll show you in a minute
how we do that.

00:09:16.803 --> 00:09:19.498
But we wanted to take this
one step further,

00:09:19.522 --> 00:09:23.562
one step closer to potentially
being relevant to humans.

00:09:23.586 --> 00:09:26.783
What I'm showing you now
are unpublished studies,

00:09:26.807 --> 00:09:31.340
where we used human plasma,
young human plasma,

00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:33.213
and as a control, saline,

00:09:33.237 --> 00:09:35.113
and injected it into old mice,

00:09:35.137 --> 00:09:39.989
and asked, can we again
rejuvenate these old mice?

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.673
Can we make them smarter?

00:09:42.104 --> 00:09:45.393
And to do this, we used a test.
It's called a Barnes maze.

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:48.572
This is a big table
that has lots of holes in it,

00:09:48.596 --> 00:09:52.079
and there are guide marks around it,

00:09:52.103 --> 00:09:54.709
and there's a bright light,
as on this stage here.

00:09:54.733 --> 00:09:57.866
The mice hate this and they try to escape,

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.146
and find the single hole that you see
pointed at with an arrow,

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.115
where a tube is mounted underneath

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:07.332
where they can escape
and feel comfortable in a dark hole.

00:10:07.977 --> 00:10:09.779
So we teach them, over several days,

00:10:09.803 --> 00:10:12.706
to find this space
on these cues in the space,

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.524
and you can compare this for humans,

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:19.778
to finding your car in a parking lot
after a busy day of shopping.

00:10:19.802 --> 00:10:20.803
(Laughter)

00:10:20.827 --> 00:10:24.578
Many of us have probably had
some problems with that.

00:10:24.602 --> 00:10:26.620
So, let's look at an old mouse here.

00:10:26.954 --> 00:10:29.130
This is an old mouse
that has memory problems,

00:10:29.154 --> 00:10:30.843
as you'll notice in a moment.

00:10:31.305 --> 00:10:36.029
It just looks into every hole,
but it didn't form this spacial map

00:10:36.053 --> 00:10:41.300
that would remind it where it was
in the previous trial or the last day.

00:10:41.873 --> 00:10:47.340
In stark contrast, this mouse here
is a sibling of the same age,

00:10:47.364 --> 00:10:52.783
but it was treated with young
human plasma for three weeks,

00:10:52.807 --> 00:10:55.340
with small injections every three days.

00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:59.964
And as you noticed, it almost
looks around, "Where am I?" --

00:10:59.988 --> 00:11:02.895
and then walks straight
to that hole and escapes.

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:05.783
So, it could remember where that hole was.

00:11:06.742 --> 00:11:10.430
So by all means, this old mouse
seems to be rejuvenated --

00:11:10.454 --> 00:11:12.833
it functions more like a younger mouse.

00:11:12.857 --> 00:11:15.563
And it also suggests
that there is something

00:11:15.587 --> 00:11:20.578
not only in young mouse plasma,
but in young human plasma

00:11:20.602 --> 00:11:24.262
that has the capacity
to help this old brain.

00:11:24.834 --> 00:11:25.986
So to summarize,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.209
we find the old mouse, and its brain
in particular, are malleable.

00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:33.684
They're not set in stone;
we can actually change them.

00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:35.181
It can be rejuvenated.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.277
Young blood factors can reverse aging,

00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:40.013
and what I didn't show you --

00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:45.259
in this model, the young mouse actually
suffers from exposure to the old.

00:11:45.283 --> 00:11:48.663
So there are old-blood factors
that can accelerate aging.

00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:54.042
And most importantly,
humans may have similar factors,

00:11:54.066 --> 00:11:58.144
because we can take young human
blood and have a similar effect.

00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:02.148
Old human blood, I didn't show you,
does not have this effect;

00:12:02.172 --> 00:12:03.934
it does not make the mice younger.

00:12:05.071 --> 00:12:08.699
So, is this magic transferable to humans?

00:12:08.723 --> 00:12:12.352
We're running a small
clinical study at Stanford,

00:12:12.376 --> 00:12:16.252
where we treat Alzheimer's patients
with mild disease

00:12:16.276 --> 00:12:22.886
with a pint of plasma
from young volunteers, 20-year-olds,

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.505
and do this once a week for four weeks,

00:12:25.529 --> 00:12:28.692
and then we look
at their brains with imaging.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.894
We test them cognitively,

00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:34.924
and we ask their caregivers
for daily activities of living.

00:12:34.948 --> 00:12:38.867
What we hope is that there are
some signs of improvement

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:40.255
from this treatment.

00:12:40.758 --> 00:12:43.314
And if that's the case,
that could give us hope

00:12:43.338 --> 00:12:45.758
that what I showed you works in mice

00:12:45.782 --> 00:12:47.560
might also work in humans.

00:12:48.478 --> 00:12:50.836
Now, I don't think we will live forever.

00:12:51.955 --> 00:12:54.292
But maybe we discovered

00:12:54.316 --> 00:12:57.403
that the Fountain of Youth
is actually within us,

00:12:57.427 --> 00:12:59.165
and it has just dried out.

00:12:59.574 --> 00:13:02.402
And if we can turn it
back on a little bit,

00:13:02.426 --> 00:13:07.053
maybe we can find the factors
that are mediating these effects,

00:13:07.077 --> 00:13:09.664
we can produce these factors synthetically

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:13.701
and we can treat diseases of aging,
such as Alzheimer's disease

00:13:13.725 --> 00:13:14.955
or other dementias.

00:13:15.282 --> 00:13:16.433
Thank you very much.

00:13:16.457 --> 00:13:19.750
