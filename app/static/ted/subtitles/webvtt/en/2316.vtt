WEBVTT

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.718
I'd like to introduce you
to an emerging area of science,

00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:09.685
one that is still speculative
but hugely exciting,

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.338
and certainly one
that's growing very rapidly.

00:00:13.448 --> 00:00:17.496
Quantum biology
asks a very simple question:

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.870
Does quantum mechanics --

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:22.196
that weird and wonderful
and powerful theory

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.908
of the subatomic world
of atoms and molecules

00:00:24.932 --> 00:00:28.420
that underpins so much
of modern physics and chemistry --

00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:31.856
also play a role inside the living cell?

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.959
In other words: Are there processes,
mechanisms, phenomena

00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:39.971
in living organisms
that can only be explained

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:42.738
with a helping hand
from quantum mechanics?

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:45.183
Now, quantum biology isn't new;

00:00:45.207 --> 00:00:47.608
it's been around since the early 1930s.

00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:51.643
But it's only in the last decade or so
that careful experiments --

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:55.131
in biochemistry labs,
using spectroscopy --

00:00:55.155 --> 00:01:02.018
have shown very clear, firm evidence
that there are certain specific mechanisms

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:04.553
that require quantum mechanics
to explain them.

00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:09.003
Quantum biology brings together
quantum physicists, biochemists,

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:12.668
molecular biologists --
it's a very interdisciplinary field.

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:16.621
I come from quantum physics,
so I'm a nuclear physicist.

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:18.910
I've spent more than three decades

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:21.863
trying to get my head
around quantum mechanics.

00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:24.380
One of the founders
of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr,

00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:27.754
said, If you're not astonished by it,
then you haven't understood it.

00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:31.080
So I sort of feel happy
that I'm still astonished by it.

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:32.849
That's a good thing.

00:01:32.873 --> 00:01:39.758
But it means I study the very
smallest structures in the universe --

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:41.857
the building blocks of reality.

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:45.096
If we think about the scale of size,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.072
start with an everyday object
like the tennis ball,

00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:50.997
and just go down orders
of magnitude in size --

00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:56.218
from the eye of a needle down to a cell,
down to a bacterium, down to an enzyme --

00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:57.971
you eventually reach the nano-world.

00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:00.490
Now, nanotechnology may be
a term you've heard of.

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:03.694
A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.930
My area is the atomic nucleus,
which is the tiny dot inside an atom.

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:10.886
It's even smaller in scale.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.828
This is the domain of quantum mechanics,

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:15.368
and physicists and chemists
have had a long time

00:02:15.392 --> 00:02:16.693
to try and get used to it.

00:02:17.248 --> 00:02:21.705
Biologists, on the other hand,
have got off lightly, in my view.

00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:26.402
They are very happy with their
balls-and-sticks models of molecules.

00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:27.508
(Laughter)

00:02:27.532 --> 00:02:30.730
The balls are the atoms, the sticks
are the bonds between the atoms.

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:33.248
And when they can't build them
physically in the lab,

00:02:33.272 --> 00:02:35.664
nowadays, they have
very powerful computers

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.655
that will simulate a huge molecule.

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:41.343
This is a protein made up
of 100,000 atoms.

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:46.338
It doesn't really require much in the way
of quantum mechanics to explain it.

00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:50.584
Quantum mechanics
was developed in the 1920s.

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:57.845
It is a set of beautiful and powerful
mathematical rules and ideas

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.477
that explain the world of the very small.

00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:03.873
And it's a world that's very different
from our everyday world,

00:03:03.897 --> 00:03:05.416
made up of trillions of atoms.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.997
It's a world built
on probability and chance.

00:03:09.818 --> 00:03:11.120
It's a fuzzy world.

00:03:11.144 --> 00:03:12.874
It's a world of phantoms,

00:03:12.898 --> 00:03:16.246
where particles can also behave
like spread-out waves.

00:03:18.157 --> 00:03:21.019
If we imagine quantum mechanics
or quantum physics, then,

00:03:21.043 --> 00:03:26.257
as the fundamental
foundation of reality itself,

00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:28.011
then it's not surprising that we say

00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:30.455
quantum physics underpins
organic chemistry.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.599
After all, it gives us
the rules that tell us

00:03:32.623 --> 00:03:35.264
how the atoms fit together
to make organic molecules.

00:03:35.288 --> 00:03:38.527
Organic chemistry,
scaled up in complexity,

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.873
gives us molecular biology,
which of course leads to life itself.

00:03:42.174 --> 00:03:44.151
So in a way, it's sort of not surprising.

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:45.389
It's almost trivial.

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:49.633
You say, "Well, of course life ultimately
must depend of quantum mechanics."

00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:52.531
But so does everything else.

00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:56.170
So does all inanimate matter,
made up of trillions of atoms.

00:03:56.501 --> 00:04:01.379
Ultimately, there's a quantum level

00:04:01.403 --> 00:04:03.586
where we have to delve into
this weirdness.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.026
But in everyday life,
we can forget about it.

00:04:06.404 --> 00:04:09.603
Because once you put together
trillions of atoms,

00:04:09.627 --> 00:04:12.242
that quantum weirdness
just dissolves away.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:17.857
Quantum biology isn't about this.

00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:20.437
Quantum biology isn't this obvious.

00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:24.690
Of course quantum mechanics
underpins life at some molecular level.

00:04:25.254 --> 00:04:31.258
Quantum biology is about looking
for the non-trivial --

00:04:31.282 --> 00:04:35.758
the counterintuitive ideas
in quantum mechanics --

00:04:35.782 --> 00:04:38.797
and to see if they do, indeed,
play an important role

00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:41.273
in describing the processes of life.

00:04:42.653 --> 00:04:47.873
Here is my perfect example
of the counterintuitiveness

00:04:47.897 --> 00:04:49.343
of the quantum world.

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:50.618
This is the quantum skier.

00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:53.282
He seems to be intact,
he seems to be perfectly healthy,

00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:57.433
and yet, he seems to have gone around
both sides of that tree at the same time.

00:04:57.457 --> 00:04:59.120
Well, if you saw tracks like that

00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:01.453
you'd guess it was some
sort of stunt, of course.

00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:04.068
But in the quantum world,
this happens all the time.

00:05:04.864 --> 00:05:07.890
Particles can multitask,
they can be in two places at once.

00:05:07.914 --> 00:05:10.242
They can do more than one thing
at the same time.

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:12.909
Particles can behave
like spread-out waves.

00:05:13.298 --> 00:05:14.897
It's almost like magic.

00:05:15.538 --> 00:05:18.287
Physicists and chemists have had
nearly a century

00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:20.957
of trying to get used to this weirdness.

00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:22.795
I don't blame the biologists

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.454
for not having to or wanting
to learn quantum mechanics.

00:05:25.478 --> 00:05:28.676
You see, this weirdness is very delicate;

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.150
and we physicists work very hard
to maintain it in our labs.

00:05:33.174 --> 00:05:37.378
We cool our system down
to near absolute zero,

00:05:37.402 --> 00:05:39.347
we carry out our experiments in vacuums,

00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:42.898
we try and isolate it
from any external disturbance.

00:05:43.602 --> 00:05:48.680
That's very different from the warm,
messy, noisy environment of a living cell.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.747
Biology itself, if you think of
molecular biology,

00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:56.228
seems to have done very well
in describing all the processes of life

00:05:56.252 --> 00:05:58.738
in terms of chemistry --
chemical reactions.

00:05:58.762 --> 00:06:03.612
And these are reductionist,
deterministic chemical reactions,

00:06:03.636 --> 00:06:08.750
showing that, essentially, life is made
of the same stuff as everything else,

00:06:08.774 --> 00:06:11.834
and if we can forget about quantum
mechanics in the macro world,

00:06:11.858 --> 00:06:15.104
then we should be able to forget
about it in biology, as well.

00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:19.070
Well, one man begged
to differ with this idea.

00:06:20.062 --> 00:06:23.531
Erwin Schrödinger,
of Schrödinger's Cat fame,

00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:24.872
was an Austrian physicist.

00:06:24.896 --> 00:06:28.079
He was one of the founders
of quantum mechanics in the 1920s.

00:06:28.663 --> 00:06:31.370
In 1944, he wrote a book
called "What is Life?"

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:33.570
It was tremendously influential.

00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:36.475
It influenced Francis Crick
and James Watson,

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:39.022
the discoverers of the double-helix
structure of DNA.

00:06:39.343 --> 00:06:43.011
To paraphrase a description
in the book, he says:

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:48.821
At the molecular level,
living organisms have a certain order,

00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:52.077
a structure to them that's very different

00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:56.837
from the random thermodynamic jostling
of atoms and molecules

00:06:56.861 --> 00:07:00.567
in inanimate matter
of the same complexity.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:06.518
In fact, living matter seems to behave
in this order, in a structure,

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:10.376
just like inanimate matter
cooled down to near absolute zero,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.433
where quantum effects
play a very important role.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.440
There's something special
about the structure -- the order --

00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:20.024
inside a living cell.

00:07:20.048 --> 00:07:25.341
So, Schrödinger speculated that maybe
quantum mechanics plays a role in life.

00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:29.521
It's a very speculative,
far-reaching idea,

00:07:29.545 --> 00:07:32.418
and it didn't really go very far.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.069
But as I mentioned at the start,

00:07:35.093 --> 00:07:37.892
in the last 10 years, there have been
experiments emerging,

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:41.971
showing where some of these
certain phenomena in biology

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:43.758
do seem to require quantum mechanics.

00:07:43.782 --> 00:07:46.905
I want to share with you
just a few of the exciting ones.

00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:51.922
This is one of the best-known
phenomena in the quantum world,

00:07:51.946 --> 00:07:53.647
quantum tunneling.

00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:58.060
The box on the left shows
the wavelike, spread-out distribution

00:07:58.084 --> 00:08:00.845
of a quantum entity --
a particle, like an electron,

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:04.506
which is not a little ball
bouncing off a wall.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:09.269
It's a wave that has a certain probability
of being able to permeate

00:08:09.293 --> 00:08:12.699
through a solid wall, like a phantom
leaping through to the other side.

00:08:12.723 --> 00:08:16.821
You can see a faint smudge of light
in the right-hand box.

00:08:17.773 --> 00:08:22.385
Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle
can hit an impenetrable barrier,

00:08:22.409 --> 00:08:24.869
and yet somehow, as though by magic,

00:08:24.893 --> 00:08:27.337
disappear from one side
and reappear on the other.

00:08:27.658 --> 00:08:31.909
The nicest way of explaining it is
if you want to throw a ball over a wall,

00:08:31.933 --> 00:08:35.510
you have to give it enough energy
to get over the top of the wall.

00:08:35.534 --> 00:08:38.592
In the quantum world,
you don't have to throw it over the wall,

00:08:38.616 --> 00:08:42.023
you can throw it at the wall,
and there's a certain non-zero probability

00:08:42.047 --> 00:08:45.370
that it'll disappear on your side,
and reappear on the other.

00:08:45.394 --> 00:08:47.072
This isn't speculation, by the way.

00:08:47.096 --> 00:08:50.492
We're happy -- well, "happy"
is not the right word --

00:08:50.516 --> 00:08:52.561
(Laughter)

00:08:52.585 --> 00:08:54.203
we are familiar with this.

00:08:54.227 --> 00:08:56.972
(Laughter)

00:08:56.996 --> 00:08:59.290
Quantum tunneling
takes place all the time;

00:08:59.314 --> 00:09:01.981
in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.

00:09:02.655 --> 00:09:04.164
The particles fuse together,

00:09:04.188 --> 00:09:07.886
and the Sun turns hydrogen
into helium through quantum tunneling.

00:09:09.464 --> 00:09:14.684
Back in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered
that quantum tunneling also takes place

00:09:14.708 --> 00:09:15.900
inside living cells.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:22.556
Enzymes, those workhorses of life,
the catalysts of chemical reactions --

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.746
enzymes are biomolecules that speed up
chemical reactions in living cells,

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.473
by many, many orders of magnitude.

00:09:28.497 --> 00:09:31.281
And it's always been a mystery
how they do this.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:32.839
Well, it was discovered

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:37.715
that one of the tricks that enzymes
have evolved to make use of,

00:09:37.739 --> 00:09:42.967
is by transferring subatomic particles,
like electrons and indeed protons,

00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:47.652
from one part of a molecule
to another via quantum tunneling.

00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:51.184
It's efficient, it's fast,
it can disappear --

00:09:51.208 --> 00:09:54.319
a proton can disappear from one place,
and reappear on the other.

00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:55.972
Enzymes help this take place.

00:09:56.548 --> 00:09:59.231
This is research that's been
carried out back in the 80s,

00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:03.292
particularly by a group
in Berkeley, Judith Klinman.

00:10:03.316 --> 00:10:05.521
Other groups in the UK
have now also confirmed

00:10:05.545 --> 00:10:06.956
that enzymes really do this.

00:10:09.048 --> 00:10:11.597
Research carried out by my group --

00:10:11.621 --> 00:10:14.055
so as I mentioned,
I'm a nuclear physicist,

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.134
but I've realized I've got these tools
of using quantum mechanics

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:22.243
in atomic nuclei, and so can apply
those tools in other areas as well.

00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:25.214
One question we asked

00:10:25.238 --> 00:10:29.536
is whether quantum tunneling
plays a role in mutations in DNA.

00:10:29.843 --> 00:10:33.503
Again, this is not a new idea;
it goes all the way back to the early 60s.

00:10:33.527 --> 00:10:36.488
The two strands of DNA,
the double-helix structure,

00:10:36.512 --> 00:10:39.335
are held together by rungs;
it's like a twisted ladder.

00:10:39.359 --> 00:10:42.866
And those rungs of the ladder
are hydrogen bonds --

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.680
protons, that act as the glue
between the two strands.

00:10:46.704 --> 00:10:51.454
So if you zoom in, what they're doing
is holding these large molecules --

00:10:51.478 --> 00:10:53.085
nucleotides -- together.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.280
Zoom in a bit more.

00:10:55.304 --> 00:10:57.220
So, this a computer simulation.

00:10:57.855 --> 00:11:01.397
The two white balls
in the middle are protons,

00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:03.720
and you can see that
it's a double hydrogen bond.

00:11:03.744 --> 00:11:07.058
One prefers to sit on one side;
the other, on the other side

00:11:07.082 --> 00:11:11.640
of the two strands of the vertical lines
going down, which you can't see.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.805
It can happen that
these two protons can hop over.

00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:17.265
Watch the two white balls.

00:11:17.748 --> 00:11:19.746
They can jump over to the other side.

00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:25.885
If the two strands of DNA then separate,
leading to the process of replication,

00:11:25.909 --> 00:11:29.108
and the two protons
are in the wrong positions,

00:11:29.132 --> 00:11:30.895
this can lead to a mutation.

00:11:31.204 --> 00:11:33.076
This has been known for half a century.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.443
The question is: How likely
are they to do that,

00:11:35.467 --> 00:11:37.845
and if they do, how do they do it?

00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:40.888
Do they jump across,
like the ball going over the wall?

00:11:40.912 --> 00:11:44.414
Or can they quantum-tunnel across,
even if they don't have enough energy?

00:11:45.089 --> 00:11:49.341
Early indications suggest that
quantum tunneling can play a role here.

00:11:49.365 --> 00:11:51.489
We still don't know yet
how important it is;

00:11:51.513 --> 00:11:53.305
this is still an open question.

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:55.349
It's speculative,

00:11:55.373 --> 00:11:58.016
but it's one of those questions
that is so important

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.486
that if quantum mechanics
plays a role in mutations,

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.809
surely this must have big implications,

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:05.527
to understand certain types of mutations,

00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:09.307
possibly even those that lead
to turning a cell cancerous.

00:12:10.803 --> 00:12:16.102
Another example of quantum mechanics
in biology is quantum coherence,

00:12:16.126 --> 00:12:18.479
in one of the most
important processes in biology,

00:12:18.503 --> 00:12:22.444
photosynthesis: plants
and bacteria taking sunlight,

00:12:22.468 --> 00:12:25.422
and using that energy to create biomass.

00:12:26.215 --> 00:12:30.367
Quantum coherence is the idea
of quantum entities multitasking.

00:12:30.912 --> 00:12:32.516
It's the quantum skier.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.492
It's an object that behaves like a wave,

00:12:35.516 --> 00:12:38.418
so that it doesn't just move
in one direction or the other,

00:12:38.442 --> 00:12:41.762
but can follow multiple pathways
at the same time.

00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:46.624
Some years ago,
the world of science was shocked

00:12:46.648 --> 00:12:50.232
when a paper was published
showing experimental evidence

00:12:50.256 --> 00:12:54.032
that quantum coherence
takes place inside bacteria,

00:12:54.056 --> 00:12:55.742
carrying out photosynthesis.

00:12:55.766 --> 00:12:58.830
The idea is that the photon,
the particle of light, the sunlight,

00:12:58.854 --> 00:13:02.198
the quantum of light
captured by a chlorophyll molecule,

00:13:02.222 --> 00:13:04.813
is then delivered to what's called
the reaction center,

00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:06.901
where it can be turned into
chemical energy.

00:13:06.925 --> 00:13:09.573
And in getting there,
it doesn't just follow one route;

00:13:09.597 --> 00:13:11.812
it follows multiple pathways at once,

00:13:11.836 --> 00:13:16.173
to optimize the most efficient way
of reaching the reaction center

00:13:16.197 --> 00:13:17.918
without dissipating as waste heat.

00:13:19.228 --> 00:13:22.537
Quantum coherence taking place
inside a living cell.

00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:24.681
A remarkable idea,

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:30.940
and yet evidence is growing almost weekly,
with new papers coming out,

00:13:30.964 --> 00:13:33.176
confirming that this
does indeed take place.

00:13:33.555 --> 00:13:38.294
My third and final example
is the most beautiful, wonderful idea.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:42.381
It's also still very speculative,
but I have to share it with you.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:47.017
The European robin
migrates from Scandinavia

00:13:47.041 --> 00:13:49.676
down to the Mediterranean, every autumn,

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.073
and like a lot of other
marine animals and even insects,

00:13:53.097 --> 00:13:57.397
they navigate by sensing
the Earth's magnetic field.

00:13:58.968 --> 00:14:01.395
Now, the Earth's magnetic field
is very, very weak;

00:14:01.419 --> 00:14:03.499
it's 100 times weaker
than a fridge magnet,

00:14:03.523 --> 00:14:09.124
and yet it affects the chemistry --
somehow -- within a living organism.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:13.738
That's not in doubt --
a German couple of ornithologists,

00:14:13.762 --> 00:14:18.022
Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko,
in the 1970s, confirmed that indeed,

00:14:18.046 --> 00:14:22.023
the robin does find its way by somehow
sensing the Earth's magnetic field,

00:14:22.047 --> 00:14:25.374
to give it directional information --
a built-in compass.

00:14:25.398 --> 00:14:27.647
The puzzle, the mystery was:
How does it do it?

00:14:28.351 --> 00:14:31.381
Well, the only theory in town --

00:14:31.405 --> 00:14:34.841
we don't know if it's the correct theory,
but the only theory in town --

00:14:34.865 --> 00:14:37.849
is that it does it via something
called quantum entanglement.

00:14:38.567 --> 00:14:40.941
Inside the robin's retina --

00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:45.197
I kid you not -- inside the robin's retina
is a protein called cryptochrome,

00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:46.601
which is light-sensitive.

00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:50.564
Within cryptochrome, a pair of electrons
are quantum-entangled.

00:14:50.588 --> 00:14:53.820
Now, quantum entanglement
is when two particles are far apart,

00:14:53.844 --> 00:14:56.678
and yet somehow remain
in contact with each other.

00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:58.437
Even Einstein hated this idea;

00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:00.500
he called it "spooky action
at a distance."

00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:02.405
(Laughter)

00:15:02.429 --> 00:15:05.872
So if Einstein doesn't like it,
then we can all be uncomfortable with it.

00:15:05.896 --> 00:15:08.749
Two quantum-entangled electrons
within a single molecule

00:15:08.773 --> 00:15:10.244
dance a delicate dance

00:15:10.268 --> 00:15:12.809
that is very sensitive
to the direction the bird flies

00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:14.364
in the Earth's magnetic field.

00:15:14.848 --> 00:15:17.458
We don't know if it's
the correct explanation,

00:15:17.482 --> 00:15:22.026
but wow, wouldn't it be exciting
if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate?

00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:25.790
Quantum biology is still in it infancy.

00:15:25.814 --> 00:15:29.298
It's still speculative.

00:15:29.742 --> 00:15:33.591
But I believe it's built on solid science.

00:15:33.917 --> 00:15:37.726
I also think that
in the coming decade or so,

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:42.591
we're going to start to see
that actually, it pervades life --

00:15:42.615 --> 00:15:47.211
that life has evolved tricks
that utilize the quantum world.

00:15:48.026 --> 00:15:49.454
Watch this space.

00:15:49.478 --> 00:15:50.635
Thank you.

00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:52.861
(Applause)
