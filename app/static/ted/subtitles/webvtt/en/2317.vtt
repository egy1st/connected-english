00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:03.271
The child's symptoms begin

00:00:03.295 --> 00:00:06.932
with mild fever, headache, muscle pains,

00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:09.043
followed by vomiting and diarrhea,

00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:13.167
then bleeding from the mouth,
nose and gums.

00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:19.100
Death follows in the form of organ failure
from low blood pressure.

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:21.084
Sounds familiar?

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:24.191
If you're thinking this is Ebola,

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:26.092
actually, in this case, it's not.

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:31.931
It's an extreme form of dengue fever,
a mosquito-born disease

00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:36.016
which also does not have
an effective therapy or a vaccine,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.299
and kills 22,000 people each year.

00:00:40.018 --> 00:00:42.894
That is actually twice
the number of people

00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:44.947
that have been killed by Ebola

00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:48.010
in the nearly four decades
that we've known about it.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.439
As for measles, so much
in the news recently,

00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:56.285
the death toll is actually tenfold higher.

00:00:57.578 --> 00:00:59.349
Yet for the last year,

00:00:59.373 --> 00:01:04.114
it has been Ebola that has stolen
all of the headlines and the fear.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.856
Clearly, there is something
deeply rooted about it,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.759
something which scares us
and fascinates us

00:01:10.783 --> 00:01:12.355
more than other diseases.

00:01:12.896 --> 00:01:14.490
But what is it, exactly?

00:01:15.357 --> 00:01:17.586
Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.087
but if you do, the risk
of a horrible death is high.

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:22.849
Why?

00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:27.689
Because right now, we don't have any
effective therapy or vaccine available.

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.276
And so, that's the clue.

00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:32.652
We may have it someday.

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:36.780
So we rightfully fear Ebola,

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:41.222
because it doesn't kill
as many people as other diseases.

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:47.246
In fact, it's much less transmissible
than viruses such as flu or measles.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.088
We fear Ebola because of the fact
that it kills us and we can't treat it.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:56.500
We fear the certain inevitability
that comes with Ebola.

00:01:56.524 --> 00:02:02.102
Ebola has this inevitability
that seems to defy modern medical science.

00:02:02.507 --> 00:02:04.261
But wait a second, why is that?

00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:07.607
We've known about Ebola since 1976.

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:10.108
We've known what it's capable of.

00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:12.762
We've had ample opportunity to study it

00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:15.174
in the 24 outbreaks that have occurred.

00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:19.967
And in fact, we've actually had
vaccine candidates available now

00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:21.348
for more than a decade.

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:26.295
Why is that those vaccines
are just going into clinical trials now?

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.764
This goes to the fundamental
problem we have

00:02:29.788 --> 00:02:32.792
with vaccine development
for infectious diseases.

00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:34.956
It goes something like this:

00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:38.786
The people most at risk for these diseases

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.969
are also the ones least able
to pay for vaccines.

00:02:43.858 --> 00:02:47.257
This leaves little in the way
of market incentives

00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:50.245
for manufacturers to develop vaccines,

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.989
unless there are large numbers of people
who are at risk in wealthy countries.

00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:57.902
It's simply too commercially risky.

00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:03.408
As for Ebola, there is absolutely
no market at all,

00:03:03.432 --> 00:03:09.060
so the only reason we have two vaccines
in late-stage clinical trials now,

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:11.748
is actually because
of a somewhat misguided fear.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.744
Ebola was relatively ignored

00:03:15.768 --> 00:03:20.309
until September 11
and the anthrax attacks,

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.867
when all of a sudden,
people perceived Ebola

00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:25.064
as, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon.

00:03:25.485 --> 00:03:29.607
Why is it that the Ebola vaccine
wasn't fully developed at this point?

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:32.763
Well, partially, because
it was really difficult --

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:35.436
or thought to be difficult --
to weaponize the virus,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.585
but mainly because
of the financial risk in developing it.

00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:42.822
And this is really the point.

00:03:43.718 --> 00:03:46.238
The sad reality is, we develop vaccines

00:03:46.262 --> 00:03:50.134
not based upon the risk
the pathogen poses to people,

00:03:50.158 --> 00:03:54.268
but on how economically risky it is
to develop these vaccines.

00:03:54.887 --> 00:03:57.796
Vaccine development
is expensive and complicated.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.891
It can cost hundreds
of millions of dollars

00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:04.223
to take even a well-known antigen
and turn it into a viable vaccine.

00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:07.455
Fortunately for diseases like Ebola,

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.869
there are things we can do
to remove some of these barriers.

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:14.933
The first is to recognize
when there's a complete market failure.

00:04:15.314 --> 00:04:18.348
In that case, if we want vaccines,

00:04:18.372 --> 00:04:23.381
we have to provide incentives
or some type of subsidy.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:28.537
We also need to do a better job
at being able to figure out

00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:30.919
which are the diseases
that most threaten us.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.175
By creating capabilities within countries,
we then create the ability

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.816
for those countries to create
epidemiological and laboratory networks

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.109
which are capable of collecting
and categorizing these pathogens.

00:04:46.117 --> 00:04:48.379
The data from that then can be used

00:04:48.403 --> 00:04:51.682
to understand the geographic
and genetic diversity,

00:04:51.706 --> 00:04:54.342
which then can be used
to help us understand

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:58.009
how these are being changed
immunologically,

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:00.357
and what type of reactions they promote.

00:05:01.198 --> 00:05:03.525
So these are the things that can be done,

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:07.233
but to do this, if we want to deal
with a complete market failure,

00:05:07.257 --> 00:05:12.681
we have to change the way
we view and prevent infectious diseases.

00:05:12.705 --> 00:05:16.892
We have to stop waiting
until we see evidence

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:21.720
of a disease becoming a global threat
before we consider it as one.

00:05:22.617 --> 00:05:24.856
So, for Ebola,

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.771
the paranoid fear
of an infectious disease,

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:33.517
followed by a few cases
transported to wealthy countries,

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:36.141
led the global community to come together,

00:05:36.165 --> 00:05:39.670
and with the work
of dedicated vaccine companies,

00:05:39.694 --> 00:05:41.360
we now have these:

00:05:42.465 --> 00:05:48.472
Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials
in the Ebola countries --

00:05:48.496 --> 00:05:54.001
(Applause)

00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:58.009
and a pipeline of vaccines
that are following behind.

00:05:58.763 --> 00:06:01.855
Every year, we spend billions of dollars,

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.952
keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines
permanently patrolling the oceans

00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:10.967
to protect us from a threat
that almost certainly will never happen.

00:06:11.527 --> 00:06:14.463
And yet, we spend virtually nothing

00:06:14.487 --> 00:06:19.514
to prevent something as tangible
and evolutionarily certain

00:06:19.538 --> 00:06:21.716
as epidemic infectious diseases.

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.904
And make no mistake about it --
it's not a question of "if," but "when."

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:29.840
These bugs are going to continue to evolve

00:06:29.864 --> 00:06:31.867
and they're going to threaten the world.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.624
And vaccines are our best defense.

00:06:35.108 --> 00:06:39.417
So if we want to be able to prevent
epidemics like Ebola,

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:43.887
we need to take on the risk
of investing in vaccine development

00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:45.949
and in stockpile creation.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.385
And we need to view this, then,
as the ultimate deterrent --

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.529
something we make sure is available,

00:06:53.553 --> 00:06:57.192
but at the same time,
praying we never have to use it.

00:06:57.621 --> 00:06:58.772
Thank you.

00:06:58.796 --> 00:07:03.074
(Applause)
