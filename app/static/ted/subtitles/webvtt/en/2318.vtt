00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:05.975
Over a million people are killed
each year in disasters.

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:11.233
Two and a half million people
will be permanently disabled or displaced,

00:00:11.257 --> 00:00:15.181
and the communities will take
20 to 30 years to recover

00:00:15.205 --> 00:00:17.606
and billions of economic losses.

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:23.425
If you can reduce
the initial response by one day,

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.976
you can reduce the overall recovery

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.808
by a thousand days, or three years.

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:31.585
See how that works?

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.459
If the initial responders
can get in, save lives,

00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:36.999
mitigate whatever flooding
danger there is,

00:00:37.023 --> 00:00:39.307
that means the other groups can get in

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:42.316
to restore the water,
the roads, the electricity,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.456
which means then the construction people,
the insurance agents,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.094
all of them can get in
to rebuild the houses,

00:00:48.118 --> 00:00:51.106
which then means
you can restore the economy,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.003
and maybe even make it better
and more resilient to the next disaster.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.695
A major insurance company told me

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.831
that if they can get a homeowner's claim
processed one day earlier,

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:06.975
it'll make a difference of six months

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:09.239
in that person getting
their home repaired.

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:12.447
And that's why I do disaster robotics --

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:16.970
because robots can
make a disaster go away faster.

00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:20.322
Now, you've already seen
a couple of these.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.066
These are the UAVs.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.951
These are two types of UAVs:

00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:25.840
a rotorcraft, or hummingbird;

00:01:25.864 --> 00:01:27.934
a fixed-wing, a hawk.

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.348
And they're used extensively since 2005 --

00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:32.547
Hurricane Katrina.

00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:35.895
Let me show you how this hummingbird,
this rotorcraft, works.

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:38.975
Fantastic for structural engineers.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.419
Being able to see damage from angles you
can't get from binoculars on the ground

00:01:43.443 --> 00:01:44.753
or from a satellite image,

00:01:44.777 --> 00:01:47.969
or anything flying at a higher angle.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.902
But it's not just structural engineers
and insurance people who need this.

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:55.393
You've got things
like this fixed-wing, this hawk.

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:58.688
Now, this hawk can be used
for geospatial surveys.

00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:01.561
That's where you're
pulling imagery together

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:03.410
and getting 3D reconstruction.

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:07.508
We used both of these at the Oso mudslides
up in Washington State,

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:09.731
because the big problem

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:12.913
was geospatial and hydrological
understanding of the disaster --

00:02:12.937 --> 00:02:14.183
not the search and rescue.

00:02:14.207 --> 00:02:16.526
The search and rescue teams
had it under control

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.028
and knew what they were doing.

00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:21.922
The bigger problem was that river
and mudslide might wipe them out

00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:23.440
and flood the responders.

00:02:23.464 --> 00:02:27.206
And not only was it challenging
to the responders and property damage,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.509
it's also putting at risk
the future of salmon fishing

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:32.249
along that part of Washington State.

00:02:32.273 --> 00:02:34.749
So they needed to understand
what was going on.

00:02:34.773 --> 00:02:37.382
In seven hours, going from Arlington,

00:02:37.406 --> 00:02:42.220
driving from the Incident Command Post
to the site, flying the UAVs,

00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:45.975
processing the data, driving back
to Arlington command post --

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.405
seven hours.

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.963
We gave them in seven hours
data that they could take

00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:54.737
only two to three days
to get any other way --

00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:56.598
and at higher resolution.

00:02:57.064 --> 00:02:58.437
It's a game changer.

00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:01.842
And don't just think about the UAVs.

00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:04.494
I mean, they are sexy -- but remember,

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:07.854
80 percent of the world's
population lives by water,

00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:10.742
and that means our critical
infrastructure is underwater --

00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:14.052
the parts that we can't get to,
like the bridges and things like that.

00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:16.668
And that's why we have
unmanned marine vehicles,

00:03:16.692 --> 00:03:21.144
one type of which you've already met,
which is SARbot, a square dolphin.

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:23.864
It goes underwater and uses sonar.

00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:26.221
Well, why are marine vehicles so important

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:29.369
and why are they very, very important?

00:03:29.393 --> 00:03:30.909
They get overlooked.

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:33.335
Think about the Japanese tsunami --

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.325
400 miles of coastland totally devastated,

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.045
twice the amount of coastland devastated
by Hurricane Katrina in the United States.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.925
You're talking about your bridges,
your pipelines, your ports -- wiped out.

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.561
And if you don't have a port,

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:50.831
you don't have a way
to get in enough relief supplies

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.076
to support a population.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.672
That was a huge problem
at the Haiti earthquake.

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:57.687
So we need marine vehicles.

00:03:57.711 --> 00:04:00.142
Now, let's look at a viewpoint
from the SARbot

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:01.637
of what they were seeing.

00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:03.907
We were working on a fishing port.

00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:09.647
We were able to reopen that fishing port,
using her sonar, in four hours.

00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.324
That fishing port was told
it was going to be six months

00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:15.054
before they could get
a manual team of divers in,

00:04:15.078 --> 00:04:17.765
and it was going to take
the divers two weeks.

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.083
They were going to miss
the fall fishing season,

00:04:20.107 --> 00:04:24.333
which was the major economy for that part,
which is kind of like their Cape Cod.

00:04:24.357 --> 00:04:26.625
UMVs, very important.

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:29.897
But you know, all the robots
I've shown you have been small,

00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:33.698
and that's because robots
don't do things that people do.

00:04:33.722 --> 00:04:35.975
They go places people can't go.

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.975
And a great example of that is Bujold.

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.975
Unmanned ground vehicles
are particularly small,

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:43.317
so Bujold --

00:04:43.341 --> 00:04:44.849
(Laughter)

00:04:44.873 --> 00:04:46.056
Say hello to Bujold.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.764
(Laughter)

00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:52.975
Bujold was used extensively
at the World Trade Center

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.379
to go through Towers 1, 2 and 4.

00:04:55.403 --> 00:05:00.048
You're climbing into the rubble,
rappelling down, going deep in spaces.

00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:04.631
And just to see the World Trade Center
from Bujold's viewpoint, look at this.

00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:09.724
You're talking about a disaster
where you can't fit a person or a dog --

00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:11.890
and it's on fire.

00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:15.648
The only hope of getting
to a survivor way in the basement,

00:05:15.672 --> 00:05:17.867
you have to go through things
that are on fire.

00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:22.395
It was so hot, on one of the robots,
the tracks began to melt and come off.

00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:25.949
Robots don't replace people or dogs,

00:05:25.973 --> 00:05:28.494
or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins.

00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:30.554
They do things new.

00:05:30.578 --> 00:05:36.267
They assist the responders,
the experts, in new and innovative ways.

00:05:36.291 --> 00:05:40.720
The biggest problem is not
making the robots smaller, though.

00:05:40.744 --> 00:05:42.975
It's not making them more heat-resistant.

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:44.756
It's not making more sensors.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.390
The biggest problem is the data,
the informatics,

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:52.450
because these people need to get
the right data at the right time.

00:05:52.474 --> 00:05:57.975
So wouldn't it be great if we could have
experts immediately access the robots

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.975
without having to waste any time
of driving to the site,

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.932
so whoever's there,
use their robots over the Internet.

00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:05.338
Well, let's think about that.

00:06:05.362 --> 00:06:08.734
Let's think about a chemical
train derailment in a rural county.

00:06:08.758 --> 00:06:12.600
What are the odds that the experts,
your chemical engineer,

00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:14.486
your railroad transportation engineers,

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.371
have been trained on whatever UAV
that particular county happens to have?

00:06:19.395 --> 00:06:20.928
Probably, like, none.

00:06:20.952 --> 00:06:23.342
So we're using these kinds of interfaces

00:06:23.366 --> 00:06:27.706
to allow people to use the robots
without knowing what robot they're using,

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.516
or even if they're using a robot or not.

00:06:32.252 --> 00:06:38.286
What the robots give you,
what they give the experts, is data.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.890
The problem becomes:
who gets what data when?

00:06:41.914 --> 00:06:45.807
One thing to do is to ship
all the information to everybody

00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:47.343
and let them sort it out.

00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:51.223
Well, the problem with that
is it overwhelms the networks,

00:06:51.247 --> 00:06:54.933
and worse yet, it overwhelms
the cognitive abilities

00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:59.466
of each of the people trying to get
that one nugget of information

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.295
they need to make the decision
that's going to make the difference.

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:07.093
So we need to think
about those kinds of challenges.

00:07:07.117 --> 00:07:08.382
So it's the data.

00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:10.642
Going back to the World Trade Center,

00:07:10.666 --> 00:07:14.975
we tried to solve that problem
by just recording the data from Bujold

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.975
only when she was deep in the rubble,

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:19.563
because that's what the USAR team
said they wanted.

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.111
What we didn't know at the time

00:07:23.135 --> 00:07:25.733
was that the civil engineers
would have loved,

00:07:25.757 --> 00:07:29.975
needed the data as we recorded
the box beams, the serial numbers,

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:32.618
the locations, as we went into the rubble.

00:07:33.343 --> 00:07:34.810
We lost valuable data.

00:07:34.834 --> 00:07:37.213
So the challenge is getting all the data

00:07:37.237 --> 00:07:39.417
and getting it to the right people.

00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:41.518
Now, here's another reason.

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:43.853
We've learned that some buildings --

00:07:43.877 --> 00:07:47.149
things like schools,
hospitals, city halls --

00:07:47.173 --> 00:07:51.192
get inspected four times
by different agencies

00:07:51.216 --> 00:07:53.466
throughout the response phases.

00:07:54.156 --> 00:07:57.425
Now, we're looking, if we can get
the data from the robots to share,

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:02.299
not only can we do things like
compress that sequence of phases

00:08:02.323 --> 00:08:03.976
to shorten the response time,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.358
but now we can begin
to do the response in parallel.

00:08:08.382 --> 00:08:09.761
Everybody can see the data.

00:08:09.785 --> 00:08:11.247
We can shorten it that way.

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:15.405
So really, "disaster robotics"
is a misnomer.

00:08:16.227 --> 00:08:18.122
It's not about the robots.

00:08:18.146 --> 00:08:20.028
It's about the data.

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:23.763
(Applause)

00:08:23.787 --> 00:08:25.744
So my challenge to you:

00:08:25.768 --> 00:08:28.068
the next time you hear about a disaster,

00:08:28.092 --> 00:08:29.417
look for the robots.

00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:32.566
They may be underground,
they may be underwater,

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.284
they may be in the sky,

00:08:34.308 --> 00:08:36.273
but they should be there.

00:08:36.297 --> 00:08:37.464
Look for the robots,

00:08:37.488 --> 00:08:40.235
because robots are coming to the rescue.

00:08:40.259 --> 00:08:45.920
(Applause)
