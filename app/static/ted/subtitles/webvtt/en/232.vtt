00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It was an incredible surprise to me

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Because, basically,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I work as a theoretical physicist.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I develop and test models of the Big Bang,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
using observational data.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I've been moonlighting for the last five years

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
helping with a project in Africa.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And, I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
People wonder, you know, "How do you have time to do this?" And so on.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And so it was simply astonishing to me

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So I thought I'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and why I lead this schizophrenic life.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, I was born in South Africa and my parents were imprisoned

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
for resisting the racist regime.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
When they were released, we left and we went as refugees to Kenya and Tanzania.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Both were very young countries then,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and full of hope for the future.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We had an amazing childhood. We didn't have any money,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
but we were outdoors most of the time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
like Kilimanjaro, Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Well, then we moved to London for high school.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And after that -- there's nothing much to say about that.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It was rather dull. But I came back to Africa

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
at the age of 17, as a volunteer teacher

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to Lesotho, which is a tiny country,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
surrounded at that time by apartheid South Africa.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, 80 percent of the men in Lesotho

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
worked in the mines over the border,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
in brutal conditions.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Nevertheless, I -- as I'm sure -- as a rather irritating young, white man

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
coming into their village, I was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But the kids were the best part.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The kids were amazing: extremely eager and often very bright.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And I'm just going to tell you one story,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
which got through to me.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And they weren't used to that.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But I took them outside one day and I said,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
"I want you to estimate the height of the building."

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
size it up with a finger, and make an estimate of the height.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But there was one little boy, very small for his age.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And he wasn't doing that. He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And so, I said -- I was annoyed -- I said, "What are you doing?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I want you to estimate the height of the building."

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
He said, "OK. I measured the height of a brick.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I counted the number of bricks and now I'm multiplying."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Well -- (Laughter) -- I hadn't thought of that one.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And many experiences like this happened to me.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Another one is that I met a miner. He was home on his three-month leave from the mines.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Sitting next to him one day, he said, "There's only one thing that I really loved at school.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And you know what it was? Shakespeare." And he recited some to me.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And these and many similar experiences convinced me

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that there are just tons of bright kids in Africa

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
-- inventive kids, intellectual kids --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and starved of opportunity.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And if Africa is going to get fixed, it's by them, not by us.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Well, after -- (Applause) -- that's the truth.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Well, after Lesotho, I traveled across Africa

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
before returning to England

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
-- so gray and depressing, in comparison.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And I went to Cambridge. And there, I fell for theoretical physics.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Well, I'm not going to explain this equation,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And, admittedly, it's in a very shorthand notation.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And it contains 18 free parameters,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
OK, which we have to fit to the data.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So it's not the final story,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
but it's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
about nature at the most basic level.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And apart from a few very important loose ends, which you've heard about here --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
like dark energy and dark matter --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
this equation describes,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
seems to describe everything about the universe and what's in it.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But there's one big puzzle remaining,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Tanzania, who's a wonderful Scottish lady

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
who I still stay in touch with.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And she's now in her 80s.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And when I try to explain my work to her, she waved away all the details, and she said,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
"Neil, there's only one question that really matters.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
What banged?" (Laughter)

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
"Everyone talks about the Big Bang. What banged?"

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And she's right. It's a question we've all been avoiding.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
The standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
full of a strange kind of energy

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
-- inflationary energy -- which blew it up.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
is completely unsolved.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Now, I worked on that theory for a while, with Stephen Hawking and others.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But then I began to explore another alternative.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
The alternative is that the Big Bang wasn't the beginning.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Perhaps the universe existed before the bang,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Well, this possibility is actually suggested

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
by the latest theories, the unified theories,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
which try to explain all those 18 free parameters

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in a single framework, which will hopefully predict all of them.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And I'll just share a cartoon of this idea here.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
It's all I can convey. According to these theories,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
there are extra dimensions of space, not just the three we're familiar with,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
but at every point in the room there are more dimensions.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And in particular, there's one rather strange one,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
in the most elegant unified theories we have.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
The strange one looks likes this:

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that we live in a three-dimensional world.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
We live in one of these worlds, and I can only show it as a sheet,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
but it's really three-dimensional.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And a tiny distance away, there's another sheet,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
also three-dimensional, and they're separated by a gap.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
The gap is very tiny, and I've blown it up so you can see it.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But it's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Well, I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Which is, what happens if these two, three-dimensional worlds

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
should actually collide?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And if they collide, it would look a lot like the Big Bang.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But it's slightly different than in the conventional picture.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
The conventional picture of the Big Bang is a point.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Everything comes out of a point;

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
you have infinite density. And all the equations break down.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
No hope of describing that.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
In this picture, you'll notice,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
the bang is extended. It's not a point.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
The density of matter is finite, and we have a chance

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So, to cut a long story short, we've explored this alternative.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
We've shown that it can fit

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
all of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
the fluctuations in the microwave background.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Furthermore, there's an experimental way

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to tell this theory, apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It involves gravitational waves.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And in this scenario, not only was the Big Bang not the beginning,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
as you can see from the picture,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
it can happen over and over again.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
It may be that we live in an endless universe,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
both in space and in time.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And there've been bangs in the past, and there will be bangs in the future.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And maybe we live in an endless universe.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Well, making and testing models of the universe

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
is, for me, the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
We need to make the best mathematical models we can,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
the most consistent ones.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And then we scrutinize them, logically and with data.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And we try to convince ourselves --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
we really try to convince ourselves they're wrong.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
That's progress: when we prove things wrong.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And gradually, we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
As I pursued my career, something was always gnawing away inside me.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
What about Africa?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
What about those kids I'd left behind?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Instead of developing, as we'd all hoped in the '60s,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
things had gotten worse.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Africa was gripped by poverty, disease and war.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
This is very graphically shown by the Worldmapper website and project.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And so the idea is to represent each country

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
on a map, but scale the area according to some quantity.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So here's just the standard area map of the world.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
By the way, Africa is very large.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And the next map now shows Africa's GDP in 1960,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
around the time of independence for many African states.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Now, this is 1990, and then 2002. And here's a projection for 2015.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Big changes are happening in the world,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
but they're not helping Africa.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
What about Africa's population? The population isn't out of proportion to its area,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
but Africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes:

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
malnutrition, simple infections and birth complications.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Then there's HIV/AIDS. And then there are deaths from war.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
OK, currently there are 45,000 people a month dying in the Congo,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
as a consequence of the war

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
there over coltan and diamonds and other things.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It's still going on.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
What about Africa's capacity to do something about these problems?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Well, here's the number of physicians in Africa.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Here's the number of people in higher education.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And here -- most shocking to me --

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
the number of scientific research papers coming out of Africa.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
It just doesn't exist scientifically.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa:

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
that all of the aid that's been given

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.000
has completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Well, the transition to democracy in South Africa in 1994

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
was literally a dream come true for many of us.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
My parents were both elected to the first parliament,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
alongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela. They were the only other couple.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And in 2001, I took a research leave to visit them.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And while I was busy working -- I was working on these colliding worlds, in the day.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
But I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000
especially mathematical skills, in industry, in government, in education.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
The ability to make and test models has become essential,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
not only to every single area of science today,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
but also to modern society itself.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And if you don't have math, you're not going to enter the modern age.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
So I had an idea. And the idea was very simple.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
The idea was to set up an African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, or AIMS.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And let's recruit students from the whole of Africa,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
bring them together with lecturers from all over the world,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and we'll try to give them a fantastic education.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Well, as a Cambridge professor, I had many contacts.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And to my astonishment, they backed me 100 percent.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
They said, "Go and do it,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and we'll come and lecture."

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
from these countries -- where they don't have any opportunities -- together

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
with the best lecturers in the world --

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
who I knew would come, because of the interest in Africa --

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and put them together and just let the sparks fly.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
So we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It's an 80-room Art Deco hotel from the 1920s.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
The area was kind of seedy, so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
It's a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and then put out the word:

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
we're going to start the best math institute in Africa

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
in this hotel.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Well, the new South Africa is a very exciting country.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And those of you who haven't been there, you should go.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
It's very, very interesting what's happening.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And we recruited wonderful staff,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
highly motivated staff.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
The other thing that's happened, which was good for us, is the Internet.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Even though the Internet is very expensive all over Africa,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
there are Internet cafes everywhere.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
to be successful -- and they're very ambitious.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
They want to be the next Einstein.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And so when word came out that AIMS was opening,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
it spread very quickly via e-mail and our website.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And we got lots of applicants.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Well, we designed AIMS as a 24-hour learning environment,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
You have to rethink, what is the university for?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And that's really exciting.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
So we designed it to have interactive teaching.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
No droning on at the chalkboard.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
We emphasize problem-solving, working in groups,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
every student discovering and maximizing their own potential

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and not chasing grades.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Everyone lives together in this hotel -- lecturers and students --

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 a.m.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
The students don't usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.m.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And then they're up again at eight in the morning.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Lectures, problem-solving and so on. It's an extraordinary place.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
We especially emphasize areas of great relevance to Africa's development,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
because, in those areas, scientists working in Africa will have a competitive advantage.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
They'll publish, be invited to conferences.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
They'll do well. They'll have successful careers.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And AIMS has done extremely well.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Here is a list of last year's graduates, graduated in June,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and what they're currently doing -- 48 of them.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And where they are is indicated over here.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And where they've gone. So these are all postgraduate students.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And they've all gone on to master's and Ph.D. degrees in excellent places.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Five students can be educated at AIMS

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
for the cost of educating one in the U.S. or Europe.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
But more important, the pan-African student body

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
is a continual source of strength, pride and commitment to Africa.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
We illustrate AIMS' progress by coloring in the countries of Africa.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
So here you can see behind this list.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
When a county is colored yellow, we've received an application;

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
orange, we've accepted an application; and green,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
a student has graduated.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
So there's 2005, -6, -7, -8.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:17.000
(Applause)

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
We're well on the way to achieving our initial goal.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
We had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And I'll just show you one.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Tendai Mugwagwa: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
I have a Bachelor of Science with an education degree.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I will be attending AIMS.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
My understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
You know, from physics to medicine,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
in particular, epidemiology and also mathematical modeling.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Neil Turok: So Tendai came to AIMS and did very well.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
And I'll let her take it from there.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
TM: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and I was a student at AIMS in 2003 and 2004.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
After leaving AIMS, I went on to do a master's in applied mathematics

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
After that, I came to the Netherlands

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
where I'm now doing a Ph.D. in theoretical immunology.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Professor: Tendai is working very independently.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
She communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So all in all I have a very good Ph.D. student from South Africa.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
So I'm happy she's here.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
NT: Another student in the first year of AIMS was Shehu.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
And he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And then entering university in northern Nigeria.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
And after AIMS, Shehu wanted to do high-energy physics,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
and he came to Cambridge.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
He's about to finish his Ph.D.,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
and he was filmed recently with someone you all know.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Shehu: And from there we will be able to,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
hopefully, make better predictions and then we compare it

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
to the graph and also make some predictions.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Stephen Hawking: That is nice.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
NT: Here are the current students at AIMS. There are 53 of them

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
from 20 different countries, including 20 women.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
So now I'm going to get to my TED business.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Well, we had a party. This is Africa --

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
we have good parties in Africa. And last month, they threw a surprise party for me.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Here's somebody you've seen already.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:20:02.000
(Applause)

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
I want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
So, we were having a party,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
as you can see they're completely eclipsing me at this point.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
This is Ezra. She's from Darfur.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
She's a physicist, and somehow stays smiling,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
in spite of everything going on back home.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
But she wants to continue in physics, and she's doing extremely well.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
This is Lydia. Lydia is the first ever woman

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
to graduate in mathematics in the Central African Republic.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And she's now at AIMS. (Applause)

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
So now let me get to our TED wish.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Well, it's not my TED wish; it's our wish, as you've already gathered.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
And our wish has two parts:

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
one is a dream and the other's a plan. OK.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Our TED dream is that the next Einstein will be African. (Applause)

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
In striving for the heights of creative genius,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
we want to give thousands of people the motivation,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
the encouragement and the courage

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
to obtain the high-level skills they need to help Africa.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Among them will be not only brilliant scientists --

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
I'm sure of that from what we've seen at AIMS --

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
they'll also be the African Gates, Brins and Pages of the future.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Well, I said we also have a plan. And our plan is quite simple.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
AIMS is now a proven model.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
And what we need to do is to replicate it.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
We want to roll out 15 AIMS centers in the next five years, all over Africa.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Each will have a pan-African student body,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
but specialize in a different area of science.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
We want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
as it does at AIMS.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And we want to add elements to the curriculum.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
The expanded AIMS will be a coherent pan-African institution,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
and its graduates will form a powerful network,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000
working together for peace and progress across the continent.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Over the last year,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
we've been visiting sites in Africa,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
looking at potential sites for new AIMS centers.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And here are the ones we've selected.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
And each of these centers has a strong local team,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
each is in a beautiful place, an interesting place,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
which international lecturers will be happy to visit.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
And our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Everyone wants an AIMS center in their country.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
And last November,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
the conference of all the African ministers of science and technology,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
held in Mombasa, called for a comprehensive plan to roll out AIMS.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
So we have political support right across the continent.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
It won't be easy.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
At every site there will be huge challenges.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Local scientists must play leading roles

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
and governments must be persuaded to buy in.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Conditions are very difficult,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.000
but we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made AIMS work.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
And we summarize them this way:

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
the institutes have got to be relevant, innovative,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
cost-effective and high quality. Why?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Because we want Africa to be rich.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Easy to remember the basic rules we need.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
So, just in ending, let me say the only people who can fix Africa

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
are talented young Africans.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
By unlocking and nurturing their creative potential,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
we can create a step change in Africa's future.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Over time, they will contribute to African development

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
and to science in ways we can only imagine.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Thank you.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:27.000
(Applause)
