WEBVTT

00:00:00.944 --> 00:00:05.315
When I was 14 years old,
I was interested in science --

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.824
fascinated by it,
excited to learn about it.

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.538
And I had a high school science teacher
who would say to the class,

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:15.751
"The girls don't have to listen to this."

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.205
Encouraging, yes.

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:19.316
(Laughter)

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.372
I chose not to listen --
but to that statement alone.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.417
So let me take you
to the Andes mountains in Chile,

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:32.970
500 kilometers, 300 miles
northeast of Santiago.

00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:37.474
It's very remote, it's very dry
and it's very beautiful.

00:00:38.087 --> 00:00:39.462
And there's not much there.

00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:42.126
There are condors, there are tarantulas,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.647
and at night, when the light dims,

00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:48.036
it reveals one of the darkest
skies on Earth.

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.456
It's kind of a magic place, the mountain.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.817
It's a wonderful combination
of very remote mountaintop

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:59.022
with exquisitely sophisticated technology.

00:00:59.508 --> 00:01:03.100
And our ancestors, for as long
as there's been recorded history,

00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:07.910
have looked at the night sky
and pondered the nature of our existence.

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:10.866
And we're no exception, our generation.

00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:14.632
The only difficulty is
that the night sky now is blocked

00:01:14.656 --> 00:01:16.506
by the glare of city lights.

00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:20.672
And so astronomers go
to these very remote mountaintops

00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:22.616
to view and to study the cosmos.

00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.100
So telescopes
are our window to the cosmos.

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:32.065
It's no exaggeration to say that
the Southern Hemisphere is going to be

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:35.504
the future of astronomy
for the 21st century.

00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:39.367
We have an array
of existing telescopes already,

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:41.423
in the Andes mountains in Chile,

00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:46.584
and that's soon to be joined by a really
sensational array of new capability.

00:01:46.608 --> 00:01:49.807
There will be two international groups
that are going to be building

00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:55.307
giant telescopes, sensitive
to optical radiation, as our eyes are.

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:57.540
There will be a survey telescope

00:01:57.564 --> 00:02:00.884
that will be scanning the sky
every few nights.

00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:02.892
There will be radio telescopes,

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:06.424
sensitive to long-wavelength
radio radiation.

00:02:06.448 --> 00:02:09.563
And then there will be
telescopes in space.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:12.484
There'll be a successor
to the Hubble Space Telescope;

00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:14.545
it's called the James Webb Telescope,

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.054
and it will be launched in 2018.

00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:18.784
There'll be a satellite called TESS

00:02:18.808 --> 00:02:22.181
that will discover planets
outside of our solar system.

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:26.889
For the last decade,
I've been leading a group --

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.130
a consortium -- international group,

00:02:29.154 --> 00:02:32.137
to build what will be, when it's finished,

00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:35.465
the largest optical
telescope in existence.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.145
It's called the Giant
Magellan Telescope, or GMT.

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:44.481
This telescope is going to have mirrors
that are 8.4 meters in diameter --

00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:45.667
each of the mirrors.

00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:47.330
That's almost 27 feet.

00:02:47.354 --> 00:02:51.826
So it dwarfs this stage -- maybe
out to the fourth row in this audience.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.874
Each of the seven mirrors
in this telescope

00:02:54.898 --> 00:02:58.682
will be almost 27 feet in diameter.

00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:02.634
Together, the seven mirrors
in this telescope will comprise

00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:04.699
80 feet in diameter.

00:03:04.723 --> 00:03:07.681
So, essentially the size
of this entire auditorium.

00:03:08.448 --> 00:03:12.094
The whole telescope will stand
about 43 meters high,

00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:14.808
and again, being in Rio,

00:03:14.832 --> 00:03:18.451
some of you have been to see
the statue of the giant Christ.

00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:20.304
The scale is comparable in height;

00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:23.565
in fact, it's smaller
than this telescope will be.

00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:27.280
It's comparable to the size
of the Statue of Liberty.

00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:31.770
And it's going to be housed
in an enclosure that's 22 stories --

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:33.693
60 meters high.

00:03:33.717 --> 00:03:36.719
But it's an unusual building
to protect this telescope.

00:03:36.743 --> 00:03:38.529
It will have open windows to the sky,

00:03:38.553 --> 00:03:40.901
be able to point and look at the sky,

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:43.553
and it will actually rotate on a base --

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:47.052
2,000 tons of rotating building.

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.552
The Giant Magellan Telescope
will have 10 times the resolution

00:03:52.576 --> 00:03:54.315
of the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:58.994
It will be 20 million times
more sensitive than the human eye.

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:05.729
And it may, for the first time ever,
be capable of finding life on planets

00:04:05.753 --> 00:04:07.763
outside of our solar system.

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.842
It's going to allow us to look back
at the first light in the universe --

00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:15.233
literally, the dawn of the cosmos.

00:04:15.257 --> 00:04:17.025
The cosmic dawn.

00:04:17.763 --> 00:04:21.517
It's a telescope that's
going to allow us to peer back,

00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:25.326
witness galaxies as they were
when they were actually assembling,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.691
the first black holes in the universe,
the first galaxies.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.298
Now, for thousands of years,
we have been studying the cosmos,

00:04:34.322 --> 00:04:36.976
we've been wondering
about our place in the universe.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.665
The ancient Greeks told us

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.171
that the Earth was the center
of the universe.

00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:44.821
Five hundred years ago,
Copernicus displaced the Earth,

00:04:44.845 --> 00:04:47.636
and put the Sun
at the heart of the cosmos.

00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:50.839
And as we've learned over the centuries,

00:04:50.863 --> 00:04:53.581
since Galileo Galilei,
the Italian scientist,

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:58.855
first turned, in that time, a two-inch,
very small telescope, to the sky,

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.894
every time we have built
larger telescopes,

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:04.117
we have learned something
about the universe;

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:06.967
we've made discoveries, without exception.

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:12.645
We've learned in the 20th century
that the universe is expanding

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.393
and that our own solar system
is not at the center of that expansion.

00:05:17.757 --> 00:05:23.036
We know now that the universe
is made of about 100 billion galaxies

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.710
that are visible to us,

00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:30.145
and each one of those galaxies
has 100 billion stars within it.

00:05:31.234 --> 00:05:34.096
So we're looking now
at the deepest image of the cosmos

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.619
that's ever been taken.

00:05:36.015 --> 00:05:38.833
It was taken using
the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:05:38.857 --> 00:05:43.747
and by pointing the telescope at what
was previously a blank region of sky,

00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:45.370
before the launch of Hubble.

00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:47.657
And if you can imagine this tiny area,

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:51.011
it's only one-fiftieth
of the size of the full moon.

00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:53.075
So, if you can imagine the full moon.

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:57.237
And there are now 10,000 galaxies
visible within that image.

00:05:57.782 --> 00:06:02.460
And the faintness of those images
and the tiny size is only a result

00:06:02.484 --> 00:06:06.891
of the fact that those galaxies
are so far away, the vast distances.

00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:09.848
And each of those galaxies
may contain within it

00:06:09.872 --> 00:06:14.881
a few billion or even hundreds
of billions of individual stars.

00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.610
Telescopes are like time machines.

00:06:17.634 --> 00:06:22.097
So the farther back we look in space,
the further back we see in time.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.656
And they're like light buckets --
literally, they collect light.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.914
So larger the bucket,
the larger the mirror we have,

00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:32.348
the more light we can see,
and the farther back we can view.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.881
So, we've learned in the last century

00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:38.839
that there are exotic objects
in the universe -- black holes.

00:06:38.863 --> 00:06:41.640
We've even learned
that there's dark matter and dark energy

00:06:41.664 --> 00:06:42.875
that we can't see.

00:06:43.218 --> 00:06:46.776
So you're looking now
at an actual image of dark matter.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.950
(Laughter)

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:50.617
You got it. Not all audiences get that.

00:06:50.641 --> 00:06:52.406
(Laughter)

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.154
So the way we infer
the presence of dark matter --

00:06:55.178 --> 00:06:59.873
we can't see it -- but there's
an unmistakable tug, due to gravity.

00:07:01.302 --> 00:07:04.680
We now can look out,
we see this sea of galaxies

00:07:04.704 --> 00:07:06.481
in a universe that's expanding.

00:07:06.862 --> 00:07:10.165
What I do myself is to measure
the expansion of the universe,

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:13.330
and one of the projects
that I carried out in the 1990s

00:07:13.354 --> 00:07:18.470
used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure
how fast the universe is expanding.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:23.322
We can now trace back to 14 billion years.

00:07:23.731 --> 00:07:28.067
We've learned over time
that stars have individual histories;

00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:31.020
that is, they have birth,
they have middle ages

00:07:31.044 --> 00:07:33.374
and some of them
even have dramatic deaths.

00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:39.944
So the embers from those stars actually
then form the new stars that we see,

00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:43.779
most of which turn out to have
planets going around them.

00:07:44.272 --> 00:07:48.307
And one of the really surprising results
in the last 20 years

00:07:48.331 --> 00:07:52.457
has been the discovery
of other planets going around other stars.

00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:54.387
These are called exoplanets.

00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:59.407
And until 1995, we didn't even know
the existence of any other planets,

00:07:59.431 --> 00:08:01.765
other than going around our own sun.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.781
But now, there are almost 2,000
other planets orbiting other stars

00:08:08.805 --> 00:08:11.365
that we can now detect,
measure masses for.

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:15.061
There are 500 of those
that are multiple-planet systems.

00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:19.045
And there are 4,000 --
and still counting -- other candidates

00:08:19.069 --> 00:08:21.283
for planets orbiting other stars.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.763
They come in a bewildering variety
of different kinds.

00:08:25.134 --> 00:08:28.420
There are Jupiter-like
planets that are hot,

00:08:28.444 --> 00:08:32.702
there are other planets that are icy,
there are water worlds

00:08:32.726 --> 00:08:35.980
and there are rocky planets
like the Earth, so-called "super-Earths,"

00:08:36.004 --> 00:08:40.691
and there have even been planets
that have been speculated diamond worlds.

00:08:41.794 --> 00:08:46.749
So we know there's at least one planet,
our own Earth, in which there is life.

00:08:46.773 --> 00:08:50.933
We've even found planets
that are orbiting two stars.

00:08:50.957 --> 00:08:54.138
That's no longer the province
of science fiction.

00:08:55.211 --> 00:08:57.425
So around our own planet,
we know there's life,

00:08:57.449 --> 00:09:03.165
we've developed a complex life,
we now can question our own origins.

00:09:03.728 --> 00:09:07.948
And given all that we've discovered,
the overwhelming numbers now suggest

00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:12.044
that there may be millions, perhaps --
maybe even hundreds of millions --

00:09:12.068 --> 00:09:14.847
of other [planets]
that are close enough --

00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:18.161
just the right distance from their stars
that they're orbiting --

00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:23.721
to have the existence of liquid water
and maybe could potentially support life.

00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:28.295
So we marvel now at those odds,
the overwhelming odds,

00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:31.262
and the amazing thing
is that within the next decade,

00:09:31.286 --> 00:09:36.516
the GMT may be able to take spectra
of the atmospheres of those planets,

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.052
and determine whether or not
they have the potential for life.

00:09:41.702 --> 00:09:43.482
So, what is the GMT project?

00:09:43.506 --> 00:09:45.380
It's an international project.

00:09:45.404 --> 00:09:51.253
It includes Australia, South Korea,
and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio,

00:09:51.277 --> 00:09:54.312
that the newest partner
in our telescope is Brazil.

00:09:54.825 --> 00:09:59.284
(Applause)

00:09:59.308 --> 00:10:04.098
It also includes a number of institutions
across the United States,

00:10:04.122 --> 00:10:07.218
including Harvard University,

00:10:07.242 --> 00:10:10.186
the Smithsonian
and the Carnegie Institutions,

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:16.677
and the Universities of Arizona, Chicago,
Texas-Austin and Texas A&amp;M University.

00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:18.961
It also involves Chile.

00:10:20.723 --> 00:10:23.935
So, the making of the mirrors
in this telescope is also fascinating

00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:25.324
in its own right.

00:10:25.348 --> 00:10:29.983
Take chunks of glass, melt them
in a furnace that is itself rotating.

00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:32.842
This happens underneath
the football stadium

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:34.908
at the University of Arizona.

00:10:34.932 --> 00:10:37.868
It's tucked away under 52,000 seats.

00:10:37.892 --> 00:10:39.293
Nobody know it's happening.

00:10:39.738 --> 00:10:43.062
And there's essentially
a rotating cauldron.

00:10:43.086 --> 00:10:46.121
The mirrors are cast
and they're cooled very slowly,

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:49.058
and then they're polished
to an exquisite precision.

00:10:49.637 --> 00:10:52.714
And so, if you think
about the precision of these mirrors,

00:10:52.738 --> 00:10:57.291
the bumps on the mirror,
over the entire 27 feet,

00:10:57.315 --> 00:11:00.994
amount to less
than one-millionth of an inch.

00:11:01.018 --> 00:11:02.542
So, can you visualize that?

00:11:03.089 --> 00:11:04.240
Ow!

00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:05.588
(Laughter)

00:11:05.612 --> 00:11:11.883
That's one five-thousandths
of the width of one of my hairs,

00:11:11.907 --> 00:11:14.044
over this entire 27 feet.

00:11:14.068 --> 00:11:15.938
It's a spectacular achievement.

00:11:15.962 --> 00:11:19.277
It's what allows us to have
the precision that we will have.

00:11:20.876 --> 00:11:23.293
So, what does that precision buy us?

00:11:23.843 --> 00:11:26.582
So the GMT, if you can imagine --

00:11:26.606 --> 00:11:31.055
if I were to hold up a coin,
which I just happen to have,

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:36.070
and I look at the face of that coin,
I can see from here

00:11:36.094 --> 00:11:40.079
the writing on the coin;
I can see the face on that coin.

00:11:40.103 --> 00:11:43.217
My guess that even in the front row,
you can't see that.

00:11:43.645 --> 00:11:46.507
But if we were to turn
the Giant Magellan Telescope,

00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:49.904
all 80-feet diameter
that we see in this auditorium,

00:11:49.928 --> 00:11:52.997
and point it 200 miles away,

00:11:53.021 --> 00:11:58.889
if I were standing in São Paulo,
we could resolve the face of this coin.

00:11:58.913 --> 00:12:02.520
That's the extraordinary resolution
and power of this telescope.

00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:06.459
And if we were --

00:12:06.483 --> 00:12:10.353
(Applause)

00:12:10.377 --> 00:12:14.978
If an astronaut went up to the Moon,
a quarter of a million miles away,

00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:17.918
and lit a candle -- a single candle --

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:20.752
then we would be able
to detect it, using the GMT.

00:12:21.347 --> 00:12:22.629
Quite extraordinary.

00:12:25.334 --> 00:12:31.015
This is a simulated image
of a cluster in a nearby galaxy.

00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:33.624
"Nearby" is astronomical,
it's all relative.

00:12:33.648 --> 00:12:36.151
It's tens of millions of light-years away.

00:12:36.175 --> 00:12:38.189
This is what this cluster would look like.

00:12:38.213 --> 00:12:40.381
So look at those four bright objects,

00:12:40.405 --> 00:12:44.412
and now lets compare it with a camera
on the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:12:44.436 --> 00:12:47.615
You can see faint detail
that starts to come through.

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:53.934
And now finally -- and look how dramatic
this is -- this is what the GMT will see.

00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.328
So, keep your eyes on those
bright images again.

00:12:56.352 --> 00:13:00.770
This is what we see on one of the most
powerful existing telescopes on the Earth,

00:13:00.794 --> 00:13:03.675
and this, again, what the GMT will see.

00:13:04.554 --> 00:13:06.412
Extraordinary precision.

00:13:06.975 --> 00:13:08.297
So, where are we?

00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:11.503
We have now leveled the top
of the mountaintop in Chile.

00:13:11.527 --> 00:13:13.290
We blasted that off.

00:13:13.314 --> 00:13:16.033
We've tested and polished
the first mirror.

00:13:16.057 --> 00:13:18.646
We've cast the second
and the third mirrors.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.939
And we're about to cast the fourth mirror.

00:13:20.963 --> 00:13:22.850
We had a series of reviews this year,

00:13:22.874 --> 00:13:25.416
international panels
that came in and reviewed us,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.971
and said, "You're ready
to go to construction."

00:13:27.995 --> 00:13:31.344
And so we plan on building this telescope
with the first four mirrors.

00:13:31.368 --> 00:13:35.497
We want to get on the air quickly,
and be taking science data --

00:13:35.521 --> 00:13:40.100
what we astronomers call
"first light," in 2021.

00:13:41.031 --> 00:13:44.477
And the full telescope will be finished
in the middle of the next decade,

00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:45.897
with all seven mirrors.

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:50.100
So we're now poised to look back
at the distant universe,

00:13:50.124 --> 00:13:51.432
the cosmic dawn.

00:13:51.804 --> 00:13:55.937
We'll be able to study other planets
in exquisite detail.

00:13:56.424 --> 00:14:00.161
But for me, one of the most
exciting things about building the GMT

00:14:00.185 --> 00:14:03.015
is the opportunity
to actually discover something

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:06.309
that we don't know about --
that we can't even imagine at this point,

00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:07.975
something completely new.

00:14:08.713 --> 00:14:12.343
And my hope is that with the construction
of this and other facilities,

00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:17.577
that many young women and men
will be inspired to reach for the stars.

00:14:18.036 --> 00:14:19.308
Thank you very much.

00:14:19.332 --> 00:14:20.807
Obrigado.

00:14:20.831 --> 00:14:26.724
(Applause)

00:14:26.748 --> 00:14:28.350
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy.

00:14:28.374 --> 00:14:30.641
Stay with me, because
I have a question for you.

00:14:30.665 --> 00:14:33.062
You mentioned different facilities.

00:14:33.086 --> 00:14:37.939
So the Magellan Telescope is going up,
but also ALMA and others in Chile

00:14:37.963 --> 00:14:40.099
and elsewhere, including in Hawaii.

00:14:40.772 --> 00:14:44.848
Is it about cooperation
and complementarity, or about competition?

00:14:44.872 --> 00:14:48.594
I know there's competition in terms
of funding, but what about the science?

00:14:48.618 --> 00:14:51.835
Wendy Freedman: In terms of the science,
they're very complementary.

00:14:51.859 --> 00:14:54.886
The telescopes that are in space,
the telescopes on the ground,

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.340
telescopes with different
wavelength capability,

00:14:57.364 --> 00:15:00.307
telescopes even that are similar,
but different instruments --

00:15:00.331 --> 00:15:04.077
they will all look at different parts
of the questions that we're asking.

00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:07.728
So when we discover other planets,
we'll be able to test those observations,

00:15:07.752 --> 00:15:09.840
we'll be able to measure the atmospheres,

00:15:09.864 --> 00:15:12.739
be able to look in space
with very high resolution.

00:15:12.763 --> 00:15:14.240
So, they're very complementary.

00:15:14.264 --> 00:15:16.501
You're right about
the funding, we compete;

00:15:16.525 --> 00:15:19.190
but scientifically,
it's very complementary.

00:15:19.214 --> 00:15:21.867
BG: Wendy, thank you very much
for coming to TEDGlobal.

00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:23.042
WF: Thank you.

00:15:23.066 --> 00:15:24.754
(Applause)
