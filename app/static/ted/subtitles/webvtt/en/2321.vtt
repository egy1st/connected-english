00:00:00.972 --> 00:00:06.905
Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize
[winner] in economics, once wrote:

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:12.325
"Productivity is not everything,
but in the long run,

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.523
it is almost everything."

00:00:16.062 --> 00:00:17.468
So this is serious.

00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:23.018
There are not that many things on earth
that are "almost everything."

00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:30.911
Productivity is the principal driver
of the prosperity of a society.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.115
So we have a problem.

00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:36.606
In the largest European economies,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.780
productivity used to grow
five percent per annum

00:00:39.804 --> 00:00:42.919
in the '50s, '60s, early '70s.

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:46.971
From '73 to '83: three percent per annum.

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:50.284
From '83 to '95: two percent per annum.

00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:55.018
Since 1995: less than
one percent per annum.

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:57.486
The same profile in Japan.

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:00.985
The same profile in the US,

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:06.342
despite a momentary rebound 15 years ago,

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.730
and despite all
the technological innovations

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:12.333
around us: the Internet, the information,

00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:15.578
the new information
and communication technologies.

00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:20.734
When productivity grows
three percent per annum,

00:01:20.758 --> 00:01:24.400
you double the standard of living
every generation.

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:30.178
Every generation is twice
as well-off as its parents'.

00:01:30.686 --> 00:01:34.012
When it grows one percent per annum,

00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:37.663
it takes three generations
to double the standard of living.

00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:43.481
And in this process, many people
will be less well-off than their parents.

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:46.019
They will have less of everything:

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:49.534
smaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all,

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:57.044
less access to education, to vitamins,
to antibiotics, to vaccination --

00:01:57.068 --> 00:01:58.343
to everything.

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:05.363
Think of all the problems
that we're facing at the moment.

00:02:06.347 --> 00:02:07.509
All.

00:02:08.692 --> 00:02:13.131
Chances are that they are rooted
in the productivity crisis.

00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:16.907
Why this crisis?

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:23.913
Because the basic tenets
about efficiency --

00:02:23.937 --> 00:02:28.748
effectiveness in organizations,
in management --

00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:33.023
have become counterproductive
for human efforts.

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:37.705
Everywhere in public services --
in companies, in the way we work,

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:42.065
the way we innovate, invest --
try to learn to work better.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:47.440
Take the holy trinity of efficiency:

00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:54.717
clarity, measurement, accountability.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.467
They make human efforts derail.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.722
There are two ways
to look at it, to prove it.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:06.412
One, the one I prefer,

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:11.981
is rigorous, elegant, nice -- math.

00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:15.856
But the full math version
takes a little while,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.675
so there is another one.

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.165
It is to look at a relay race.

00:03:20.697 --> 00:03:22.365
This is what we will do today.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:28.739
It's a bit more animated, more visual
and also faster -- it's a race.

00:03:29.572 --> 00:03:30.866
Hopefully, it's faster.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.254
(Laughter)

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:37.236
World championship final -- women.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.371
Eight teams in the final.

00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:42.200
The fastest team is the US team.

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.796
They have the fastest women on earth.

00:03:46.153 --> 00:03:48.928
They are the favorite team to win.

00:03:48.952 --> 00:03:53.142
Notably, if you compare them
to an average team,

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.540
say, the French team,

00:03:54.564 --> 00:03:56.151
(Laughter)

00:03:56.175 --> 00:04:01.370
based on their best performances
in the 100-meter race,

00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:07.163
if you add the individual times
of the US runners,

00:04:07.187 --> 00:04:14.099
they arrive at the finish line
3.2 meters ahead of the French team.

00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:17.462
And this year, the US team
is in great shape.

00:04:18.034 --> 00:04:20.420
Based on their best performance this year,

00:04:20.444 --> 00:04:25.349
they arrive 6.4 meters
ahead of the French team,

00:04:25.373 --> 00:04:26.738
based on the data.

00:04:27.274 --> 00:04:28.853
We are going to look at the race.

00:04:28.877 --> 00:04:31.300
At some point you will see,
towards the end,

00:04:31.324 --> 00:04:37.630
that Torri Edwards,
the fourth US runner, is ahead.

00:04:37.654 --> 00:04:44.143
Not surprising -- this year she got
the gold medal in the 100-meter race.

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:49.109
And by the way, Chryste Gaines,
the second runner in the US team,

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:51.770
is the fastest woman on earth.

00:04:51.794 --> 00:04:56.947
So, there are 3.5 billion women on earth.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.063
Where are the two fastest? On the US team.

00:05:01.087 --> 00:05:04.360
And the two other runners
on the US team are not bad, either.

00:05:04.384 --> 00:05:06.100
(Laughter)

00:05:06.124 --> 00:05:10.795
So clearly, the US team has won
the war for talent.

00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:16.372
But behind, the average team
is trying to catch up.

00:05:16.396 --> 00:05:17.745
Let's watch the race.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.325
(Video: French sportscasters narrate race)

00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:08.886
(Video: Race narration ends)

00:06:10.112 --> 00:06:11.607
Yves Morieux: So what happened?

00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:16.042
The fastest team did not win;
the slower one did.

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.746
By the way, I hope you appreciate

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.696
the deep historical research I did
to make the French look good.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.015
(Laughter)

00:06:29.485 --> 00:06:33.904
But let's not exaggerate --
it's not archeology, either.

00:06:33.928 --> 00:06:35.909
(Laughter)

00:06:35.933 --> 00:06:37.099
But why?

00:06:37.123 --> 00:06:38.663
Because of cooperation.

00:06:38.687 --> 00:06:40.521
When you hear this sentence:

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:44.946
"Thanks to cooperation, the whole
is worth more than the sum of the parts."

00:06:45.707 --> 00:06:49.022
This is not poetry;
this is not philosophy.

00:06:49.046 --> 00:06:50.561
This is math.

00:06:51.196 --> 00:06:54.476
Those who carry the baton are slower,

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.197
but their baton is faster.

00:06:56.848 --> 00:06:58.483
Miracle of cooperation:

00:06:59.057 --> 00:07:04.337
it multiplies energy,
intelligence in human efforts.

00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:07.336
It is the essence of human efforts:

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.176
how we work together, how each effort
contributes to the efforts of others.

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:17.265
With cooperation,
we can do more with less.

00:07:17.788 --> 00:07:23.336
Now, what happens to cooperation
when the holy grail --

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.798
the holy trinity, even --

00:07:25.822 --> 00:07:32.043
of clarity, measurement, accountability --

00:07:32.067 --> 00:07:33.236
appears?

00:07:34.952 --> 00:07:36.104
Clarity.

00:07:36.128 --> 00:07:40.709
Management reports are full of complaints
about the lack of clarity.

00:07:41.424 --> 00:07:45.141
Compliance audits,
consultants' diagnostics.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.022
We need more clarity, we need
to clarify the roles, the processes.

00:07:52.092 --> 00:07:56.108
It is as though the runners
on the team were saying,

00:07:56.132 --> 00:08:02.080
"Let's be clear -- where does my role
really start and end?

00:08:02.938 --> 00:08:07.770
Am I supposed to run for 95 meters,
96, 97...?"

00:08:07.794 --> 00:08:09.584
It's important, let's be clear.

00:08:10.885 --> 00:08:13.891
If you say 97, after 97 meters,

00:08:13.915 --> 00:08:17.447
people will drop the baton, whether
there is someone to take it or not.

00:08:19.145 --> 00:08:20.367
Accountability.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:24.534
We are constantly trying
to put accountability

00:08:24.558 --> 00:08:26.131
in someone's hands.

00:08:26.559 --> 00:08:29.132
Who is accountable for this process?

00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:32.277
We need somebody accountable
for this process.

00:08:32.634 --> 00:08:37.095
So in the relay race,
since passing the baton is so important,

00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:40.866
then we need somebody
clearly accountable for passing the baton.

00:08:41.786 --> 00:08:43.965
So between each runner,

00:08:43.989 --> 00:08:48.713
now we will have a new dedicated athlete,

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:53.282
clearly dedicated to taking
the baton from one runner,

00:08:53.306 --> 00:08:55.602
and passing it to the next runner.

00:08:56.284 --> 00:08:58.793
And we will have at least two like that.

00:09:00.381 --> 00:09:06.841
Well, will we, in that case, win the race?

00:09:07.903 --> 00:09:09.904
That I don't know, but for sure,

00:09:09.928 --> 00:09:13.198
we would have a clear interface,

00:09:13.222 --> 00:09:15.866
a clear line of accountability.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.818
We will know who to blame.

00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:21.075
But we'll never win the race.

00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:26.086
If you think about it,
we pay more attention

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.265
to knowing who to blame in case we fail,

00:09:30.289 --> 00:09:34.010
than to creating
the conditions to succeed.

00:09:35.384 --> 00:09:38.747
All the human intelligence
put in organization design --

00:09:38.771 --> 00:09:41.556
urban structures, processing systems --

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.204
what is the real goal?

00:09:44.347 --> 00:09:47.277
To have somebody guilty in case they fail.

00:09:48.499 --> 00:09:53.386
We are creating
organizations able to fail,

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.387
but in a compliant way,

00:09:56.411 --> 00:09:59.853
with somebody clearly
accountable when we fail.

00:09:59.877 --> 00:10:03.701
And we are quite effective
at that -- failing.

00:10:04.892 --> 00:10:06.053
Measurement.

00:10:06.674 --> 00:10:08.102
What gets measured gets done.

00:10:08.126 --> 00:10:12.517
Look, to pass the baton,
you have to do it at the right time,

00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:15.016
in the right hand, at the right speed.

00:10:15.457 --> 00:10:18.016
But to do that, you have to put
energy in your arm.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.031
This energy that is in your arm
will not be in your legs.

00:10:21.491 --> 00:10:24.470
It will come at the expense
of your measurable speed.

00:10:25.367 --> 00:10:28.820
You have to shout early enough
to the next runner

00:10:28.844 --> 00:10:32.155
when you will pass the baton,
to signal that you are arriving,

00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:35.384
so that the next runner
can prepare, can anticipate.

00:10:35.408 --> 00:10:37.571
And you have to shout loud.

00:10:38.182 --> 00:10:42.155
But the blood, the energy
that will be in your throat

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:43.579
will not be in your legs.

00:10:43.603 --> 00:10:47.359
Because you know, there are
eight people shouting at the same time.

00:10:47.383 --> 00:10:50.022
So you have to recognize the voice
of your colleague.

00:10:50.372 --> 00:10:52.125
You cannot say, "Is it you?"

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.724
Too late!

00:10:53.748 --> 00:10:54.954
(Laughter)

00:10:54.978 --> 00:10:59.954
Now, let's look at the race
in slow motion,

00:10:59.978 --> 00:11:02.526
and concentrate on the third runner.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.973
Look at where she allocates her efforts,

00:11:06.997 --> 00:11:09.704
her energy, her attention.

00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:14.022
Not all in her legs -- that would
be great for her own speed --

00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:17.536
but in also in her throat,
arm, eye, brain.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.906
That makes a difference in whose legs?

00:11:20.314 --> 00:11:22.426
In the legs of the next runner.

00:11:22.728 --> 00:11:25.562
But when the next runner runs super-fast,

00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:27.714
is it because she made a super effort,

00:11:27.738 --> 00:11:30.975
or because of the way
the third runner passed the baton?

00:11:31.403 --> 00:11:35.258
There is no metric on earth
that will give us the answer.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.821
And if we reward people on the basis
of their measurable performance,

00:11:40.845 --> 00:11:43.899
they will put their energy,
their attention, their blood

00:11:43.923 --> 00:11:45.946
in what can get measured -- in their legs.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.827
And the baton will fall and slow down.

00:11:49.534 --> 00:11:52.106
To cooperate is not a super effort,

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.153
it is how you allocate your effort.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.120
It is to take a risk,

00:11:57.144 --> 00:12:01.374
because you sacrifice
the ultimate protection

00:12:01.398 --> 00:12:06.825
granted by objectively measurable
individual performance.

00:12:08.516 --> 00:12:12.393
It is to make a super difference
in the performance of others,

00:12:12.417 --> 00:12:14.107
with whom we are compared.

00:12:14.757 --> 00:12:17.091
It takes being stupid to cooperate, then.

00:12:17.551 --> 00:12:20.281
And people are not stupid;
they don't cooperate.

00:12:20.738 --> 00:12:25.878
You know, clarity, accountability,
measurement were OK

00:12:25.902 --> 00:12:28.318
when the world was simpler.

00:12:28.929 --> 00:12:31.953
But business has become much more complex.

00:12:31.977 --> 00:12:34.008
With my teams, we have measured

00:12:34.032 --> 00:12:37.056
the evolution of complexity in business.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.683
It is much more demanding today
to attract and retain customers,

00:12:42.707 --> 00:12:46.018
to build advantage on a global scale,

00:12:46.042 --> 00:12:47.501
to create value.

00:12:48.691 --> 00:12:51.448
And the more business gets complex,

00:12:51.472 --> 00:12:56.773
the more, in the name of clarity,
accountability, measurement

00:12:56.797 --> 00:13:00.461
we multiply structures,
processes, systems.

00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:05.892
You know, this drive for clarity
and accountability triggers

00:13:05.916 --> 00:13:11.271
a counterproductive multiplication
of interfaces, middle offices,

00:13:11.295 --> 00:13:16.332
coordinators that do not only
mobilize people and resources,

00:13:16.356 --> 00:13:18.665
but that also add obstacles.

00:13:19.276 --> 00:13:23.846
And the more complicated the organization,

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:27.523
the more difficult it is to understand
what is really happening.

00:13:27.547 --> 00:13:32.967
So we need summaries, proxies, reports,

00:13:32.991 --> 00:13:36.291
key performance indicators, metrics.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:41.027
So people put their energy
in what can get measured,

00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:43.146
at the expense of cooperation.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.702
And as performance deteriorates,

00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:48.855
we add even more structure,
process, systems.

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:51.711
People spend their time in meetings,

00:13:51.735 --> 00:13:55.861
writing reports they have
to do, undo and redo.

00:13:56.289 --> 00:13:59.711
Based on our analysis,
teams in these organizations

00:13:59.735 --> 00:14:05.906
spend between 40 and 80 percent
of their time wasting their time,

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.923
but working harder and harder,
longer and longer,

00:14:09.947 --> 00:14:12.890
on less and less value-adding activities.

00:14:14.242 --> 00:14:16.552
This is what is killing productivity,

00:14:16.576 --> 00:14:18.774
what makes people suffer at work.

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:23.763
Our organizations are wasting
human intelligence.

00:14:23.787 --> 00:14:27.435
They have turned against human efforts.

00:14:28.673 --> 00:14:31.563
When people don't cooperate,

00:14:31.587 --> 00:14:35.982
don't blame their mindsets,
their mentalities, their personality --

00:14:36.006 --> 00:14:38.157
look at the work situations.

00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:43.374
Is it really in their personal interest
to cooperate or not,

00:14:43.398 --> 00:14:47.383
if, when they cooperate,
they are individually worse off?

00:14:47.914 --> 00:14:49.533
Why would they cooperate?

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:53.514
When we blame personalities

00:14:53.538 --> 00:14:59.696
instead of the clarity,
the accountability, the measurement,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.378
we add injustice to ineffectiveness.

00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:07.567
We need to create organizations

00:15:07.591 --> 00:15:11.905
in which it becomes individually useful
for people to cooperate.

00:15:12.807 --> 00:15:17.602
Remove the interfaces,
the middle offices --

00:15:17.626 --> 00:15:20.684
all these complicated
coordination structures.

00:15:21.573 --> 00:15:25.953
Don't look for clarity; go for fuzziness.

00:15:25.977 --> 00:15:27.992
Fuzziness overlaps.

00:15:29.244 --> 00:15:33.724
Remove most of the quantitative metrics
to assess performance.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.732
Speed the "what."

00:15:36.414 --> 00:15:39.231
Look at cooperation, the "how."

00:15:39.255 --> 00:15:40.856
How did you pass the baton?

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.442
Did you throw it,
or did you pass it effectively?

00:15:46.569 --> 00:15:52.627
Am I putting my energy
in what can get measured --

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:56.786
my legs, my speed --
or in passing the baton?

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:01.153
You, as leaders, as managers,

00:16:01.177 --> 00:16:06.729
are you making it individually useful
for people to cooperate?

00:16:08.205 --> 00:16:11.343
The future of our organizations,

00:16:11.367 --> 00:16:15.160
our companies, our societies

00:16:15.184 --> 00:16:20.277
hinges on your answer to these questions.

00:16:21.035 --> 00:16:22.216
Thank you.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.725
(Applause)
