00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:06.518
If you want to buy high-quality,
low-price cocaine,

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:09.379
there really is only one place to go,

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:12.882
and that is the dark net
anonymous markets.

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:15.288
Now, you can't get to these sites

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:19.775
with a normal browser --
Chrome or Firefox --

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:22.932
because they're on this
hidden part of the Internet,

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.058
known as Tor hidden services,

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:29.775
where URLs are a string of meaningless
numbers and letters that end in .onion,

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:32.605
and which you access
with a special browser

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.074
called the Tor browser.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:39.375
Now, the Tor browser was originally
a U.S. Naval intelligence project.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.280
It then became open source,

00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:43.891
and it allows anybody to browse the net

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:46.367
without giving away their location.

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:50.495
And it does this
by encrypting your IP address

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.295
and then routing it via several
other computers around the world

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.658
that use the same software.

00:00:57.508 --> 00:00:59.775
You can use it on the normal Internet,

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.514
but it's also your key to the dark net.

00:01:04.438 --> 00:01:07.508
And because of this fiendishly
clever encryption system,

00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:12.951
the 20 or 30 -- we don't know exactly --
thousand sites that operate there

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:16.182
are incredibly difficult to shut down.

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:22.095
It is a censorship-free world
visited by anonymous users.

00:01:23.268 --> 00:01:27.586
Little wonder, then,
that it's a natural place to go

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.522
for anybody with something to hide,

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:34.137
and that something, of course,
need not be illegal.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.638
On the dark net, you will find

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.900
whistle-blower sites, The New Yorker.

00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:41.711
You will find political activism blogs.

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:44.843
You will find libraries of pirated books.

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:48.490
But you'll also find the drugs markets,

00:01:48.514 --> 00:01:52.619
illegal pornography,
commercial hacking services,

00:01:52.643 --> 00:01:54.240
and much more besides.

00:01:54.264 --> 00:02:00.074
Now, the dark net is one of the most
interesting, exciting places

00:02:00.098 --> 00:02:01.775
anywhere on the net.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.475
And the reason is, because
although innovation, of course,

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.775
takes place in big businesses,

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.198
takes place in world-class universities,

00:02:10.222 --> 00:02:12.775
it also takes place in the fringes,

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.342
because those on the fringes --
the pariahs, the outcasts --

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.603
they're often the most creative,
because they have to be.

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.052
In this part of the Internet,

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:26.355
you will not find a single lolcat,

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.560
a single pop-up advert anywhere.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.862
And that's one of the reasons why I think

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:35.575
many of you here will be
on the dark net fairly soon.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.599
(Laughter)

00:02:38.177 --> 00:02:41.469
Not that I'm suggesting
anyone in this audience would use it

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:43.770
to go and procure high-quality narcotics.

00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:46.390
But let's say for a moment that you were.

00:02:46.414 --> 00:02:47.987
(Laughter)

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.591
Bear with me.

00:02:50.868 --> 00:02:55.444
The first thing you will notice
on signing up to one of these sites

00:02:55.468 --> 00:02:57.053
is how familiar it looks.

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.265
Every single product --

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:03.153
thousands of products --

00:03:03.177 --> 00:03:07.193
has a glossy, high-res image,

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:10.065
a detailed product description, a price.

00:03:10.414 --> 00:03:13.494
There's a "Proceed to checkout" icon.

00:03:13.518 --> 00:03:16.276
There is even, most beautifully of all,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.458
a "Report this item" button.

00:03:18.482 --> 00:03:21.189
(Laughter)

00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:23.139
Incredible.

00:03:23.163 --> 00:03:25.550
You browse through the site,
you make your choice,

00:03:25.574 --> 00:03:27.993
you pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin,

00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:31.046
you enter an address -- 
preferably not your home address --

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.775
and you wait for your product
to arrive in the post,

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.662
which it nearly always does.

00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:41.139
And the reason it does
is not because of the clever encryption.

00:03:41.163 --> 00:03:42.328
That's important.

00:03:42.674 --> 00:03:46.003
Something far simpler than that.

00:03:46.027 --> 00:03:47.252
It's the user reviews.

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:49.259
(Laughter)

00:03:49.283 --> 00:03:53.054
You see, every single vendor
on these sites

00:03:53.078 --> 00:03:55.396
uses a pseudonym, naturally enough,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.213
but they keep the same pseudonym
to build up a reputation.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.910
And because it's easy for the buyer
to change allegiance whenever they want,

00:04:04.934 --> 00:04:09.207
the only way of trusting a vendor

00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:12.869
is if they have a good history
of positive feedback

00:04:12.893 --> 00:04:14.483
from other users of the site.

00:04:15.396 --> 00:04:19.873
And this introduction
of competition and choice

00:04:19.897 --> 00:04:24.166
does exactly what
the economists would predict.

00:04:25.346 --> 00:04:30.032
Prices tend to go down,
product quality tends to go up,

00:04:30.056 --> 00:04:32.429
and the vendors are attentive,

00:04:32.453 --> 00:04:34.884
they're polite, they're consumer-centric,

00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:39.220
offering you all manner
of special deals, one-offs,

00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:42.415
buy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery,

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.623
to keep you happy.

00:04:44.953 --> 00:04:47.871
I spoke to Drugsheaven.

00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:53.785
Drugsheaven was offering
excellent and consistent marijuana

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:55.351
at a reasonable price.

00:04:56.154 --> 00:04:59.963
He had a very generous refund policy,

00:04:59.987 --> 00:05:01.775
detailed T's and C's,

00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:03.211
and good shipping times.

00:05:03.608 --> 00:05:05.869
"Dear Drugsheaven," I wrote,

00:05:05.893 --> 00:05:09.707
via the internal emailing system
that's also encrypted, of course.

00:05:10.397 --> 00:05:14.538
"I'm new here. Do you mind
if I buy just one gram of marijuana?"

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.574
A couple of hours later, I get a reply.

00:05:17.598 --> 00:05:18.784
They always reply.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.026
"Hi there, thanks for your email.

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:27.422
Starting small is a wise thing to do.
I would, too, if I were you."

00:05:27.446 --> 00:05:29.208
(Laughter)

00:05:29.232 --> 00:05:32.353
"So no problem if you'd like to start
with just one gram.

00:05:32.377 --> 00:05:34.888
I do hope we can do business together.

00:05:34.912 --> 00:05:36.775
Best wishes, Drugsheaven."

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:38.775
(Laughter)

00:05:38.799 --> 00:05:42.063
I don't know why he had a posh
English accent, but I assume he did.

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:48.775
Now, this kind
of consumer-centric attitude

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:54.235
is the reason why, when I reviewed
120,000 pieces of feedback

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.239
that had been left on one of these sites
over a three-month period,

00:05:58.263 --> 00:06:01.392
95 percent of them were five out of five.

00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:05.104
The customer, you see, is king.

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:07.009
But what does that mean?

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.974
Well, on the one hand,

00:06:08.998 --> 00:06:13.032
that means there are more drugs,
more available, more easily,

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:14.207
to more people.

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:17.729
And by my reckoning,
that is not a good thing.

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:22.512
But, on the other hand,
if you are going to take drugs,

00:06:22.536 --> 00:06:25.597
you have a reasonably good way

00:06:25.621 --> 00:06:30.035
of guaranteeing a certain level
of purity and quality,

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:33.775
which is incredibly important
if you're taking drugs.

00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:36.917
And you can do so
from the comfort of your own home,

00:06:36.941 --> 00:06:41.128
without the risks associated
with buying on the streets.

00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:43.437
Now, as I said,

00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:47.563
you've got to be creative and innovative
to survive in this marketplace.

00:06:48.277 --> 00:06:51.371
And the 20 or so sites
that are currently in operation --

00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:55.100
by the way, they don't always work,
they're not always perfect;

00:06:55.124 --> 00:06:57.726
the site that I showed you
was shut down 18 months ago,

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.901
but not before it had turned
over a billion dollars' worth of trade.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.623
But these markets,

00:07:06.647 --> 00:07:09.709
because of the difficult conditions
in which they are operating,

00:07:09.733 --> 00:07:11.221
the inhospitable conditions,

00:07:11.245 --> 00:07:14.593
are always innovating, always
thinking of ways of getting smarter,

00:07:14.617 --> 00:07:16.855
more decentralized, harder to censor,

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.235
and more customer-friendly.

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:21.775
Let's take the payment system.

00:07:22.383 --> 00:07:24.181
You don't pay with your credit card,

00:07:24.205 --> 00:07:26.550
of course -- that would lead
directly back to you.

00:07:26.574 --> 00:07:28.551
So you use the crypto-currency bitcoin,

00:07:28.575 --> 00:07:33.030
which is easily exchanged
for real-world currencies

00:07:33.054 --> 00:07:36.799
and gives quite a high degree
of anonymity to its users.

00:07:37.367 --> 00:07:40.294
But at the beginning of these sites,
people noticed a flaw.

00:07:40.318 --> 00:07:44.383
Some of the unscrupulous dealers
were running away with peoples' bitcoin

00:07:44.407 --> 00:07:46.212
before they'd mailed the drugs out.

00:07:47.155 --> 00:07:53.050
The community came up with a solution,
called multi-signature escrow payments.

00:07:55.135 --> 00:07:58.628
So on purchasing my item,

00:07:58.652 --> 00:08:01.678
I would send my bitcoin

00:08:01.702 --> 00:08:05.994
to a neutral, secure third digital wallet.

00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:09.388
The vendor, who would see
that I'd sent it,

00:08:09.412 --> 00:08:12.368
would be confident that they
could then send the product to me,

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.775
and then when I received it,

00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:16.775
at least two of the three people
engaged in the transaction --

00:08:16.799 --> 00:08:19.339
vendor, buyer, site administrator --

00:08:19.363 --> 00:08:21.775
would have to sign the transaction off

00:08:21.799 --> 00:08:23.877
with a unique digital signature,

00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:25.876
and then the money would be transferred.

00:08:26.263 --> 00:08:27.563
Brilliant!

00:08:27.587 --> 00:08:28.738
Elegant.

00:08:28.762 --> 00:08:29.913
It works.

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:33.528
But then they realized there was
a problem with bitcoin,

00:08:33.552 --> 00:08:35.253
because every bitcoin transaction

00:08:35.277 --> 00:08:37.775
is actually recorded publicly
in a public ledger.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:41.076
So if you're clever, you can try
and work out who's behind them.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.385
So they came up with a tumbling service.

00:08:44.409 --> 00:08:47.800
Hundreds of people send
their bitcoin into one address,

00:08:47.824 --> 00:08:49.799
they're tumbled and jumbled up,

00:08:49.823 --> 00:08:53.613
and then the right amount
is sent on to the right recipients,

00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:55.459
but they're different bitcoins:

00:08:55.483 --> 00:08:57.173
micro-laundering systems.

00:08:57.197 --> 00:08:58.731
(Laughter)

00:08:58.755 --> 00:08:59.911
It's incredible.

00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:05.128
Interested in what drugs are trending
right now on the dark net markets?

00:09:05.152 --> 00:09:07.229
Check Grams, the search engine.

00:09:07.253 --> 00:09:09.418
You can even buy some advertising space.

00:09:09.442 --> 00:09:11.507
(Laughter)

00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:16.469
Are you an ethical consumer worried
about what the drugs industry is doing?

00:09:17.064 --> 00:09:18.215
Yeah.

00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:21.986
One vendor will offer you
fair trade organic cocaine.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.152
(Laughter)

00:09:23.176 --> 00:09:26.471
That's not being sourced
from Colombian druglords,

00:09:26.495 --> 00:09:27.924
but Guatemalan farmers.

00:09:27.948 --> 00:09:31.260
They even promised to reinvest
20 percent of any profits

00:09:31.284 --> 00:09:33.074
into local education programs.

00:09:33.098 --> 00:09:34.120
(Laughter)

00:09:34.144 --> 00:09:36.123
There's even a mystery shopper.

00:09:36.936 --> 00:09:40.320
Now, whatever you think
about the morality of these sites --

00:09:40.344 --> 00:09:43.659
and I submit that it's not
actually an easy question --

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:49.185
the creation of functioning,
competitive, anonymous markets,

00:09:49.209 --> 00:09:51.775
where nobody knows who anybody else is,

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:54.898
constantly at risk of being shut down
by the authorities,

00:09:54.922 --> 00:09:57.456
is a staggering achievement,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.518
a phenomenal achievement.

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:03.993
And it's that kind of innovation

00:10:04.017 --> 00:10:06.775
that's why those on the fringes

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:09.646
are often the harbingers
of what is to come.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.464
It's easy to forget

00:10:12.488 --> 00:10:14.550
that because of its short life,

00:10:14.574 --> 00:10:18.221
the Internet has actually
changed many times

00:10:18.245 --> 00:10:19.775
over the last 30 years or so.

00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:22.775
It started in the '70s
as a military project,

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:26.775
morphed in the 1980s
to an academic network,

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:29.261
co-opted by commercial
companies in the '90s,

00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:32.740
and then invaded by all of us
via social media in the noughties,

00:10:32.764 --> 00:10:34.693
but I think it's going to change again.

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:37.775
And I think things
like the dark net markets --

00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:41.775
creative, secure, difficult to censor --

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:43.401
I think that's the future.

00:10:44.929 --> 00:10:46.557
And the reason it's the future

00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:49.249
is because we're all worried
about our privacy.

00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:52.498
Surveys consistently show
concerns about privacy.

00:10:52.522 --> 00:10:56.481
The more time we spend online,
the more we worry about them,

00:10:56.505 --> 00:10:58.775
and those surveys show
our worries are growing.

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:00.915
We're worried about
what happens to our data.

00:11:00.939 --> 00:11:03.048
We're worried about
who might be watching us.

00:11:03.072 --> 00:11:05.640
Since the revelations from Edward Snowden,

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:08.110
there's been a huge increase
in the number of people

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:11.226
using various privacy-enhancing tools.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.487
There are now between two
and three million daily users

00:11:14.511 --> 00:11:15.786
of the Tor browser,

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:20.977
the majority of which use
is perfectly legitimate,

00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:22.760
sometimes even mundane.

00:11:23.658 --> 00:11:26.809
And there are hundreds of activists
around the world

00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:32.099
working on techniques and tools
to keep you private online --

00:11:33.111 --> 00:11:35.592
default encrypted messaging services.

00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:39.639
Ethereum, which is a project
which tries to link up

00:11:39.663 --> 00:11:44.741
the connected but unused hard drives
of millions of computers around the world,

00:11:44.765 --> 00:11:48.636
to create a sort of distributed Internet
that no one really controls.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.553
Now, we've had distributed
computing before, of course.

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:55.775
We use it for everything from Skype
to the search for extraterrestrial life.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:12:00.288
But you add distributed computing
and powerful encryption --

00:12:00.312 --> 00:12:04.199
that's very, very hard
to censor and control.

00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:07.438
Another called MaidSafe
works on similar principles.

00:12:07.462 --> 00:12:10.910
Another called Twister,
and so on and so on.

00:12:11.396 --> 00:12:13.386
And here's the thing --

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.874
the more of us join,

00:12:14.898 --> 00:12:17.349
the more interesting those sites become,

00:12:17.373 --> 00:12:19.861
and then the more of us join, and so on.

00:12:20.268 --> 00:12:22.293
And I think that's what's going to happen.

00:12:22.317 --> 00:12:24.465
In fact, it's already happening.

00:12:24.489 --> 00:12:28.365
The dark net is no longer
a den for dealers

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:30.956
and a hideout for whistle-blowers.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.667
It's already going mainstream.

00:12:33.698 --> 00:12:40.272
Just recently, the musician Aphex Twin
released his album as a dark net site.

00:12:40.296 --> 00:12:44.249
Facebook has started a dark net site.

00:12:44.273 --> 00:12:47.906
A group of London architects
have opened a dark net site

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.775
for people worried
about regeneration projects.

00:12:50.799 --> 00:12:53.372
Yes, the dark net is going mainstream,

00:12:53.396 --> 00:12:57.013
and I predict that fairly soon,
every social media company,

00:12:57.037 --> 00:12:58.472
every major news outlet,

00:12:58.496 --> 00:13:01.580
and therefore most of you
in this audience,

00:13:01.604 --> 00:13:03.960
will be using the dark net, too.

00:13:04.942 --> 00:13:07.971
So the Internet is about to get
more interesting,

00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:10.775
more exciting, more innovative,

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:12.524
more terrible,

00:13:12.548 --> 00:13:13.902
more destructive.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.413
That's good news
if you care about liberty.

00:13:17.437 --> 00:13:19.407
It's good news if you care about freedom.

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:21.550
It's good news if you care
about democracy.

00:13:21.574 --> 00:13:22.952
It's also good news

00:13:22.976 --> 00:13:25.422
if you want to browse
for illegal pornography

00:13:25.446 --> 00:13:27.775
and if you want to buy and sell drugs

00:13:27.799 --> 00:13:29.092
with impunity.

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:33.775
Neither entirely dark, nor entirely light.

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:37.476
It's not one side or the other
that's going to win out, but both.

00:13:38.352 --> 00:13:40.240
Thank you very much, indeed.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.950
(Applause)
