WEBVTT

00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:03.651
Chris Anderson: You were something
of a mathematical phenom.

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:06.739
You had already taught at Harvard
and MIT at a young age.

00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:08.953
And then the NSA came calling.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:10.668
What was that about?

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:15.130
Jim Simons: Well the NSA --
that's the National Security Agency --

00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:17.123
they didn't exactly come calling.

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:21.939
They had an operation at Princeton,
where they hired mathematicians

00:00:21.963 --> 00:00:24.905
to attack secret codes
and stuff like that.

00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:26.966
And I knew that existed.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.495
And they had a very good policy,

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.369
because you could do half your time
at your own mathematics,

00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:36.877
and at least half your time
working on their stuff.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.033
And they paid a lot.

00:00:39.057 --> 00:00:42.108
So that was an irresistible pull.

00:00:42.132 --> 00:00:44.044
So, I went there.

00:00:44.068 --> 00:00:45.406
CA: You were a code-cracker.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.596
JS: I was.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.777
CA: Until you got fired.

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.384
JS: Well, I did get fired. Yes.

00:00:49.408 --> 00:00:50.653
CA: How come?

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.613
JS: Well, how come?

00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:58.567
I got fired because,
well, the Vietnam War was on,

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:04.329
and the boss of bosses in my organization
was a big fan of the war

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:08.748
and wrote a New York Times article,
a magazine section cover story,

00:01:08.772 --> 00:01:10.542
about how we would win in Vietnam.

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:13.695
And I didn't like that war,
I thought it was stupid.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.384
And I wrote a letter to the Times,
which they published,

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:20.422
saying not everyone
who works for Maxwell Taylor,

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:25.132
if anyone remembers that name,
agrees with his views.

00:01:25.553 --> 00:01:27.211
And I gave my own views ...

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:29.399
CA: Oh, OK. I can see that would --

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.978
JS: ... which were different
from General Taylor's.

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:33.908
But in the end, nobody said anything.

00:01:33.932 --> 00:01:37.633
But then, I was 29 years old at this time,
and some kid came around

00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:40.745
and said he was a stringer
from Newsweek magazine

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:46.136
and he wanted to interview me
and ask what I was doing about my views.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.059
And I told him, "I'm doing
mostly mathematics now,

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:53.456
and when the war is over,
then I'll do mostly their stuff."

00:01:54.123 --> 00:01:56.948
Then I did the only
intelligent thing I'd done that day --

00:01:56.972 --> 00:02:01.129
I told my local boss
that I gave that interview.

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:02.612
And he said, "What'd you say?"

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:04.102
And I told him what I said.

00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:06.441
And then he said,
"I've got to call Taylor."

00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:08.842
He called Taylor; that took 10 minutes.

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:11.128
I was fired five minutes after that.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.812
CA: OK.

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:13.987
JS: But it wasn't bad.

00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:16.504
CA: It wasn't bad,
because you went on to Stony Brook

00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:19.661
and stepped up your mathematical career.

00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:22.137
You started working with this man here.

00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:23.325
Who is this?

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:25.764
JS: Oh, [Shiing-Shen] Chern.

00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:28.892
Chern was one of the great
mathematicians of the century.

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:34.149
I had known him when
I was a graduate student at Berkeley.

00:02:34.173 --> 00:02:36.044
And I had some ideas,

00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:38.515
and I brought them to him
and he liked them.

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:45.165
Together, we did this work
which you can easily see up there.

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.339
There it is.

00:02:47.198 --> 00:02:50.804
CA: It led to you publishing
a famous paper together.

00:02:50.828 --> 00:02:54.066
Can you explain at all what that work was?

00:02:55.028 --> 00:02:56.186
JS: No.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.484
(Laughter)

00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:01.030
JS: I mean, I could
explain it to somebody.

00:03:01.054 --> 00:03:03.129
(Laughter)

00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:05.017
CA: How about explaining this?

00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:07.770
JS: But not many. Not many people.

00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:11.958
CA: I think you told me
it had something to do with spheres,

00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:13.844
so let's start here.

00:03:13.868 --> 00:03:17.468
JS: Well, it did,
but I'll say about that work --

00:03:17.492 --> 00:03:20.692
it did have something to do with that,
but before we get to that --

00:03:20.716 --> 00:03:24.256
that work was good mathematics.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.772
I was very happy with it; so was Chern.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.086
It even started a little sub-field
that's now flourishing.

00:03:32.638 --> 00:03:37.932
But, more interestingly,
it happened to apply to physics,

00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:42.251
something we knew nothing about --
at least I knew nothing about physics,

00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:44.557
and I don't think Chern
knew a heck of a lot.

00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:48.544
And about 10 years
after the paper came out,

00:03:48.568 --> 00:03:53.048
a guy named Ed Witten in Princeton
started applying it to string theory

00:03:53.072 --> 00:03:57.924
and people in Russia started applying it
to what's called "condensed matter."

00:03:57.948 --> 00:04:02.841
Today, those things in there
called Chern-Simons invariants

00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:04.730
have spread through a lot of physics.

00:04:04.754 --> 00:04:05.928
And it was amazing.

00:04:05.952 --> 00:04:07.317
We didn't know any physics.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:10.568
It never occurred to me
that it would be applied to physics.

00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:14.380
But that's the thing about mathematics --
you never know where it's going to go.

00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:15.896
CA: This is so incredible.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.284
So, we've been talking about
how evolution shapes human minds

00:04:20.308 --> 00:04:22.816
that may or may not perceive the truth.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.153
Somehow, you come up
with a mathematical theory,

00:04:26.177 --> 00:04:28.025
not knowing any physics,

00:04:28.049 --> 00:04:30.547
discover two decades later
that it's being applied

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:33.602
to profoundly describe
the actual physical world.

00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:34.779
How can that happen?

00:04:34.803 --> 00:04:35.960
JS: God knows.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.094
(Laughter)

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.999
But there's a famous physicist
named [Eugene] Wigner,

00:04:42.023 --> 00:04:47.611
and he wrote an essay on the unreasonable
effectiveness of mathematics.

00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:51.587
Somehow, this mathematics,
which is rooted in the real world

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:56.606
in some sense -- we learn to count,
measure, everyone would do that --

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.460
and then it flourishes on its own.

00:04:58.976 --> 00:05:01.817
But so often it comes
back to save the day.

00:05:02.293 --> 00:05:04.471
General relativity is an example.

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:07.612
[Hermann] Minkowski had this geometry,
and Einstein realized,

00:05:07.636 --> 00:05:11.483
"Hey! It's the very thing
in which I can cast general relativity."

00:05:11.507 --> 00:05:14.619
So, you never know. It is a mystery.

00:05:15.056 --> 00:05:16.273
It is a mystery.

00:05:16.297 --> 00:05:19.593
CA: So, here's a mathematical
piece of ingenuity.

00:05:19.617 --> 00:05:20.959
Tell us about this.

00:05:20.983 --> 00:05:26.907
JS: Well, that's a ball -- it's a sphere,
and it has a lattice around it --

00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:28.504
you know, those squares.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:35.603
What I'm going to show here was
originally observed by [Leonhard] Euler,

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:37.881
the great mathematician, in the 1700s.

00:05:38.223 --> 00:05:43.404
And it gradually grew to be
a very important field in mathematics:

00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:45.762
algebraic topology, geometry.

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.403
That paper up there had its roots in this.

00:05:51.427 --> 00:05:53.261
So, here's this thing:

00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:57.737
it has eight vertices,
12 edges, six faces.

00:05:57.761 --> 00:06:01.591
And if you look at the difference --
vertices minus edges plus faces --

00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:02.767
you get two.

00:06:02.791 --> 00:06:05.010
OK, well, two. That's a good number.

00:06:05.034 --> 00:06:09.282
Here's a different way of doing it --
these are triangles covering --

00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:13.883
this has 12 vertices and 30 edges

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:18.102
and 20 faces, 20 tiles.

00:06:18.576 --> 00:06:23.167
And vertices minus edges
plus faces still equals two.

00:06:23.191 --> 00:06:26.038
And in fact, you could do this
any which way --

00:06:26.062 --> 00:06:29.460
cover this thing with all kinds
of polygons and triangles

00:06:29.484 --> 00:06:30.804
and mix them up.

00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:34.107
And you take vertices minus edges
plus faces -- you'll get two.

00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:35.742
Here's a different shape.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.730
This is a torus, or the surface
of a doughnut: 16 vertices

00:06:41.754 --> 00:06:45.998
covered by these rectangles,
32 edges, 16 faces.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.214
Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero.

00:06:49.238 --> 00:06:50.713
It'll always come out to zero.

00:06:50.737 --> 00:06:55.047
Every time you cover a torus
with squares or triangles

00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:59.006
or anything like that,
you're going to get zero.

00:07:00.514 --> 00:07:02.904
So, this is called
the Euler characteristic.

00:07:02.928 --> 00:07:06.377
And it's what's called
a topological invariant.

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:08.005
It's pretty amazing.

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:10.820
No matter how you do it,
you're always get the same answer.

00:07:10.844 --> 00:07:17.143
So that was the first sort of thrust,
from the mid-1700s,

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:20.936
into a subject which is now called
algebraic topology.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.943
CA: And your own work
took an idea like this and moved it

00:07:23.967 --> 00:07:26.416
into higher-dimensional theory,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.528
higher-dimensional objects,
and found new invariances?

00:07:29.552 --> 00:07:34.195
JS: Yes. Well, there were already
higher-dimensional invariants:

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:38.676
Pontryagin classes --
actually, there were Chern classes.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.248
There were a bunch
of these types of invariants.

00:07:42.272 --> 00:07:46.407
I was struggling to work on one of them

00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:50.634
and model it sort of combinatorially,

00:07:50.658 --> 00:07:53.680
instead of the way it was typically done,

00:07:53.704 --> 00:07:58.063
and that led to this work
and we uncovered some new things.

00:07:58.087 --> 00:08:01.588
But if it wasn't for Mr. Euler --

00:08:01.612 --> 00:08:05.593
who wrote almost 70 volumes of mathematics

00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:07.348
and had 13 children,

00:08:07.372 --> 00:08:13.814
who he apparently would dandle on his knee
while he was writing --

00:08:13.838 --> 00:08:19.612
if it wasn't for Mr. Euler, there wouldn't
perhaps be these invariants.

00:08:20.157 --> 00:08:24.254
CA: OK, so that's at least given us
a flavor of that amazing mind in there.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.347
Let's talk about Renaissance.

00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:32.227
Because you took that amazing mind
and having been a code-cracker at the NSA,

00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:35.480
you started to become a code-cracker
in the financial industry.

00:08:35.504 --> 00:08:38.194
I think you probably didn't buy
efficient market theory.

00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:44.605
Somehow you found a way of creating
astonishing returns over two decades.

00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:46.300
The way it's been explained to me,

00:08:46.324 --> 00:08:49.823
what's remarkable about what you did
wasn't just the size of the returns,

00:08:49.847 --> 00:08:53.730
it's that you took them
with surprisingly low volatility and risk,

00:08:53.754 --> 00:08:55.578
compared with other hedge funds.

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:57.531
So how on earth did you do this, Jim?

00:08:58.071 --> 00:09:02.182
JS: I did it by assembling
a wonderful group of people.

00:09:02.206 --> 00:09:06.162
When I started doing trading, I had
gotten a little tired of mathematics.

00:09:06.186 --> 00:09:10.109
I was in my late 30s,
I had a little money.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.642
I started trading and it went very well.

00:09:13.063 --> 00:09:15.811
I made quite a lot of money
with pure luck.

00:09:15.835 --> 00:09:17.501
I mean, I think it was pure luck.

00:09:17.525 --> 00:09:19.634
It certainly wasn't mathematical modeling.

00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:23.489
But in looking at the data,
after a while I realized:

00:09:23.513 --> 00:09:26.066
it looks like there's some structure here.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.787
And I hired a few mathematicians,
and we started making some models --

00:09:29.811 --> 00:09:34.076
just the kind of thing we did back
at IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses].

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.933
You design an algorithm,
you test it out on a computer.

00:09:36.957 --> 00:09:39.123
Does it work? Doesn't it work? And so on.

00:09:39.443 --> 00:09:40.922
CA: Can we take a look at this?

00:09:40.946 --> 00:09:45.487
Because here's a typical graph
of some commodity.

00:09:46.487 --> 00:09:50.528
I look at that, and I say,
"That's just a random, up-and-down walk --

00:09:50.552 --> 00:09:53.414
maybe a slight upward trend
over that whole period of time."

00:09:53.438 --> 00:09:55.551
How on earth could you trade
looking at that,

00:09:55.575 --> 00:09:57.901
and see something that wasn't just random?

00:09:57.925 --> 00:10:01.172
JS: In the old days -- this is
kind of a graph from the old days,

00:10:01.196 --> 00:10:05.480
commodities or currencies
had a tendency to trend.

00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:11.559
Not necessarily the very light trend
you see here, but trending in periods.

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:15.639
And if you decided, OK,
I'm going to predict today,

00:10:15.663 --> 00:10:20.631
by the average move in the past 20 days --

00:10:20.655 --> 00:10:23.762
maybe that would be a good prediction,
and I'd make some money.

00:10:23.786 --> 00:10:29.394
And in fact, years ago,
such a system would work --

00:10:29.418 --> 00:10:31.809
not beautifully, but it would work.

00:10:31.833 --> 00:10:34.342
You'd make money, you'd lose
money, you'd make money.

00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:36.564
But this is a year's worth of days,

00:10:36.588 --> 00:10:40.829
and you'd make a little money
during that period.

00:10:41.884 --> 00:10:43.842
It's a very vestigial system.

00:10:44.525 --> 00:10:48.054
CA: So you would test
a bunch of lengths of trends in time

00:10:48.078 --> 00:10:50.514
and see whether, for example,

00:10:50.538 --> 00:10:54.019
a 10-day trend or a 15-day trend
was predictive of what happened next.

00:10:54.043 --> 00:11:00.805
JS: Sure, you would try all those things
and see what worked best.

00:11:01.515 --> 00:11:04.865
Trend-following would
have been great in the '60s,

00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:07.021
and it was sort of OK in the '70s.

00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:08.918
By the '80s, it wasn't.

00:11:08.942 --> 00:11:11.759
CA: Because everyone could see that.

00:11:11.783 --> 00:11:14.565
So, how did you stay ahead of the pack?

00:11:15.046 --> 00:11:21.178
JS: We stayed ahead of the pack
by finding other approaches --

00:11:21.202 --> 00:11:23.943
shorter-term approaches to some extent.

00:11:25.107 --> 00:11:28.454
The real thing was to gather
a tremendous amount of data --

00:11:28.478 --> 00:11:32.056
and we had to get it by hand
in the early days.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.546
We went down to the Federal Reserve
and copied interest rate histories

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.835
and stuff like that,
because it didn't exist on computers.

00:11:38.859 --> 00:11:40.502
We got a lot of data.

00:11:40.526 --> 00:11:44.686
And very smart people -- that was the key.

00:11:45.463 --> 00:11:49.239
I didn't really know how to hire
people to do fundamental trading.

00:11:49.749 --> 00:11:52.698
I had hired a few -- some made money,
some didn't make money.

00:11:52.722 --> 00:11:54.602
I couldn't make a business out of that.

00:11:54.626 --> 00:11:56.668
But I did know how to hire scientists,

00:11:56.692 --> 00:12:00.081
because I have some taste
in that department.

00:12:00.105 --> 00:12:01.943
So, that's what we did.

00:12:01.967 --> 00:12:05.198
And gradually these models
got better and better,

00:12:05.222 --> 00:12:06.557
and better and better.

00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:09.795
CA: You're credited with doing
something remarkable at Renaissance,

00:12:09.819 --> 00:12:12.420
which is building this culture,
this group of people,

00:12:12.444 --> 00:12:15.586
who weren't just hired guns
who could be lured away by money.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.522
Their motivation was doing
exciting mathematics and science.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.259
JS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:25.863
But some of it was money.

00:12:25.887 --> 00:12:27.280
CA: They made a lot of money.

00:12:27.304 --> 00:12:29.841
JS: I can't say that no one came
because of the money.

00:12:29.865 --> 00:12:32.118
I think a lot of them
came because of the money.

00:12:32.142 --> 00:12:34.163
But they also came
because it would be fun.

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:36.675
CA: What role did machine learning
play in all this?

00:12:36.699 --> 00:12:39.763
JS: In a certain sense,
what we did was machine learning.

00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:47.170
You look at a lot of data, and you try
to simulate different predictive schemes,

00:12:47.194 --> 00:12:49.376
until you get better and better at it.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.167
It doesn't necessarily feed back on itself
the way we did things.

00:12:53.191 --> 00:12:55.500
But it worked.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.209
CA: So these different predictive schemes
can be really quite wild and unexpected.

00:13:00.233 --> 00:13:02.147
I mean, you looked at everything, right?

00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:05.488
You looked at the weather,
length of dresses, political opinion.

00:13:05.512 --> 00:13:08.349
JS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try.

00:13:08.373 --> 00:13:10.430
CA: What sort of things?

00:13:10.454 --> 00:13:11.612
JS: Well, everything.

00:13:11.636 --> 00:13:14.900
Everything is grist for the mill --
except hem lengths.

00:13:16.852 --> 00:13:19.152
Weather, annual reports,

00:13:19.176 --> 00:13:23.908
quarterly reports, historic data itself,
volumes, you name it.

00:13:23.932 --> 00:13:25.083
Whatever there is.

00:13:25.107 --> 00:13:27.728
We take in terabytes of data a day.

00:13:27.752 --> 00:13:31.876
And store it away and massage it
and get it ready for analysis.

00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:34.828
You're looking for anomalies.

00:13:34.852 --> 00:13:37.805
You're looking for -- like you said,

00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:40.281
the efficient market
hypothesis is not correct.

00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:43.772
CA: But any one anomaly
might be just a random thing.

00:13:43.796 --> 00:13:47.454
So, is the secret here to just look
at multiple strange anomalies,

00:13:47.478 --> 00:13:48.806
and see when they align?

00:13:49.238 --> 00:13:52.451
JS: Any one anomaly
might be a random thing;

00:13:52.475 --> 00:13:55.514
however, if you have enough data
you can tell that it's not.

00:13:55.538 --> 00:14:00.488
You can see an anomaly that's persistent
for a sufficiently long time --

00:14:00.512 --> 00:14:05.487
the probability of it being
random is not high.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:10.369
But these things fade after a while;
anomalies can get washed out.

00:14:10.393 --> 00:14:12.813
So you have to keep on top
of the business.

00:14:12.837 --> 00:14:15.509
CA: A lot of people look
at the hedge fund industry now

00:14:15.533 --> 00:14:19.931
and are sort of ... shocked by it,

00:14:19.955 --> 00:14:22.127
by how much wealth is created there,

00:14:22.151 --> 00:14:24.396
and how much talent is going into it.

00:14:25.523 --> 00:14:29.529
Do you have any worries
about that industry,

00:14:29.553 --> 00:14:31.967
and perhaps the financial
industry in general?

00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:34.695
Kind of being on a runaway train that's --

00:14:34.719 --> 00:14:38.749
I don't know --
helping increase inequality?

00:14:38.773 --> 00:14:42.604
How would you champion what's happening
in the hedge fund industry?

00:14:42.628 --> 00:14:45.236
JS: I think in the last
three or four years,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.363
hedge funds have not done especially well.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:48.787
We've done dandy,

00:14:48.811 --> 00:14:52.812
but the hedge fund industry as a whole
has not done so wonderfully.

00:14:52.836 --> 00:14:57.738
The stock market has been on a roll,
going up as everybody knows,

00:14:57.762 --> 00:15:01.207
and price-earnings ratios have grown.

00:15:01.231 --> 00:15:04.294
So an awful lot of the wealth
that's been created in the last --

00:15:04.318 --> 00:15:07.668
let's say, five or six years --
has not been created by hedge funds.

00:15:08.458 --> 00:15:11.679
People would ask me,
"What's a hedge fund?"

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:13.963
And I'd say, "One and 20."

00:15:13.987 --> 00:15:17.553
Which means -- now it's two and 20 --

00:15:17.577 --> 00:15:20.930
it's two percent fixed fee
and 20 percent of profits.

00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:23.306
Hedge funds are all
different kinds of creatures.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.569
CA: Rumor has it you charge
slightly higher fees than that.

00:15:27.339 --> 00:15:30.420
JS: We charged the highest fees
in the world at one time.

00:15:30.444 --> 00:15:33.670
Five and 44, that's what we charge.

00:15:33.694 --> 00:15:35.092
CA: Five and 44.

00:15:35.116 --> 00:15:38.350
So five percent flat,
44 percent of upside.

00:15:38.374 --> 00:15:41.157
You still made your investors
spectacular amounts of money.

00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:42.633
JS: We made good returns, yes.

00:15:42.657 --> 00:15:45.657
People got very mad:
"How can you charge such high fees?"

00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:47.308
I said, "OK, you can withdraw."

00:15:47.332 --> 00:15:50.150
But "How can I get more?"
was what people were --

00:15:50.174 --> 00:15:51.678
(Laughter)

00:15:51.702 --> 00:15:54.142
But at a certain point,
as I think I told you,

00:15:54.166 --> 00:15:59.341
we bought out all the investors
because there's a capacity to the fund.

00:15:59.365 --> 00:16:02.069
CA: But should we worry
about the hedge fund industry

00:16:02.093 --> 00:16:07.531
attracting too much of the world's
great mathematical and other talent

00:16:07.555 --> 00:16:10.793
to work on that, as opposed
to the many other problems in the world?

00:16:10.817 --> 00:16:12.746
JS: Well, it's not just mathematical.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.449
We hire astronomers and physicists
and things like that.

00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:18.264
I don't think we should worry
about it too much.

00:16:18.288 --> 00:16:21.430
It's still a pretty small industry.

00:16:21.454 --> 00:16:27.451
And in fact, bringing science
into the investing world

00:16:27.475 --> 00:16:29.634
has improved that world.

00:16:29.658 --> 00:16:33.728
It's reduced volatility.
It's increased liquidity.

00:16:33.752 --> 00:16:36.941
Spreads are narrower because
people are trading that kind of stuff.

00:16:36.965 --> 00:16:42.041
So I'm not too worried about Einstein
going off and starting a hedge fund.

00:16:42.478 --> 00:16:46.642
CA: You're at a phase in your life now
where you're actually investing, though,

00:16:46.666 --> 00:16:50.400
at the other end of the supply chain --

00:16:50.424 --> 00:16:54.528
you're actually boosting
mathematics across America.

00:16:54.552 --> 00:16:56.417
This is your wife, Marilyn.

00:16:56.441 --> 00:17:01.197
You're working on
philanthropic issues together.

00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:02.384
Tell me about that.

00:17:02.408 --> 00:17:06.057
JS: Well, Marilyn started --

00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:09.528
there she is up there,
my beautiful wife --

00:17:09.552 --> 00:17:12.524
she started the foundation
about 20 years ago.

00:17:12.548 --> 00:17:13.699
I think '94.

00:17:13.723 --> 00:17:15.818
I claim it was '93, she says it was '94,

00:17:15.842 --> 00:17:18.413
but it was one of those two years.

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:20.572
(Laughter)

00:17:20.596 --> 00:17:27.315
We started the foundation,
just as a convenient way to give charity.

00:17:28.346 --> 00:17:30.853
She kept the books, and so on.

00:17:30.877 --> 00:17:37.591
We did not have a vision at that time,
but gradually a vision emerged --

00:17:37.615 --> 00:17:43.119
which was to focus on math and science,
to focus on basic research.

00:17:43.569 --> 00:17:46.341
And that's what we've done.

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:52.720
Six years ago or so, I left Renaissance
and went to work at the foundation.

00:17:52.744 --> 00:17:54.315
So that's what we do.

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:57.248
CA: And so Math for America
is basically investing

00:17:57.272 --> 00:17:59.910
in math teachers around the country,

00:17:59.934 --> 00:18:03.736
giving them some extra income,
giving them support and coaching.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.811
And really trying
to make that more effective

00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:09.436
and make that a calling
to which teachers can aspire.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:14.250
JS: Yeah -- instead of beating up
the bad teachers,

00:18:14.274 --> 00:18:19.127
which has created morale problems
all through the educational community,

00:18:19.151 --> 00:18:21.592
in particular in math and science,

00:18:21.616 --> 00:18:27.746
we focus on celebrating the good ones
and giving them status.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.701
Yeah, we give them extra money,
15,000 dollars a year.

00:18:30.725 --> 00:18:35.192
We have 800 math and science teachers
in New York City in public schools today,

00:18:35.216 --> 00:18:37.030
as part of a core.

00:18:37.054 --> 00:18:40.740
There's a great morale among them.

00:18:40.764 --> 00:18:43.270
They're staying in the field.

00:18:43.294 --> 00:18:46.189
Next year, it'll be 1,000
and that'll be 10 percent

00:18:46.213 --> 00:18:49.757
of the math and science teachers
in New York [City] public schools.

00:18:49.781 --> 00:18:55.686
(Applause)

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.120
CA: Jim, here's another project
that you've supported philanthropically:

00:18:59.144 --> 00:19:01.541
Research into origins of life, I guess.

00:19:01.565 --> 00:19:03.012
What are we looking at here?

00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:05.418
JS: Well, I'll save that for a second.

00:19:05.442 --> 00:19:07.604
And then I'll tell you
what you're looking at.

00:19:07.628 --> 00:19:10.684
Origins of life is a fascinating question.

00:19:10.708 --> 00:19:12.241
How did we get here?

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.941
Well, there are two questions:

00:19:14.965 --> 00:19:20.833
One is, what is the route
from geology to biology --

00:19:20.857 --> 00:19:22.238
how did we get here?

00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:24.626
And the other question is,
what did we start with?

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.752
What material, if any,
did we have to work with on this route?

00:19:27.776 --> 00:19:30.837
Those are two very,
very interesting questions.

00:19:31.773 --> 00:19:37.607
The first question is a tortuous path
from geology up to RNA

00:19:37.631 --> 00:19:39.889
or something like that --
how did that all work?

00:19:39.913 --> 00:19:42.301
And the other,
what do we have to work with?

00:19:42.325 --> 00:19:44.096
Well, more than we think.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.963
So what's pictured there
is a star in formation.

00:19:49.836 --> 00:19:53.261
Now, every year in our Milky Way,
which has 100 billion stars,

00:19:53.285 --> 00:19:55.780
about two new stars are created.

00:19:55.804 --> 00:19:58.274
Don't ask me how, but they're created.

00:19:58.298 --> 00:20:01.378
And it takes them about a million
years to settle out.

00:20:02.132 --> 00:20:04.308
So, in steady state,

00:20:04.332 --> 00:20:08.180
there are about two million stars
in formation at any time.

00:20:08.204 --> 00:20:11.662
That one is somewhere
along this settling-down period.

00:20:12.067 --> 00:20:15.003
And there's all this crap
sort of circling around it,

00:20:15.027 --> 00:20:16.525
dust and stuff.

00:20:17.479 --> 00:20:20.502
And it'll form probably a solar system,
or whatever it forms.

00:20:20.526 --> 00:20:22.702
But here's the thing --

00:20:22.726 --> 00:20:29.074
in this dust that surrounds a forming star

00:20:29.098 --> 00:20:35.133
have been found, now,
significant organic molecules.

00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:42.097
Molecules not just like methane,
but formaldehyde and cyanide --

00:20:42.121 --> 00:20:48.638
things that are the building blocks --
the seeds, if you will -- of life.

00:20:49.136 --> 00:20:51.828
So, that may be typical.

00:20:52.395 --> 00:20:59.329
And it may be typical
that planets around the universe

00:20:59.353 --> 00:21:02.965
start off with some of these
basic building blocks.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.545
Now does that mean
there's going to be life all around?

00:21:06.569 --> 00:21:07.933
Maybe.

00:21:07.957 --> 00:21:12.084
But it's a question
of how tortuous this path is

00:21:12.108 --> 00:21:16.502
from those frail beginnings,
those seeds, all the way to life.

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:21.718
And most of those seeds
will fall on fallow planets.

00:21:21.742 --> 00:21:23.151
CA: So for you, personally,

00:21:23.175 --> 00:21:25.897
finding an answer to this question
of where we came from,

00:21:25.921 --> 00:21:29.579
of how did this thing happen,
that is something you would love to see.

00:21:29.603 --> 00:21:31.389
JS: Would love to see.

00:21:31.413 --> 00:21:32.903
And like to know --

00:21:32.927 --> 00:21:38.097
if that path is tortuous enough,
and so improbable,

00:21:38.121 --> 00:21:42.875
that no matter what you start with,
we could be a singularity.

00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:44.488
But on the other hand,

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:47.990
given all this organic dust
that's floating around,

00:21:48.014 --> 00:21:51.805
we could have lots of friends out there.

00:21:52.947 --> 00:21:54.108
It'd be great to know.

00:21:54.132 --> 00:21:57.612
CA: Jim, a couple of years ago,
I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk,

00:21:57.636 --> 00:22:00.473
and I asked him the secret of his success,

00:22:00.497 --> 00:22:04.188
and he said taking
physics seriously was it.

00:22:04.696 --> 00:22:08.699
Listening to you, what I hear you saying
is taking math seriously,

00:22:08.723 --> 00:22:11.726
that has infused your whole life.

00:22:12.123 --> 00:22:16.686
It's made you an absolute fortune,
and now it's allowing you to invest

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:21.206
in the futures of thousands and thousands
of kids across America and elsewhere.

00:22:21.567 --> 00:22:24.425
Could it be that science actually works?

00:22:24.449 --> 00:22:27.221
That math actually works?

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:31.617
JS: Well, math certainly works.
Math certainly works.

00:22:31.641 --> 00:22:32.839
But this has been fun.

00:22:32.863 --> 00:22:37.809
Working with Marilyn and giving it away
has been very enjoyable.

00:22:37.833 --> 00:22:40.769
CA: I just find it --
it's an inspirational thought to me,

00:22:40.793 --> 00:22:44.800
that by taking knowledge seriously,
so much more can come from it.

00:22:44.824 --> 00:22:47.842
So thank you for your amazing life,
and for coming here to TED.

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:48.617
Thank you.

00:22:48.651 --> 00:22:49.752
Jim Simons!

00:22:49.806 --> 00:22:54.186
(Applause)
