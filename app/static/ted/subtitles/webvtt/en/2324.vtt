00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.230
Today I'm going to talk about work.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.180
And the question I want to ask
and answer is this:

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.120
"Why do we work?"

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.060
Why do we drag ourselves
out of bed every morning

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.100
instead of living our lives

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.180
just filled with bouncing from one
TED-like adventure to another?

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.010
(Laughter)

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.080
You may be asking yourselves
that very question.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.200
Now, I know of course,
we have to make a living,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.050
but nobody in this room thinks
that that's the answer to the question,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.100
"Why do we work?"

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.100
For folks in this room,
the work we do is challenging,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.010
it's engaging, it's stimulating,
it's meaningful.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.070
And if we're lucky,
it might even be important.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.160
So, we wouldn't work
if we didn't get paid,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.040
but that's not why we do what we do.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.090
And in general,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.160
I think we think that material rewards
are a pretty bad reason

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.090
for doing the work that we do.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.130
When we say of somebody
that he's "in it for the money,"

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.010
we are not just being descriptive.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.090
(Laughter)

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.120
Now, I think this is totally obvious,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.110
but the very obviousness of it
raises what is for me

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.220
an incredibly profound question.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.040
Why, if this is so obvious,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.130
why is it that for the overwhelming
majority of people on the planet,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.010
the work they do
has none of the characteristics

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.200
that get us up and out of bed
and off to the office every morning?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.100
How is it that we allow
the majority of people on the planet

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.100
to do work that is monotonous,
meaningless and soul-deadening?

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.070
Why is it that as capitalism developed,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.120
it created a mode of production,
of goods and services,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.090
in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions
that might come from work were eliminated?

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.100
Workers who do this kind of work,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.060
whether they do it in factories,
in call centers,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.180
or in fulfillment warehouses,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.180
do it for pay.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.000
There is certainly no other earthly reason
to do what they do except for pay.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.070
So the question is, "Why?"

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.220
And here's the answer:

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.100
the answer is technology.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.190
Now, I know, I know --

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.080
yeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation
screws people, blah blah --

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.200
that's not what I mean.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.120
I'm not talking about
the kind of technology

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.120
that has enveloped our lives,
and that people come to TED to hear about.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.110
I'm not talking about
the technology of things,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.100
profound though that is.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.090
I'm talking about another technology.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.080
I'm talking about the technology of ideas.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.140
I call it, "idea technology" --

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.210
how clever of me.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.030
(Laughter)

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.140
In addition to creating things,
science creates ideas.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.120
Science creates ways of understanding.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.070
And in the social sciences,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.060
the ways of understanding that get created
are ways of understanding ourselves.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.130
And they have an enormous influence
on how we think, what we aspire to,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.030
and how we act.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.200
If you think your poverty
is God's will, you pray.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.160
If you think your poverty is the result
of your own inadequacy,

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.110
you shrink into despair.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.210
And if you think your poverty is
the result of oppression and domination,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.220
then you rise up in revolt.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.020
Whether your response to poverty
is resignation or revolution,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.200
depends on how you understand
the sources of your poverty.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.100
This is the role that ideas play
in shaping us as human beings,

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.040
and this is why idea technology may be
the most profoundly important technology

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.560
that science gives us.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.020
And there's something special
about idea technology,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.030
that makes it different
from the technology of things.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.180
With things, if the technology sucks,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.230
it just vanishes, right?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.110
Bad technology disappears.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.010
With ideas --

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.050
false ideas about human beings
will not go away

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.480
if people believe that they're true.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.100
Because if people believe
that they're true,

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.150
they create ways of living
and institutions

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.010
that are consistent
with these very false ideas.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.040
And that's how the industrial revolution
created a factory system

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.190
in which there was really nothing you
could possibly get out of your day's work,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.070
except for the pay at the end of the day.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.070
Because the father --
one of the fathers

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.120
of the Industrial Revolution,
Adam Smith --

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.100
was convinced that human beings
were by their very natures lazy,

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.110
and wouldn't do anything
unless you made it worth their while,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.110
and the way you made it worth their while

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.110
was by incentivizing,
by giving them rewards.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.060
That was the only reason
anyone ever did anything.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.210
So we created a factory system consistent
with that false view of human nature.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.180
But once that system
of production was in place,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.180
there was really no other way
for people to operate,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.030
except in a way that was consistent
with Adam Smith's vision.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.150
So the work example is merely an example

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.210
of how false ideas
can create a circumstance

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.070
that ends up making them true.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.120
It is not true

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.190
that you "just can't get
good help anymore."

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.040
It is true

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.030
that you "can't get good help anymore"

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.020
when you give people work to do
that is demeaning and soulless.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.090
And interestingly enough, Adam Smith --

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.060
the same guy who gave us
this incredible invention

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.170
of mass production, and division of labor

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.220
-- understood this.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.170
He said, of people who worked
in assembly lines,

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.200
of men who worked
in assembly lines, he says:

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:49.020
"He generally becomes as stupid as it is
possible for a human being to become."

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.190
Now, notice the word here is "become."

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.220
"He generally becomes as stupid as it is
possible for a human being to become."

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.120
Whether he intended it or not,
what Adam Smith was telling us there,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.030
is that the very shape of the institution
within which people work

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.130
creates people who are fitted
to the demands of that institution

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.030
and deprives people of the opportunity

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.510
to derive the kinds of satisfactions
from their work that we take for granted.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.090
The thing about science --
natural science --

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.210
is that we can spin fantastic
theories about the cosmos,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.160
and have complete confidence

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.430
that the cosmos is completely
indifferent to our theories.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.010
It's going to work the same damn way

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.050
no matter what theories
we have about the cosmos.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:42.080
But we do have to worry about
the theories we have of human nature,

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.160
because human nature will be changed
by the theories we have

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.160
that are designed to explain
and help us understand human beings.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.140
The distinguished anthropologist,
Clifford Geertz, said, years ago,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.030
that human beings
are the "unfinished animals."

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.050
And what he meant by that
was that it is only human nature

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.130
to have a human nature

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.000
that is very much the product
of the society in which people live.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.110
That human nature,
that is to say our human nature,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.090
is much more created
than it is discovered.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.140
We design human nature

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.070
by designing the institutions
within which people live and work.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.210
And so you people --

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.030
pretty much the closest I ever get
to being with masters of the universe --

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.020
you people should be asking
yourself a question,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.050
as you go back home
to run your organizations.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.130
Just what kind of human nature
do you want to help design?

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.200
Thank you.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.080
(Applause)

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.130
Thanks.
