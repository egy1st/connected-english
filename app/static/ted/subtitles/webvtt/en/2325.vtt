WEBVTT

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:05.008
Well, we all need a reason to wake up.

00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:09.271
For me, it just took 11,000 volts.

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:12.742
I know you're too polite to ask,

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.401
so I will tell you.

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:17.577
One night, sophomore year of college,

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:21.299
just back from Thanksgiving holiday,

00:00:21.323 --> 00:00:23.975
a few of my friends and I
were horsing around,

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.564
and we decided to climb atop
a parked commuter train.

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:31.281
It was just sitting there,
with the wires that run overhead.

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:34.407
Somehow, that seemed
like a great idea at the time.

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:37.286
We'd certainly done stupider things.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.291
I scurried up the ladder on the back,

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:43.037
and when I stood up,

00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:46.643
the electrical current entered my arm,

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.207
blew down and out my feet,
and that was that.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.288
Would you believe that watch still works?

00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:57.423
Takes a licking!

00:00:57.447 --> 00:00:58.478
(Laughter)

00:00:58.502 --> 00:01:00.811
My father wears it now in solidarity.

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:09.318
That night began my formal relationship
with death -- my death --

00:01:09.342 --> 00:01:13.150
and it also began
my long run as a patient.

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:14.328
It's a good word.

00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:16.079
It means one who suffers.

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:18.266
So I guess we're all patients.

00:01:19.607 --> 00:01:21.973
Now, the American health care system

00:01:21.997 --> 00:01:25.118
has more than its fair share
of dysfunction --

00:01:25.142 --> 00:01:27.202
to match its brilliance, to be sure.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.202
I'm a physician now,
a hospice and palliative medicine doc,

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.472
so I've seen care from both sides.

00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:38.975
And believe me: almost everyone
who goes into healthcare

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.136
really means well -- I mean, truly.

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:46.807
But we who work in it
are also unwitting agents

00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:51.075
for a system that too often
does not serve.

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:53.156
Why?

00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:57.005
Well, there's actually a pretty easy
answer to that question,

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:59.277
and it explains a lot:

00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:05.259
because healthcare was designed
with diseases, not people, at its center.

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:09.325
Which is to say, of course,
it was badly designed.

00:02:10.158 --> 00:02:16.210
And nowhere are the effects
of bad design more heartbreaking

00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:19.569
or the opportunity
for good design more compelling

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:21.734
than at the end of life,

00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:25.114
where things are so distilled
and concentrated.

00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:28.020
There are no do-overs.

00:02:30.073 --> 00:02:34.564
My purpose today is
to reach out across disciplines

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:38.955
and invite design thinking
into this big conversation.

00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:44.852
That is, to bring intention and creativity

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:47.645
to the experience of dying.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:53.268
We have a monumental
opportunity in front of us,

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:57.633
before one of the few universal issues

00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:00.967
as individuals as well as a civil society:

00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:04.907
to rethink and redesign how it is we die.

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.079
So let's begin at the end.

00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:15.546
For most people, the scariest thing
about death isn't being dead,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.389
it's dying, suffering.

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:19.184
It's a key distinction.

00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:22.629
To get underneath this,
it can be very helpful

00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:27.007
to tease out suffering
which is necessary as it is,

00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:29.696
from suffering we can change.

00:03:30.317 --> 00:03:35.553
The former is a natural,
essential part of life, part of the deal,

00:03:35.577 --> 00:03:40.691
and to this we are called
to make space, adjust, grow.

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:48.359
It can be really good
to realize forces larger than ourselves.

00:03:49.098 --> 00:03:52.222
They bring proportionality,

00:03:52.246 --> 00:03:54.565
like a cosmic right-sizing.

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.213
After my limbs were gone,

00:03:59.237 --> 00:04:03.823
that loss, for example,
became fact, fixed --

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:07.160
necessarily part of my life,

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:13.300
and I learned that I could no more
reject this fact than reject myself.

00:04:15.173 --> 00:04:17.794
It took me a while,
but I learned it eventually.

00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:21.016
Now, another great thing
about necessary suffering

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.548
is that it is the very thing

00:04:24.572 --> 00:04:29.975
that unites caregiver and care receiver --

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:31.252
human beings.

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:36.903
This, we are finally realizing,
is where healing happens.

00:04:37.673 --> 00:04:41.193
Yes, compassion -- literally,
as we learned yesterday --

00:04:41.217 --> 00:04:42.645
suffering together.

00:04:44.672 --> 00:04:48.010
Now, on the systems side,
on the other hand,

00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:51.892
so much of the suffering
is unnecessary, invented.

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:54.650
It serves no good purpose.

00:04:54.674 --> 00:04:58.975
But the good news is,
since this brand of suffering is made up,

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.483
well, we can change it.

00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:04.335
How we die is indeed
something we can affect.

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:10.499
Making the system sensitive
to this fundamental distinction

00:05:10.523 --> 00:05:13.975
between necessary
and unnecessary suffering

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:17.689
gives us our first of three
design cues for the day.

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:22.828
After all, our role as caregivers,
as people who care,

00:05:22.852 --> 00:05:27.514
is to relieve suffering --
not add to the pile.

00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:32.163
True to the tenets of palliative care,

00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:35.860
I function as something
of a reflective advocate,

00:05:35.884 --> 00:05:38.003
as much as prescribing physician.

00:05:39.177 --> 00:05:45.198
Quick aside: palliative care -- a very
important field but poorly understood --

00:05:45.222 --> 00:05:48.176
while it includes, it is not
limited to end of life care.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.041
It is not limited to hospice.

00:05:50.811 --> 00:05:54.268
It's simply about comfort
and living well at any stage.

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:58.038
So please know that you don't
have to be dying anytime soon

00:05:58.062 --> 00:05:59.749
to benefit from palliative care.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.730
Now, let me introduce you to Frank.

00:06:05.768 --> 00:06:06.983
Sort of makes this point.

00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:09.037
I've been seeing Frank now for years.

00:06:09.061 --> 00:06:13.255
He's living with advancing prostate cancer
on top of long-standing HIV.

00:06:14.197 --> 00:06:16.183
We work on his bone pain and his fatigue,

00:06:16.207 --> 00:06:20.921
but most of the time we spend thinking
out loud together about his life --

00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:22.310
really, about our lives.

00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:24.731
In this way, Frank grieves.

00:06:25.207 --> 00:06:28.986
In this way, he keeps up with
his losses as they roll in,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.159
so that he's ready to take in
the next moment.

00:06:33.524 --> 00:06:37.695
Loss is one thing,
but regret, quite another.

00:06:39.243 --> 00:06:41.200
Frank has always been an adventurer --

00:06:41.224 --> 00:06:44.065
he looks like something
out of a Norman Rockwell painting --

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:45.653
and no fan of regret.

00:06:46.566 --> 00:06:49.247
So it wasn't surprising
when he came into clinic one day,

00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:52.007
saying he wanted to raft
down the Colorado River.

00:06:53.142 --> 00:06:54.817
Was this a good idea?

00:06:55.268 --> 00:06:59.472
With all the risks to his safety
and his health, some would say no.

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:03.062
Many did, but he went for it,
while he still could.

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:07.610
It was a glorious, marvelous trip:

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:14.250
freezing water, blistering dry heat,
scorpions, snakes,

00:07:14.274 --> 00:07:19.705
wildlife howling off the flaming walls
of the Grand Canyon --

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:23.273
all the glorious side of the world
beyond our control.

00:07:24.492 --> 00:07:26.382
Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic,

00:07:26.406 --> 00:07:28.693
is exactly the kind
so many of us would make,

00:07:28.717 --> 00:07:34.914
if we only had the support to figure out
what is best for ourselves over time.

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:40.660
So much of what we're talking about today
is a shift in perspective.

00:07:42.723 --> 00:07:44.975
After my accident,
when I went back to college,

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:47.365
I changed my major to art history.

00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:52.395
Studying visual art, I figured
I'd learn something about how to see --

00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:57.079
a really potent lesson
for a kid who couldn't change

00:07:57.103 --> 00:07:59.144
so much of what he was seeing.

00:08:00.602 --> 00:08:04.340
Perspective, that kind of alchemy
we humans get to play with,

00:08:04.364 --> 00:08:06.874
turning anguish into a flower.

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:13.791
Flash forward: now I work
at an amazing place in San Francisco

00:08:13.815 --> 00:08:16.054
called the Zen Hospice Project,

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:19.698
where we have a little ritual
that helps with this shift in perspective.

00:08:20.405 --> 00:08:23.466
When one of our residents dies,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.960
the mortuary men come, and as we're
wheeling the body out through the garden,

00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:30.014
heading for the gate, we pause.

00:08:30.038 --> 00:08:32.223
Anyone who wants --

00:08:32.247 --> 00:08:34.971
fellow residents, family,
nurses, volunteers,

00:08:34.995 --> 00:08:37.439
the hearse drivers too, now --

00:08:37.463 --> 00:08:41.890
shares a story or a song or silence,

00:08:41.914 --> 00:08:44.702
as we sprinkle the body
with flower petals.

00:08:45.282 --> 00:08:47.586
It takes a few minutes;

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.975
it's a sweet, simple parting image
to usher in grief with warmth,

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:54.710
rather than repugnance.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:01.106
Contrast that with the typical experience
in the hospital setting,

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:05.994
much like this -- floodlit room
lined with tubes and beeping machines

00:09:06.018 --> 00:09:10.186
and blinking lights that don't stop
even when the patient's life has.

00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:14.445
Cleaning crew swoops in,
the body's whisked away,

00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:19.497
and it all feels as though that person
had never really existed.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.693
Well-intended, of course,
in the name of sterility,

00:09:23.717 --> 00:09:27.213
but hospitals tend to assault our senses,

00:09:27.237 --> 00:09:32.741
and the most we might hope for
within those walls is numbness --

00:09:32.765 --> 00:09:37.007
anesthetic, literally
the opposite of aesthetic.

00:09:38.499 --> 00:09:42.804
I revere hospitals for what they can do;
I am alive because of them.

00:09:44.096 --> 00:09:46.213
But we ask too much of our hospitals.

00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:51.029
They are places for acute trauma
and treatable illness.

00:09:51.053 --> 00:09:55.078
They are no place to live and die;
that's not what they were designed for.

00:09:58.078 --> 00:10:00.378
Now mind you -- I am not
giving up on the notion

00:10:00.402 --> 00:10:03.612
that our institutions
can become more humane.

00:10:04.057 --> 00:10:06.438
Beauty can be found anywhere.

00:10:09.092 --> 00:10:11.364
I spent a few months in a burn unit

00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:14.136
at St. Barnabas Hospital
in Livingston, New Jersey,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.317
where I got really
great care at every turn,

00:10:18.341 --> 00:10:20.538
including good
palliative care for my pain.

00:10:21.415 --> 00:10:24.260
And one night, it began to snow outside.

00:10:25.426 --> 00:10:29.341
I remember my nurses
complaining about driving through it.

00:10:30.103 --> 00:10:32.287
And there was no window in my room,

00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:35.617
but it was great to just imagine it
coming down all sticky.

00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:41.233
Next day, one of my nurses
smuggled in a snowball for me.

00:10:41.257 --> 00:10:42.890
She brought it in to the unit.

00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:50.139
I cannot tell you the rapture I felt
holding that in my hand,

00:10:50.163 --> 00:10:53.212
and the coldness dripping
onto my burning skin;

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:55.546
the miracle of it all,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.329
the fascination as I watched it melt
and turn into water.

00:11:03.293 --> 00:11:05.424
In that moment,

00:11:05.448 --> 00:11:09.936
just being any part of this planet
in this universe mattered more to me

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.059
than whether I lived or died.

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:15.206
That little snowball packed
all the inspiration I needed

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.435
to both try to live
and be OK if I did not.

00:11:19.176 --> 00:11:22.060
In a hospital, that's a stolen moment.

00:11:24.356 --> 00:11:27.745
In my work over the years,
I've known many people

00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:29.596
who were ready to go, ready to die.

00:11:31.192 --> 00:11:35.975
Not because they had found
some final peace or transcendence,

00:11:35.999 --> 00:11:40.308
but because they were so repulsed
by what their lives had become --

00:11:42.553 --> 00:11:47.102
in a word, cut off, or ugly.

00:11:51.394 --> 00:11:57.480
There are already record numbers of us
living with chronic and terminal illness,

00:11:57.504 --> 00:11:58.956
and into ever older age.

00:11:59.947 --> 00:12:04.747
And we are nowhere near ready
or prepared for this silver tsunami.

00:12:07.335 --> 00:12:10.596
We need an infrastructure
dynamic enough to handle

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.684
these seismic shifts in our population.

00:12:15.637 --> 00:12:18.657
Now is the time to create
something new, something vital.

00:12:18.681 --> 00:12:21.041
I know we can because we have to.

00:12:21.065 --> 00:12:23.087
The alternative is just unacceptable.

00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:25.533
And the key ingredients are known:

00:12:25.557 --> 00:12:29.231
policy, education and training,

00:12:29.255 --> 00:12:31.317
systems, bricks and mortar.

00:12:32.642 --> 00:12:36.448
We have tons of input
for designers of all stripes to work with.

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:39.004
We know, for example, from research

00:12:39.028 --> 00:12:42.514
what's most important to people
who are closer to death:

00:12:42.538 --> 00:12:49.503
comfort; feeling unburdened
and unburdening to those they love;

00:12:49.527 --> 00:12:54.769
existential peace; and a sense
of wonderment and spirituality.

00:12:56.896 --> 00:13:00.654
Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years,

00:13:00.678 --> 00:13:04.321
we've learned much more
from our residents in subtle detail.

00:13:05.662 --> 00:13:08.127
Little things aren't so little.

00:13:09.499 --> 00:13:10.673
Take Janette.

00:13:10.697 --> 00:13:14.184
She finds it harder to breathe
one day to the next due to ALS.

00:13:14.208 --> 00:13:15.358
Well, guess what?

00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:19.499
She wants to start smoking again --

00:13:19.523 --> 00:13:22.451
and French cigarettes, if you please.

00:13:24.786 --> 00:13:27.009
Not out of some self-destructive bent,

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:30.992
but to feel her lungs filled
while she has them.

00:13:32.786 --> 00:13:33.983
Priorities change.

00:13:35.556 --> 00:13:38.027
Or Kate -- she just wants to know

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:42.086
her dog Austin is lying
at the foot of her bed,

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.827
his cold muzzle against her dry skin,

00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:48.574
instead of more chemotherapy
coursing through her veins --

00:13:48.598 --> 00:13:49.779
she's done that.

00:13:50.849 --> 00:13:55.865
Sensuous, aesthetic gratification,
where in a moment, in an instant,

00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:59.241
we are rewarded for just being.

00:14:03.373 --> 00:14:07.655
So much of it comes down to
loving our time by way of the senses,

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:12.971
by way of the body -- the very thing
doing the living and the dying.

00:14:14.258 --> 00:14:15.817
Probably the most poignant room

00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:18.094
in the Zen Hospice guest house
is our kitchen,

00:14:18.118 --> 00:14:20.155
which is a little strange when you realize

00:14:20.179 --> 00:14:23.992
that so many of our residents
can eat very little, if anything at all.

00:14:24.016 --> 00:14:29.886
But we realize we are providing
sustenance on several levels:

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.976
smell, a symbolic plane.

00:14:34.356 --> 00:14:39.273
Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff
happening under our roof,

00:14:39.297 --> 00:14:43.031
one of the most tried and true
interventions we know of,

00:14:43.055 --> 00:14:46.548
is to bake cookies.

00:14:58.144 --> 00:14:59.748
As long as we have our senses --

00:14:59.772 --> 00:15:01.784
even just one --

00:15:01.808 --> 00:15:05.217
we have at least
the possibility of accessing

00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:08.409
what makes us feel human, connected.

00:15:10.999 --> 00:15:13.785
Imagine the ripples of this notion

00:15:13.809 --> 00:15:16.594
for the millions of people
living and dying with dementia.

00:15:17.554 --> 00:15:21.819
Primal sensorial delights that say
the things we don't have words for,

00:15:21.843 --> 00:15:24.717
impulses that make us stay present --

00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:27.546
no need for a past or a future.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:36.474
So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out
of the system was our first design cue,

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:41.263
then tending to dignity
by way of the senses,

00:15:41.287 --> 00:15:45.079
by way of the body --
the aesthetic realm --

00:15:45.103 --> 00:15:46.960
is design cue number two.

00:15:47.944 --> 00:15:51.750
Now this gets us quickly to the third
and final bit for today;

00:15:51.774 --> 00:15:58.638
namely, we need to lift our sights,
to set our sights on well-being,

00:15:58.662 --> 00:16:01.975
so that life and health and healthcare

00:16:01.999 --> 00:16:04.384
can become about making life
more wonderful,

00:16:04.408 --> 00:16:06.852
rather than just less horrible.

00:16:08.196 --> 00:16:09.352
Beneficence.

00:16:10.999 --> 00:16:13.134
Here, this gets right at the distinction

00:16:13.158 --> 00:16:18.292
between a disease-centered and a patient-
or human-centered model of care,

00:16:18.316 --> 00:16:21.777
and here is where caring
becomes a creative, generative,

00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:23.643
even playful act.

00:16:24.657 --> 00:16:26.657
"Play" may sound like a funny word here.

00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:30.591
But it is also one of our
highest forms of adaptation.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:35.274
Consider every major compulsory effort
it takes to be human.

00:16:35.298 --> 00:16:37.801
The need for food has birthed cuisine.

00:16:37.825 --> 00:16:40.413
The need for shelter
has given rise to architecture.

00:16:40.437 --> 00:16:42.643
The need for cover, fashion.

00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:45.398
And for being subjected to the clock,

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:48.949
well, we invented music.

00:16:51.766 --> 00:16:54.975
So, since dying
is a necessary part of life,

00:16:54.999 --> 00:16:57.630
what might we create with this fact?

00:17:00.054 --> 00:17:03.430
By "play" I am in no way suggesting
we take a light approach to dying

00:17:03.454 --> 00:17:06.093
or that we mandate
any particular way of dying.

00:17:06.117 --> 00:17:08.975
There are mountains of sorrow
that cannot move,

00:17:08.999 --> 00:17:12.066
and one way or another,
we will all kneel there.

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:16.500
Rather, I am asking that we make space --

00:17:16.524 --> 00:17:22.267
physical, psychic room, to allow life
to play itself all the way out --

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.648
so that rather than just
getting out of the way,

00:17:25.672 --> 00:17:30.489
aging and dying can become
a process of crescendo through to the end.

00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:36.772
We can't solve for death.

00:17:38.283 --> 00:17:40.590
I know some of you are working on this.

00:17:40.614 --> 00:17:44.289
(Laughter)

00:17:45.003 --> 00:17:46.815
Meanwhile, we can --

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:48.855
(Laughter)

00:17:48.879 --> 00:17:51.185
We can design towards it.

00:17:52.042 --> 00:17:53.417
Parts of me died early on,

00:17:53.441 --> 00:17:56.205
and that's something we can all say
one way or another.

00:17:56.583 --> 00:17:59.224
I got to redesign my life
around this fact,

00:17:59.248 --> 00:18:02.588
and I tell you it has been a liberation

00:18:02.612 --> 00:18:05.767
to realize you can always find
a shock of beauty or meaning

00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:08.058
in what life you have left,

00:18:08.082 --> 00:18:10.846
like that snowball lasting
for a perfect moment,

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.168
all the while melting away.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:20.719
If we love such moments ferociously,

00:18:20.743 --> 00:18:23.015
then maybe we can learn to live well --

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:25.126
not in spite of death,

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.736
but because of it.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.696
Let death be what takes us,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.582
not lack of imagination.

00:18:36.868 --> 00:18:38.020
Thank you.

00:18:38.044 --> 00:18:45.964
(Applause)
