WEBVTT

00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:04.643
What I'd like to do
is talk to you a little bit about fear

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:06.356
and the cost of fear

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.654
and the age of fear
from which we are now emerging.

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:14.047
I would like you to feel comfortable
with my doing that

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:19.364
by letting you know that I know something
about fear and anxiety.

00:00:19.388 --> 00:00:21.575
I'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.083
(Laughter)

00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:25.975
I could worry before I could walk.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.505
(Laughter)

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.971
Please, applaud that.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:32.383
(Applause)

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:33.726
Thank you.

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:39.639
But I also grew up in a time
where there was something to fear.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:44.176
We were brought out in the hall
when I was a little kid

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.650
and taught how to put
our coats over our heads

00:00:47.674 --> 00:00:51.427
to protect us from global
thermonuclear war.

00:00:51.838 --> 00:00:56.066
Now even my seven-year-old brain
knew that wasn't going to work.

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:58.337
But I also knew

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:03.085
that global thermonuclear war
was something to be concerned with.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.270
And yet, despite the fact
that we lived for 50 years

00:01:07.294 --> 00:01:09.657
with the threat of such a war,

00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:13.662
the response of our government
and of our society

00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:15.566
was to do wonderful things.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.218
We created the space program
in response to that.

00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:22.339
We built our highway system
in response to that.

00:01:22.363 --> 00:01:25.910
We created the Internet
in response to that.

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:30.127
So sometimes fear can produce
a constructive response.

00:01:30.847 --> 00:01:34.169
But sometimes it can produce
an un-constructive response.

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.975
On September 11, 2001,

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:42.510
19 guys took over four airplanes

00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:44.822
and flew them into a couple of buildings.

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:48.127
They exacted a horrible toll.

00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:52.151
It is not for us to minimize
what that toll was.

00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:59.948
But the response that we had
was clearly disproportionate --

00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:04.850
disproportionate to the point
of verging on the unhinged.

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:08.776
We rearranged the national security
apparatus of the United States

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.640
and of many governments

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:15.382
to address a threat that,
at the time that those attacks took place,

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:16.709
was quite limited.

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:20.164
In fact, according to our
intelligence services,

00:02:20.188 --> 00:02:23.556
on September 11, 2001,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.809
there were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda.

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:29.904
There were just a few thousand terrorists.

00:02:30.357 --> 00:02:33.471
They posed an existential threat

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:34.664
to no one.

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:40.137
But we rearranged our entire
national security apparatus

00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:44.242
in the most sweeping way
since the end of the Second World War.

00:02:44.577 --> 00:02:46.416
We launched two wars.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.773
We spent trillions of dollars.

00:02:48.797 --> 00:02:50.974
We suspended our values.

00:02:50.998 --> 00:02:52.849
We violated international law.

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:54.105
We embraced torture.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.802
We embraced the idea

00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:58.897
that if these 19 guys could do this,
anybody could do it.

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:02.241
And therefore,
for the first time in history,

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:05.213
we were seeing everybody as a threat.

00:03:05.237 --> 00:03:07.089
And what was the result of that?

00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:11.121
Surveillance programs that listened in
on the emails and phone calls

00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:13.310
of entire countries --

00:03:13.334 --> 00:03:15.740
hundreds of millions of people --

00:03:15.764 --> 00:03:18.787
setting aside whether
those countries were our allies,

00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:21.259
setting aside what our interests were.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:26.013
I would argue that 15 years later,

00:03:26.037 --> 00:03:28.430
since today there are more terrorists,

00:03:28.454 --> 00:03:31.996
more terrorist attacks,
more terrorist casualties --

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.360
this by the count
of the U.S. State Department --

00:03:35.384 --> 00:03:38.453
since today the region
from which those attacks emanate

00:03:38.477 --> 00:03:42.166
is more unstable
than at any time in its history,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.870
since the Flood, perhaps,

00:03:45.894 --> 00:03:49.657
we have not succeeded in our response.

00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:52.213
Now you have to ask,
where did we go wrong?

00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:54.687
What did we do?
What was the mistake that was made?

00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:58.840
And you might say, well look,
Washington is a dysfunctional place.

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:00.558
There are political food fights.

00:04:00.582 --> 00:04:04.145
We've turned our discourse
into a cage match.

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.451
And that's true.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.453
But there are bigger problems,
believe it or not, than that dysfunction,

00:04:09.477 --> 00:04:11.345
even though I would argue

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:16.020
that dysfunction that makes it impossible
to get anything done

00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:19.725
in the richest and most powerful
country in the world

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:25.398
is far more dangerous than anything
that a group like ISIS could do,

00:04:25.422 --> 00:04:29.046
because it stops us in our tracks
and it keeps us from progress.

00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:31.655
But there are other problems.

00:04:32.127 --> 00:04:33.291
And the other problems

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:36.871
came from the fact that in Washington
and in many capitals right now,

00:04:36.895 --> 00:04:38.686
we're in a creativity crisis.

00:04:39.108 --> 00:04:41.755
In Washington, in think tanks,

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:44.897
where people are supposed to be
thinking of new ideas,

00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:46.987
you don't get bold new ideas,

00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:49.878
because if you offer up a bold new idea,

00:04:49.902 --> 00:04:51.754
not only are you attacked on Twitter,

00:04:51.778 --> 00:04:55.129
but you will not get confirmed
in a government job.

00:04:55.153 --> 00:05:00.382
Because we are reactive to the heightened
venom of the political debate,

00:05:00.406 --> 00:05:03.516
you get governments that have
an us-versus-them mentality,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.937
tiny groups of people making decisions.

00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:09.243
When you sit in a room with a small group
of people making decisions,

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.426
what do you get?

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.090
You get groupthink.

00:05:12.114 --> 00:05:13.703
Everybody has the same worldview,

00:05:13.727 --> 00:05:16.993
and any view from outside of the group
is seen as a threat.

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:18.596
That's a danger.

00:05:19.258 --> 00:05:23.519
You also have processes
that become reactive to news cycles.

00:05:23.543 --> 00:05:27.836
And so the parts of the U.S. government
that do foresight, that look forward,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.015
that do strategy --

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.802
the parts in other governments
that do this -- can't do it,

00:05:31.826 --> 00:05:33.984
because they're reacting
to the news cycle.

00:05:34.383 --> 00:05:36.287
And so we're not looking ahead.

00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:40.109
On 9/11, we had a crisis
because we were looking the wrong way.

00:05:40.527 --> 00:05:43.954
Today we have a crisis because,
because of 9/11,

00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:46.629
we are still looking
in the wrong direction,

00:05:46.653 --> 00:05:52.501
and we know because we see
transformational trends on the horizon

00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:57.377
that are far more important
than what we saw on 9/11;

00:05:57.401 --> 00:06:01.203
far more important than the threat
posed by these terrorists;

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:04.477
far more important even
than the instability that we've got

00:06:04.501 --> 00:06:08.752
in some areas of the world
that are racked by instability today.

00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:13.821
In fact, the things that we are seeing
in those parts of the world

00:06:13.845 --> 00:06:16.459
may be symptoms.

00:06:16.883 --> 00:06:20.361
They may be a reaction to bigger trends.

00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:25.089
And if we are treating the symptom
and ignoring the bigger trend,

00:06:25.113 --> 00:06:28.177
then we've got far bigger
problems to deal with.

00:06:29.415 --> 00:06:30.912
And so what are those trends?

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.287
Well, to a group like you,

00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:34.802
the trends are apparent.

00:06:36.444 --> 00:06:41.699
We are living at a moment
in which the very fabric of human society

00:06:41.723 --> 00:06:43.512
is being rewoven.

00:06:45.057 --> 00:06:48.277
If you saw the cover of The Economist
a couple of days ago --

00:06:48.301 --> 00:06:51.847
it said that 80 percent
of the people on the planet,

00:06:51.871 --> 00:06:54.804
by the year 2020, would have a smartphone.

00:06:55.564 --> 00:06:59.417
They would have a small computer
connected to the Internet in their pocket.

00:06:59.808 --> 00:07:04.333
In most of Africa, the cell phone
penetration rate is 80 percent.

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:08.413
We passed the point last October

00:07:08.437 --> 00:07:12.408
when there were more
mobile cellular devices, SIM cards,

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.548
out in the world than there were people.

00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:21.062
We are within years
of a profound moment in our history,

00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:26.443
when effectively every single
human being on the planet

00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:31.075
is going to be part of a man-made
system for the first time,

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:33.140
able to touch anyone else --

00:07:33.164 --> 00:07:35.526
touch them for good, touch them for ill.

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:41.825
And the changes associated with that
are changing the very nature

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:45.450
of every aspect of governance
and life on the planet

00:07:45.474 --> 00:07:48.920
in ways that our leaders
ought to be thinking about,

00:07:48.944 --> 00:07:51.424
when they're thinking about
these immediate threats.

00:07:51.824 --> 00:07:53.590
On the security side,

00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:59.118
we've come out of a Cold War in which
it was too costly to fight a nuclear war,

00:07:59.142 --> 00:08:00.676
and so we didn't,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.517
to a period that I call
Cool War, cyber war,

00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:09.592
where the costs of conflict are actually
so low, that we may never stop.

00:08:10.137 --> 00:08:12.863
We may enter a period of constant warfare,

00:08:12.887 --> 00:08:17.298
and we know this because
we've been in it for several years.

00:08:17.322 --> 00:08:22.873
And yet, we don't have the basic doctrines
to guide us in this regard.

00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:25.346
We don't have the basic ideas formulated.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.910
If someone attacks us with a cyber attack,

00:08:27.934 --> 00:08:31.049
do have the ability to respond
with a kinetic attack?

00:08:31.787 --> 00:08:32.994
We don't know.

00:08:33.573 --> 00:08:37.658
If somebody launches a cyber attack,
how do we deter them?

00:08:37.682 --> 00:08:39.869
When China launched
a series of cyber attacks,

00:08:39.893 --> 00:08:41.420
what did the U.S. government do?

00:08:41.444 --> 00:08:45.429
It said, we're going to indict
a few of these Chinese guys,

00:08:45.453 --> 00:08:47.195
who are never coming to America.

00:08:47.897 --> 00:08:51.846
They're never going to be anywhere near
a law enforcement officer

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.875
who's going to take them into custody.

00:08:54.252 --> 00:08:57.142
It's a gesture -- it's not a deterrent.

00:08:57.678 --> 00:09:01.476
Special forces operators
out there in the field today

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.371
discover that small groups
of insurgents with cell phones

00:09:06.395 --> 00:09:11.666
have access to satellite imagery
that once only superpowers had.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.857
In fact, if you've got a cell phone,

00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:17.197
you've got access to power
that a superpower didn't have,

00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:19.376
and would have highly
classified 10 years ago.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.291
In my cell phone,
I have an app that tells me

00:09:22.315 --> 00:09:26.855
where every plane in the world is,
and its altitude, and its speed,

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:28.701
and what kind of aircraft it is,

00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:31.641
and where it's going
and where it's landing.

00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:36.978
They have apps that allow them to know

00:09:37.002 --> 00:09:39.221
what their adversary is about to do.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.621
They're using these tools in new ways.

00:09:41.645 --> 00:09:45.759
When a cafe in Sydney
was taken over by a terrorist,

00:09:45.783 --> 00:09:48.076
he went in with a rifle...

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.343
and an iPad.

00:09:49.936 --> 00:09:52.497
And the weapon was the iPad.

00:09:52.999 --> 00:09:56.298
Because he captured people,
he terrorized them,

00:09:56.322 --> 00:09:59.027
he pointed the iPad at them,

00:09:59.051 --> 00:10:01.723
and then he took the video
and he put it on the Internet,

00:10:01.747 --> 00:10:03.770
and he took over the world's media.

00:10:05.861 --> 00:10:09.329
But it doesn't just affect
the security side.

00:10:10.132 --> 00:10:11.961
The relations between great powers --

00:10:11.985 --> 00:10:14.350
we thought we were past the bipolar era.

00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:17.133
We thought we were in a unipolar world,

00:10:17.157 --> 00:10:19.051
where all the big issues were resolved.

00:10:19.075 --> 00:10:20.792
Remember? It was the end of history.

00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:23.425
But we're not.

00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:27.837
We're now seeing that our
basic assumptions about the Internet --

00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:31.922
that it was going to connect us,
weave society together --

00:10:31.946 --> 00:10:33.602
are not necessarily true.

00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:37.279
In countries like China,
you have the Great Firewall of China.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.823
You've got countries saying no,
if the Internet happens within our borders

00:10:40.847 --> 00:10:42.422
we control it within our borders.

00:10:42.446 --> 00:10:45.306
We control the content.
We are going to control our security.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.096
We are going to manage that Internet.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.933
We are going to say what can be on it.

00:10:48.957 --> 00:10:51.008
We're going to set
a different set of rules.

00:10:51.032 --> 00:10:53.129
Now you might think,
well, that's just China.

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:54.867
But it's not just China.

00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:58.380
It's China, India, Russia.

00:10:58.708 --> 00:11:01.808
It's Saudi Arabia,
it's Singapore, it's Brazil.

00:11:01.832 --> 00:11:06.346
After the NSA scandal, the Russians,
the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians,

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.425
they said, let's create
a new Internet backbone,

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:11.931
because we can't be dependent
on this other one.

00:11:11.955 --> 00:11:13.924
And so all of a sudden, what do you have?

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.899
You have a new bipolar world

00:11:16.923 --> 00:11:19.114
in which cyber-internationalism,

00:11:19.138 --> 00:11:20.289
our belief,

00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:23.150
is challenged by cyber-nationalism,

00:11:23.174 --> 00:11:24.439
another belief.

00:11:25.593 --> 00:11:28.764
We are seeing these changes
everywhere we look.

00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:31.607
We are seeing the advent of mobile money.

00:11:31.631 --> 00:11:33.928
It's happening in the places
you wouldn't expect.

00:11:33.952 --> 00:11:36.329
It's happening in Kenya and Tanzania,

00:11:36.353 --> 00:11:39.622
where millions of people who haven't
had access to financial services

00:11:39.646 --> 00:11:42.141
now conduct all those
services on their phones.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:47.202
There are 2.5 million people
who don't have financial service access

00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:49.242
that are going to get it soon.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.553
A billion of them are going
to have the ability to access it

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:53.772
on their cell phone soon.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:56.649
It's not just going to give them
the ability to bank.

00:11:56.957 --> 00:11:59.834
It's going to change
what monetary policy is.

00:11:59.858 --> 00:12:02.494
It's going to change what money is.

00:12:03.262 --> 00:12:05.433
Education is changing in the same way.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.891
Healthcare is changing in the same way.

00:12:08.915 --> 00:12:12.409
How government services are delivered
is changing in the same way.

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:17.869
And yet, in Washington, we are debating

00:12:17.893 --> 00:12:23.358
whether to call the terrorist group
that has taken over Syria and Iraq

00:12:23.382 --> 00:12:27.542
ISIS or ISIL or Islamic State.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.651
We are trying to determine

00:12:31.675 --> 00:12:36.964
how much we want to give
in a negotiation with the Iranians

00:12:36.988 --> 00:12:41.787
on a nuclear deal which deals
with the technologies of 50 years ago,

00:12:41.811 --> 00:12:47.169
when in fact, we know that the Iranians
right now are engaged in cyber war with us

00:12:47.193 --> 00:12:53.227
and we're ignoring it, partially
because businesses are not willing

00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:56.369
to talk about the attacks
that are being waged on them.

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:00.208
And that gets us to another breakdown

00:13:00.232 --> 00:13:01.456
that's crucial,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.191
and another breakdown that couldn't be
more important to a group like this,

00:13:05.215 --> 00:13:08.867
because the growth of America
and real American national security

00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:13.332
and all of the things that drove progress
even during the Cold War,

00:13:13.356 --> 00:13:18.107
was a public-private partnership
between science, technology and government

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.639
that began when Thomas Jefferson
sat alone in his laboratory

00:13:21.663 --> 00:13:23.506
inventing new things.

00:13:24.528 --> 00:13:28.338
But it was the canals
and railroads and telegraph;

00:13:28.362 --> 00:13:30.678
it was radar and the Internet.

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:33.413
It was Tang, the breakfast drink --

00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:36.314
probably not the most important
of those developments.

00:13:36.795 --> 00:13:39.674
But what you had was
a partnership and a dialogue,

00:13:39.698 --> 00:13:41.963
and the dialogue has broken down.

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:44.366
It's broken down because in Washington,

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.156
less government is considered more.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.659
It's broken down because there is,
believe it or not,

00:13:48.683 --> 00:13:50.523
in Washington, a war on science --

00:13:50.547 --> 00:13:53.586
despite the fact that
in all of human history,

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.570
every time anyone has waged
a war on science,

00:13:56.594 --> 00:13:58.195
science has won.

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:04.390
(Applause)

00:14:04.712 --> 00:14:08.908
But we have a government
that doesn't want to listen,

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.091
that doesn't have people
at the highest levels

00:14:11.115 --> 00:14:12.269
that understand this.

00:14:12.293 --> 00:14:13.444
In the nuclear age,

00:14:13.468 --> 00:14:16.635
when there were people
in senior national security jobs,

00:14:16.659 --> 00:14:19.687
they were expected to speak throw-weight.

00:14:20.005 --> 00:14:23.023
They were expected to know
the lingo, the vocabulary.

00:14:23.047 --> 00:14:25.846
If you went to the highest level
of the U.S. government now

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.403
and said, "Talk to me about cyber,
about neuroscience,

00:14:28.427 --> 00:14:31.567
about the things that are going
to change the world of tomorrow,"

00:14:31.591 --> 00:14:32.742
you'd get a blank stare.

00:14:32.766 --> 00:14:34.687
I know, because when I wrote this book,

00:14:34.711 --> 00:14:37.751
I talked to 150 people,
many from the science and tech side,

00:14:37.775 --> 00:14:40.831
who felt like they were being
shunted off to the kids' table.

00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:43.471
Meanwhile, on the tech side,

00:14:43.495 --> 00:14:47.300
we have lots of wonderful people
creating wonderful things,

00:14:47.324 --> 00:14:50.281
but they started in garages
and they didn't need the government

00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:51.978
and they don't want the government.

00:14:52.002 --> 00:14:54.769
Many of them have a political view
that's somewhere between

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:56.687
libertarian and anarchic:

00:14:56.711 --> 00:14:58.072
leave me alone.

00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:01.119
But the world's coming apart.

00:15:01.668 --> 00:15:05.057
All of a sudden, there are going to be
massive regulatory changes

00:15:05.081 --> 00:15:07.999
and massive issues
associated with conflict

00:15:08.023 --> 00:15:12.308
and massive issues associated
with security and privacy.

00:15:12.332 --> 00:15:14.827
And we haven't even gotten
to the next set of issues,

00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:16.815
which are philosophical issues.

00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:20.423
If you can't vote,
if you can't have a job,

00:15:20.447 --> 00:15:22.939
if you can't bank,
if you can't get health care,

00:15:22.963 --> 00:15:25.405
if you can't be educated
without Internet access,

00:15:25.429 --> 00:15:30.340
is Internet access a fundamental right
that should be written into constitutions?

00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:33.535
If Internet access is a fundamental right,

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:37.717
is electricity access for the 1.2 billion
who don't have access to electricity

00:15:37.741 --> 00:15:39.158
a fundamental right?

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.529
These are fundamental issues.
Where are the philosophers?

00:15:42.553 --> 00:15:44.213
Where's the dialogue?

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.106
And that brings me
to the reason that I'm here.

00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:51.077
I live in Washington. Pity me.

00:15:51.101 --> 00:15:52.871
(Laughter)

00:15:52.895 --> 00:15:55.162
The dialogue isn't happening there.

00:15:55.932 --> 00:15:58.327
These big issues
that will change the world,

00:15:58.351 --> 00:16:00.999
change national security,
change economics,

00:16:01.023 --> 00:16:03.906
create hope, create threats,

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.644
can only be resolved
when you bring together

00:16:06.668 --> 00:16:10.049
groups of people who understand
science and technology

00:16:10.073 --> 00:16:11.746
back together with government.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.950
Both sides need each other.

00:16:14.486 --> 00:16:19.238
And until we recreate that connection,

00:16:19.262 --> 00:16:24.693
until we do what helped America grow
and helped other countries grow,

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:27.787
then we are going to grow
ever more vulnerable.

00:16:28.547 --> 00:16:32.358
The risks associated with 9/11
will not be measured

00:16:32.382 --> 00:16:35.388
in terms of lives lost by terror attacks

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:39.497
or buildings destroyed
or trillions of dollars spent.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.943
They'll be measured in terms of the costs
of our distraction from critical issues

00:16:44.967 --> 00:16:48.700
and our inability to get together

00:16:48.724 --> 00:16:52.920
scientists, technologists,
government leaders,

00:16:52.944 --> 00:16:58.079
at a moment of transformation
akin to the beginning of the Renaissance,

00:16:58.103 --> 00:17:01.821
akin to the beginning
of the major transformational eras

00:17:01.845 --> 00:17:04.334
that have happened on Earth,

00:17:04.358 --> 00:17:08.804
and start coming up with,
if not the right answers,

00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:11.181
then at least the right questions.

00:17:11.205 --> 00:17:13.248
We are not there yet,

00:17:13.272 --> 00:17:16.336
but discussions like this
and groups like you

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.146
are the places where those questions
can be formulated and posed.

00:17:20.553 --> 00:17:25.107
And that's why I believe
that groups like TED,

00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:27.724
discussions like this around the planet,

00:17:27.748 --> 00:17:32.458
are the place where the future
of foreign policy, of economic policy,

00:17:32.482 --> 00:17:37.969
of social policy, of philosophy,
will ultimately take place.

00:17:38.394 --> 00:17:40.824
And that's why it's been
a pleasure speaking to you.

00:17:40.848 --> 00:17:42.103
Thank you very, very much.

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:46.993
(Applause)
