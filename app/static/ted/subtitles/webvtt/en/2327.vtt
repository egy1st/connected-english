00:00:01.638 --> 00:00:03.982
Billie Jean King: Hi, everyone!

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.348
(Applause)

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:07.550
Thanks, Pat.

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.132
Thank you!

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.516
Getting me all wound up, now!

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.546
(Laughter)

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.757
Pat Mitchell: Good!

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:20.538
You know, when I was watching
the video again of the match,

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:25.051
you must have felt
like the fate of the world's women

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:27.673
was on every stroke you took.

00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:29.963
Were you feeling that?

00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:34.154
BJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs --
he was the former number one player,

00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:36.180
he wasn't just some hacker, by the way.

00:00:36.204 --> 00:00:39.086
He was one of my heroes and I admired him.

00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:43.336
And that's the reason I beat him,
actually, because I respected him.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.459
(Laughter)

00:00:44.483 --> 00:00:47.079
It's true -- my mom
and especially my dad always said:

00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:49.981
"Respect your opponent,
and never underestimate them, ever."

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.293
And he was correct.
He was absolutely correct.

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:55.282
But I knew it was about social change.

00:00:56.962 --> 00:01:00.324
And I was really nervous
whenever we announced it,

00:01:00.348 --> 00:01:03.217
and I felt like the whole world
was on my shoulders.

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:08.902
And I thought, "If I lose, it's going
to put women back 50 years, at least."

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:12.823
Title IX had just been passed
the year before -- June 23, 1972.

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:16.466
And women's professional tennis --

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.763
there were nine of us who signed
a one-dollar contract in 1970 --

00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:21.886
now remember, the match is in '73.

00:01:22.454 --> 00:01:25.614
So we were only in our
third year of having a tour

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:29.898
where we could actually play,
have a place to compete and make a living.

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:32.918
So there were nine of us that signed
that one-dollar contract.

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:37.911
And our dream was for any girl,
born any place in the world --

00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:39.493
if she was good enough --

00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:43.628
there would be a place for her to compete
and for us to make a living.

00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:47.412
Because before 1968,
we made 14 dollars a day,

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:49.888
and we were under the control
of organizations.

00:01:49.912 --> 00:01:52.105
So we really wanted
to break away from that.

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:54.845
But we knew it wasn't really
about our generation so much;

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.919
we knew it was about
the future generations.

00:01:56.943 --> 00:02:00.948
We do stand on the shoulders of the people
that came before us, there is no question.

00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:03.505
But every generation
has the chance to make it better.

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:06.682
That was really on my mind.

00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:10.325
I really wanted to start matching
the hearts and minds to Title IX.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.136
Title IX, in case anybody doesn't know,
which a lot of people probably don't,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.438
said that any federal funds given
to a high school, college or university,

00:02:18.462 --> 00:02:20.536
either public or private,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.462
had to -- finally --
give equal monies to boys and girls.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.400
And that changed everything.

00:02:27.424 --> 00:02:30.250
(Applause)

00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:32.032
So you can have a law,

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:34.971
but it's changing the hearts and minds
to match up with it.

00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:37.542
That's when it really rocks, totally.

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:38.717
So that was on my mind.

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:42.330
I wanted to start that change
in the hearts and minds.

00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:45.146
But two things came out of that match.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.326
For women: self-confidence, empowerment.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.892
They actually had enough nerve
to ask for a raise.

00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:55.516
Some women have waited
10, 15 years to ask.

00:02:55.838 --> 00:02:57.839
I said, "More importantly,
did you get it?"

00:02:57.863 --> 00:02:58.931
(Laughter)

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:00.129
And they did!

00:03:00.153 --> 00:03:01.947
And for the men?

00:03:01.971 --> 00:03:04.802
A lot of the men today don't realize it,

00:03:04.826 --> 00:03:10.231
but if you're in your 50s, 60s
or whatever, late 40s,

00:03:10.255 --> 00:03:13.831
you're the first generation of men
of the Women's Movement --

00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:15.147
whether you like it or not!

00:03:15.171 --> 00:03:18.193
(Laughter)

00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:19.500
(Applause)

00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:20.675
And for the men,

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.314
what happened for the men,
they'd come up to me --

00:03:23.338 --> 00:03:26.439
and most times, the men are the ones
who have tears in their eyes,

00:03:26.463 --> 00:03:27.614
it's very interesting.

00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:31.651
They go, "Billie, I was very young
when I saw that match,

00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:33.029
and now I have a daughter.

00:03:35.193 --> 00:03:37.990
And I am so happy I saw that
as a young man."

00:03:38.588 --> 00:03:42.137
And one of those young men,
at 12 years old, was President Obama.

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:45.654
And he actually told me that
when I met him, he said:

00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:48.636
"You don't realize it,
but I saw that match at 12.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.513
And now I have two daughters,

00:03:50.537 --> 00:03:52.963
and it has made a difference
in how I raise them."

00:03:52.987 --> 00:03:57.704
So both men and women got a lot
out of it, but different things.

00:03:58.276 --> 00:04:01.431
PM: And now there are generations --
at least one or two --

00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:04.155
who have experienced the equality

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:09.065
that Title IX and other fights
along the way made possible.

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:13.680
And for women, there are generations
who have also experienced teamwork.

00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:17.754
They got to play team sports
in a way they hadn't before.

00:04:18.146 --> 00:04:23.227
So you had a legacy already built
in terms of being an athlete,

00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:28.506
a legacy of the work you did
to lobby for equal pay for women athletes

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.804
and the Women's Sports Foundation.

00:04:31.368 --> 00:04:34.070
What now are you looking to accomplish

00:04:34.094 --> 00:04:37.050
with The Billie Jean King
Leadership Initiative?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.208
BJK: I think it goes back
to an epiphany I had at 12.

00:04:40.232 --> 00:04:43.233
At 11, I wanted to be the number one
tennis player in the world,

00:04:43.257 --> 00:04:46.568
and a friend had asked me to play
and I said, "What's that?"

00:04:47.098 --> 00:04:50.573
Tennis was not in my family --
basketball was, other sports.

00:04:50.597 --> 00:04:52.465
Fast forward to 12 years old,

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:54.086
(Laughter)

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.324
and I'm finally starting
to play in tournaments

00:04:56.348 --> 00:04:58.799
where you get a ranking
at the end of the year.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:02.801
So I was daydreaming
at the Los Angeles Tennis Club,

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:07.589
and I started thinking about my sport
and how tiny it was,

00:05:07.613 --> 00:05:11.262
but also that everybody who played
wore white shoes, white clothes,

00:05:11.286 --> 00:05:14.180
played with white balls --
everybody who played was white.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.842
And I said to myself, at 12 years old,
"Where is everyone else?"

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:25.373
And that just kept sticking in my brain.

00:05:25.397 --> 00:05:26.548
And that moment,

00:05:26.572 --> 00:05:29.526
I promised myself I'd fight
for equal rights and opportunities

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.298
for boys and girls, men and women,
the rest of my life.

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:36.991
And that tennis, if I was fortunate
enough to become number one --

00:05:37.015 --> 00:05:40.506
and I knew, being a girl,
it would be harder to have influence,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.507
already at that age --

00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:44.577
that I had this platform.

00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:47.969
And tennis is global.

00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:51.192
And I thought, "You know what?

00:05:52.163 --> 00:05:55.091
I've been given an opportunity
that very few people have had."

00:05:55.115 --> 00:05:58.070
I didn't know if I was going
to make it -- this was only 12.

00:05:58.094 --> 00:06:01.222
I sure wanted it, but making it
is a whole other discussion.

00:06:01.246 --> 00:06:05.449
I just remember I promised myself,
and I really try to keep my word.

00:06:06.174 --> 00:06:09.976
That's who I truly am,
just fighting for people.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.210
And, unfortunately, women have had less.

00:06:15.031 --> 00:06:17.300
And we are considered less.

00:06:17.324 --> 00:06:19.592
And so my attentions,
where did they have to go?

00:06:19.616 --> 00:06:21.801
It was just ... you have to.

00:06:21.825 --> 00:06:25.056
And learn to stick up for yourself,
hear your own voice.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.417
You hear the same words
keep coming out all the time,

00:06:28.441 --> 00:06:32.158
and I got really lucky
because I had an education.

00:06:32.182 --> 00:06:34.750
And I think if you can see it
you can be it, you know?

00:06:34.774 --> 00:06:36.990
If you can see it, you can be it.

00:06:37.014 --> 00:06:39.018
You look at Pat,
you look at other leaders,

00:06:39.042 --> 00:06:41.188
you look at these speakers,
look at yourself,

00:06:41.212 --> 00:06:42.870
because everyone --

00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:44.252
everyone --

00:06:44.276 --> 00:06:46.089
can do something extraordinary.

00:06:46.113 --> 00:06:47.555
Every single person.

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:51.812
PM: And your story, Billie,
has inspired so many women everywhere.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:55.158
Now with the Billie Jean King
Leadership Initiative,

00:06:55.182 --> 00:06:57.366
you're taking on an even bigger cause.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.414
Because one thing we hear a lot
about is women taking their voice,

00:07:01.438 --> 00:07:04.865
working to find their way
into leadership positions.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:07.721
But what you're talking
about is even bigger than that.

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:09.974
It's inclusive leadership.

00:07:09.998 --> 00:07:13.588
And this is a generation that has grown up
thinking more inclusively --

00:07:13.612 --> 00:07:15.733
BJK: Isn't it great?
Look at the technology!

00:07:15.757 --> 00:07:20.309
It's amazing how it connects us all!
It's about connection.

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:23.947
It's simply amazing
what's possible because of it.

00:07:23.971 --> 00:07:26.411
But the Billie Jean King
Leadership Initiative

00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:29.499
is really about the workforce mostly,
and trying to change it,

00:07:29.523 --> 00:07:33.868
so people can actually go to work
and be their authentic selves.

00:07:33.892 --> 00:07:36.929
Because most of us have two jobs:

00:07:36.953 --> 00:07:39.572
One, to fit in -- I'll give you
a perfect example.

00:07:39.596 --> 00:07:42.927
An African American woman
gets up an hour earlier to go to work,

00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:44.752
straightens her hair in the bathroom,

00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:47.959
goes to the bathroom
probably four, five, six times a day

00:07:47.983 --> 00:07:51.071
to keep straightening her hair,
to keep making sure she fits in.

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:52.365
So she's working two jobs.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.774
She's got this other job,
whatever that may be,

00:07:54.798 --> 00:07:57.008
but she's also trying to fit in.

00:07:57.032 --> 00:08:01.075
Or this poor man who kept his diploma --

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:02.815
he went to University of Michigan,

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:06.160
but he never would talk about
his poverty as a youngster, ever --

00:08:06.184 --> 00:08:07.503
just would not mention it.

00:08:07.527 --> 00:08:09.776
So he made sure they saw
he was well-educated.

00:08:10.338 --> 00:08:12.782
And then you see a gay guy
who has an NFL --

00:08:12.806 --> 00:08:15.447
which means American football
for all of you out there,

00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:17.422
it's a big deal, it's very macho --

00:08:17.447 --> 00:08:19.469
and he talked about football all the time,

00:08:19.493 --> 00:08:23.073
because he was gay
and he didn't want anybody to know.

00:08:23.097 --> 00:08:24.874
It just goes on and on.

00:08:24.898 --> 00:08:31.011
So my wish for everyone is to be able
to be their authentic self 24/7,

00:08:31.035 --> 00:08:32.841
that would be the ultimate.

00:08:32.865 --> 00:08:36.391
And we catch ourselves -- I mean,
I catch myself to this day.

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.562
Even being gay I catch myself,
you know, like,

00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:39.736
(Gasp)

00:08:40.464 --> 00:08:43.552
a little uncomfortable,
a little surge in my gut,

00:08:43.576 --> 00:08:46.644
feeling not totally
comfortable in my own skin.

00:08:48.655 --> 00:08:50.884
So, I think you have to ask yourself --

00:08:50.908 --> 00:08:54.055
I want people to be themselves,
whatever that is, just let it be.

00:08:54.079 --> 00:08:57.791
PM: And the first research
the Leadership Initiative did showed that,

00:08:57.815 --> 00:09:01.051
that these examples you just used --

00:09:01.075 --> 00:09:05.880
that many of us have the problem
of being authentic.

00:09:05.904 --> 00:09:09.929
But what you've just looked at
is this millennial generation,

00:09:09.953 --> 00:09:13.491
who have benefited from all these
equal opportunities --

00:09:13.515 --> 00:09:15.676
which may not be equal
but exist everywhere --

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.419
BJK: First of all, I'm really lucky.

00:09:17.443 --> 00:09:21.975
Partnership with Teneo,
a strategic company that's amazing.

00:09:21.999 --> 00:09:24.172
That's really the reason
I'm able to do this.

00:09:24.517 --> 00:09:25.978
I've had two times in my life

00:09:26.002 --> 00:09:28.688
where I've actually had men
really behind me with power.

00:09:28.712 --> 00:09:32.002
And that was in the old days
with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims,

00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:34.360
and this is the second time
in my entire life.

00:09:34.384 --> 00:09:35.733
And then Deloitte.

00:09:37.157 --> 00:09:39.942
The one thing I wanted was data -- facts.

00:09:40.465 --> 00:09:42.192
So Deloitte sent out a survey,

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:46.221
and over 4,000 people now have answered,

00:09:46.245 --> 00:09:48.129
and we're continuing in the workplace.

00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:51.300
And what do the millennials feel?

00:09:52.157 --> 00:09:55.418
Well, they feel a lot, but what
they're so fantastic about is --

00:09:55.442 --> 00:09:58.971
you know, our generation was like,
"Oh, we're going to get representation."

00:09:58.995 --> 00:10:01.783
So if you walk into a room,
you see everybody represented.

00:10:01.807 --> 00:10:04.277
That's not good enough anymore,
which is so good!

00:10:04.301 --> 00:10:08.521
So the millennials are fantastic;
they want connection, engagement.

00:10:08.545 --> 00:10:11.969
They just want you to tell us
what you're feeling, what you're thinking,

00:10:11.993 --> 00:10:13.246
and get into the solution.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.508
They're problem-solvers,

00:10:14.532 --> 00:10:17.407
and of course, you've got
the information at your fingertips,

00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:20.133
compared to when I was growing up.

00:10:20.157 --> 00:10:22.685
PM: What did the research show you
about millennials?

00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:24.428
Are they going to make a difference?

00:10:24.452 --> 00:10:28.469
Are they going to create a world where
there is really an inclusive work force?

00:10:28.493 --> 00:10:34.385
BJK: Well, in 2025,
75 percent of the global workforce

00:10:34.409 --> 00:10:35.849
is going to be millennials.

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:38.489
I think they are going
to help solve problems.

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:40.609
I think they have
the wherewithal to do it.

00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:42.204
I know they care a lot.

00:10:42.228 --> 00:10:46.704
They have big ideas
and they can make big things happen.

00:10:47.049 --> 00:10:49.367
I want to stay in the now
with the young people,

00:10:49.391 --> 00:10:51.285
I don't want to get behind.

00:10:52.673 --> 00:10:54.344
(Laughter)

00:10:54.368 --> 00:10:56.174
PM: I don't think there's any chance!

00:10:57.604 --> 00:11:00.599
But what you found out
in the research about millennials

00:11:00.623 --> 00:11:05.250
is not really the experience that a lot
of people have with millennials.

00:11:05.274 --> 00:11:09.038
BJK: No, well, if we want to talk --
OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey.

00:11:09.062 --> 00:11:13.945
I've been talking to the Boomers,
who are their bosses, and I go,

00:11:13.969 --> 00:11:16.015
"What do you think about the millennials?"

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.915
And I'm pretty excited, like it's good,

00:11:17.939 --> 00:11:19.395
and they get this face --

00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:21.735
(Laughter)

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:23.441
"Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?"

00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:25.046
(Laughter)

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.558
I say, "Do you really think so?

00:11:26.582 --> 00:11:29.464
Because I do think they care
about the environment

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.783
and all these things."

00:11:31.442 --> 00:11:35.927
And they go, "Oh, Billie,
they cannot focus."

00:11:35.951 --> 00:11:38.653
(Laughter)

00:11:38.677 --> 00:11:40.296
They actually have proven

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.814
that the average focus
for an 18-year-old is 37 seconds.

00:11:43.838 --> 00:11:45.407
(Laughter)

00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:46.830
They can't focus.

00:11:46.854 --> 00:11:48.263
And they don't really care.

00:11:48.287 --> 00:11:50.128
I just heard a story the other night:

00:11:50.152 --> 00:11:52.582
a woman owns a gallery
and she has these workers.

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:56.712
She gets a text from one of the workers,

00:11:56.736 --> 00:11:59.384
like an intern, she's
just starting -- she goes,

00:11:59.408 --> 00:12:02.791
"Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late
because I'm at the hairdresser's."

00:12:02.815 --> 00:12:07.727
(Laughter)

00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:11.563
So she arrives, and this boss says,

00:12:11.587 --> 00:12:12.738
"What's going on?"

00:12:12.762 --> 00:12:15.288
And she says, "Oh, I was late,
sorry, how's it going?"

00:12:15.312 --> 00:12:19.412
She says, "Well, guess what?
I'd like you leave, you're finished."

00:12:19.436 --> 00:12:20.802
She goes, "OK."

00:12:20.826 --> 00:12:24.028
(Laughter)

00:12:24.052 --> 00:12:25.203
No problem!

00:12:25.227 --> 00:12:26.649
PM: Now Billie, that story --

00:12:26.673 --> 00:12:29.107
I know, but that's what
scares the boomers --

00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:31.994
I'm just telling you --
so I think it's good for us to share.

00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:33.587
(Laughter)

00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:35.094
No, it is good for us to share,

00:12:35.118 --> 00:12:38.187
because we're our authentic selves
and what we're really feeling,

00:12:38.211 --> 00:12:40.484
so we've got to take it
both ways, you know?

00:12:40.508 --> 00:12:42.455
But I have great faith because --

00:12:42.479 --> 00:12:45.372
if you've been in sports like I have --

00:12:45.396 --> 00:12:47.029
every generation gets better.

00:12:47.053 --> 00:12:48.338
It's a fact.

00:12:48.362 --> 00:12:52.371
With the Women's Sports Foundation
being the advocates for Title IX still,

00:12:52.395 --> 00:12:54.648
because we're trying
to keep protecting the law,

00:12:54.672 --> 00:12:57.817
because it's in a tenuous position always,

00:12:57.841 --> 00:12:59.721
so we really are concerned,

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:01.436
and we do a lot of research.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.134
That's very important to us.

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:04.753
And I want to hear from people.

00:13:05.407 --> 00:13:10.856
But we really have to protect
what Title IX stands for worldwide.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.646
And you heard President Carter
talk about how Title IX is protected.

00:13:16.598 --> 00:13:20.192
And do you know that every single lawsuit

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:23.734
that girls, at least in sports,
have gone up against --

00:13:23.758 --> 00:13:26.167
whatever institutions --

00:13:26.191 --> 00:13:27.592
has won?

00:13:27.616 --> 00:13:29.747
Title IX is there to protect us.

00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:31.788
And it is amazing.

00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:35.788
But we still have to get
the hearts and minds --

00:13:35.812 --> 00:13:38.549
the hearts and minds
to match the legislation is huge.

00:13:38.573 --> 00:13:40.656
PM: So what gets you up every morning?

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.112
What keeps you sustaining your work,

00:13:43.136 --> 00:13:46.334
sustaining the fight
for equality, extending it,

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:49.789
always exploring new areas,
trying to find new ways ... ?

00:13:49.813 --> 00:13:53.583
BJK: Well, I always drove my parents crazy
because I was always the curious one.

00:13:54.678 --> 00:13:56.422
I'm highly motivated.

00:13:56.446 --> 00:14:00.225
My younger brother was
a Major League Baseball player.

00:14:00.745 --> 00:14:03.296
My poor parents did not care
if we were any good.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.562
(Laughter)

00:14:04.586 --> 00:14:07.325
And we drove them crazy because we pushed,

00:14:07.349 --> 00:14:09.351
we pushed because
we wanted to be the best.

00:14:12.587 --> 00:14:17.413
And I think it's because of what
I'm hearing today in TED talks.

00:14:17.858 --> 00:14:21.514
I think to listen to these
different women,

00:14:21.538 --> 00:14:23.018
to listen to different people,

00:14:23.042 --> 00:14:26.288
to listen to President Carter --
90 years old, by the way,

00:14:26.312 --> 00:14:29.784
and he we was throwing these figures
out that I would never --

00:14:29.808 --> 00:14:30.962
I'd have to go,

00:14:30.986 --> 00:14:34.277
"Excuse me, wait a minute, I need
to get a list out of these figures."

00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:36.978
He was rattling off --
I mean, that's amazing, I'm sorry.

00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:39.329
PM: He's an amazing man.

00:14:39.353 --> 00:14:42.061
(Applause)

00:14:42.085 --> 00:14:45.477
BJK: And then you're going to have
President Mary Robinson,

00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:47.386
who's a former president --

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:52.292
Thank you, Irish! 62 percent! LGBTQ! Yes!

00:14:52.316 --> 00:14:53.470
(Applause)

00:14:53.494 --> 00:14:56.911
Congress is voting in June
on same-sex marriage,

00:14:56.935 --> 00:15:00.871
so these are things that for some people
are very hard to hear.

00:15:00.895 --> 00:15:03.676
But always remember,
every one of us is an individual,

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.372
a human being with a beating heart,

00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:09.524
who cares and wants to live
their authentic life.

00:15:10.258 --> 00:15:12.374
OK? You don't have to agree with somebody,

00:15:12.398 --> 00:15:14.111
but everyone has the opportunity.

00:15:15.824 --> 00:15:18.999
I think we all have an obligation

00:15:19.023 --> 00:15:23.887
to continue to keep moving
the needle forward, always.

00:15:23.911 --> 00:15:25.909
And these people have been so inspiring.

00:15:26.705 --> 00:15:27.863
Everyone matters.

00:15:27.887 --> 00:15:29.764
And every one of you is an influencer.

00:15:29.788 --> 00:15:33.198
You out there listening, out there
in the world, plus the people here --

00:15:33.222 --> 00:15:35.037
every single person's an influencer.

00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:37.579
Never, ever forget that. OK?

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:39.923
So don't ever give up on yourself.

00:15:40.622 --> 00:15:42.900
PM: Billie, you have been
an inspiration for us.

00:15:42.924 --> 00:15:44.074
BJK: Thanks, Pat!

00:15:44.098 --> 00:15:47.913
(Applause)

00:15:47.937 --> 00:15:49.088
Thanks, TED!

00:15:49.112 --> 00:15:51.104
(Applause)

00:15:51.128 --> 00:15:52.278
Thanks a lot!
