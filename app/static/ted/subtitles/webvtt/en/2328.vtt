WEBVTT

00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:03.023
For the last 50 years,

00:00:03.047 --> 00:00:08.638
a lot of smart, well-resourced people --
some of you, no doubt --

00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:11.964
have been trying to figure out
how to reduce poverty

00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:13.207
in the United States.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.144
People have created and invested
millions of dollars

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:20.385
into non-profit organizations

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.599
with the mission of helping
people who are poor.

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.135
They've created think tanks

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.413
that study issues like education,
job creation and asset-building,

00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:36.212
and then advocated for policies to support
our most marginalized communities.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:40.370
They've written books and columns
and given passionate speeches,

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:44.165
decrying the wealth gap
that is leaving more and more people

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.289
entrenched at the bottom end
of the income scale.

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:49.645
And that effort has helped.

00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:51.573
But it's not enough.

00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:55.834
Our poverty rates haven't changed
that much in the last 50 years,

00:00:55.858 --> 00:00:57.961
since the War on Poverty was launched.

00:00:58.576 --> 00:01:00.727
I'm here to tell you

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:06.178
that we have overlooked
the most powerful and practical resource.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.485
Here it is:

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.202
people who are poor.

00:01:11.382 --> 00:01:15.394
Up in the left-hand corner
is Jobana, Sintia and Bertha.

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:17.934
They met when they all had small children,

00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.795
through a parenting class
at a family resource center

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:22.003
in San Francisco.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.419
As they grew together
as parents and friends,

00:01:26.443 --> 00:01:28.459
they talked a lot about how hard it was

00:01:28.483 --> 00:01:30.705
to make money when your kids are little.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.411
Child care is expensive,

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:34.190
more than they'd earn in a job.

00:01:34.214 --> 00:01:35.374
Their husbands worked,

00:01:35.398 --> 00:01:37.874
but they wanted to contribute
financially, too.

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:39.637
So they hatched a plan.

00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:41.546
They started a cleaning business.

00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:44.435
They plastered neighborhoods with flyers

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.332
and handed business cards out
to their families and friends,

00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:49.240
and soon, they had clients calling.

00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:52.662
Two of them would clean
the office or house

00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:54.552
and one of them would watch the kids.

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:57.491
They'd rotate who'd cleaned
and who'd watch the kids.

00:01:57.515 --> 00:01:59.728
(Laughs) It's awesome, right?

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:00.966
(Laughter)

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.842
And they split the money three ways.

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:04.167
It was not a full-time gig,

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.422
no one could watch
the little ones all day.

00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:08.960
But it made a difference
for their families.

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.076
Extra money to pay for bills
when a husband's work hours were cut.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.378
Money to buy the kids clothes
as they were growing.

00:02:18.402 --> 00:02:20.321
A little extra money in their pockets

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:22.839
to make them feel some independence.

00:02:22.863 --> 00:02:26.992
Up in the top-right corner
is Theresa and her daughter, Brianna.

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:28.931
Brianna is one of those kids

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:33.765
with this sparkly, infectious,
outgoing personality.

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:35.501
For example, when Rosie,

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:38.681
a little girl who spoke only Spanish,
moved in next door,

00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:40.853
Brianna, who spoke only English,

00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:44.462
borrowed her mother's tablet
and found a translation app

00:02:44.486 --> 00:02:46.266
so the two of them could communicate.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.392
(Laughter)

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:48.598
I know, right?

00:02:48.622 --> 00:02:52.525
Rosie's family credits Brianna
with helping Rosie to learn English.

00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:55.077
A few years ago,

00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:57.888
Brianna started to struggle academically.

00:02:58.312 --> 00:03:02.727
She was growing frustrated
and kind of withdrawn

00:03:02.751 --> 00:03:04.999
and acting out in class.

00:03:05.023 --> 00:03:08.853
And her mother was heartbroken
over what was happening.

00:03:09.697 --> 00:03:12.959
Then they found out that she was going
to have to repeat second grade

00:03:12.983 --> 00:03:14.996
and Brianna was devastated.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.191
Her mother felt hopeless
and overwhelmed and alone

00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:23.719
because she knew that her daughter
was not getting the support she needed,

00:03:23.743 --> 00:03:25.681
and she did not know how to help her.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:29.269
One afternoon, Theresa was catching up
with a group of friends,

00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:30.852
and one of them said,

00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:32.812
"Theresa, how are you?"

00:03:33.344 --> 00:03:35.058
And she burst into tears.

00:03:35.804 --> 00:03:39.145
After she shared her story,
one of her friends said,

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.446
"I went through the exact same thing
with my son about a year ago."

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.621
And in that moment,

00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:45.902
Theresa realized
that so much of her struggle

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:48.428
was not having anybody
to talk with about it.

00:03:48.984 --> 00:03:52.331
So she created a support group
for parents like her.

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:56.435
The first meeting was her
and two other people.

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.500
But word spread, and soon
20 people, 30 people

00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:02.899
were showing up for these
monthly meetings that she put together.

00:04:02.923 --> 00:04:05.140
She went from feeling helpless

00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:08.793
to realizing how capable she was
of supporting her daughter,

00:04:08.817 --> 00:04:12.498
with the support of other people
who were going through the same struggle.

00:04:12.522 --> 00:04:15.559
And Brianna is doing fantastic --
she's doing great academically

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:16.760
and socially.

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:21.220
That in the middle is my man Baakir,

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:24.089
standing in front of
BlackStar Books and Caffe,

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:26.698
which he runs out of part of his house.

00:04:26.722 --> 00:04:28.297
As you walk in the door,

00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:31.705
Baakir greets you
with a "Welcome black home."

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.507
(Laughter)

00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:38.574
Once inside, you can order
some Algiers jerk chicken,

00:04:38.598 --> 00:04:41.121
perhaps a vegan walnut burger,

00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:43.495
or jive turkey sammich.

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:46.412
And that's sammich -- not sandwich.

00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:50.667
You must finish your meal
with a buttermilk drop,

00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:53.049
which is several steps above a donut hole

00:04:53.073 --> 00:04:55.760
and made from a very secret family recipe.

00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:59.014
For real, it's very secret,
he won't tell you about it.

00:04:59.464 --> 00:05:02.697
But BlackStar is much more than a cafÃ©.

00:05:03.046 --> 00:05:04.651
For the kids in the neighborhood,

00:05:04.675 --> 00:05:07.680
it's a place to go after school
to get help with homework.

00:05:07.704 --> 00:05:09.497
For the grown-ups, it's where they go

00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:11.724
to find out what's going on
in the neighborhood

00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:13.105
and catch up with friends.

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:14.606
It's a performance venue.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.960
It's a home for poets,
musicians and artists.

00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:20.608
Baakir and his partner Nicole,

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:22.772
with their baby girl strapped to her back,

00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:24.350
are there in the mix of it all,

00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:26.445
serving up a cup of coffee,

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.609
teaching a child how to play Mancala,

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:31.688
or painting a sign
for an upcoming community event.

00:05:32.182 --> 00:05:36.428
I have worked with and learned
from people just like them

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:38.093
for more than 20 years.

00:05:38.117 --> 00:05:40.960
I have organized
against the prison system,

00:05:40.984 --> 00:05:43.317
which impacts poor folks,

00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:45.885
especially black, indigenous
and Latino folks,

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:47.337
at an alarming rate.

00:05:47.758 --> 00:05:51.273
I have worked with young people
who manifest hope and promise,

00:05:51.297 --> 00:05:55.706
despite being at the effect of racist
discipline practices in their schools,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.166
and police violence in their communities.

00:05:58.605 --> 00:06:00.491
I have learned from families

00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:04.197
who are unleashing
their ingenuity and tenacity

00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.411
to collectively create
their own solutions.

00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:08.539
And they're not just focused on money.

00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:12.607
They're addressing education,
housing, health, community --

00:06:12.631 --> 00:06:14.829
the things that we all care about.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.643
Everywhere I go,

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.801
I see people who are broke but not broken.

00:06:21.263 --> 00:06:25.082
I see people who are struggling
to realize their good ideas,

00:06:25.106 --> 00:06:27.674
so that they can create
a better life for themselves,

00:06:27.698 --> 00:06:30.236
their families, their communities.

00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:37.804
Jobana, Sintia, Bertha, Theresa
and Baakir are the rule,

00:06:37.828 --> 00:06:39.444
not the shiny exception.

00:06:39.923 --> 00:06:41.253
I am the exception.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.109
I was raised by a quietly fierce
single mother in Rochester, New York.

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:50.567
I was bussed to a school
in the suburbs, from a neighborhood

00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:54.478
that many of my classmates
and their parents considered dangerous.

00:06:54.502 --> 00:06:56.497
At eight, I was a latchkey kid.

00:06:56.933 --> 00:07:01.341
I'd get myself home after school every day
and do homework and chores,

00:07:01.365 --> 00:07:03.351
and wait for my mother to come home.

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:05.567
After school, I'd go to the corner store

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.093
and buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli,

00:07:08.117 --> 00:07:10.740
which I'd heat up on the stove
as my afternoon snack.

00:07:11.145 --> 00:07:13.952
If I had a little extra money,
I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie.

00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:14.977
(Laughter)

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:16.152
Cherry.

00:07:16.176 --> 00:07:17.830
Not as good as a buttermilk drop.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:18.855
(Laughter)

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:20.573
We were poor when I was a kid.

00:07:20.597 --> 00:07:24.390
But now, I own a home
in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood

00:07:24.414 --> 00:07:25.943
in Oakland, California.

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.010
I've built a career.

00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:30.820
My husband is a business owner.

00:07:31.605 --> 00:07:33.369
I have a retirement account.

00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:36.882
My daughter is not even allowed
to turn on the stove

00:07:36.906 --> 00:07:38.485
unless there's a grown-up at home

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:39.667
and she doesn't have to,

00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:42.954
because she does not have to have
the same kind of self-reliance

00:07:42.978 --> 00:07:44.771
that I had to at her age.

00:07:44.795 --> 00:07:46.999
My kids' raviolis are organic

00:07:47.023 --> 00:07:49.930
and full of things
like spinach and ricotta,

00:07:49.954 --> 00:07:52.277
because I have the luxury of choice

00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:54.219
when it comes to what my children eat.

00:07:54.243 --> 00:07:56.343
I am the exception,

00:07:56.367 --> 00:07:58.699
not because I'm more talented than Baakir

00:07:58.723 --> 00:08:02.605
or my mother worked any harder
than Jobana, Sintia or Bertha,

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:04.586
or cared any more than Theresa.

00:08:05.395 --> 00:08:10.501
Marginalized communities are full
of smart, talented people,

00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:12.839
hustling and working and innovating,

00:08:12.863 --> 00:08:16.804
just like our most revered
and most rewarded CEOs.

00:08:16.828 --> 00:08:19.461
They are full of people
tapping into their resilience

00:08:19.485 --> 00:08:21.987
to get up every day,
get the kids off to school

00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:23.997
and go to jobs that don't pay enough,

00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:26.489
or get educations
that are putting them in debt.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.654
They are full of people applying
their savvy intelligence

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:34.065
to stretch a minimum wage paycheck,

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:37.276
or balance a job and a side hustle
to make ends meet.

00:08:37.627 --> 00:08:41.402
They are full of people
doing for themselves and for others,

00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:44.930
whether it's picking up medication
for an elderly neighbor,

00:08:44.954 --> 00:08:48.688
or letting a sibling borrow some money
to pay the phone bill,

00:08:48.712 --> 00:08:50.955
or just watching out
for the neighborhood kids

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:52.187
from the front stoop.

00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:56.646
I am the exception
because of luck and privilege,

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.955
not hard work.

00:08:57.979 --> 00:09:00.317
And I'm not being modest
or self-deprecating --

00:09:00.341 --> 00:09:01.492
I am amazing.

00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:02.734
(Laughter)

00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:04.372
But most people work hard.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.999
Hard work is the common
denominator in this equation,

00:09:09.023 --> 00:09:11.392
and I'm tired of the story we tell

00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:14.024
that hard work leads to success,

00:09:14.048 --> 00:09:15.585
because that allows --

00:09:15.609 --> 00:09:16.799
Thank you.

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:20.314
(Applause)

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:26.122
... because that story allows those of us
who make it to believe we deserve it,

00:09:26.146 --> 00:09:27.379
and by implication,

00:09:27.403 --> 00:09:29.636
those who don't make it don't deserve it.

00:09:30.175 --> 00:09:32.378
We tell ourselves,
in the back of our minds,

00:09:32.402 --> 00:09:34.677
and sometimes in the front of our mouths,

00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:37.738
"There must be something a little wrong
with those poor people."

00:09:37.762 --> 00:09:39.254
We have a wide range of beliefs

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:41.463
about what that something wrong is.

00:09:41.487 --> 00:09:44.771
Some people tell the story
that poor folks are lazy freeloaders

00:09:44.795 --> 00:09:47.977
who would cheat and lie
to get out of an honest day's work.

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:51.200
Others prefer the story
that poor people are helpless

00:09:51.224 --> 00:09:54.505
and probably had neglectful parents
that didn't read to them enough,

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:56.738
and if they were just told what to do

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.019
and shown the right path,

00:09:58.043 --> 00:09:59.284
they could make it.

00:09:59.917 --> 00:10:06.056
For every story I hear demonizing
low-income single mothers

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.429
or absentee fathers,

00:10:07.453 --> 00:10:10.195
which is how people
might think of my parents,

00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:15.081
I've got 50 that tell a different story
about the same people,

00:10:15.105 --> 00:10:18.015
showing up every day and doing their best.

00:10:18.491 --> 00:10:22.207
I'm not saying that some
of the negative stories aren't true,

00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:28.595
but those stories allow us
to not really see who people really are,

00:10:28.619 --> 00:10:30.806
because they don't paint a full picture.

00:10:31.249 --> 00:10:35.098
The quarter-truths and limited
plot lines have us convinced

00:10:35.122 --> 00:10:38.380
that poor people are a problem
that needs fixing.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.839
What if we recognized
that what's working is the people

00:10:43.863 --> 00:10:46.417
and what's broken is our approach?

00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:49.966
What if we realized that the experts
we are looking for,

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.786
the experts we need to follow,

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.731
are poor people themselves?

00:10:53.755 --> 00:10:56.758
What if, instead of imposing solutions,

00:10:56.782 --> 00:10:58.881
we just added fire

00:10:58.905 --> 00:11:01.849
to the already-burning flame
that they have?

00:11:01.873 --> 00:11:04.030
Not directing --

00:11:04.054 --> 00:11:06.644
not even empowering --

00:11:06.668 --> 00:11:08.897
but just fueling their initiative.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.357
Just north of here,

00:11:11.381 --> 00:11:14.548
we have an example
of what this could look like:

00:11:14.572 --> 00:11:15.822
Silicon Valley.

00:11:16.497 --> 00:11:20.671
A whole venture capital industry
has grown up around the belief

00:11:20.695 --> 00:11:24.983
that if people have good ideas
and the desire to manifest them,

00:11:25.007 --> 00:11:29.004
we should give them lots
and lots and lots of money.

00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:30.150
(Laughter)

00:11:30.174 --> 00:11:34.015
Right? But where is our strategy
for Theresa and Baakir?

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:37.423
There are no incubators for them,

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:40.156
no accelerators, no fellowships.

00:11:40.577 --> 00:11:44.252
How are Jobana, Sintia and Bertha
really all that different

00:11:44.276 --> 00:11:46.914
from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world?

00:11:46.938 --> 00:11:49.922
Baakir has experience and a track record.

00:11:49.946 --> 00:11:51.655
I'd put my money on him.

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:59.405
So, consider this an invitation
to rethink a flawed strategy.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.960
Let's grasp this opportunity

00:12:02.984 --> 00:12:06.801
to let go of a tired, faulty narrative

00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:09.862
and listen and look for true stories,

00:12:09.886 --> 00:12:11.899
more beautifully complex stories,

00:12:11.923 --> 00:12:16.768
about who marginalized people
and families and communities are.

00:12:19.149 --> 00:12:22.272
I'm going to take a minute
to speak to my people.

00:12:27.986 --> 00:12:29.446
We cannot wait

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.850
for somebody else to get it right.

00:12:33.136 --> 00:12:36.292
Let us remember what we are capable of;

00:12:36.316 --> 00:12:40.185
all that we have built
with blood, sweat and dreams;

00:12:40.209 --> 00:12:41.988
all the cogs that keep turning;

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:45.684
and the people kept afloat
because of our backbreaking work.

00:12:45.708 --> 00:12:48.066
Let us remember that we are magic.

00:12:48.677 --> 00:12:51.597
If you need some inspiration
to jog your memory,

00:12:51.621 --> 00:12:54.591
read Octavia Butler's
"Parable of the Sower."

00:12:54.615 --> 00:12:58.004
Listen to Reverend King's
"Letter from Birmingham Jail."

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:02.648
Listen to Suheir Hammad recite
"First Writing Since,"

00:13:02.672 --> 00:13:05.721
or Esperanza Spalding
perform "Black Gold."

00:13:05.745 --> 00:13:08.393
Set your gaze upon the art
of Kehinde Wiley

00:13:08.417 --> 00:13:10.271
or Favianna Rodriguez.

00:13:10.914 --> 00:13:16.499
Look at the hands of your grandmother

00:13:16.523 --> 00:13:19.195
or into the eyes of someone who loves you.

00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:22.254
We are magic.

00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:25.957
Individually, we don't have
a lot of wealth and power,

00:13:25.981 --> 00:13:29.488
but collectively, we are unstoppable.

00:13:30.114 --> 00:13:32.385
And we spend a lot of our time and energy

00:13:32.409 --> 00:13:38.608
organizing our power to demand change
from systems that were not made for us.

00:13:39.489 --> 00:13:43.070
Instead of trying to alter
the fabric of existing ways,

00:13:43.094 --> 00:13:45.871
let's weave and cut some fierce new cloth.

00:13:46.355 --> 00:13:49.845
Let's use some of our
substantial collective power

00:13:49.869 --> 00:13:51.841
toward inventing and bringing to life

00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:54.812
new ways of being that work for us.

00:13:55.423 --> 00:14:00.358
Desmond Tutu talks
about the concept of ubuntu,

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:04.037
in the context of South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation process

00:14:04.061 --> 00:14:06.354
that they embarked on after apartheid.

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:08.713
He says it means,

00:14:08.737 --> 00:14:14.263
"My humanity is caught up,
is inextricably bound up, in yours;

00:14:14.287 --> 00:14:18.833
we belong to a bundle of life."

00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:22.568
A bundle of life.

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:25.807
The Truth and Reconciliation process

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:29.481
started by elevating
the voices of the unheard.

00:14:30.068 --> 00:14:36.009
If this country is going to live up to its
promise of liberty and justice for all,

00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:39.122
then we need to elevate
the voices of our unheard,

00:14:39.146 --> 00:14:42.627
of people like Jobana,
Sintia and Bertha,

00:14:42.651 --> 00:14:45.118
Theresa and Baakir.

00:14:45.809 --> 00:14:48.794
We must leverage their solutions
and their ideas.

00:14:49.437 --> 00:14:52.567
We must listen to their true stories,

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:55.241
their more beautifully complex stories.

00:14:55.956 --> 00:14:57.116
Thank you.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:02.984
(Applause)
