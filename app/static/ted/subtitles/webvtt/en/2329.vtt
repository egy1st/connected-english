WEBVTT

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.456
I'm here to recruit men
to support gender equality.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.616
(Cheers)

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.280
Wait, wait. What?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.496
What do men have to do
with gender equality?

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.496
Gender equality is about women, right?

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.040
I mean, the word gender is about women.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.496
Actually, I'm even here speaking
as a middle class white man.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.416
Now, I wasn't always
a middle class white man.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.840
It all happened for me about 30 years ago
when I was in graduate school,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.056
and a bunch of us graduate students
got together one day,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.736
and we said, you know,
there's an explosion

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.496
of writing and thinking
in feminist theory,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.416
but there's no courses yet.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.774
So we did what graduate students
typically do in a situation like that.

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:50.456
We said, OK, let's have a study group.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.056
We'll read a text, we'll talk about it,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.656
we'll have a potluck dinner.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.176
(Laughter)

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.696
So every week,
11 women and me got together.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.496
(Laughter)

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.456
We would read some text in feminist theory
and have a conversation about it.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.696
And during one of our conversations,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.840
I witnessed an interaction
that changed my life forever.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.720
It was a conversation between two women.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.896
One of the women was white,
and one was black.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.256
And the white woman said --

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.616
this is going to sound
very anachronistic now --

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.336
the white woman said, "All women
face the same oppression as women.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.176
All women are similarly
situated in patriarchy,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.816
and therefore all women have a kind
of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood."

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.480
And the black woman said,
"I'm not so sure.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.296
Let me ask you a question."

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.056
So the black woman
says to the white woman,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.936
"When you wake up in the morning
and you look in the mirror,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.176
what do you see?"

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.200
And the white woman said, "I see a woman."

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.016
And the black woman said,
"You see, that's the problem for me.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.536
Because when I wake up in the morning
and I look in the mirror," she said,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.936
"I see a black woman.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.040
To me, race is visible. But to you,
race is invisible. You don't see it."

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.455
And then she said
something really startling.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.320
She said, "That's how privilege works.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.920
Privilege is invisible
to those who have it."

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.936
It is a luxury, I will say
to the white people sitting in this room,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.696
not to have to think about race
every split second of our lives.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.560
Privilege is invisible
to those who have it.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.671
Now remember, I was
the only man in this group,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.776
so when I witnessed this, I went, "Oh no."

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.536
(Laughter)

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.896
And somebody said,
"Well what was that reaction?"

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.576
And I said, "Well, when I wake up
in the morning and I look in the mirror,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.496
I see a human being.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.976
I'm kind of the generic person.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.016
You know, I'm a middle class white man.
I have no race, no class, no gender.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.056
I'm universally generalizable."

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.896
(Laughter)

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.656
So I like to think that was the moment
I became a middle class white man,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.616
that class and race and gender
were not about other people,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.176
they were about me.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.376
I had to start thinking about them,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.400
and it had been privilege that had
kept it invisible to me for so long.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.867
Now, I wish I could tell you
this story ends 30 years ago

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.456
in that little discussion group,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.256
but I was reminded of it quite recently
at my university where I teach.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.216
I have a colleague, and she and I
both teach the sociology of gender course

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.096
on alternate semesters.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.496
So she gives a guest lecture
for me when I teach.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.896
I give a guest lecture
for her when she teaches.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.256
So I walk into her class
to give a guest lecture,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.456
about 300 students in the room,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.816
and as I walk in, one of the students
looks up and says,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.200
"Oh, finally, an objective opinion."

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.976
All that semester, whenever
my colleague opened her mouth,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.376
what my students saw was a woman.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.496
I mean, if you were to say to my students,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.976
"There is structural inequality
based on gender in the United States,"

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.016
they'd say, "Well of course
you'd say that.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.517
You're a woman. You're biased."

00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:58.416
When I say it, they go,
"Wow, is that interesting.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.440
Is that going to be on the test?
How do you spell 'structural'?"

00:04:01.464 --> 00:04:03.296
(Laughter)

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.576
So I hope you all can see,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.456
this is what objectivity looks like.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.216
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.496
Disembodied Western rationality.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.255
(Laughter)

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.760
And that, by the way, is why I think
men so often wear ties.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.056
(Laughter)

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.656
Because if you are going to embody
disembodied Western rationality,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.176
you need a signifier,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.416
and what could be a better signifier
of disembodied Western rationality

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.856
than a garment that at one end is a noose
and the other end points to the genitals?

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.640
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.520
That is mind-body dualism right there.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.176
So making gender visible to men

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.016
is the first step to engaging men
to support gender equality.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.376
Now, when men first hear
about gender equality,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.305
when they first start thinking about it,

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:07.816
they often think, many men think,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.096
well, that's right,
that's fair, that's just,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.120
that's the ethical imperative.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.696
But not all men.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.416
Some men think --
the lightning bolt goes off,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.256
and they go, "Oh my God,
yes, gender equality,"

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.000
and they will immediately begin
to mansplain to you your oppression.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.576
They see supporting gender equality
something akin to the cavalry,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.743
like, "Thanks very much for bringing this
to our attention, ladies,

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:36.967
we'll take it from here."

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.736
This results in a syndrome that I like
to call 'premature self-congratulation.'

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.056
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.176
There's another group, though,
that actively resists gender equality,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.896
that sees gender equality
as something that is detrimental to men.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.736
I was on a TV talk show
opposite four white men.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.936
This is the beginning of the book
I wrote, 'Angry White Men.'

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.656
These were four angry white men

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.536
who believed that they,
white men in America,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.040
were the victims of reverse discrimination
in the workplace.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.896
And they all told stories
about how they were qualified for jobs,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.136
qualified for promotions,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.416
they didn't get them,
they were really angry.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.616
And the reason I'm telling you this
is I want you to hear the title

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.296
of this particular show.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.456
It was a quote from one of the men,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.896
and the quote was,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.120
"A Black Woman Stole My Job."

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.936
And they all told their stories,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.096
qualified for jobs,
qualified for promotions,

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.456
didn't get it, really angry.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.256
And then it was my turn to speak,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.856
and I said, "I have
just one question for you guys,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.496
and it's about the title of the show,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.376
'A Black Woman Stole My Job.'

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.296
Actually, it's about
one word in the title.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.856
I want to know about the word 'my.'

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.560
Where did you get the idea
it was your job?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.576
Why isn't the title of the show,
'A Black Woman Got the Job?'

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.056
or 'A Black Woman Got A Job?'"

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.216
Because without confronting
men's sense of entitlement,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.536
I don't think we'll ever understand
why so many men resist gender equality.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.976
(Applause)

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.336
Look, we think this
is a level playing field,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.536
so any policy that tilts it
even a little bit,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.696
we think, "Oh my God,
water's rushing uphill.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.625
It's reverse discrimination against us."

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:25.856
(Laughter)

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.280
So let me be very clear:

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.896
white men in Europe and the United States

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.936
are the beneficiaries of the single
greatest affirmative action program

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.496
in the history of the world.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.576
It is called "the history of the world."

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.280
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.976
So, now I've established
some of the obstacles to engaging men,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.616
but why should we support gender equality?

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.096
Of course, it's fair,
it's right and it's just.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.576
But more than that,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.680
gender equality is also
in our interest as men.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.376
If you listen to what men say
about what they want in their lives,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.936
gender equality is actually a way
for us to get the lives we want to live.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.496
Gender equality is good for countries.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.576
It turns out, according to most studies,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.576
that those countries
that are the most gender equal

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.136
are also the countries that score highest
on the happiness scale.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.536
And that's not just because
they're all in Europe.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.776
(Laughter)

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.535
Even within Europe, those countries
that are more gender equal

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.159
also have the highest levels of happiness.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.000
It is also good for companies.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.456
Research by Catalyst and others
has shown conclusively

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.096
that the more gender-equal companies are,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.336
the better it is for workers,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.176
the happier their labor force is.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.056
They have lower job turnover.
They have lower levels of attrition.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.416
They have an easier time recruiting.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.376
They have higher rates of retention,
higher job satisfaction,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.616
higher rates of productivity.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.496
So the question I'm often asked
in companies is,

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.092
"Boy, this gender equality thing,
that's really going to be expensive, huh?"

00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:16.336
And I say, "Oh no, in fact,
what you have to start calculating

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.336
is how much gender inequality
is already costing you.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.280
It is extremely expensive."

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.600
So it is good for business.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.280
And the other thing is, it's good for men.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.016
It is good for the kind of lives
we want to live,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.976
because young men especially
have changed enormously,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.176
and they want to have lives
that are animated

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.936
by terrific relationships
with their children.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.696
They expect their partners,
their spouses, their wives,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.896
to work outside the home

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.416
and be just as committed
to their careers as they are.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.256
I was talking, to give you
an illustration of this change --

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.056
Some of you may remember this.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.176
When I was a lot younger,
there was a riddle that was posed to us.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.616
Some of you may wince
to remember this riddle.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.216
This riddle went something like this.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.576
A man and his son
are driving on the freeway,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.576
and they're in a terrible accident,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.856
and the father is killed,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.936
and the son is brought
to the hospital emergency room,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.016
and as they're bringing the son
into the hospital emergency room,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.656
the emergency room attending physician
sees the boy and says,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.016
"Oh, I can't treat him, that's my son."

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.400
How is this possible?

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.456
We were flummoxed by this.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.656
We could not figure this out.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.616
(Laughter)

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.776
Well, I decided to do a little experiment
with my 16-year old son.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.256
He had a bunch of his friends
hanging out at the house

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.576
watching a game on TV recently.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.816
So I decided I would pose
this riddle to them,

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.816
just to see, to gauge the level of change.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.896
Well, 16-year-old boys,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.936
they immediately turned to me
and said, "It's his mom." Right?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.736
No problem. Just like that.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.616
Except for my son, who said,
"Well, he could have two dads."

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:05.136
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.976
That's an index, an indicator
of how things have changed.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.816
Younger men today expect
to be able to balance work and family.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.136
They want to be dual-career,
dual-carer couples.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.856
They want to be able to balance
work and family with their partners.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.776
They want to be involved fathers.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.936
Now, it turns out

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.336
that the more egalitarian
our relationships,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.160
the happier both partners are.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.896
Data from psychologists and sociologists
are quite persuasive here.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.576
I think we have the persuasive numbers,
the data, to prove to men

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.776
that gender equality
is not a zero-sum game, but a win-win.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.576
Here's what the data show.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:56.136
Now, when men begin
the process of engaging

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.936
with balancing work and family,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.136
we often have two phrases
that we use to describe what we do.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.696
We pitch in and we help out.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.936
(Laughter)

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.856
And I'm going to propose
something a little bit more radical,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.096
one word: "share."

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.856
(Laughter)

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.536
Because here's what the data show:

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.856
when men share housework and childcare,

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.960
their children do better in school.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.216
Their children have lower rates
of absenteeism,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.776
higher rates of achievement.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.536
They are less likely
to be diagnosed with ADHD.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.416
They are less likely
to see a child psychiatrist.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.560
They are less likely
to be put on medication.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.920
So when men share housework and childcare,

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.696
their children are happier and healthier,

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.400
and men want this.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.936
When men share housework and childcare,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.600
their wives are happier. Duh.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.176
Not only that, their wives are healthier.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.391
Their wives are less likely
to see a therapist,

00:12:50.415 --> 00:12:52.463
less likely to be diagnosed
with depression,

00:12:52.487 --> 00:12:56.256
less likely to be put on medication,
more likely to go to the gym,

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.336
report higher levels
of marital satisfaction.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.376
So when men share housework and childcare,

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.256
their wives are happier and healthier,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.200
and men certainly want this as well.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.936
When men share housework and childcare,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.696
the men are healthier.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.536
They smoke less, drink less,
take recreational drugs less often.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.256
They are less likely to go to the ER

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.456
but more like to go to a doctor
for routine screenings.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.416
They are less likely to see a therapist,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.536
less likely to be diagnosed
with depression,

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.056
less likely to be taking
prescription medication.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.096
So when men share housework and childcare,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.296
the men are happier and healthier.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.680
And who wouldn't want that?

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.896
And finally,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.856
when men share housework and childcare,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.096
they have more sex.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.536
(Laughter)

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.976
Now, of these four fascinating findings,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.936
which one do you think
Men's Health magazine put on its cover?

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.576
(Laughter)

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.600
"Housework Makes Her Horny.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.016
(Not When She Does It.)"

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.696
(Laughter)

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.976
Now, I will say,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.976
just to remind the men in the audience,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.816
these data were collected
over a really long period of time,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.656
so I don't want listeners to say,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.696
"Hmm, OK, I think
I'll do the dishes tonight."

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.696
These data were collected
over a really long period of time.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.120
But I think it shows something important,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.936
that when Men's Health magazine
put it on their cover,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.199
they also called,
you'll love this, "Choreplay."

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.216
So, what we found
is something really important,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.336
that gender equality

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.416
is in the interest of countries,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.576
of companies, and of men,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.136
and their children and their partners,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.616
that gender equality
is not a zero-sum game.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.896
It's not a win-lose.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.136
It is a win-win for everyone.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.416
And what we also know

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.016
is we cannot fully empower women and girls

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.696
unless we engage boys and men.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.920
We know this.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.776
And my position is

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.016
that men need the very things
that women have identified

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.096
that they need to live the lives
they say they want to live

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.280
in order to live the lives
that we say we want to live.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.816
In 1915, on the eve of one
of the great suffrage demonstrations

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.816
down Fifth Avenue in New York City,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.496
a writer in New York
wrote an article in a magazine,

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.536
and the title of the article was,

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.360
"Feminism for Men."

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.136
And this was the first line
of that article:

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.136
"Feminism will make it possible
for the first time for men to be free."

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.376
Thank you.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:44.120
(Applause)
