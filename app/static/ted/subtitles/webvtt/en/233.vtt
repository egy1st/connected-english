00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Thank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I cannot believe I'm here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I have not slept in weeks.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized. (Laughter)

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
called 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
about how we all might join in and do similar things.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I was trying to finish my first book,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I was wandering around dazed every day

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I would walk around in a daze during the day.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day, but I had flexible hours.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
there are a lot of writers --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
it's like a very high per capita ratio

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of writers to normal people.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Meanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
My mom was a teacher, my sister became a teacher

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and after college so many of my friends went into teaching.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and how inspiring they were,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and they were really sort of the most hard-working

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and constantly inspiring people I knew.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But I knew so many of the things they were up against,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
so many of the struggles they were dealing with.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And one of them was that so many of my friends

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that were teaching in city schools were having trouble

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
with their students keeping up at grade level,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in their reading and writing in particular.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now, so many of these students had come from households

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
where English isn't spoken in the home,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
where a lot of them have different special needs,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
learning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
which sometimes and very often are under-funded.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And so they would talk to me about this and say,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
"You know, what we really need is just more people,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
more bodies, more one-on-one attention,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
more hours, more expertise from people

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now, I would say, "Well, why don't you just work with them one-on-one?"

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
How can we possibly give each student

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
even one hour a week of one-on-one attention?"

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And so we started talking about this.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And at the same time,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I thought about this massive group of people I knew:

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
writers, editors, journalists, graduate students,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
assistant professors, you name it.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and an interest in the English word --

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I hope to have an interest in the English language,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
but I'm not speaking it well right now. (Laughter)

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm trying. That clock has got me.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
in terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And so they had, you know, their time

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and their interest, but at the same time

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
there wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to bring these two communities together.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So when I moved back to San Francisco, we rented this building.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And the idea was to put McSweeney's --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
McSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and a few other magazines --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we were going to move it into an office for the first time.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We were going to move it into an office,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
why don't we just open up

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
the front of the building for students to come in there after school,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
get extra help on their written homework,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
so you have basically no border between these two communities?"

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So the idea was that we would be

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
working on whatever we're working on,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
You give those hours in the afternoon

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to the students in the neighborhood.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So, we had this place, we rented it,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the landlord was all for it. We did this mural,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
that's a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire history

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
of the printed word, in mural form -- it takes a long time

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So we rented this space.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And everything was great except the landlord said,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
"Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
You've gotta sell something.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
You can't just have a tutoring center."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So we thought, "Ha ha! Really!"

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
but we did all the necessary research.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
whitewashed beams and it had the look --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
while we were renovating this place, somebody said,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
"You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship."

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And we looked around and somebody else said,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
"Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer." (Laughter)

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and we said, "There's a point to that.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Let's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
we made it look sort of pirate supply-like.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Here you see planks sold by the foot

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and we have supplies to combat scurvy.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Up at the top, you see the eyepatch display,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
which is the black column there for everyday use

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
for your eyepatch, and then you have the pastel

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and other colors for stepping out at night --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
special occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So we opened this place. And this is a vat

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that we fill with treasures that students dig in.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
These are some signs that we have all over the place:

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
"Practical Joking with Pirates."

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
While you're reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counter

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and eight mop heads drop on your head.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
which is just a saltwater tank with three seats,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and then right behind it we set up this space,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
which was the tutoring center.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So right there is the tutoring center,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The kids would come in --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
or we thought they would come in. I should back up.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
We set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and months

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
renovating this place.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
We had tables, chairs, computers, everything.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Anyway, we bought 'em, we set everything up and then we waited.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It was started with about 12 of my friends,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and it just said, "Free Tutoring for Your English-Related

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and Writing-Related Needs -- Just Come In, It's All Free."

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And we thought, "Oh, they're going to storm the gates,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
they're gonna love it." And they didn't.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And so we waited, we sat at the tables, we waited and waited.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And everybody was becoming very discouraged

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
because it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And then somebody alerted us to the fact

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that maybe there was a trust gap,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
because we were operating behind a pirate supply store. (Laughter)

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
We never put it together, you know?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
a longtime San Francisco educator --

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
she was teaching in Mexico City,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
she had all the experience necessary,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
knew everything about education,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
She took over as executive director.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Immediately, she made the inroads with the teachers

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and the parents and the students and everything,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and so suddenly it was actually full every day.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And what we were trying to offer every day

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
was one-on-one attention.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
You know, it's been proven

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
a student can get one grade level higher.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
They come there, many times their parents --

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
you can't see it, but there's a church pew

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So that was the basis of it,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
was one-on-one attention.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And we found ourselves full every day with kids.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
If you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m.,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
2:30 p.m., you will get run over, often,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
by the kids and their big backpacks, or whatever, actually running to this space,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
which is very strange, because it's school, in a way.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
But there was something psychological happening there

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
that was just a little bit different.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And the other thing was, there was no stigma.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Kids weren't going into the "Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help,"

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
or something like that. It was 826 Valencia.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
First of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And so our interns were actually working

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
at the same tables very often,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And so it became a tutoring center --

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
publishing center, is what we called it --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and a writing center.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
They go in, and they might be working with a high school student

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
actually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids, too.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So there's no stigma.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
They're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
These adults, they're working in their field.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
They can lean over, ask a question of one of these adults

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and it all sort of feeds on each other.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
There's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
especially for the adults working at McSweeney's

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
was that there was just the one bathroom. (Laughter)

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention --

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
they go home, they're finished. They don't stall.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
They don't do their homework in front of the TV.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
They're allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
enjoy other hobbies, get outside, play.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And that makes a happy family.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So the key to it all is homework! (Laughter) (Applause)

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
There you have it, you know -- one-on-one attention.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So we started off with about 12 volunteers,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and then we had about 50,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and then a couple hundred.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
The key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
next to one student, concentrated attention,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
shining this beam of light on their work,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
on their thoughts and their self-expression,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
is going to be absolutely transformative,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
because so many of the students have not had that ever before.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So we said, "Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
it doesn't matter. That's going to be enough."

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Then we said, "Well, what are we

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
going to do with the space during the day,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?"

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So we started bringing in classes during the day.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So every day, there's a field trip where they together create a book --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
you can see it being typed up above.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
You just point a camera at a class,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and it always looks like this.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So this is one of the books that they do.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Notice the title of the book,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
"The Book That Was Never Checked Out: Titanic."

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And the first line of that book is, "Once there was a book named Cindy

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
that was about the Titanic."

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So, meanwhile, there's an adult in the back typing this up,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
taking it completely seriously, which blows their mind.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So then we still had more tutors to use.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
The teachers that we work with --

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
We went in there thinking,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
"We're ultimately, completely malleable. You're going to tell us.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
The neighborhood's going to tell us, the parents are going to tell us.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
The teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful."

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So then they said, "Why don't you come into the schools?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
necessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
or aren't close enough?" So then we started saying,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
"Well, we've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
"I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
We're working on our college essays. Send them in."

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
The teacher tells them what to do,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
how to do it, what their training is, what their project is so far.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
They work under the teacher's guide,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and it's all in one big room.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And that's actually the brunt of what we do is,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
people going straight from their workplace, straight from home,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
straight into the classroom and

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
working directly with the students.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
So then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Then another school said, "Well, what if we

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?"

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So this is the Everett Middle School Writers' Room,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
where we decorated it in buccaneer style.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
It's right off the library. And there we serve

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
all 529 kids in this middle school.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
This is their newspaper, the "Straight-Up News,"

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
in both languages -- English and Spanish.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
"Hey, why don't you assign a book with high school students?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world."

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
which is a school that we had worked with on some other things,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and we gave that assignment to the students.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And we said, "Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
She's going to publish them in a book.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it."

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
So these kids worked harder

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
than they've ever worked on anything in their lives,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
because there was that outside audience,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
there was Isabel Allende on the other end.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and so this worked out incredibly well.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
We had a big party at the end.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
"I Might Get Somewhere."

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And this became an ongoing thing. More and more books.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Now we're sort of addicted to the book thing.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
The kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
if they know it's going to be permanent,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
know it's going to be on a shelf,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
know that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
that we've honored their words, honored their thoughts

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
with hundreds of hours of five drafts, six drafts --

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
all this attention that we give to their thoughts.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And once they achieve that level, once they've written at that level,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
they can never go back.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
It's absolutely transformative.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
We sell all the student books.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Where else would you put them, right?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
with the stores. The store, actually --

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So it was paying the rent.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing --

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I don't know, I don't want to judge.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
But people would come in --

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and this was before the pirate movies and everything!

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
but it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
There's the ocean maps you can see on the left.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And it became a gateway to the community.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
People would come in and say, "What the --?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
What is this?" I don't want to swear on the web. (Laughter)

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Is that a rule? I don't know.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
They would say, "What is this?"

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And people would come in and learn more about it.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And then right beyond -- there's usually a little chain there --

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
right beyond, they would see the kids being tutored.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
This is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
and they might be more likely to buy some lard,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
or millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
or hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
So the store actually did really well.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
But it brought in so many people --

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
teachers, donors, volunteers, everybody --

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
because it was street level. It was open to the public.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
So, it became this sort of weird, happy accident.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
"Well, why don't we have a place like that here?"

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And a lot of them had been former educators

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
or would-be educators, so they combined

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
with a lot of local designers, local writers,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
and they just took the idea independently

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
and they did their own thing.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
They didn't want to sell pirate supplies.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
They didn't think that that was going to work there.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
So, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
This is Sam Potts' great design that did this.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And this was to make it look sort of like one of those

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
keysmith's shops that has to have every service

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
they've ever offered, you know, all over there.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costco

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
These are all handmade.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
These are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
All the packaging is done by Sam Potts.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
So then you have the villain containment unit,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
where kids put their parents. You have the office.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
it goes up an electric lift

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
and then the guy behind the counter tells you

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
that you have to recite the vow of heroism,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
which you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Personally, I think it's a problem.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
These are some of the products. These are all handmade.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
This is a secret identity kit.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
one American female marketing executive

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
from Hoboken, New Jersey. It's a full dossier

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
So, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
and then we turn on three hydraulic fans

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
from every side and then you can see the cape in action.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
There's nothing worse than, you know,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
So then, the secret door --

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
this is one of the shelves you don't see

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
when you walk in, but it slowly opens.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back. (Applause)

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
So you can see the full effect!

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
But this is -- I just want to emphasize --

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
locally funded, locally built.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
All the designers, all of the builders,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
everybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
I just came and visited and said, "Yes, you guys are doing great,"

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
or whatever. That was it. You can see the time

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
in all five boroughs of New York in the back. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
So this is the space during tutoring hours.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
It's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
complete devotion to the students' work

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
of creativity and ideas.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
And this switch is flicked in their heads

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
So it's school, but it's not school.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
It's clearly not school, even though

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
they're working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables, pencils and papers, whatever.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
This is one of the students, Khaled Hamdan.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
You can read this quote.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Came in. Got this concentrated attention.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And he couldn't escape it.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
So, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early --

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
got really addicted to finishing his homework early.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
It's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
and to have it checked, and to know he's going to achieve

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
the next thing and be prepared for school the next day.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
So he got hooked on that, and then he started doing other things.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
He's now been published in five books.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
called "Super-Has-Beens."

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
He wrote a series on "Penguin Balboa,"

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
which is a fighting -- a boxing -- penguin.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
at a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
He's evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
There's four family members that come in every day.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
So, I'll go through really quickly.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
This is L.A., The Echo Park Time Travel Mart:

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
"Whenever You Are, We're Already Then." (Laughter)

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
So you see everything: it's exactly as a 7-Eleven would be.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Leeches. Mammoth chunks. They even have their own Slurpee machine:

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
"Out of Order. Come Back Yesterday." (Laughter) (Applause)

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Anyway. So I'm going to jump ahead.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
These are spaces that are only affiliated with us,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
doing this same thing: Word St. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts;

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Ink Spot in Cincinnati; Youth Speaks, San Francisco, California,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
which inspired us; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis;

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Austin Bat Cave in Austin;

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Fighting Words in Dublin, Ireland, started by Roddy Doyle,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
this will be open in April.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Now I'm going to the TED Wish -- is that okay?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
All right, I've got a minute. So, the TED Wish:

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
I wish that you -- you personally and every creative individual

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
and organization you know -- will find a way

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
to directly engage with a public school in your area

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
and that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
so that within a year we have a thousand examples --

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
a thousand! -- of transformative partnerships.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Profound leaps forward!

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And these can be things that maybe you're already doing.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
I know that so many people in this room

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
are already doing really interesting things.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
I know that for a fact. So, tell us these stories and inspire others on the website.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
We created a website.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
I'm going to switch to "we," and not "I," hope:

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
a new era of participation in our public schools.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
We hope that you will take the lead

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
with that of innovative educators in your community.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Always let the teachers lead the way.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
They will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
There are a million ways.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
You can walk up to your local school

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
and consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
So, this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
they did this phenomenal job.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
This website is already up, it's already got a bunch of stories,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
a lot of ideas. It's called "Once Upon a School,"

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
which is a great title, I think.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
This site will document every story, every project that comes

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
out of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
and then you add your own projects once you get started.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So, visit the site.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
If you have any questions, you can ask this guy,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
who's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
You email him, he'll answer any question you possibly want.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
And he'll get you inspired and get you going

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
and guide you through the process so that you can affect change.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
And it can be fun! That's the point of this talk --

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000
it needn't be sterile. It needn't be bureaucratically untenable.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
You can do and use the skills that you have.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
The schools need you. The teachers need you.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Students and parents need you. They need your actual person:

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
your physical personhood and your open minds

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
and open ears and boundless compassion,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
sitting next to them, listening and nodding

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
and asking questions for hours at a time.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are:

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
how smart and how much they have to say.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
You can tell them. You can shine that light on them,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Thank you so much.
