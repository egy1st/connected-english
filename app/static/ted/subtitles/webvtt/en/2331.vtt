00:00:07.208 --> 00:00:09.144
A question I'm often asked is,

00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:13.975
where did I get my passion
for human rights and justice?

00:00:14.658 --> 00:00:15.842
It started early.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.792
I grew up in the west of Ireland,

00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:20.877
wedged between four brothers,

00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:23.298
two older than me and two younger than me.

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:26.906
So of course I had to be
interested in human rights,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.435
and equality and justice,

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:31.180
and using my elbows!

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:33.017
(Laughter)

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:36.030
And those issues stayed
with me and guided me,

00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:37.680
and in particular,

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:42.254
when I was elected the first
woman President of Ireland,

00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:45.174
from 1990 to 1997.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.056
I dedicated my presidency

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.537
to having a space for those who felt
marginalized on the island of Ireland,

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:56.290
and bringing together communities
from Northern Ireland

00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:58.054
with those from the Republic,

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:00.028
trying to build peace.

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:05.715
And I went as the first Irish president
to the United Kingdom

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:08.725
and met with Queen Elizabeth II,

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.557
and also welcomed to my
official residence --

00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:16.360
which we call "Áras an Uachtaráin,"
the house of the president --

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:18.630
members of the royal family,

00:01:18.654 --> 00:01:21.434
including, notably, the Prince of Wales.

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:28.308
And I was aware that at the time
of my presidency,

00:01:28.332 --> 00:01:33.304
Ireland was a country beginning
a rapid economic progress.

00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:40.540
We were a country that was benefiting
from the solidarity of the European Union.

00:01:41.607 --> 00:01:46.611
Indeed, when Ireland first joined
the European Union in 1973,

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:49.991
there were parts of the country
that were considered developing,

00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:53.495
including my own beloved
native county, County Mayo.

00:01:54.563 --> 00:01:58.874
I led trade delegations
here to the United States,

00:01:58.898 --> 00:02:01.784
to Japan, to India,

00:02:01.808 --> 00:02:05.074
to encourage investment,
to help to create jobs,

00:02:05.098 --> 00:02:06.424
to build up our economy,

00:02:06.448 --> 00:02:08.742
to build up our health system,
our education --

00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:10.107
our development.

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:13.976
What I didn't have to do as president

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.641
was buy land on mainland Europe,

00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:24.901
so that Irish citizens could go there
because our island was going underwater.

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.341
What I didn't have to think about,

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:30.040
either as president
or as a constitutional lawyer,

00:02:30.064 --> 00:02:33.716
was the implications
for the sovereignty of the territory

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.333
because of the impact of climate change.

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:42.080
But that is what President Tong,
of the Republic of Kiribati,

00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:44.855
has to wake up every morning
thinking about.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.728
He has bought land in Fiji
as an insurance policy,

00:02:50.752 --> 00:02:53.748
what he calls, "migration with dignity,"

00:02:54.537 --> 00:02:59.101
because he knows that his people
may have to leave their islands.

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:05.383
As I listened to President Tong
describing the situation,

00:03:05.407 --> 00:03:11.778
I really felt that this was a problem
that no leader should have to face.

00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:17.960
And as I heard him speak
about the pain of his problems,

00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:20.380
I thought about Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:26.079
I thought about her
and those who worked with her

00:03:26.103 --> 00:03:31.181
on the Commission on Human Rights,
which she chaired in 1948,

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:35.217
and drew up the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

00:03:36.036 --> 00:03:39.614
For them, it would have been unimaginable

00:03:39.638 --> 00:03:44.272
that a whole country
could go out of existence

00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:47.717
because of human-induced climate change.

00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:52.490
I came to climate change not as
a scientist or an environmental lawyer,

00:03:52.514 --> 00:03:56.473
and I wasn't really impressed
by the images of polar bears

00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:58.107
or melting glaciers.

00:03:58.131 --> 00:04:01.655
It was because of the impact on people,

00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:05.077
and the impact on their rights --

00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:10.232
their rights to food and safe water,
health, education and shelter.

00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:14.633
And I say this with humility,

00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:18.592
because I came late
to the issue of climate change.

00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:20.045
When I served

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.069
as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights

00:04:22.093 --> 00:04:25.323
from 1997 to 2002,

00:04:25.347 --> 00:04:27.553
climate change wasn't
at the front of my mind.

00:04:27.577 --> 00:04:31.474
I don't remember making
a single speech on climate change.

00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:34.801
I knew that there was another
part of the United Nations --

00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:36.983
the UN Convention on Climate Change --

00:04:37.007 --> 00:04:40.728
that was dealing with
the issue of climate change.

00:04:40.752 --> 00:04:45.112
It was later when I started
to work in African countries

00:04:45.136 --> 00:04:48.404
on issues of development and human rights.

00:04:48.428 --> 00:04:51.690
And I kept hearing
this pervasive sentence:

00:04:51.714 --> 00:04:56.065
"Oh, but things are so much worse now,
things are so much worse."

00:04:56.502 --> 00:04:59.868
And then I explored what was behind that;

00:04:59.892 --> 00:05:03.201
it was about changes in the climate --

00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:06.145
climate shocks, changes in the weather.

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:08.887
I met Constance Okollet,

00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:12.069
who had formed a women's group
in Eastern Uganda,

00:05:12.093 --> 00:05:14.720
and she told me that
when she was growing up,

00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:19.077
she had a very normal life in her village
and they didn't go hungry,

00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:24.430
they knew that the seasons would come
as they were predicted to come,

00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:27.231
they knew when to sow
and they knew when to harvest,

00:05:27.255 --> 00:05:29.627
and so they had enough food.

00:05:30.008 --> 00:05:32.333
But, in recent years,

00:05:32.357 --> 00:05:34.281
at the time of this conversation,

00:05:34.305 --> 00:05:37.535
they had nothing
but long periods of drought,

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:39.210
and then flash flooding,

00:05:39.234 --> 00:05:40.955
and then more drought.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.821
The school had been destroyed,

00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:44.384
livelihoods had been destroyed,

00:05:44.408 --> 00:05:46.182
their harvest had been destroyed.

00:05:46.206 --> 00:05:50.812
She forms this women's group
to try to keep her community together.

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.329
And this was a reality
that really struck me,

00:05:56.353 --> 00:06:00.738
because of course,
Constance Okollet wasn't responsible

00:06:00.762 --> 00:06:04.428
for the greenhouse gas emissions
that were causing this problem.

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:08.951
Indeed, I was very struck
about the situation in Malawi

00:06:08.975 --> 00:06:10.857
in January of this year.

00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:14.008
There was an unprecedented
flooding in the country,

00:06:14.032 --> 00:06:16.414
it covered about a third of the country,

00:06:16.438 --> 00:06:18.604
over 300 people were killed,

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.921
and hundreds of thousands
lost their livelihoods.

00:06:22.388 --> 00:06:25.484
And the average person in Malawi

00:06:25.508 --> 00:06:30.451
emits about 80 kg of CO2 a year.

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:36.690
The average US citizen emits
about 17.5 metric tons.

00:06:37.126 --> 00:06:40.817
So those who are suffering
disproportionately

00:06:40.841 --> 00:06:47.682
don't drive cars, don't have electricity,
don't consume very significantly,

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:50.864
and yet they are feeling more and more

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:55.277
the impacts of the changes in the climate,

00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:59.570
the changes that are preventing them
from knowing how to grow food properly,

00:06:59.594 --> 00:07:03.213
and knowing how
to look after their future.

00:07:03.514 --> 00:07:10.514
I think it was really
the importance of the injustice

00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:14.037
that really struck me very forcibly.

00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:21.061
And I know that we're not able
to address some of that injustice

00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:24.603
because we're not on course
for a safe world.

00:07:24.627 --> 00:07:31.016
Governments around the world agreed
at the conference in Copenhagen,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.754
and have repeated it
at every conference on climate,

00:07:34.778 --> 00:07:38.238
that we have to stay
below two degrees Celsius

00:07:38.262 --> 00:07:41.649
of warming above pre-Industrial standards.

00:07:41.673 --> 00:07:44.585
But we're on course
for about four degrees.

00:07:44.609 --> 00:07:49.482
So we face an existential threat
to the future of our planet.

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:51.126
And that made me realize

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:57.233
that climate change is the greatest threat
to human rights in the 21st century.

00:07:57.566 --> 00:08:01.201
And that brought me then
to climate justice.

00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:05.384
Climate justice responds
to the moral argument --

00:08:05.408 --> 00:08:07.440
both sides of the moral argument --

00:08:07.464 --> 00:08:09.882
to address climate change.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.057
First of all,

00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:14.945
to be on the side of those who are
suffering most and are most effected.

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:16.651
And secondly,

00:08:16.675 --> 00:08:21.676
to make sure that they're not left behind
again, when we start to move

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.509
and start to address climate change
with climate action,

00:08:24.533 --> 00:08:26.055
as we are doing.

00:08:27.834 --> 00:08:30.628
In our very unequal world today,

00:08:30.652 --> 00:08:34.231
it's very striking how many
people are left behind.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:40.937
In our world of 7.2 billion people,
about 3 billion are left behind.

00:08:41.262 --> 00:08:45.675
1.3 billion don't have access
to electricity,

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:49.203
and they light their homes
with kerosene and candles,

00:08:49.227 --> 00:08:50.902
both of which are dangerous.

00:08:50.926 --> 00:08:57.417
And in fact they spend a lot of their
tiny income on that form of lighting.

00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:01.294
2.6 billion people cook on open fires --

00:09:01.794 --> 00:09:05.303
on coal, wood and animal dung.

00:09:05.327 --> 00:09:10.001
And this causes
about 4 million deaths a year

00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:12.247
from indoor smoke inhalation,

00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:16.181
and of course, most of those
who die are women.

00:09:16.792 --> 00:09:20.633
So we have a very unequal world,

00:09:21.046 --> 00:09:27.101
and we need to change
from "business as usual."

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:33.189
And we shouldn't underestimate
the scale and the transformative nature

00:09:33.213 --> 00:09:35.950
of the change which will be needed,

00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:42.563
because we have to go to zero
carbon emissions by about 2050,

00:09:42.587 --> 00:09:46.952
if we're going to stay below
two degrees Celsius of warming.

00:09:46.976 --> 00:09:51.976
And that means we have to leave
about two-thirds of the known resources

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.207
of fossil fuels in the ground.

00:09:54.564 --> 00:09:56.287
It's a very big change,

00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:58.843
and it means that obviously,

00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:01.509
industrialized countries
must cut their emissions,

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:03.604
must become much more energy-efficient,

00:10:03.628 --> 00:10:07.564
and must move as quickly as possible
to renewable energy.

00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:12.579
For developing countries
and emerging economies,

00:10:12.603 --> 00:10:17.160
the problem and the challenge
is to grow without emissions,

00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:20.498
because they must develop;
they have very poor populations.

00:10:20.522 --> 00:10:26.282
So they must develop without emissions,
and that is a different kind of problem.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:31.605
Indeed, no country in the world
has actually grown without emissions.

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.536
All the countries have developed
with fossil fuels,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.858
and then may be moving
to renewable energy.

00:10:36.882 --> 00:10:39.221
So it is a very big challenge,

00:10:39.245 --> 00:10:43.955
and it requires the total support
of the international community,

00:10:43.979 --> 00:10:48.915
with the necessary finance and technology,
and systems and support,

00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:55.701
because no country can make itself safe
from the dangers of climate change.

00:10:56.007 --> 00:11:00.655
This is an issue that requires
complete human solidarity.

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:04.643
Human solidarity, if you like,
based on self-interest --

00:11:04.667 --> 00:11:06.947
because we are all in this together,

00:11:06.971 --> 00:11:08.366
and we have to work together

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.780
to ensure that we reach
zero carbon by 2050.

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:17.438
The good news is that change is happening,

00:11:17.462 --> 00:11:19.366
and it's happening very fast.

00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:21.405
Here in California,

00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:25.435
there's a very ambitious
emissions target to cut emissions.

00:11:25.966 --> 00:11:28.771
In Hawaii, they're passing legislation

00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:33.421
to have 100 percent
renewable energy by 2045.

00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:37.381
And governments are very ambitious
around the world.

00:11:37.731 --> 00:11:42.398
In Costa Rica, they have committed
to being carbon-neutral by 2021.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:49.178
In Ethiopia, the commitment
is to be carbon-neutral by 2027.

00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:56.136
Apple have pledged that their factories
in China will use renewable energy.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.293
And there is a race on at the moment

00:11:59.317 --> 00:12:03.254
to convert electricity
from tidal and wave power,

00:12:03.278 --> 00:12:07.497
in order that we can leave
the coal in the ground.

00:12:07.521 --> 00:12:12.344
And that change is both welcome
and is happening very rapidly.

00:12:12.368 --> 00:12:13.753
But it's still not enough,

00:12:13.777 --> 00:12:16.044
and the political will
is still not enough.

00:12:16.475 --> 00:12:21.442
Let me come back to President Tong
and his people in Kiribati.

00:12:22.077 --> 00:12:28.868
They actually could be able to live
on their island and have a solution,

00:12:28.892 --> 00:12:31.113
but it would take a lot of political will.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.748
President Tong told me
about his ambitious idea

00:12:35.772 --> 00:12:42.132
to either build up or even float
the little islands where his people live.

00:12:43.018 --> 00:12:47.084
This, of course, is beyond
the resources of Kiribati itself.

00:12:47.425 --> 00:12:51.156
It would require great solidarity
and support from other countries,

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.402
and it would require
the kind of imaginative idea

00:12:55.426 --> 00:12:59.979
that we bring together when we want
to have a space station in the air.

00:13:00.436 --> 00:13:05.291
But wouldn't it be wonderful
to have this engineering wonder

00:13:05.315 --> 00:13:08.848
and to allow a people to remain
in their sovereign territory,

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:11.991
and be part of the community of nations?

00:13:12.015 --> 00:13:16.798
That is the kind of idea
that we should be thinking about.

00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:22.455
Yes, the challenges
of the transformation we need are big,

00:13:22.479 --> 00:13:25.027
but they can be solved.

00:13:25.051 --> 00:13:27.082
We are actually, as a people,

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:30.400
very capable of coming together
to solve problems.

00:13:30.806 --> 00:13:34.440
I was very conscious of this
as I took part this year

00:13:34.464 --> 00:13:38.221
in commemoration of the 70th anniversary

00:13:38.245 --> 00:13:42.910
of the end of the Second
World War in 1945.

00:13:43.744 --> 00:13:46.345
1945 was an extraordinary year.

00:13:47.367 --> 00:13:49.973
It was a year when the world faced

00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:53.524
what must have seemed almost
insoluble problems --

00:13:53.548 --> 00:13:58.097
the devastation of the world wars,
particularly the Second World War;

00:13:58.121 --> 00:14:01.328
the fragile peace that had
been brought about;

00:14:01.352 --> 00:14:03.986
the need for a whole
economic regeneration.

00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:08.868
But the leaders of that time
didn't flinch from this.

00:14:08.892 --> 00:14:13.222
They had the capacity, they had
a sense of being driven by

00:14:13.246 --> 00:14:17.297
never again must the world
have this kind of problem.

00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:21.037
And they had to build structures
for peace and security.

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:24.522
And what did we get?
What did they achieve?

00:14:24.546 --> 00:14:27.165
The Charter of the United Nations,

00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:30.740
the Bretton Woods institutions,
as they're called, The World Bank,

00:14:30.764 --> 00:14:33.201
and the International Monetary Fund.

00:14:33.225 --> 00:14:36.599
A Marshall Plan for Europe,
a devastated Europe,

00:14:36.623 --> 00:14:38.545
to reconstruct it.

00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:40.630
And indeed a few years later,

00:14:40.654 --> 00:14:43.807
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

00:14:44.364 --> 00:14:49.978
2015 is a year that is similar
in its importance

00:14:50.002 --> 00:14:54.853
to 1945, with similar challenges
and similar potential.

00:14:55.377 --> 00:14:58.400
There will be two big summits this year:

00:14:58.424 --> 00:15:01.203
the first one, in September in New York,

00:15:01.227 --> 00:15:04.512
is the summit for the sustainable
development goals.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:10.549
And then the summit in Paris in December,
to give us a climate agreement.

00:15:11.365 --> 00:15:17.692
The sustainable development goals
are intended to help countries

00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:21.826
to live sustainably,
in tune with Mother Earth,

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:27.176
not to take out of Mother Earth
and destroy ecosystems,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.814
but rather, to live in harmony
with Mother Earth,

00:15:30.838 --> 00:15:34.667
by living under sustainable development.

00:15:34.691 --> 00:15:37.064
And the sustainable development goals

00:15:37.088 --> 00:15:39.473
will come into operation for all countries

00:15:39.497 --> 00:15:42.369
on January 1, 2016.

00:15:42.814 --> 00:15:43.991
The climate agreement --

00:15:44.015 --> 00:15:45.531
a binding climate agreement --

00:15:45.555 --> 00:15:49.219
is needed because
of the scientific evidence

00:15:49.243 --> 00:15:52.160
that we're on a trajectory
for about a four-degree world

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:55.672
and we have to change course
to stay below two degrees.

00:15:56.033 --> 00:16:01.557
So we need to take steps
that will be monitored and reviewed,

00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:05.979
so that we can keep increasing
the ambition of how we cut emissions,

00:16:06.003 --> 00:16:09.119
and how we move more rapidly
to renewable energy,

00:16:09.143 --> 00:16:12.146
so that we have a safe world.

00:16:15.665 --> 00:16:21.848
The reality is that this issue
is much too important

00:16:21.872 --> 00:16:25.435
to be left to politicians
and to the United Nations.

00:16:25.459 --> 00:16:26.460
(Laughter)

00:16:26.484 --> 00:16:28.062
It's an issue for all of us,

00:16:28.086 --> 00:16:32.050
and it's an issue where we need
more and more momentum.

00:16:32.911 --> 00:16:36.396
Indeed, the face of
the environmentalist has changed,

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.729
because of the justice dimension.

00:16:38.753 --> 00:16:41.973
It's now an issue
for faith-based organizations,

00:16:41.997 --> 00:16:45.169
under very good leadership
from Pope Francis,

00:16:45.193 --> 00:16:46.965
and indeed, the Church of England,

00:16:46.989 --> 00:16:49.432
which is divesting from fossil fuels.

00:16:49.456 --> 00:16:53.214
It's an issue for the business community,

00:16:53.238 --> 00:16:54.642
and the good news is

00:16:54.666 --> 00:16:57.576
that the business community
is changing very rapidly --

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.785
except for the fossil fuel industries --

00:16:59.809 --> 00:17:01.404
(Laughter)

00:17:01.428 --> 00:17:04.724
Even they are beginning
to slightly change their language --

00:17:04.748 --> 00:17:05.729
but only slightly.

00:17:05.753 --> 00:17:10.444
But business is not only moving rapidly
to the benefits of renewable energy,

00:17:10.468 --> 00:17:13.191
but is urging politicians
to give them more signals,

00:17:13.215 --> 00:17:15.190
so that they can move even more rapidly.

00:17:15.214 --> 00:17:17.215
It's an issue for the trade
union movement.

00:17:17.239 --> 00:17:19.262
It's an issue for the women's movement.

00:17:19.286 --> 00:17:21.364
It's an issue for young people.

00:17:21.388 --> 00:17:27.190
I was very struck when I learned
that Jibreel Khazan,

00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:32.858
one of the Greensboro Four who had
taken part in the Woolworth sit-ins,

00:17:32.882 --> 00:17:34.396
said quite recently that

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:40.422
climate change is the lunch counter
moment for young people.

00:17:40.446 --> 00:17:44.734
So, lunch counter moment
for young people of the 21st century --

00:17:44.758 --> 00:17:49.099
the sort of real human rights issue
of the 21st century,

00:17:49.123 --> 00:17:51.893
because he said it is
the greatest challenge

00:17:51.917 --> 00:17:55.509
to humanity and justice in our world.

00:17:56.391 --> 00:18:00.497
I recall very much
the Climate March last September,

00:18:00.521 --> 00:18:02.322
and that was a huge momentum,

00:18:02.346 --> 00:18:05.308
not just in New York,
but all around the world.

00:18:05.332 --> 00:18:07.602
and we have to build on that.

00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:10.737
I was marching with some
of The Elders family,

00:18:10.761 --> 00:18:15.788
and I saw a placard
a little bit away from me,

00:18:15.812 --> 00:18:17.766
but we were wedged so closely together --

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.465
because after all, there were 400,000
people out in the streets of New York --

00:18:21.489 --> 00:18:23.402
so I couldn't quite get to that placard,

00:18:23.426 --> 00:18:26.507
I would have just liked to have been
able to step behind it,

00:18:26.531 --> 00:18:28.977
because it said, "Angry Grannies!"

00:18:29.001 --> 00:18:30.324
(Laughter)

00:18:30.348 --> 00:18:31.802
That's what I felt.

00:18:31.826 --> 00:18:35.799
And I have five grandchildren now,

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:40.111
I feel very happy as an Irish grandmother
to have five grandchildren,

00:18:40.135 --> 00:18:43.178
and I think about their world,

00:18:43.202 --> 00:18:46.363
and what it will be
like when they will share that world

00:18:46.387 --> 00:18:50.433
with about 9 billion other people in 2050.

00:18:51.574 --> 00:18:56.229
We know that inevitably it will
be a climate-constrained world,

00:18:56.253 --> 00:18:59.102
because of the emissions
we've already put up there,

00:18:59.126 --> 00:19:04.523
but it could be a world that is much
more equal and much fairer,

00:19:04.547 --> 00:19:07.129
and much better for health,
and better for jobs

00:19:07.153 --> 00:19:09.125
and better for energy security,

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:10.976
than the world we have now,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000
if we have switched sufficiently
and early enough to renewable energy,

00:19:18.222 --> 00:19:20.654
and no one is left behind.

00:19:20.678 --> 00:19:23.073
No one is left behind.

00:19:23.736 --> 00:19:27.316
And just as we've been
looking back this year --

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:32.847
in 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years --

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:35.435
I would like to think
that they will look back,

00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:40.308
that world will look back
35 years from 2050,

00:19:40.332 --> 00:19:43.206
35 years to 2015,

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.048
and that they will say,

00:19:46.072 --> 00:19:50.179
"Weren't they good
to do what they did in 2015?

00:19:50.203 --> 00:19:55.678
We really appreciate that they took
the decisions that made a difference,

00:19:55.702 --> 00:19:58.640
and that put the world
on the right pathway,

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:01.370
and we benefit now from that pathway,"

00:20:01.394 --> 00:20:05.275
that they will feel that somehow
we took our responsibilities,

00:20:05.299 --> 00:20:09.458
we did what was done
in 1945 in similar terms,

00:20:09.482 --> 00:20:11.903
we didn't miss the opportunity,

00:20:11.927 --> 00:20:14.109
we lived up to our responsibilities.

00:20:14.133 --> 00:20:17.305
That's what this year is about.

00:20:17.688 --> 00:20:19.038
And somehow for me,

00:20:19.062 --> 00:20:23.356
it's captured in words of somebody
that I admired very much.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.713
She was a mentor of mine,
she was a friend,

00:20:25.737 --> 00:20:27.685
she died much too young,

00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:29.714
she was an extraordinary personality,

00:20:29.738 --> 00:20:32.222
a great champion of the environment:

00:20:32.246 --> 00:20:34.070
Wangari Maathai.

00:20:34.627 --> 00:20:37.253
Wangari said once,

00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:39.231
"In the course of history,

00:20:39.255 --> 00:20:43.266
there comes a time
when humanity is called upon

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:48.041
to shift to a new level of consciousness,

00:20:48.065 --> 00:20:51.522
to reach a higher moral ground."

00:20:52.135 --> 00:20:54.054
And that's what we have to do.

00:20:54.078 --> 00:20:57.366
We have to reach
a new level of consciousness,

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.357
a higher moral ground.

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:03.632
And we have to do it this year
in those two big summits.

00:21:04.108 --> 00:21:07.706
And that won't happen unless
we have the momentum

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.877
from people around the world who say:

00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:12.421
"We want action now,

00:21:12.445 --> 00:21:14.016
we want to change course,

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.413
we want a safe world,

00:21:15.437 --> 00:21:17.612
a safe world for future generations,

00:21:17.636 --> 00:21:20.244
a safe world for our children
and our grandchildren,

00:21:20.268 --> 00:21:22.539
and we're all in this together."

00:21:22.563 --> 00:21:23.723
Thank you.

00:21:23.747 --> 00:21:28.992
(Applause)
