WEBVTT

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.256
Wow, what an honor. I always wondered
what this would feel like.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.055
So eight years ago,
I got the worst career advice of my life.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.536
I had a friend tell me,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.496
"Don't worry about how much
you like the work you're doing now.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.536
It's all about just building your resume."

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.216
And I'd just come back
from living in Spain for a while,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.574
and I'd joined this Fortune 500 company.
I thought, "This is fantastic.

00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:22.614
I'm going to have
big impact on the world."

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:25.336
I had all these ideas.
And within about two months,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.360
I noticed at about 10am every morning
I had this strange urge

00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:31.936
to want to slam my head
through the monitor of my computer.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.865
I don't know if anyone's ever felt that.

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:37.416
And I noticed pretty soon after that
that all the competitors in our space

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.336
had already automated my job role.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.576
And this is right about when I got
this sage advice to build up my resume.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.616
Well, as I'm trying to figure out

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.136
what two-story window I'm going
to jump out of and change things up,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.896
I read some altogether different advice
from Warren Buffett, and he said,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.536
"Taking jobs to build up your resume
is the same as saving up sex for old age."

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.296
(Laughter)

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.616
And I heard that,
and that was all I needed.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.856
Within two weeks, I was out of there,
and I left with one intention:

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.936
to find something that I could screw up.
That's how tough it was.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.976
I wanted to have some type of impact.
It didn't matter what it was.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.715
And I found pretty quickly
that I wasn't alone:

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:21.576
it turns out that over 80 percent
of the people around

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.096
don't enjoy their work.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.656
I'm guessing this room is different,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.536
but that's the average
that Deloitte has done with their studies.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.608
So I wanted to find out,
what is it that sets these people apart,

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.968
the people who do the passionate,
world-changing work,

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.616
that wake up inspired every day,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.416
and then these people,
the other 80 percent

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.496
who lead these lives of quiet desperation.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.776
So I started to interview all these people
doing this inspiring work,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.616
and I read books and did case studies,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.336
300 books altogether
on purpose and career and all this,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.680
totally just self-immersion,
really for the selfish reason of --

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.736
I wanted to find the work
that I couldn't not do,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.296
what that was for me.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.962
But as I was doing this,
more and more people started to ask me,

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:00.456
"You're into this career thing.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.696
I don't like my job.
Can we sit down for lunch?"

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.896
I'd say, "Sure."
But I would have to warn them,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.216
because at this point,
my quit rate was also 80 percent.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.466
Of the people I'd sit down with for lunch,
80 percent would quit their job

00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:11.656
within two months.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.896
I was proud of this, and it wasn't
that I had any special magic.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.968
It was that I would ask
one simple question.

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.608
It was, "Why are you doing
the work that you're doing?"

00:02:20.632 --> 00:02:22.736
And so often their answer would be,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.056
"Well, because somebody
told me I'm supposed to."

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.216
And I realized that so many
people around us

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.856
are climbing their way up this ladder
that someone tells them to climb,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.416
and it ends up being leaned up
against the wrong wall,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.096
or no wall at all.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.816
The more time I spent around
these people and saw this problem,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.056
I thought, what if we could
create a community,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.456
a place where people
could feel like they belonged

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.623
and that it was OK
to do things differently,

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:47.362
to take the road less traveled,
where that was encouraged,

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:49.936
and inspire people to change?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.656
And that later became
what I now call Live Your Legend,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.347
which I'll explain in a little bit.

00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:58.056
But as I've made these discoveries,
I noticed a framework

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.461
of really three simple things

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:02.616
that all these different passionate
world-changers have in common,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.296
whether you're a Steve Jobs
or if you're just, you know,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.376
the person that has
the bakery down the street.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.416
But you're doing work
that embodies who you are.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.336
I want to share those three with you,
so we can use them as a lens

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.027
for the rest of today
and hopefully the rest of our life.

00:03:15.051 --> 00:03:17.827
The first part of this three-step
passionate work framework

00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:20.776
is becoming a self-expert
and understanding yourself,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.456
because if you don't know
what you're looking for,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.096
you're never going to find it.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.740
And the thing is that no one
is going to do this for us.

00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:31.456
There's no major in university
on passion and purpose and career.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.736
I don't know how that's not
a required double major,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.576
but don't even get me started on that.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.576
I mean, you spend more time
picking out a dorm room TV set

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.536
than you do you picking your major
and your area of study.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.176
But the point is,
it's on us to figure that out,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.416
and we need a framework,
we need a way to navigate through this.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.298
And so the first step of our compass is
finding out what our unique strengths are.

00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:54.336
What are the things that we wake up
loving to do no matter what,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.856
whether we're paid or we're not paid,
the things that people thank us for?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.856
And the Strengths Finder 2.0
is a book and also an online tool.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.616
I highly recommend it for sorting out
what it is that you're naturally good at.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.056
And next, what's our framework
or our hierarchy for making decisions?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.296
Do we care about the people,
our family, health,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.456
or is it achievement, success,
all this stuff?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.147
We have to figure out what it is
to make these decisions,

00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:19.896
so we know what our soul is made of,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.616
so that we don't go selling it
to some cause we don't give a shit about.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.336
And then the next step is our experiences.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.816
All of us have these experiences.
We learn things every day, every minute

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.536
about what we love, what we hate,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.560
what we're good at,
what we're terrible at.

00:04:35.584 --> 00:04:37.976
And if we don't spend time
paying attention to that

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.536
and assimilating that learning

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.536
and applying it to the rest of our lives,
it's all for nothing.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.216
Every day, every week,
every month of every year

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.696
I spend some time
just reflecting on what went right,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.863
what went wrong,
and what do I want to repeat,

00:04:49.887 --> 00:04:51.463
what can I apply more to my life.

00:04:51.487 --> 00:04:54.576
And even more so than that,
as you see people, especially today,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.981
who inspire you, who are doing
things where you say

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.936
"Oh God, what Jeff is doing,
I want to be like him."

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.681
Why are you saying that?
Open up a journal.

00:05:01.706 --> 00:05:03.776
Write down what it is about them
that inspires you.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.856
It's not going to be
everything about their life,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.696
but whatever it is, take note on that,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.016
so over time we'll have
this repository of things

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.256
that we can use to apply to our life
and have a more passionate existence

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.776
and make a better impact.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.181
Because when we start
to put these things together,

00:05:18.205 --> 00:05:21.496
we can then define
what success actually means to us,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.656
and without these different parts
of the compass, it's impossible.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.300
We end up in the situation --
we have that scripted life

00:05:27.324 --> 00:05:30.456
that everybody seems to be living
going up this ladder to nowhere.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.136
It's kind of like in Wall Street 2,
if anybody saw that,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.976
the peon employee asks
the big Wall Street banker CEO,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.136
"What's your number?
Everyone's got a number,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.696
where if they make this money,
they'll leave it all."

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.240
He says, "Oh, it's simple. More."

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.416
And he just smiles.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.216
And it's the sad state
of most of the people

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.776
that haven't spent time
understanding what matters for them,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.536
who keep reaching for something
that doesn't mean anything to us,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.056
but we're doing it because everyone
said we're supposed to.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.816
But once we have this framework together,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.456
we can start to identify
the things that make us come alive.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.696
You know, before this, a passion
could come and hit you in the face,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.416
or maybe in your possible line of work,
you might throw it away

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.631
because you don't have
a way of identifying it.

00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:12.191
But once you do, you can see something
that's congruent with my strengths,

00:06:12.215 --> 00:06:14.016
my values, who I am as a person,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.326
so I'm going to grab ahold of this,
I'm going to do something with it,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.208
and I'm going to pursue it
and try to make an impact with it.

00:06:20.232 --> 00:06:22.776
And Live Your Legend
and the movement we've built

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.467
wouldn't exist if I didn't have
this compass to identify,

00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:28.736
"Wow, this is something I want to pursue
and make a difference with."

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.816
If we don't know what we're looking for,
we're never going to find it,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.376
but once we have
this framework, this compass,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.856
then we can move on to what's next --
and that's not me up there --

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.096
doing the impossible
and pushing our limits.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.136
There's two reasons
why people don't do things.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.136
One is they tell themselves
they can't do them,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.296
or people around them
tell them they can't do them.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.856
Either way, we start to believe it.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.256
Either we give up,
or we never start in the first place.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.176
The things is, everything was impossible
until somebody did it.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.736
Every invention,
every new thing in the world,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.427
people thought were crazy at first.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.880
Roger Bannister and the four-minute mile,
it was a physical impossibility

00:07:01.904 --> 00:07:04.296
to break the four-minute mile
in a foot race

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.336
until Roger Bannister stood up and did it.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.576
And then what happened?

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.216
Two months later,
16 people broke the four-minute mile.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.976
The things that we have in our head
that we think are impossible

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.136
are often just milestones
waiting to be accomplished

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.780
if we can push those limits a bit.

00:07:16.804 --> 00:07:20.176
And I think this starts with probably
your physical body and fitness

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.736
more than anything,
because we can control that.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.376
If you don't think you can run a mile,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.456
you show yourself
you can run a mile or two,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.016
or a marathon, or lose five pounds,
or whatever it is,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.536
you realize that confidence compounds

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.056
and can be transferred
into the rest of your world.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.736
And I've actually gotten into the habit
of this a little bit with my friends.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.496
We have this little group.
We go on physical adventures,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.616
and recently, I found myself
in a kind of precarious spot.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.656
I'm terrified of deep, dark, blue water.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.696
I don't know if anyone's ever had
that same fear

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.319
ever since they watched
Jaws 1, 2, 3 and 4 like six times

00:07:51.344 --> 00:07:52.496
when I was a kid.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.056
But anything above here, if it's murky,
I can already feel it right now.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.856
I swear there's something in there.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.016
Even if it's Lake Tahoe,
it's fresh water, totally unfounded fear,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.696
ridiculous, but it's there.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.216
Anyway, three years ago
I find myself on this tugboat

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.216
right down here in the San Francisco Bay.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.696
It's a rainy, stormy, windy day,
and people are getting sick on the boat,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.054
and I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit,
and I'm looking out the window

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:18.056
in pure terror thinking
I'm about to swim to my death.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.336
I'm going to try to swim
across the Golden Gate.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.176
And my guess is some people in this room
might have done that before.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.416
I'm sitting there, and my buddy Jonathan,
who had talked me into it,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.696
he comes up to me
and he could see the state I was in.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.456
And he says, "Scott, hey man,
what's the worst that could happen?

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.616
You're wearing a wetsuit.
You're not going to sink.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.456
And If you can't make it,
just hop on one of the 20 kayaks.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.296
Plus, if there's a shark attack,
why are they going to pick you

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.940
over the 80 people in the water?"
So thanks, that helps.

00:08:42.964 --> 00:08:45.820
He's like, "But really,
just have fun with this. Good luck."

00:08:45.844 --> 00:08:48.336
And he dives in, swims off. OK.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.736
Turns out, the pep talk totally worked,
and I felt this total feeling of calm,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.696
and I think it was because
Jonathan was 13 years old.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.656
(Laughter)

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.376
And of the 80 people swimming that day,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.216
65 of them were between
the ages of nine and 13.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.976
Think how you would have approached
your world differently

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.176
if at nine years old you found out
you could swim a mile and a half

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.896
in 56-degree water
from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.336
What would you have said yes to?

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.216
What would you have not given up on?
What would you have tried?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.336
As I'm finishing this swim,
I get to Aquatic Park,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.736
and I'm getting out of the water

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.856
and of course half the kids
are already finished,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.214
so they're cheering me on
and they're all excited.

00:09:24.238 --> 00:09:27.254
And I got total popsicle head,
if anyone's ever swam in the Bay,

00:09:27.278 --> 00:09:30.776
and I'm trying to just thaw my face out,
and I'm watching people finish.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.826
And I see this one kid,
something didn't look right.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.856
And he's just flailing like this.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.296
And he's barely able to sip some air
before he slams his head back down.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.536
And I notice other parents
were watching too,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.016
and I swear they were thinking
the same thing I was:

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.976
this is why you don't let nine-year-olds
swim from Alcatraz.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.216
This was not fatigue.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.536
All of a sudden, two parents
run up and grab him,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.336
and they put him on their shoulders,
and they're dragging him like this,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.216
totally limp.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.576
And then all of a sudden
they walk a few more feet

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.576
and they plop him down in his wheelchair.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.136
And he puts his fists up in the most
insane show of victory I've ever seen.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.816
I can still feel the warmth
and the energy on this guy

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.416
when he made this accomplishment.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.416
I had seen him earlier that day
in his wheelchair.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.416
I just had no idea he was going to swim.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.536
I mean, where is he
going to be in 20 years?

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.976
How many people told him he couldn't
do that, that he would die if he tried that?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.136
You prove people wrong,
you prove yourself wrong,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.976
that you can make
little incremental pushes

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.536
of what you believe is possible.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.976
You don't have to be
the fastest marathoner in the world,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.381
just your own impossibilities,
to accomplish those,

00:10:31.405 --> 00:10:33.381
and it starts with little bitty steps.

00:10:33.405 --> 00:10:35.736
And the best way to do this

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.976
is to surround yourself
with passionate people.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.762
The fastest things to do things
you don't think can be done

00:10:40.786 --> 00:10:43.358
is to surround yourself
with people already doing them.

00:10:43.382 --> 00:10:45.816
There's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.216
"You are the average of the five people
you spend the most time with."

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.536
And there is no bigger lifehack
in the history of the world

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.616
from getting where you are today
to where you want to be

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.536
than the people you choose
to put in your corner.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.856
They change everything,
and it's a proven fact.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.176
In 1898, Norman Triplett did this study
with a bunch of cyclists,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.000
and he would measure their times
around the track in a group,

00:11:08.025 --> 00:11:09.176
and also individually.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.896
And he found that every time the cyclists
in the group would cycle faster.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.736
And it's been repeated
in all kinds of walks of life since then,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.656
and it proves the same thing over again,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.536
that the people around you matter,
and environment is everything.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.136
But it's on you to control it,
because it can go both ways.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.736
With 80 percent of people
who don't like the work they do,

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.936
that means most people around us,
not in this room, but everywhere else,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.616
are encouraging complacency and keeping us
from pursuing the things that matter to us

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.696
so we have to manage those surroundings.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.720
I found myself in this situation --

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.576
personal example, a couple years ago.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.776
Has anyone ever had a hobby or a passion
they poured their heart and soul into,

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.296
unbelievable amount of time, and they
so badly want to call it a business,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.456
but no one's paying attention
and it doesn't make a dime?

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.576
OK, I was there for four years trying
to build this Live Your Legend movement

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.936
to help people do work that they genuinely
cared about and that inspired them,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.296
and I was doing all I could,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.496
and there were only
three people paying attention,

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.759
and they're all right there:
my mother, father and my wife, Chelsea.

00:12:07.783 --> 00:12:09.279
Thank you guys for the support.

00:12:09.303 --> 00:12:10.776
(Applause)

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.496
And this is how badly I wanted it,
it grew at zero percent for four years,

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.496
and I was about to shut it down,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.216
and right about then,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.776
I moved to San Francisco and started
to meet some pretty interesting people

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.016
who had these crazy
lifestyles of adventure,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.056
of businesses and websites and blogs

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.336
that surrounded their passions
and helped people in a meaningful way.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.016
And one of my friends,
now, he has a family of eight,

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.376
and he supports his whole family

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.256
with a blog that he
writes for twice a week.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.328
They just came back from a month
in Europe, all of them together.

00:12:41.352 --> 00:12:43.416
This blew my mind.
How does this even exist?

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.936
And I got unbelievably inspired
by seeing this,

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.936
and instead of shutting it down,
I decided, let's take it seriously.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.936
And I did everything I could
to spend my time,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.456
every waking hour possible
trying to hound these guys,

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.256
hanging out and having beers
and workouts, whatever it was.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.016
And after four years of zero growth,

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.376
within six months
of hanging around these people,

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.096
the community at Live Your Legend
grew by 10 times.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.976
In another 12 months,
it grew by 160 times.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.056
And today over 30,000 people
from 158 countries

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.176
use our career and connection tools
on a monthly basis.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.576
And those people have made up
that community of passionate folks

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.816
who inspired that possibility
that I dreamed of

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.016
for Live Your Legend so many years back.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.296
The people change everything,
and this is why --

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.536
you know, you ask what was going on.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.016
Well, for four years,
I knew nobody in this space,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.536
and I didn't even know it existed,
that people could do this stuff,

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.536
that you could have movements like this.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.216
And then I'm over here in San Francisco,
and everyone around me was doing it.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.336
It became normal, so my thinking went
from how could I possibly do this

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.176
to how could I possibly not.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.416
And right then, when that happens,
that switch goes on in your head,

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.107
it ripples across your whole world.

00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:54.056
And without even trying,
your standards go from here to here.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.795
You don't need to change your goals.
You just need to change your surroundings.

00:13:57.819 --> 00:14:02.176
That's it, and that's why I love
being around this whole group of people,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.820
why I go to every TED event I can,

00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:06.776
and watch them on my iPad
on the way to work, whatever it is.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.216
Because this is the group of people
that inspires possibility.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.256
We have a whole day
to spend together and plenty more.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.736
To sum things up,
in terms of these three pillars,

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.696
they all have one thing in common
more than anything else.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.176
They are 100 percent in our control.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.256
No one can tell you
you can't learn about yourself.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.423
No one can tell you
you can't push your limits

00:14:28.447 --> 00:14:30.736
and learn your own impossible
and push that.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.696
No one can tell you you can't
surround yourself with inspiring people

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.911
or get away from the people
who bring you down.

00:14:35.935 --> 00:14:37.364
You can't control a recession.

00:14:37.388 --> 00:14:40.576
You can't control getting fired
or getting in a car accident.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.696
Most things are totally out of our hands.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.080
These three things are totally on us,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.150
and they can change our whole world
if we decide to do something about it.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.080
And the thing is, it's starting to happen
on a widespread level.

00:14:55.104 --> 00:14:58.295
I just read in Forbes, the US Government
reported for the first time

00:14:58.319 --> 00:15:01.016
in a month where more people
had quit their jobs

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.376
than had been laid off.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.616
They thought this was an anomaly,
but it's happened three months straight.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.336
In a time where people claim
it's kind of a tough environment,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.696
people are giving a middle finger
to this scripted life,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.776
the things that people
say you're supposed to do,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.536
in exchange for things that matter to them
and do the things that inspire them.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.336
And the thing is, people
are waking up to this possibility,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.336
that really the only thing that limits
possibility now is imagination.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.336
That's not a cliché anymore.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.536
I don't care what it is that you're into,
what passion, what hobby.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.016
If you're into knitting, you can find
someone who is killing it knitting,

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.376
and you can learn from them. It's wild.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.896
And that's what this whole day is about,
to learn from the folks speaking,

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.336
and we profile these people
on Live Your Legend every day,

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.056
because when ordinary people
are doing the extraordinary,

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.856
and we can be around that,

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.616
it becomes normal.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.736
And this isn't about being Gandhi
or Steve Jobs, doing something crazy.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.189
It's just about doing something
that matters to you,

00:15:56.213 --> 00:15:58.253
and makes an impact
that only you can make.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.256
Speaking of Gandhi,
he was a recovering lawyer,

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.616
as I've heard the term,

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.896
and he was called to a greater cause,
something that mattered to him,

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.136
he couldn't not do.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.399
And he has this quote
that I absolutely live by.

00:16:11.423 --> 00:16:13.736
"First they ignore you,
then they laugh at you,

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.880
then they fight you, then you win."

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.616
Everything was impossible
until somebody did it.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.816
You can either hang around the people
who tell you it can't be done

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.656
and tell you you're stupid for trying,

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.976
or surround yourself with the people
who inspire possibility,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.600
the people who are in this room.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.496
Because I see it as our responsibility
to show the world

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.936
that what's seen as impossible
can become that new normal.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.136
And that's already starting to happen.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.856
First, do the things that inspire us,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.576
so we can inspire other people
to do the things that inspire them.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.240
But we can't find that

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.256
unless we know what we're looking for.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.376
We have to do our work on ourself,

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.976
be intentional about that,
and make those discoveries.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.524
Because I imagine a world where 80 percent
of people love the work they do.

00:17:00.548 --> 00:17:01.856
What would that look like?

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.896
What would the innovation be like?
How would you treat the people around you?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.300
Things would start to change.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.016
And as we finish up,
I have just one question to ask you guys,

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.776
and I think it's the only
question that matters.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.400
And it's what is the work
you can't not do?

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.736
Discover that, live it,

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.440
not just for you,
but for everybody around you,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.256
because that is what starts
to change the world.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.600
What is the work you can't not do?

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.616
Thank you guys.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.160
(Applause)
