00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.611
Last year, I went on my first book tour.

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:07.589
In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries

00:00:07.613 --> 00:00:09.922
and gave some hundred talks.

00:00:10.462 --> 00:00:12.975
Every talk in every country

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:14.975
began with an introduction,

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.824
and every introduction began,
alas, with a lie:

00:00:20.567 --> 00:00:23.888
"Taiye Selasi comes
from Ghana and Nigeria,"

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:27.991
or "Taiye Selasi comes
from England and the States."

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.975
Whenever I heard this opening sentence,

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.564
no matter the country that concluded it --

00:00:33.588 --> 00:00:35.975
England, America, Ghana, Nigeria --

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.571
I thought, "But that's not true."

00:00:39.127 --> 00:00:43.126
Yes, I was born in England
and grew up in the United States.

00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:46.783
My mum, born in England,
and raised in Nigeria,

00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:48.791
currently lives in Ghana.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:53.040
My father was born in Gold Coast,
a British colony,

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:54.649
raised in Ghana,

00:00:54.673 --> 00:00:58.780
and has lived for over 30 years
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:03.967
For this reason, my introducers
also called me "multinational."

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:08.466
"But Nike is multinational," I thought,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.481
"I'm a human being."

00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:14.284
Then, one fine day, mid-tour,

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:17.784
I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark

00:01:17.808 --> 00:01:21.136
where I shared the stage
with the writer Colum McCann.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.470
We were discussing the role
of locality in writing,

00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:26.673
when suddenly it hit me.

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:29.142
I'm not multinational.

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.162
I'm not a national at all.

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:34.558
How could I come from a nation?

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:38.340
How can a human being come from a concept?

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:43.038
It's a question that had been bothering me
for going on two decades.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:46.576
From newspapers, textbooks, conversations,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.862
I had learned to speak of countries

00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:53.649
as if they were eternal, singular,
naturally occurring things,

00:01:53.673 --> 00:01:55.530
but I wondered:

00:01:55.554 --> 00:01:57.326
to say that I came from a country

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.365
suggested that the country
was an absolute,

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:03.071
some fixed point in place in time,

00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:05.443
a constant thing, but was it?

00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:10.817
In my lifetime, countries
had disappeared -- Czechoslovakia;

00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:15.200
appeared -- Timor-Leste;
failed -- Somalia.

00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:19.498
My parents came from countries
that didn't exist when they were born.

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:25.832
To me, a country -- this thing that could
be born, die, expand, contract --

00:02:25.856 --> 00:02:29.277
hardly seemed the basis
for understanding a human being.

00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:34.756
And so it came as a huge relief
to discover the sovereign state.

00:02:35.232 --> 00:02:37.170
What we call countries are actually

00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:39.843
various expressions
of sovereign statehood,

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:43.731
an idea that came into fashion
only 400 years ago.

00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:49.181
When I learned this, beginning my
masters degree in international relations,

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:51.574
I felt a sort of surge of relief.

00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:53.844
It was as I had suspected.

00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:58.023
History was real, cultures were real,

00:02:58.047 --> 00:03:00.561
but countries were invented.

00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:05.483
For the next 10 years, I sought
to re- or un-define myself,

00:03:05.507 --> 00:03:07.975
my world, my work, my experience,

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.174
beyond the logic of the state.

00:03:10.198 --> 00:03:14.737
In 2005, I wrote an essay,
"What is an Afropolitan,"

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:20.029
sketching out an identity
that privileged culture over country.

00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:24.572
It was thrilling how many people
could relate to my experience,

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:29.573
and instructional how many others
didn't buy my sense of self.

00:03:30.224 --> 00:03:35.224
"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana,"
one such critic asked,

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.516
"when she's never known the indignities

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.253
of traveling abroad
on a Ghanian passport?"

00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:42.975
Now, if I'm honest,

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.431
I knew just what she meant.

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.448
I've got a friend named Layla
who was born and raised in Ghana.

00:03:48.472 --> 00:03:53.014
Her parents are third-generation
Ghanians of Lebanese descent.

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:58.506
Layla, who speaks fluent Twi,
knows Accra like the back of her hand,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.265
but when we first met years ago,
I thought, "She's not from Ghana."

00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:06.235
In my mind, she came from Lebanon,

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.975
despite the patent fact
that all her formative experience

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.844
took place in suburban Accra.

00:04:12.376 --> 00:04:14.718
I, like my critics,

00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:20.272
was imagining some Ghana
where all Ghanaians had brown skin

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:22.807
or none held U.K. passports.

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.426
I'd fallen into the limiting trap

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.621
that the language of coming
from countries sets --

00:04:28.645 --> 00:04:32.376
the privileging of a fiction,
the singular country,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.609
over reality: human experience.

00:04:36.363 --> 00:04:41.029
Speaking with Colum McCann that day,
the penny finally dropped.

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:44.177
"All experience is local," he said.

00:04:44.788 --> 00:04:48.391
"All identity is experience," I thought.

00:04:48.836 --> 00:04:52.297
"I'm not a national,"
I proclaimed onstage.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.510
"I'm a local. I'm multi-local."

00:04:55.876 --> 00:05:00.023
See, "Taiye Selasi comes
from the United States," isn't the truth.

00:05:00.452 --> 00:05:03.229
I have no relationship
with the United States,

00:05:03.253 --> 00:05:05.418
all 50 of them, not really.

00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:09.614
My relationship is with Brookline,
the town where I grew up;

00:05:09.638 --> 00:05:12.179
with New York City, where I started work;

00:05:12.203 --> 00:05:14.987
with Lawrenceville,
where I spend Thanksgiving.

00:05:15.797 --> 00:05:21.037
What makes America home for me
is not my passport or accent,

00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:23.697
but these very particular experiences

00:05:23.721 --> 00:05:25.679
and the places they occur.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.807
Despite my pride in Ewe culture,

00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:31.975
the Black Stars,
and my love of Ghanaian food,

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:36.357
I've never had a relationship
with the Republic of Ghana, writ large.

00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:40.393
My relationship is with Accra,
where my mother lives,

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:42.028
where I go each year,

00:05:42.052 --> 00:05:46.448
with the little garden in Dzorwulu
where my father and I talk for hours.

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:50.171
These are the places
that shape my experience.

00:05:50.607 --> 00:05:52.956
My experience is where I'm from.

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:57.378
What if we asked, instead
of "Where are you from?" --

00:05:57.782 --> 00:05:59.586
"Where are you a local?"

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.023
This would tell us so much more
about who and how similar we are.

00:06:04.047 --> 00:06:08.631
Tell me you're from France,
and I see what, a set of clichés?

00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:12.895
Adichie's dangerous single story,
the myth of the nation of France?

00:06:13.355 --> 00:06:16.589
Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris,

00:06:16.613 --> 00:06:20.978
better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see
a set of experiences.

00:06:21.002 --> 00:06:23.975
Our experience is where we're from.

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:26.046
So, where are you a local?

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.141
I propose a three-step test.

00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:34.262
I call these the three "R’s":
rituals, relationships, restrictions.

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:38.533
First, think of your daily rituals,
whatever they may be:

00:06:38.557 --> 00:06:40.590
making your coffee, driving to work,

00:06:40.614 --> 00:06:43.490
harvesting your crops,
saying your prayers.

00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:45.736
What kind of rituals are these?

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.213
Where do they occur?

00:06:47.237 --> 00:06:51.876
In what city or cities in the world
do shopkeepers know your face?

00:06:52.582 --> 00:06:56.975
As a child, I carried out fairly standard
suburban rituals in Boston,

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:01.630
with adjustments made for the rituals
my mother brought from London and Lagos.

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:03.501
We took off our shoes in the house,

00:07:03.525 --> 00:07:06.215
we were unfailingly
polite with our elders,

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:08.476
we ate slow-cooked, spicy food.

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:13.561
In snowy North America,
ours were rituals of the global South.

00:07:14.132 --> 00:07:17.975
The first time I went to Delhi
or to southern parts of Italy,

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:20.335
I was shocked by how at home I felt.

00:07:20.359 --> 00:07:22.490
The rituals were familiar.

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:25.078
"R" number one, rituals.

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:29.692
Now, think of your relationships,
of the people who shape your days.

00:07:30.065 --> 00:07:32.605
To whom do you speak at least once a week,

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:35.429
be it face to face or on FaceTime?

00:07:35.453 --> 00:07:37.159
Be reasonable in your assessment;

00:07:37.183 --> 00:07:40.040
I'm not talking about
your Facebook friends.

00:07:40.064 --> 00:07:44.347
I'm speaking of the people who shape
your weekly emotional experience.

00:07:44.371 --> 00:07:46.975
My mother in Accra,
my twin sister in Boston,

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:49.041
my best friends in New York:

00:07:49.065 --> 00:07:51.410
these relationships are home for me.

00:07:51.822 --> 00:07:54.109
"R" number two, relationships.

00:07:54.665 --> 00:07:58.975
We're local where we carry out
our rituals and relationships,

00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:01.741
but how we experience our locality

00:08:01.765 --> 00:08:05.051
depends in part on our restrictions.

00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:07.918
By restrictions, I mean,
where are you able to live?

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:09.975
What passport do you hold?

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:15.266
Are you restricted by, say, racism,
from feeling fully at home where you live?

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.553
By civil war, dysfunctional governance,
economic inflation,

00:08:19.577 --> 00:08:23.975
from living in the locality
where you had your rituals as a child?

00:08:24.396 --> 00:08:26.993
This is the least sexy of the R’s,

00:08:27.017 --> 00:08:29.975
less lyric than rituals and relationships,

00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:33.309
but the question takes us past
"Where are you now?"

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:36.357
to "Why aren't you there, and why?"

00:08:37.174 --> 00:08:40.011
Rituals, relationships, restrictions.

00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:42.028
Take a piece of paper

00:08:42.052 --> 00:08:45.344
and put those three words
on top of three columns,

00:08:45.368 --> 00:08:48.684
then try to fill those columns
as honestly as you can.

00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:53.202
A very different picture
of your life in local context,

00:08:53.226 --> 00:08:56.640
of your identity as a set of experiences,

00:08:56.664 --> 00:08:57.824
may emerge.

00:08:57.848 --> 00:08:59.064
So let's try it.

00:08:59.088 --> 00:09:00.853
I have a friend named Olu.

00:09:00.877 --> 00:09:02.472
He's 35 years old.

00:09:02.496 --> 00:09:06.441
His parents, born in Nigeria,
came to Germany on scholarships.

00:09:06.465 --> 00:09:10.026
Olu was born in Nuremberg
and lived there until age 10.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.843
When his family moved to Lagos,
he studied in London,

00:09:12.867 --> 00:09:14.292
then came to Berlin.

00:09:14.316 --> 00:09:16.975
He loves going to Nigeria --

00:09:16.999 --> 00:09:19.633
the weather, the food, the friends --

00:09:19.657 --> 00:09:22.171
but hates the political corruption there.

00:09:22.655 --> 00:09:23.855
Where is Olu from?

00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:26.617
I have another friend named Udo.

00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:28.148
He's also 35 years old.

00:09:28.624 --> 00:09:31.823
Udo was born in Córdoba,
in northwest Argentina,

00:09:31.847 --> 00:09:35.035
where his grandparents migrated
from Germany, what is now Poland,

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:36.487
after the war.

00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:40.393
Udo studied in Buenos Aires,
and nine years ago came to Berlin.

00:09:40.417 --> 00:09:44.618
He loves going to Argentina -- 
the weather, the food, the friends --

00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:47.102
but hates the economic corruption there.

00:09:47.467 --> 00:09:49.405
Where is Udo from?

00:09:49.429 --> 00:09:53.062
With his blonde hair and blue eyes,
Udo could pass for German,

00:09:53.086 --> 00:09:57.142
but holds an Argentinian passport,
so needs a visa to live in Berlin.

00:09:57.166 --> 00:10:01.475
That Udo is from Argentina
has largely to do with history.

00:10:01.499 --> 00:10:04.656
That he's a local
of Buenos Aires and Berlin,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.465
that has to do with life.

00:10:06.774 --> 00:10:10.975
Olu, who looks Nigerian,
needs a visa to visit Nigeria.

00:10:10.999 --> 00:10:13.390
He speaks Yoruba with an English accent,

00:10:13.414 --> 00:10:15.493
and English with a German one.

00:10:15.517 --> 00:10:18.058
To claim that he's
"not really Nigerian," though,

00:10:18.082 --> 00:10:20.410
denies his experience in Lagos,

00:10:20.434 --> 00:10:22.617
the rituals he practiced growing up,

00:10:22.641 --> 00:10:25.070
his relationship with family and friends.

00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:29.452
Meanwhile, though Lagos
is undoubtedly one of his homes,

00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:31.975
Olu always feels restricted there,

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:34.268
not least by the fact that he's gay.

00:10:35.228 --> 00:10:38.950
Both he and Udo are restricted
by the political conditions

00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:40.628
of their parents' countries,

00:10:40.652 --> 00:10:43.636
from living where some of their
most meaningful rituals

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.610
and relationships occur.

00:10:45.634 --> 00:10:49.735
To say Olu is from Nigeria
and Udo is from Argentina

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:51.872
distracts from their common experience.

00:10:51.896 --> 00:10:55.511
Their rituals, their relationships,
and their restrictions are the same.

00:10:56.146 --> 00:10:58.560
Of course, when we ask,
"Where are you from?"

00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:00.505
we're using a kind of shorthand.

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:04.456
It's quicker to say "Nigeria"
than "Lagos and Berlin,"

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:08.747
and as with Google Maps,
we can always zoom in closer,

00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:11.231
from country to city to neighborhood.

00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:13.548
But that's not quite the point.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.899
The difference between
"Where are you from?"

00:11:16.923 --> 00:11:18.439
and "Where are you a local?"

00:11:18.463 --> 00:11:21.425
isn't the specificity of the answer;

00:11:21.449 --> 00:11:23.564
it's the intention of the question.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.181
Replacing the language of nationality
with the language of locality asks us

00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:32.897
to shift our focus
to where real life occurs.

00:11:33.349 --> 00:11:37.566
Even that most glorious expression
of countryhood, the World Cup,

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:43.286
gives us national teams comprised
mostly of multilocal players.

00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:46.176
As a unit of measurement
for human experience,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.975
the country doesn't quite work.

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:52.852
That's why Olu says, "I'm German,
but my parents come from Nigeria."

00:11:53.249 --> 00:11:58.605
The "but" in that sentence
belies the inflexibility of the units,

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:02.767
one fixed and fictional entity
bumping up against another.

00:12:03.164 --> 00:12:07.586
"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin,"
suggests overlapping experiences,

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.835
layers that merge together,
that can't be denied or removed.

00:12:12.176 --> 00:12:14.408
You can take away my passport,

00:12:14.432 --> 00:12:16.539
but you can't take away my experience.

00:12:16.563 --> 00:12:18.674
That I carry within me.

00:12:18.698 --> 00:12:21.340
Where I'm from comes wherever I go.

00:12:22.253 --> 00:12:25.620
To be clear, I'm not suggesting
that we do away with countries.

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:27.778
There's much to be said
for national history,

00:12:27.803 --> 00:12:29.764
more for the sovereign state.

00:12:29.788 --> 00:12:34.485
Culture exists in community,
and community exists in context.

00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:38.475
Geography, tradition, collective memory:
these things are important.

00:12:39.006 --> 00:12:41.514
What I'm questioning is primacy.

00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:46.663
All of those introductions on tour
began with reference to nation,

00:12:46.687 --> 00:12:51.010
as if knowing what country I came
from would tell my audience who I was.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.415
What are we really seeking, though,
when we ask where someone comes from?

00:12:55.439 --> 00:12:58.380
And what are we really seeing
when we hear an answer?

00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:00.270
Here's one possibility:

00:13:00.294 --> 00:13:03.064
basically, countries represent power.

00:13:03.588 --> 00:13:08.163
"Where are you from?"
Mexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power.

00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:12.165
America. Germany. Japan. More power.

00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:15.076
China. Russia. Ambiguous.

00:13:15.703 --> 00:13:17.363
(Laughter)

00:13:17.387 --> 00:13:21.048
It's possible that without realizing it,
we're playing a power game,

00:13:21.072 --> 00:13:24.413
especially in the context
of multi-ethnic countries.

00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:26.706
As any recent immigrant knows,

00:13:26.731 --> 00:13:30.975
the question "Where are you from?"
or "Where are you really from?"

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:33.468
is often code for "Why are you here?"

00:13:34.324 --> 00:13:37.436
Then we have the scholar
William Deresiewicz's writing

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.233
of elite American colleges.

00:13:39.257 --> 00:13:42.408
"Students think that
their environment is diverse

00:13:42.432 --> 00:13:45.687
if one comes from Missouri
and another from Pakistan --

00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:49.749
never mind that all of their parents
are doctors or bankers."

00:13:50.114 --> 00:13:51.273
I'm with him.

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:54.768
To call one student American,
another Pakistani,

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:58.053
then triumphantly claim
student body diversity

00:13:58.077 --> 00:14:01.720
ignores the fact that these students
are locals of the same milieu.

00:14:01.744 --> 00:14:05.093
The same holds true on the other end
of the economic spectrum.

00:14:05.593 --> 00:14:10.265
A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles
and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi

00:14:10.289 --> 00:14:14.112
have more in common
in terms of rituals and restrictions

00:14:14.136 --> 00:14:15.922
than nationality implies.

00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:19.541
Perhaps my biggest problem
with coming from countries

00:14:19.565 --> 00:14:21.279
is the myth of going back to them.

00:14:21.303 --> 00:14:24.398
I'm often asked if I plan
to "go back" to Ghana.

00:14:24.422 --> 00:14:28.742
I go to Accra every year,
but I can't "go back" to Ghana.

00:14:28.766 --> 00:14:30.567
It's not because I wasn't born there.

00:14:30.591 --> 00:14:32.924
My father can't go back, either.

00:14:32.948 --> 00:14:34.975
The country in which he was born,

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:37.333
that country no longer exists.

00:14:37.357 --> 00:14:41.192
We can never go back to a place
and find it exactly where we left it.

00:14:41.216 --> 00:14:44.064
Something, somewhere
will always have changed,

00:14:44.088 --> 00:14:45.984
most of all, ourselves.

00:14:46.738 --> 00:14:47.960
People.

00:14:47.985 --> 00:14:50.532
Finally, what we're talking
about is human experience,

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:54.419
this notoriously and gloriously
disorderly affair.

00:14:54.888 --> 00:14:58.286
In creative writing,
locality bespeaks humanity.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.587
The more we know
about where a story is set,

00:15:00.611 --> 00:15:02.975
the more local color and texture,

00:15:02.999 --> 00:15:05.476
the more human
the characters start to feel,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.776
the more relatable, not less.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.244
The myth of national identity
and the vocabulary of coming from

00:15:12.268 --> 00:15:17.230
confuses us into placing ourselves
into mutually exclusive categories.

00:15:17.254 --> 00:15:21.559
In fact, all of us are multi --
multi-local, multi-layered.

00:15:21.583 --> 00:15:25.367
To begin our conversations
with an acknowledgement of this complexity

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:28.972
brings us closer together, I think,
not further apart.

00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:32.298
So the next time that I'm introduced,

00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:34.171
I'd love to hear the truth:

00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:38.202
"Taiye Selasi is a human being,
like everybody here.

00:15:38.226 --> 00:15:42.284
She isn't a citizen of the world,
but a citizen of worlds.

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:45.069
She is a local of New York,
Rome and Accra."

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:46.572
Thank you.

00:15:46.596 --> 00:15:50.999
(Applause)
