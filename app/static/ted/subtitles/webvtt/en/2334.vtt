WEBVTT

00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:02.714
So I've had the great privilege

00:00:02.738 --> 00:00:05.154
of traveling to some incredible places,

00:00:05.178 --> 00:00:09.412
photographing these distant landscapes
and remote cultures

00:00:09.436 --> 00:00:10.862
all over the world.

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:12.296
I love my job.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.885
But people think it's
this string of epiphanies

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.398
and sunrises and rainbows,

00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:20.186
when in reality, it looks
more something like this.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.432
(Laughter)

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:22.981
This is my office.

00:00:23.473 --> 00:00:26.104
We can't afford the fanciest places
to stay at night,

00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:28.966
so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors.

00:00:29.365 --> 00:00:30.794
As long as we can stay dry,

00:00:30.818 --> 00:00:32.219
that's a bonus.

00:00:32.243 --> 00:00:34.648
We also can't afford
the fanciest restaurants.

00:00:34.672 --> 00:00:37.592
So we tend to eat
whatever's on the local menu.

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:41.117
And if you're in the Ecuadorian PÃ¡ramo,

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.903
you're going to eat
a large rodent called a cuy.

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:45.544
(Laughter)

00:00:45.568 --> 00:00:49.186
But what makes our experiences
perhaps a little bit different

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.932
and a little more unique
than that of the average person

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:55.412
is that we have this gnawing thing
in the back of our mind

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:59.353
that even in our darkest moments,
and those times of despair,

00:00:59.377 --> 00:01:03.279
we think, "Hey, there might be
an image to be made here,

00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:05.426
there might be a story to be told."

00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:08.081
And why is storytelling important?

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.039
Well, it helps us to connect with our
cultural and our natural heritage.

00:01:13.063 --> 00:01:14.222
And in the Southeast,

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:17.304
there's an alarming disconnect
between the public

00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:21.051
and the natural areas that allow
us to be here in the first place.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.975
We're visual creatures,

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:27.351
so we use what we see
to teach us what we know.

00:01:27.773 --> 00:01:30.171
Now the majority of us
aren't going to willingly go

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:31.847
way down to a swamp.

00:01:32.638 --> 00:01:36.232
So how can we still expect
those same people to then advocate

00:01:36.256 --> 00:01:37.974
on behalf of their protection?

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.584
We can't.

00:01:39.608 --> 00:01:43.853
So my job, then, is to use photography
as a communication tool,

00:01:43.877 --> 00:01:47.852
to help bridge the gap
between the science and the aesthetics,

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:49.494
to get people talking,

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:50.887
to get them thinking,

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:52.568
and to hopefully, ultimately,

00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:53.983
get them caring.

00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.751
I started doing this 15 years ago
right here in Gainesville,

00:01:57.775 --> 00:01:59.650
right here in my backyard.

00:01:59.674 --> 00:02:02.522
And I fell in love
with adventure and discovery,

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:04.603
going to explore
all these different places

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:06.920
that were just minutes
from my front doorstep.

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:09.532
There are a lot
of beautiful places to find.

00:02:09.872 --> 00:02:12.174
Despite all these years that have passed,

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.492
I still see the world
through the eyes of a child

00:02:14.516 --> 00:02:17.369
and I try to incorporate
that sense of wonderment

00:02:17.393 --> 00:02:22.074
and that sense of curiosity
into my photography

00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:23.848
as often as I can.

00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.304
And we're pretty lucky
because here in the South,

00:02:27.328 --> 00:02:30.400
we're still blessed
with a relatively blank canvas

00:02:30.424 --> 00:02:33.608
that we can fill with the most
fanciful adventures

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:36.079
and incredible experiences.

00:02:36.103 --> 00:02:40.047
It's just a matter of how far
our imagination will take us.

00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:42.601
See, a lot of people
look at this and they say,

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:44.403
"Oh yeah, wow, that's a pretty tree."

00:02:44.427 --> 00:02:45.898
But I don't just see a tree --

00:02:45.922 --> 00:02:48.501
I look at this and I see opportunity.

00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:50.122
I see an entire weekend.

00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:53.759
Because when I was a kid,
these were the types of images

00:02:53.783 --> 00:02:56.251
that got me off the sofa
and dared me to explore,

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:57.716
dared me to go find the woods

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.635
and put my head underwater
and see what we have.

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:04.234
And folks, I've been photographing
all over the world

00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:05.599
and I promise you,

00:03:05.623 --> 00:03:07.118
what we have here in the South,

00:03:07.142 --> 00:03:08.823
what we have in the Sunshine State,

00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:11.142
rivals anything else that I've seen.

00:03:11.943 --> 00:03:15.955
But yet our tourism industry is busy
promoting all the wrong things.

00:03:16.698 --> 00:03:19.429
Before most kids are 12,
they'll have been to Disney World

00:03:19.453 --> 00:03:21.414
more times than they've been in a canoe

00:03:21.438 --> 00:03:24.280
or camping under a starry sky.

00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:28.363
And I have nothing against Disney
or Mickey; I used to go there, too.

00:03:28.387 --> 00:03:31.046
But they're missing out on those
fundamental connections

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.292
that create a real sense
of pride and ownership

00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:36.419
for the place that they call home.

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:40.290
And this is compounded by the issue
that the landscapes

00:03:40.314 --> 00:03:42.423
that define our natural heritage

00:03:42.447 --> 00:03:45.423
and fuel our aquifer
for our drinking water

00:03:45.447 --> 00:03:49.890
have been deemed as scary
and dangerous and spooky.

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.082
When our ancestors first came here,

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:54.742
they warned, "Stay out
of these areas, they're haunted.

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:57.863
They're full of evil spirits and ghosts."

00:03:57.887 --> 00:04:00.233
I don't know where
they came up with that idea.

00:04:00.804 --> 00:04:03.436
But it's actually led
to a very real disconnect,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.221
a very real negative mentality

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.823
that has kept the public
disinterested, silent,

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:11.412
and ultimately, our environment at risk.

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:15.975
We're a state that's surrounded
and defined by water,

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:17.275
and yet for centuries,

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.192
swamps and wetlands have been regarded

00:04:19.216 --> 00:04:21.923
as these obstacles to overcome.

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:26.349
And so we've treated them
as these second-class ecosystems,

00:04:26.373 --> 00:04:28.637
because they have
very little monetary value

00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:32.346
and of course, they're known
to harbor alligators and snakes --

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.668
which, I'll admit, these aren't
the most cuddly of ambassadors.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:36.828
(Laughter)

00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:39.630
So it became assumed, then,
that the only good swamp

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:40.972
was a drained swamp.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.515
And in fact,

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.950
draining a swamp to make way
for agriculture and development

00:04:45.974 --> 00:04:49.887
was considered the very essence
of conservation not too long ago.

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:52.068
But now we're backpedaling,

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:55.443
because the more we come to learn
about these sodden landscapes,

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:57.433
the more secrets we're starting to unlock

00:04:57.457 --> 00:04:59.820
about interspecies relationships

00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:04.394
and the connectivity of habitats,
watersheds and flyways.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.025
Take this bird, for example:

00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:08.937
this is the prothonotary warbler.

00:05:08.961 --> 00:05:11.147
I love this bird because
it's a swamp bird,

00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:12.875
through and through, a swamp bird.

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:16.547
They nest and they mate and they breed
in these old-growth swamps

00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:18.035
in these flooded forests.

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:20.607
And so after the spring,
after they raise their young,

00:05:20.631 --> 00:05:23.436
they then fly thousand of miles
over the Gulf of Mexico

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.409
into Central and South America.

00:05:25.806 --> 00:05:27.058
And then after the winter,

00:05:27.082 --> 00:05:29.097
the spring rolls around
and they come back.

00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:32.020
They fly thousands of miles
over the Gulf of Mexico.

00:05:32.044 --> 00:05:34.950
And where do they go? Where do they land?

00:05:35.474 --> 00:05:37.990
Right back in the same tree.

00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:39.836
That's nuts.

00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:43.498
This is a bird the size
of a tennis ball --

00:05:43.522 --> 00:05:45.199
I mean, that's crazy!

00:05:45.223 --> 00:05:47.773
I used a GPS to get here today,

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:49.464
and this is my hometown.

00:05:49.488 --> 00:05:50.759
(Laughter)

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:51.940
It's crazy.

00:05:52.374 --> 00:05:56.064
So what happens, then, when this bird
flies over the Gulf of Mexico

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:57.956
into Central America for the winter

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.421
and then the spring rolls around
and it flies back,

00:06:00.445 --> 00:06:03.212
and it comes back to this:

00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:05.130
a freshly sodded golf course?

00:06:05.942 --> 00:06:08.531
This is a narrative that's
all too commonly unraveling

00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:09.742
here in this state.

00:06:09.766 --> 00:06:13.005
And this is a natural process
that's occurred for thousands of years

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:14.807
and we're just now learning about it.

00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:17.994
So you can imagine all else we have
to learn about these landscapes

00:06:18.018 --> 00:06:19.876
if we just preserve them first.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.431
Now despite all this rich life
that abounds in these swamps,

00:06:24.455 --> 00:06:26.279
they still have a bad name.

00:06:26.828 --> 00:06:30.494
Many people feel uncomfortable
with the idea of wading

00:06:30.518 --> 00:06:32.182
into Florida's blackwater.

00:06:32.206 --> 00:06:33.995
I can understand that.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.160
But what I loved about growing up
in the Sunshine State

00:06:37.184 --> 00:06:38.466
is that for so many of us,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.279
we live with this latent
but very palpable fear

00:06:42.303 --> 00:06:44.644
that when we put our toes into the water,

00:06:44.668 --> 00:06:47.650
there might be something much more ancient

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:49.811
and much more adapted than we are.

00:06:50.664 --> 00:06:55.463
Knowing that you're not top dog
is a welcomed discomfort, I think.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:59.968
How often in this modern
and urban and digital age

00:06:59.992 --> 00:07:03.636
do you actually get the chance
to feel vulnerable,

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.826
or consider that the world may not
have been made for just us?

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.132
So for the last decade,

00:07:09.156 --> 00:07:12.551
I began seeking out these areas
where the concrete yields to forest

00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:14.753
and the pines turn to cypress,

00:07:14.777 --> 00:07:18.422
and I viewed all these
mosquitoes and reptiles,

00:07:18.446 --> 00:07:19.945
all these discomforts,

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:23.501
as affirmations that I'd found
true wilderness,

00:07:23.525 --> 00:07:25.685
and I embrace them wholly.

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:29.112
Now as a conservation photographer
obsessed with blackwater,

00:07:29.136 --> 00:07:31.256
it's only fitting that I'd
eventually end up

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.457
in the most famous swamp of all:

00:07:33.481 --> 00:07:34.731
the Everglades.

00:07:35.144 --> 00:07:37.113
Growing up here in North Central Florida,

00:07:37.137 --> 00:07:38.867
it always had these enchanted names,

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:42.233
places like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee,

00:07:42.257 --> 00:07:44.379
Corkscrew, Big Cypress.

00:07:44.403 --> 00:07:47.943
I started what turned
into a five-year project

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.717
to hopefully reintroduce
the Everglades in a new light,

00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:53.422
in a more inspired light.

00:07:53.922 --> 00:07:57.147
But I knew this would be a tall order,
because here you have an area

00:07:57.171 --> 00:08:00.200
that's roughly a third the size
the state of Florida, it's huge.

00:08:00.224 --> 00:08:01.501
And when I say Everglades,

00:08:01.525 --> 00:08:03.993
most people are like,
"Oh, yeah, the national park."

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:09.030
But the Everglades is not just a park;
it's an entire watershed,

00:08:09.054 --> 00:08:12.059
starting with the Kissimmee
chain of lakes in the north,

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:14.308
and then as the rains
would fall in the summer,

00:08:14.332 --> 00:08:16.964
these downpours would flow
into Lake Okeechobee,

00:08:16.988 --> 00:08:20.235
and Lake Okeechobee would fill up
and it would overflow its banks

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:23.533
and spill southward, ever slowly,
with the topography,

00:08:23.557 --> 00:08:26.153
and get into the river of grass,
the Sawgrass Prairies,

00:08:26.177 --> 00:08:28.222
before meting into the cypress slews,

00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:30.933
until going further south
into the mangrove swamps,

00:08:30.957 --> 00:08:34.707
and then finally -- finally --
reaching Florida Bay,

00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:36.504
the emerald gem of the Everglades,

00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:37.711
the great estuary,

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:39.988
the 850 square-mile estuary.

00:08:40.464 --> 00:08:44.797
So sure, the national park
is the southern end of this system,

00:08:44.821 --> 00:08:48.124
but all the things that make it unique
are these inputs that come in,

00:08:48.148 --> 00:08:50.955
the fresh water that starts
100 miles north.

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:54.244
So no manner of these political
or invisible boundaries

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:58.655
protect the park from polluted water
or insufficient water.

00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:02.068
And unfortunately, that's precisely
what we've done.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.163
Over the last 60 years,

00:09:04.187 --> 00:09:07.544
we have drained, we have dammed,
we have dredged the Everglades

00:09:07.568 --> 00:09:11.549
to where now only one third of the water
that used to reach the bay

00:09:11.573 --> 00:09:13.580
now reaches the bay today.

00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:18.254
So this story is not all sunshine
and rainbows, unfortunately.

00:09:18.953 --> 00:09:20.839
For better or for worse,

00:09:20.863 --> 00:09:24.280
the story of the Everglades
is intrinsically tied

00:09:24.304 --> 00:09:27.500
to the peaks and the valleys
of mankind's relationship

00:09:27.524 --> 00:09:28.864
with the natural world.

00:09:29.255 --> 00:09:31.280
But I'll show you
these beautiful pictures,

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:32.765
because it gets you on board.

00:09:32.789 --> 00:09:35.917
And while I have your attention,
I can tell you the real story.

00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:37.892
It's that we're taking this,

00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:40.879
and we're trading it for this,

00:09:40.903 --> 00:09:42.398
at an alarming rate.

00:09:43.358 --> 00:09:45.068
And what's lost on so many people

00:09:45.092 --> 00:09:47.603
is the sheer scale
of which we're discussing.

00:09:47.627 --> 00:09:51.055
Because the Everglades is not just
responsible for the drinking water

00:09:51.079 --> 00:09:53.283
for 7 million Floridians;

00:09:53.307 --> 00:09:55.845
today it also provides
the agricultural fields

00:09:55.869 --> 00:09:58.428
for the year-round tomatoes and oranges

00:09:58.452 --> 00:10:01.283
for over 300 million Americans.

00:10:02.391 --> 00:10:05.705
And it's that same seasonal pulse
of water in the summer

00:10:05.729 --> 00:10:09.622
that built the river of grass
6,000 years ago.

00:10:10.284 --> 00:10:14.662
Ironically, today, it's also responsible
for the over half a million acres

00:10:14.686 --> 00:10:17.141
of the endless river of sugarcane.

00:10:17.899 --> 00:10:20.068
These are the same fields
that are responsible

00:10:20.092 --> 00:10:24.116
for dumping exceedingly high levels
of fertilizers into the watershed,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.303
forever changing the system.

00:10:26.749 --> 00:10:29.961
But in order for you to not just
understand how this system works,

00:10:29.985 --> 00:10:32.048
but to also get personally
connected to it,

00:10:32.072 --> 00:10:35.347
I decided to break the story down
into several different narratives.

00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:38.159
And I wanted that story to start
in Lake Okeechobee,

00:10:38.183 --> 00:10:40.930
the beating heart of the Everglade system.

00:10:40.954 --> 00:10:43.417
And to do that, I picked an ambassador,

00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:44.690
an iconic species.

00:10:45.204 --> 00:10:47.196
This is the Everglade snail kite.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.966
It's a great bird,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.864
and they used to nest in the thousands,

00:10:50.888 --> 00:10:52.691
thousands in the northern Everglades.

00:10:52.715 --> 00:10:56.219
And then they've gone down
to about 400 nesting pairs today.

00:10:56.243 --> 00:10:57.588
And why is that?

00:10:57.612 --> 00:11:00.736
Well, it's because they eat
one source of food, an apple snail,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.161
about the size of a ping-pong ball,
an aquatic gastropod.

00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:07.410
So as we started damming up
the Everglades,

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:10.911
as we started diking Lake Okeechobee
and draining the wetlands,

00:11:10.935 --> 00:11:13.047
we lost the habitat for the snail.

00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:15.863
And thus, the population
of the kites declined.

00:11:16.454 --> 00:11:19.950
And so, I wanted a photo that would
not only communicate this relationship

00:11:19.974 --> 00:11:23.063
between wetland, snail and bird,

00:11:23.087 --> 00:11:25.336
but I also wanted a photo
that would communicate

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.154
how incredible this relationship was,

00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:32.334
and how very important it is
that they've come to depend on each other,

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.025
this healthy wetland and this bird.

00:11:34.049 --> 00:11:36.021
And to do that, I brainstormed this idea.

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:39.283
I started sketching
out these plans to make a photo,

00:11:39.307 --> 00:11:42.194
and I sent it to the wildlife biologist
down in Okeechobee --

00:11:42.218 --> 00:11:45.305
this is an endangered bird,
so it takes special permission to do.

00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:47.023
So I built this submerged platform

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:49.529
that would hold snails
just right under the water.

00:11:49.553 --> 00:11:54.011
And I spent months planning
this crazy idea.

00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:57.011
And I took this platform
down to Lake Okeechobee

00:11:57.035 --> 00:11:59.107
and I spent over a week in the water,

00:11:59.131 --> 00:12:02.847
wading waist-deep,
9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk,

00:12:02.871 --> 00:12:06.031
to get one image that I thought
might communicate this.

00:12:06.055 --> 00:12:08.270
And here's the day that it finally worked:

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:11.151
[Video: (Mac Stone narrating)
After setting up the platform,

00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:13.712
I look off and I see a kite
coming over the cattails.

00:12:13.736 --> 00:12:15.658
And I see him scanning and searching.

00:12:15.682 --> 00:12:17.287
And he gets right over the trap,

00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:18.832
and I see that he's seen it.

00:12:18.856 --> 00:12:21.579
And he beelines,
he goes straight for the trap.

00:12:21.603 --> 00:12:24.759
And in that moment,
all those months of planning, waiting,

00:12:24.783 --> 00:12:26.893
all the sunburn, mosquito bites --

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:29.455
suddenly, they're all worth it.

00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:33.394
(Mac Stone in film) Oh my gosh,
I can't believe it!]

00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:36.292
You can believe how excited I was
when that happened.

00:12:36.316 --> 00:12:37.656
But what the idea was,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.879
is that for someone
who's never seen this bird

00:12:39.903 --> 00:12:41.973
and has no reason to care about it,

00:12:41.997 --> 00:12:44.622
these photos, these new perspectives,

00:12:44.646 --> 00:12:47.768
will help shed a little new light
on just one species

00:12:47.792 --> 00:12:52.074
that makes this watershed
so incredible, so valuable, so important.

00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:55.538
Now, I know I can't come
here to Gainesville

00:12:55.562 --> 00:12:57.808
and talk to you about animals
in the Everglades

00:12:57.832 --> 00:12:59.620
without talking about gators.

00:12:59.644 --> 00:13:01.934
I love gators, I grew up loving gators.

00:13:02.361 --> 00:13:05.777
My parents always said I had
an unhealthy relationship with gators.

00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:07.269
But what I like about them is,

00:13:07.293 --> 00:13:09.897
they're like the freshwater
equivalent of sharks.

00:13:09.921 --> 00:13:11.569
They're feared, they're hated,

00:13:11.593 --> 00:13:13.957
and they are tragically misunderstood.

00:13:14.386 --> 00:13:18.150
Because these are a unique species,
they're not just apex predators.

00:13:18.174 --> 00:13:19.464
In the Everglades,

00:13:19.488 --> 00:13:21.982
they are the very architects
of the Everglades,

00:13:22.006 --> 00:13:24.149
because as the water drops
down in the winter

00:13:24.173 --> 00:13:25.331
during the dry season,

00:13:25.355 --> 00:13:28.377
they start excavating these holes
called gator holes.

00:13:28.401 --> 00:13:30.711
And they do this because
as the water drops down,

00:13:30.735 --> 00:13:34.122
they'll be able to stay wet
and they'll be able to forage.

00:13:34.645 --> 00:13:36.964
And now this isn't just affecting them,

00:13:36.988 --> 00:13:39.221
other animals also depend
on this relationship,

00:13:39.245 --> 00:13:41.923
so they become a keystone species as well.

00:13:42.677 --> 00:13:46.912
So how do you make an apex predator,
an ancient reptile,

00:13:46.936 --> 00:13:49.414
at once look like it dominates the system,

00:13:49.438 --> 00:13:51.881
but at the same time, look vulnerable?

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:56.749
Well, you wade into a pit
of about 120 of them,

00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:59.179
then you hope that you've made
the right decision.

00:13:59.203 --> 00:14:00.967
(Laughter)

00:14:01.955 --> 00:14:03.915
I still have all my fingers, it's cool.

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.379
But I understand, I know
I'm not going to rally you guys,

00:14:07.403 --> 00:14:11.013
I'm not going to rally the troops to
"Save the Everglades for the gators!"

00:14:11.037 --> 00:14:13.235
It won't happen because
they're so ubiquitous,

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:14.410
we see them now,

00:14:14.434 --> 00:14:17.776
they're one of the great conservation
success stories of the US.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.126
But there is one species in the Everglades
that no matter who you are,

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.229
you can't help but love, too,
and that's the roseate spoonbill.

00:14:24.253 --> 00:14:27.884
These birds are great, but they've had
a really tough time in the Everglades,

00:14:27.908 --> 00:14:31.374
because they started out with thousands
of nesting pairs in Florida Bay,

00:14:31.398 --> 00:14:33.461
and at the turn of the 20th century,

00:14:33.485 --> 00:14:37.077
they got down to two -- two nesting pairs.

00:14:37.101 --> 00:14:38.265
And why?

00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:41.577
That's because women thought
they looked better on their hats

00:14:41.601 --> 00:14:43.614
then they did flying in the sky.

00:14:44.324 --> 00:14:46.733
Then we banned the plume trade,

00:14:46.757 --> 00:14:48.875
and their numbers started rebounding.

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:50.924
And as their numbers started rebounding,

00:14:50.948 --> 00:14:52.687
scientists began to pay attention,

00:14:52.711 --> 00:14:54.424
they started studying these birds.

00:14:54.448 --> 00:14:55.933
And what they found out is that

00:14:55.957 --> 00:14:58.115
these birds' behavior
is intrinsically tied

00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:01.057
to the annual draw-down
cycle of water in the Everglades,

00:15:01.081 --> 00:15:03.760
the thing that defines
the Everglades watershed.

00:15:04.291 --> 00:15:05.828
What they found out is that

00:15:05.852 --> 00:15:08.920
these birds started nesting in the winter
as the water drew down,

00:15:08.944 --> 00:15:12.524
because they're tactile feeders,
so they have to touch whatever they eat.

00:15:12.548 --> 00:15:15.646
And so they wait for these
concentrated pools of fish

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.067
to be able to feed enough
to feed their young.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.866
So these birds became the very icon
of the Everglades --

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.382
an indicator species
of the overall health of the system.

00:15:25.406 --> 00:15:28.613
And just as their numbers were rebounding
in the mid-20th century --

00:15:28.637 --> 00:15:33.286
shooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 --

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.066
just as that started happening, we started
draining the southern Everglades.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.594
And we stopped two-thirds
of that water from moving south.

00:15:40.618 --> 00:15:43.117
And it had drastic consequences.

00:15:43.584 --> 00:15:46.198
And just as those numbers
started reaching their peak,

00:15:46.222 --> 00:15:49.295
unfortunately, today,
the real spoonbill story,

00:15:49.319 --> 00:15:53.936
the real photo of what it looks like
is more something like this.

00:15:55.007 --> 00:15:59.623
And we're down to less than 70
nesting pairs in Florida Bay today,

00:15:59.647 --> 00:16:02.191
because we've disrupted
the system so much.

00:16:02.215 --> 00:16:05.466
So all these different organizations
are shouting, they're screaming,

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.505
"The Everglades is fragile! It's fragile!"

00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:08.680
It is not.

00:16:08.704 --> 00:16:10.254
It is resilient.

00:16:10.278 --> 00:16:13.770
Because despite all we've taken,
despite all we've done and we've drained

00:16:13.794 --> 00:16:15.633
and we've dammed and we've dredged it,

00:16:15.657 --> 00:16:18.553
pieces of it are still here,
waiting to be put back together.

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:20.831
And this is what I've loved
about South Florida,

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:24.629
that in one place, you have
this unstoppable force of mankind

00:16:24.653 --> 00:16:28.088
meeting the immovable object
of tropical nature.

00:16:28.973 --> 00:16:32.813
And it's at this new frontier
that we are forced with a new appraisal.

00:16:32.837 --> 00:16:34.520
What is wilderness worth?

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:38.213
What is the value of biodiversity,
or our drinking water?

00:16:39.195 --> 00:16:41.628
And fortunately, after decades of debate,

00:16:41.652 --> 00:16:44.619
we're finally starting to act
on those questions.

00:16:44.643 --> 00:16:47.000
We're slowly undertaking these projects

00:16:47.024 --> 00:16:49.520
to bring more freshwater back to the bay.

00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:53.199
But it's up to us as citizens,
as residents, as stewards

00:16:53.223 --> 00:16:56.178
to hold our elected officials
to their promises.

00:16:57.154 --> 00:16:58.987
What can you do to help?

00:16:59.011 --> 00:17:00.266
It's so easy.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.258
Just get outside, get out there.

00:17:02.282 --> 00:17:04.313
Take your friends out, take your kids out,

00:17:04.337 --> 00:17:05.912
take your family out.

00:17:05.936 --> 00:17:07.598
Hire a fishing guide.

00:17:07.622 --> 00:17:09.605
Show the state that protecting wilderness

00:17:09.629 --> 00:17:13.716
not only makes ecological sense,
but economic sense as well.

00:17:14.288 --> 00:17:17.615
It's a lot of fun, just do it --
put your feet in the water.

00:17:17.639 --> 00:17:20.153
The swamp will change you, I promise.

00:17:21.351 --> 00:17:23.223
Over the years, we've been so generous

00:17:23.247 --> 00:17:26.317
with these other landscapes
around the country,

00:17:26.341 --> 00:17:29.162
cloaking them with this American pride,

00:17:29.186 --> 00:17:31.557
places that we now consider to define us:

00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:34.706
Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.139
And we use these parks
and these natural areas

00:17:37.163 --> 00:17:40.406
as beacons and as cultural compasses.

00:17:41.184 --> 00:17:43.229
And sadly, the Everglades is very commonly

00:17:43.253 --> 00:17:45.169
left out of that conversation.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.108
But I believe it's every bit
as iconic and emblematic

00:17:48.132 --> 00:17:50.005
of who we are as a country

00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:52.530
as any of these other wildernesses.

00:17:52.554 --> 00:17:55.041
It's just a different kind of wild.

00:17:56.057 --> 00:17:57.384
But I'm encouraged,

00:17:57.408 --> 00:18:00.102
because maybe we're finally
starting to come around,

00:18:00.126 --> 00:18:02.713
because what was once deemed
this swampy wasteland,

00:18:02.737 --> 00:18:04.800
today is a World Heritage site.

00:18:05.404 --> 00:18:08.158
It's a wetland
of international importance.

00:18:08.699 --> 00:18:11.502
And we've come a long way
in the last 60 years.

00:18:11.526 --> 00:18:15.920
And as the world's largest and most
ambitious wetland restoration project,

00:18:15.944 --> 00:18:20.285
the international spotlight
is on us in the Sunshine State.

00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:22.042
Because if we can heal this system,

00:18:22.066 --> 00:18:25.515
it's going to become an icon
for wetland restoration

00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:26.904
all over the world.

00:18:28.236 --> 00:18:32.782
But it's up to us to decide which legacy
we want to attach our flag to.

00:18:33.508 --> 00:18:36.892
They say that the Everglades
is our greatest test.

00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:40.654
If we pass it, we get to keep the planet.

00:18:41.565 --> 00:18:42.968
I love that quote,

00:18:42.992 --> 00:18:45.025
because it's a challenge, it's a prod.

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:46.928
Can we do it? Will we do it?

00:18:46.952 --> 00:18:48.691
We have to, we must.

00:18:49.507 --> 00:18:51.472
But the Everglades is not just a test.

00:18:51.916 --> 00:18:53.535
It's also a gift,

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:56.426
and ultimately, our responsibility.

00:18:56.959 --> 00:18:58.110
Thank you.

00:18:58.134 --> 00:19:02.000
(Applause)
