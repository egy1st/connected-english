00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.216
For the last year,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.896
everyone's been watching the same show,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.136
and I'm not talking
about "Game of Thrones,"

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.096
but a horrifying, real-life drama

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.376
that's proved too fascinating to turn off.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.096
It's a show produced by murderers

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.880
and shared around the world
via the Internet.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.536
Their names have become familiar:

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.456
James Foley, Steven Sotloff,
David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.096
Haruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.816
Their beheadings by the Islamic State

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.456
were barbaric,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.400
but if we think they were archaic,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.136
from a remote, obscure age,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.816
then we're wrong.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.576
They were uniquely modern,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.456
because the murderers acted knowing well

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.160
that millions of people
would tune in to watch.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.016
The headlines called them
savages and barbarians,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.496
because the image of one man
overpowering another,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.775
killing him with a knife to the throat,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.096
conforms to our idea
of ancient, primitive practices,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.800
the polar opposite
of our urban, civilized ways.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.920
We don't do things like that.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.776
But that's the irony.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.456
We think a beheading
has nothing to do with us,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.320
even as we click on the screen to watch.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160
But it is to do with us.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.296
The Islamic State beheadings

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.016
are not ancient or remote.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.056
They're a global, 21st century event,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.016
a 21st century event that takes place
in our living rooms, at our desks,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.376
on our computer screens.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.720
They're entirely dependent
on the power of technology to connect us.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.456
And whether we like it or not,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.560
everyone who watches
is a part of the show.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.520
And lots of people watch.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.096
We don't know exactly how many.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.776
Obviously, it's difficult to calculate.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.456
But a poll taken in the UK,
for example, in August 2014,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.320
estimated that 1.2 million people

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.776
had watched the beheading of James Foley

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.440
in the few days after it was released.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.056
And that's just the first few days,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.280
and just Britain.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.096
A similar poll taken in the United States

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.840
in November 2014

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.696
found that nine percent of those surveyed

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.800
had watched beheading videos,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.776
and a further 23 percent

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.800
had watched the videos but had stopped
just before the death was shown.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.696
Nine percent may be a small minority
of all the people who could watch,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.776
but it's still a very large crowd.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.536
And of course that crowd
is growing all the time,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.696
because every week, every month,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.880
more people will keep downloading
and keep watching.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.536
If we go back 11 years,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.016
before sites like YouTube
and Facebook were born,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.776
it was a similar story.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.176
When innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.136
Nick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.776
those videos were shown
during the Iraq War.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.456
Nick Berg's beheading

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.280
quickly became one of the most
searched for items on the Internet.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.216
Within a day, it was the top search term

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.336
across search engines
like Google, Lycos, Yahoo.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.536
In the week after Nick Berg's beheading,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.800
these were the top 10 search terms
in the United States.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.776
The Berg beheading video remained
the most popular search term for a week,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.416
and it was the second most popular
search term for the whole month of May,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.160
runner-up only to "American Idol."

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.336
The al-Qaeda-linked website
that first showed Nick Berg's beheading

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.680
had to close down within a couple of days
due to overwhelming traffic to the site.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.736
One Dutch website owner said
that his daily viewing figures

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.576
rose from 300,000 to 750,000

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.560
every time a beheading in Iraq was shown.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.576
He told reporters 18 months later

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.976
that it had been downloaded
many millions of times,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.920
and that's just one website.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.256
A similar pattern was seen again and again

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.920
when videos of beheadings
were released during the Iraq War.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.896
Social media sites have made these images
more accessible than ever before,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.456
but if we take
another step back in history,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.616
we'll see that it was the camera
that first created a new kind of crowd

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.816
in our history of beheadings
as public spectacle.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.896
As soon as the camera
appeared on the scene,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.656
a full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.376
it had an immediate
and unequivocal effect.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.520
That day, the first film of a public
beheading was created in France.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.416
It was the execution, the guillotining,
of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.160
outside the prison
Saint-Pierre in Versailles.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.216
Weidmann was due to be executed
at the crack of dawn,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.416
as was customary at the time,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.016
but his executioner was new to the job,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.896
and he'd underestimated
how long it would take him to prepare.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.056
So Weidmann was executed
at 4:30 in the morning,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.456
by which time on a June morning,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.040
there was enough light
to take photographs,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.016
and a spectator in the crowd
filmed the event,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.016
unbeknownst to the authorities.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.336
Several still photographs
were taken as well,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.496
and you can still watch
the film online today

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.640
and look at the photographs.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.376
The crowd on the day
of Weidmann's execution

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.376
was called "unruly"
and "disgusting" by the press,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.576
but that was nothing compared
to the untold thousands of people

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.216
who could now study the action

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.456
over and over again,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.760
freeze-framed in every detail.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.976
The camera may have made these scenes
more accessible than ever before,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.656
but it's not just about the camera.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.096
If we take a bigger leap back in history,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.296
we'll see that for as long
as there have been

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.416
public judicial executions and beheadings,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.520
there have been the crowds to see them.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.056
In London, as late as
the early 19th century,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.736
there might be four or five thousand
people to see a standard hanging.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.080
There could be 40,000 or 50,000
to see a famous criminal killed.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.496
And a beheading, which was
a rare event in England at the time,

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.840
attracted even more.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.200
In May 1820,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.936
five men known as
the Cato Street Conspirators

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.096
were executed in London for plotting

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.720
to assassinate members
of the British government.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.096
They were hung and then decapitated.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.096
It was a gruesome scene.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.496
Each man's head was hacked off in turn
and held up to the crowd.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.696
And 100,000 people,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.336
that's 10,000 more than can fit
into Wembley Stadium,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.296
had turned out to watch.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.576
The streets were packed.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.816
People had rented out
windows and rooftops.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.856
People had climbed onto carts
and wagons in the street.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.976
People climbed lamp posts.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.800
People had been known to have died
in the crush on popular execution days.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.536
Evidence suggests
that throughout our history

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.896
of public beheadings
and public executions,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.256
the vast majority of the people
who come to see

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.480
are either enthusiastic
or, at best, unmoved.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.136
Disgust has been comparatively rare,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.376
and even when people
are disgusted and are horrified,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.440
it doesn't always stop them
from coming out all the same to watch.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.816
Perhaps the most striking example

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.135
of the human ability to watch
a beheading and remain unmoved

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.496
and even be disappointed

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.976
was the introduction in France
in 1792 of the guillotine,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.216
that famous decapitation machine.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.856
To us in the 21st century,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.376
the guillotine may seem
like a monstrous contraption,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.560
but to the first crowds who saw it,
it was actually a disappointment.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:05.416
They were used to seeing long, drawn-out,
torturous executions on the scaffold,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.896
where people were mutilated
and burned and pulled apart slowly.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.896
To them, watching
the guillotine in action,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.096
it was so quick, there was nothing to see.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.336
The blade fell, the head fell
into a basket, out of sight immediately,

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.056
and they called out,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.920
"Give me back my gallows,
give me back my wooden gallows."

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.536
The end of torturous public
judicial executions in Europe and America

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.496
was partly to do with being
more humane towards the criminal,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.256
but it was also partly because the crowd
obstinately refused to behave

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.536
in the way that they should.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.896
All too often, execution day

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.080
was more like a carnival
than a solemn ceremony.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.336
Today, a public judicial execution
in Europe or America is unthinkable,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.096
but there are other scenarios
that should make us cautious

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.176
about thinking
that things are different now

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.520
and we don't behave like that anymore.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.176
Take, for example,
the incidents of suicide baiting.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.376
This is when a crowd gathers

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.016
to watch a person who has climbed
to the top of a public building

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.456
in order to kill themselves,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.456
and people in the crowd shout and jeer,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.560
"Get on with it! Go on and jump!"

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.096
This is a well-recognized phenomenon.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:34.376
One paper in 1981 found that in 10
out of 21 threatened suicide attempts,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.256
there was incidents of suicide baiting
and jeering from a crowd.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.856
And there have been incidents
reported in the press this year.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.656
This was a very widely reported incident

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.656
in Telford and Shropshire
in March this year.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.296
And when it happens today,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.736
people take photographs
and they take videos on their phones

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.960
and they post those videos online.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.816
When it comes to brutal murderers
who post their beheading videos,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.536
the Internet has created
a new kind of crowd.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.576
Today, the action takes place
in a distant time and place,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.896
which gives the viewer a sense
of detachment from what's happening,

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.176
a sense of separation.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.936
It's nothing to do with me.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.240
It's already happened.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.936
We are also offered
an unprecedented sense of intimacy.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.656
Today, we are all offered front row seats.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.416
We can all watch in private,
in our own time and space,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.496
and no one need ever know
that we've clicked on the screen to watch.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.496
This sense of separation --

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.496
from other people,
from the event itself --

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.096
seems to be key to understanding
our ability to watch,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.376
and there are several ways

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.656
in which the Internet
creates a sense of detachment

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.280
that seems to erode
individual moral responsibility.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.376
Our activities online
are often contrasted with real life,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.480
as though the things we do online
are somehow less real.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.256
We feel less accountable for our actions

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.616
when we interact online.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.736
There's a sense of anonymity,
a sense of invisibility,

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.400
so we feel less accountable
for our behavior.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.416
The Internet also makes it far easier
to stumble upon things inadvertently,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.056
things that we would usually avoid
in everyday life.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.936
Today, a video can start playing
before you even know what you're watching.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.976
Or you may be tempted to look at material
that you wouldn't look at in everyday life

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.120
or you wouldn't look at if you
were with other people at the time.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.016
And when the action is pre-recorded

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.256
and takes place
in a distant time and space,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.256
watching seems like a passive activity.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.090
There's nothing I can do about it now.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.670
It's already happened.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.456
All these things make it easier
as an Internet user

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.296
for us to give in to our sense
of curiosity about death,

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.016
to push our personal boundaries,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.960
to test our sense of shock,
to explore our sense of shock.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.696
But we're not passive when we watch.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.216
On the contrary, we're fulfilling
the murderer's desire to be seen.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.696
When the victim of a decapitation
is bound and defenseless,

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.200
he or she essentially becomes
a pawn in their killer's show.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.376
Unlike a trophy head
that's taken in battle,

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.720
that represents the luck and skill
it takes to win a fight,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.336
when a beheading is staged,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.296
when it's essentially a piece of theater,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.800
the power comes from the reception
the killer receives as he performs.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.616
In other words, watching
is very much part of the event.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.176
The event no longer takes place
in a single location

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.360
at a certain point in time as it used to
and as it may still appear to.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.136
Now the event is stretched out
in time and place,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.120
and everyone who watches plays their part.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.400
We should stop watching,

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.680
but we know we won't.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.896
History tells us we won't,

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.520
and the killers know it too.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.456
Thank you.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.976
(Applause)

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.896
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
Let me get this back. Thank you.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.816
Let's move here. While they install
for the next performance,

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.696
I want to ask you the question
that probably many here have,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.320
which is how did you
get interested in this topic?

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.376
Frances Larson: I used to work at a museum

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.336
called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford,

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.216
which was famous for its display
of shrunken heads from South America.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.176
People used to say, "Oh, the shrunken head
museum, the shrunken head museum!"

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.816
And at the time,
I was working on the history

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.856
of scientific collections of skulls.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.456
I was working on the cranial collections,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.296
and it just struck me as ironic

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.096
that here were people coming to see
this gory, primitive, savage culture

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.640
that they were almost
fantasizing about and creating

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.341
without really understanding
what they were seeing,

00:15:12.365 --> 00:15:15.936
and all the while these vast --
I mean hundreds of thousands

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.096
of skulls in our museums,
all across Europe and the States --

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.376
were kind of upholding this Enlightenment
pursuit of scientific rationality.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.456
So I wanted to kind of twist it round
and say, "Let's look at us."

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.376
We're looking through the glass case
at these shrunken heads.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.936
Let's look at our own history and our own
cultural fascination with these things.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.777
BG: Thank you for sharing that.

00:15:39.802 --> 00:15:40.976
FL: Thank you.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.080
(Applause)
