00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:03.261
When I was only three or four,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:05.753
I fell in love with poetry,

00:00:05.777 --> 00:00:08.888
with the rhythms
and the music of language;

00:00:08.912 --> 00:00:12.555
with the power of metaphor and of imagery,

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.341
poetry being the essence
of communication --

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:18.072
the discipline, the distillation.

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.961
And all these years later,
the poems I'll read today

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:25.286
are from my just-finished
seventh book of poetry.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.326
Well, five years ago, I was diagnosed
with Parkinson's disease.

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:32.794
Though there's no cure yet,

00:00:32.818 --> 00:00:35.604
advances in treatment
are really impressive.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:38.975
But you can imagine
that I was appalled to learn

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:43.493
that women are largely
left out of research trials,

00:00:43.517 --> 00:00:47.038
despite gender-specific
medical findings having demonstrated

00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:49.721
that we are not actually just small men --

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:51.842
(Laughter)

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:55.118
who happen to have
different reproductive systems.

00:00:55.142 --> 00:00:57.971
Gender-specific medicine
is good for men, too.

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:03.078
But you bring to a crisis
the person you already are,

00:01:03.102 --> 00:01:06.975
including the, yes, momentum
that you've learned to invoke

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:10.308
through passionate caring
and through action,

00:01:10.332 --> 00:01:14.700
both of which require
but also create energy.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.756
So as an activist, I began working
with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation --

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.961
that's pdf.org --

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:28.724
to create a major initiative to put women
on the Parkinson's disease map.

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.044
And as a poet, I began working
with this subject matter,

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:37.792
finding it tragic, hilarious,
sometimes even joyful.

00:01:38.136 --> 00:01:40.723
I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's;

00:01:40.747 --> 00:01:43.372
I feel distilled by it,

00:01:43.396 --> 00:01:47.834
and I actually very much
like the woman I'm distilling into.

00:01:49.528 --> 00:01:51.429
"No Signs of Struggle"

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.619
Growing small requires enormity of will:

00:01:56.643 --> 00:01:59.231
just sitting still
in the doctor's waiting room

00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:02.841
watching the future shuffle in and out,

00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:05.608
watching it stoop; stare at you

00:02:05.632 --> 00:02:07.594
while you try not to look.

00:02:08.213 --> 00:02:09.856
Rare is an exchange:

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.023
a smile of brief, wry recognition.

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:15.716
You are the new kid on the block.

00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:18.352
Everyone here was you once.

00:02:18.791 --> 00:02:22.998
You are still learning that growing small
requires a largeness of spirit

00:02:23.022 --> 00:02:25.481
you can't fit into yet:

00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:29.454
acceptance of irritating help
from those who love you;

00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:32.562
giving way and over, but not up.

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:36.722
You've swallowed hard the contents
of the "Drink Me" bottle,

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:38.931
and felt yourself shrink.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.319
Now, familiar furniture looms,

00:02:42.343 --> 00:02:47.129
floors tilt, and doorknobs yield only
when wrestled round with both hands.

00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:52.555
It demands colossal patience,
all this growing small:

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.475
your diminished sleep at night,

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.928
your handwriting, your voice, your height.

00:02:58.668 --> 00:03:01.893
You are more the incredible
shrinking woman

00:03:01.917 --> 00:03:05.840
than the Buddhist mystic,
serene, making do with less.

00:03:05.864 --> 00:03:08.645
Less is not always more.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.140
Yet in this emptying space,
space glimmers,

00:03:14.164 --> 00:03:15.798
becoming visible.

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:19.474
Here is a place behind the eyes
of those accustomed

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:22.767
by what some would call diminishment.

00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:27.143
It is a place of merciless poetry,

00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:30.486
a gift of presence previously ignored,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.579
drowned in the daily clutter.

00:03:33.357 --> 00:03:36.438
Here every gesture needs intention,

00:03:36.462 --> 00:03:38.468
is alive with consciousness.

00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:40.346
Nothing is automatic.

00:03:41.192 --> 00:03:44.661
You can spot it
in the provocation of a button,

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:46.898
an arm poking at a sleeve,

00:03:46.922 --> 00:03:51.271
a balancing act at a night-time curb
while negotiating the dark.

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:55.167
Feats of such modest valor,

00:03:55.191 --> 00:04:00.495
who would suspect them to be exercises
in an intimate, fierce discipline,

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.820
a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware?

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:07.452
Such understated power here,

00:04:07.476 --> 00:04:11.764
in these tottering dancers
who exert stupendous effort

00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:14.874
on tasks most view as insignificant.

00:04:15.572 --> 00:04:18.913
Such quiet beauty here, in these,

00:04:18.937 --> 00:04:23.210
my soft-voiced, stiff-limbed people;

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:26.932
such resolve masked by each placid face.

00:04:27.937 --> 00:04:32.530
There is immensity required
in growing small,

00:04:32.554 --> 00:04:35.565
so bent on such unbending grace.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.319
(Applause)

00:04:42.343 --> 00:04:43.921
Thank you.

00:04:43.945 --> 00:04:47.128
This one is called
"On Donating My Brain to Science."

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:48.344
(Laughter)

00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:50.254
Not a problem.

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.862
Skip over all the pages
reassuring religious people.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.036
Already a universal donor:
kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.282
tissue, heart, veins, whatever.

00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:07.575
Odd that the modest brain never
imagined its unique value in research,

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.913
maybe saving someone else from what it is
they're not quite sure I have.

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:13.170
Flattering, that.

00:05:13.673 --> 00:05:15.818
So fill in the forms,

00:05:15.842 --> 00:05:17.701
drill through the answers,

00:05:17.725 --> 00:05:19.688
trill out a blithe spirit.

00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:24.000
And slice me, dice me,
spread me on your slides.

00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:26.666
Find what I'm trying to tell you.

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:31.991
Earn me, learn me, scan me,
squint through your lens.

00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:34.694
Uncover what I'd hint at if I could.

00:05:34.718 --> 00:05:39.182
Be my guest, do your best,
harvest me, track the clues.

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:41.680
This was a good brain while alive.

00:05:41.704 --> 00:05:44.060
This was a brain that paid its dues.

00:05:44.084 --> 00:05:48.975
So slice me, dice me,
smear me on your slides,

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.520
stain me, explain me, drain me like a cup.

00:05:52.544 --> 00:05:54.620
Share me, hear me:

00:05:54.644 --> 00:05:57.244
I want to be used
I want to be used

00:05:57.268 --> 00:05:59.314
I want to be used
up.

00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:02.933
(Applause)

00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:09.260
(Applause ends)

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.531
And this one's called "The Ghost Light."

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.779
Lit from within is the sole secure way

00:06:17.803 --> 00:06:19.797
to traverse dark matter.

00:06:20.424 --> 00:06:25.421
Some life forms -- certain mushrooms,
snails, jellyfish, worms --

00:06:25.445 --> 00:06:27.717
glow bioluminescent,

00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:29.510
and people as well;

00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:33.786
we emit infra-red light
from our most lucent selves.

00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:37.602
Our tragedy is we can't see it.

00:06:38.406 --> 00:06:40.258
We see by reflecting.

00:06:40.972 --> 00:06:44.701
We need biofluorescence
to show our true colors.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.503
External illumination can distort, though.

00:06:48.527 --> 00:06:50.529
When gravity bends light,

00:06:50.553 --> 00:06:54.162
huge galaxy clusters
can act as telescopes,

00:06:54.186 --> 00:06:59.363
elongating background images
of star systems to faint arcs --

00:06:59.387 --> 00:07:00.541
a lensing effect

00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:04.508
like viewing distant street lamps
through a glass of wine.

00:07:05.535 --> 00:07:08.242
A glass of wine or two now makes me weave

00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:11.128
as if acting the drunkard's part;

00:07:11.152 --> 00:07:14.498
as if, besotted with unrequited love

00:07:14.522 --> 00:07:18.607
for the dynamic Turner canvasses
spied out by the Hubble,

00:07:18.631 --> 00:07:20.912
I could lurch down a city street set

00:07:20.936 --> 00:07:24.855
without provoking
every pedestrian walk-on stare.

00:07:25.924 --> 00:07:27.924
Stare as long as you need to.

00:07:28.442 --> 00:07:33.841
If you think about it, walking,
even standing, is illogical --

00:07:33.865 --> 00:07:35.841
such tiny things, feet! --

00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:37.782
(Laughter)

00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:41.717
especially when one's body
is not al dente anymore.

00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:45.327
(Laughter)

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:48.851
Besides, creature of extremes and excess,

00:07:48.875 --> 00:07:51.911
I've always thought Apollo
beautiful but boring,

00:07:51.935 --> 00:07:53.919
and a bit of a dumb blonde.

00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:57.748
Dionysians don't do balance.

00:07:58.923 --> 00:08:02.574
Balance, in other words,
has never been my strong point.

00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:04.272
But I digress.

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:05.511
More and more these days,

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:08.533
digression seems
the most direct route through

00:08:08.557 --> 00:08:10.634
from where I've lost or found myself

00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:14.349
out of place, mind, turn, time.

00:08:15.222 --> 00:08:19.558
Place your foot just so,
mind how you turn:

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:22.359
too swift a swivel can bring you down.

00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:26.134
Take your time ushering the audience out,

00:08:26.158 --> 00:08:28.190
saying goodbye to the actors.

00:08:29.048 --> 00:08:30.199
The ghost light

00:08:30.223 --> 00:08:32.009
is what they call the single bulb

00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:35.634
hanging above the bare stage
in an empty theater.

00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:38.968
In the empty theater of such a night,

00:08:38.992 --> 00:08:42.810
waking to meet no external radiance,

00:08:42.834 --> 00:08:46.026
this is the final struggle left to win,

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.285
this the sole beacon
to beckon the darkness in

00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:51.954
and let the rest begin,

00:08:51.978 --> 00:08:56.931
this the lens through which at last
to see both Self and Other

00:08:56.955 --> 00:09:01.575
arrayed with the bright stain
of original sin:

00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:03.051
lit from within.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:11.825
(Applause)

00:09:12.725 --> 00:09:14.107
And this is the last one.

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:16.103
"This Dark Hour"

00:09:17.513 --> 00:09:20.028
Late summer, 4 A.M.

00:09:20.674 --> 00:09:23.020
The rain slows to a stop,

00:09:23.044 --> 00:09:25.292
dripping still from the broad leaves

00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:28.503
of blue hostas unseen
in the garden's dark.

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:32.953
Barefoot, careful
on the slick slate slabs,

00:09:32.977 --> 00:09:36.260
I need no light, I know the way,

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.163
stoop by the mint bed,

00:09:38.187 --> 00:09:40.992
scoop a fistful of moist earth,

00:09:41.016 --> 00:09:42.724
then grope for a chair,

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:45.402
spread a shawl, and sit,

00:09:45.426 --> 00:09:49.184
breathing in the wet green August air.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.230
This is the small, still hour

00:09:53.254 --> 00:09:57.068
before the newspaper
lands in the vestibule like a grenade,

00:09:57.092 --> 00:10:01.663
the phone shrills, the computer screen
blinks and glares awake.

00:10:02.643 --> 00:10:04.823
There is this hour:

00:10:04.847 --> 00:10:08.823
poem in my head, soil in my hand:

00:10:08.847 --> 00:10:10.793
unnamable fullness.

00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:14.245
This hour, when blood of my blood

00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:18.301
bone of bone, child grown
to manhood now --

00:10:18.325 --> 00:10:23.789
stranger, intimate,
not distant but apart --

00:10:23.813 --> 00:10:27.547
lies safe, off dreaming melodies

00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:31.100
while love sleeps, safe, in his arms.

00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:34.340
To have come to this place,

00:10:34.364 --> 00:10:36.455
lived to this moment:

00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:38.594
immeasurable lightness.

00:10:39.392 --> 00:10:42.313
The density of black starts to blur umber.

00:10:42.789 --> 00:10:45.767
Tentative, a cardinal's coloratura,

00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:47.802
then the mourning dove's elegy.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.780
Sable glimmers toward grey;

00:10:50.804 --> 00:10:53.972
objects emerge, trailing shadows;

00:10:53.996 --> 00:10:55.971
night ages toward day.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.006
The city stirs.

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.858
There will be other dawns,
nights, gaudy noons.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.417
Likely, I'll lose my way.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.272
There will be stumbling, falling,

00:11:08.296 --> 00:11:09.537
cursing the dark.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.110
Whatever comes,

00:11:12.134 --> 00:11:16.081
there was this hour when nothing mattered,

00:11:16.105 --> 00:11:18.786
all was unbearably dear.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.116
And when I'm done with daylights,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:27.101
should those who loved me
grieve too long a while,

00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:30.354
let them remember that I had this hour --

00:11:30.378 --> 00:11:33.986
this dark, perfect hour --

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.412
and smile.

00:11:36.418 --> 00:11:37.572
Thank you.

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:43.948
(Applause)
