00:00:01.346 --> 00:00:04.975
(Arabic) I seek refuge in Allah from cursed Satan.
In the Name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful.

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.809
(English) I was born
in a middle class family.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:12.479
My father was five years old
when he lost his father,

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.312
but by the time I was born,

00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:18.161
he was already a businessman.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.748
But it didn't make a difference to him

00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:24.680
if his children were going to be
a boy or a girl:

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:26.307
they were going to go to school.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.291
So I guess I was the lucky one.

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:32.934
My mother had 16 pregnancies.

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:38.489
From 16 pregnancies, five of us are alive.

00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:43.292
You can imagine as a child
what I went through.

00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:46.857
Day to day, I watched women

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.627
being carried to a graveyard,

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:54.131
or watched children going to a graveyard.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.579
At that time, when I
finished my high school,

00:00:58.603 --> 00:01:00.982
I really wanted to be a doctor.

00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:05.220
I wanted to be a doctor
to help women and children.

00:01:06.053 --> 00:01:08.498
So I completed my education,

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:10.942
but I wanted to go to university.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.974
Unfortunately, in my country,
there wasn't a dormitory for girls,

00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:20.987
so I was accepted in medical school,
but I could not go there.

00:01:21.606 --> 00:01:26.297
So as a result, my father
sent me to America.

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:28.908
I came to America.

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:30.982
I completed my education.

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:33.775
While I was completing my education,

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.926
my country was invaded by Russia.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.382
And do you know that at the time
I was completing my education,

00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:46.144
I didn't know what was going on
with my family or with my country.

00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:49.565
There were months, years,
I didn't know about it.

00:01:50.358 --> 00:01:53.360
My family was in a refugee camp.

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.225
So as soon as I completed my education,

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:00.829
I brought my family to America.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.626
I wanted them to be safe.

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:05.808
But where was my heart?

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.197
My heart was in Afghanistan.

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:11.776
Day after day,
when I listened to the news,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.474
when I followed what was
going on with my country,

00:02:14.498 --> 00:02:16.069
my heart was breaking up.

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:18.641
I really wanted to go back to my country,

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:21.783
but at the same time I knew
I could not go there,

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:24.196
because there was no place for me.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.347
I had a good job.

00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:28.656
I was a professor at a university.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.482
I earned good money.

00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:32.172
I had a good life.

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:33.983
My family was here.

00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:35.998
I could live with them.

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.880
But I wasn't happy.

00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:39.625
I wanted to go back home.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.174
So I went to the refugee camp.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:46.102
And when I went
to the refugee camp in Pakistan,

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:49.031
there were 7.5 million refugees.

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:52.176
7.5 million refugees.

00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:56.993
About 90 percent of them
were women and children.

00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:01.088
Most of the men have been killed
or they were in war.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.317
And you know, in the refugee camp,

00:03:04.698 --> 00:03:07.182
when I went day-to-day to do a survey,

00:03:07.674 --> 00:03:11.381
I found things you never could imagine.

00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:14.849
I saw a widow with five to eight children

00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:17.094
sitting there and weeping

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:18.991
and not knowing what to do.

00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:22.769
I saw a young woman
have no way to go anywhere,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.951
no education, no entertainment,
no place to even live.

00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:33.514
I saw young men that had lost
their father and their home,

00:03:33.538 --> 00:03:38.431
and they are supporting the family
as a 10-to-12-year old boy --

00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:40.145
being the head of the household,

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.360
trying to protect their sister
and their mother and their children.

00:03:44.113 --> 00:03:47.152
So it was a very devastating situation.

00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:50.104
My heart was beating for my people,

00:03:50.128 --> 00:03:51.795
and I didn't know what to do.

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:55.144
At that moment, we talk about momentum.

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:59.436
At that moment, I felt,
what can I do for these people?

00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:01.604
How could I help these people?

00:04:01.628 --> 00:04:04.666
I am one individual.
What can I do for them?

00:04:05.205 --> 00:04:07.848
But at that moment, I knew

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.419
that education changed my life.

00:04:10.745 --> 00:04:14.459
It transformed me. It gave me status.

00:04:14.483 --> 00:04:18.114
It gave me confidence.
It gave me a career.

00:04:18.138 --> 00:04:20.352
It helped me to support my family,

00:04:20.376 --> 00:04:22.831
to bring my family to another country,

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:24.019
to be safe.

00:04:24.853 --> 00:04:27.590
And I knew that at that moment

00:04:27.614 --> 00:04:31.622
that what I should give to my people
is education and health,

00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:33.519
and that's what I went after.

00:04:33.942 --> 00:04:36.283
But do you think it was easy?

00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:43.227
No, because at that time, education
was banned for girls, completely.

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:48.034
And also, by Russia invading Afghanistan,

00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:50.241
people were not trusting anyone.

00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:54.780
It was very hard to come and say,
"I want to do this."

00:04:54.804 --> 00:04:56.225
Who am I?

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:58.375
Somebody who comes from the United States.

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.297
Somebody who got educated here.

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:02.995
Did they trust me? Of course not.

00:05:03.622 --> 00:05:07.936
So I really needed to build
the trust in this community.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.801
How am I going to do that?

00:05:10.372 --> 00:05:13.269
I went and surveyed and looked and looked.

00:05:13.626 --> 00:05:14.935
I asked.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.221
Finally, I found one man.

00:05:17.674 --> 00:05:19.110
He was 80 years old.

00:05:19.412 --> 00:05:20.824
He was a mullah.

00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:24.070
I went to his tent in the camp,

00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:26.046
and I asked him,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.165
"I want to make you a teacher."

00:05:29.117 --> 00:05:30.768
And he looked at me,

00:05:30.792 --> 00:05:32.165
and he said, "Crazy woman,

00:05:33.157 --> 00:05:37.165
crazy woman, how do you think
I can be a teacher?"

00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:40.395
And I told him,
"I will make you a teacher."

00:05:40.705 --> 00:05:42.848
Finally, he accepted my offer,

00:05:43.554 --> 00:05:46.356
and once I started a class
in his compound,

00:05:46.935 --> 00:05:48.848
the word spread all over.

00:05:49.657 --> 00:05:51.799
In a matter of one year,

00:05:51.823 --> 00:05:54.744
we had 25 schools set up,

00:05:54.768 --> 00:05:57.712
15,000 children going to school,

00:05:57.736 --> 00:05:59.832
and it was amazing.

00:05:59.856 --> 00:06:02.093
(Applause)

00:06:02.117 --> 00:06:03.268
Thank you.

00:06:04.236 --> 00:06:05.387
Thank you.

00:06:06.252 --> 00:06:11.794
But of course, we're doing all our work,
we were giving teacher training.

00:06:11.818 --> 00:06:16.587
We were training women's rights,
human rights, democracy, rule of law.

00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:19.040
We were giving all kinds of training.

00:06:19.064 --> 00:06:21.540
And one day, I tell you,

00:06:22.087 --> 00:06:25.746
one day I was in the office
in Peshawar, Pakistan.

00:06:26.556 --> 00:06:31.466
All of a sudden, I saw my staff
running to rooms and locking the doors

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.443
and telling me, "Run away, hide!"

00:06:35.268 --> 00:06:37.776
And you know, as a leader, what do you do?

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.293
You're scared. You know it's dangerous.

00:06:42.317 --> 00:06:44.087
You know your life is on the line.

00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:46.896
But as a leader,
you have to hold it together.

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:50.007
You have to hold it together
and show strength.

00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:52.618
So I said, "What's going on?"

00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:55.507
And these people were pouring
into my office.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.539
So I invited them to the office.

00:06:57.563 --> 00:07:02.174
They came, and there were
nine of them -- nine Taliban.

00:07:02.753 --> 00:07:05.475
They were the ugliest looking men
you can ever see.

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:07.540
(Laughter)

00:07:07.564 --> 00:07:09.562
Very mean-looking people,

00:07:09.586 --> 00:07:11.833
black clothes, black turban,

00:07:11.857 --> 00:07:13.593
and they pour into my office.

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:17.339
And I invited them
to have a seat and have tea.

00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:20.133
They said no. They are not
going to drink tea.

00:07:20.934 --> 00:07:24.386
And of course, with the tone
of voice they were using,

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.806
it was very scary,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.417
but I was really shaking up.

00:07:28.441 --> 00:07:32.020
But also I was strong, holding myself up.

00:07:32.424 --> 00:07:35.354
And, of course, by that time,
you know how I dress --

00:07:35.378 --> 00:07:37.949
I dress from head to toe in a black hijab.

00:07:37.973 --> 00:07:40.456
The only thing you could see, my eyes.

00:07:41.464 --> 00:07:43.918
They asked me, "What are you doing?

00:07:43.942 --> 00:07:47.347
Don't you know that school
is banned for girls?

00:07:47.776 --> 00:07:49.514
What are you doing here?"

00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:52.523
And you know, I just looked at them,

00:07:52.547 --> 00:07:55.142
and I said, "What school?
Where is the school?"

00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:58.308
(Laughter)

00:07:58.332 --> 00:08:01.428
(Applause)

00:08:01.452 --> 00:08:05.213
And they look at my face, and they said,
"You are teaching girls here."

00:08:05.237 --> 00:08:08.071
I said, "This is a house of somebody.

00:08:08.428 --> 00:08:10.332
We have some students coming,

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:13.308
and they are all learning
Koran, Holy Book.

00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:18.062
And you know, Koran says that
if you learn the Holy Book, the woman,

00:08:18.086 --> 00:08:20.339
they can be a good wife,

00:08:20.363 --> 00:08:22.403
and they can obey their husband."

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:26.912
(Laughter)

00:08:26.936 --> 00:08:28.753
And I tell you one thing:

00:08:28.777 --> 00:08:31.500
that's the way you work with those people,
and you know --

00:08:31.524 --> 00:08:32.975
(Laughter)

00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:37.022
So by that time,
they started speaking Pashto.

00:08:37.046 --> 00:08:38.975
They talked to each other,

00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:41.689
and they said, "Let's go,
leave her alone, she's OK."

00:08:42.904 --> 00:08:46.808
And you know, this time,
I offered them tea again,

00:08:46.832 --> 00:08:49.490
and they took a sip and they left.

00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:54.268
By that time, my staff
poured into my office.

00:08:54.292 --> 00:08:56.307
They were scared to death.

00:08:56.331 --> 00:08:58.402
They didn't know why they didn't kill me.

00:08:58.426 --> 00:09:00.863
They didn't know why
they didn't take me away.

00:09:00.887 --> 00:09:03.625
But everybody was happy to see me.

00:09:04.164 --> 00:09:07.157
Very happy, and I was happy
to be alive, of course.

00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:08.332
(Laughter)

00:09:08.356 --> 00:09:10.370
Of course, I was happy to be alive.

00:09:10.394 --> 00:09:16.270
But also, as we continuously gave
training during the fall of the Taliban --

00:09:16.294 --> 00:09:18.731
of course during the Taliban
there is another story.

00:09:18.755 --> 00:09:22.914
We went underground and we provided
education for 80 schoolgirls,

00:09:22.938 --> 00:09:26.461
3,000 students underground,
and continuously we trained.

00:09:26.802 --> 00:09:29.719
With the fall of the Taliban,
we went into the country,

00:09:29.743 --> 00:09:32.203
and we opened school after school.

00:09:32.227 --> 00:09:34.632
We opened women's learning center.

00:09:34.656 --> 00:09:36.592
We continuously opened clinics.

00:09:36.616 --> 00:09:38.600
We worked with mothers and children.

00:09:38.624 --> 00:09:40.347
We had reproductive health training.

00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:43.187
We had all kinds of training
that you can imagine.

00:09:43.489 --> 00:09:47.758
I was very happy. I was delighted
with the outcome of my work.

00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:51.414
And one day, with four trainers
and one bodyguard,

00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:54.207
I was going up north of Kabul,

00:09:54.692 --> 00:09:56.612
and all of a sudden, again,

00:09:57.239 --> 00:09:59.517
I was stopped in the middle of the road

00:09:59.541 --> 00:10:01.432
by 19 young men.

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:04.479
Rifles on their shoulders,
they blocked the road.

00:10:05.646 --> 00:10:08.551
And I told my driver, "What's going on?"

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:10.298
And the driver said, "I don't know."

00:10:10.322 --> 00:10:13.091
He asked them. They said,
"We have nothing to do with you."

00:10:13.115 --> 00:10:16.122
They called my name.
They said, "We want her."

00:10:16.828 --> 00:10:19.731
My bodyguard got out, said,
"I can answer you.

00:10:19.755 --> 00:10:21.049
What do you want?"

00:10:21.073 --> 00:10:23.080
They said, "Nothing." They called my name.

00:10:23.104 --> 00:10:27.975
And by that time, the women
are yelling and screaming inside the car.

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:30.554
I am very shaken up,
and I told myself, this is it.

00:10:30.578 --> 00:10:33.095
This time, we all are going to be killed.

00:10:33.119 --> 00:10:35.419
There is no doubt in my mind.

00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:40.633
But still, the moment comes,
and you take strength

00:10:40.657 --> 00:10:43.531
from whatever you believe
and whatever you do.

00:10:43.555 --> 00:10:44.920
It's in your heart.

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:47.819
You believe in your worth,
and you can walk on it.

00:10:47.843 --> 00:10:51.382
So I just hold myself
on the side of the car.

00:10:51.406 --> 00:10:54.961
My leg was shaking, and I got outside.

00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:57.485
And I asked them, "What can I do for you?"

00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:59.096
You know what they said to me?

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.262
They said, "We know who you are.

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:04.208
We know where you are going.

00:11:04.232 --> 00:11:06.913
Every day you go up north here and there.

00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:09.985
You train women, you teach them

00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:13.056
and also you give them an
opportunity to have a job.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.880
You build their skills. How about us?"

00:11:15.904 --> 00:11:18.755
(Laughter)

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:21.747
(Applause)

00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:26.135
"And you know, how about us?

00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:27.745
What are we going to do?"

00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:30.141
I looked at them, and I said,
"I don't know."

00:11:30.165 --> 00:11:32.983
(Laughter)

00:11:33.007 --> 00:11:34.578
They said, "It's OK.

00:11:34.602 --> 00:11:36.762
The only thing we can do, what we know,

00:11:36.786 --> 00:11:39.865
from the time we're born,
we just hold the gun and kill.

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:41.165
That's all we know."

00:11:41.713 --> 00:11:43.182
And you know what that means.

00:11:43.206 --> 00:11:45.093
It's a trap to me, of course.

00:11:45.522 --> 00:11:48.975
So I walk out of there.
They said, "We'll let you go, go."

00:11:49.435 --> 00:11:52.339
And so I walked into the car,
I sit in the car,

00:11:52.363 --> 00:11:55.633
and I told the driver,
"Turn around and go back to the office."

00:11:55.999 --> 00:11:59.412
At that time, we only
were supporting girls.

00:11:59.436 --> 00:12:02.897
We only had money for women to train them,

00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:05.539
to send them to school, and nothing else.

00:12:05.881 --> 00:12:08.412
By the time I came to the office,

00:12:08.722 --> 00:12:10.975
of course my trainers were gone.

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:13.969
They ran away home. Nobody stayed there.

00:12:14.414 --> 00:12:16.914
My bodyguard was the only one there,

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.096
and my voice was completely gone.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.255
I was shaken up, and I sat on my table,

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:25.287
and I said, "What am I going to do?"

00:12:25.827 --> 00:12:28.303
How am I going to solve this problem?

00:12:28.327 --> 00:12:31.731
Because we had training
going on up north already.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.707
Hundreds of women were there
coming to get training.

00:12:36.295 --> 00:12:40.048
So I was sitting there,
all of a sudden, at this moment,

00:12:40.072 --> 00:12:42.025
talking about momentum, we are,

00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:44.382
at that moment,

00:12:44.406 --> 00:12:48.374
one of my wonderful donors
called me about a report.

00:12:49.207 --> 00:12:52.740
And she asked me, "Sakena?"
And I answered her.

00:12:52.764 --> 00:12:55.112
She said, "It's not you.
What's wrong with you?"

00:12:55.136 --> 00:12:57.755
I said, "Nothing." I tried to cover.

00:12:58.461 --> 00:13:01.317
No matter what I tried to do,
she didn't believe me,

00:13:01.341 --> 00:13:02.992
and she asked me again.

00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:04.858
"OK, tell me what's going on?"

00:13:04.882 --> 00:13:06.920
I told her the whole story.

00:13:06.944 --> 00:13:11.595
At that time, she said, "OK,
you go next time, and you will help them.

00:13:12.222 --> 00:13:13.833
You will help them."

00:13:14.142 --> 00:13:17.817
And when, two days later,
I went the same route,

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.857
and do you know, they were not in here,

00:13:20.881 --> 00:13:23.054
they were a little back further,

00:13:23.078 --> 00:13:27.627
the same young men, standing up there
and holding the rifle

00:13:27.651 --> 00:13:29.957
and pointing to us to stop the car.

00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:31.705
So we stopped the car.

00:13:31.729 --> 00:13:34.609
I got out. I said, "OK, let's go with me."

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:36.277
And they said, "Yes."

00:13:36.301 --> 00:13:40.729
I said, "On one condition,
that whatever I say, you accept it."

00:13:41.046 --> 00:13:42.625
And they said, yes, they do.

00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:44.522
So I took them to the mosque,

00:13:44.863 --> 00:13:47.652
and to make a long story short,

00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:50.422
I told them I'd give them teachers.

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:54.715
Today, they are the best trainers.

00:13:54.739 --> 00:13:56.398
They learn English,

00:13:56.422 --> 00:13:58.858
they learn how to be teachers,

00:13:58.882 --> 00:14:00.620
they learn computers,

00:14:00.644 --> 00:14:02.494
and they are my guides.

00:14:02.518 --> 00:14:06.355
Every area that is unknown to us
in the mountain areas,

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:08.626
they go with me.
They are ahead, and we go.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.307
And they protect us.

00:14:11.275 --> 00:14:12.426
And --

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:13.601
(Applause)

00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:14.776
Thank you.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.306
(Applause)

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.489
That tells you that education
transforms people.

00:14:23.513 --> 00:14:25.647
When you educate people,

00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:27.639
they are going to be different,

00:14:27.663 --> 00:14:29.346
and today all over,

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.742
we need to work for gender equality.

00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:35.472
We cannot only train women
but forget about the men,

00:14:35.496 --> 00:14:40.950
because the men are the real people
who are giving women the hardest time.

00:14:40.974 --> 00:14:42.553
(Laughter)

00:14:42.577 --> 00:14:46.338
So we started training men
because the men should know

00:14:46.362 --> 00:14:47.829
the potential of women,

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:50.354
know how much these potential men has,

00:14:50.378 --> 00:14:54.973
and how much these women
can do the same job they are doing.

00:14:54.997 --> 00:14:58.377
So we are continuously giving
training to men,

00:14:58.401 --> 00:15:01.687
and I really believe strongly.

00:15:01.711 --> 00:15:04.831
I live in a country
that was a beautiful country.

00:15:04.855 --> 00:15:06.673
I just want to share this with you.

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:08.824
It was a beautiful country,

00:15:08.848 --> 00:15:10.879
beautiful, peaceful country.

00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:13.228
We were going everywhere.

00:15:13.252 --> 00:15:15.325
Women were getting education:

00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:17.736
lawyer, engineer, teacher,

00:15:18.205 --> 00:15:20.372
and we were going from house to house.

00:15:20.396 --> 00:15:22.270
We never locked our doors.

00:15:22.912 --> 00:15:24.874
But you know what happened to my country.

00:15:24.898 --> 00:15:30.714
Today, people cannot walk
out of their door without security issues.

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:36.230
But we want the same
Afghanistan we had before.

00:15:36.254 --> 00:15:38.198
And I want to tell you the other side.

00:15:38.222 --> 00:15:41.777
Today, the women of Afghanistan
are working very, very hard.

00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:46.626
They are earning degrees.
They are training to be lawyers.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.880
They are training to be
doctors, back again.

00:15:48.904 --> 00:15:50.554
They are training to be teachers,

00:15:50.578 --> 00:15:52.562
and they are running businesses.

00:15:52.927 --> 00:15:55.365
So it is so wonderful

00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:59.792
to see people like that
reach their complete potential,

00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:02.387
and all of this is going to happen.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.554
I want to share this with you,

00:16:04.578 --> 00:16:05.982
because of love,

00:16:06.292 --> 00:16:08.085
because of compassion,

00:16:08.109 --> 00:16:11.196
and because of trust and honesty.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.638
If you have these few things with you,

00:16:14.939 --> 00:16:16.678
you will accomplish.

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:20.566
We have one poet, Mawlānā Rūmī.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:25.400
He said that by having compassion

00:16:25.424 --> 00:16:28.647
and having love,
you can conquer the world.

00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:30.241
And I tell you, we could.

00:16:30.265 --> 00:16:32.526
And if we could do it in Afghanistan,

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.892
I am sure 100 percent that everyone
can do it in any part of the world.

00:16:36.916 --> 00:16:38.655
Thank you very, very much.

00:16:38.679 --> 00:16:41.524
(Applause)

00:16:41.548 --> 00:16:46.975
Thank you. Thank you.

00:16:46.999 --> 00:16:50.238
(Applause)
