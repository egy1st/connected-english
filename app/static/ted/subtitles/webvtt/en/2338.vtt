00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.256
Imagine being unable to say,
"I am hungry," "I am in pain,"

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.816
"thank you," or "I love you."

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.936
Being trapped inside your body,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.096
a body that doesn't respond to commands.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.776
Surrounded by people,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.416
yet utterly alone.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.136
Wishing you could reach out,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.376
to connect, to comfort, to participate.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.480
For 13 long years, that was my reality.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.056
Most of us never think twice
about talking, about communicating.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.216
I've thought a lot about it.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.896
I've had a lot of time to think.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.016
For the first 12 years of my life,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.736
I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.896
Then everything changed.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.176
I contracted a brain infection.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.496
The doctors weren't sure what it was,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.016
but they treated me the best they could.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.416
However, I progressively got worse.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.616
Eventually, I lost my ability
to control my movements,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.976
make eye contact,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.239
and finally, my ability to speak.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.496
While in hospital,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.096
I desperately wanted to go home.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.416
I said to my mother, "When home?"

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.896
Those were the last words
I ever spoke with my own voice.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.736
I would eventually fail every test
for mental awareness.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.576
My parents were told
I was as good as not there.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.216
A vegetable, having the intelligence
of a three-month-old baby.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.896
They were told to take me home
and try to keep me comfortable

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.120
until I died.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.536
My parents, in fact
my entire family's lives,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.856
became consumed by taking care of me
the best they knew how.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.216
Their friends drifted away.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.056
One year turned to two,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.400
two turned to three.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.656
It seemed like the person I once was
began to disappear.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.576
The Lego blocks and electronic circuits
I'd loved as a boy were put away.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.056
I had been moved out of my bedroom
into another more practical one.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.776
I had become a ghost,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.175
a faded memory of a boy
people once knew and loved.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.456
Meanwhile, my mind began
knitting itself back together.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.496
Gradually, my awareness started to return.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.856
But no one realized
that I had come back to life.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.696
I was aware of everything,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.736
just like any normal person.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.056
I could see and understand everything,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.920
but I couldn't find a way
to let anybody know.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.536
My personality was entombed
within a seemingly silent body,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.280
a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight
within a chrysalis.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.656
The stark reality hit me
that I was going to spend

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.336
the rest of my life locked inside myself,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.056
totally alone.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.696
I was trapped with only
my thoughts for company.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.896
I would never be rescued.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.856
No one would ever show me tenderness.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.136
I would never talk to a friend.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.080
No one would ever love me.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.056
I had no dreams, no hope,
nothing to look forward to.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.576
Well, nothing pleasant.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.936
I lived in fear,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.496
and, to put it bluntly,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.576
was waiting for death
to finally release me,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.496
expecting to die all alone in a care home.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.896
I don't know if it's truly possible
to express in words

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.736
what it's like not to be able
to communicate.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.176
Your personality appears
to vanish into a heavy fog

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.976
and all of your emotions and desires are
constricted, stifled and muted within you.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.496
For me, the worst was the feeling
of utter powerlessness.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.960
I simply existed.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.136
It's a very dark place to find yourself

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.840
because in a sense, you have vanished.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.216
Other people controlled
every aspect of my life.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.536
They decided what I ate and when.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.536
Whether I was laid on my side
or strapped into my wheelchair.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.936
I often spent my days
positioned in front of the TV

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.800
watching Barney reruns.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.336
I think because Barney
is so happy and jolly,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.096
and I absolutely wasn't,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.800
it made it so much worse.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.216
I was completely powerless
to change anything in my life

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.696
or people's perceptions of me.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.296
I was a silent, invisible observer
of how people behaved

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.696
when they thought no one was watching.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.416
Unfortunately, I wasn't only an observer.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.416
With no way to communicate,
I became the perfect victim:

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.416
a defenseless object,
seemingly devoid of feelings

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.176
that people used
to play out their darkest desires.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.856
For more than 10 years,
people who were charged with my care

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.040
abused me physically,
verbally and sexually.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.520
Despite what they thought, I did feel.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.136
The first time it happened,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.816
I was shocked and filled with disbelief.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.360
How could they do this to me?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.696
I was confused.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.840
What had I done to deserve this?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.496
Part of me wanted to cry
and another part wanted to fight.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.256
Hurt, sadness and anger
flooded through me.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.056
I felt worthless.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.000
There was no one to comfort me.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.336
But neither of my parents
knew this was happening.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.416
I lived in terror, knowing
it would happen again and again.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.536
I just never knew when.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.320
All I knew was that I would
never be the same.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.976
I remember once listening
to Whitney Houston singing,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.856
"No matter what they take from me,
they can't take away my dignity."

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.800
And I thought to myself,
"You want to bet?"

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.856
Perhaps my parents could have
found out and could have helped.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.136
But the years of constant caretaking,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.056
having to wake up
every two hours to turn me,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.456
combined with them essentially
grieving the loss of their son,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.816
had taken a toll on my mother and father.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.416
Following yet another heated argument
between my parents,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.056
in a moment of despair and desperation,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.400
my mother turned to me
and told me that I should die.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.296
I was shocked, but as I thought
about what she had said,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.336
I was filled with enormous compassion
and love for my mother,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.320
yet I could do nothing about it.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.016
There were many moments when I gave up,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.416
sinking into a dark abyss.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.576
I remember one particularly low moment.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.856
My dad left me alone in the car

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.456
while he quickly went
to buy something from the store.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.096
A random stranger walked past,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.960
looked at me and he smiled.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.016
I may never know why, but that simple act,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.336
the fleeting moment of human connection,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.736
transformed how I was feeling,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.680
making me want to keep going.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.696
My existence was tortured by monotony,

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.736
a reality that was often too much to bear.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.896
Alone with my thoughts,
I constructed intricate fantasies

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.296
about ants running across the floor.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.416
I taught myself to tell the time
by noticing where the shadows were.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.576
As I learned how the shadows moved
as the hours of the day passed,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.256
I understood how long it would be
before I was picked up and taken home.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.536
Seeing my father walk
through the door to collect me

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.720
was the best moment of the day.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.936
My mind became a tool that I could use

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.776
to either close down
to retreat from my reality

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.776
or enlarge into a gigantic space
that I could fill with fantasies.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.776
I hoped that my reality would change

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.656
and someone would see
that I had come back to life.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.376
But I had been washed away
like a sand castle

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.536
built too close to the waves,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.736
and in my place was the person
people expected me to be.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.536
To some I was Martin,
a vacant shell, the vegetable,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.976
deserving of harsh words,
dismissal and even abuse.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.936
To others, I was the tragically
brain-damaged boy

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.176
who had grown to become a man.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.376
Someone they were kind to and cared for.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.896
Good or bad, I was a blank canvas

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.240
onto which different versions
of myself were projected.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.456
It took someone new
to see me in a different way.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.736
An aromatherapist began coming
to the care home about once a week.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.736
Whether through intuition
or her attention to details

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.776
that others failed to notice,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.936
she became convinced that I could
understand what was being said.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.456
She urged my parents
to have me tested by experts

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.776
in augmentative
and alternative communication.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.016
And within a year,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.096
I was beginning to use
a computer program to communicate.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.856
It was exhilarating,
but frustrating at times.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.856
I had so many words in my mind,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.696
that I couldn't wait
to be able to share them.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.456
Sometimes, I would say things to myself
simply because I could.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.096
In myself, I had a ready audience,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.256
and I believed that by expressing
my thoughts and wishes,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.016
others would listen, too.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.296
But as I began to communicate more,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.496
I realized that it was in fact
only just the beginning

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.456
of creating a new voice for myself.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.816
I was thrust into a world
I didn't quite know how to function in.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.496
I stopped going to the care home

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.376
and managed to get my first job
making photocopies.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.856
As simple as this may sound,
it was amazing.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.896
My new world was really exciting

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.736
but often quite overwhelming
and frightening.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.576
I was like a man-child,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.696
and as liberating as it often was,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.456
I struggled.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.016
I also learned that many of those
who had known me for a long time

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.696
found it impossible to abandon the idea
of Martin they had in their heads.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.336
While those I had only just met

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.120
struggled to look past the image
of a silent man in a wheelchair.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.736
I realized that some people
would only listen to me

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.776
if what I said was in line
with what they expected.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.816
Otherwise, it was disregarded

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.496
and they did what they felt was best.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.536
I discovered that true communication

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.376
is about more than merely
physically conveying a message.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.360
It is about getting the message
heard and respected.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.216
Still, things were going well.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.816
My body was slowly getting stronger.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.296
I had a job in computing that I loved,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.216
and had even got Kojak, the dog
I had been dreaming about for years.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.176
However, I longed to share
my life with someone.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.616
I remember staring out the window
as my dad drove me home from work,

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.336
thinking I have so much love inside of me
and nobody to give it to.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.816
Just as I had resigned myself
to being single for the rest of my life,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.616
I met Joan.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.096
Not only is she the best thing
that has ever happened to me,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.016
but Joan helped me to challenge
my own misconceptions about myself.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.656
Joan said it was through my words
that she fell in love with me.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.456
However, after all I had been through,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.216
I still couldn't shake the belief

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.456
that nobody could truly see
beyond my disability

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.056
and accept me for who I am.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.256
I also really struggled
to comprehend that I was a man.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.096
The first time someone
referred to me as a man,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.416
it stopped me in my tracks.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.056
I felt like looking around
and asking, "Who, me?"

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.256
That all changed with Joan.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.856
We have an amazing connection

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.536
and I learned how important it is
to communicate openly and honestly.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.496
I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence
to truly say what I thought.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.816
I started to feel whole again,
a man worthy of love.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.296
I began to reshape my destiny.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.536
I spoke up a little more at work.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.936
I asserted my need for independence
to the people around me.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.816
Being given a means of communication
changed everything.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.056
I used the power of words and will
to challenge the preconceptions

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.656
of those around me
and those I had of myself.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.376
Communication is what makes us human,

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.696
enabling us to connect
on the deepest level

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.656
with those around us --

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.256
telling our own stories,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.896
expressing wants, needs and desires,

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.056
or hearing those of others
by really listening.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.416
All this is how the world
knows who we are.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.240
So who are we without it?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.656
True communication increases understanding

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.720
and creates a more caring
and compassionate world.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.896
Once, I was perceived
to be an inanimate object,

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.216
a mindless phantom
of a boy in a wheelchair.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.496
Today, I am so much more.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.936
A husband, a son, a friend,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.216
a brother, a business owner,
a first-class honors graduate,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.576
a keen amateur photographer.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.440
It is my ability to communicate
that has given me all this.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.016
We are told that actions
speak louder than words.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.976
But I wonder,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.200
do they?

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.536
Our words, however we communicate them,

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.656
are just as powerful.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.416
Whether we speak the words
with our own voices,

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.776
type them with our eyes,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.056
or communicate them non-verbally
to someone who speaks them for us,

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.960
words are among our most powerful tools.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.216
I have come to you through
a terrible darkness,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.336
pulled from it by caring souls

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.696
and by language itself.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.736
The act of you listening to me today
brings me farther into the light.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.056
We are shining here together.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.376
If there is one most difficult obstacle
to my way of communicating,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.336
it is that sometimes I want to shout

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.656
and other times simply to whisper
a word of love or gratitude.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.936
It all sounds the same.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.376
But if you will,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.160
please imagine these next two words
as warmly as you can:

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.680
Thank you.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:55.080
(Applause)
