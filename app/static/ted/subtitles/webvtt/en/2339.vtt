WEBVTT

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.136
Over our lifetimes,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.120
we've all contributed to climate change.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.456
Actions, choices and behaviors

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.360
will have led to an increase
in greenhouse gas emissions.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.176
And I think that that's
quite a powerful thought.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.616
But it does have the potential
to make us feel guilty

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.416
when we think about decisions
we might have made

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.936
around where to travel to,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.960
how often and how,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.296
about the energy that we choose to use

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.920
in our homes or in our workplaces,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.360
or quite simply the lifestyles
that we lead and enjoy.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.136
But we can also turn
that thought on its head,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.696
and think that if we've had
such a profound

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.560
but a negative impact
on our climate already,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.296
then we have an opportunity to influence
the amount of future climate change

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.200
that we will need to adapt to.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.776
So we have a choice.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.216
We can either choose to start
to take climate change seriously,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.896
and significantly cut and mitigate
our greenhouse gas emissions,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.240
and then we will have to adapt to less
of the climate change impacts in future.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.960
Alternatively, we can continue to really
ignore the climate change problem.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.336
But if we do that, we are also choosing

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.880
to adapt to very much more powerful
climate impacts in future.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.536
And not only that.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.936
As people who live in countries
with high per capita emissions,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.360
we're making that choice
on behalf of others as well.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.096
But the choice that we don't have

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.440
is a no climate change future.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.256
Over the last two decades,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.136
our government negotiators
and policymakers have been coming together

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.080
to discuss climate change,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.856
and they've been focused on
avoiding a two-degree centigrade warming

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.680
above pre-industrial levels.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.096
That's the temperature that's associated
with dangerous impacts

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.720
across a range of different indicators,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.736
to humans and to the environment.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.919
So two degrees centigrade
constitutes dangerous climate change.

00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:12.736
But dangerous climate change
can be subjective.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.056
So if we think about
an extreme weather event

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.128
that might happen
in some part of the world,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.416
and if that happens in a part of the world
where there is good infrastructure,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.200
where there are people
that are well-insured and so on,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.136
then that impact can be disruptive.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.416
It can cause upset, it could cause cost.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.160
It could even cause some deaths.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.096
But if that exact same weather event
happens in a part of the world

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.136
where there is poor infrastructure,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.376
or where people are not well-insured,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.816
or they're not having
good support networks,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.880
then that same climate change impact
could be devastating.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.856
It could cause a significant loss of home,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.880
but it could also cause
significant amounts of death.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.776
So this is a graph of the CO2 emissions
at the left-hand side

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.616
from fossil fuel and industry,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.616
and time from before
the Industrial Revolution

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.240
out towards the present day.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.296
And what's immediately striking about this

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.360
is that emissions
have been growing exponentially.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.376
If we focus in on a shorter
period of time from 1950,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.496
we have established in 1988

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.160
the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.296
the Rio Earth Summit in 1992,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.360
then rolling on a few years,
in 2009 we had the Copenhagen Accord,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.456
where it established avoiding
a two-degree temperature rise

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.960
in keeping with the science
and on the basis of equity.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.616
And then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.456
And all the way through,
during all of these meetings

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.040
and many others as well,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.640
emissions have continued to rise.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.136
And if we focus on our historical
emission trend in recent years,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.376
and we put that together
with our understanding

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.880
of the direction of travel
in our global economy,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.016
then we are much more on track

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.040
for a four-degree centigrade
global warming

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.680
than we are for the two-degree centigrade.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.136
Now, let's just pause for a moment

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.959
and think about this four-degree
global average temperature.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.760
Most of our planet
is actually made up of the sea.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.880
Now, because the sea has a greater
thermal inertia than the land,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.656
the average temperatures over land
are actually going to be higher

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.200
than they are over the sea.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.256
The second thing is that we
as human beings don't experience

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.840
global average temperatures.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.016
We experience hot days, cold days,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.960
rainy days, especially if you live
in Manchester like me.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.456
So now put yourself in a city center.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.056
Imagine somewhere in the world:

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.456
Mumbai, Beijing, New York, London.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.680
It's the hottest day
that you've ever experienced.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.496
There's sun beating down,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.880
there's concrete and glass all around you.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.816
Now imagine that same day --

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.440
but it's six, eight,
maybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.520
on that day during that heat wave.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.254
That's the kind of thing
we're going to experience

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:15.318
under a four-degree global
average temperature scenario.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.736
And the problem with these extremes,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.576
and not just the temperature extremes,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.656
but also the extremes in terms of storms
and other climate impacts,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.160
is our infrastructure is just not set up
to deal with these sorts of events.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.416
So our roads and our rail networks

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.616
have been designed to last for a long time

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.296
and withstand only
certain amounts of impacts

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.936
in different parts of the world.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.216
And this is going to be
extremely challenged.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.776
Our power stations
are expected to be cooled by water

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.560
to a certain temperature
to remain effective and resilient.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.136
And our buildings
are designed to be comfortable

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.376
within a particular temperature range.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.536
And this is all going to be
significantly challenged

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.816
under a four-degree-type scenario.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.640
Our infrastructure has not been
designed to cope with this.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.296
So if we go back, also thinking
about four degrees,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.296
it's not just the direct impacts,

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.320
but also some indirect impacts.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.520
So if we take food security, for example.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.760
Maize and wheat yields

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.816
in some parts of the world

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.800
are expected to be up to 40 percent lower

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.216
under a four-degree scenario,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.840
rice up to 30 percent lower.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.680
This will be absolutely devastating
for global food security.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.616
So all in all, the kinds
of impacts anticipated

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.400
under this four-degree centigrade scenario

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.680
are going to be incompatible
with global organized living.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.800
So back to our trajectories and our graphs
of four degrees and two degrees.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.400
Is it reasonable still
to focus on the two-degree path?

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.736
There are quite a lot of my colleagues
and other scientists

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.080
who would say that it's now too late
to avoid a two-degree warming.

00:06:59.857 --> 00:07:02.096
But I would just like
to draw on my own research

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.176
on energy systems, on food systems,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.040
aviation and also shipping,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.656
just to say that I think there is still
a small fighting chance

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.296
of avoiding this two-degree
dangerous climate change.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.701
But we really need
to get to grips with the numbers

00:07:17.725 --> 00:07:18.925
to work out how to do it.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.640
So if you focus in on this trajectory
and these graphs,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.056
the yellow circle there
highlights that the departure

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.576
from the red four-degree pathway

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.640
to the two-degree
green pathway is immediate.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.016
And that's because
of cumulative emissions,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.616
or the carbon budget.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.296
So in other words, because
of the lights and the projectors

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.016
that are on in this room right now,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.993
the CO2 that is going into our atmosphere

00:07:45.017 --> 00:07:47.337
as a result of that
electricity consumption

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.176
lasts a very long time.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.216
Some of it will be in our atmosphere
for a century, maybe much longer.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.960
It will accumulate, and greenhouse gases
tend to be cumulative.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.576
And that tells us something
about these trajectories.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.616
First of all, it tells us that it's
the area under these curves that matter,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.616
not where we reach
at a particular date in future.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.831
And that's important,
because it doesn't matter

00:08:09.855 --> 00:08:12.656
if we come up with some amazing
whiz-bang technology

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.536
to sort out our energy problem
on the last day of 2049,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.856
just in the nick of time
to sort things out.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.000
Because in the meantime,
emissions will have accumulated.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.800
So if we continue on this red,
four-degree centigrade scenario pathway,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.216
the longer we continue on it,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.616
that will need to be
made up for in later years

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.480
to keep the same carbon budget,
to keep the same area under the curve,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.056
which means that that trajectory,
the red one there, becomes steeper.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.816
So in other words, if we don't reduce
emissions in the short to medium term,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.560
then we'll have to make more significant
year-on-year emission reductions.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.760
We also know that we have
to decarbonize our energy system.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.096
But if we don't start to cut
emissions in the short to medium term,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.480
then we will have to do that even sooner.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.960
So this poses really big
challenges for us.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.200
The other thing it does is tells us
something about energy policy.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.696
If you live in a part of the world where
per capita emissions are already high,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.160
it points us towards
reducing energy demand.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.136
And that's because
with all the will in the world,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.696
the large-scale engineering infrastructure

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.856
that we need to roll out rapidly

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.976
to decarbonize the supply side
of our energy system

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.240
is just simply not going
to happen in time.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.136
So it doesn't matter
whether we choose nuclear power

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.016
or carbon capture and storage,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.376
upscale our biofuel production,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.616
or go for a much bigger roll-out
of wind turbines and wave turbines.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.280
All of that will take time.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.256
So because it's the area
under the curve that matters,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.216
we need to focus on energy efficiency,

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.760
but also on energy conservation --
in other words, using less energy.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.416
And if we do that, that also means

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.080
that as we continue to roll out
the supply-side technology,

00:09:59.381 --> 00:10:02.096
we will have less of a job to do
if we've actually managed

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.416
to reduce our energy consumption,

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.920
because we will then need
less infrastructure on the supply side.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.296
Another issue that we really
need to grapple with

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.520
is the issue of well-being and equity.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.720
There are many parts of the world where
the standard of living needs to rise.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.176
Bbut with energy systems
currently reliant on fossil fuel,

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.760
as those economies grow
so will emissions.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.896
And now, if we're all constrained
by the same amount of carbon budget,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.456
that means that if some parts of
the world's emissions are needing to rise,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.160
then other parts of the world's
emissions need to reduce.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.160
So that poses very significant challenges
for wealthy nations.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.360
Because according to our research,

00:10:48.705 --> 00:10:51.896
if you're in a country where per capita
emissions are really high --

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.360
so North America, Europe, Australia --

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.136
emissions reductions of the order
of 10 percent per year,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.216
and starting immediately,
will be required for a good chance

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.320
of avoiding the two-degree target.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.896
Let me just put that into context.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.736
The economist Nicholas Stern

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.976
said that emission reductions
of more than one percent per year

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.520
had only ever been associated
with economic recession or upheaval.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.840
So this poses huge challenges
for the issue of economic growth,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.960
because if we have our
high carbon infrastructure in place,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.680
it means that if our economies grow,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.720
then so do our emissions.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.336
So I'd just like to take
a quote from a paper

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.760
by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.480
where we said that to avoid the two-degree
framing of dangerous climate change,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.216
economic growth needs to be exchanged
at least temporarily

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.640
for a period of planned austerity
in wealthy nations.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.400
This is a really difficult
message to take,

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.960
because what it suggests is that
we really need to do things differently.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.440
This is not about just incremental change.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.256
This is about doing things differently,
about whole system change,

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.976
and sometimes
it's about doing less things.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.416
And this applies to all of us,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.600
whatever sphere of influence we have.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.136
So it could be from writing
to our local politician

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.360
to talking to our boss at work
or being the boss at work,

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.160
or talking with our friends and family,
or, quite simply, changing our lifestyles.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.440
Because we really need
to make significant change.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.136
At the moment, we're choosing
a four-degree scenario.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.496
If we really want to avoid
the two-degree scenario,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.096
there really is no time
like the present to act.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.336
Thank you.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:58.120
(Applause)

00:13:00.827 --> 00:13:03.256
Bruno Giussani: Alice,
basically what you're saying,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.736
the talk is, unless wealthy nations
start cutting 10 percent per year

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.616
the emissions now, this year,
not in 2020 or '25,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.600
we are going to go straight
to the four-plus-degree scenario.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.896
I am wondering what's your take
on the cut by 70 percent for 2070.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.496
Alice Bows-Larkin: Yeah, it's just
nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.004
One of the things that often --

00:13:25.028 --> 00:13:28.576
when there are these modeling studies
that look at what we need to do,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.096
is they tend to hugely overestimate
how quickly other countries in the world

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.696
can start to reduce emissions.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.056
So they make kind of
heroic assumptions about that.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.842
The more we do that,
because it's the cumulative emissions,

00:13:40.866 --> 00:13:42.824
the short-term stuff that really matters.

00:13:42.832 --> 00:13:44.467
So it does make a huge difference.

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.456
If a big country like China, for example,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.896
continues to grow
even for just a few extra years,

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.936
that will make a big difference
to when we need to decarbonize.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.456
So I don't think we can even say
when it will be,

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.440
because it all depends
on what we have to do in the short term.

00:13:57.464 --> 00:14:00.736
But I think we've just got huge scope,
and we don't pull those levers

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.680
that allow us to reduce
the energy demand, which is a shame.

00:14:03.998 --> 00:14:06.856
BG: Alice, thank you for coming
to TED and sharing this data.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.080
ABL: Thank you.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.000
(Applause)
