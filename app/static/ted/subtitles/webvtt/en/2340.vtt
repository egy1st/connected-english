00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.616
In the year 1901,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.120
a woman called Auguste was taken
to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.496
Auguste was delusional

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.520
and couldn't remember
even the most basic details of her life.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.400
Her doctor was called Alois.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.096
Alois didn't know how to help Auguste,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.640
but he watched over her until,
sadly, she passed away in 1906.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.256
After she died, Alois performed an autopsy

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.496
and found strange plaques
and tangles in Auguste's brain --

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.856
the likes of which he'd never seen before.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.040
Now here's the even more striking thing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.960
If Auguste had instead been alive today,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.280
we could offer her no more help
than Alois was able to 114 years ago.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.640
Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.656
And Auguste Deter

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.920
was the first patient to be diagnosed with
what we now call Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.640
Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.136
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines
to protect us from infections,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.016
many treatments for cancer,
antiretrovirals for HIV,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.520
statins for heart disease and much more.

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:17.761
But we've made essentially no progress
at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.976
I'm part of a team of scientists

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.286
who has been working to find
a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.256
So I think about this all the time.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.880
Alzheimer's now affects
40 million people worldwide.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.560
But by 2050, it will affect
150 million people --

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.520
which, by the way,
will include many of you.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
If you're hoping
to live to be 85 or older,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.840
your chance of getting Alzheimer's
will be almost one in two.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.816
In other words, odds are
you'll spend your golden years

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.056
either suffering from Alzheimer's

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.400
or helping to look after a friend
or loved one with Alzheimer's.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.456
Already in the United States alone,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.759
Alzheimer's care costs
200 billion dollars every year.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.920
One out of every five
Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.816
It is today the most expensive disease,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.056
and costs are projected
to increase fivefold by 2050,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.240
as the baby boomer generation ages.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.376
It may surprise you that, put simply,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.960
Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical
and social challenges of our generation.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.040
But we've done relatively
little to address it.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.480
Today, of the top 10
causes of death worldwide,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.520
Alzheimer's is the only one
we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.160
We understand less about the science
of Alzheimer's than other diseases

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.600
because we've invested less time
and money into researching it.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.376
The US government
spends 10 times more every year

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.376
on cancer research than on Alzheimer's

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.440
despite the fact
that Alzheimer's costs us more

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.720
and causes a similar number
of deaths each year as cancer.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.616
The lack of resources
stems from a more fundamental cause:

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.000
a lack of awareness.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.000
Because here's what few people know
but everyone should:

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.640
Alzheimer's is a disease,
and we can cure it.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.856
For most of the past 114 years,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.336
everyone, including scientists, mistakenly
confused Alzheimer's with aging.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.837
We thought that becoming senile

00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:40.100
was a normal and inevitable
part of getting old.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.016
But we only have to look at a picture

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.896
of a healthy aged brain compared
to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.960
to see the real physical damage
caused by this disease.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.816
As well as triggering severe loss
of memory and mental abilities,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.056
the damage to the brain
caused by Alzheimer's

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.840
significantly reduces life expectancy
and is always fatal.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.536
Remember Dr. Alzheimer
found strange plaques and tangles

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.560
in Auguste's brain a century ago.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.280
For almost a century,
we didn't know much about these.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.920
Today we know they're made
from protein molecules.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.296
You can imagine a protein molecule

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.360
as a piece of paper that normally folds
into an elaborate piece of origami.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.256
There are spots
on the paper that are sticky.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.536
And when it folds correctly,
these sticky bits end up on the inside.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.016
But sometimes things go wrong,
and some sticky bits are on the outside.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.056
This causes the protein molecules
to stick to each other,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.760
forming clumps that eventually become
large plaques and tangles.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.400
That's what we see
in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.336
We've spent the past 10 years
at the University of Cambridge

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.080
trying to understand
how this malfunction works.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.496
There are many steps, and identifying
which step to try to block is complex --

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.800
like defusing a bomb.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.696
Cutting one wire might do nothing.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.320
Cutting others might
make the bomb explore.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.336
We have to find the right step to block,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.480
and then create a drug that does it.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.056
Until recently, we for the most part

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.536
have been cutting wires
and hoping for the best.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.416
But now we've got together
a diverse group of people --

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.016
medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists,
physicists, engineers and mathematicians.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.256
And together, we've managed
to identify a critical step in the process

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.496
and are now testing a new class of drugs
which would specifically block this step

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.040
and stop the disease.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.856
Now let me show you
some of our latest results.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.536
No one outside of our lab
has seen these yet.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.536
Let's look at some videos of what happened
when we tested these new drugs in worms.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.416
So these are healthy worms,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.640
and you can see
they're moving around normally.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.000
These worms, on the other hand,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.576
have protein molecules
sticking together inside them --

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.216
like humans with Alzheimer's.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.536
And you can see they're clearly sick.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.536
But if we give our new drugs
to these worms at an early stage,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.240
then we see that they're healthy,
and they live a normal lifespan.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.856
This is just an initial positive result,
but research like this

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.616
shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease
that we can understand and we can cure.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.536
After 114 years of waiting,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.936
there's finally real hope
for what can be achieved

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.680
in the next 10 or 20 years.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.360
But to grow that hope,
to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.776
This isn't about scientists like me --

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.000
it's about you.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.176
We need you to raise awareness
that Alzheimer's is a disease

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.816
and that if we try, we can beat it.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.656
In the case of other diseases,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.816
patients and their families
have led the charge for more research

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.776
and put pressure on governments,
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.016
scientists and regulators.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.896
That was essential for advancing treatment
for HIV in the late 1980s.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.600
Today, we see that same drive
to beat cancer.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.656
But Alzheimer's patients are often
unable to speak up for themselves.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.416
And their families, the hidden victims,
caring for their loved ones night and day,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.480
are often too worn out
to go out and advocate for change.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.400
So, it really is down to you.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.056
Alzheimer's isn't,
for the most part, a genetic disease.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.200
Everyone with a brain is at risk.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.656
Today, there are 40 million
patients like Auguste,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.576
who can't create the change
they need for themselves.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.160
Help speak up for them,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.280
and help demand a cure.

00:07:35.346 --> 00:07:36.496
Thank you.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.120
(Applause)
