00:00:00.571 --> 00:00:03.358
Raise your hand if you've ever
been asked the question

00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:06.382
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:00:06.737 --> 00:00:08.322
Now if you had to guess,

00:00:08.346 --> 00:00:11.763
how old would you say you were
when you were first asked this question?

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:13.386
You can just hold up fingers.

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.632
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK.

00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:23.332
Now, raise your hand if the question

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.378
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:27.932
has ever caused you any anxiety.

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:29.586
(Laughter)

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.832
Any anxiety at all.

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:35.975
I'm someone who's never
been able to answer the question

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.289
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:00:38.313 --> 00:00:41.749
See, the problem wasn't
that I didn't have any interests --

00:00:41.773 --> 00:00:43.975
it's that I had too many.

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.450
In high school, I liked English
and math and art and I built websites

00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:52.810
and I played guitar in a punk band
called Frustrated Telephone Operator.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:54.975
Maybe you've heard of us.

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.299
(Laughter)

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.228
This continued after high school,

00:00:59.252 --> 00:01:03.660
and at a certain point, I began
to notice this pattern in myself

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:06.237
where I would become interested in an area

00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:09.420
and I would dive in, become all-consumed,

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.975
and I'd get to be pretty good
at whatever it was,

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:17.601
and then I would hit this point
where I'd start to get bored.

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:20.822
And usually I would try
and persist anyway,

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:23.743
because I had already devoted
so much time and energy

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:26.263
and sometimes money into this field.

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:28.590
But eventually this sense of boredom,

00:01:28.614 --> 00:01:33.394
this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this,
this isn't challenging anymore --

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:35.053
it would get to be too much.

00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:37.410
And I would have to let it go.

00:01:38.262 --> 00:01:40.763
But then I would become interested
in something else,

00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:43.975
something totally unrelated,
and I would dive into that,

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.261
and become all-consumed,
and I'd be like, "Yes! I found my thing,"

00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:52.582
and then I would hit this point again
where I'd start to get bored.

00:01:53.352 --> 00:01:56.147
And eventually, I would let it go.

00:01:57.106 --> 00:02:00.174
But then I would discover
something new and totally different,

00:02:00.198 --> 00:02:01.769
and I would dive into that.

00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:06.842
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety,

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.048
for two reasons.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.292
The first was that I wasn't sure

00:02:11.316 --> 00:02:14.329
how I was going to turn
any of this into a career.

00:02:14.353 --> 00:02:17.151
I thought that I would eventually
have to pick one thing,

00:02:17.175 --> 00:02:19.389
deny all of my other passions,

00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:22.809
and just resign myself to being bored.

00:02:23.595 --> 00:02:25.914
The other reason it caused me
so much anxiety

00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:27.572
was a little bit more personal.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.948
I worried that there
was something wrong with this,

00:02:30.972 --> 00:02:35.090
and something wrong with me
for being unable to stick with anything.

00:02:35.677 --> 00:02:38.064
I worried that I was afraid of commitment,

00:02:38.088 --> 00:02:41.549
or that I was scattered,
or that I was self-sabotaging,

00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:43.239
afraid of my own success.

00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:48.975
If you can relate to my story
and to these feelings,

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.273
I'd like you to ask yourself a question

00:02:51.297 --> 00:02:53.883
that I wish I had asked myself back then.

00:02:54.796 --> 00:03:00.222
Ask yourself where you learned to assign
the meaning of wrong or abnormal

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:02.067
to doing many things.

00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:05.480
I'll tell you where you learned it:

00:03:05.504 --> 00:03:07.590
you learned it from the culture.

00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:13.865
We are first asked the question
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.457
when we're about five years old.

00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:19.174
And the truth is that no one really cares
what you say when you're that age.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.199
(Laughter)

00:03:20.223 --> 00:03:22.598
It's considered an innocuous question,

00:03:22.622 --> 00:03:24.982
posed to little kids
to elicit cute replies,

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:28.679
like, "I want to be an astronaut,"
or "I want to be a ballerina,"

00:03:28.703 --> 00:03:30.586
or "I want to be a pirate."

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.560
Insert Halloween costume here.

00:03:32.584 --> 00:03:34.095
(Laughter)

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:38.531
But this question gets asked of us
again and again as we get older

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:42.432
in various forms -- for instance,
high school students might get asked

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:44.683
what major they're going
to pick in college.

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:46.970
And at some point,

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:49.022
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:03:49.046 --> 00:03:52.404
goes from being
the cute exercise it once was

00:03:52.428 --> 00:03:54.700
to the thing that keeps us up at night.

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:56.287
Why?

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.494
See, while this question inspires kids
to dream about what they could be,

00:04:02.518 --> 00:04:05.930
it does not inspire them to dream
about all that they could be.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.352
In fact, it does just the opposite,

00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:11.392
because when someone asks you
what you want to be,

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:14.212
you can't reply with 20 different things,

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:17.131
though well-meaning adults
will likely chuckle and be like,

00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:21.207
"Oh, how cute, but you can't be
a violin maker and a psychologist.

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:23.034
You have to choose."

00:04:24.105 --> 00:04:25.874
This is Dr. Bob Childs --

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:28.975
(Laughter)

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.899
and he's a luthier and psychotherapist.

00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:37.124
And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor
turned illustrator, entrepreneur,

00:04:37.148 --> 00:04:39.095
teacher and creative director.

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:41.825
But most kids don't hear
about people like this.

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.975
All they hear

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.299
is that they're going to have to choose.

00:04:47.418 --> 00:04:49.379
But it's more than that.

00:04:49.403 --> 00:04:52.395
The notion of the narrowly focused life

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.791
is highly romanticized in our culture.

00:04:55.218 --> 00:04:59.398
It's this idea of destiny
or the one true calling,

00:04:59.422 --> 00:05:02.179
the idea that we each have one great thing

00:05:02.203 --> 00:05:04.536
we are meant to do
during our time on this earth,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.443
and you need to figure out
what that thing is

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:09.952
and devote your life to it.

00:05:11.135 --> 00:05:14.246
But what if you're someone
who isn't wired this way?

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:18.404
What if there are a lot of different
subjects that you're curious about,

00:05:18.428 --> 00:05:20.453
and many different things you want to do?

00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:25.123
Well, there is no room for someone
like you in this framework.

00:05:25.814 --> 00:05:27.785
And so you might feel alone.

00:05:28.412 --> 00:05:30.625
You might feel like you don't
have a purpose.

00:05:31.017 --> 00:05:33.702
And you might feel like
there's something wrong with you.

00:05:34.758 --> 00:05:36.480
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:05:36.908 --> 00:05:40.501
What you are is a multipotentialite.

00:05:40.525 --> 00:05:42.975
(Laughter)

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:49.964
(Applause)

00:05:50.312 --> 00:05:55.265
A multipotentialite is someone
with many interests and creative pursuits.

00:05:55.852 --> 00:05:57.798
It's a mouthful to say.

00:05:57.822 --> 00:06:00.672
It might help if you break it up
into three parts:

00:06:00.696 --> 00:06:04.688
multi, potential, and ite.

00:06:04.712 --> 00:06:07.932
You can also use one of the other terms
that connote the same idea,

00:06:07.956 --> 00:06:10.922
such as polymath, the Renaissance person.

00:06:10.946 --> 00:06:12.890
Actually, during the Renaissance period,

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:16.573
it was considered the ideal
to be well-versed in multiple disciplines.

00:06:17.026 --> 00:06:19.633
Barbara Sher refers to us as "scanners."

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:23.437
Use whichever term you like,
or invent your own.

00:06:23.461 --> 00:06:26.516
I have to say I find it sort of fitting
that as a community,

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.002
we cannot agree on a single identity.

00:06:29.026 --> 00:06:31.026
(Laughter)

00:06:33.017 --> 00:06:35.414
It's easy to see your multipotentiality

00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:39.351
as a limitation or an affliction
that you need to overcome.

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:41.768
But what I've learned
through speaking with people

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:44.260
and writing about these
ideas on my website,

00:06:44.284 --> 00:06:48.735
is that there are some tremendous
strengths to being this way.

00:06:49.656 --> 00:06:51.617
Here are three

00:06:51.641 --> 00:06:54.526
multipotentialite super powers.

00:06:55.384 --> 00:06:58.560
One: idea synthesis.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:01.277
That is, combining two or more fields

00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:03.967
and creating something new
at the intersection.

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:08.899
Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew
from their shared interests

00:07:08.923 --> 00:07:14.419
in cartography, data visualization,
travel, mathematics and design,

00:07:14.443 --> 00:07:16.063
when they founded Meshu.

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:22.671
Meshu is a company that creates
custom geographically-inspired jewelry.

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.835
Sha and Rachel came up
with this unique idea

00:07:25.859 --> 00:07:31.609
not despite, but because of their eclectic
mix of skills and experiences.

00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:36.336
Innovation happens at the intersections.

00:07:36.797 --> 00:07:38.908
That's where the new ideas come from.

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:42.678
And multipotentialites,
with all of their backgrounds,

00:07:42.702 --> 00:07:46.237
are able to access a lot of these
points of intersection.

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:51.071
The second multipotentialite superpower

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:52.586
is rapid learning.

00:07:53.404 --> 00:07:56.266
When multipotentialites
become interested in something,

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.345
we go hard.

00:07:58.369 --> 00:08:01.140
We observe everything
we can get our hands on.

00:08:01.164 --> 00:08:02.907
We're also used to being beginners,

00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:06.053
because we've been beginners
so many times in the past,

00:08:06.077 --> 00:08:09.356
and this means that we're less afraid
of trying new things

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.762
and stepping out of our comfort zones.

00:08:11.786 --> 00:08:15.815
What's more, many skills
are transferable across disciplines,

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:19.694
and we bring everything we've learned
to every new area we pursue,

00:08:19.718 --> 00:08:22.011
so we're rarely starting from scratch.

00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:26.597
Nora Dunn is a full-time traveler
and freelance writer.

00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:30.928
As a child concert pianist,
she honed an incredible ability

00:08:30.952 --> 00:08:32.657
to develop muscle memory.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.810
Now, she's the fastest typist she knows.

00:08:35.834 --> 00:08:37.298
(Laughter)

00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:40.559
Before becoming a writer,
Nora was a financial planner.

00:08:40.583 --> 00:08:42.789
She had to learn
the finer mechanics of sales

00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:44.559
when she was starting her practice,

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:48.552
and this skill now helps her
write compelling pitches to editors.

00:08:49.727 --> 00:08:53.597
It is rarely a waste of time
to pursue something you're drawn to,

00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:55.311
even if you end up quitting.

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:58.639
You might apply that knowledge
in a different field entirely,

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.270
in a way that you couldn't
have anticipated.

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:05.414
The third multipotentialite superpower

00:09:05.438 --> 00:09:07.285
is adaptability;

00:09:07.309 --> 00:09:10.852
that is, the ability to morph
into whatever you need to be

00:09:10.876 --> 00:09:12.652
in a given situation.

00:09:14.295 --> 00:09:19.186
Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director,
sometimes a web designer,

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.923
sometimes a Kickstarter consultant,
sometimes a teacher,

00:09:22.947 --> 00:09:25.338
and sometimes, apparently, James Bond.

00:09:25.362 --> 00:09:27.052
(Laughter)

00:09:27.076 --> 00:09:29.544
He's valuable because he does good work.

00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:32.829
He's even more valuable
because he can take on various roles,

00:09:32.853 --> 00:09:35.015
depending on his clients' needs.

00:09:35.737 --> 00:09:38.975
Fast Company magazine
identified adaptability

00:09:38.999 --> 00:09:42.354
as the single most important skill
to develop in order to thrive

00:09:42.378 --> 00:09:44.030
in the 21st century.

00:09:44.808 --> 00:09:48.023
The economic world is changing
so quickly and unpredictably

00:09:48.047 --> 00:09:51.818
that it is the individuals
and organizations that can pivot

00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:55.774
in order to meet the needs of the market
that are really going to thrive.

00:09:57.615 --> 00:10:01.906
Idea synthesis, rapid learning
and adaptability:

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.853
three skills that multipotentialites
are very adept at,

00:10:05.877 --> 00:10:10.403
and three skills that they might lose
if pressured to narrow their focus.

00:10:13.181 --> 00:10:17.637
As a society, we have a vested interest
in encouraging multipotentialites

00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:19.335
to be themselves.

00:10:20.073 --> 00:10:24.000
We have a lot of complex, multidimensional
problems in the world right now,

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:27.801
and we need creative,
out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.474
Now, let's say that you are,
in your heart, a specialist.

00:10:34.498 --> 00:10:38.919
You came out of the womb knowing
you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon.

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:42.694
Don't worry -- there's nothing
wrong with you, either.

00:10:42.718 --> 00:10:43.758
(Laughter)

00:10:43.782 --> 00:10:46.825
In fact, some of the best teams
are comprised of a specialist

00:10:46.849 --> 00:10:49.456
and multipotentialite paired together.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.514
The specialist can dive in deep
and implement ideas,

00:10:52.538 --> 00:10:56.140
while the multipotentialite brings
a breadth of knowledge to the project.

00:10:56.164 --> 00:10:58.066
It's a beautiful partnership.

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:01.535
But we should all be designing
lives and careers

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:04.068
that are aligned with how we're wired.

00:11:04.092 --> 00:11:08.510
And sadly, multipotentialites
are largely being encouraged

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:11.542
simply to be more
like their specialist peers.

00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:15.100
So with that said,

00:11:15.124 --> 00:11:18.195
if there is one thing
you take away from this talk,

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:21.317
I hope that it is this:

00:11:21.341 --> 00:11:24.703
embrace your inner wiring,
whatever that may be.

00:11:25.687 --> 00:11:27.855
If you're a specialist at heart,

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:29.878
then by all means, specialize.

00:11:29.902 --> 00:11:32.099
That is where you'll do your best work.

00:11:32.624 --> 00:11:35.604
But to the multipotentialites in the room,

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:37.945
including those of you
who may have just realized

00:11:37.969 --> 00:11:39.985
in the last 12 minutes that you are one --

00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:41.614
(Laughter)

00:11:41.638 --> 00:11:43.790
to you I say:

00:11:43.814 --> 00:11:45.916
embrace your many passions.

00:11:46.614 --> 00:11:49.897
Follow your curiosity
down those rabbit holes.

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:52.667
Explore your intersections.

00:11:54.264 --> 00:11:59.026
Embracing our inner wiring leads
to a happier, more authentic life.

00:12:00.028 --> 00:12:02.745
And perhaps more importantly --

00:12:02.769 --> 00:12:06.568
multipotentialites, the world needs us.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:09.013
Thank you.

00:12:09.037 --> 00:12:11.730
(Applause)
