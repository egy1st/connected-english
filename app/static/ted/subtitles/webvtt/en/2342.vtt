00:00:01.936 --> 00:00:06.317
Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells?

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.237
There's still some confusion
about that question,

00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:12.871
as this is a fairly new field of research.

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.928
For example, I was talking
to one of my colleagues, Robert,

00:00:16.952 --> 00:00:18.260
who is an oncologist,

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.585
and he was telling me,

00:00:20.014 --> 00:00:21.769
"Sandrine, this is puzzling.

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:26.107
Some of my patients that have been told
they are cured of their cancer

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:28.528
still develop symptoms of depression."

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.815
And I responded to him,

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.179
"Well, from my point of view
that makes sense.

00:00:33.203 --> 00:00:37.741
The drug you give to your patients
that stops the cancer cells multiplying

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:42.868
also stops the newborn neurons
being generated in their brain."

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.606
And then Robert looked at me
like I was crazy and said,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.812
"But Sandrine, these are adult patients --

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:51.408
adults do not grow new nerve cells."

00:00:52.543 --> 00:00:56.209
And much to his surprise, I said,
"Well actually, we do."

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:01.924
And this is a phenomenon
that we call neurogenesis.

00:01:01.948 --> 00:01:03.138
[Neurogenesis]

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:06.932
Now Robert is not a neuroscientist,

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:11.581
and when he went to medical school
he was not taught what we know now --

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:15.344
that the adult brain
can generate new nerve cells.

00:01:17.217 --> 00:01:21.587
So Robert, you know,
being the good doctor that he is,

00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:23.310
wanted to come to my lab

00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:26.158
to understand the topic
a little bit better.

00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:29.136
And I took him for a tour

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.073
of one of the most exciting
parts of the brain

00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:34.270
when it comes to neurogenesis --

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.382
and this is the hippocampus.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.932
So this is this gray structure
in the center of the brain.

00:01:41.613 --> 00:01:44.035
And what we've known already
for very long,

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:48.824
is that this is important for learning,
memory, mood and emotion.

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:52.390
However, what we
have learned more recently

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:57.072
is that this is one of the unique
structures of the adult brain

00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:59.746
where new neurons can be generated.

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:02.716
And if we slice through the hippocampus

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.008
and zoom in,

00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:06.833
what you actually see here in blue

00:02:06.857 --> 00:02:11.430
is a newborn neuron
in an adult mouse brain.

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.824
So when it comes to the human brain --

00:02:15.848 --> 00:02:19.380
my colleague Jonas FrisÃ©n
from the Karolinska Institutet,

00:02:19.404 --> 00:02:25.144
has estimated that we produce
700 new neurons per day

00:02:25.168 --> 00:02:26.366
in the hippocampus.

00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:28.858
You might think this is not much,

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.271
compared to the billions
of neurons we have.

00:02:31.644 --> 00:02:34.715
But by the time we turn 50,

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.415
we will have all exchanged the neurons
we were born with in that structure

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.654
with adult-born neurons.

00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:48.284
So why are these new neurons important
and what are their functions?

00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:53.022
First, we know that they're important
for learning and memory.

00:02:53.046 --> 00:02:54.563
And in the lab we have shown

00:02:54.587 --> 00:02:57.823
that if we block the ability
of the adult brain

00:02:57.847 --> 00:03:00.407
to produce new neurons in the hippocampus,

00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.947
then we block certain memory abilities.

00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:10.633
And this is especially new and true
for spatial recognition --

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.455
so like, how you navigate
your way in the city.

00:03:14.181 --> 00:03:15.659
We are still learning a lot,

00:03:15.683 --> 00:03:18.746
and neurons are not only important
for memory capacity,

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.673
but also for the quality of the memory.

00:03:21.697 --> 00:03:25.742
And they will have been helpful
to add time to our memory

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:30.448
and they will help differentiate
very similar memories, like:

00:03:30.472 --> 00:03:32.552
how do you find your bike

00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:36.092
that you park at the station
every day in the same area,

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:38.258
but in a slightly different position?

00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:42.552
And more interesting
to my colleague Robert

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:47.438
is the research we have been doing
on neurogenesis and depression.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.948
So in an animal model of depression,

00:03:49.972 --> 00:03:53.976
we have seen that we have
a lower level of neurogenesis.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.743
And if we give antidepressants,

00:03:56.767 --> 00:04:00.221
then we increase the production
of these newborn neurons,

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:03.388
and we decrease
the symptoms of depression,

00:04:03.412 --> 00:04:08.872
establishing a clear link
between neurogenesis and depression.

00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:13.500
But moreover, if you
just block neurogenesis,

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:16.357
then you block the efficacy
of the antidepressant.

00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:19.477
So by then, Robert had understood

00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:23.199
that very likely his patients
were suffering from depression

00:04:23.223 --> 00:04:25.818
even after being cured of their cancer,

00:04:25.842 --> 00:04:30.223
because the cancer drug had stopped
newborn neurons from being generated.

00:04:30.247 --> 00:04:33.875
And it will take time
to generate new neurons

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.105
that reach normal functions.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.189
So, collectively, now we think
we have enough evidence

00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:45.928
to say that neurogenesis
is a target of choice

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.566
if we want to improve
memory formation or mood,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.153
or even prevent the decline
associated with aging,

00:04:53.177 --> 00:04:55.311
or associated with stress.

00:04:56.288 --> 00:04:58.019
So the next question is:

00:04:58.043 --> 00:05:00.217
can we control neurogenesis?

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:02.257
The answer is yes.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.423
And we are now going to do a little quiz.

00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:09.382
I'm going to give you a set
of behaviors and activities,

00:05:09.406 --> 00:05:14.090
and you tell me if you think
they will increase neurogenesis

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:16.280
or if they will decrease neurogenesis.

00:05:16.804 --> 00:05:17.963
Are we ready?

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.709
OK, let's go.

00:05:20.034 --> 00:05:21.621
So what about learning?

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:23.701
Increasing?

00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:24.884
Yes.

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:28.694
Learning will increase the production
of these new neurons.

00:05:28.718 --> 00:05:30.034
How about stress?

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:36.168
Yes, stress will decrease the production
of new neurons in the hippocampus.

00:05:36.192 --> 00:05:37.804
How about sleep deprivation?

00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:42.074
Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.

00:05:42.098 --> 00:05:43.319
How about sex?

00:05:44.414 --> 00:05:45.566
Oh, wow!

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.857
(Laughter)

00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:50.634
Yes, you are right, it will increase
the production of new neurons.

00:05:50.658 --> 00:05:52.810
However, it's all about balance here.

00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:55.047
We don't want to fall in a situation --

00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:56.999
(Laughter)

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.857
about too much sex
leading to sleep deprivation.

00:05:59.881 --> 00:06:02.110
(Laughter)

00:06:02.753 --> 00:06:04.944
How about getting older?

00:06:07.645 --> 00:06:11.328
So the neurogenesis rate
will decrease as we get older,

00:06:11.352 --> 00:06:13.098
but it is still occurring.

00:06:14.042 --> 00:06:16.233
And then finally, how about running?

00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:20.721
I will let you judge that one by yourself.

00:06:21.563 --> 00:06:23.359
So this is one of the first studies

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:27.786
that was carried out by one of my mentors,
Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.084
showing that the environment
can have an impact

00:06:30.108 --> 00:06:31.997
on the production of new neurons.

00:06:32.021 --> 00:06:36.275
And here you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:38.544
that had no running wheel in its cage.

00:06:38.568 --> 00:06:42.603
And the little black dots you see
are actually newborn neurons-to-be.

00:06:43.246 --> 00:06:48.384
And now, you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.004
that had a running wheel in its cage.

00:06:51.028 --> 00:06:52.551
So you see the massive increase

00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:55.388
of the black dots representing
the new neurons-to-be.

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.612
So activity impacts neurogenesis,
but that's not all.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.286
What you eat will have an effect

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.224
on the production of new neurons
in the hippocampus.

00:07:07.248 --> 00:07:10.208
So here we have a sample of diet --

00:07:10.232 --> 00:07:13.509
of nutrients that have been shown
to have efficacy.

00:07:13.973 --> 00:07:16.568
And I'm just going
to point a few out to you:

00:07:16.592 --> 00:07:21.686
Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:22.128 --> 00:07:25.610
Intermittent fasting --
spacing the time between your meals --

00:07:25.634 --> 00:07:27.773
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:29.120
Intake of flavonoids,

00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:32.147
which are contained
in dark chocolate or blueberries,

00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:33.994
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:34.355 --> 00:07:35.861
Omega-3 fatty acids,

00:07:35.885 --> 00:07:38.096
present in fatty fish, like salmon,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.558
will increase the production
of these new neurons.

00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:45.603
Conversely, a diet rich
in high saturated fat

00:07:45.627 --> 00:07:48.367
will have a negative impact
on neurogenesis.

00:07:49.232 --> 00:07:53.414
Ethanol -- intake of alcohol --
will decrease neurogenesis.

00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:56.703
However, not everything is lost;

00:07:56.727 --> 00:07:59.779
resveratrol, which is
contained in red wine,

00:07:59.803 --> 00:08:03.294
has been shown to promote
the survival of these new neurons.

00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:05.574
So next time you are at a dinner party,

00:08:05.598 --> 00:08:09.602
you might want to reach for this possibly
"neurogenesis-neutral" drink.

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:12.042
(Laughter)

00:08:12.066 --> 00:08:14.567
And then finally,
let me point out the last one --

00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:15.749
a quirky one.

00:08:15.773 --> 00:08:19.668
So Japanese groups are fascinated
with food textures,

00:08:19.692 --> 00:08:24.995
and they have shown that actually
soft diet impairs neurogenesis,

00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:29.740
as opposed to food that requires
mastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food.

00:08:30.827 --> 00:08:32.620
So all of this data,

00:08:32.644 --> 00:08:35.225
where we need to look
at the cellular level,

00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:37.756
has been generated using animal models.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.851
But this diet has also been given
to human participants,

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:49.033
and what we could see is that
the diet modulates memory and mood

00:08:49.057 --> 00:08:52.541
in the same direction
as it modulates neurogenesis,

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:57.322
such as: calorie restriction
will improve memory capacity,

00:08:57.346 --> 00:09:02.445
whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate
symptoms of depression --

00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:06.333
as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids,
which increase neurogenesis,

00:09:06.357 --> 00:09:10.540
and also help to decrease
the symptoms of depression.

00:09:11.643 --> 00:09:16.460
So we think that the effect of diet

00:09:16.484 --> 00:09:20.079
on mental health, on memory and mood,

00:09:20.103 --> 00:09:24.575
is actually mediated by the production
of the new neurons in the hippocampus.

00:09:24.994 --> 00:09:26.914
And it's not only what you eat,

00:09:26.938 --> 00:09:30.003
but it's also the texture
of the food, when you eat it

00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:31.851
and how much of it you eat.

00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:37.874
On our side -- neuroscientists
interested in neurogenesis --

00:09:37.898 --> 00:09:41.563
we need to understand better
the function of these new neurons,

00:09:41.587 --> 00:09:45.571
and how we can control their survival
and their production.

00:09:45.896 --> 00:09:50.435
We also need to find a way to protect
the neurogenesis of Robert's patients.

00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:52.648
And on your side --

00:09:52.672 --> 00:09:55.102
I leave you in charge
of your neurogenesis.

00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:56.849
Thank you.

00:09:56.873 --> 00:10:02.832
(Applause)

00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:05.188
Margaret Heffernan:
Fantastic research, Sandrine.

00:10:05.212 --> 00:10:07.457
Now, I told you you changed my life --

00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:09.259
I now eat a lot of blueberries.

00:10:09.283 --> 00:10:10.830
Sandrine Thuret: Very good.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.972
MH: I'm really interested
in the running thing.

00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:16.520
Do I have to run?

00:10:17.368 --> 00:10:20.010
Or is it really just
about aerobic exercise,

00:10:20.034 --> 00:10:21.639
getting oxygen to the brain?

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.798
Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise?

00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:25.838
ST: So for the moment,

00:10:25.862 --> 00:10:29.102
we can't really say
if it's just the running itself,

00:10:29.126 --> 00:10:34.163
but we think that anything that indeed
will increase the production --

00:10:34.187 --> 00:10:37.267
or moving the blood flow to the brain,

00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:38.893
should be beneficial.

00:10:39.353 --> 00:10:41.980
MH: So I don't have to get
a running wheel in my office?

00:10:42.004 --> 00:10:43.167
ST: No, you don't!

00:10:43.191 --> 00:10:45.284
