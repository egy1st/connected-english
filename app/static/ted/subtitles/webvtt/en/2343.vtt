00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.936
I want to talk to you
about the future of medicine.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.056
But before I do that, I want to talk
a little bit about the past.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.696
Now, throughout much
of the recent history of medicine,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.536
we've thought about illness and treatment

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.936
in terms of a profoundly simple model.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.656
In fact, the model is so simple

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.736
that you could summarize it in six words:

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.840
have disease, take pill, kill something.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.816
Now, the reason
for the dominance of this model

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.456
is of course the antibiotic revolution.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.656
Many of you might not know this,
but we happen to be celebrating

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.736
the hundredth year of the introduction
of antibiotics into the United States.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.376
But what you do know

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.640
is that that introduction
was nothing short of transformative.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.736
Here you had a chemical,
either from the natural world

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.496
or artificially synthesized
in the laboratory,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.776
and it would course through your body,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.576
it would find its target,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.256
lock into its target --

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.496
a microbe or some part of a microbe --

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.960
and then turn off a lock and a key

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.496
with exquisite deftness,
exquisite specificity.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.816
And you would end up taking
a previously fatal, lethal disease --

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.976
a pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.040
and transforming that
into a curable, or treatable illness.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.560
You have a pneumonia,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.856
you take penicillin,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.416
you kill the microbe

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.576
and you cure the disease.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.536
So seductive was this idea,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.736
so potent the metaphor of lock and key

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.296
and killing something,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.336
that it really swept through biology.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480
It was a transformation like no other.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.336
And we've really spent the last 100 years

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.816
trying to replicate that model
over and over again

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.079
in noninfectious diseases,

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:04.223
in chronic diseases like diabetes
and hypertension and heart disease.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.759
And it's worked,
but it's only worked partly.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.776
Let me show you.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.696
You know, if you take the entire universe

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.216
of all chemical reactions
in the human body,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.536
every chemical reaction
that your body is capable of,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.576
most people think that that number
is on the order of a million.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.896
Let's call it a million.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.616
And now you ask the question,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.296
what number or fraction of reactions

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.136
can actually be targeted

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.976
by the entire pharmacopoeia,
all of medicinal chemistry?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.040
That number is 250.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.216
The rest is chemical darkness.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.416
In other words, 0.025 percent
of all chemical reactions in your body

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.560
are actually targetable
by this lock and key mechanism.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.736
You know, if you think
about human physiology

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.216
as a vast global telephone network

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.120
with interacting nodes
and interacting pieces,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.776
then all of our medicinal chemistry

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.056
is operating on one tiny corner

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.776
at the edge, the outer edge,
of that network.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.616
It's like all of our
pharmaceutical chemistry

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.416
is a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.400
who is tinkering with about
10 or 15 telephone lines.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.040
So what do we do about this idea?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.520
What if we reorganized this approach?

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.456
In fact, it turns out
that the natural world

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.536
gives us a sense of how one
might think about illness

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.216
in a radically different way,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.960
rather than disease, medicine, target.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.456
In fact, the natural world
is organized hierarchically upwards,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.336
not downwards, but upwards,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.600
and we begin with a self-regulating,
semi-autonomous unit called a cell.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.856
These self-regulating,
semi-autonomous units

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.696
give rise to self-regulating,
semi-autonomous units called organs,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.720
and these organs coalesce
to form things called humans,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.816
and these organisms
ultimately live in environments,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.440
which are partly self-regulating
and partly semi-autonomous.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.736
What's nice about this scheme,
this hierarchical scheme

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.456
building upwards rather than downwards,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.856
is that it allows us
to think about illness as well

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.214
in a somewhat different way.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.520
Take a disease like cancer.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.416
Since the 1950s,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.967
we've tried rather desperately to apply
this lock and key model to cancer.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.880
We've tried to kill cells

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:50.252
using a variety of chemotherapies 
or targeted therapies,

00:04:50.276 --> 00:04:52.696
and as most of us know, that's worked.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.578
It's worked for diseases like leukemia.

00:04:54.602 --> 00:04:56.976
It's worked for some forms
of breast cancer,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.736
but eventually you run
to the ceiling of that approach.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.256
And it's only in the last 10 years or so

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.416
that we've begun to think
about using the immune system,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.536
remembering that in fact the cancer cell
doesn't grow in a vacuum.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.616
It actually grows in a human organism.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.936
And could you use the organismal capacity,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.103
the fact that human beings
have an immune system, to attack cancer?

00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:21.327
In fact, it's led to the some of the most
spectacular new medicines in cancer.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.814
And finally there's the level
of the environment, isn't there?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.136
You know, we don't think of cancer
as altering the environment.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.056
But let me give you an example
of a profoundly carcinogenic environment.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.280
It's called a prison.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.296
You take loneliness, you take depression,
you take confinement,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.520
and you add to that,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.960
rolled up in a little
white sheet of paper,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.776
one of the most potent neurostimulants
that we know, called nicotine,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.736
and you add to that one of the most potent
addictive substances that you know,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.556
and you have
a pro-carcinogenic environment.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.976
But you can have anti-carcinogenic
environments too.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.696
There are attempts to create milieus,

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.482
change the hormonal milieu
for breast cancer, for instance.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.856
We're trying to change the metabolic
milieu for other forms of cancer.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.296
Or take another disease, like depression.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.976
Again, working upwards,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.016
since the 1960s and 1970s,
we've tried, again, desperately

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.216
to turn off molecules
that operate between nerve cells --

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.416
serotonin, dopamine --

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.256
and tried to cure depression that way,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.720
and that's worked,
but then that reached the limit.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.620
And we now know that what you
really probably need to do

00:06:35.644 --> 00:06:38.616
is to change the physiology
of the organ, the brain,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.776
rewire it, remodel it,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.376
and that, of course,
we know study upon study has shown

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.115
that talk therapy does exactly that,

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.395
and study upon study
has shown that talk therapy

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.536
combined with medicines, pills,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.989
really is much more effective
than either one alone.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.416
Can we imagine a more immersive
environment that will change depression?

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.496
Can you lock out the signals
that elicit depression?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.000
Again, moving upwards along this
hierarchical chain of organization.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.456
What's really at stake perhaps here

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.736
is not the medicine itself but a metaphor.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.816
Rather than killing something,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.536
in the case of the great
chronic degenerative diseases --

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.056
kidney failure, diabetes,
hypertension, osteoarthritis --

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.652
maybe what we really need to do is change
the metaphor to growing something.

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:28.616
And that's the key, perhaps,

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.136
to reframing our thinking about medicine.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.616
Now, this idea of changing,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.976
of creating a perceptual
shift, as it were,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.296
came home to me to roost in a very
personal manner about 10 years ago.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.096
About 10 years ago --
I've been a runner most of my life --

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.096
I went for a run, a Saturday morning run,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.776
I came back and woke up
and I basically couldn't move.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.816
My right knee was swollen up,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.360
and you could hear that ominous crunch
of bone against bone.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.136
And one of the perks of being a physician
is that you get to order your own MRIs.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.136
And I had an MRI the next week,
and it looked like that.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.456
Essentially, the meniscus of cartilage
that is between bone

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.896
had been completely torn
and the bone itself had been shattered.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.376
Now, if you're looking at me
and feeling sorry,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.216
let me tell you a few facts.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.416
If I was to take an MRI
of every person in this audience,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.496
60 percent of you would show signs

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.296
of bone degeneration
and cartilage degeneration like this.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.096
85 percent of all women by the age of 70

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.376
would show moderate to severe
cartilage degeneration.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.696
50 to 60 percent
of the men in this audience

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.056
would also have such signs.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.856
So this is a very common disease.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.976
Well, the second perk of being a physician

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.135
is that you can get
to experiment on your own ailments.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.376
So about 10 years ago we began,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.816
we brought this process
into the laboratory,

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.856
and we began to do simple experiments,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.336
mechanically trying
to fix this degeneration.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.176
We tried to inject chemicals
into the knee spaces of animals

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.856
to try to reverse cartilage degeneration,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.416
and to put a short summary
on a very long and painful process,

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.216
essentially it came to naught.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.440
Nothing happened.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.656
And then about seven years ago,
we had a research student from Australia.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.205
The nice thing about Australians

00:09:13.205 --> 00:09:16.521
is that they're habitually used to
looking at the world upside down.

00:09:16.546 --> 00:09:17.703
(Laughter)

00:09:17.727 --> 00:09:21.816
And so Dan suggested to me, "You know,
maybe it isn't a mechanical problem.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.840
Maybe it isn't a chemical problem.
Maybe it's a stem cell problem."

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.656
In other words, he had two hypotheses.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.496
Number one, there is such a thing
as a skeletal stem cell --

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.040
a skeletal stem cell that builds up
the entire vertebrate skeleton,

00:09:37.064 --> 00:09:39.596
bone, cartilage and the fibrous
elements of skeleton,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.485
just like there's a stem cell in blood,

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.945
just like there's a stem cell
in the nervous system.

00:09:43.969 --> 00:09:47.529
And two, that maybe that, the degeneration
or dysfunction of this stem cell

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:51.056
is what's causing osteochondral arthritis,
a very common ailment.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.296
So really the question was,
were we looking for a pill

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.936
when we should have really
been looking for a cell.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.816
So we switched our models,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.960
and now we began
to look for skeletal stem cells.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.056
And to cut again a long story short,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.000
about five years ago,
we found these cells.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.296
They live inside the skeleton.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.216
Here's a schematic and then
a real photograph of one of them.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.176
The white stuff is bone,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.216
and these red columns that you see
and the yellow cells

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.496
are cells that have arisen
from one single skeletal stem cell --

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.816
columns of cartilage, columns of bone
coming out of a single cell.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.136
These cells are fascinating.
They have four properties.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.936
Number one is that they live
where they're expected to live.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.336
They live just underneath
the surface of the bone,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.896
underneath cartilage.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.540
You know, in biology,
it's location, location, location.

00:10:40.564 --> 00:10:44.816
And they move into the appropriate areas
and form bone and cartilage.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.096
That's one.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.656
Here's an interesting property.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.336
You can take them out
of the vertebrate skeleton,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.936
you can culture them
in petri dishes in the laboratory,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.936
and they are dying to form cartilage.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.682
Remember how we couldn't
form cartilage for love or money?

00:10:57.706 --> 00:10:59.625
These cells are dying to form cartilage.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.655
They form their own furls
of cartilage around themselves.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.296
They're also, number three,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.496
the most efficient repairers
of fractures that we've ever encountered.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.816
This is a little bone,
a mouse bone that we fractured

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.376
and then let it heal by itself.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.416
These stem cells have come in
and repaired, in yellow, the bone,

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.056
in white, the cartilage,
almost completely.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.616
So much so that if you label them
with a fluorescent dye

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.376
you can see them like some kind
of peculiar cellular glue

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.256
coming into the area of a fracture,

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.256
fixing it locally
and then stopping their work.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.616
Now, the fourth one is the most ominous,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.776
and that is that their numbers
decline precipitously,

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.496
precipitously, tenfold,
fiftyfold, as you age.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.096
And so what had happened, really,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.976
is that we found ourselves
in a perceptual shift.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.736
We had gone hunting for pills

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.256
but we ended up finding theories.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.496
And in some ways

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.136
we had hooked ourselves
back onto this idea:

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.056
cells, organisms, environments,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.656
because we were now thinking
about bone stem cells,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.120
we were thinking about arthritis
in terms of a cellular disease.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.126
And then the next question was,
are there organs?

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.389
Can you build this
as an organ outside the body?

00:12:10.413 --> 00:12:14.256
Can you implant cartilage
into areas of trauma?

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.256
And perhaps most interestingly,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.656
can you ascend right up
and create environments?

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.736
You know, we know
that exercise remodels bone,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.176
but come on, none of us
is going to exercise.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.376
So could you imagine ways of passively
loading and unloading bone

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.216
so that you can recreate
or regenerate degenerating cartilage?

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.621
And perhaps more interesting,
and more importantly,

00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:40.096
the question is, can you apply this model
more globally outside medicine?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.176
What's at stake, as I said before,
is not killing something,

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.640
but growing something.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.096
And it raises a series of, I think,
some of the most interesting questions

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.640
about how we think
about medicine in the future.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.920
Could your medicine
be a cell and not a pill?

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.216
How would we grow these cells?

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.256
What we would we do to stop
the malignant growth of these cells?

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.176
We heard about the problems
of unleashing growth.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.976
Could we implant
suicide genes into these cells

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.440
to stop them from growing?

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.976
Could your medicine be an organ
that's created outside the body

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.936
and then implanted into the body?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.696
Could that stop some of the degeneration?

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.625
What if the organ needed to have memory?

00:13:23.649 --> 00:13:28.416
In cases of diseases of the nervous system
some of those organs had memory.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.896
How could we implant
those memories back in?

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.736
Could we store these organs?

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.903
Would each organ have to be developed
for an individual human being

00:13:35.927 --> 00:13:37.127
and put back?

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.136
And perhaps most puzzlingly,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.970
could your medicine be an environment?

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.816
Could you patent an environment?

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.296
You know, in every culture,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.256
shamans have been using
environments as medicines.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.600
Could we imagine that for our future?

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.456
I've talked a lot about models.
I began this talk with models.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.176
So let me end with some thoughts
about model building.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.296
That's what we do as scientists.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.616
You know, when an architect
builds a model,

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.936
he or she is trying to show you
a world in miniature.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.856
But when a scientist is building a model,

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.404
he or she is trying to show you
the world in metaphor.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.456
He or she is trying to create
a new way of seeing.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.600
The former is a scale shift.
The latter is a perceptual shift.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.856
Now, antibiotics created
such a perceptual shift

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.696
in our way of thinking about medicine
that it really colored, distorted,

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.640
very successfully, the way we've thought
about medicine for the last hundred years.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.816
But we need new models
to think about medicine in the future.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.320
That's what's at stake.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.816
You know, there's
a popular trope out there

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.816
that the reason we haven't had
the transformative impact

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.816
on the treatment of illness

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.696
is because we don't have
powerful-enough drugs,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.080
and that's partly true.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.616
But perhaps the real reason is

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.840
that we don't have powerful-enough
ways of thinking about medicines.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.976
It's certainly true that

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.776
it would be lovely to have new medicines.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.456
But perhaps what's really at stake
are three more intangible M's:

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.296
mechanisms, models, metaphors.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.656
Thank you.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:31.520
(Applause)

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.016
Chris Anderson:
I really like this metaphor.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.576
How does it link in?

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.736
There's a lot of talk in technologyland

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.896
about the personalization of medicine,

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.336
that we have all this data
and that medical treatments of the future

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.856
will be for you specifically,
your genome, your current context.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.816
Does that apply to this model
you've got here?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.456
Siddhartha Mukherjee:
It's a very interesting question.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.696
We've thought about
personalization of medicine

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.256
very much in terms of genomics.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.856
That's because the gene
is such a dominant metaphor,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.856
again, to use that same word,
in medicine today,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.616
that we think the genome will drive
the personalization of medicine.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.736
But of course the genome
is just the bottom

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.576
of a long chain of being, as it were.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.416
That chain of being, really the first
organized unit of that, is the cell.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.416
So, if we are really going to deliver
in medicine in this way,

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.256
we have to think of personalizing
cellular therapies,

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.456
and then personalizing
organ or organismal therapies,

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.296
and ultimately personalizing
immersion therapies for the environment.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.416
So I think at every stage, you know --

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.856
there's that metaphor,
there's turtles all the way.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.261
Well, in this, there's
personalization all the way.

00:16:43.285 --> 00:16:46.176
CA: So when you say
medicine could be a cell

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.016
and not a pill,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.296
you're talking about
potentially your own cells.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.696
SM: Absolutely.
CA: So converted to stem cells,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.256
perhaps tested against all kinds
of drugs or something, and prepared.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.816
SM: And there's no perhaps.
This is what we're doing.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.576
This is what's happening,
and in fact, we're slowly moving,

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.415
not away from genomics,
but incorporating genomics

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.175
into what we call multi-order,
semi-autonomous, self-regulating systems,

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.816
like cells, like organs,
like environments.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.207
CA: Thank you so much.

00:17:16.227 --> 00:17:17.517
SM: Pleasure. Thanks.
