00:00:01.037 --> 00:00:03.684
Two twin domes,

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:07.138
two radically opposed design cultures.

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.749
One is made of thousands of steel parts,

00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:13.549
the other of a single silk thread.

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:16.501
One is synthetic, the other organic.

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:19.213
One is imposed on the environment,

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:21.330
the other creates it.

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.300
One is designed for nature,
the other is designed by her.

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:28.925
Michelangelo said that
when he looked at raw marble,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.401
he saw a figure struggling to be free.

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:35.547
The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool.

00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:39.445
But living things are not chiseled.

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:41.183
They grow.

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:47.465
And in our smallest units of life,
our cells, we carry all the information

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.857
that's required for every other cell
to function and to replicate.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:56.384
Tools also have consequences.

00:00:56.922 --> 00:01:01.532
At least since the Industrial Revolution,
the world of design has been dominated

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:04.227
by the rigors of manufacturing
and mass production.

00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:07.975
Assembly lines have dictated
a world made of parts,

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:10.591
framing the imagination
of designers and architects

00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:13.719
who have been trained to think
about their objects as assemblies

00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:17.117
of discrete parts with distinct functions.

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:22.855
But you don't find homogenous
material assemblies in nature.

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:25.688
Take human skin, for example.

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:29.622
Our facial skins are thin
with large pores.

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.082
Our back skins are thicker,
with small pores.

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:36.177
One acts mainly as filter,

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:37.965
the other mainly as barrier,

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:42.257
and yet it's the same skin:
no parts, no assemblies.

00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:45.646
It's a system that gradually
varies its functionality

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.351
by varying elasticity.

00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:51.777
So here this is a split screen
to represent my split world view,

00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:56.205
the split personality of every designer
and architect operating today

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.548
between the chisel and the gene,

00:01:58.572 --> 00:02:03.410
between machine and organism,
between assembly and growth,

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:05.972
between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:09.736
These two worldviews,
my left brain and right brain,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.405
analysis and synthesis, will play out
on the two screens behind me.

00:02:17.754 --> 00:02:20.200
My work, at its simplest level,

00:02:20.224 --> 00:02:22.959
is about uniting these two worldviews,

00:02:22.983 --> 00:02:25.197
moving away from assembly

00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:28.259
and closer into growth.

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.211
You're probably asking yourselves:

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:32.385
Why now?

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:36.547
Why was this not possible 10
or even five years ago?

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.579
We live in a very special time in history,

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:42.675
a rare time,

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:47.278
a time when the confluence of four fields
is giving designers access to tools

00:02:47.302 --> 00:02:49.552
we've never had access to before.

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:53.069
These fields are computational design,

00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:58.101
allowing us to design
complex forms with simple code;

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:02.159
additive manufacturing,
letting us produce parts

00:03:02.183 --> 00:03:05.809
by adding material
rather than carving it out;

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:09.277
materials engineering, which lets us
design the behavior of materials

00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:11.018
in high resolution;

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:12.899
and synthetic biology,

00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:16.999
enabling us to design new biological
functionality by editing DNA.

00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:19.731
And at the intersection
of these four fields,

00:03:19.755 --> 00:03:21.468
my team and I create.

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:23.897
Please meet the minds and hands

00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.317
of my students.

00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:33.433
We design objects and products
and structures and tools across scales,

00:03:33.457 --> 00:03:35.228
from the large-scale,

00:03:35.252 --> 00:03:38.768
like this robotic arm
with an 80-foot diameter reach

00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:42.926
with a vehicular base that will
one day soon print entire buildings,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.037
to nanoscale graphics made entirely
of genetically engineered microorganisms

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:48.441
that glow in the dark.

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.445
Here we've reimagined the mashrabiya,

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.842
an archetype of ancient
Arabic architecture,

00:03:54.866 --> 00:03:58.430
and created a screen where
every aperture is uniquely sized

00:03:58.454 --> 00:04:02.040
to shape the form of light and heat
moving through it.

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.715
In our next project,

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.949
we explore the possibility
of creating a cape and skirt --

00:04:07.973 --> 00:04:11.163
this was for a Paris fashion show
with Iris van Herpen --

00:04:11.187 --> 00:04:13.975
like a second skin
that are made of a single part,

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:17.049
stiff at the contours,
flexible around the waist.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.789
Together with my long-term
3D printing collaborator Stratasys,

00:04:21.813 --> 00:04:26.820
we 3D-printed this cape and skirt
with no seams between the cells,

00:04:26.844 --> 00:04:28.840
and I'll show more objects like it.

00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:32.865
This helmet combines
stiff and soft materials

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.001
in 20-micron resolution.

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.413
This is the resolution of a human hair.

00:04:38.437 --> 00:04:41.023
It's also the resolution of a CT scanner.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.072
That designers have access

00:04:43.096 --> 00:04:47.494
to such high-resolution
analytic and synthetic tools,

00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:52.080
enables to design products that fit
not only the shape of our bodies,

00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:55.612
but also the physiological
makeup of our tissues.

00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:58.453
Next, we designed an acoustic chair,

00:04:58.477 --> 00:05:01.689
a chair that would be at once
structural, comfortable

00:05:01.713 --> 00:05:04.037
and would also absorb sound.

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.975
Professor Carter, my collaborator, and I
turned to nature for inspiration,

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:11.684
and by designing this irregular
surface pattern,

00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:14.079
it becomes sound-absorbent.

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.559
We printed its surface
out of 44 different properties,

00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:21.976
varying in rigidity, opacity and color,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.999
corresponding to pressure points
on the human body.

00:05:26.023 --> 00:05:30.015
Its surface, as in nature,
varies its functionality

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.666
not by adding another material
or another assembly,

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.409
but by continuously and delicately
varying material property.

00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:42.313
But is nature ideal?

00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:46.288
Are there no parts in nature?

00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:52.456
I wasn't raised
in a religious Jewish home,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.636
but when I was young,

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.057
my grandmother used to tell me
stories from the Hebrew Bible,

00:05:57.081 --> 00:06:01.086
and one of them stuck with me and came
to define much of what I care about.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.118
As she recounts:

00:06:03.142 --> 00:06:06.085
"On the third day of Creation,
God commands the Earth

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:08.625
to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree."

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:11.876
For this first fruit tree,
there was to be no differentiation

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.270
between trunk, branches,
leaves and fruit.

00:06:16.294 --> 00:06:18.443
The whole tree was a fruit.

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.448
Instead, the land grew trees
that have bark and stems and flowers.

00:06:26.337 --> 00:06:29.710
The land created a world made of parts.

00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:32.372
I often ask myself,

00:06:32.396 --> 00:06:36.689
"What would design be like
if objects were made of a single part?

00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:40.849
Would we return to a better
state of creation?"

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:44.954
So we looked for that biblical material,

00:06:44.978 --> 00:06:49.631
that fruit-bearing fruit tree
kind of material, and we found it.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:55.250
The second-most abundant biopolymer
on the planet is called chitin,

00:06:55.274 --> 00:06:58.975
and some 100 million tons of it
are produced every year

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:02.855
by organisms such as shrimps,
crabs, scorpions and butterflies.

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.975
We thought if we could tune
its properties,

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:08.627
we could generate structures
that are multifunctional

00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:10.211
out of a single part.

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:11.979
So that's what we did.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.992
We called Legal Seafood --

00:07:15.016 --> 00:07:16.052
(Laughter)

00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:18.933
we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells,

00:07:18.957 --> 00:07:22.027
we grinded them
and we produced chitosan paste.

00:07:22.583 --> 00:07:24.547
By varying chemical concentrations,

00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:27.865
we were able to achieve
a wide array of properties --

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:29.666
from dark, stiff and opaque,

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.006
to light, soft and transparent.

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:35.629
In order to print the structures
in large scale,

00:07:35.653 --> 00:07:40.080
we built a robotically controlled
extrusion system with multiple nozzles.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.548
The robot would vary
material properties on the fly

00:07:43.572 --> 00:07:48.675
and create these 12-foot-long structures
made of a single material,

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:51.441
100 percent recyclable.

00:07:51.465 --> 00:07:54.139
When the parts are ready,
they're left to dry

00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:57.742
and find a form naturally
upon contact with air.

00:07:58.313 --> 00:08:02.242
So why are we still
designing with plastics?

00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:07.462
The air bubbles that were a byproduct
of the printing process

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:10.362
were used to contain
photosynthetic microorganisms

00:08:10.386 --> 00:08:13.259
that first appeared on our planet
3.5 billion year ago,

00:08:13.283 --> 00:08:14.845
as we learned yesterday.

00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:18.586
Together with our collaborators
at Harvard and MIT,

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.363
we embedded bacteria
that were genetically engineered

00:08:21.387 --> 00:08:24.529
to rapidly capture carbon
from the atmosphere

00:08:24.553 --> 00:08:26.560
and convert it into sugar.

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:29.236
For the first time,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.226
we were able to generate structures
that would seamlessly transition

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.584
from beam to mesh,

00:08:36.608 --> 00:08:39.003
and if scaled even larger, to windows.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.575
A fruit-bearing fruit tree.

00:08:42.626 --> 00:08:45.312
Working with an ancient material,

00:08:45.336 --> 00:08:47.975
one of the first lifeforms on the planet,

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:51.975
plenty of water and a little bit
of synthetic biology,

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:55.506
we were able to transform a structure
made of shrimp shells

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.097
into an architecture
that behaves like a tree.

00:08:59.724 --> 00:09:02.025
And here's the best part:

00:09:02.049 --> 00:09:03.996
for objects designed to biodegrade,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.931
put them in the sea,
and they will nourish marine life;

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.566
place them in soil,
and they will help grow a tree.

00:09:12.415 --> 00:09:16.432
The setting for our next exploration
using the same design principles

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:18.177
was the solar system.

00:09:18.693 --> 00:09:22.975
We looked for the possibility
of creating life-sustaining clothing

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:25.167
for interplanetary voyages.

00:09:26.707 --> 00:09:31.745
To do that, we needed to contain bacteria
and be able to control their flow.

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:36.329
So like the periodic table, we came up
with our own table of the elements:

00:09:36.353 --> 00:09:39.742
new lifeforms that
were computationally grown,

00:09:39.766 --> 00:09:41.807
additively manufactured

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.279
and biologically augmented.

00:09:46.096 --> 00:09:49.621
I like to think of synthetic biology
as liquid alchemy,

00:09:49.645 --> 00:09:52.384
only instead of transmuting
precious metals,

00:09:52.408 --> 00:09:56.147
you're synthesizing new biological
functionality inside very small channels.

00:09:56.171 --> 00:09:58.519
It's called microfluidics.

00:09:59.067 --> 00:10:03.242
We 3D-printed our own channels
in order to control the flow

00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:05.630
of these liquid bacterial cultures.

00:10:07.432 --> 00:10:11.433
In our first piece of clothing,
we combined two microorganisms.

00:10:11.457 --> 00:10:13.368
The first is cyanobacteria.

00:10:13.392 --> 00:10:16.368
It lives in our oceans
and in freshwater ponds.

00:10:16.392 --> 00:10:20.315
And the second, E. coli, the bacterium
that inhabits the human gut.

00:10:20.862 --> 00:10:24.435
One converts light into sugar,
the other consumes that sugar

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:27.808
and produces biofuels
useful for the built environment.

00:10:27.832 --> 00:10:32.319
Now, these two microorganisms
never interact in nature.

00:10:32.343 --> 00:10:34.201
In fact, they never met each other.

00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:37.404
They've been here,
engineered for the first time,

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:40.784
to have a relationship
inside a piece of clothing.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.975
Think of it as evolution
not by natural selection,

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:46.817
but evolution by design.

00:10:47.515 --> 00:10:49.714
In order to contain these relationships,

00:10:49.738 --> 00:10:53.843
we've created a single channel
that resembles the digestive tract,

00:10:53.867 --> 00:10:58.369
that will help flow these bacteria
and alter their function along the way.

00:10:58.822 --> 00:11:02.451
We then started growing
these channels on the human body,

00:11:02.475 --> 00:11:05.804
varying material properties
according to the desired functionality.

00:11:05.828 --> 00:11:10.358
Where we wanted more photosynthesis,
we would design more transparent channels.

00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:16.205
This wearable digestive system,
when it's stretched end to end,

00:11:16.229 --> 00:11:18.293
spans 60 meters.

00:11:18.317 --> 00:11:20.975
This is half the length
of a football field,

00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:24.348
and 10 times as long
as our small intestines.

00:11:25.612 --> 00:11:28.320
And here it is for the first time
unveiled at TED --

00:11:28.344 --> 00:11:30.447
our first photosynthetic wearable,

00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:34.091
liquid channels glowing with life
inside a wearable clothing.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.822
(Applause)

00:11:35.846 --> 00:11:38.895
Thank you.

00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:43.847
Mary Shelley said, "We are unfashioned
creatures, but only half made up."

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:47.752
What if design could provide
that other half?

00:11:47.776 --> 00:11:52.583
What if we could create structures
that would augment living matter?

00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:57.468
What if we could create
personal microbiomes

00:11:57.492 --> 00:12:01.367
that would scan our skins,
repair damaged tissue

00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:03.120
and sustain our bodies?

00:12:04.062 --> 00:12:06.975
Think of this as a form of edited biology.

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:10.975
This entire collection, Wanderers,
that was named after planets,

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:13.657
was not to me really about fashion per se,

00:12:13.681 --> 00:12:17.040
but it provided an opportunity
to speculate about the future

00:12:17.064 --> 00:12:19.686
of our race on our planet and beyond,

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.441
to combine scientific insight
with lots of mystery

00:12:23.465 --> 00:12:26.786
and to move away
from the age of the machine

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.286
to a new age of symbiosis
between our bodies,

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.749
the microorganisms that we inhabit,

00:12:32.773 --> 00:12:34.701
our products and even our buildings.

00:12:34.725 --> 00:12:37.567
I call this material ecology.

00:12:37.591 --> 00:12:42.168
To do this, we always need
to return back to nature.

00:12:42.999 --> 00:12:46.997
By now, you know that a 3D printer
prints material in layers.

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:49.671
You also know that nature doesn't.

00:12:50.182 --> 00:12:53.682
It grows. It adds with sophistication.

00:12:54.102 --> 00:12:56.666
This silkworm cocoon, for example,

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.010
creates a highly
sophisticated architecture,

00:13:00.034 --> 00:13:02.835
a home inside which to metamorphisize.

00:13:02.859 --> 00:13:08.511
No additive manufacturing today gets even
close to this level of sophistication.

00:13:08.535 --> 00:13:11.607
It does so by combining not two materials,

00:13:11.631 --> 00:13:14.940
but two proteins
in different concentrations.

00:13:15.487 --> 00:13:19.483
One acts as the structure,
the other is the glue, or the matrix,

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.928
holding those fibers together.

00:13:21.952 --> 00:13:23.712
And this happens across scales.

00:13:24.717 --> 00:13:27.449
The silkworm first attaches itself
to the environment --

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.489
it creates a tensile structure --

00:13:29.513 --> 00:13:32.610
and it then starts spinning
a compressive cocoon.

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:36.530
Tension and compression,
the two forces of life,

00:13:36.554 --> 00:13:39.608
manifested in a single material.

00:13:41.337 --> 00:13:44.548
In order to better understand
how this complex process works,

00:13:44.572 --> 00:13:46.759
we glued a tiny earth magnet

00:13:46.783 --> 00:13:49.782
to the head of a silkworm,
to the spinneret.

00:13:49.806 --> 00:13:52.754
We placed it inside a box
with magnetic sensors,

00:13:52.778 --> 00:13:55.865
and that allowed us to create
this 3-dimensional point cloud

00:13:55.889 --> 00:14:00.831
and visualize the complex architecture
of the silkworm cocoon.

00:14:01.736 --> 00:14:05.390
However, when we placed
the silkworm on a flat patch,

00:14:05.414 --> 00:14:07.152
not inside a box,

00:14:07.176 --> 00:14:10.367
we realized it would spin a flat cocoon

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:13.368
and it would still
healthily metamorphisize.

00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:17.766
So we started designing different
environments, different scaffolds,

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.525
and we discovered that
the shape, the composition,

00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:24.262
the structure of the cocoon, was directly
informed by the environment.

00:14:24.866 --> 00:14:29.219
Silkworms are often boiled to death
inside their cocoons,

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:32.425
their silk unraveled and used
in the textile industry.

00:14:32.933 --> 00:14:39.392
We realized that designing these templates
allowed us to give shape to raw silk

00:14:39.416 --> 00:14:42.486
without boiling a single cocoon.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:46.193
(Applause)

00:14:46.217 --> 00:14:48.939
They would healthily metamorphisize,

00:14:48.963 --> 00:14:51.493
and we would be able
to create these things.

00:14:51.517 --> 00:14:54.624
So we scaled this process up
to architectural scale.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.301
We had a robot spin
the template out of silk,

00:14:58.325 --> 00:15:00.005
and we placed it on our site.

00:15:00.489 --> 00:15:05.373
We knew silkworms migrated
toward darker and colder areas,

00:15:05.397 --> 00:15:08.717
so we used a sun path diagram
to reveal the distribution

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.890
of light and heat on our structure.

00:15:11.692 --> 00:15:14.202
We then created holes, or apertures,

00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:17.975
that would lock in the rays
of light and heat,

00:15:17.999 --> 00:15:21.714
distributing those silkworms
on the structure.

00:15:22.777 --> 00:15:25.150
We were ready to receive the caterpillars.

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:28.893
We ordered 6,500 silkworms
from an online silk farm.

00:15:30.031 --> 00:15:33.959
And after four weeks of feeding,
they were ready to spin with us.

00:15:33.983 --> 00:15:37.515
We placed them carefully
at the bottom rim of the scaffold,

00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:41.975
and as they spin they pupate,
they mate, they lay eggs,

00:15:41.999 --> 00:15:47.104
and life begins all over again --
just like us but much, much shorter.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:53.045
Bucky Fuller said that tension
is the great integrity,

00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:54.692
and he was right.

00:15:54.716 --> 00:15:58.438
As they spin biological silk
over robotically spun silk,

00:15:58.462 --> 00:16:01.126
they give this entire
pavilion its integrity.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.000
And over two to three weeks,

00:16:03.024 --> 00:16:07.679
6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers.

00:16:07.703 --> 00:16:11.376
In a curious symmetry, this is also
the length of the Silk Road.

00:16:12.837 --> 00:16:16.692
The moths, after they hatch,
produce 1.5 million eggs.

00:16:16.716 --> 00:16:20.830
This could be used for 250
additional pavilions for the future.

00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:24.704
So here they are, the two worldviews.

00:16:24.728 --> 00:16:28.495
One spins silk out of a robotic arm,

00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:30.851
the other fills in the gaps.

00:16:32.182 --> 00:16:35.963
If the final frontier of design
is to breathe life into the products

00:16:35.987 --> 00:16:37.781
and the buildings around us,

00:16:37.805 --> 00:16:39.975
to form a two-material ecology,

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.603
then designers must unite
these two worldviews.

00:16:43.627 --> 00:16:47.404
Which brings us back, of course,
to the beginning.

00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:51.724
Here's to a new age of design,
a new age of creation,

00:16:51.748 --> 00:16:55.096
that takes us from
a nature-inspired design

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.975
to a design-inspired nature,

00:16:57.999 --> 00:17:01.975
and that demands of us for the first time

00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:06.142
that we mother nature.

00:17:06.793 --> 00:17:07.827
Thank you.

00:17:07.851 --> 00:17:14.847
(Applause)

00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:16.975
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:19.999
(Applause)
