00:00:06.437 --> 00:00:08.444
(Guitar music)

00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:17.982
I was just thinking

00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:24.530
that I have been missing you way too long

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:30.694
There's something inside this weary head

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:35.744
that wants us to love just instead

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:38.913
But I was just thinking,

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:45.599
merely thinking

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:51.923
I've got loads of pictures,

00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:59.055
I've got the one of you
in that dancing dress

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.197
But man I feel silly in that dim light

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:09.654
Just after doing you
by the sight of my Kodak delights,

00:01:09.678 --> 00:01:14.050
I am sinking,

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.131
merely sinking

00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:27.868
I think about long distance rates
instead of kissing you babe

00:01:27.892 --> 00:01:32.810
I'm a singer without a song

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:35.345
If I wait for you longer

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.799
my affection is stronger

00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:44.816
and I ... I was just thinking,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.256
merely thinking

00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:55.976
that this boat is sinking

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:10.674
I'm tired of postcards,

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:17.802
especially the ones
with cute dogs and cupids

00:02:18.527 --> 00:02:22.910
I'm tired of calling you and missing you

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.815
and dreaming I slept with you

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:30.099
Don't get me wrong
I still desperately love you

00:02:30.123 --> 00:02:33.876
inside this weary head

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.560
I just want us to love just instead

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:44.413
But I was just thinking and thinking,

00:02:44.437 --> 00:02:48.062
merely thinking

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:58.290
I think about long distance rates
instead of kissing you babe

00:02:58.314 --> 00:03:03.040
and time is running me still

00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:05.644
If I wait for you longer

00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:09.602
my affection is stronger

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:14.922
I ... I was just thinking

00:03:18.873 --> 00:03:24.950
I ... I was just thinking

00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:31.631
that I'm tired of calling you once a week

00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:37.981
thinking of long distance rates
instead of kissing you

00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:43.904
So baby I'm sinking,

00:03:43.928 --> 00:03:46.102
merely sinking

00:03:47.788 --> 00:03:49.788
(Guitar music ends)

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.513
(Applause)

00:03:57.865 --> 00:03:59.022
Thank you.

00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:02.579
Singing is sharing.

00:04:04.314 --> 00:04:08.608
When you sing, you have to know
what you're talking about intimately,

00:04:08.632 --> 00:04:11.918
and you have to be willing
to share this insight

00:04:11.942 --> 00:04:14.031
and give away a piece of yourself.

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:18.568
I look for this intention
to share in everything,

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:24.199
and I ask: what are the intentions
behind this architecture or this product

00:04:24.223 --> 00:04:26.274
or this restaurant or this meal?

00:04:26.896 --> 00:04:29.980
And if your intentions
are to impress people

00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:32.610
or to get the big applause at the end,

00:04:32.634 --> 00:04:34.872
then you are taking, not giving.

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:38.662
And this is a song that's about --

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:41.384
it's the kind of song that everyone
has their version of.

00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:43.572
This song is called "Home,"

00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:47.342
and it's sort of a "This is where
I'm from, nice to meet you all,"

00:04:47.366 --> 00:04:48.518
kind of song.

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:50.739
(Laughter)

00:04:50.763 --> 00:04:54.539
(Applause)

00:04:57.186 --> 00:04:59.186
(Piano music)

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:49.262
Home is the sound of birds
early in the morning

00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:54.545
Home is a song I've always remembered

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:59.564
Home is the memory
of my first day in school

00:05:59.588 --> 00:06:04.227
Home is the books that I carry around

00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:08.732
Home is an alley in a faraway town

00:06:08.756 --> 00:06:14.584
Home is the places I’ve been
and where I’d like to go

00:06:18.742 --> 00:06:20.957
Home

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:25.251
I'm always gonna feel at home

00:06:25.275 --> 00:06:29.885
No matter where I may roam

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:34.226
I'm always gonna find my way back home

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.051
No matter how far I’m gone

00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:45.003
I’m always gonna feel this longing

00:06:45.027 --> 00:06:50.898
No matter where I might stay

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.695
Home is a feather twirling in the air

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:05.828
Home is flowers in a windowsill

00:07:05.852 --> 00:07:09.298
Home is all the things she said to me

00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:14.227
Home is a photo I never threw away

00:07:15.481 --> 00:07:19.640
Home is the smile on my face when I die

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:25.949
Home is the taste of an apple pie

00:07:32.175 --> 00:07:38.660
I met a woman, she always lived
in the same place

00:07:39.929 --> 00:07:45.373
And she said home is where
you’re born and raised

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.518
And I met a man, he sat
looking out to the sea

00:07:55.716 --> 00:08:01.600
And he said home is where you want to be

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.985
I met a girl in some downtown bar

00:08:11.877 --> 00:08:17.199
And she said I'll have
whatever he's having

00:08:20.231 --> 00:08:25.170
And I asked her how come
we never met before?

00:08:26.487 --> 00:08:33.346
And she said all my life I’ve been trying

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.107
to get a place of my own

00:08:37.582 --> 00:08:41.049
I’m always gonna feel at home

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.265
No matter where I may roam

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:50.777
Always gonna find my way back home

00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:54.331
No matter how far I’m gone

00:08:54.816 --> 00:09:00.478
I'm always gonna feel this longing

00:09:01.517 --> 00:09:07.185
No matter where I might stay

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:12.033
(Piano music)

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.840
(Piano music ends)

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:32.146
(Applause)
