00:00:00.452 --> 00:00:05.579
Do you think the world is going
to be a better place next year?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.823
In the next decade?

00:00:08.657 --> 00:00:11.420
Can we end hunger,

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.975
achieve gender equality,

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.121
halt climate change,

00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:18.708
all in the next 15 years?

00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:23.668
Well, according to the governments
of the world, yes we can.

00:00:24.343 --> 00:00:26.961
In the last few days,
the leaders of the world,

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.461
meeting at the UN in New York,

00:00:29.485 --> 00:00:32.240
agreed a new set of Global Goals

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:35.064
for the development of the world to 2030.

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:36.916
And here they are:

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.172
these goals are the product
of a massive consultation exercise.

00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:47.085
The Global Goals are who we,
humanity, want to be.

00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:51.575
Now that's the plan, but can we get there?

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:55.620
Can this vision for a better world
really be achieved?

00:00:56.247 --> 00:01:00.007
Well, I'm here today because
we've run the numbers,

00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:04.575
and the answer, shockingly,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.043
is that maybe we actually can.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:10.702
But not with business as usual.

00:01:11.757 --> 00:01:14.812
Now, the idea that the world
is going to get a better place

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:16.741
may seem a little fanciful.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.575
Watch the news every day and the world
seems to be going backwards, not forwards.

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:23.297
And let's be frank:

00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:26.575
it's pretty easy to be skeptical
about grand announcements

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:28.018
coming out of the UN.

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:33.162
But please, I invite you to suspend
your disbelief for just a moment.

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:35.853
Because back in 2001,

00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:40.397
the UN agreed another set of goals,
the Millennium Development Goals.

00:01:41.138 --> 00:01:45.338
And the flagship target there
was to halve the proportion of people

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:48.313
living in poverty by 2015.

00:01:49.072 --> 00:01:52.889
The target was to take
from a baseline of 1990,

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:56.575
when 36 percent of the world's
population lived in poverty,

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.792
to get to 18 percent poverty this year.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.575
Did we hit this target?

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.050
Well, no, we didn't.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.280
We exceeded it.

00:02:06.677 --> 00:02:10.860
This year, global poverty
is going to fall to 12 percent.

00:02:11.804 --> 00:02:13.575
Now, that's still not good enough,

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.218
and the world does still have
plenty of problems.

00:02:17.242 --> 00:02:22.677
But the pessimists and doomsayers
who say that the world can't get better

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:24.010
are simply wrong.

00:02:25.748 --> 00:02:27.575
So how did we achieve this success?

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.740
Well, a lot of it was because
of economic growth.

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:36.575
Some of the biggest reductions in poverty
were in countries such as China and India,

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.461
which have seen rapid
economic growth in recent years.

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:43.575
So can we pull off the same trick again?

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:47.467
Can economic growth
get us to the Global Goals?

00:02:48.642 --> 00:02:50.381
Well, to answer that question,

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:54.575
we need to benchmark where the world
is today against the Global Goals

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.173
and figure out how far we have to travel.

00:02:58.046 --> 00:02:59.949
But that ain't easy,

00:02:59.973 --> 00:03:02.790
because the Global Goals
aren't just ambitious,

00:03:02.814 --> 00:03:05.069
they're also pretty complicated.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.743
Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:12.452
and literally hundreds of indicators.

00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:17.048
Also, while some of the goals
are pretty specific --

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.495
end hunger --

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.415
others are a lot vaguer --

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.041
promote peaceful and tolerant societies.

00:03:23.924 --> 00:03:25.849
So to help us with this benchmarking,

00:03:25.873 --> 00:03:29.619
I'm going to use a tool
called the Social Progress Index.

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:34.120
What this does is measures all the stuff
the Global Goals are trying to achieve,

00:03:34.144 --> 00:03:38.306
but sums it up into a single number
that we can use as our benchmark

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.479
and track progress over time.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.453
The Social Progress Index basically asks
three fundamental questions

00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:45.738
about a society.

00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:49.679
First of all, does everyone have
the basic needs of survival:

00:03:49.703 --> 00:03:52.511
food, water, shelter, safety?

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:56.289
Secondly, does everyone have
the building blocks of a better life:

00:03:56.313 --> 00:04:00.574
education, information, health
and a sustainable environment?

00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:04.839
And does everyone have
the opportunity to improve their lives,

00:04:04.863 --> 00:04:08.863
through rights, freedom of choice,
freedom from discrimination,

00:04:08.887 --> 00:04:11.590
and access to the world's
most advanced knowledge?

00:04:12.463 --> 00:04:16.575
The Social Progress Index sums all this
together using 52 indicators

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.531
to create an aggregate score
on a scale of 0 to 100.

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:24.599
And what we find is that there's
a wide diversity of performance

00:04:24.623 --> 00:04:25.784
in the world today.

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.718
The highest performing country,
Norway, scores 88.

00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:34.668
The lowest performing country,
Central African Republic, scores 31.

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.695
And we can add up
all the countries together,

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.153
weighting for the different
population sizes,

00:04:40.177 --> 00:04:43.575
and that global score is 61.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.311
In concrete terms,

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:49.093
that means that the average human being
is living on a level of social progress

00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:52.539
about the same of Cuba
or Kazakhstan today.

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.785
That's where we are today: 61 out of 100.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.428
What do we have to get to
to achieve the Global Goals?

00:05:00.254 --> 00:05:02.742
Now, the Global Goals
are certainly ambitious,

00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:06.800
but they're not about turning the world
into Norway in just 15 years.

00:05:07.395 --> 00:05:11.494
So having looked at the numbers,
my estimate is that a score of 75

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:15.575
would not only be a giant leap forward
in human well-being,

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.721
it would also count as hitting
the Global Goals target.

00:05:19.412 --> 00:05:22.198
So there's our target, 75 out of 100.

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:24.251
Can we get there?

00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:27.259
Well, the Social Progress Index
can help us calculate this,

00:05:27.283 --> 00:05:28.949
because as you might have noticed,

00:05:28.973 --> 00:05:31.198
there are no economic indicators in there;

00:05:31.222 --> 00:05:35.699
there's no GDP or economic growth
in the Social Progress Index model.

00:05:36.032 --> 00:05:39.575
And what that lets us do
is understand the relationship

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.883
between economic growth
and social progress.

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:45.369
Let me show you on this chart.

00:05:45.393 --> 00:05:48.575
So here on the vertical axis,
I've put social progress,

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.167
the stuff the Global Goals
are trying to achieve.

00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:52.737
Higher is better.

00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:56.145
And then on the horizontal axis,
is GDP per capita.

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.708
Further to the right means richer.

00:05:58.732 --> 00:06:02.032
And in there, I'm now going to put
all the countries of the world,

00:06:02.056 --> 00:06:04.164
each one represented by a dot,

00:06:04.188 --> 00:06:06.783
and on top of that I'm going to put
the regression line

00:06:06.807 --> 00:06:08.806
that shows the average relationship.

00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:12.691
And what this tells us
is that as we get richer,

00:06:12.715 --> 00:06:15.223
social progress does tend to improve.

00:06:16.072 --> 00:06:20.663
However, as we get richer,
each extra dollar of GDP

00:06:20.687 --> 00:06:24.284
is buying us less and less
social progress.

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:28.848
And now we can use this information
to start building our forecast.

00:06:29.403 --> 00:06:32.209
So here is the world in 2015.

00:06:32.718 --> 00:06:36.116
We have a social progress score of 61

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.324
and a GDP per capita of $14,000.

00:06:39.895 --> 00:06:44.123
And the place we're trying to get to,
remember, is 75, that Global Goals target.

00:06:44.147 --> 00:06:47.805
So here we are today,
$14,000 per capita GDP.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.655
How rich are we going to be in 2030?

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:52.517
That's what we need to know next.

00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:56.792
Well, the best forecast we can find comes
from the US Department of Agriculture,

00:06:56.816 --> 00:07:01.467
which forecasts 3.1 percent
average global economic growth

00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:03.235
over the next 15 years,

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:06.378
which means that in 2030,
if they're right,

00:07:06.402 --> 00:07:10.428
per capita GDP will be about $23,000.

00:07:11.293 --> 00:07:13.834
So now the question is:
if we get that much richer,

00:07:13.858 --> 00:07:16.159
how much social progress
are we going to get?

00:07:16.747 --> 00:07:19.357
Well, we asked a team
of economists at Deloitte

00:07:19.381 --> 00:07:21.150
who checked and crunched the numbers,

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:26.126
and they came back and said, well, look:
if the world's average wealth goes

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.926
from $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year,

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.238
social progress is going to increase

00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:36.625
from 61 to 62.4.

00:07:36.926 --> 00:07:38.839
(Laughter)

00:07:38.863 --> 00:07:43.362
Just 62.4. Just a tiny increase.

00:07:44.315 --> 00:07:45.862
Now this seems a bit strange.

00:07:45.886 --> 00:07:48.098
Economic growth seems
to have really helped

00:07:48.122 --> 00:07:49.811
in the fight against poverty,

00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:52.035
but it doesn't seem
to be having much impact

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:54.142
on trying to get to the Global Goals.

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:55.761
So what's going on?

00:07:56.182 --> 00:07:57.873
Well, I think there are two things.

00:07:57.897 --> 00:08:01.764
The first is that in a way,
we're the victims of our own success.

00:08:01.788 --> 00:08:04.780
We've used up the easy wins
from economic growth,

00:08:04.804 --> 00:08:07.152
and now we're moving on
to harder problems.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.038
And also, we know that economic growth
comes with costs as well as benefits.

00:08:12.062 --> 00:08:16.586
There are costs to the environment, costs
from new health problems like obesity.

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:19.110
So that's the bad news.

00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:23.441
We're not going to get to the Global Goals
just by getting richer.

00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:26.033
So are the pessimists right?

00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:27.941
Well, maybe not.

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:31.868
Because the Social Progress Index
also has some very good news.

00:08:32.683 --> 00:08:35.042
Let me take you back
to that regression line.

00:08:35.066 --> 00:08:38.446
So this is the average relationship
between GDP and social progress,

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.356
and this is what our
last forecast was based on.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.713
But as you saw already,

00:08:43.737 --> 00:08:47.662
there is actually lots of noise
around this trend line.

00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:50.908
What that tells us, quite simply,

00:08:50.932 --> 00:08:54.035
is that GDP is not destiny.

00:08:54.589 --> 00:08:57.067
We have countries that are underperforming

00:08:57.091 --> 00:08:59.740
on social progress,
relative to their wealth.

00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:02.671
Russia has lots
of natural resource wealth,

00:09:02.695 --> 00:09:04.847
but lots of social problems.

00:09:04.871 --> 00:09:07.102
China has boomed economically,

00:09:07.126 --> 00:09:11.329
but hasn't made much headway
on human rights or environmental issues.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:16.574
India has a space program
and millions of people without toilets.

00:09:17.264 --> 00:09:20.561
Now, on the other hand, we have countries
that are overperforming

00:09:20.585 --> 00:09:23.575
on social progress relative to their GDP.

00:09:23.922 --> 00:09:29.633
Costa Rica has prioritized education,
health and environmental sustainability,

00:09:29.657 --> 00:09:33.578
and as a result, it's achieving
a very high level of social progress,

00:09:33.602 --> 00:09:36.852
despite only having a rather modest GDP.

00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:39.575
And Costa Rica's not alone.

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:43.575
From poor countries like Rwanda
to richer countries like New Zealand,

00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:47.197
we see that it's possible to get
lots of social progress,

00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:49.824
even if your GDP is not so great.

00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:53.903
And that's really important,
because it tells us two things.

00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:59.492
First of all, it tells us that we already
in the world have the solutions

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:03.344
to many of the problems
that the Global Goals are trying to solve.

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:07.601
It also tells us
that we're not slaves to GDP.

00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:12.304
Our choices matter: if we prioritize
the well-being of people,

00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:16.204
then we can make a lot more progress
than our GDP might expect.

00:10:17.008 --> 00:10:20.160
How much? Enough to get us
to the Global Goals?

00:10:20.184 --> 00:10:21.795
Well, let's look at some numbers.

00:10:21.819 --> 00:10:25.680
What we know already: the world today
is scoring 61 on social progress,

00:10:25.704 --> 00:10:28.502
and the place we want to get to is 75.

00:10:28.526 --> 00:10:30.746
If we rely on economic growth alone,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.351
we're going to get to 62.4.

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:37.477
So let's assume now that we can get
the countries that are currently

00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:40.695
underperforming on social progress --
the Russia, China, Indias --

00:10:40.719 --> 00:10:42.019
just up to the average.

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:44.599
How much social progress does that get us?

00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:46.734
Well, that takes us to 65.

00:10:47.297 --> 00:10:50.203
It's a bit better, but still
quite a long way to go.

00:10:50.227 --> 00:10:52.588
So let's get a little bit more
optimistic and say,

00:10:52.612 --> 00:10:55.402
what if every country
gets a little bit better

00:10:55.426 --> 00:10:57.813
at turning its wealth into well-being?

00:10:58.194 --> 00:11:00.591
Well then, we get to 67.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.095
And now let's be even bolder still.

00:11:04.119 --> 00:11:08.575
What if every country in the world
chose to be like Costa Rica

00:11:08.599 --> 00:11:10.969
in prioritizing human well-being,

00:11:10.993 --> 00:11:13.575
using its wealth for the well-being
of its citizens?

00:11:13.599 --> 00:11:17.818
Well then, we get to nearly 73,
very close to the Global Goals.

00:11:18.599 --> 00:11:20.575
Can we achieve the Global Goals?

00:11:20.599 --> 00:11:22.801
Certainly not with business as usual.

00:11:23.278 --> 00:11:27.629
Even a flood tide of economic growth
is not going to get us there,

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:30.716
if it just raises the mega-yachts
and the super-wealthy

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.534
and leaves the rest behind.

00:11:33.177 --> 00:11:37.171
If we're going to achieve the Global Goals
we have to do things differently.

00:11:37.195 --> 00:11:41.404
We have to prioritize social progress,
and really scale solutions

00:11:41.428 --> 00:11:42.918
around the world.

00:11:42.942 --> 00:11:46.657
I believe the Global Goals
are a historic opportunity,

00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:50.276
because the world's leaders
have promised to deliver them.

00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:55.074
Let's not dismiss the goals
or slide into pessimism;

00:11:55.098 --> 00:11:57.090
let's hold them to that promise.

00:11:57.829 --> 00:12:01.159
And we need to hold them to that promise
by holding them accountable,

00:12:01.183 --> 00:12:04.474
tracking their progress all the way
through the next 15 years.

00:12:04.928 --> 00:12:06.610
And I want to finish by showing you

00:12:06.634 --> 00:12:09.399
a way to do that, called
the People's Report Card.

00:12:09.423 --> 00:12:14.330
The People's Report Card brings together
all this data into a simple framework

00:12:14.354 --> 00:12:16.894
that we'll all be familiar
with from our school days,

00:12:16.918 --> 00:12:18.346
to hold them to account.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.625
It grades our performance
on the Global Goals

00:12:20.649 --> 00:12:24.120
on a scale from F to A,

00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:29.237
where F is humanity at its worst,
and A is humanity at its best.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:34.461
Our world today is scoring a C-.

00:12:35.405 --> 00:12:38.834
The Global Goals are all about
getting to an A,

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:42.575
and that's why we're going to be updating
the People's Report Card annually,

00:12:42.599 --> 00:12:45.812
for the world and for all
the countries of the world,

00:12:45.836 --> 00:12:48.427
so we can hold our leaders to account

00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:52.593
to achieve this target
and fulfill this promise.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.827
Because getting to the Global Goals will
only happen if we do things differently,

00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:00.018
if our leaders do things differently,

00:13:00.042 --> 00:13:03.939
and for that to happen,
that needs us to demand it.

00:13:04.494 --> 00:13:07.971
So let's reject business as usual.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.913
Let's demand a different path.

00:13:11.365 --> 00:13:15.183
Let's choose the world that we want.

00:13:16.157 --> 00:13:17.309
Thank you.

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:22.575
(Applause)

00:13:22.599 --> 00:13:24.476
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael.

00:13:26.675 --> 00:13:29.498
Michael, just one question:
the Millennium Development Goals

00:13:29.522 --> 00:13:31.003
established 15 years ago,

00:13:31.027 --> 00:13:34.104
they were kind of applying
to every country

00:13:34.128 --> 00:13:37.695
but it turned out to be really
a scorecard for emerging countries.

00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:40.171
Now the new Global Goals
are explicitly universal.

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:44.347
They ask for every country to show action
and to show progress.

00:13:44.371 --> 00:13:47.359
How can I, as a private citizen,
use the report card

00:13:47.383 --> 00:13:50.217
to create pressure for action?

00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:54.116
Michael Green: This is a really important
point; it's a big shift in priorities --

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.619
it's no longer about poor
countries and just poverty.

00:13:56.643 --> 00:13:57.858
It's about every country.

00:13:57.882 --> 00:14:01.512
And every country is going to have
challenges in getting to the Global Goals.

00:14:01.536 --> 00:14:04.846
Even, I'm sorry to say, Bruno,
Switzerland has got to work to do.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.240
And so that's why we're going to produce
these report cards in 2016

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:09.750
for every country in the world.

00:14:09.774 --> 00:14:11.853
Then we can really see, how are we doing?

00:14:11.877 --> 00:14:14.758
And it's not going to be rich countries
scoring straight A's.

00:14:14.782 --> 00:14:17.390
And that, then, I think,
is to provide a point of focus

00:14:17.414 --> 00:14:20.870
for people to start demanding action
and start demanding progress.

00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:22.342
BG: Thank you very much.

00:14:22.366 --> 00:14:25.599
(Applause)
