WEBVTT

00:00:00.816 --> 00:00:03.388
We all go to doctors.

00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:09.282
And we do so with trust and blind faith

00:00:09.306 --> 00:00:13.164
that the test they are ordering
and the medications they're prescribing

00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:16.363
are based upon evidence --

00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:19.314
evidence that's designed to help us.

00:00:20.338 --> 00:00:26.181
However, the reality is that that hasn't
always been the case for everyone.

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:28.381
What if I told you

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:32.351
that the medical science discovered
over the past century

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:36.042
has been based on only
half the population?

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.360
I'm an emergency medicine doctor.

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:42.400
I was trained to be prepared
in a medical emergency.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.389
It's about saving lives. How cool is that?

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:51.652
OK, there's a lot of runny noses
and stubbed toes,

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:55.341
but no matter who walks
through the door to the ER,

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:57.817
we order the same tests,

00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.975
we prescribe the same medication,

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.401
without ever thinking about the sex
or gender of our patients.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.624
Why would we?

00:01:07.053 --> 00:01:10.794
We were never taught that there were
any differences between men and women.

00:01:10.818 --> 00:01:15.377
A recent Government Accountability study
revealed that 80 percent of the drugs

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.552
withdrawn from the market

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.969
are due to side effects on women.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.391
So let's think about that for a minute.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:27.289
Why are we discovering
side effects on women

00:01:27.313 --> 00:01:30.599
only after a drug has been
released to the market?

00:01:31.496 --> 00:01:37.156
Do you know that it takes years
for a drug to go from an idea

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.337
to being tested on cells in a laboratory,

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:42.329
to animal studies,

00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:44.480
to then clinical trials on humans,

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:48.375
finally to go through
a regulatory approval process,

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.735
to be available for your doctor
to prescribe to you?

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.540
Not to mention the millions and billions
of dollars of funding

00:01:57.564 --> 00:01:59.946
it takes to go through that process.

00:02:01.597 --> 00:02:04.549
So why are we discovering
unacceptable side effects

00:02:04.573 --> 00:02:09.024
on half the population
after that has gone through?

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:12.427
What's happening?

00:02:12.777 --> 00:02:16.881
Well, it turns out that those cells
used in that laboratory,

00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:18.835
they're male cells,

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:22.261
and the animals used
in the animal studies were male animals,

00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:27.375
and the clinical trials have been
performed almost exclusively on men.

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:34.530
How is it that the male model became
our framework for medical research?

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:38.625
Let's look at an example that has been
popularized in the media,

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:41.855
and it has to do
with the sleep aid Ambien.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.643
Ambien was released on the market
over 20 years ago,

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:51.480
and since then, hundreds of millions
of prescriptions have been written,

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:55.952
primarily to women, because women
suffer more sleep disorders than men.

00:02:57.047 --> 00:02:59.223
But just this past year,

00:02:59.247 --> 00:03:02.671
the Food and Drug Administration
recommended cutting the dose in half

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:05.582
for women only,

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:08.443
because they just realized
that women metabolize the drug

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.380
at a slower rate than men,

00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:13.443
causing them to wake up in the morning

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.661
with more of the active drug
in their system.

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:20.615
And then they're drowsy and they're
getting behind the wheel of the car,

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.606
and they're at risk
for motor vehicle accidents.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:28.899
And I can't help but think,
as an emergency physician,

00:03:28.923 --> 00:03:33.716
how many of my patients
that I've cared for over the years

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.546
were involved in a motor vehicle accident

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.022
that possibly could have been prevented

00:03:40.046 --> 00:03:45.161
if this type of analysis was performed
and acted upon 20 years ago

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:47.193
when this drug was first released.

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:52.284
How many other things need
to be analyzed by gender?

00:03:53.197 --> 00:03:54.879
What else are we missing?

00:03:57.555 --> 00:04:01.231
World War II changed a lot of things,

00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:04.136
and one of them was this need
to protect people

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.500
from becoming victims of medical research
without informed consent.

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:13.143
So some much-needed guidelines
or rules were set into place,

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:18.189
and part of that was this desire
to protect women of childbearing age

00:04:18.213 --> 00:04:21.164
from entering into any
medical research studies.

00:04:22.016 --> 00:04:26.579
There was fear: what if something
happened to the fetus during the study?

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:28.915
Who would be responsible?

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.488
And so the scientists
at this time actually thought

00:04:32.512 --> 00:04:35.128
this was a blessing in disguise,

00:04:35.152 --> 00:04:40.365
because let's face it -- men's bodies
are pretty homogeneous.

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:44.313
They don't have the constantly
fluctuating levels of hormones

00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:48.081
that could disrupt clean data
they could get if they had only men.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.920
It was easier. It was cheaper.

00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:56.484
Not to mention, at this time,
there was a general assumption

00:04:56.508 --> 00:05:00.733
that men and women
were alike in every way,

00:05:00.757 --> 00:05:04.200
apart from their reproductive organs
and sex hormones.

00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:08.028
So it was decided:

00:05:09.117 --> 00:05:12.633
medical research was performed on men,

00:05:12.657 --> 00:05:15.414
and the results were later
applied to women.

00:05:17.203 --> 00:05:20.744
What did this do to the notion
of women's health?

00:05:20.768 --> 00:05:25.024
Women's health became synonymous
with reproduction:

00:05:25.048 --> 00:05:29.593
breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.

00:05:30.355 --> 00:05:33.387
It's this term we now refer
to as "bikini medicine."

00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:37.105
And this stayed this way
until about the 1980s,

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.614
when this concept was challenged
by the medical community

00:05:40.638 --> 00:05:44.779
and by the public health policymakers
when they realized that

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:49.106
by excluding women
from all medical research studies

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.619
we actually did them a disservice,

00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:54.975
in that apart from reproductive issues,

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.563
virtually nothing was known
about the unique needs

00:05:57.587 --> 00:05:59.305
of the female patient.

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:06.513
Since that time, an overwhelming amount
of evidence has come to light

00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:12.048
that shows us just how different
men and women are in every way.

00:06:17.297 --> 00:06:20.050
You know, we have this saying in medicine:

00:06:20.074 --> 00:06:23.022
children are not just little adults.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.747
And we say that to remind ourselves

00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:31.448
that children actually have
a different physiology than normal adults.

00:06:32.678 --> 00:06:37.635
And it's because of this that the medical
specialty of pediatrics came to light.

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:43.905
And we now conduct research on children
in order to improve their lives.

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:47.936
And I know the same thing
can be said about women.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.021
Women are not just men
with boobs and tubes.

00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:58.117
But they have their own
anatomy and physiology

00:06:58.141 --> 00:07:01.671
that deserves to be studied
with the same intensity.

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:06.312
Let's take the cardiovascular
system, for example.

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:10.706
This area in medicine has done the most
to try to figure out

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.879
why it seems men and women have
completely different heart attacks.

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:21.089
Heart disease is the number one killer
for both men and women,

00:07:21.113 --> 00:07:25.549
but more women die within the first year
of having a heart attack than men.

00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:31.063
Men will complain
of crushing chest pain --

00:07:31.087 --> 00:07:33.569
an elephant is sitting on their chest.

00:07:34.455 --> 00:07:35.995
And we call this typical.

00:07:37.622 --> 00:07:40.712
Women have chest pain, too.

00:07:40.736 --> 00:07:47.433
But more women than men
will complain of "just not feeling right,"

00:07:48.898 --> 00:07:51.767
"can't seem to get enough air in,"

00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:53.765
"just so tired lately."

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.903
And for some reason we call this atypical,

00:07:57.927 --> 00:08:01.854
even though, as I mentioned,
women do make up half the population.

00:08:03.537 --> 00:08:09.308
And so what is some of the evidence
to help explain some of these differences?

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:12.530
If we look at the anatomy,

00:08:12.554 --> 00:08:18.569
the blood vessels that surround the heart
are smaller in women compared to men,

00:08:18.593 --> 00:08:23.073
and the way that those blood vessels
develop disease is different

00:08:23.097 --> 00:08:25.152
in women compared to men.

00:08:25.875 --> 00:08:31.027
And the test that we use to determine
if someone is at risk for a heart attack,

00:08:31.051 --> 00:08:35.623
well, they were initially designed
and tested and perfected in men,

00:08:35.647 --> 00:08:38.781
and so aren't as good
at determining that in women.

00:08:40.305 --> 00:08:43.242
And then if we think
about the medications --

00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:46.513
common medications
that we use, like aspirin.

00:08:47.767 --> 00:08:52.294
We give aspirin to healthy men to help
prevent them from having a heart attack,

00:08:52.318 --> 00:08:56.552
but do you know that if you
give aspirin to a healthy woman,

00:08:56.576 --> 00:08:58.162
it's actually harmful?

00:09:00.376 --> 00:09:02.758
What this is doing is merely telling us

00:09:02.782 --> 00:09:05.534
that we are scratching the surface.

00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:10.571
Emergency medicine
is a fast-paced business.

00:09:11.563 --> 00:09:14.916
In how many life-saving areas of medicine,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.916
like cancer and stroke,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.073
are there important differences between
men and women that we could be utilizing?

00:09:24.252 --> 00:09:29.056
Or even, why is it that some people
get those runny noses

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.265
more than others,

00:09:31.289 --> 00:09:34.616
or why the pain medication that we give
to those stubbed toes

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.845
work in some and not in others?

00:09:41.288 --> 00:09:46.518
The Institute of Medicine has said
every cell has a sex.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.233
What does this mean?

00:09:50.532 --> 00:09:52.930
Sex is DNA.

00:09:52.954 --> 00:09:57.295
Gender is how someone
presents themselves in society.

00:09:57.883 --> 00:10:00.423
And these two may not always match up,

00:10:00.447 --> 00:10:03.613
as we can see with our
transgendered population.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.655
But it's important to realize
that from the moment of conception,

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:11.801
every cell in our bodies --

00:10:11.825 --> 00:10:15.126
skin, hair, heart and lungs --

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.437
contains our own unique DNA,

00:10:18.461 --> 00:10:22.212
and that DNA contains
the chromosomes that determine

00:10:22.236 --> 00:10:27.297
whether we become
male or female, man or woman.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.988
It used to be thought

00:10:30.012 --> 00:10:34.340
that those sex-determining
chromosomes pictured here --

00:10:34.364 --> 00:10:37.737
XY if you're male, XX if you're female --

00:10:37.761 --> 00:10:42.975
merely determined whether you
would be born with ovaries or testes,

00:10:42.999 --> 00:10:46.740
and it was the sex hormones
that those organs produced

00:10:46.764 --> 00:10:51.329
that were responsible for the differences
we see in the opposite sex.

00:10:52.757 --> 00:10:57.591
But we now know that
that theory was wrong --

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.060
or it's at least a little incomplete.

00:11:00.084 --> 00:11:04.862
And thankfully, scientists like Dr. Page
from the Whitehead Institute,

00:11:04.886 --> 00:11:06.860
who works on the Y chromosome,

00:11:06.884 --> 00:11:09.051
and Doctor Yang from UCLA,

00:11:09.075 --> 00:11:14.734
they have found evidence that tells us
that those sex-determining chromosomes

00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:17.355
that are in every cell in our bodies

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:22.738
continue to remain active
for our entire lives

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:28.092
and could be what's responsible
for the differences we see

00:11:28.116 --> 00:11:30.331
in the dosing of drugs,

00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:33.321
or why there are differences
between men and women

00:11:33.345 --> 00:11:36.861
in the susceptibility
and severity of diseases.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.952
This new knowledge is the game-changer,

00:11:45.425 --> 00:11:48.799
and it's up to those scientists
that continue to find that evidence,

00:11:48.823 --> 00:11:52.976
but it's up to the clinicians
to start translating this data

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.999
at the bedside, today.

00:11:57.168 --> 00:11:58.324
Right now.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.474
And to help do this, I'm a co-founder
of a national organization

00:12:04.498 --> 00:12:07.481
called Sex and Gender
Women's Health Collaborative,

00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:12.125
and we collect all of this data
so that it's available for teaching

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:13.554
and for patient care.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.748
And we're working to bring together
the medical educators to the table.

00:12:19.756 --> 00:12:21.224
That's a big job.

00:12:22.162 --> 00:12:27.301
It's changing the way medical training
has been done since its inception.

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:30.882
But I believe in them.

00:12:31.882 --> 00:12:37.479
I know they're going to see the value
of incorporating the gender lens

00:12:37.503 --> 00:12:39.225
into the current curriculum.

00:12:40.598 --> 00:12:45.216
It's about training the future
health care providers correctly.

00:12:48.437 --> 00:12:49.588
And regionally,

00:12:49.612 --> 00:12:53.473
I'm a co-creator of a division within
the Department of Emergency Medicine

00:12:53.497 --> 00:12:55.217
here at Brown University,

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:57.851
called Sex and Gender
in Emergency Medicine,

00:12:57.875 --> 00:13:02.501
and we conduct the research to determine
the differences between men and women

00:13:02.525 --> 00:13:04.683
in emergent conditions,

00:13:04.707 --> 00:13:09.975
like heart disease and stroke
and sepsis and substance abuse,

00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:14.376
but we also believe
that education is paramount.

00:13:15.304 --> 00:13:19.305
We've created a 360-degree
model of education.

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:25.287
We have programs for the doctors,
for the nurses, for the students

00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:27.017
and for the patients.

00:13:27.511 --> 00:13:31.569
Because this cannot just be left up
to the health care leaders.

00:13:32.315 --> 00:13:35.792
We all have a role in making a difference.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.507
But I must warn you: this is not easy.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.432
In fact, it's hard.

00:13:45.146 --> 00:13:49.538
It's essentially changing the way
we think about medicine

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:52.559
and health and research.

00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:56.847
It's changing our relationship
to the health care system.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.648
But there's no going back.

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:05.038
We now know just enough

00:14:05.062 --> 00:14:07.418
to know that we weren't doing it right.

00:14:09.672 --> 00:14:11.990
Martin Luther King, Jr. has said,

00:14:12.014 --> 00:14:16.663
"Change does not roll in
on the wheels of inevitability,

00:14:16.687 --> 00:14:18.861
but comes through continuous struggle."

00:14:20.314 --> 00:14:23.044
And the first step
towards change is awareness.

00:14:24.116 --> 00:14:28.194
This is not just about improving
medical care for women.

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:33.661
This is about personalized,
individualized health care for everyone.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:41.192
This awareness has the power to transform
medical care for men and women.

00:14:42.827 --> 00:14:48.515
And from now on, I want you
to ask your doctors

00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:52.816
whether the treatments you are receiving
are specific to your sex and gender.

00:14:54.246 --> 00:14:56.935
They may not know the answer --

00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:58.125
yet.

00:14:59.101 --> 00:15:02.963
But the conversation has begun,
and together we can all learn.

00:15:03.797 --> 00:15:08.174
Remember, for me
and my colleagues in this field,

00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:10.475
your sex and gender matter.

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:12.531
Thank you.

00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:16.999
(Applause)
