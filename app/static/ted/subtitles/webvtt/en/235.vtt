00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Good morning.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're all familiar with his fantastic work --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But we do not know his face.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Thousands of books have been written about him,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Let's find out.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But no faces?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I find that hard to believe.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
en face or three-quarters.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
must have made self-portraits from time to time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So let's try to find them.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I think that if we were to scan all of his work

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and looked for male portraits.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
There are about 120, you see them here.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Which ones of these could be self-portraits?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So we can eliminate all the profiles.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It also has to be sufficiently detailed.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And we know from his contemporaries

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
(Laughter)

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And here they are.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Yes, indeed, the old man is there,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, "The Musician."

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Before we go into these faces,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I've made more than 1,100 portraits myself

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
for newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
(Laughter)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But there are 1,100, and very few artists have drawn so many faces.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
OK, now let's look at these three portraits.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and look, they are very similar.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Now, are they made in the right order?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The young man should be made first.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And as you see here from the years that they were created,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
it is indeed the case.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
They are made in the right order.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
What was the age of Leonardo at the time? Does that fit?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Yes, it does. He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
of the same age as Leonardo at the time.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
But how do we know it's him, and not someone else?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Well, we need a reference.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And if we now compare the face of the statue,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
to those three faces.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Ladies and gentlemen, this story has not yet been published.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The icon of icons finally has a face.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Here he is: Leonardo da Vinci.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
(Applause)
