00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:03.388
As a singer-songwriter,

00:00:03.412 --> 00:00:07.127
people often ask me about my influences
or, as I like to call them,

00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:09.539
my sonic lineages.

00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:11.191
And I could easily tell you

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:14.635
that I was shaped by the jazz
and hip hop that I grew up with,

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.970
by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors,

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:20.897
or by the 1980s pop
on my childhood radio stations.

00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:25.374
But beyond genre,
there is another question:

00:00:25.398 --> 00:00:30.240
how do the sounds we hear every day
influence the music that we make?

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:32.600
I believe that everyday soundscape

00:00:32.624 --> 00:00:36.065
can be the most unexpected
inspiration for songwriting,

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.604
and to look at this idea
a little bit more closely,

00:00:38.628 --> 00:00:40.749
I'm going to talk today
about three things:

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.797
nature, language and silence --

00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:47.154
or rather, the impossibility
of true silence.

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:50.357
And through this I hope to give you
a sense of a world

00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:53.432
already alive with musical expression,

00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:57.437
with each of us serving
as active participants,

00:00:57.461 --> 00:00:59.716
whether we know it or not.

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:02.954
I'm going to start today with nature,
but before we do that,

00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:06.250
let's quickly listen to this snippet
of an opera singer warming up.

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:07.758
Here it is.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.700
(Singing)

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.060
(Singing ends)

00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:27.408
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:29.352
Gotcha!

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:32.812
That is actually not the sound
of an opera singer warming up.

00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:35.660
That is the sound of a bird

00:01:35.684 --> 00:01:37.606
slowed down to a pace

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.352
that the human ear mistakenly
recognizes as its own.

00:01:42.012 --> 00:01:46.816
It was released as part of Peter Szöke's
1987 Hungarian recording

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.222
"The Unknown Music of Birds,"

00:01:49.246 --> 00:01:53.117
where he records many birds
and slows down their pitches

00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:54.748
to reveal what's underneath.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.644
Let's listen to the full-speed recording.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.110
(Bird singing)

00:02:03.638 --> 00:02:05.550
Now, let's hear the two of them together

00:02:05.574 --> 00:02:07.146
so your brain can juxtapose them.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:13.167
(Bird singing at slow then full speed)

00:02:26.338 --> 00:02:28.338
(Singing ends)

00:02:30.063 --> 00:02:31.254
It's incredible.

00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:36.126
Perhaps the techniques of opera singing
were inspired by birdsong.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.768
As humans, we intuitively understand birds
to be our musical teachers.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.343
In Ethiopia, birds
are considered an integral part

00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:47.973
of the origin of music itself.

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:50.017
The story goes like this:

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:56.571
1,500 years ago, a young man
was born in the Empire of Aksum,

00:02:56.595 --> 00:02:59.142
a major trading center
of the ancient world.

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:01.066
His name was Yared.

00:03:02.402 --> 00:03:05.610
When Yared was seven years old
his father died,

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:09.257
and his mother sent him to go live
with an uncle, who was a priest

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.576
of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.734
one of the oldest churches in the world.

00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:18.353
Now, this tradition has an enormous amount
of scholarship and learning,

00:03:18.377 --> 00:03:21.389
and Yared had to study and study
and study and study,

00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:24.029
and one day he was studying under a tree,

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:26.580
when three birds came to him.

00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:30.389
One by one, these birds
became his teachers.

00:03:30.912 --> 00:03:34.204
They taught him music -- scales, in fact.

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.082
And Yared, eventually
recognized as Saint Yared,

00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:42.544
used these scales to compose
five volumes of chants and hymns

00:03:42.568 --> 00:03:44.740
for worship and celebration.

00:03:44.764 --> 00:03:48.153
And he used these scales
to compose and to create

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:50.927
an indigenous musical notation system.

00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:55.268
And these scales evolved
into what is known as kiñit,

00:03:55.292 --> 00:04:01.185
the unique, pentatonic, five-note,
modal system that is very much alive

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.433
and thriving and still evolving
in Ethiopia today.

00:04:06.531 --> 00:04:09.694
Now, I love this story because
it's true at multiple levels.

00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:12.741
Saint Yared was a real, historical figure,

00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:16.714
and the natural world
can be our musical teacher.

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:19.211
And we have so many examples of this:

00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:21.458
the Pygmies of the Congo
tune their instruments

00:04:21.482 --> 00:04:24.082
to the pitches of the birds
in the forest around them.

00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:27.574
Musician and natural soundscape
expert Bernie Krause describes

00:04:27.598 --> 00:04:30.972
how a healthy environment
has animals and insects

00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:34.424
taking up low, medium
and high-frequency bands,

00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:37.642
in exactly the same way
as a symphony does.

00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:42.429
And countless works of music
were inspired by bird and forest song.

00:04:42.972 --> 00:04:47.845
Yes, the natural world
can be our cultural teacher.

00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:52.124
So let's go now to the uniquely
human world of language.

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:56.327
Every language communicates
with pitch to varying degrees,

00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.789
whether it's Mandarin Chinese,

00:04:57.813 --> 00:05:01.805
where a shift in melodic inflection
gives the same phonetic syllable

00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:03.586
an entirely different meaning,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.952
to a language like English,

00:05:04.976 --> 00:05:07.346
where a raised pitch
at the end of a sentence ...

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.388
(Going up in pitch) implies a question?

00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:11.021
(Laughter)

00:05:11.045 --> 00:05:12.704
As an Ethiopian-American woman,

00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:15.136
I grew up around the language
of Amharic, Amhariña.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.639
It was my first language,
the language of my parents,

00:05:17.663 --> 00:05:20.220
one of the main languages of Ethiopia.

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:23.910
And there are a million reasons
to fall in love with this language:

00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:26.775
its depth of poetics,
its double entendres,

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:29.416
its wax and gold, its humor,

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.330
its proverbs that illuminate
the wisdom and follies of life.

00:05:34.038 --> 00:05:38.117
But there's also this melodicism,
a musicality built right in.

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:40.609
And I find this distilled most clearly

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:43.106
in what I like to call
emphatic language --

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.366
language that's meant
to highlight or underline

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.445
or that springs from surprise.

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:50.443
Take, for example, the word: "indey."

00:05:51.204 --> 00:05:53.306
Now, if there are Ethiopians
in the audience,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.337
they're probably chuckling to themselves,

00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:57.445
because the word means
something like "No!"

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:59.280
or "How could he?" or "No, he didn't."

00:05:59.304 --> 00:06:01.405
It kind of depends on the situation.

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:05.280
But when I was a kid,
this was my very favorite word,

00:06:05.304 --> 00:06:08.404
and I think it's because it has a pitch.

00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:09.932
It has a melody.

00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:12.957
You can almost see the shape
as it springs from someone's mouth.

00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:15.710
"Indey" -- it dips, and then raises again.

00:06:16.391 --> 00:06:19.480
And as a musician and composer,
when I hear that word,

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:22.573
something like this
is floating through my mind.

00:06:23.982 --> 00:06:28.982
(Music and singing "Indey")

00:06:33.832 --> 00:06:35.832
(Music ends)

00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:40.702
Or take, for example, the phrase
for "It is right" or "It is correct" --

00:06:40.726 --> 00:06:42.298
"Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu."

00:06:42.322 --> 00:06:44.955
It's an affirmation, an agreement.

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.137
"Lickih nehu."

00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:47.313
When I hear that phrase,

00:06:47.337 --> 00:06:50.834
something like this starts rolling
through my mind.

00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:57.031
(Music and singing "Lickih nehu")

00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:01.572
(Music ends)

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.016
And in both of those cases,
what I did was I took the melody

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.499
and the phrasing
of those words and phrases

00:07:07.523 --> 00:07:12.089
and I turned them into musical parts
to use in these short compositions.

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:14.020
And I like to write bass lines,

00:07:14.044 --> 00:07:16.095
so they both ended up
kind of as bass lines.

00:07:17.387 --> 00:07:20.013
Now, this is based on the work
of Jason Moran and others

00:07:20.037 --> 00:07:23.075
who work intimately
with music and language,

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:26.043
but it's also something I've had
in my head since I was a kid,

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:28.098
how musical my parents sounded

00:07:28.122 --> 00:07:31.274
when they were speaking
to each other and to us.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.444
It was from them
and from Amhariña that I learned

00:07:34.468 --> 00:07:37.348
that we are awash in musical expression

00:07:37.372 --> 00:07:39.987
with every word,
every sentence that we speak,

00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:42.763
every word, every sentence
that we receive.

00:07:42.787 --> 00:07:47.046
Perhaps you can hear it
in the words I'm speaking even now.

00:07:48.237 --> 00:07:50.652
Finally, we go to the 1950s United States

00:07:50.676 --> 00:07:54.587
and the most seminal work
of 20th century avant-garde composition:

00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:56.735
John Cage's "4:33,"

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:59.993
written for any instrument
or combination of instruments.

00:08:00.912 --> 00:08:04.471
The musician or musicians are invited
to walk onto the stage

00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:07.685
with a stopwatch and open the score,

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:10.640
which was actually purchased
by the Museum of Modern Art --

00:08:10.664 --> 00:08:12.046
the score, that is.

00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:16.149
And this score has not
a single note written

00:08:16.173 --> 00:08:18.647
and there is not a single note played

00:08:18.671 --> 00:08:21.403
for four minutes and 33 seconds.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.230
And, at once enraging and enrapturing,

00:08:27.254 --> 00:08:30.142
Cage shows us that even
when there are no strings

00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:35.214
being plucked by fingers
or hands hammering piano keys,

00:08:35.238 --> 00:08:37.715
still there is music,
still there is music,

00:08:37.739 --> 00:08:39.801
still there is music.

00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:41.953
And what is this music?

00:08:42.903 --> 00:08:45.108
It was that sneeze in the back.

00:08:45.132 --> 00:08:46.678
(Laughter)

00:08:46.702 --> 00:08:51.762
It is the everyday soundscape
that arises from the audience themselves:

00:08:51.787 --> 00:08:56.056
their coughs, their sighs, their rustles,
their whispers, their sneezes,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.621
the room, the wood
of the floors and the walls

00:08:58.645 --> 00:09:01.103
expanding and contracting,
creaking and groaning

00:09:01.127 --> 00:09:02.531
with the heat and the cold,

00:09:02.555 --> 00:09:05.646
the pipes clanking and contributing.

00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:10.946
And controversial though it was,
and even controversial though it remains,

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:15.214
Cage's point is that there is no
such thing as true silence.

00:09:16.107 --> 00:09:20.612
Even in the most silent environments,
we still hear and feel the sound

00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:22.163
of our own heartbeats.

00:09:22.646 --> 00:09:25.814
The world is alive
with musical expression.

00:09:26.383 --> 00:09:28.590
We are already immersed.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.023
Now, I had my own moment of,
let's say, remixing John Cage

00:09:34.047 --> 00:09:35.714
a couple of months ago

00:09:35.738 --> 00:09:38.741
when I was standing
in front of the stove cooking lentils.

00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:41.907
And it was late one night
and it was time to stir,

00:09:41.931 --> 00:09:43.903
so I lifted the lid off the cooking pot,

00:09:43.927 --> 00:09:46.360
and I placed it onto
the kitchen counter next to me,

00:09:46.384 --> 00:09:48.647
and it started to roll back and forth

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:51.432
making this sound.

00:09:52.765 --> 00:09:57.765
(Sound of metal lid
clanking against a counter)

00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:00.079
(Clanking ends)

00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:03.059
And it stopped me cold.

00:10:03.727 --> 00:10:08.950
I thought, "What a weird, cool swing
that cooking pan lid has."

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.784
So when the lentils were ready and eaten,

00:10:14.808 --> 00:10:18.302
I hightailed it to my backyard studio,

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.169
and I made this.

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:26.187
(Music, including the sound
of the lid, and singing)

00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:39.421
(Music ends)

00:10:40.479 --> 00:10:42.891
Now, John Cage
wasn't instructing musicians

00:10:42.915 --> 00:10:46.610
to mine the soundscape
for sonic textures to turn into music.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.913
He was saying that on its own,

00:10:49.937 --> 00:10:53.398
the environment is musically generative,

00:10:53.422 --> 00:10:57.663
that it is generous, that it is fertile,

00:10:57.687 --> 00:10:59.850
that we are already immersed.

00:11:00.765 --> 00:11:06.778
Musician, music researcher, surgeon
and human hearing expert Charles Limb

00:11:06.802 --> 00:11:08.857
is a professor at Johns Hopkins University

00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:11.150
and he studies music and the brain.

00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:14.505
And he has a theory

00:11:15.735 --> 00:11:18.831
that it is possible -- it is possible --

00:11:18.855 --> 00:11:24.003
that the human auditory system
actually evolved to hear music,

00:11:24.027 --> 00:11:29.098
because it is so much more complex
than it needs to be for language alone.

00:11:29.733 --> 00:11:31.508
And if that's true,

00:11:31.532 --> 00:11:34.477
it means that we're hard-wired for music,

00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:36.614
that we can find it anywhere,

00:11:36.638 --> 00:11:39.716
that there is no such thing
as a musical desert,

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.439
that we are permanently
hanging out at the oasis,

00:11:43.463 --> 00:11:45.520
and that is marvelous.

00:11:46.135 --> 00:11:49.328
We can add to the soundtrack,
but it's already playing.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.114
And it doesn't mean don't study music.

00:11:52.138 --> 00:11:56.634
Study music, trace your sonic lineages
and enjoy that exploration.

00:11:57.355 --> 00:12:01.090
But there is a kind of sonic lineage
to which we all belong.

00:12:02.267 --> 00:12:04.890
So the next time you are seeking
percussion inspiration,

00:12:04.914 --> 00:12:08.263
look no further than your tires,
as they roll over the unusual grooves

00:12:08.287 --> 00:12:10.011
of the freeway,

00:12:10.035 --> 00:12:12.213
or the top-right burner of your stove

00:12:12.237 --> 00:12:13.946
and that strange way that it clicks

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:16.032
as it is preparing to light.

00:12:16.733 --> 00:12:18.345
When seeking melodic inspiration,

00:12:18.369 --> 00:12:21.861
look no further than dawn
and dusk avian orchestras

00:12:21.885 --> 00:12:25.113
or to the natural lilt
of emphatic language.

00:12:25.137 --> 00:12:28.136
We are the audience
and we are the composers

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.955
and we take from these pieces

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:31.130
we are given.

00:12:31.154 --> 00:12:33.022
We make, we make, we make, we make,

00:12:33.046 --> 00:12:37.466
knowing that when it comes to nature
or language or soundscape,

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.487
there is no end to the inspiration --

00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:42.945
if we are listening.

00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:44.573
Thank you.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:50.371
