00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.897
Father Daniel Berrigan once said
that "writing about prisoners

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.034
is a little like writing about the dead."

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.910
I think what he meant is that
we treat prisoners as ghosts.

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:13.001
They're unseen and unheard.

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:15.317
It's easy to simply ignore them

00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:19.730
and it's even easier when the government
goes to great lengths to keep them hidden.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:21.969
As a journalist, I think these stories

00:00:21.993 --> 00:00:25.041
of what people in power do
when no one is watching,

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:27.492
are precisely the stories
that we need to tell.

00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:29.597
That's why I began investigating

00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:33.408
the most secretive and experimental
prison units in the United States,

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:36.198
for so-called "second-tier" terrorists.

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:42.507
The government calls these units
Communications Management Units or CMUs.

00:00:42.858 --> 00:00:45.967
Prisoners and guards call them
"Little Guantanamo."

00:00:46.886 --> 00:00:49.179
They are islands unto themselves.

00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:53.550
But unlike Gitmo they exist
right here, at home,

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:56.420
floating within larger federal prisons.

00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:58.929
There are 2 CMUs.

00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:02.073
One was opened inside the prison
in Terre Haute, Indiana,

00:01:02.097 --> 00:01:05.781
and the other is inside this prison,
in Marion, Illinois.

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:09.094
Neither of them underwent
the formal review process

00:01:09.118 --> 00:01:12.294
that is required by law
when they were opened.

00:01:13.232 --> 00:01:15.697
CMU prisoners have all
been convicted of crimes.

00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:20.189
Some of their cases are questionable
and some involve threats and violence.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.047
I'm not here to argue the guilt
or innocence of any prisoner.

00:01:24.388 --> 00:01:27.923
I'm here because as Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall said,

00:01:27.947 --> 00:01:30.404
"When the prisons and gates slam shut,

00:01:30.428 --> 00:01:33.030
prisoners do not lose
their human quality."

00:01:34.515 --> 00:01:39.182
Every prisoner I've interviewed
has said there are three flecks of light

00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:41.640
in the darkness of prison:

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:42.862
phone calls,

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:44.037
letters

00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:45.501
and visits from family.

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:50.069
CMUs aren't solitary confinement,
but they radically restrict all of these

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:53.992
to levels that meet or exceed the most
extreme prisons in the United States.

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:57.777
Their phone calls can be limited
to 45 minutes a month,

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:01.469
compared to the 300 minutes
other prisoners receive.

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:05.083
Their letters can be limited
to six pieces of paper.

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:07.947
Their visits can be limited
to four hours per month,

00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:13.677
compared to the 35 hours that people
like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:15.321
receive in the supermax.

00:02:16.215 --> 00:02:21.203
On top of that, CMU visits are non-contact
which means prisoners are not allowed

00:02:21.227 --> 00:02:23.141
to even hug their family.

00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:26.019
As one CMU prisoner said,

00:02:26.043 --> 00:02:29.472
"We're not being tortured here,
except psychologically."

00:02:30.893 --> 00:02:33.335
The government won't say
who is imprisoned here.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.377
But through court documents,
open records requests

00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:39.959
and interviews with current
and former prisoners,

00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:43.156
some small windows
into the CMUs have opened.

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:47.087
There's an estimated
60 to 70 prisoners here,

00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:49.384
and they're overwhelmingly Muslim.

00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:52.993
They include people like Dr. Rafil Dhafir,

00:02:53.017 --> 00:02:57.041
who violated the economic sanctions
on Iraq by sending medical supplies

00:02:57.065 --> 00:02:58.599
for the children there.

00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:02.396
They've included people like Yassin Aref.

00:03:02.892 --> 00:03:08.070
Aref and his family fled to New York
from Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees.

00:03:08.094 --> 00:03:11.887
He was arrested in 2004
as part of an FBI sting.

00:03:12.784 --> 00:03:16.258
Aref is an imam and he was asked
to bear witness to a loan,

00:03:16.282 --> 00:03:18.679
which is a tradition in Islamic culture.

00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:22.519
It turned out that one of the people
involved in the loan was trying to enlist

00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:24.907
someone else in a fake attack.

00:03:25.452 --> 00:03:26.822
Aref didn't know.

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:28.831
For that, he was convicted

00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:32.888
of conspiracy to provide material support
to a terrorist group.

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.539
The CMUs also include
some non-Muslim prisoners.

00:03:37.563 --> 00:03:40.366
The guards call them "balancers,"

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.254
meaning they help balance out
the racial numbers,

00:03:43.278 --> 00:03:45.337
in hopes of deflecting law suits.

00:03:46.223 --> 00:03:49.865
These balancers include animal rights
and environmental activists

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.199
like Daniel McGowan.

00:03:51.643 --> 00:03:54.429
McGowan was convicted
of participating in two arsons

00:03:54.453 --> 00:03:56.565
in the name of defending the environment

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:58.922
as part of the Earth Liberation Front.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.438
During his sentencing, he was afraid
that he would be sent

00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:04.831
to a rumored secret prison for terrorists.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.424
The judge dismissed all those fears,

00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:10.049
saying that they
weren't supported by any facts.

00:04:10.606 --> 00:04:13.861
But that might be because the government
hasn't fully explained

00:04:13.885 --> 00:04:16.287
why some prisoners end up in a CMU,

00:04:16.311 --> 00:04:19.332
and who is responsible
for these decisions.

00:04:20.142 --> 00:04:22.177
When McGowan was transferred, he was told

00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:25.603
it's because he is a "domestic terrorist,"

00:04:25.627 --> 00:04:30.198
a term the FBI uses repeatedly when
talking about environmental activists.

00:04:30.978 --> 00:04:34.749
Now, keep in mind there are about 400
prisoners in US prisons

00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:36.536
who are classified as terrorists,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.654
and only a handful of them
are in the CMUs.

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.792
In McGowan's case, he was previously
at a low-security prison

00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:45.939
and he had no communications violations.

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:48.990
So, why was he moved?

00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:51.510
Like other CMU prisoners,

00:04:51.534 --> 00:04:55.424
McGowan repeatedly asked
for an answer, a hearing,

00:04:55.448 --> 00:04:57.766
or some opportunity for an appeal.

00:04:58.434 --> 00:05:02.688
This example from another prisoner
shows how those requests are viewed.

00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:06.218
"Wants a transfer." "Told him no."

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:11.093
At one point, the prison warden himself
recommended McGowan's transfer

00:05:11.117 --> 00:05:14.390
out of the CMU citing his good behavior,

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.455
but the warden was overruled

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.693
by the Bureau of Prison's
Counterterrorism Unit,

00:05:19.717 --> 00:05:22.671
working with the Joint Terrorism
Task Force of the FBI.

00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:26.187
Later I found out that McGowan
was really sent to a CMU

00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:28.130
not because of what he did,

00:05:28.154 --> 00:05:29.691
but what he has said.

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:35.467
A memo from the Counterterrorism Unit
cited McGowan's "anti-government beliefs."

00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:39.844
While imprisoned, he continued writing
about environmental issues,

00:05:39.868 --> 00:05:42.686
saying that activists must
reflect on their mistakes

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.257
and listen to each other.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.021
Now, in fairness, if you've spent
any time at all in Washington, DC,

00:05:48.045 --> 00:05:52.384
you know this is really a radical
concept for the government.

00:05:52.408 --> 00:05:53.652
(Laughter)

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.747
I actually asked to visit
McGowan in the CMU.

00:05:58.328 --> 00:05:59.732
And I was approved.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.554
That came as quite a shock.

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:07.579
First, because as I've discussed
on this stage before,

00:06:07.603 --> 00:06:10.900
I learned that the FBI has been
monitoring my work.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.459
Second, because it would make me the first
and only journalist to visit a CMU.

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:18.347
I had even learned

00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:21.577
through the Bureau of Prisons
Counterterrorism Unit,

00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:26.256
that they had been monitoring my speeches
about CMUs, like this one.

00:06:27.128 --> 00:06:30.590
So how could I possibly
be approved to visit?

00:06:31.222 --> 00:06:35.431
A few days before I went
out to the prison, I got an answer.

00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:40.836
I was allowed to visit McGowan
as a friend, not a journalist.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.601
Journalists are not allowed here.

00:06:42.972 --> 00:06:46.517
McGowan was told by CMU officials
that if I asked any questions

00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:48.460
or published any story,

00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:51.319
that he would be punished
for my reporting.

00:06:52.308 --> 00:06:54.772
When I arrived for our visit,
the guards reminded me

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:57.070
that they knew who I was
and knew about my work.

00:06:57.094 --> 00:06:59.674
And they said that if I attempted
to interview McGowan,

00:06:59.698 --> 00:07:01.375
the visit would be terminated.

00:07:02.671 --> 00:07:08.168
The Bureau of Prisons describes CMUs
as "self-contained housing units."

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:12.276
But I think that's an Orwellian way
of describing black holes.

00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:13.957
When you visit a CMU,

00:07:13.981 --> 00:07:17.107
you go through all the security
checkpoints that you would expect.

00:07:17.131 --> 00:07:20.246
But then the walk
to the visitation room is silent.

00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:26.227
When a CMU prisoner has a visit,
the rest of the prison is on lockdown.

00:07:27.112 --> 00:07:28.938
I was ushered into a small room,

00:07:28.962 --> 00:07:32.450
so small my outstretched arms
could touch each wall.

00:07:32.761 --> 00:07:35.556
There was a grapefruit-sized
orb in the ceiling

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.755
for the visit to be live-monitored
by the Counterterrorism Unit

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:40.228
in West Virginia.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.999
The unit insists that all the visits
have to be in English for CMU prisoners,

00:07:45.023 --> 00:07:48.221
which is an additional hardship
for many of the Muslim families.

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:52.016
There is a thick sheet of foggy,
bulletproof glass

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.298
and on the other side was Daniel McGowan.

00:07:56.104 --> 00:07:58.962
We spoke through these handsets
attached to the wall

00:07:58.986 --> 00:08:01.310
and talked about books and movies.

00:08:01.334 --> 00:08:03.958
We did our best to find reasons to laugh.

00:08:04.554 --> 00:08:07.721
To fight boredom and amuse himself
while in the CMU,

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:11.825
McGowan had been spreading a rumor
that I was secretly the president

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:15.820
of a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC

00:08:15.844 --> 00:08:17.399
(Laughter)

00:08:17.836 --> 00:08:20.185
For the record, I'm not.

00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:21.449
(Laughter)

00:08:21.754 --> 00:08:25.352
But I kind of the hope the FBI
now thinks that Bella and Edward

00:08:25.376 --> 00:08:27.522
are terrorist code names.

00:08:27.546 --> 00:08:29.056
(Laughter)

00:08:30.073 --> 00:08:36.515
During our visit, McGowan spoke most
and at length about his niece Lily,

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:42.663
his wife Jenny and how torturous
it feels to never be able to hug them,

00:08:42.687 --> 00:08:44.917
to never be able to hold their hands.

00:08:46.227 --> 00:08:49.750
Three months after our visit, McGowan
was transferred out of the CMU

00:08:49.774 --> 00:08:52.790
and then, without warning,
he was sent back again.

00:08:53.956 --> 00:08:58.196
I had published leaked
CMU documents on my website

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.441
and the Counterterrorism Unit said
that McGowan had called his wife

00:09:01.465 --> 00:09:03.751
and asked her to mail them.

00:09:04.307 --> 00:09:07.040
He wanted to see what the government
was saying about him,

00:09:07.064 --> 00:09:09.672
and for that he was sent back to the CMU.

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:12.632
When he was finally released
at the end of his sentence,

00:09:12.656 --> 00:09:14.738
his story got even more Kafkaesque.

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:17.974
He wrote an article
for the Huffington Post headlined,

00:09:17.998 --> 00:09:21.699
"Court Documents Prove I was Sent to
a CMU for my Political Speech."

00:09:22.122 --> 00:09:28.037
The next day he was thrown
back in jail for his political speech.

00:09:28.923 --> 00:09:30.956
His attorneys quickly secured his release,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.578
but the message was very clear:

00:09:33.602 --> 00:09:35.301
Don't talk about this place.

00:09:36.472 --> 00:09:41.065
Today, nine years after they were opened
by the Bush administration,

00:09:41.089 --> 00:09:45.682
the government is codifying
how and why CMUs were created.

00:09:45.706 --> 00:09:47.378
According to the Bureau of Prisons,

00:09:47.402 --> 00:09:51.376
they are for prisoners
with "inspirational significance."

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:56.529
I think that is very nice way of saying
these are political prisons

00:09:56.553 --> 00:09:58.137
for political prisoners.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:01.520
Prisoners are sent to a CMU
because of their race,

00:10:01.544 --> 00:10:04.191
their religion or their
political beliefs.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.591
Now, if you think that
characterization is too strong,

00:10:07.615 --> 00:10:10.432
just look at some
of the government's own documents.

00:10:10.456 --> 00:10:14.972
When some of McGowan's mail was rejected
by the CMU, the sender was told

00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:18.610
it's because the letters were intended
"for political prisoners."

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.228
When another prisoner, animal rights
activist Andy Stepanian,

00:10:23.252 --> 00:10:28.641
was sent to a CMU, it was because of his
anti-government and anti-corporate views.

00:10:29.722 --> 00:10:32.692
Now, I know all of this
may be hard to believe,

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:36.674
that it's happening right now,
and in the United States.

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:40.795
But the unknown reality
is that the US has a dark history

00:10:40.819 --> 00:10:45.210
of disproportionately punishing people
because of their political beliefs.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:50.116
In the 1960s, before Marion
was home to the CMU,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.021
it was home to the notorious Control Unit.

00:10:53.574 --> 00:10:57.523
Prisoners were locked down
in solitary for 22 hours a day.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.946
The warden said the unit
was to "control revolutionary attitudes."

00:11:04.846 --> 00:11:09.793
In the 1980s, another experiment called
the Lexington High Security Unit

00:11:09.817 --> 00:11:12.245
held women connected
to the Weather Underground,

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:15.535
Black Liberation and Puerto Rican
independent struggles.

00:11:15.987 --> 00:11:20.233
The prison radically restricted
communication and used sleep deprivation,

00:11:20.257 --> 00:11:24.854
and constant light for so-called
"ideological conversion."

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:31.068
Those prisons were eventually shut down,
but only through the campaigning

00:11:31.092 --> 00:11:35.493
of religious groups and human rights
advocates, like Amnesty International.

00:11:36.398 --> 00:11:40.324
Today, civil rights lawyers
with the Center for Constitutional Rights

00:11:40.348 --> 00:11:42.727
are challenging CMUs in court

00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:45.306
for depriving prisoners
of their due process rights

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.410
and for retaliating against them

00:11:47.434 --> 00:11:50.744
for their protected political
and religious speech.

00:11:51.296 --> 00:11:54.964
Many of these documents would have
never come to light without this lawsuit.

00:11:56.398 --> 00:12:01.029
The message of these groups
and my message for you today

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:04.809
is that we must bear witness
to what is being done to these prisoners.

00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:09.876
Their treatment is a reflection
of the values held beyond prison walls.

00:12:10.339 --> 00:12:12.955
This story is not just about prisoners.

00:12:12.979 --> 00:12:15.003
It is about us.

00:12:15.027 --> 00:12:17.774
It is about our own commitment
to human rights.

00:12:17.798 --> 00:12:22.523
It is about whether we will choose to stop
repeating the mistakes of our past.

00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:28.109
If we don't listen to what Father Berrigan
described as the stories of the dead,

00:12:28.133 --> 00:12:30.596
they will soon become
the stories of ourselves.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.050
Thank you.

00:12:32.074 --> 00:12:34.772
(Applause)

00:12:39.437 --> 00:12:41.437
(Applause ends)

00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:43.684
Tom Rielly: I have a couple questions.

00:12:43.708 --> 00:12:47.636
When I was in high school,
I learned about the Bill of Rights,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.556
the Constitution, freedom of speech,

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.113
due process and 
about 25 other laws and rights

00:12:55.137 --> 00:12:56.921
that seem to be violated by this.

00:12:57.706 --> 00:13:00.410
How could this possibly be happening?

00:13:00.434 --> 00:13:03.125
Will Potter: I think that's
the number one question I get

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:05.136
throughout all of my work,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.294
and the short answer is
that people don't know.

00:13:08.809 --> 00:13:12.700
I think the solution to any of these types
of situations, any rights abuses,

00:13:12.724 --> 00:13:14.417
are really dependent on two things.

00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:17.237
They're dependent on knowledge
that it's actually happening

00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:21.543
and then a means and efficacy
to actually make a change.

00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:23.964
And unfortunately with these prisoners,

00:13:23.988 --> 00:13:26.563
one, people don't know
what's happening at all

00:13:26.587 --> 00:13:29.175
and then they're already
disenfranchised populations

00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:33.231
who don't have access to attorneys,
not native English speakers.

00:13:33.255 --> 00:13:36.665
In some of these cases, they have great
representation that I mentioned,

00:13:36.689 --> 00:13:39.751
but there's just not a public awareness
of what's happening.

00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:42.815
TR: Isn't it guaranteed in prison
that you have right to council

00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:44.380
or access to council?

00:13:44.404 --> 00:13:46.186
WP: There's a tendency in our culture

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.320
to see when people have been
convicted of a crime,

00:13:49.344 --> 00:13:51.702
no matter if that charge
was bogus or legitimate,

00:13:51.726 --> 00:13:54.692
that whatever happens to them
after that is warranted.

00:13:54.716 --> 00:13:58.210
And I think that's a really damaging
and dangerous narrative that we have,

00:13:58.234 --> 00:14:00.694
that allows these types
of things to happen,

00:14:00.718 --> 00:14:04.121
as the general public just
kind of turns a blind eye to it.

00:14:04.145 --> 00:14:09.081
TR: All those documents on screen
were all real documents, word for word,

00:14:09.105 --> 00:14:11.154
unchanged at all, right?

00:14:11.178 --> 00:14:14.514
WP: Absolutely. I've actually uploaded
all of them to my website.

00:14:14.538 --> 00:14:19.415
It's willpotter.com/CMU and it's
a footnoted version of the talk,

00:14:19.439 --> 00:14:22.757
so you can see the documents for yourself
without the little snippets.

00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:24.169
You can see the full version.

00:14:24.193 --> 00:14:27.138
I relied overwhelmingly
on primary source documents

00:14:27.162 --> 00:14:30.478
or on primary interviews
with former and current prisoners,

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:33.288
with people that are dealing
with this situation every day.

00:14:33.312 --> 00:14:35.630
And like I said, I've been
there myself, as well.

00:14:35.654 --> 00:14:37.360
TR: You're doing courageous work.

00:14:37.384 --> 00:14:39.540
WP: Thank you very much. Thank you all.

00:14:39.564 --> 00:14:42.256
(Applause)
