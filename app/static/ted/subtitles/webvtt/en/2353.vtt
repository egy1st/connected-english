00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.735
So this right here

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.816
is the tiny village of Elle,
close to Lista.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.200
It's right at the southernmost
tip of Norway.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.736
And on January 2 this year,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.976
an elderly guy who lives in the village,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.896
he went out to see what was cast ashore

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.520
during a recent storm.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.296
And on a patch of grass
right next to the water's edge,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320
he found a wetsuit.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.320
It was grey and black,
and he thought it looked cheap.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.296
Out of each leg of the wetsuit

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320
there were sticking two white bones.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.320
It was clearly the remains
of a human being.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.296
And usually, in Norway,
dead people are identified quickly.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.856
So the police started searching

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.976
through missing reports
from the local area,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.216
national missing reports,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.696
and looked for accidents
with a possible connection.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.920
They found nothing.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.416
So they ran a DNA profile,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.576
and they started searching
internationally through Interpol.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800
Nothing.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.760
This was a person
that nobody seemed to be missing.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.160
It was an invisible life
heading for a nameless grave.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.736
But then, after a month,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.056
the police in Norway got a message
from the police in the Netherlands.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.696
A couple of months earlier,
they had found a body,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.000
in an identical wetsuit,
and they had no idea who this person was.

00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:28.696
But the police in the Netherlands
managed to trace the wetsuit

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.096
by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.296
So they were then able to tell

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.656
that both wetsuits were bought
by the same customer at the same time,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.136
October 7, 2014,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.760
in the French city of Calais
by the English Channel.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.936
But this was all
they were able to figure out.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.616
The customer paid cash.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.256
There was no surveillance
footage from the shop.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.760
So it became a cold case.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.056
We heard this story,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.319
and it triggered me and my colleague,
photographer Tomm Christiansen,

00:02:00.343 --> 00:02:03.416
and we of course had the obvious question:
who were these people?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.440
At the time, I'd barely
heard about Calais,

00:02:05.464 --> 00:02:08.295
but it took about two
or three seconds to figure out

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.256
Calais is basically known for two things.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.096
It's the spot in continental Europe
closest to Britain,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.656
and a lot of migrants and refugees
are staying in this camp

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.896
and are trying desperately
to cross over to Britain.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.856
And right there was a plausible theory
about the identity of the two people,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.256
and the police made this theory as well.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.471
Because if you or I or anybody else
with a firm connection to Europe

00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:34.696
goes missing off the coast of France,
people would just know.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.976
Your friends or family
would report you missing,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.776
the police would come search for you,
the media would know,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.056
and there would be
pictures of you on lampposts.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.128
It's difficult to disappear
without a trace.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.976
But if you just fled the war in Syria,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.976
and your family,
if you have any family left,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.056
don't necessarily know where you are,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.096
and you're staying here illegally

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.960
amongst thousands of others
who come and go every day.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.120
Well, if you disappear one day,
nobody will notice.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.886
The police won't come search for you
because nobody knows you're gone.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.896
And this is what happened
to Shadi Omar Kataf

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.240
and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.

00:03:12.768 --> 00:03:15.816
Me and Tomm went to Calais
for the first time in April this year,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.176
and after three months of investigation,
we were able to tell the story

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.976
about how these two young men
fled the war in Syria,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.736
ended up stuck in Calais,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.136
bought wetsuits and drowned
in what seems to have been an attempt

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.120
to swim across the English Channel
in order to reach England.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.496
It is a story about the fact
that everybody has a name,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.960
everybody has a story,
everybody is someone.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.096
But it is also a story about what
it's like to be a refugee in Europe today.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.056
So this is where we started our search.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.576
This is in Calais.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.696
Right now, between 3,500
and 5,000 people are living here

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.296
under horrible conditions.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.296
It has been dubbed
the worst refugee camp in Europe.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.376
Limited access to food,
limited access to water,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.896
limited access to health care.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.200
Disease and infections are widespread.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.096
And they're all stuck here
because they're trying to get to England

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.536
in order to claim asylum.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.096
And they do that by hiding in the back
of trucks headed for the ferry,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.320
or the Eurotunnel,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.776
or they sneak inside
the tunnel terminal at night

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.680
to try to hide on the trains.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.456
Most want to go to Britain
because they know the language,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.976
and so they figure it would be easier
to restart their lives from there.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.816
They want to work, they want to study,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.976
they want to be able
to continue their lives.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.936
A lot of these people are
highly educated and skilled workers.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.496
If you go to Calais and talk to refugees,
you'll meet lawyers, politicians,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.176
engineers, graphic designers,
farmers, soldiers.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.629
You've got the whole spectrum.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.896
But who all of these people are

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.376
usually gets lost in the way
we talk about refugees and migrants,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.416
because we usually do that in statistics.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.616
So you have 60 million refugees globally.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.656
About half a million
have made the crossing

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.136
over the Mediterranean
into Europe so far this year,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.416
and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.936
But these are numbers,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.776
and the numbers don't say anything
about who these people are,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.280
where they came from, or why they're here.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.879
And first, I want to tell you
about one of them.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.096
This is 22-year-old
Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.016
We first heard about him
after being in Calais the first time

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.816
looking for answers to the theory
of the two dead bodies.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.976
And after a while, we heard this story

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.296
about a Syrian man
who was living in Bradford in England,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.096
and had been desperately searching
for his nephew Mouaz for months.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.096
And it turned out the last time
anybody had heard anything from Mouaz

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.776
was October 7, 2014.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.360
That was the same date
the wetsuits were bought.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.376
So we flew over there and we met the uncle

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.496
and we did DNA samples of him,

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.816
and later on got additional DNA samples
from Mouaz's closest relative

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.040
who now lives in Jordan.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.696
The analysis concluded

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.216
the body who was found in a wetsuit
on a beach in the Netherlands

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.160
was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.216
And while we were doing
all this investigation,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.080
we got to know Mouaz's story.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.216
He was born in the Syrian capital
of Damascus in 1991.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.098
He was raised in a middle class family,

00:06:09.122 --> 00:06:11.789
and his father in the middle there
is a chemical engineer

00:06:11.813 --> 00:06:16.096
who spent 11 years in prison for belonging
to the political opposition in Syria.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.736
While his father was in prison,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.016
Mouaz took responsibility
and he cared for his three sisters.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.016
They said he was that kind of guy.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.816
Mouaz studied to become
an electrical engineer

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.416
at the University of Damascus.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.416
So a couple of years into the Syrian war,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.576
the family fled Damascus and went
to the neighboring country, Jordan.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.136
Their father had problems
finding work in Jordan,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.136
and Mouaz could not continue his studies,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.456
so he figured, "OK, the best thing
I can do to help my family

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.216
would be to go somewhere
where I can finish my studies

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.776
and find work."

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.216
So he goes to Turkey.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.880
In Turkey, he's not accepted
at a university,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.216
and once he had left Jordan as a refugee,
he was not allowed to reenter.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.856
So then he decides to head for the UK,

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.416
where his uncle lives.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.576
He makes it into Algeria,
walks into Libya,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.416
pays a people smuggler to help him
with the crossing into Italy by boat,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.336
and from there on he heads to Dunkirk,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.040
the city right next to Calais
by the English Channel.

00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:17.336
We know he made at least 12 failed
attempts to cross the English Channel

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.960
by hiding in a truck.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.200
But at some point,
he must have given up all hope.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.416
The last night we know he was alive,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.960
he spent at a cheap hotel
close to the train station in Dunkirk.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.997
We found his name in the records,
and he seems to have stayed there alone.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.616
The day after, he went into Calais,
entered a sports shop

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.096
a couple of minutes
before 8 o'clock in the evening,

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.656
along with Shadi Kataf.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.696
They both bought wetsuits,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.136
and the woman in the shop

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.732
was the last person we know of
to have seen them alive.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.056
We have tried to figure out
where Shadi met Mouaz,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.496
but we weren't able to do that.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.616
But they do have a similar story.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.536
We first heard about Shadi
after a cousin of his, living in Germany,

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.016
had read an Arabic translation
of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.374
So we got in touch with him.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.456
Shadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.856
was also raised in Damascus.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.416
He was a working kind of guy.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.856
He ran a tire repair shop
and later worked in a printing company.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.776
He lived with his extended family,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.736
but their house got bombed
early in the war.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.680
So the family fled to an area
of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.936
Yarmouk is being described
as the worst place to live

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.159
on planet Earth.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.015
They've been bombed by the military,
they've been besieged,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.421
they've been stormed by ISIS

00:08:41.445 --> 00:08:44.296
and they've been cut off
from supplies for years.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.463
There was a UN official
who visited last year,

00:08:46.487 --> 00:08:51.607
and he said, "They ate all the grass
so there was no grass left."

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.816
Out of a population of 150,000,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.936
only 18,000 are believed
to still be left in Yarmouk.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.016
Shadi and his sisters got out.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.040
The parents are still stuck inside.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.936
So Shadi and one of his sisters,
they fled to Libya.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.627
This was after the fall of Gaddafi,

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.891
but before Libya turned
into full-blown civil war.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.456
And in this last remaining
sort of stability in Libya,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:24.600
Shadi took up scuba diving, and he seemed
to spend most of his time underwater.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.800
He fell completely in love with the ocean,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.896
so when he finally decided
that he could no longer be in Libya,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.176
late August 2014,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.080
he hoped to find work
as a diver when he reached Italy.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.440
Reality was not that easy.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.336
We don't know much about his travels

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.056
because he had a hard time
communicating with his family,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.096
but we do know that he struggled.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.496
And by the end of September,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.806
he was living on the streets
somewhere in France.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.856
On October 7, he calls
his cousin in Belgium,

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.856
and explains his situation.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.056
He said, "I'm in Calais. I need you
to come get my backpack and my laptop.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.016
I can't afford to pay the people smugglers
to help me with the crossing to Britain,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.280
but I will go buy a wetsuit
and I will swim."

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.016
His cousin, of course,
tried to warn him not to,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.176
but Shadi's battery
on the phone went flat,

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.000
and his phone was never switched on again.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.576
What was left of Shadi
was found nearly three months later,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.536
800 kilometers away

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.600
in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.696
He's still waiting
for his funeral in Norway,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.280
and none of his family
will be able to attend.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.616
Many may think that the story
about Shadi and Mouaz

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.440
is a story about death,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.016
but I don't agree.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.496
To me, this is a story about two questions
that I think we all share:

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.296
what is a better life,

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.640
and what am I willing to do to achieve it?

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.536
And to me, and probably a lot of you,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.136
a better life would mean

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.056
being able to do more
of what we think of as meaningful,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.080
whether that be spending more time
with your family and friends,

00:11:02.104 --> 00:11:03.616
travel to an exotic place,

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.976
or just getting money
to buy that cool new device

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.696
or a pair of new sneakers.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.440
And this is all
within our reach pretty easily.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.776
But if you are fleeing a war zone,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.776
the answers to those two questions
are dramatically different.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.056
A better life is a life in safety.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.416
It's a life in dignity.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.096
A better life means
not having your house bombed,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.656
not fearing being kidnapped.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.109
It means being able
to send your children to school,

00:11:29.133 --> 00:11:30.296
go to university,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.736
or just find work to be able to provide
for yourself and the ones you love.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.376
A better life would be
a future of some possibilities

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.696
compared to nearly none,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.480
and that's a strong motivation.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.576
And I have no trouble imagining

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.096
that after spending weeks or even months

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.016
as a second-grade citizen,

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.176
living on the streets
or in a horrible makeshift camp

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.656
with a stupid, racist name
like "The Jungle,"

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.200
most of us would be willing
to do just about anything.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.456
If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.536
the second they stepped into the freezing
waters of the English Channel,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.320
they would probably say,
"This is worth the risk,"

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.120
because they could
no longer see any other option.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.600
And that's desperation,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.800
but that's the reality of living
as a refugee in Western Europe in 2015.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.976
Thank you.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.216
(Applause)

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.550
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Anders.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.816
This is Tomm Christiansen,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.602
who took most of the pictures you have
seen and they've done reporting together.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.056
Tomm, you two have been
back to Calais recently.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.696
This was the third trip.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.776
It was after the publication
of the article.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.936
What has changed?
What have you seen there?

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.389
Tomm Christiansen:
The first time we were in Calais,

00:12:56.413 --> 00:12:58.056
it was about 1,500 refugees there.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.736
They had a difficult time,
but they were positive, they had hope.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.776
The last time, the camp has grown,
maybe four or five thousand people.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.376
It seemed more permanent,
NGOs have arrived,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.216
a small school has opened.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.616
But the thing is that the refugees
have stayed for a longer time,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.536
and the French government has managed
to seal off the borders better,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.616
so now The Jungle is growing,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.856
along with the despair
and hopelessness among the refugees.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.576
BG: Are you planning to go back?
And continue the reporting?

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.816
TC: Yes.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.856
BG: Anders, I'm a former journalist,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.296
and to me, it's amazing
that in the current climate

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.856
of slashing budgets
and publishers in crisis,

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.776
Dagbladet has consented
so many resources for this story,

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.658
which tells a lot about newspapers
taking the responsibility,

00:13:46.682 --> 00:13:48.602
but how did you sell it to your editors?

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.376
Anders Fjellberg: It wasn't easy at first,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.376
because we weren't able to know
what we actually could figure out.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.656
As soon as it became clear

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.136
that we actually could be able
to identify who the first one was,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.216
we basically got the message
that we could do whatever we wanted,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.256
just travel wherever you need to go,
do whatever you need to do,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.400
just get this done.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.056
BG: That's an editor
taking responsibility.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.700
The story, by the way,
has been translated and published

00:14:16.724 --> 00:14:19.976
across several European countries,
and certainly will continue to do.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.536
And we want to read the updates from you.
Thank you Anders. Thank you Tomm.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.960
(Applause)
