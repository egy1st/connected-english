WEBVTT

00:00:01.303 --> 00:00:02.463
A few years ago,

00:00:02.487 --> 00:00:05.257
with my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier,

00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:08.539
I invented a new technology
for editing genomes.

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:11.207
It's called CRISPR-Cas9.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.446
The CRISPR technology allows
scientists to make changes

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.325
to the DNA in cells

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.255
that could allow us
to cure genetic disease.

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:22.688
You might be interested to know

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:26.496
that the CRISPR technology came about
through a basic research project

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.463
that was aimed at discovering
how bacteria fight viral infections.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.212
Bacteria have to deal with viruses
in their environment,

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:37.900
and we can think about a viral infection
like a ticking time bomb --

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:41.282
a bacterium has only a few minutes
to defuse the bomb

00:00:41.306 --> 00:00:42.916
before it gets destroyed.

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:48.674
So, many bacteria have in their cells
an adaptive immune system called CRISPR,

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:52.344
that allows them to detect
viral DNA and destroy it.

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:57.116
Part of the CRISPR system
is a protein called Cas9,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.089
that's able to seek out, cut
and eventually degrade viral DNA

00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:04.375
in a specific way.

00:01:05.054 --> 00:01:06.556
And it was through our research

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.237
to understand the activity
of this protein, Cas9,

00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:13.092
that we realized that we could
harness its function

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:16.522
as a genetic engineering technology --

00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:23.497
a way for scientists to delete or insert
specific bits of DNA into cells

00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:25.552
with incredible precision --

00:01:25.576 --> 00:01:27.243
that would offer opportunities

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:30.339
to do things that really haven't
been possible in the past.

00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:33.246
The CRISPR technology
has already been used

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.354
to change the DNA in the cells
of mice and monkeys,

00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:40.003
other organisms as well.

00:01:40.527 --> 00:01:42.282
Chinese scientists showed recently

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:44.465
that they could even use
the CRISPR technology

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:47.118
to change genes in human embryos.

00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:50.285
And scientists in Philadelphia showed
they could use CRISPR

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:55.152
to remove the DNA
of an integrated HIV virus

00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:57.371
from infected human cells.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:01.348
The opportunity to do this kind
of genome editing

00:02:01.372 --> 00:02:04.655
also raises various ethical issues
that we have to consider,

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.647
because this technology can be employed
not only in adult cells,

00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:11.274
but also in the embryos of organisms,

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:14.298
including our own species.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.765
And so, together with my colleagues,

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:21.277
I've called for a global conversation
about the technology that I co-invented,

00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:25.841
so that we can consider all of the ethical
and societal implications

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:27.589
of a technology like this.

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:32.995
What I want to do now is tell you
what the CRISPR technology is,

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.473
what it can do,

00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:35.742
where we are today

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:38.788
and why I think we need to take
a prudent path forward

00:02:38.812 --> 00:02:41.165
in the way that we employ this technology.

00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:46.831
When viruses infect a cell,
they inject their DNA.

00:02:47.363 --> 00:02:48.839
And in a bacterium,

00:02:48.863 --> 00:02:53.728
the CRISPR system allows that DNA
to be plucked out of the virus,

00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:57.597
and inserted in little bits
into the chromosome --

00:02:57.621 --> 00:02:59.571
the DNA of the bacterium.

00:02:59.937 --> 00:03:05.287
And these integrated bits of viral DNA
get inserted at a site called CRISPR.

00:03:06.032 --> 00:03:12.027
CRISPR stands for clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats.

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:13.052
(Laughter)

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:16.449
A big mouthful -- you can see why
we use the acronym CRISPR.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.878
It's a mechanism that allows cells
to record, over time,

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:23.584
the viruses they have been exposed to.

00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:28.291
And importantly, those bits of DNA
are passed on to the cells' progeny,

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:32.848
so cells are protected from viruses
not only in one generation,

00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:35.221
but over many generations of cells.

00:03:35.245 --> 00:03:39.530
This allows the cells
to keep a record of infection,

00:03:39.554 --> 00:03:42.493
and as my colleague,
Blake Wiedenheft, likes to say,

00:03:42.517 --> 00:03:47.473
the CRISPR locus is effectively
a genetic vaccination card in cells.

00:03:48.572 --> 00:03:53.070
Once those bits of DNA have been inserted
into the bacterial chromosome,

00:03:53.094 --> 00:03:57.293
the cell then makes a little copy
of a molecule called RNA,

00:03:57.317 --> 00:03:59.332
which is orange in this picture,

00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:04.073
that is an exact replicate
of the viral DNA.

00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:06.838
RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA,

00:04:06.862 --> 00:04:10.815
and it allows interaction
with DNA molecules

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.838
that have a matching sequence.

00:04:13.258 --> 00:04:17.167
So those little bits of RNA
from the CRISPR locus

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.980
associate -- they bind --
to protein called Cas9,

00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:22.939
which is white in the picture,

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:27.182
and form a complex that functions
like a sentinel in the cell.

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:30.620
It searches through all
of the DNA in the cell,

00:04:30.644 --> 00:04:34.896
to find sites that match
the sequences in the bound RNAs.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.555
And when those sites are found --

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:40.049
as you can see here,
the blue molecule is DNA --

00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:42.922
this complex associates with that DNA

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:48.248
and allows the Cas9 cleaver
to cut up the viral DNA.

00:04:48.272 --> 00:04:50.628
It makes a very precise break.

00:04:52.096 --> 00:04:56.496
So we can think of the Cas9 RNA
sentinel complex

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.701
like a pair of scissors
that can cut DNA --

00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:02.961
it makes a double-stranded break
in the DNA helix.

00:05:02.985 --> 00:05:06.967
And importantly,
this complex is programmable,

00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:12.191
so it can be programmed to recognize
particular DNA sequences,

00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:15.242
and make a break in the DNA at that site.

00:05:15.928 --> 00:05:17.508
As I'm going to tell you now,

00:05:17.532 --> 00:05:22.308
we recognized that that activity
could be harnessed for genome engineering,

00:05:22.332 --> 00:05:26.559
to allow cells to make
a very precise change to the DNA

00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:29.055
at the site where
this break was introduced.

00:05:29.558 --> 00:05:30.773
That's sort of analogous

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.505
to the way that we use
a word-processing program

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:35.809
to fix a typo in a document.

00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:42.359
The reason we envisioned using
the CRISPR system for genome engineering

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:46.002
is because cells have the ability
to detect broken DNA

00:05:46.026 --> 00:05:47.218
and repair it.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.711
So when a plant or an animal cell detects
a double-stranded break in its DNA,

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:54.332
it can fix that break,

00:05:54.356 --> 00:05:57.883
either by pasting together
the ends of the broken DNA

00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:02.017
with a little, tiny change
in the sequence of that position,

00:06:02.041 --> 00:06:08.324
or it can repair the break by integrating
a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut.

00:06:09.054 --> 00:06:14.027
So if we have a way to introduce
double-stranded breaks into DNA

00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:15.631
at precise places,

00:06:15.655 --> 00:06:18.464
we can trigger cells
to repair those breaks,

00:06:18.488 --> 00:06:23.511
by either the disruption or incorporation
of new genetic information.

00:06:23.936 --> 00:06:27.178
So if we were able to program
the CRISPR technology

00:06:27.202 --> 00:06:29.525
to make a break in DNA

00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:35.818
at the position at or near a mutation
causing cystic fibrosis, for example,

00:06:35.842 --> 00:06:39.347
we could trigger cells
to repair that mutation.

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:45.567
Genome engineering is actually not new,
it's been in development since the 1970s.

00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:48.342
We've had technologies for sequencing DNA,

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:49.961
for copying DNA,

00:06:49.985 --> 00:06:52.365
and even for manipulating DNA.

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:56.105
And these technologies
were very promising,

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.535
but the problem was
that they were either inefficient,

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:02.892
or they were difficult enough to use

00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:07.718
that most scientists had not adopted them
for use in their own laboratories,

00:07:07.742 --> 00:07:11.907
or certainly for many
clinical applications.

00:07:12.722 --> 00:07:19.722
So, the opportunity to take a technology
like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal,

00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:23.102
because of its relative simplicity.

00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:26.895
We can think of older
genome engineering technologies

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:30.578
as similar to having
to rewire your computer

00:07:30.602 --> 00:07:34.372
each time you want to run
a new piece of software,

00:07:34.396 --> 00:07:38.160
whereas the CRISPR technology
is like software for the genome,

00:07:38.184 --> 00:07:41.670
we can program it easily,
using these little bits of RNA.

00:07:42.658 --> 00:07:45.751
So once a double-stranded
break is made in DNA,

00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:47.862
we can induce repair,

00:07:47.886 --> 00:07:51.332
and thereby potentially achieve
astounding things,

00:07:51.356 --> 00:07:55.515
like being able to correct mutations
that cause sickle cell anemia

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:57.890
or cause Huntington's Disease.

00:07:57.914 --> 00:08:01.375
I actually think that the first
applications of the CRISPR technology

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:03.668
are going to happen in the blood,

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:08.445
where it's relatively easier
to deliver this tool into cells,

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:10.590
compared to solid tissues.

00:08:11.905 --> 00:08:14.309
Right now, a lot of the work
that's going on

00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:18.302
applies to animal models
of human disease, such as mice.

00:08:18.326 --> 00:08:21.595
The technology is being used to make
very precise changes

00:08:21.619 --> 00:08:26.790
that allow us to study the way
that these changes in the cell's DNA

00:08:26.814 --> 00:08:31.134
affect either a tissue or,
in this case, an entire organism.

00:08:31.515 --> 00:08:32.722
Now in this example,

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:36.539
the CRISPR technology
was used to disrupt a gene

00:08:36.563 --> 00:08:39.330
by making a tiny change in the DNA

00:08:39.354 --> 00:08:43.798
in a gene that is responsible
for the black coat color of these mice.

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:49.237
Imagine that these white mice
differ from their pigmented litter-mates

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:53.928
by just a tiny change at one gene
in the entire genome,

00:08:53.952 --> 00:08:55.942
and they're otherwise completely normal.

00:08:55.966 --> 00:08:58.857
And when we sequence the DNA
from these animals,

00:08:58.881 --> 00:09:01.507
we find that the change in the DNA

00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:04.673
has occurred at exactly the place
where we induced it,

00:09:04.697 --> 00:09:06.459
using the CRISPR technology.

00:09:07.662 --> 00:09:10.386
Additional experiments
are going on in other animals

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.505
that are useful for creating models
for human disease,

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:16.132
such as monkeys.

00:09:16.156 --> 00:09:19.382
And here we find
that we can use these systems

00:09:19.406 --> 00:09:23.208
to test the application of this technology
in particular tissues,

00:09:23.232 --> 00:09:28.305
for example, figuring out how to deliver
the CRISPR tool into cells.

00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:30.477
We also want to understand better

00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:34.128
how to control the way
that DNA is repaired after it's cut,

00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:39.833
and also to figure out how to control
and limit any kind of off-target,

00:09:39.857 --> 00:09:43.094
or unintended effects
of using the technology.

00:09:44.356 --> 00:09:50.506
I think that we will see
clinical application of this technology,

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.042
certainly in adults,

00:09:52.066 --> 00:09:53.669
within the next 10 years.

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:56.827
I think that it's likely
that we will see clinical trials

00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:00.280
and possibly even approved
therapies within that time,

00:10:00.304 --> 00:10:03.017
which is a very exciting thing
to think about.

00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:05.542
And because of the excitement
around this technology,

00:10:05.566 --> 00:10:08.859
there's a lot of interest
in start-up companies

00:10:08.883 --> 00:10:13.645
that have been founded
to commercialize the CRISPR technology,

00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:15.158
and lots of venture capitalists

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:17.754
that have been investing
in these companies.

00:10:19.242 --> 00:10:20.815
But we have to also consider

00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:24.461
that the CRISPR technology can be used
for things like enhancement.

00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:27.529
Imagine that we could try
to engineer humans

00:10:27.553 --> 00:10:31.988
that have enhanced properties,
such as stronger bones,

00:10:32.012 --> 00:10:36.083
or less susceptibility
to cardiovascular disease

00:10:36.107 --> 00:10:37.618
or even to have properties

00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:40.041
that we would consider maybe
to be desirable,

00:10:40.065 --> 00:10:44.506
like a different eye color
or to be taller, things like that.

00:10:45.942 --> 00:10:47.788
"Designer humans," if you will.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.170
Right now, the genetic information

00:10:51.194 --> 00:10:55.687
to understand what types of genes
would give rise to these traits

00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:57.444
is mostly not known.

00:10:57.468 --> 00:10:58.714
But it's important to know

00:10:58.738 --> 00:11:03.023
that the CRISPR technology gives us a tool
to make such changes,

00:11:03.047 --> 00:11:05.554
once that knowledge becomes available.

00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:10.762
This raises a number of ethical questions
that we have to carefully consider,

00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:15.001
and this is why I and my colleagues
have called for a global pause

00:11:15.025 --> 00:11:19.771
in any clinical application
of the CRISPR technology in human embryos,

00:11:19.795 --> 00:11:20.946
to give us time

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.347
to really consider all of the various
implications of doing so.

00:11:25.743 --> 00:11:29.586
And actually, there is an important
precedent for such a pause

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.929
from the 1970s,

00:11:30.953 --> 00:11:32.817
when scientists got together

00:11:32.841 --> 00:11:36.671
to call for a moratorium
on the use of molecular cloning,

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:42.650
until the safety of that technology
could be tested carefully and validated.

00:11:43.506 --> 00:11:48.646
So, genome-engineered humans
are not with us yet,

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.317
but this is no longer science fiction.

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:56.544
Genome-engineered animals and plants
are happening right now.

00:11:57.069 --> 00:12:01.122
And this puts in front of all of us
a huge responsibility,

00:12:01.146 --> 00:12:05.723
to consider carefully
both the unintended consequences

00:12:05.747 --> 00:12:09.793
as well as the intended impacts
of a scientific breakthrough.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.342
Thank you.

00:12:11.366 --> 00:12:15.366
(Applause)

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.735
(Applause ends)

00:12:21.535 --> 00:12:25.429
Bruno Giussani: Jennifer, this is
a technology with huge consequences,

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.604
as you pointed out.

00:12:26.628 --> 00:12:31.800
Your attitude about asking for a pause
or a moratorium or a quarantine

00:12:31.824 --> 00:12:33.844
is incredibly responsible.

00:12:34.733 --> 00:12:37.281
There are, of course,
the therapeutic results of this,

00:12:37.305 --> 00:12:39.455
but then there are the un-therapeutic ones

00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:41.659
and they seem to be the ones
gaining traction,

00:12:41.683 --> 00:12:42.929
particularly in the media.

00:12:42.953 --> 00:12:47.119
This is one of the latest issues
of The Economist -- "Editing humanity."

00:12:47.143 --> 00:12:50.962
It's all about genetic enhancement,
it's not about therapeutics.

00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:53.823
What kind of reactions
did you get back in March

00:12:53.847 --> 00:12:55.864
from your colleagues in the science world,

00:12:55.888 --> 00:12:57.246
when you asked or suggested

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.586
that we should actually pause this
for a moment and think about it?

00:13:01.054 --> 00:13:04.055
Jennifer Doudna: My colleagues
were actually, I think, delighted

00:13:04.079 --> 00:13:06.324
to have the opportunity
to discuss this openly.

00:13:06.348 --> 00:13:08.694
It's interesting that as I talk to people,

00:13:08.718 --> 00:13:11.186
my scientific colleagues
as well as others,

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.520
there's a wide variety
of viewpoints about this.

00:13:13.544 --> 00:13:17.218
So clearly it's a topic that needs
careful consideration and discussion.

00:13:17.242 --> 00:13:19.457
BG: There's a big meeting
happening in December

00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:21.457
that you and your colleagues are calling,

00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:24.248
together with the National Academy
of Sciences and others,

00:13:24.272 --> 00:13:27.564
what do you hope will come
out of the meeting, practically?

00:13:27.588 --> 00:13:29.954
JD: Well, I hope that we can air the views

00:13:29.978 --> 00:13:33.578
of many different individuals
and stakeholders

00:13:33.602 --> 00:13:37.894
who want to think about how to use
this technology responsibly.

00:13:37.918 --> 00:13:41.020
It may not be possible to come up with
a consensus point of view,

00:13:41.044 --> 00:13:43.037
but I think we should at least understand

00:13:43.061 --> 00:13:45.033
what all the issues are as we go forward.

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:46.463
BG: Now, colleagues of yours,

00:13:46.487 --> 00:13:48.566
like George Church,
for example, at Harvard,

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:52.026
they say, "Yeah, ethical issues basically
are just a question of safety.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.704
We test and test and test again,
in animals and in labs,

00:13:54.728 --> 00:13:58.644
and then once we feel it's safe enough,
we move on to humans."

00:13:58.668 --> 00:14:01.249
So that's kind of the other
school of thought,

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:04.421
that we should actually use
this opportunity and really go for it.

00:14:04.445 --> 00:14:08.223
Is there a possible split happening
in the science community about this?

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:10.707
I mean, are we going to see
some people holding back

00:14:10.731 --> 00:14:12.525
because they have ethical concerns,

00:14:12.549 --> 00:14:14.236
and some others just going forward

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.556
because some countries under-regulate
or don't regulate at all?

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.425
JD: Well, I think with any new technology,
especially something like this,

00:14:21.449 --> 00:14:24.234
there are going to be
a variety of viewpoints,

00:14:24.258 --> 00:14:27.599
and I think that's
perfectly understandable.

00:14:27.623 --> 00:14:29.135
I think that in the end,

00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:34.110
this technology will be used
for human genome engineering,

00:14:34.134 --> 00:14:38.451
but I think to do that without careful
consideration and discussion

00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:41.412
of the risks and potential complications

00:14:41.436 --> 00:14:42.975
would not be responsible.

00:14:42.999 --> 00:14:45.978
BG: There are a lot of technologies
and other fields of science

00:14:46.002 --> 00:14:48.773
that are developing exponentially,
pretty much like yours.

00:14:48.797 --> 00:14:52.830
I'm thinking about artificial
intelligence, autonomous robots and so on.

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:54.366
No one seems --

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.898
aside from autonomous warfare robots --

00:14:56.922 --> 00:15:01.627
nobody seems to have launched
a similar discussion in those fields,

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.061
in calling for a moratorium.

00:15:03.085 --> 00:15:07.156
Do you think that your discussion may
serve as a blueprint for other fields?

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.699
JD: Well, I think it's hard for scientists
to get out of the laboratory.

00:15:10.723 --> 00:15:11.876
Speaking for myself,

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.516
it's a little bit
uncomfortable to do that.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.454
But I do think that being involved
in the genesis of this

00:15:18.478 --> 00:15:22.334
really puts me and my colleagues
in a position of responsibility.

00:15:22.358 --> 00:15:25.788
And I would say that I certainly hope
that other technologies

00:15:25.812 --> 00:15:28.458
will be considered in the same way,

00:15:28.482 --> 00:15:31.880
just as we would want to consider
something that could have implications

00:15:31.904 --> 00:15:33.831
in other fields besides biology.

00:15:33.855 --> 00:15:35.807
BG: Jennifer, thanks for coming to TED.

00:15:35.831 --> 00:15:37.092
JD: Thank you.

00:15:37.116 --> 00:15:40.809
(Applause)
