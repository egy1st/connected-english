00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.240
So what do you see
when you look at a fruit fly?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.776
Probably a nuisance, right?

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.816
Well, I'd agree with you, but I'd also say

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.976
that fruit flies are some
of the smartest creatures on the planet.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.816
And what I found is that fruit flies,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.816
along with some other
organisms in nature,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.896
are really good models for creating
low-cost, autonomous robots.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.576
And so today I'm going to tell you

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.536
about some behaviors in nature
that I find really fascinating,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.016
and then talk about how
I'm applying those behaviors

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.896
to create flying robots like this one,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.086
for search and rescue,
and emergency response.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.136
So all of this started two summers ago,
when my family went to India on vacation.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.616
We were there for about three weeks
and we had a good time,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.856
but when we got back,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.696
we realized we had left some
bananas on the kitchen counter.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.736
So there's this bunch of rotten bananas
sitting on our kitchen counter,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.096
and as a result our house
was filled with fruit flies.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.456
So I kept trying to swat them,
they kept escaping,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.856
and I got really mad.
But then I started to think.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.136
Fruit flies are really tiny,
they probably have a really small brain,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.496
they must have awful vision,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.656
they really don't have
very much of anything.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.736
So what could they possibly be doing
to escape so effectively?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.096
(Laughter)

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.320
And as it turns out --

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.056
the answer is -- a lot.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.810
First, fruit flies take the time
to plan out their escape,

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.456
even when they ultimately decide
to stay where they are.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.056
To carry out this escape,
they first jump to the side,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.416
and then they use their wings
to move vertically.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.936
And all of this happens
within about a third of a second,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.696
so literally in the blink of an eye.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.416
So that's cool, but there's
something more going on here.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.056
Remember how I said
that fruit flies have awful vision?

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.176
Well, that's true
in the conventional sense.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.016
For example, this is how
fruit fly vision compares to ours.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.256
But here's the thing.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.696
Because their eyes
produce such little information,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.056
they can process
that information really quickly,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.176
so they can actually see
10 times faster than we can.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.103
That may be a little hard to visualize,

00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:42.468
so to put it in perspective,

00:01:42.493 --> 00:01:45.453
I slowed down both how fruit flies
would see and how we would see.

00:01:45.478 --> 00:01:47.816
You can see that although
we see in much more detail,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.576
fruit flies can see 10 times faster.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.656
That means they can process all
of that information and all that motion

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.256
and react to that really quickly.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.668
That's really advantageous when they're
trying to escape from something.

00:01:57.693 --> 00:01:58.896
And so in some sense,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.414
fruit flies are so good at escaping
because they have really bad eyesight.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.656
So they can't see a lot,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.256
but that means that they can
process what they can see

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.960
and react to that really quickly.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.776
So around the same time
as this fruit fly incident,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.136
flying robots, or drones,
had been in the news a lot.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.456
And while most of the stories
I read, like these,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.896
talked about how these robots
were crashing into things,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.242
or taking selfies,
or doing generally useless things,

00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:22.496
I also started to read

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.416
about how they may be able to help
after natural disasters.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.696
It turns out that flying robots
are really good,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.696
they're perfect
for these types of applications

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.256
because they're really small
and they're really agile.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.376
So they can go into tight spaces
or they can fly around obstacles.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.456
The problem here is they can't really
react to their environment.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.440
For example, if we have a robot like this

00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:42.860
and it's going into a building
after an earthquake,

00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:44.138
and the ceiling collapses,

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:45.599
then the flying robot is done.

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:47.816
It can't react to that,
it can't respond to that.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.416
So I wanted to see
whether we could make flying robots

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.736
respond to moving threats
like fruit flies do.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.976
And so I wanted to see

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.976
whether I could draw from what I learned
about fruit fly escape

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.396
to make flying robots better.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.336
I spent the next few months

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.507
building prototypes,
and sottering and coding,

00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:04.096
and this is what I came up with.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.736
It's a really tiny, flying robot,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.656
it's about 10 centimeters across,
and I call it FlyBot.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.176
And it has these two
infrared distance sensors,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.816
so those are the eye-looking
things on either side.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.056
And basically,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.216
they periodically bounce
the small amount of infrared light up

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.896
and they measure how much returns.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.300
And based on that, they're able to see
how far something is away from them.

00:03:23.324 --> 00:03:25.808
So I created some algorithms
that use these distances

00:03:25.832 --> 00:03:27.936
so that each of them
returns a single number.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.056
And I created algorithms
that use these numbers -- two numbers --

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.696
to construct a model
of how the threat moves over time.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.816
Based on that,
it actually makes predictions

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.808
about when the threat will hit the robot,

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:40.220
and from that it can decide
when and how to escape.

00:03:40.244 --> 00:03:42.340
And I'd love to give you guys
a demo of this.

00:03:42.365 --> 00:03:44.560
So it'll take me a second to get set up.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.736
And this is a sheet of wood,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.616
so this is what I'm using
to simulate a threat,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.536
but this could be a collapsing ceiling,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.925
or an object that could fall
and damage the drone.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.536
So right now I'm connecting to it,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.776
and once it connects,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.101
I'll be able to show you
how it's able to escape.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.896
OK, so as something approaches,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.656
it's able to detect that
and respond to it really quickly.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.736
And then it mimics
these fruit fly motions.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.536
So it first flies to the side
and then it flies vertically.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.250
Let's see that a couple more times.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.480
I'll catch it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.216
And it can respond
to different things as well.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.896
So if I try to hit it, for example,
it's able to respond that really quickly.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.816
And so again, this could be used
in search and rescue, right?

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.456
So if we have one of these robots

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.896
and it's going into
an earthquake-damaged building,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.136
after an earthquake,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.816
and then it sees something,
and it needs to react to that --

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.856
So if the ceiling collapses
or something falls.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.576
And it's able to respond to that
and continue what it's doing.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.816
So I'm trying to make
flying robots more autonomous.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.336
Here's a comparison
of how my robot is able to escape

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.216
to how fruit flies are able to escape.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.336
This worked really well,
and I wanted to see

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.496
what else we could draw from biology
to make flying robots better.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.696
One of the biggest problems
with flying robots

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.016
is this thing call mapping.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.096
Basically, making
a map of your environment

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.016
so you can see what's around you
and avoid colliding into it.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.056
Again, it turns out that fruit flies
are really good models for this.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.564
So what fruit flies do
is they see in terms of edges.

00:05:14.588 --> 00:05:16.595
They have these four
neurons in their brain

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.151
that track light and dark edges,

00:05:18.175 --> 00:05:20.468
and they use these edges
for a variety of things.

00:05:20.493 --> 00:05:22.896
So if I was a fruit fly
and I wanted to hover here,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.136
I would actually look
for this horizontal edge,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.456
and I would track that
and fly in line with that.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.936
And then fruit flies also use edges
for avoiding collisions.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.816
So edges are a really good way
to simplify your environment

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.936
because you can discard a lot things
you don't really care about,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.176
like color and texture,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.080
while keeping things you do care about
which are obstacles.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.056
Birds are really good models for mapping,
or for perception, as well.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.776
So what birds have, as you can see,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.296
they have their eyes
on opposite sides of their head.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.736
Rather than doing what we do,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.896
which is using both
of our eyes to see depth,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.896
birds have to use each eye independently.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.642
They can't combine their eyes at all

00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:59.070
because their eyes
see completely different things.

00:05:59.094 --> 00:06:00.256
So what birds do

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.176
is they actually look at how objects
become bigger over time.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.536
So if I was a bird, I guess,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.416
as I get closer to something,
I'd see how it becomes bigger,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.600
and I would actually use that
to see where it is in my environment.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.496
And so to mimic this I created
an algorithm for flying robots.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.736
It's really fast,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.736
it actually can process
81 camera images per second.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.016
And what this does is

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.936
it uses a single two-dimensional camera

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.376
to make a map of
a three-dimensional environment.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.616
So here you can see,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.816
this is an example
of a cluttered environment.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.776
It's a cluttered lab at Carnegie Mellon.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.856
So first I find edges in that environment,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.976
and then I detect
and associate those edges.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.096
So I say that's the left edge
of an obstacle, and that's the right edge.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.048
Then I look at how
they expand over time,

00:06:40.072 --> 00:06:42.555
or how they move apart over time,
just like birds do,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.207
to find where those obstacles are.

00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:45.524
And this works really well.

00:06:45.548 --> 00:06:48.816
So it's really fast,
it can process 81 images per second,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.696
and it also works really effectively.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.520
So here's a video of how that works.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.456
And so you can see that it's
able to use the expansion of edges.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.056
And edges are everywhere --

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.456
every object has edges.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.856
It's able to use
the expansion of those edges

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.840
to detect and respond to a variety
of obstacles in this really cluttered lab.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.576
So again that worked really well.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.696
I was able to look
at fruit flies, initially,

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.416
and then also birds later on,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.216
and both of those worked really well.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.456
So I wanted to see

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.416
whether we could solve other problems
with flying robots based on biology.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.496
So one of the things I was thinking about

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.176
was that right now I had done
these things with escaping

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.616
and with avoiding obstacles,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.016
but that actually
doesn't do very much for people.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.416
So if I give a firefighter, for example,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.656
one of these drones,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.936
then they really
can't do anything with it.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.816
So it really doesn't find anything.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.216
And so one of the questions I asked was,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.656
what if we had a flying robot
that could actually find things?

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.576
So for example, we could send
this robot into a burning building

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.656
and it could find where the fire is,
find someone who's trapped.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.576
Again it turns out that fruit flies
are really good models for this,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.568
and I don't even like fruit flies,
I find them really annoying.

00:08:00.593 --> 00:08:02.736
But they're good
at almost everything they do.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.696
And so one of the really cool
things about fruit flies

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.296
is they're able to zero in
on bananas really well.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.656
And it turns out,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.856
oftentimes they can't even smell that
when they start out.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.616
And so what they do is they look
for these bright yellow objects

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.856
that could be bananas,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.176
and they go closer to them

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.056
and start smelling them
to determine what they actually are.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.456
So this behavior is something
called sensor fusion

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.056
in computer science and robotics.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.296
And what that means
is taking multiple senses,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.256
so vision and smell,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.216
and combining them to get a more
accurate picture of what's around you.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.895
And to actually fly to these bananas --
to fly to these potential bananas --

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.135
what fruit flies do,

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.015
rather than swerving
or doing this really complicated thing,

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.216
at any given time they're either
moving forward or they're turning.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.736
So they alternate
between moving forward and turning.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.416
So they're able to combine
these really simple behaviors

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.056
to really effectively
and really efficiently find food.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.136
And bacteria actually
do something similar.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.816
Which is really cool
because bacteria are a single cell,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.496
they don't have a brain or nerves
or anything like that.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.736
So what bacteria do

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.176
is they do something
called the biased random walk.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.936
For example, if they're trying
to find the source of food,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.896
they play this game of "warmer, colder."

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.896
So as they're getting warmer,
as they're moving closer to the food,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.976
they keep moving in this random direction.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.456
Then whenever they get colder,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.816
so whenever they start
to move away from the food,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.016
they turn in a random
direction and try again.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.736
And so basically what they're doing

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.936
is using these same behaviors
of moving forward and turning,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.840
and they're able to really
effectively locate food.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.576
So to mimic these behaviors,
I created this flying sensor platform.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.416
There's an image there,
and you can see it physically here.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.816
It has a bunch of sensors.
It has two gas sensors,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.936
and they can sense
carbon dioxide and smoke,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.776
which are really good markers of fire.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.522
It also has two temperature sensors,

00:09:43.547 --> 00:09:44.736
and a camera.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.976
And what I'm doing here

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.576
is combining the information
from all of these sensors

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.936
to be able to locate fires.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.136
So again,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.216
this is the sensory fusion behavior
that we find in fruit flies.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.416
And then to actually fly this robot,
it mimics those two behaviors.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.696
So it first flies forward,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.856
and then at certain points
within its flight,

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.656
it turns to change direction.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.216
So all of this hardware
costs around 90 dollars,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.496
compared to tens of thousands
of dollars for previous work.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.176
So this is a really cheap platform

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.416
and it's really effective
for first responders.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.576
And so I actually
conducted some experiments

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.016
with some local firefighters.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.096
We set these small, controlled fires --
you can see one there --

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.576
and we had my robot find them.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.056
So I'll let this video play,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.696
and you'll see that it starts
really far from the fire.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.976
It can't actually see it,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.816
and so it uses all of these senses --

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.600
it uses gas and heat, and vision
to be able to locate it.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.416
And you'll see that it lands
right next to the fire.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.136
So one of the places
this can be applied is in schools --

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.400
(Applause)

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.216
So I was talking with these firefighters,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.176
and one the things they mentioned
is that if a fire is in a school,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.256
what they actually have to do
is go room by room

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.856
trying to find where the fire is,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.216
because they have no information
that could help them.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.676
So this is really inefficient,
it takes a long time,

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.605
and kids could be trapped in the school,

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.696
and they really have no way to get out.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.696
So one of the ways this could be applied

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.056
is going into that school
and really efficiently,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.496
within about a minute or two,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.976
finding where the fire is
using all of these senses,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.776
and looking at biology.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.256
What I'm working on now
is combining all of my work.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.216
So combining escaping,
and avoiding obstacles,

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.976
and navigation and finding things,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.296
to create this one low-cost platform

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.536
that firefighters and first responders
can use all across the world,

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.816
to save lives with drones.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.816
But none of this would have been possible

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.696
without the really effective
and really simple ways

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.056
in which nature has solved
all of these problems.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.056
So let me leave you with this.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.296
Look around.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.816
Think about how things work.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.016
And you'll find inspiration
in the most overlooked of places.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.256
Thank you.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.680
(Applause)
