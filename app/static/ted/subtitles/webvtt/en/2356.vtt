00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.920
I'd like to start by asking you all
to go to your happy place, please.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.640
Yes, your happy place,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.600
I know you've got one even if it's fake.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.840
(Laughter)

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.160
OK, so, comfortable?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.400
Good.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.393
Now I'd like to you to mentally answer
the following questions.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.480
Is there any strip lighting
in your happy place?

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.640
Any plastic tables?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.360
Polyester flooring?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.200
Mobile phones?

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.720
No?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.665
I think we all know that our happy place

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.480
is meant to be
somewhere natural, outdoors --

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.119
on a beach, fireside.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.680
We'll be reading or eating or knitting.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.640
And we're surrounded
by natural light and organic elements.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.280
Natural things make us happy.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.160
And happiness is a great motivator;
we strive for happiness.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.800
Perhaps that's why
we're always redesigning everything,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.520
in the hopes that our solutions
might feel more natural.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.320
So let's start there --

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.760
with the idea that good design
should feel natural.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.319
Your phone is not very natural.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.576
And you probably think
you're addicted to your phone,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.840
but you're really not.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.280
We're not addicted to devices,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.400
we're addicted to the information
that flows through them.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.640
I wonder how long you would be
happy in your happy place

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.800
without any information
from the outside world.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.806
I'm interested in how we access
that information,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.840
how we experience it.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.880
We're moving from a time
of static information,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.880
held in books and libraries and bus stops,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.160
through a period of digital information,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.440
towards a period of fluid information,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.680
where your children will expect to be able
to access anything, anywhere at any time,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.600
from quantum physics
to medieval viticulture,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.480
from gender theory to tomorrow's weather,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.840
just like switching on a lightbulb --

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.080
Imagine that.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.800
Humans also like simple tools.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.440
Your phone is not a very simple tool.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.120
A fork is a simple tool.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.360
(Laughter)

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.199
And we don't like them made of plastic,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.907
in the same way I don't really like
my phone very much --

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:14.531
it's not how I want
to experience information.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.560
I think there are better solutions
than a world mediated by screens.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.000
I don't hate screens, but I don't feel --

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.040
and I don't think any of us feel that good

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.720
about how much time
we spend slouched over them.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.400
Fortunately,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.202
the big tech companies seem to agree.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.960
They're actually heavily invested
in touch and speech and gesture,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.760
and also in senses --

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.520
things that can turn
dumb objects, like cups,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.360
and imbue them with the magic
of the Internet,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.760
potentially turning this digital cloud

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.360
into something we might touch and move.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.480
The parents in crisis over screen time

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.640
need physical digital toys
teaching their kids to read,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.440
as well as family-safe app stores.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.680
And I think, actually,
that's already really happening.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.760
Reality is richer than screens.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.560
For example, I love books.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.440
For me they are time machines --
atoms and molecules bound in space,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.440
from the moment of their creation
to the moment of my experience.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.000
But frankly,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.400
the content's identical on my phone.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.760
So what makes this
a richer experience than a screen?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.400
I mean, scientifically.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.280
We need screens, of course.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.640
I'm going to show film,
I need the enormous screen.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.400
But there's more than you can do
with these magic boxes.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.640
Your phone is not
the Internet's door bitch.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.880
(Laughter)

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.760
We can build things --
physical things,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.280
using physics and pixels,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.987
that can integrate the Internet
into the world around us.

00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:59.531
And I'm going to show you
a few examples of those.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.400
A while ago, I got to work
with a design agency, Berg,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.240
on an exploration of what the Internet
without screens might actually look like.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.320
And they showed us a range ways

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.279
that light can work with simple senses
and physical objects

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.600
to really bring the Internet to life,
to make it tangible.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.960
Like this wonderfully mechanical
YouTube player.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.960
And this was an inspiration to me.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.520
Next I worked with
the Japanese agency, AQ,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.880
on a research project into mental health.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.301
We wanted to create an object

00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:41.040
that could capture the subjective data
around mood swings

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.480
that's so essential to diagnosis.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.120
This object captures your touch,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.000
so you might press it
very hard if you're angry,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.160
or stroke it if you're calm.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.800
It's like a digital emoji stick.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.000
And then you might revisit
those moments later,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.760
and add context to them online.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.640
Most of all,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.160
we wanted to create
an intimate, beautiful thing

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.120
that could live in your pocket

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.360
and be loved.

00:05:08.753 --> 00:05:10.896
The binoculars are actually
a birthday present

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.063
for the Sydney Opera House's
40th anniversary.

00:05:13.087 --> 00:05:17.040
Our friends at Tellart in Boston
brought over a pair of street binoculars,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.557
the kind you might find
on the Empire State Building,

00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:22.400
and they fitted them with 360-degree views

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.040
of other iconic world heritage sights --

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.760
(Laughter)

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.800
using Street View.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.880
And then we stuck them under the steps.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.600
So, they became this very physical,
simple reappropriation,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.680
or like a portal to these other icons.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.640
So you might see Versailles
or Shackleton's Hut.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.720
Basically, it's virtual
reality circa 1955.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.800
(Laughter)

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.880
In our office we use
hacky sacks to exchange URLs.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.680
This is incredibly simple,
it's like your Opal card.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.480
You basically put a website
on the little chip in here,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.040
and then you do this and ... bosh! --

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.400
the website appears on your phone.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.920
It's about 10 cents.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.056
Treehugger is a project
that we're working on

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.480
with Grumpy Sailor and Finch,
here in Sydney.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.400
And I'm very excited
about what might happen

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.240
when you pull the phones apart
and you put the bits into trees,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.160
and that my children
might have an opportunity

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.800
to visit an enchanted forest
guided by a magic wand,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.840
where they could talk to digital fairies
and ask them questions,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.080
and be asked questions in return.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.320
As you can see,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.360
we're at the cardboard stage
with this one.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.560
(Laughter)

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.800
But I'm very excited

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.720
by the possibility of getting kids
back outside without screens,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.680
but with all the powerful magic
of the Internet at their fingertips.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.840
And we hope to have something like this
working by the end of the year.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.280
So let's recap.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.840
Humans like natural solutions.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.920
Humans love information.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.240
Humans need simple tools.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.600
These principles should underpin
how we design for the future,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.520
not just for the Internet.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.680
You may feel uncomfortable about the age
of information that we're moving into.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.160
You may feel challenged,
rather than simply excited.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.200
Guess what? Me too.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.080
It's a really extraordinary period
of human history.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.680
We are the people
that actually build our world,

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.966
there are no artificial intelligences...

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.415
yet.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.320
(Laughter)

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.760
It's us -- designers, architects,
artists, engineers.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.280
And if we challenge ourselves,

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.240
I think that actually
we can have a happy place

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.760
filled with the information we love

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.600
that feels as natural and as simple
as switching on lightbulb.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.355
And although it may seem inevitable,

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:59.720
that what the public wants
is watches and websites and widgets,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.920
maybe we could give a bit of thought
to cork and light and hacky sacks.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.280
Thank you very much.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.720
(Applause)
