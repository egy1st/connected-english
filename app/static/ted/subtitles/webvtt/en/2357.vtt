00:00:03.317 --> 00:00:07.000
Interpreter: Piano, "p,"
is my favorite musical symbol.

00:00:07.504 --> 00:00:09.293
It means to play softly.

00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:14.170
If you're playing a musical instrument
and you notice a "p" in the score,

00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:15.817
you need to play softer.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.480
Two p's -- even softer.

00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:21.959
Four p's -- extremely soft.

00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:29.756
This is my drawing of a p-tree,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.090
which demonstrates

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:35.603
no matter how many thousands
upon thousands of p's there may be,

00:00:35.627 --> 00:00:37.560
you'll never reach complete silence.

00:00:38.477 --> 00:00:41.255
That's my current definition of silence:

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:43.128
a very obscure sound.

00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:46.459
I'd like to share a little bit

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:49.649
about the history
of American Sign Language, ASL,

00:00:49.673 --> 00:00:51.361
plus a bit of my own background.

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:59.067
French sign language was brought
to America during the early 1800s,

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:03.166
and as time went by,
mixed with local signs,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.519
it evolved into the language
we know today as ASL.

00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:09.765
So it has a history of about 200 years.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.508
I was born deaf,

00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:18.779
and I was taught to believe
that sound wasn't a part of my life.

00:01:20.662 --> 00:01:22.497
And I believed it to be true.

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:28.841
Yet, I realize now
that that wasn't the case at all.

00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:32.057
Sound was very much a part of my life,

00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:33.957
really, on my mind every day.

00:01:38.483 --> 00:01:42.470
As a Deaf person living
in a world of sound,

00:01:42.494 --> 00:01:45.414
it's as if I was living
in a foreign country,

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:49.680
blindly following its rules,
customs, behaviors and norms

00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:51.315
without ever questioning them.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.930
So how is it that I understand sound?

00:02:06.282 --> 00:02:09.226
Well, I watch how people
behave and respond to sound.

00:02:10.654 --> 00:02:14.276
You people are like my loudspeakers,
and amplify sound.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.421
I learn and mirror that behavior.

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:19.733
At the same time,
I've learned that I create sound,

00:02:19.757 --> 00:02:21.914
and I've seen how people respond to me.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.456
Thus I've learned, for example ...

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.119
"Don't slam the door!"

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.747
"Don't make too much noise when
you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"

00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:32.771
(Laughter)

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:34.063
"Don't burp,

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:35.268
and when you're eating,

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:38.134
make sure you don't scrape
your utensils on the plate."

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.688
All of these things
I term "sound etiquette."

00:02:43.927 --> 00:02:46.358
Maybe I think about sound etiquette

00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:48.596
more than the average hearing person does.

00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:51.919
I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.

00:02:55.463 --> 00:02:59.329
And I'm always waiting
in eager nervous anticipation

00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:01.435
around sound, about what's to come next.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.743
Hence, this drawing.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.894
TBD, to be decided.

00:03:07.724 --> 00:03:10.264
TBC, to be continued.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.616
TBA, to be announced.

00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:18.659
And you notice the staff --

00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:20.874
there are no notes contained in the lines.

00:03:20.898 --> 00:03:24.546
That's because the lines
already contain sound

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.901
through the subtle smudges and smears.

00:03:28.863 --> 00:03:32.242
In Deaf culture,
movement is equivalent to sound.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.301
This is a sign for "staff" in ASL.

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:42.817
A typical staff contains five lines.

00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:46.678
Yet for me, signing it
with my thumb sticking up like that

00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:48.029
doesn't feel natural.

00:03:48.053 --> 00:03:51.461
That's why you'll notice in my drawings,
I stick to four lines on paper.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:57.188
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity
to travel to Berlin, Germany,

00:03:57.212 --> 00:03:58.981
for an artist residency there.

00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.819
Prior to this time,
I had been working as a painter.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.075
During this summer, I visited
different museums and gallery spaces,

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.081
and as I went from one place to the next,

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:13.424
I noticed there was no visual art there.

00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:19.885
At that time, sound was trending,
and this struck me ...

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.887
there was no visual art,

00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:23.418
everything was auditory.

00:04:25.482 --> 00:04:28.122
Now sound has come into my art territory.

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.816
Is it going to further
distance me from art?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.496
I realized that doesn't
have to be the case at all.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.671
I actually know sound.

00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:40.337
I know it so well

00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.699
that it doesn't have to be something
just experienced through the ears.

00:04:43.723 --> 00:04:46.708
It could be felt tactually,

00:04:46.732 --> 00:04:48.615
or experienced as a visual,

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.313
or even as an idea.

00:04:53.048 --> 00:04:56.309
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound

00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:58.447
and to put it into my art practice.

00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:04.595
And everything that I had been
taught regarding sound,

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:07.353
I decided to do away with and unlearn.

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.389
I started creating a new body of work.

00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:15.515
And when I presented this
to the art community,

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.435
I was blown away with the amount
of support and attention I received.

00:05:20.676 --> 00:05:22.042
I realized:

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.155
sound is like money,

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:30.351
power, control --

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:31.919
social currency.

00:05:35.782 --> 00:05:39.646
In the back of my mind, I've always felt
that sound was your thing,

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.157
a hearing person's thing.

00:05:44.014 --> 00:05:46.489
And sound is so powerful

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:50.269
that it could either
disempower me and my artwork,

00:05:50.293 --> 00:05:52.301
or it could empower me.

00:05:53.138 --> 00:05:54.675
I chose to be empowered.

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.317
There's a massive culture
around spoken language.

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:06.500
And just because I don't use
my literal voice to communicate,

00:06:06.524 --> 00:06:10.276
in society's eyes
it's as if I don't have a voice at all.

00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:16.863
So I need to work with individuals
who can support me as an equal

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.359
and become my voice.

00:06:20.523 --> 00:06:24.765
And that way, I'm able to maintain
relevancy in society today.

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.211
So at school, at work and institutions,

00:06:27.235 --> 00:06:29.559
I work with many
different ASL interpreters.

00:06:31.254 --> 00:06:34.453
And their voice becomes
my voice and identity.

00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:38.070
They help me to be heard.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.543
And their voices hold value and currency.

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:54.516
Ironically, by borrowing out their voices,

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.361
I'm able to maintain
a temporary form of currency,

00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:01.367
kind of like taking out a loan
with a very high interest rate.

00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:08.149
If I didn't continue this practice,

00:07:08.173 --> 00:07:11.006
I feel that I could just
fade off into oblivion

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.397
and not maintain
any form of social currency.

00:07:17.488 --> 00:07:20.143
So with sound as my new art medium,

00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:21.901
I delved into the world of music.

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:27.065
And I was surprised to see
the similarities between music and ASL.

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:30.703
For example,

00:07:30.727 --> 00:07:33.079
a musical note

00:07:33.103 --> 00:07:36.126
cannot be fully captured
and expressed on paper.

00:07:36.783 --> 00:07:39.835
And the same holds true
for a concept in ASL.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.624
They're both highly spatial
and highly inflected --

00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:52.370
meaning that subtle changes

00:07:52.394 --> 00:07:54.903
can affect the entire meaning

00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:56.711
of both signs and sounds.

00:07:59.898 --> 00:08:02.120
I'd like to share with you
a piano metaphor,

00:08:02.144 --> 00:08:05.129
to have you have a better
understanding of how ASL works.

00:08:05.153 --> 00:08:06.711
So, envision a piano.

00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:11.654
ASL is broken down into
many different grammatical parameters.

00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:16.831
If you assign a different parameter
to each finger as you play the piano --

00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:21.860
such as facial expression, body movement,

00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:25.656
speed, hand shape and so on,

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.888
as you play the piano --

00:08:27.912 --> 00:08:29.749
English is a linear language,

00:08:29.773 --> 00:08:32.578
as if one key is being pressed at a time.

00:08:32.602 --> 00:08:36.250
However, ASL is more like a chord --

00:08:36.274 --> 00:08:39.658
all 10 fingers need
to come down simultaneously

00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:43.304
to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.

00:08:45.548 --> 00:08:49.574
If just one of those keys
were to change the chord,

00:08:49.598 --> 00:08:51.791
it would create a completely
different meaning.

00:08:52.152 --> 00:08:56.426
The same applies to music
in regards to pitch, tone and volume.

00:09:00.518 --> 00:09:04.096
In ASL, by playing around with these
different grammatical parameters,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.813
you can express different ideas.

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.822
For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.948
This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:13.950
I'm looking at you.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.356
Staring at you.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.094
(Laughter)

00:09:21.103 --> 00:09:22.400
(Laughter)

00:09:23.733 --> 00:09:26.399
Oh -- busted.

00:09:26.423 --> 00:09:27.573
(Laughter)

00:09:29.608 --> 00:09:30.779
Uh-oh.

00:09:33.521 --> 00:09:34.935
What are you looking at?

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.738
Aw, stop.

00:09:38.762 --> 00:09:40.431
(Laughter)

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:41.639
I then started thinking,

00:09:41.663 --> 00:09:44.580
"What if I was to look at ASL
through a musical lens?"

00:09:45.011 --> 00:09:48.218
If I was to create a sign
and repeat it over and over,

00:09:48.242 --> 00:09:50.631
it could become
like a piece of visual music.

00:09:52.016 --> 00:09:55.652
For example, this is the sign for "day,"

00:09:55.676 --> 00:09:57.848
as the sun rises and sets.

00:09:59.789 --> 00:10:02.129
This is "all day."

00:10:04.416 --> 00:10:07.617
If I was to repeat it and slow it down,

00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:09.806
visually it looks like a piece of music.

00:10:12.023 --> 00:10:14.482
All ... day.

00:10:15.186 --> 00:10:19.084
I feel the same holds true
for "all night."

00:10:21.776 --> 00:10:22.930
"All night."

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.125
This is ALL-NIGHT,
represented in this drawing.

00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:33.714
And this led me to thinking
about three different kinds of nights:

00:10:37.827 --> 00:10:38.977
"last night,"

00:10:40.747 --> 00:10:41.899
"overnight,"

00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:48.303
(Sings) "all night long."

00:10:48.327 --> 00:10:50.588
(Laughter)

00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:59.206
I feel like the third one has
a lot more musicality than the other two.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.381
(Laughter)

00:11:01.413 --> 00:11:04.448
This represents how time
is expressed in ASL

00:11:04.472 --> 00:11:08.931
and how the distance from your body
can express the changes in time.

00:11:08.955 --> 00:11:10.594
For example,

00:11:10.618 --> 00:11:13.757
1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,

00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:17.011
present tense happens closest
and in front of the body,

00:11:17.035 --> 00:11:20.472
future is in front of the body
and the past is to your back.

00:11:24.209 --> 00:11:27.040
So, the first example
is "a long time ago."

00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:29.370
Then "past,"

00:11:32.538 --> 00:11:34.231
"used to"

00:11:34.255 --> 00:11:36.290
and the last one, which is my favorite,

00:11:36.314 --> 00:11:38.940
with the very romantic
and dramatic notion to it,

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:40.553
"once upon a time."

00:11:40.577 --> 00:11:41.986
(Laughter)

00:11:45.962 --> 00:11:48.679
"Common time"

00:11:48.703 --> 00:11:50.471
is a musical term

00:11:50.495 --> 00:11:54.478
with a specific time signature
of four beats per measure.

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:57.426
Yet when I see the word "common time,"

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.606
what automatically comes to mind for me
is "at the same time."

00:12:01.645 --> 00:12:04.856
So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.

00:12:05.578 --> 00:12:08.197
We have the staff
across the head and the chest.

00:12:08.221 --> 00:12:09.403
[Head: RH, Flash claw]

00:12:09.427 --> 00:12:10.677
[Common time]

00:12:10.701 --> 00:12:12.234
[Chest: LH, Flash claw]

00:12:13.712 --> 00:12:16.810
I'm now going to demonstrate
a hand shape called the "flash claw."

00:12:18.722 --> 00:12:20.699
Can you please follow along with me?

00:12:21.723 --> 00:12:23.067
Everybody, hands up.

00:12:26.776 --> 00:12:29.474
Now we're going to do it
in both the head and the chest,

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:31.872
kind of like "common time"
or at the same time.

00:12:35.595 --> 00:12:36.896
Yes, got it.

00:12:37.329 --> 00:12:40.144
That means "to fall in love"
in International [Sign].

00:12:40.168 --> 00:12:42.045
(Laughter)

00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:43.972
International [Sign], as a note,

00:12:43.996 --> 00:12:46.741
is a visual tool to help communicate

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:49.466
across cultures and sign languages
around the world.

00:12:49.997 --> 00:12:52.283
The second one I'd like
to demonstrate is this --

00:12:52.307 --> 00:12:54.043
please follow along with me again.

00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:00.041
And now this.

00:13:05.358 --> 00:13:08.058
This is "colonization" in ASL.

00:13:08.082 --> 00:13:09.486
(Laughter)

00:13:11.407 --> 00:13:12.678
Now the third --

00:13:12.702 --> 00:13:14.096
please follow along again.

00:13:19.072 --> 00:13:20.222
And again.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.478
This is "enlightenment" in ASL.

00:13:27.502 --> 00:13:29.063
So let's do all three together.

00:13:31.732 --> 00:13:32.889
"Fall in love,"

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:35.066
"colonization"

00:13:35.845 --> 00:13:36.995
and "enlightenment."

00:13:38.767 --> 00:13:39.917
Good job, everyone.

00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:41.159
(Laughter)

00:13:41.183 --> 00:13:43.421
Notice how all three signs
are very similar,

00:13:43.445 --> 00:13:45.542
they all happen at the head and the chest,

00:13:45.566 --> 00:13:47.788
but they convey quite different meanings.

00:13:47.812 --> 00:13:51.136
So it's amazing to see
how ASL is alive and thriving,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.459
just like music is.

00:13:54.152 --> 00:13:56.978
However, in this day and age,

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:59.604
we live in a very audio-centric world.

00:13:59.628 --> 00:14:03.009
And just because ASL has no sound to it,

00:14:03.033 --> 00:14:05.943
it automatically holds no social currency.

00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:12.009
We need to start thinking harder
about what defines social currency

00:14:12.033 --> 00:14:15.875
and allow ASL to develop
its own form of currency --

00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:17.064
without sound.

00:14:18.262 --> 00:14:22.950
And this could possibly be a step
to lead to a more inclusive society.

00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:28.423
And maybe people will understand

00:14:28.447 --> 00:14:31.983
that you don't need
to be deaf to learn ASL,

00:14:32.007 --> 00:14:34.294
nor do you have to be hearing
to learn music.

00:14:36.891 --> 00:14:39.586
ASL is such a rich treasure

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.395
that I'd like you
to have the same experience.

00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:45.195
And I'd like to invite you
to open your ears,

00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:47.110
to open your eyes,

00:14:47.134 --> 00:14:48.845
take part in our culture

00:14:48.869 --> 00:14:51.388
and experience our visual language.

00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:52.847
And you never know,

00:14:52.871 --> 00:14:54.611
you might just fall in love with us.

00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:56.693
(Applause)

00:14:56.717 --> 00:14:57.879
Thank you.

00:14:58.508 --> 00:15:00.409
Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:03.831
(Applause)
