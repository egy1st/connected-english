00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:07.521
Every day, I listen to harrowing stories
of people fleeing for their lives,

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:11.458
across dangerous borders
and unfriendly seas.

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:16.604
But there's one story
that keeps me awake at night,

00:00:16.628 --> 00:00:18.184
and it's about Doaa.

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:21.031
A Syrian refugee, 19 years old,

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:26.891
she was living a grinding existence
in Egypt working day wages.

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:32.302
Her dad was constantly thinking
of his thriving business back in Syria

00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:35.674
that had been blown to pieces by a bomb.

00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:42.294
And the war that drove them there
was still raging in its fourth year.

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:46.208
And the community
that once welcomed them there

00:00:46.232 --> 00:00:48.597
had become weary of them.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:52.306
And one day, men on motorcycles
tried to kidnap her.

00:00:53.084 --> 00:00:57.833
Once an aspiring student
thinking only of her future,

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:01.435
now she was scared all the time.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.278
But she was also full of hope,

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:09.325
because she was in love
with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem.

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:14.359
Bassem was also struggling in Egypt,
and he said to Doaa,

00:01:14.383 --> 00:01:17.749
"Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety.

00:01:17.773 --> 00:01:21.916
I will work, you can study --
the promise of a new life."

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.057
And he asked her father
for her hand in marriage.

00:01:26.724 --> 00:01:32.240
But they knew to get to Europe
they had to risk their lives,

00:01:32.264 --> 00:01:34.764
traveling across the Mediterranean Sea,

00:01:34.788 --> 00:01:40.245
putting their hands in smugglers',
notorious for their cruelty.

00:01:41.173 --> 00:01:44.562
And Doaa was terrified of the water.

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:48.342
She always had been.
She never learned to swim.

00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:54.975
It was August that year,
and already 2,000 people had died

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:56.953
trying to cross the Mediterranean,

00:01:56.977 --> 00:02:00.947
but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it
all the way to Northern Europe,

00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:03.240
and she thought, "Maybe we can, too."

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:07.001
So she asked her parents if they could go,

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:10.367
and after a painful discussion,
they consented,

00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:16.521
and Bassem paid his entire life savings --
2,500 dollars each --

00:02:16.545 --> 00:02:17.941
to the smugglers.

00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:22.036
It was a Saturday morning
when the call came,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.539
and they were taken by bus to a beach,
hundreds of people on the beach.

00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:30.921
They were taken then by small boats
onto an old fishing boat,

00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:33.503
500 of them crammed onto that boat,

00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:36.403
300 below, [200] above.

00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:42.004
There were Syrians, Palestinians,
Africans, Muslims and Christians,

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:47.356
100 children, including Sandra --
little Sandra, six years old --

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.196
and Masa, 18 months.

00:02:51.498 --> 00:02:55.396
There were families on that boat,
crammed together shoulder to shoulder,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.952
feet to feet.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:03:00.784
Doaa was sitting with her legs
crammed up to her chest,

00:03:00.808 --> 00:03:03.323
Bassem holding her hand.

00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:07.093
Day two on the water,
they were sick with worry

00:03:07.117 --> 00:03:10.196
and sick to their stomachs
from the rough sea.

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.084
Day three, Doaa had a premonition.

00:03:15.068 --> 00:03:19.621
And she said to Bassem,
"I fear we're not going to make it.

00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:21.684
I fear the boat is going to sink."

00:03:22.517 --> 00:03:25.666
And Bassem said to her,
"Please be patient.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.872
We will make it to Sweden,
we will get married

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:30.450
and we will have a future."

00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.604
Day four, the passengers
were getting agitated.

00:03:35.628 --> 00:03:38.764
They asked the captain,
"When will we get there?"

00:03:38.788 --> 00:03:42.176
He told them to shut up,
and he insulted them.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.482
He said, "In 16 hours we will reach
the shores of Italy."

00:03:46.506 --> 00:03:49.680
They were weak and weary.

00:03:49.704 --> 00:03:53.975
Soon they saw a boat approach --
a smaller boat, 10 men on board,

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.414
who started shouting at them,
hurling insults,

00:03:57.438 --> 00:04:01.788
throwing sticks, asking them
to all disembark

00:04:01.812 --> 00:04:05.527
and get on this smaller,
more unseaworthy boat.

00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:09.069
The parents were terrified
for their children,

00:04:09.093 --> 00:04:13.094
and they collectively
refused to disembark.

00:04:14.157 --> 00:04:17.273
So the boat sped away in anger,

00:04:17.297 --> 00:04:21.527
and a half an hour later, came back

00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:27.603
and started deliberately ramming a hole
in the side of Doaa's boat,

00:04:27.627 --> 00:04:30.240
just below where she
and Bassem were sitting.

00:04:31.764 --> 00:04:35.103
And she heard how they yelled,

00:04:35.127 --> 00:04:38.488
"Let the fish eat your flesh!"

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:45.437
And they started laughing
as the boat capsized and sank.

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.058
The 300 people below deck were doomed.

00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:54.346
Doaa was holding on to the side
of the boat as it sank,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.188
and watched in horror as a small child
was cut to pieces by the propeller.

00:05:02.355 --> 00:05:04.554
Bassem said to her, "Please let go,

00:05:04.578 --> 00:05:07.743
or you'll be swept in and the propeller
will kill you, too."

00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:10.315
And remember -- she can't swim.

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:15.187
But she let go and she started moving
her arms and her legs,

00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:16.647
thinking, "This is swimming."

00:05:16.671 --> 00:05:21.044
And miraculously,
Bassem found a life ring.

00:05:21.806 --> 00:05:23.854
It was one of those child's rings

00:05:23.878 --> 00:05:27.975
that they use to play
in swimming pools and on calm seas.

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.044
And Doaa climbed onto the ring,

00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:33.788
her arms and her legs
dangling by the side.

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.776
Bassem was a good swimmer,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.594
so he held her hand and tread water.

00:05:42.064 --> 00:05:44.002
Around them there were corpses.

00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:46.494
Around 100 people survived initially,

00:05:46.518 --> 00:05:51.059
and they started coming together
in groups, praying for rescue.

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:55.400
But when a day went by and no one came,

00:05:55.424 --> 00:05:57.249
some people gave up hope,

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.447
and Doaa and Bassem watched

00:05:59.471 --> 00:06:06.052
as men in the distance took their
life vests off and sank into the water.

00:06:07.052 --> 00:06:12.975
One man approached them
with a small baby perched on his shoulder,

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:14.649
nine months old -- Malek.

00:06:14.673 --> 00:06:19.752
He was holding onto a gas canister
to stay afloat, and he said to them,

00:06:19.776 --> 00:06:21.726
"I fear I am not going to survive.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.416
I'm too weak. I don't have
the courage anymore."

00:06:24.829 --> 00:06:29.975
And he handed little Malek
over to Bassem and to Doaa,

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:32.711
and they perched her onto the life ring.

00:06:33.774 --> 00:06:39.188
So now they were three,
Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.

00:06:39.212 --> 00:06:42.341
And let me take a pause
in this story right here

00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:44.663
and ask the question:

00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:49.480
why do refugees like Doaa
take these kinds of risks?

00:06:51.061 --> 00:06:55.904
Millions of refugees are living
in exile, in limbo.

00:06:57.232 --> 00:07:01.532
They're living in countries [fleeing]
from a war that has been raging

00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:03.840
for four years.

00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:08.795
Even if they wanted to return, they can't.

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.581
Their homes, their businesses,

00:07:11.605 --> 00:07:15.127
their towns and their cities
have been completely destroyed.

00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:17.975
This is a UNESCO World Heritage City,

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:19.756
Homs, in Syria.

00:07:21.097 --> 00:07:25.662
So people continue to flee
into neighboring countries,

00:07:25.686 --> 00:07:29.285
and we build refugee camps
for them in the desert.

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:33.319
Hundreds of thousands of people
live in camps like these,

00:07:33.343 --> 00:07:38.316
and thousands and thousands more,
millions, live in towns and cities.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.558
And the communities,

00:07:39.582 --> 00:07:42.438
the neighboring countries
that once welcomed them

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.224
with open arms and hearts

00:07:44.248 --> 00:07:45.866
are overwhelmed.

00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:51.183
There are simply not enough schools,
water systems, sanitation.

00:07:51.747 --> 00:07:56.370
Even rich European countries
could never handle such an influx

00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:59.637
without massive investment.

00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:06.433
The Syria war has driven almost
four million people over the borders,

00:08:06.457 --> 00:08:11.394
but over seven million people
are on the run inside the country.

00:08:11.418 --> 00:08:15.109
That means that over half
the Syrian population

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:17.393
has been forced to flee.

00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:22.059
Back to those neighboring
countries hosting so many.

00:08:23.114 --> 00:08:28.147
They feel that the richer world
has done too little to support them.

00:08:29.401 --> 00:08:33.798
And days have turned into months,
months into years.

00:08:34.483 --> 00:08:38.055
A refugee's stay is supposed
to be temporary.

00:08:38.079 --> 00:08:41.400
Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water.

00:08:41.424 --> 00:08:45.773
It was their second day,
and Bassem was getting very weak.

00:08:46.764 --> 00:08:50.765
And now it was Doaa's turn
to say to Bassem,

00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:56.472
"My love, please hold on to hope,
to our future. We will make it."

00:08:57.376 --> 00:09:00.057
And he said to her,

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:04.518
"I'm sorry, my love,
that I put you in this situation.

00:09:04.542 --> 00:09:09.219
I have never loved anyone
as much as I love you."

00:09:10.871 --> 00:09:14.269
And he released himself into the water,

00:09:14.293 --> 00:09:20.549
and Doaa watched as the love of her life
drowned before her eyes.

00:09:23.888 --> 00:09:26.304
Later that day,

00:09:26.328 --> 00:09:31.979
a mother came up to Doaa with her
small 18-month-old daughter, Masa.

00:09:32.741 --> 00:09:35.666
This was the little girl I showed you
in the picture earlier,

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.538
with the life vests.

00:09:37.562 --> 00:09:39.755
Her older sister Sandra had just drowned,

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:43.898
and her mother knew she had to do
everything in her power

00:09:43.922 --> 00:09:45.414
to save her daughter.

00:09:45.993 --> 00:09:49.850
And she said to Doaa,
"Please take this child.

00:09:49.874 --> 00:09:53.902
Let her be part of you.
I will not survive."

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:58.467
And then she went away and drowned.

00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:04.059
So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee
who was terrified of the water,

00:10:04.083 --> 00:10:05.975
who couldn't swim,

00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:11.591
found herself in charge
of two little baby kids.

00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:15.296
And they were thirsty and they were hungry
and they were agitated,

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.018
and she tried her best to amuse them,

00:10:18.042 --> 00:10:22.075
to sing to them, to say words
to them from the Quran.

00:10:23.234 --> 00:10:27.668
Around them, the bodies were bloating
and turning black.

00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:29.438
The sun was blazing during the day.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.182
At night, there was a cold moon and fog.

00:10:32.206 --> 00:10:34.182
It was very frightening.

00:10:34.976 --> 00:10:39.715
On the fourth day in the water,
this is how Doaa probably looked

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:41.860
on the ring with her two children.

00:10:41.884 --> 00:10:45.431
A woman came on the fourth day
and approached her

00:10:45.455 --> 00:10:48.566
and asked her to take another child --

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.605
a little boy, just four years old.

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:57.016
When Doaa took the little boy
and the mother drowned,

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.000
she said to the sobbing child,

00:10:59.024 --> 00:11:02.460
"She just went away
to find you water and food."

00:11:04.388 --> 00:11:06.381
But his heart soon stopped,

00:11:06.405 --> 00:11:10.078
and Doaa had to release
the little boy into the water.

00:11:11.023 --> 00:11:13.048
Later that day,

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:16.351
she looked up into the sky with hope,

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:20.390
because she saw two planes
crossing in the sky.

00:11:20.414 --> 00:11:24.913
And she waved her arms,
hoping they would see her,

00:11:24.937 --> 00:11:26.793
but the planes were soon gone.

00:11:27.317 --> 00:11:30.220
But that afternoon,
as the sun was going down,

00:11:30.244 --> 00:11:33.100
she saw a boat, a merchant vessel.

00:11:34.109 --> 00:11:38.126
And she said, "Please, God,
let them rescue me."

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.110
She waved her arms and she felt
like she shouted for about two hours.

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:46.744
And it had become dark,
but finally the searchlights found her

00:11:46.768 --> 00:11:48.975
and they extended a rope,

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:53.968
astonished to see a woman
clutching onto two babies.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.258
They pulled them onto the boat,
they got oxygen and blankets,

00:11:58.282 --> 00:12:01.289
and a Greek helicopter came
to pick them up

00:12:01.313 --> 00:12:03.425
and take them to the island of Crete.

00:12:04.353 --> 00:12:07.860
But Doaa looked down and asked,
"What of Malek?"

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.975
And they told her the little baby
did not survive --

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:15.386
she drew her last breath
in the boat's clinic.

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:21.975
But Doaa was sure that as they had
been pulled up onto the rescue boat,

00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:25.246
that little baby girl had been smiling.

00:12:27.278 --> 00:12:33.280
Only 11 people survived
that wreck, of the 500.

00:12:34.304 --> 00:12:38.975
There was never an international
investigation into what happened.

00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:43.094
There were some media reports
about mass murder at sea,

00:12:43.118 --> 00:12:44.443
a terrible tragedy,

00:12:44.467 --> 00:12:46.934
but that was only for one day.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.314
And then the news cycle moved on.

00:12:52.536 --> 00:12:57.078
Meanwhile, in a pediatric
hospital on Crete,

00:12:57.102 --> 00:13:00.474
little Masa was on the edge of death.

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:05.391
She was really dehydrated.
Her kidneys were failing.

00:13:05.415 --> 00:13:07.439
Her glucose levels were dangerously low.

00:13:07.463 --> 00:13:11.029
The doctors did everything
in their medical power to save them,

00:13:11.053 --> 00:13:14.713
and the Greek nurses never left her side,

00:13:14.737 --> 00:13:16.864
holding her, hugging her,
singing her words.

00:13:16.888 --> 00:13:22.457
My colleagues also visited
and said pretty words to her in Arabic.

00:13:22.481 --> 00:13:26.677
Amazingly, little Masa survived.

00:13:28.192 --> 00:13:34.128
And soon the Greek press started reporting
about the miracle baby,

00:13:34.152 --> 00:13:39.819
who had survived four days in the water
without food or anything to drink,

00:13:39.843 --> 00:13:44.577
and offers to adopt her came
from all over the country.

00:13:45.466 --> 00:13:48.856
And meanwhile, Doaa
was in another hospital on Crete,

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.492
thin, dehydrated.

00:13:51.571 --> 00:13:57.116
An Egyptian family took her into their
home as soon as she was released.

00:13:58.248 --> 00:14:02.995
And soon word went around
about Doaa's survival,

00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:06.197
and a phone number
was published on Facebook.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.865
Messages started coming in.

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:15.787
"Doaa, do you know
what happened to my brother?

00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:22.352
My sister? My parents? My friends?
Do you know if they survived?"

00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:26.975
One of those messages said,

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:31.447
"I believe you saved
my little niece, Masa."

00:14:32.249 --> 00:14:34.741
And it had this photo.

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:38.003
This was from Masa's uncle,

00:14:38.027 --> 00:14:42.749
a Syrian refugee who had made it
to Sweden with his family

00:14:42.773 --> 00:14:44.980
and also Masa's older sister.

00:14:45.647 --> 00:14:51.331
Soon, we hope, Masa will be reunited
with him in Sweden,

00:14:51.355 --> 00:14:56.879
and until then, she's being cared for
in a beautiful orphanage in Athens.

00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:04.003
And Doaa? Well, word went around
about her survival, too.

00:15:04.999 --> 00:15:08.712
And the media wrote
about this slight woman,

00:15:08.736 --> 00:15:12.648
and couldn't imagine how
she could survive all this time

00:15:12.672 --> 00:15:15.666
under such conditions in that sea,

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.721
and still save another life.

00:15:20.459 --> 00:15:25.846
The Academy of Athens, one of Greece's
most prestigious institutions,

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.226
gave her an award of bravery,

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.241
and she deserves all that praise,

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.686
and she deserves a second chance.

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:39.439
But she wants to still go to Sweden.

00:15:39.463 --> 00:15:41.693
She wants to reunite
with her family there.

00:15:41.717 --> 00:15:45.828
She wants to bring her mother
and her father and her younger siblings

00:15:45.852 --> 00:15:48.170
away from Egypt there as well,

00:15:48.194 --> 00:15:51.375
and I believe she will succeed.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:54.121
She wants to become a lawyer
or a politician

00:15:54.145 --> 00:15:59.039
or something that can help
fight injustice.

00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:02.127
She is an extraordinary survivor.

00:16:03.215 --> 00:16:05.779
But I have to ask:

00:16:05.803 --> 00:16:08.075
what if she didn't have to take that risk?

00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:10.575
Why did she have to go through all that?

00:16:11.226 --> 00:16:16.290
Why wasn't there a legal way
for her to study in Europe?

00:16:16.314 --> 00:16:20.610
Why couldn't Masa have taken
an airplane to Sweden?

00:16:20.634 --> 00:16:23.006
Why couldn't Bassem have found work?

00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:29.547
Why is there no massive resettlement
program for Syrian refugees,

00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:33.191
the victims of the worst war of our times?

00:16:33.778 --> 00:16:39.283
The world did this for the Vietnamese
in the 1970s. Why not now?

00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:45.241
Why is there so little investment
in the neighboring countries

00:16:45.265 --> 00:16:47.931
hosting so many refugees?

00:16:49.113 --> 00:16:51.975
And why, the root question,

00:16:51.999 --> 00:16:58.395
is so little being done to stop
the wars, the persecution

00:16:58.419 --> 00:17:02.975
and the poverty that is driving
so many people

00:17:02.999 --> 00:17:04.851
to the shores of Europe?

00:17:05.999 --> 00:17:08.608
Until these issues are resolved,

00:17:08.632 --> 00:17:11.967
people will continue to take to the seas

00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:15.420
and to seek safety and asylum.

00:17:16.103 --> 00:17:17.761
And what happens next?

00:17:18.253 --> 00:17:21.084
Well, that is largely Europe's choice.

00:17:21.108 --> 00:17:24.139
And I understand the public fears.

00:17:25.005 --> 00:17:30.932
People are worried about their security,
their economies, the changes of culture.

00:17:31.893 --> 00:17:36.034
But is that more important
than saving human lives?

00:17:36.859 --> 00:17:39.638
Because there is something
fundamental here

00:17:39.662 --> 00:17:42.466
that I think overrides the rest,

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:46.052
and it is about our common humanity.

00:17:46.719 --> 00:17:51.188
No person fleeing war or persecution

00:17:51.212 --> 00:17:56.373
should have to die
crossing a sea to reach safety.

00:17:56.397 --> 00:18:02.729
(Applause)

00:18:02.753 --> 00:18:03.920
One thing is for sure,

00:18:03.944 --> 00:18:07.127
that no refugee would be
on those dangerous boats

00:18:07.151 --> 00:18:09.499
if they could thrive where they are.

00:18:09.523 --> 00:18:12.801
And no migrant would take
that dangerous journey

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:16.711
if they had enough food
for themselves and their children.

00:18:16.735 --> 00:18:19.354
And no one would put their life savings

00:18:19.378 --> 00:18:22.171
in the hands of those notorious smugglers

00:18:22.195 --> 00:18:24.622
if there was a legal way to migrate.

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:29.066
So on behalf of little Masa

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.359
and on behalf of Doaa

00:18:31.383 --> 00:18:33.107
and of Bassem

00:18:33.131 --> 00:18:38.268
and of those 500 people
who drowned with them,

00:18:38.292 --> 00:18:41.435
can we make sure that they
did not die in vain?

00:18:42.308 --> 00:18:45.975
Could we be inspired by what happened,

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:51.950
and take a stand for a world
in which every life matters?

00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:54.310
Thank you.

00:18:54.334 --> 00:19:00.928
(Applause)
