WEBVTT

00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:02.587
I would like to invite you

00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:04.317
to come along on a visit

00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:05.730
to a dark continent.

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:08.013
It is the continent hidden

00:00:08.037 --> 00:00:10.089
under the surface of the earth.

00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:12.406
It is largely unexplored,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.113
poorly understood,
and the stuff of legends.

00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:17.975
But it is made also of dramatic landscapes

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:20.494
like this huge underground chamber,

00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:25.359
and it is rich with surprising
biological and mineralogical worlds.

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.975
Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers
in the last three centuries --

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.833
actually, we know also thanks
to satellite technology, of course --

00:00:34.857 --> 00:00:39.061
we know almost every single square meter
of our planet's surface.

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:44.026
However, we know still very little
about what is hidden inside the earth.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.975
Because a cave landscape,
like this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden,

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.353
the potential of cave exploration --
the geographical dimension --

00:00:53.377 --> 00:00:55.745
is poorly understood and unappreciated.

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.804
Because we are creatures
living on the surface,

00:00:58.828 --> 00:01:02.975
our perception of the inner
side of the planet

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:04.963
is in some ways skewed,

00:01:04.987 --> 00:01:07.439
as is that of the depth of the oceans

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:09.970
or of the upper atmosphere.

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:18.052
However, since systematic cave exploration
started about one century ago,

00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:22.447
we know actually that caves exist
in every continent of the world.

00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:26.515
A single cave system,
like Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky,

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.523
can be as long
as more than 600 kilometers.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.377
And an abyss like Krubera Voronya,
which is in the Caucasus region,

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:38.179
actually the deepest cave
explored in the world,

00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:42.524
can go as far as more than 2,000
meters below the surface.

00:01:42.548 --> 00:01:46.269
That means a journey of weeks
for a cave explorer.

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:50.771
Caves form in karstic regions.

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:53.975
So karstic regions are areas of the world

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.489
where the infiltrating water
along cracks, fractures,

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:01.473
can easily dissolve soluble lithologies,

00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:04.277
forming a drainage system
of tunnels, conduits --

00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:06.780
a three-dimensional network, actually.

00:02:06.804 --> 00:02:12.683
Karstic regions cover almost 20 percent
of the continents' surface,

00:02:12.707 --> 00:02:17.831
and we know actually that speleologists
in the last 50 years

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:23.519
have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers
of cave passages around the world,

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:24.911
which is a big number.

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:29.434
But geologists have estimated
that what is still missing,

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:31.688
to be discovered and mapped,

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:35.263
is something around 10 million kilometers.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:38.577
That means that for each meter
of a cave that we already know,

00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:40.134
that we have explored,

00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:45.552
there are still some tens of kilometers
of undiscovered passages.

00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:48.491
That means that this is really
an endless continent,

00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:52.013
and we will never be able
to explore it completely.

00:02:52.597 --> 00:02:56.093
And this estimation is made
without considering other types of caves,

00:02:56.117 --> 00:03:00.556
like, for example, inside glaciers
or even volcanic caves,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.112
which are not karstic,
but are formed by lava flows.

00:03:04.136 --> 00:03:09.792
And if we have a look at other planets
like, for example, Mars,

00:03:09.816 --> 00:03:11.666
you will see that this characteristic

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.777
is not so specific of our home planet.

00:03:15.623 --> 00:03:19.975
However, I will show to you now
that we do not need to go to Mars

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.204
to explore alien worlds.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.690
I'm a speleologist, that means
a cave explorer.

00:03:27.714 --> 00:03:31.622
And I started with this passion
when I was really young

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:35.707
in the mountains not far
from my hometown in North Italy,

00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:39.228
in the karstic regions of the Alps
and the Dolomites.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:43.093
But soon, the quest for exploration
brought me to the farthest corner

00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:45.846
of the planet, searching
for new potential entrances

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.773
of this undiscovered continent.

00:03:48.578 --> 00:03:53.639
And in 2009, I had the opportunity
to visit the tepui table mountains,

00:03:53.663 --> 00:03:56.659
which are in the Orinoco
and Amazon basins.

00:03:56.683 --> 00:04:01.235
These massifs enchanted me
from the first time I saw them.

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.626
They are surrounded by vertical,
vertiginous rock walls

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.121
with silvery waterfalls
that are lost in the forest.

00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:11.477
They really inspired in me
a sense of wilderness,

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.799
with a soul older than millions
and millions of years.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.391
And this dramatic landscape
inspired among other things

00:04:19.415 --> 00:04:23.975
also Conan Doyle's
"The Lost World" novel in 1912.

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:27.303
And they are, really, a lost world.

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:34.286
Scientists consider those mountains
as islands in time,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.948
being separated
from the surrounding lowlands

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:39.656
since tens of millions of years ago.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.581
They are surrounded
by up to 1,000-meter-high walls,

00:04:43.605 --> 00:04:46.737
resembling a fortress,
impregnable by humans.

00:04:46.761 --> 00:04:49.975
And, in fact, only a few
of these mountains have been climbed

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:51.835
and explored on their top.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.609
These mountains contain also
a scientific paradox:

00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:57.693
They are made by quartz,

00:04:57.717 --> 00:05:00.884
which is a very common mineral
on the earth's crust,

00:05:00.908 --> 00:05:05.286
and the rock made up by quartz
is called quartzite,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.618
and quartzite is one of the hardest
and least soluble minerals on earth.

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:14.033
So we do not expect at all
to find a cave there.

00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:18.975
Despite this, in the last 10 years,
speleologists from Italy,

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.804
Slovakia, Czech Republic,
and, of course, Venezuela and Brazil,

00:05:22.828 --> 00:05:25.807
have explored several caves in this area.

00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:28.318
So how can it be possible?

00:05:28.342 --> 00:05:32.403
To understand this contradiction,
we have to consider the time factor,

00:05:32.427 --> 00:05:35.730
because the history of the tepuis
is extremely long,

00:05:35.754 --> 00:05:40.411
starting about 1.6 billion years ago
with the formation of the rock,

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:46.975
and then evolving with the uplift
of the region 150 million years ago,

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.975
after the disruption
of the Pangaea supercontinent

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.352
and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:58.686
So you can imagine that the water had tens
or even hundreds of millions of years

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.768
to sculpt the strangest forms
on the tepuis' surfaces,

00:06:02.792 --> 00:06:08.806
but also to open the fractures
and form stone cities, rock cities,

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.351
fields of towers which are characterized
in the famous landscape of the tepuis.

00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:15.819
But nobody could have imagined

00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:20.579
what was happening inside a mountain
in so long a time frame.

00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:25.080
And so I was focusing in 2010
on one of those massifs,

00:06:25.104 --> 00:06:28.955
the Auyán-tepui, which is very famous
because it hosts Angel Falls,

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.568
which is the highest
waterfall in the world --

00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:35.651
about 979 meters of vertical drop.

00:06:35.675 --> 00:06:40.561
And I was searching for hints
of the existence of cave systems

00:06:40.585 --> 00:06:42.453
through satellite images,

00:06:42.477 --> 00:06:47.167
and finally we identified an area
of collapses of the surface --

00:06:47.191 --> 00:06:49.437
so, big boulders, rock piles --

00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:52.772
and that means that there
was a void below.

00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:56.745
It was a clear indication that there
was something inside the mountain.

00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:01.615
So we did several attempts
to reach this area,

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.401
by land and with a helicopter,

00:07:03.425 --> 00:07:06.975
but it was really difficult
because -- you have to imagine

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:11.378
that these mountains are covered
by clouds most of the year, by fog.

00:07:11.402 --> 00:07:12.775
There are strong winds,

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:17.381
and there are almost 4,000 millimeters
of rainfall per year,

00:07:17.405 --> 00:07:20.667
so it's really, really difficult
to find good conditions.

00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:25.474
And only in 2013 we finally
landed on the spot

00:07:25.498 --> 00:07:27.992
and we started
the exploration of the cave.

00:07:28.723 --> 00:07:30.640
The cave is huge.

00:07:30.664 --> 00:07:34.491
It's a huge network under the surface
of the tepui plateau,

00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:38.209
and in only ten days of expedition,

00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:42.356
we explored more than 20 kilometers
of cave passages.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.777
And it's a huge network
of underground rivers,

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:52.975
channels, big rooms,
extremely deep shafts.

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:56.023
So it's really an incredible place.

00:07:56.047 --> 00:07:58.588
And we named it Imawarì Yeuta.

00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:04.873
That means, in the Pemón indigenous
language, "The House of the Gods."

00:08:04.897 --> 00:08:08.679
You have to imagine that indigenous people
have never been there.

00:08:08.703 --> 00:08:12.208
It was impossible for them
to reach this area.

00:08:12.232 --> 00:08:14.438
However, there were legends
about the existence

00:08:14.462 --> 00:08:16.489
of a cave in the mountain.

00:08:16.513 --> 00:08:18.283
So when we started the exploration,

00:08:18.307 --> 00:08:20.537
we had to explore with a great respect,

00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:24.122
both because of the religious beliefs
of the indigenous people,

00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:26.511
but also because
it was really a sacred place,

00:08:26.535 --> 00:08:29.870
because no human had entered there before.

00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:31.697
So we had to use special protocols

00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:34.510
to not contaminate the environment
with our presence,

00:08:34.534 --> 00:08:36.709
and we tried also to share
with the community,

00:08:36.733 --> 00:08:39.406
with the indigenous community,
our discoveries.

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.986
And the caves represent, really,
a snapshot of the past.

00:08:44.503 --> 00:08:47.215
The time needed for their formation

00:08:47.239 --> 00:08:52.163
could be as long as 50 or even
100 million years,

00:08:52.187 --> 00:08:57.088
which makes them possibly the oldest caves
that we can explore on earth.

00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:04.648
What you can find there
is really evidence of a lost world.

00:09:05.301 --> 00:09:07.288
When you enter a quartzite cave,

00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:10.760
you have to completely forget
what you know about caves --

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:13.781
classic limestone caves
or the touristic caves

00:09:13.805 --> 00:09:16.162
that you can visit
in several places in the world.

00:09:16.186 --> 00:09:19.111
Because what seems
a simple stalactite here

00:09:19.135 --> 00:09:24.220
is not made by calcium carbonate,
but is made by opal,

00:09:24.244 --> 00:09:29.828
and one of those stalactites can require
tens of millions of years to be formed.

00:09:30.685 --> 00:09:34.762
But you can find even stranger forms,
like these mushrooms of silica

00:09:34.786 --> 00:09:36.860
growing on a boulder.

00:09:36.884 --> 00:09:40.670
And you can imagine our talks
when we were exploring the cave.

00:09:40.694 --> 00:09:45.687
We were the first entering
and discovering those unknown things,

00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:48.549
things like those monster eggs.

00:09:48.573 --> 00:09:52.969
And we were a bit scared
because it was all a discovery,

00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:55.076
and we didn't want to find a dinosaur.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.604
We didn't find a dinosaur.

00:09:56.628 --> 00:09:58.225
(Laughter)

00:09:58.249 --> 00:10:01.546
Anyway, actually, we know
that this kind of formation,

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.103
after several studies,

00:10:04.127 --> 00:10:07.352
we know that these kinds of formations
are living organisms.

00:10:07.376 --> 00:10:12.810
They are bacterial colonies using silica
to build mineral structures

00:10:12.834 --> 00:10:14.764
resembling stromatolites.

00:10:14.788 --> 00:10:19.309
Stromatolites are some of the oldest
forms of life that we can find on earth.

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:21.136
And here in the tepuis,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.843
the interesting thing is that these
bacteria colonies have evolved

00:10:25.867 --> 00:10:30.096
in complete isolation
from the external surface,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.744
and without being in contact with humans.

00:10:32.768 --> 00:10:35.365
They have never been
in contact with humans.

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:38.456
So the implications
for science are enormous,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.482
because here you could find,
for example, microbes

00:10:42.506 --> 00:10:47.458
that could be useful to resolve
diseases in medicine,

00:10:47.482 --> 00:10:51.418
or you could find even a new kind
of material with unknown properties.

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:55.501
And, in fact, we discovered in the cave
a new mineral structure for science,

00:10:55.525 --> 00:10:58.532
which is rossiantonite,
a phosphate-sulfate.

00:10:59.606 --> 00:11:04.320
So whatever you find in the cave,
even a small cricket,

00:11:04.344 --> 00:11:08.312
has evolved in the dark
in complete isolation.

00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:12.589
And, really, everything that you can feel
in the cave are real connections

00:11:12.613 --> 00:11:15.653
between the biological
and the mineralogical world.

00:11:16.544 --> 00:11:22.360
So as we explore this dark continent

00:11:22.384 --> 00:11:28.788
and discover its mineralogical
and biological diversity and uniqueness,

00:11:28.812 --> 00:11:33.181
we will find probably clues
about the origin of life on our planet

00:11:33.205 --> 00:11:36.182
and on the relationship
and evolution of life

00:11:36.206 --> 00:11:39.192
in relationship with the mineral world.

00:11:39.216 --> 00:11:43.158
What seems only a dark, empty environment

00:11:43.182 --> 00:11:45.975
could be in reality a chest of wonders

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:48.479
full of useful information.

00:11:50.102 --> 00:11:53.975
With a team of Italian, Venezuelan
and Brazilian speleologists,

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:57.190
which is called La Venta Teraphosa,

00:11:57.214 --> 00:11:59.282
we will be back soon to Latin America,

00:11:59.306 --> 00:12:04.754
because we want to explore other tepuis
in the farthest areas of the Amazon.

00:12:04.778 --> 00:12:07.798
There are still very unknown mountains,

00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:12.516
like Marahuaca, which is almost
3,000 meters high above sea level,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.639
or Aracà, which is in the upper region
of Rio Negro in Brazil.

00:12:16.663 --> 00:12:21.582
And we suppose that we could find there
even bigger cave systems,

00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:26.294
and each one with its own
undiscovered world.

00:12:26.636 --> 00:12:27.810
Thank you.

00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:33.288
(Applause)

00:12:33.312 --> 00:12:37.049
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Francesco.
Give me that to start so we don't forget.

00:12:37.073 --> 00:12:40.911
Francesco, you said we don't need
to go to Mars to find alien life,

00:12:40.935 --> 00:12:43.860
and indeed, last time we spoke,
you were in Sardinia

00:12:43.884 --> 00:12:46.127
and you were training European astronauts.

00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:49.625
So what do you, a speleologist,
tell and teach to the astronauts?

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:52.432
Francesco Sauro: Yeah, we are --
it's a program of training

00:12:52.456 --> 00:12:57.357
for not only European, but also NASA,
Roskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave.

00:12:57.381 --> 00:13:00.909
So they stay in a cave
for about one week in isolation.

00:13:00.933 --> 00:13:04.813
They have to work together
in a real, real dangerous environment,

00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:08.647
and it's a real alien environment for them
because it's unusual.

00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:12.975
It's always dark. They have to do science.
They have a lot of tasks.

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:15.531
And it's very similar to a journey to Mars

00:13:15.555 --> 00:13:17.227
or the International Space Station.

00:13:17.251 --> 00:13:18.510
BG: In principle.
FS: Yes.

00:13:18.534 --> 00:13:20.611
BG: I want to go back
to one of the pictures

00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:22.468
that was in your slide show,

00:13:22.492 --> 00:13:24.881
and it's just representative
of the other photos --

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:27.203
Weren't those photos amazing? Yeah?

00:13:27.227 --> 00:13:28.385
Audience: Yeah!

00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:32.145
(Applause)

00:13:32.169 --> 00:13:35.295
FS: I have to thank the photographers
from the team La Venta,

00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:39.092
because all of those photos
are from the photographers.

00:13:39.116 --> 00:13:42.818
BG: You bring, actually, photographers
with you in the expedition.

00:13:42.842 --> 00:13:45.809
They're professionals,
they're speleologists and photographers.

00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:50.733
But when I look at these pictures,
I wonder: there is zero light down there,

00:13:50.757 --> 00:13:53.540
and yet they look incredibly well-exposed.

00:13:53.564 --> 00:13:55.052
How do you take these pictures?

00:13:55.076 --> 00:13:58.127
How do your colleagues,
the photographers, take these pictures?

00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:00.642
FS: Yeah. They are working
in a darkroom, basically,

00:14:00.666 --> 00:14:02.785
so you can open the shutter of the camera

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:05.227
and use the lights
to paint the environment.

00:14:05.251 --> 00:14:06.506
BG: So you're basically --

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.265
FS: Yes. You can even keep
the shutter open for one minute

00:14:09.289 --> 00:14:10.813
and then paint the environment.

00:14:10.837 --> 00:14:13.541
The final result is what
you want to achieve.

00:14:13.565 --> 00:14:16.638
BG: You spray the environment with light
and that's what you get.

00:14:16.662 --> 00:14:19.104
Maybe we can try this at home
someday, I don't know.

00:14:19.128 --> 00:14:20.132
(Laughter)

00:14:20.156 --> 00:14:21.747
BG: Francesco, grazie.
FS: Grazie.

00:14:21.771 --> 00:14:24.999
(Applause)
