00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You can mimic what you can see.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm going to tell you about that technology.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
People have wanted to look inside the human mind,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the human brain, for thousands of years.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
People envision this as being very difficult.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It was terribly dangerous. (Laughter)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But now, we have a real technology to do this.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but more importantly, we can look into his mind.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
There have been three ways to try to impact the brain:

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the therapist's couch, pills and the knife.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and select brain areas to do that same thing.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
What you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They're watching their own brain activation,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
As they do it, in the upper left is a display

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
When they control their brain, they can control their pain.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This is an investigational technology,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This is not "The Matrix." You can only do this to yourself. You take control.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I've seen inside my brain. You will too, soon.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
When you do, what do you want to control?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
But I want to leave with you the big question.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
using this technology, the human mind and brain.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Where will we take it?
