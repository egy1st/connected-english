00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.816
A girl I've never met before

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.120
changed my life and the life
of thousands of other people.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.160
I'm the CEO of DoSomething.org.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.976
It's one of the largest organizations
in the world for young people.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.896
In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts
in the United States.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.456
And we're not homophobic.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.640
(Laughter)

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.616
And it's true -- the way we communicate
with young people is by text,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.000
because that's how
young people communicate.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.055
So we'll run over 200 campaigns this year,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.776
things like collecting peanut butter
for food pantries,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.640
or making Valentine's Day cards
for senior citizens who are homebound.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.456
And we'll text them.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.416
And we'll have a 97 percent open rate.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.136
It'll over-index Hispanic and urban.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.136
We collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.536
and over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.336
This is big scale. OK --

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.040
(Applause)

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.280
But there's one weird side effect.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.936
Every time we send out a text message,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.256
we get back a few dozen text messages
having nothing to do with peanut butter

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.056
or hunger or senior citizens --

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.576
but text messages about being bullied,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.400
text messages about being addicted to pot.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.160
And the worst message
we ever got said exactly this:

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.200
"He won't stop raping me.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.240
It's my dad.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.840
He told me not to tell anyone.
Are you there?"

00:01:38.238 --> 00:01:40.096
We couldn't believe this was happening.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.776
We couldn't believe that something
so horrific could happen to a human being,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.440
and that she would share it with us --
something so intimate, so personal.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.736
And we realized
we had to stop triaging this

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.760
and we had to build a crisis text line
for these people in pain.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.080
So we launched Crisis Text Line,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.456
very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso --
just a few thousand people in each market.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.216
And in four months,
we were in all 295 area codes in America.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.860
Just to put that into perspective,

00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:14.496
that's zero marketing and faster growth
than when Facebook first launched.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.056
(Applause)

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.456
Text is unbelievably private.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.176
No one hears you talking.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.296
So we spike everyday at lunch time --

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.016
kids are sitting at the lunch table

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.216
and you think that she's texting
the cute boy across the hall,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.880
but she's actually texting us
about her bulimia.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.056
And we don't get the word "like"
or "um" or hyperventilating or crying.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.840
We just get facts.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.816
We get things like, "I want to die.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.760
I have a bottle of pills
on the desk in front of me."

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.296
And so the crisis counselor says,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.320
"How about you put those pills
in the drawer while we text?"

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.136
And they go back and forth for a while.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.160
And the crisis counselor
gets the girl to give her her address,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.896
because if you're texting
a text line, you want help.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.096
So she gets the address

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.296
and the counselor triggers
an active rescue

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.320
while they're texting back and forth.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.216
And then it goes quiet --

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.880
23 minutes with no response
from this girl.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.616
And the next message that comes in says --

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.256
it's the mom --

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.856
"I had no idea, and I was in the house,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.360
we're in an ambulance
on our way to the hospital."

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.080
As a mom that one just --

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.880
The next message comes a month later.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.976
"I just got out of the hospital.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.520
I was diagnosed as bipolar,
and I think I'm going to be OK."

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.136
(Applause)

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.816
I would love to tell you
that that's an unusual exchange,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.376
but we're doing on average
2.41 active rescues a day.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.360
Thirty percent of our text messages
are about suicide and depression -- huge.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.936
The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.536
is that these are strangers
counseling other strangers

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.216
on the most intimate issues,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.616
and getting them from hot moments
to cold moments.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.936
It's exciting, and I will tell you

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.216
that we have done a total
of more than 6.5 million text messages

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.536
in less than two years.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.536
(Applause)

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.776
But the thing that really gets me
hot and sweaty about this,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.656
the thing that really gets me
psyched is the data:

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.016
6.5 million messages --

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.680
that's the volume, velocity and variety
to provide a really juicy corpus.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.856
We can do things like predictive work.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.416
We can do all kinds of conclusions
and learnings from that data set.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.656
So we can be better,
and the world can be better.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.096
So how do we use the data
to make us better?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.456
Alright, chances are someone here,
someone watching this

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.056
has seen a therapist or a shrink
at some point in time in your life --

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.747
you do not have to raise your hand.

00:04:57.771 --> 00:04:59.376
(Laughter)

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.656
How do you know that person's any good?

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.936
Oh, they have a degree
from Harvard on the wall?

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.627
Are you sure he didn't graduate
in the bottom 10 percent?

00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:08.056
(Laughter)

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.296
When my husband and I
saw a marriage counselor,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.273
I thought she was a genius when she said,

00:05:12.297 --> 00:05:15.736
"I'll see you guys in two weeks --
but I need to see you next week, sir."

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.416
(Laughter)

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.360
We have the data to know
what makes a great counselor.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.656
We know that if you text
the words "numbs" and "sleeve,"

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.816
there's a 99 percent match for cutting.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.656
We know that if you text
in the words "mg" and "rubber band,"

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.960
there's a 99 percent match
for substance abuse.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.096
And we know that if you text in
"sex," "oral" and "Mormon,"

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.880
you're questioning if you're gay.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.656
Now that's interesting information
that a counselor could figure out

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.816
but that algorithm in our hands
means that an automatic pop-up says,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.216
"99 percent match for cutting --
try asking one of these questions"

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.576
to prompt the counselor.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.376
Or "99 percent match for substance abuse,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.040
here are three drug clinics
near the texter."

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.240
It makes us more accurate.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.976
On the day that Robin Williams
committed suicide,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.256
people flooded hotlines
all over this country.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.536
It was sad to see an icon,
a funnyman, commit suicide,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.256
and there were three hour wait times
on every phone hotline in the country.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.616
We had a spike in volume also.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.896
The difference was

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.856
if you text us, "I want to die,"
or "I want to kill myself,"

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.336
the algorithm reads that,
you're code orange,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.536
and you become number one in the queue.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.656
So we can handle severity,
not chronological.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.816
(Applause)

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.176
This data is also making the world better

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.696
because I'm sitting on the world's
first map of real-time crises.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.936
Think about it:

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.336
those 6.5 million messages, auto-tagging
through natural language processes,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.856
all of these data points --

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.760
I can tell you that the worst day
of the week for eating disorders: Monday.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.920
The worst time of day
for substance abuse: 5am.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.336
And that Montana is
a beautiful place to visit

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.136
but you do not want to live there,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.720
because it is the number one state
for suicidal ideation.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.816
And we've made this data public
and free and open.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.936
We've pulled all the personally
identifiable information.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.216
And it's in a place
called CrisisTrends.org.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.576
Because I want schools to be able to see

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.936
that Monday is the worst day
for eating disorders,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.816
so that they can plan meals

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.256
and guidance counselors
to be there on Mondays.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.016
And I want families to see that
substance abuse questions spike at 5am.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.320
I want somebody to take care of those
Native American reservations in Montana.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.016
(Applause)

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.320
Data, evidence

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.056
makes policy, research,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.256
journalism, policing, school boards --
everything better.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.656
I don't think of myself
as a mental health activist.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.816
I think of myself
as a national health activist.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.720
I get really excited about this data,
I'm a little nerdy.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.136
Yeah, that sounded too girly.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.576
I'm nerdy.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.096
(Laughter)

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.080
I love data.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.816
And the only difference really between me
and those people in hoodies down the road

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.856
with their fat-funded companies,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.696
is that I'm not inspired by helping you
find Chinese food at 2am in Dallas,

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.736
or helping you touch your wrist
and get a car immediately,

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.616
or swipe right and get laid.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.015
I'm inspired --

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:48.816
(Laughter, applause)

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.416
I want to use tech and data
to make the world a better place.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.136
I want to use it to help that girl,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.440
who texted in about 
being raped by her father.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.296
Because the truth is
we never heard from her again.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.016
And I hope that she is
somewhere safe and healthy,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.296
and I hope that she sees this talk

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.936
and she knows that her desperation

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.896
and her courage inspired
the creation of Crisis Text Line

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.320
and inspires me every freaking day.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.760
(Applause)
