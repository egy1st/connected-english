00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:03.249
I want to tell you three stories

00:00:03.273 --> 00:00:05.725
about the power of relationships

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:10.038
to solve the deep and complex
social problems of this century.

00:00:10.062 --> 00:00:12.975
You know, sometimes it seems
like all these problems

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:17.788
of poverty, inequality, ill health,
unemployment, violence, addiction --

00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:20.638
they're right there in one person's life.

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:24.343
So I want to tell you about someone
like this that I know.

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:26.436
I'm going to call her Ella.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.166
Ella lives in a British city
on a run down estate.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.384
The shops are closed, the pub's gone,

00:00:32.408 --> 00:00:34.707
the playground's pretty desolate
and never used,

00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:37.557
and inside Ella's house,
the tension is palpable

00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:39.581
and the noise levels are deafening.

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.419
The TV's on at full volume.

00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:43.975
One of her sons is fighting
with one of her daughters.

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.770
Another son, Ryan, is keeping up this
constant stream of abuse from the kitchen,

00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:50.975
and the dogs are locked
behind the bedroom door and straining.

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:52.711
Ella is stuck.

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:55.295
She has lived with crisis for 40 years.

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:59.053
She knows nothing else,
and she knows no way out.

00:00:59.077 --> 00:01:01.726
She's had a whole series
of abusive partners,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.067
and, tragically, one of her children has
been taken into care by social services.

00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:08.363
The three children
that still live with her

00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:11.862
suffer from a whole range of problems,
and none of them are in education.

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:14.883
And Ella says to me that she
is repeating the cycle

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:17.671
of her own mother's life before her.

00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:20.975
But when I met Ella,
there were 73 different services

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.137
on offer for her and her family
in the city where she lives,

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:28.430
73 different services
run out of 24 departments in one city,

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:31.764
and Ella and her partners and her children
were known to most of them.

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:33.902
They think nothing of calling
social services

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:36.778
to try and mediate one of the many
arguments that broke out.

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:40.251
And the family home was visited
on a regular basis by social workers,

00:01:40.275 --> 00:01:44.975
youth workers, a health officer,
a housing officer, a home tutor

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.975
and the local policemen.

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.737
And the governments say
that there are 100,000 families

00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:51.860
in Britain today like Ella's,

00:01:51.884 --> 00:01:57.245
struggling to break the cycle of economic,
social and environmental deprivation.

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:59.443
And they also say
that managing this problem

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:02.469
costs a quarter of a million pounds
per family per year

00:02:02.493 --> 00:02:03.865
and yet nothing changes.

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.975
None of these well-meaning visitors
are making a difference.

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.282
This is a chart we made in the same city
with another family like Ella's.

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:14.908
This shows 30 years of intervention
in that family's life.

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:18.763
And just as with Ella, not one of these
interventions is part of an overall plan.

00:02:18.787 --> 00:02:20.234
There's no end goal in sight.

00:02:20.258 --> 00:02:23.309
None of the interventions
are dealing with the underlying issues.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.343
These are just containment measures,
ways of managing a problem.

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:28.086
One of the policemen says to me,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.599
"Look, I just deliver the message
and then I leave."

00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:33.308
So, I've spent time living
with families like Ella's

00:02:33.332 --> 00:02:34.872
in different parts of the world,

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:37.134
because I want to know: what can we learn

00:02:37.158 --> 00:02:40.651
from places where our social institutions
just aren't working?

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:43.466
I want to know what it feels like
to live in Ella's family.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.501
I want to know what's going on
and what we can do differently.

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:51.614
Well, the first thing I learned
is that cost is a really slippery concept.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:54.356
Because when the government says
that a family like Ella's

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.977
costs a quarter of a million pounds
a year to manage,

00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:58.152
what it really means

00:02:58.176 --> 00:03:01.146
is that this system costs
a quarter of a million pounds a year.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.285
Because not one penny of this money
actually touches Ella's family

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.889
in a way that makes a difference.

00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:08.456
Instead, the system is just
like this costly gyroscope

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.459
that spins around the families,
keeping them stuck at its heart,

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.508
exactly where they are.

00:03:13.532 --> 00:03:15.855
And I also spent time
with the frontline workers,

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.702
and I learned that it
is an impossible situation.

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:23.441
So Tom, who is the social worker
for Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan,

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.975
has to spend 86 percent of his time
servicing the system:

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.070
meetings with colleagues,
filling out forms,

00:03:29.094 --> 00:03:31.522
more meetings with colleagues
to discuss the forms,

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:32.792
and maybe most shockingly,

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:35.385
the 14 percent of the time
he has to be with Ryan

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.905
is spent getting data
and information for the system.

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:39.080
So he says to Ryan,

00:03:39.104 --> 00:03:41.791
"How often have you been smoking?
Have you been drinking?

00:03:41.815 --> 00:03:43.128
When did you go to school?"

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:45.702
And this kind of interaction
rules out the possibility

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:46.938
of a normal conversation.

00:03:46.962 --> 00:03:49.080
It rules out the possibility
of what's needed

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:52.081
to build a relationship
between Tom and Ryan.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.388
When we made this chart,

00:03:54.412 --> 00:03:56.427
the frontline workers,
the professionals --

00:03:56.451 --> 00:03:58.222
they stared at it absolutely amazed.

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:00.975
It snaked around the walls
of their offices.

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:06.975
So many hours, so well meant,
but ultimately so futile.

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.439
And there was this moment
of absolute breakdown,

00:04:10.463 --> 00:04:12.295
and then of clarity:

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.932
we had to work in a different way.

00:04:15.652 --> 00:04:18.957
So in a really brave step,
the leaders of the city where Ella lives

00:04:18.981 --> 00:04:21.626
agreed that we could start
by reversing Ryan's ratio.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.810
So everyone who came into contact
with Ella or a family like Ella's

00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:27.746
would spend 80 percent of their time
working with the families

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.335
and only 20 percent servicing the system.

00:04:30.359 --> 00:04:32.210
And even more radically,

00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:33.404
the families would lead

00:04:33.428 --> 00:04:36.755
and they would decide who
was in a best position to help them.

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:40.138
So Ella and another mother were asked
to be part of an interview panel,

00:04:40.162 --> 00:04:42.485
to choose from amongst
the existing professionals

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.776
who would work with them.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.766
And many, many people wanted to join us,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.861
because you don't go into this kind
of work to manage a system,

00:04:49.885 --> 00:04:52.738
you go in because you can
and you want to make a difference.

00:04:52.762 --> 00:04:55.975
So Ella and the mother asked
everybody who came through the door,

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:58.431
"What will you do when my son
starts kicking me?"

00:04:58.455 --> 00:05:00.975
And so the first person who comes in says,

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.118
"Well, I'll look around
for the nearest exit

00:05:03.142 --> 00:05:05.975
and I will back out very slowly,

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.000
and if the noise is still going on,
I'll call my supervisor."

00:05:09.024 --> 00:05:11.737
And the mothers go,
"You're the system. Get out of here!"

00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:14.975
And then the next person who comes
is a policeman, and he says,

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:18.975
"Well, I'll tackle your son to the ground
and then I'm not sure what I'll do."

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:20.677
And the mothers say, "Thank you."

00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:22.923
So, they chose professionals who confessed

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.917
they didn't necessarily have the answers,

00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.530
who said -- well, they weren't
going to talk in jargon.

00:05:28.554 --> 00:05:31.443
They showed their human qualities
and convinced the mothers

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:34.080
that they would stick with them
through thick and thin,

00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:36.163
even though they wouldn't
be soft with them.

00:05:36.187 --> 00:05:37.879
So these new teams and the families

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:40.062
were then given a sliver
of the former budget,

00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:42.577
but they could spend the money
in any way they chose.

00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:44.836
And so one of the families
went out for supper.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.465
They went to McDonald's and they sat down
and they talked and they listened

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:50.549
for the first time in a long time.

00:05:50.573 --> 00:05:52.163
Another family asked the team

00:05:52.187 --> 00:05:55.229
if they would help them do up their home.

00:05:55.253 --> 00:05:56.760
And one mother took the money

00:05:56.784 --> 00:06:00.311
and she used it as a float
to start a social enterprise.

00:06:00.335 --> 00:06:02.784
And in a really short space of time,

00:06:02.808 --> 00:06:05.217
something new started to grow:

00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:08.139
a relationship between the team
and the workers.

00:06:08.163 --> 00:06:11.080
And then some remarkable
changes took place.

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:12.624
Maybe it's not surprising

00:06:12.648 --> 00:06:15.382
that the journey for Ella has had
some big steps backwards

00:06:15.406 --> 00:06:16.567
as well as forwards.

00:06:16.591 --> 00:06:19.356
But today, she's completed
an IT training course,

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.668
she has her first paid job,
her children are back in school,

00:06:22.692 --> 00:06:23.843
and the neighbors,

00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:26.776
who previously just hoped this family
would be moved anywhere

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.006
except next door to them,

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.181
are fine.

00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:31.305
They've made some new friendships.

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:35.345
And all the same people have been
involved in this transformation --

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:37.975
same families, same workers.

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:41.906
But the relationship between them
has been supported to change.

00:06:42.556 --> 00:06:45.637
So I'm telling you about Ella
because I think that relationships

00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:47.598
are the critical resource we have

00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:50.000
in solving some of these
intractable problems.

00:06:50.024 --> 00:06:52.746
But today, our relationships
are all but written off

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.638
by our politics, our social policies,
our welfare institutions.

00:06:56.662 --> 00:06:59.338
And I've learned that this
really has to change.

00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:01.952
So what do I mean by relationships?

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:05.415
I'm talking about the simple
human bonds between us,

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:07.975
a kind of authentic sense
of connection, of belonging,

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:10.683
the bonds that make us happy,
that support us to change,

00:07:10.707 --> 00:07:13.511
to be brave like Ella
and try something new.

00:07:13.535 --> 00:07:15.455
And, you know, it's no accident

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:18.018
that those who run and work
in the institutions

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:20.300
that are supposed to support
Ella and her family

00:07:20.324 --> 00:07:21.838
don't talk about relationships,

00:07:21.862 --> 00:07:25.934
because relationships are expressly
designed out of a welfare model

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.416
that was drawn up in Britain
and exported around the world.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.373
The contemporaries of William Beveridge,

00:07:31.397 --> 00:07:33.655
who was the architect
of the first welfare state

00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:35.599
and the author of the Beveridge Report,

00:07:35.623 --> 00:07:39.122
had little faith in what they called
the average sensual or emotional man.

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:42.590
Instead, they trusted this idea
of the impersonal system

00:07:42.614 --> 00:07:46.975
and the bureaucrat who would be detached
and work in this system.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:49.114
And the impact of Beveridge

00:07:49.138 --> 00:07:51.381
on the way the modern state
sees social issues

00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:53.464
just can't be underestimated.

00:07:53.488 --> 00:07:56.664
The Beveridge Report
sold over 100,000 copies

00:07:56.688 --> 00:07:59.017
in the first weeks of publication alone.

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:02.250
People queued in the rain
on a November night to get hold of a copy,

00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:05.640
and it was read across the country,
across the colonies, across Europe,

00:08:05.664 --> 00:08:07.405
across the United States of America,

00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:09.201
and it had this huge impact

00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:12.822
on the way that welfare states
were designed around the globe.

00:08:12.846 --> 00:08:17.907
The cultures, the bureaucracies,
the institutions -- they are global,

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:19.951
and they've come to seem
like common sense.

00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:22.059
They've become so ingrained in us,

00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:24.330
that actually we don't even
see them anymore.

00:08:24.856 --> 00:08:27.975
And I think it's really important to say
that in the 20th century,

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:30.636
they were remarkably successful,
these institutions.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.091
They led to longer lifespans,
the eradication of mass disease,

00:08:34.115 --> 00:08:37.106
mass housing, almost universal education.

00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:39.975
But at the same time,

00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:43.431
Beveridge sowed the seeds
of today's challenges.

00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:45.763
So let me tell you a second story.

00:08:45.787 --> 00:08:50.999
What do you think today is a bigger killer
than a lifetime of smoking?

00:08:53.226 --> 00:08:54.834
It's loneliness.

00:08:55.741 --> 00:09:00.657
According to government statistics,
one person over 60 -- one in three --

00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:03.873
doesn't speak to or see
another person in a week.

00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:07.975
One person in 10, that's 850,000 people,

00:09:07.999 --> 00:09:10.334
doesn't speak to anyone else in a month.

00:09:10.924 --> 00:09:13.198
And we're not the only people
with this problem;

00:09:13.222 --> 00:09:15.653
this problem touches the whole
of the Western world.

00:09:15.677 --> 00:09:17.975
And it's even more acute
in countries like China,

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:21.682
where a process of rapid urbanization,
mass migration, has left older people

00:09:21.706 --> 00:09:23.250
alone in the villages.

00:09:23.274 --> 00:09:27.095
And so the services that Beveridge
designed and exported --

00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:29.406
they can't address this kind of problem.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.040
Loneliness is like a collective
relational challenge,

00:09:32.064 --> 00:09:35.911
and it can't be addressed
by a traditional bureaucratic response.

00:09:36.486 --> 00:09:39.437
So some years ago,
wanting to understand this problem,

00:09:39.461 --> 00:09:42.334
I started to work with a group
of about 60 older people

00:09:42.358 --> 00:09:44.179
in South London, where I live.

00:09:44.203 --> 00:09:46.278
I went shopping, I played bingo,

00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:48.465
but mainly I was just
observing and listening.

00:09:48.489 --> 00:09:51.034
I wanted to know
what we could do differently.

00:09:51.837 --> 00:09:54.665
And if you ask them, people tell you
they want two things.

00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:57.598
They want somebody to go up a ladder
and change a light bulb,

00:09:57.622 --> 00:09:59.920
or to be there when they
come out of hospital.

00:09:59.944 --> 00:10:02.298
They want on-demand, practical support.

00:10:02.322 --> 00:10:03.880
And they want to have fun.

00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:07.122
They want to go out, do interesting things
with like-minded people,

00:10:07.146 --> 00:10:10.866
and make friends like we've all
made friends at every stage of our lives.

00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:14.207
So we rented a phone line,
hired a couple of handymen,

00:10:14.231 --> 00:10:16.568
and started a service we called "Circle."

00:10:16.592 --> 00:10:20.413
And Circle offers its local membership
a toll-free 0 800 number

00:10:20.437 --> 00:10:23.166
that they can call on demand
for any support.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.359
And people have called us
for so many reasons.

00:10:25.383 --> 00:10:27.502
They've called because
their pets are unwell,

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:30.800
their DVD is broken, they've forgotten
how to use their mobile phone,

00:10:30.824 --> 00:10:32.749
or maybe they are coming out of hospital

00:10:32.773 --> 00:10:34.426
and they want someone to be there.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.600
And Circle also offers
a rich social calendar --

00:10:37.624 --> 00:10:41.739
knitting, darts, museum tours,
hot air ballooning -- you name it.

00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:46.650
But here's the interesting thing,
the really deep change:

00:10:46.674 --> 00:10:49.885
over time, the friendships
that have formed

00:10:49.909 --> 00:10:52.463
have begun to replace the practical offer.

00:10:52.964 --> 00:10:54.597
So let me tell you about Belinda.

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:58.857
Belinda's a Circle member, and she was
going into hospital for a hip operation,

00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:02.865
so she called her local Circle to say
they wouldn't see her for a bit.

00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:06.689
And Damon, who runs the local Circle,
calls her back and says, "How can I help?"

00:11:06.713 --> 00:11:08.624
And Belinda says, "Oh no, I'm fine --

00:11:08.648 --> 00:11:11.441
Jocelyn is doing the shopping,
Tony's doing the gardening,

00:11:11.465 --> 00:11:14.162
Melissa and Joe are going
to come in and cook and chat."

00:11:14.186 --> 00:11:17.193
So five Circle members
had organized themselves

00:11:17.217 --> 00:11:19.121
to take care of Belinda.

00:11:20.123 --> 00:11:23.469
And Belinda's 80, although she says
that she feels 25 inside,

00:11:23.493 --> 00:11:25.057
but she also says

00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:28.527
that she felt stuck and pretty down
when she joined Circle.

00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:33.564
But the simple act of encouraging her
to come along to that first event

00:11:33.588 --> 00:11:36.788
led to a process where
natural friendships formed,

00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:41.133
friendships that today are replacing
the need for expensive services.

00:11:41.157 --> 00:11:44.134
It's relationships
that are making the difference.

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:48.480
So I think that three factors
have converged

00:11:48.504 --> 00:11:51.496
that enable us to put relationships
at the heart and center

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.365
of how we solve social problems today.

00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:56.452
Firstly, the nature of the problems --

00:11:56.476 --> 00:11:59.131
they've changed, and they require
different solutions.

00:11:59.155 --> 00:12:03.645
Secondly, the cost, human as much
as financial, of doing business as usual.

00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:05.404
And thirdly, technology.

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:08.529
I've talked about the first two factors.

00:12:08.553 --> 00:12:11.501
It's technology that enables
these approaches to scale

00:12:11.525 --> 00:12:14.479
and potentially now support
thousands of people.

00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:17.070
So the technology we've used
is really simple,

00:12:17.094 --> 00:12:20.547
it's made up of available things
like databases, mobile phones.

00:12:20.571 --> 00:12:23.307
Circle has got this very simple
system that underpins it,

00:12:23.331 --> 00:12:27.191
enables a small local team to support
a membership of up to a thousand.

00:12:27.215 --> 00:12:29.988
And you can contrast this
with a neighborhood organization

00:12:30.012 --> 00:12:31.169
of the 1970s,

00:12:31.193 --> 00:12:33.356
when this kind of scale
just wasn't possible,

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.496
neither was the quality or the longevity
that the spine of technology can provide.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.749
So it's relationships
underpinned by technology

00:12:40.773 --> 00:12:43.686
that can turn the Beveridge
models on their heads.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.356
The Beveridge models are all
about institutions with finite resources,

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.821
anonymously managing access.

00:12:49.845 --> 00:12:51.465
In my work at the front line,

00:12:51.489 --> 00:12:55.175
I've seen again and again how
up to 80 percent of resource

00:12:55.199 --> 00:12:57.234
is spent keeping people out.

00:12:57.258 --> 00:12:58.948
So professionals have to administer

00:12:58.972 --> 00:13:01.366
these increasingly complex forms
of administration

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.732
that are basically about stopping people
accessing the service

00:13:04.756 --> 00:13:06.483
or managing the queue.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.266
And Circle, like the relational services
that we and others have designed,

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.655
inverts this logic.

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:16.672
What it says is, the more people,
the more relationships,

00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:18.752
the stronger the solution.

00:13:19.734 --> 00:13:22.096
So I want to tell you my third
and final story,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.079
which is about unemployment.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.066
In Britain, as in most places
in the world,

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.630
our welfare states were primarily designed

00:13:30.654 --> 00:13:33.299
to get people into work,

00:13:33.323 --> 00:13:35.315
to educate them for this,

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:37.011
and to keep them healthy.

00:13:37.035 --> 00:13:39.568
But here, too, the systems are failing.

00:13:39.592 --> 00:13:40.964
And so the response has been

00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:44.525
to try and make these old systems
even more efficient and transactional --

00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:48.181
to speed up processing times, divide
people into ever-smaller categories,

00:13:48.205 --> 00:13:51.376
try and target services at them
more efficiently -- in other words,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.046
the very opposite of relational.

00:13:55.425 --> 00:13:58.829
But guess how most people find work today?

00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:01.375
Through word of mouth.

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:06.000
It turns out that in Britain today,
most new jobs are not advertised.

00:14:06.024 --> 00:14:08.167
So it's friends that tell you about a job,

00:14:08.191 --> 00:14:10.464
it's friends that recommend you for a job,

00:14:10.488 --> 00:14:14.779
and it's a rich and diverse social network
that helps you find work.

00:14:14.803 --> 00:14:17.128
Maybe some of you here
this evening are thinking,

00:14:17.152 --> 00:14:19.013
"But I found my job through an advert,"

00:14:19.037 --> 00:14:22.359
but if you think back, it was probably
a friend that showed you the ad

00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:23.960
and then encouraged you to apply.

00:14:23.984 --> 00:14:25.307
But not surprisingly,

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:28.610
people who perhaps most need
this rich and diverse network

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:31.333
are those who are most isolated from it.

00:14:31.357 --> 00:14:32.632
So knowing this,

00:14:32.656 --> 00:14:35.678
and also knowing about the costs
and failure of current systems,

00:14:35.702 --> 00:14:38.651
we designed something new
with relationships at its heart.

00:14:38.675 --> 00:14:44.037
We designed a service
that encourages people to meet up,

00:14:44.061 --> 00:14:45.501
people in and out of work,

00:14:45.525 --> 00:14:47.276
to work together in structured ways

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.217
and try new opportunities.

00:14:50.308 --> 00:14:54.279
And, well, it's very hard to compare
the results of these new systems

00:14:54.303 --> 00:14:55.975
with the old transactional models,

00:14:55.999 --> 00:14:58.300
but it looks like,
with our first 1,000 members,

00:14:58.324 --> 00:15:01.215
we outperformed existing services
by a factor of three,

00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:03.199
at a fraction of the cost.

00:15:03.223 --> 00:15:06.103
And here, too, we've used technology,

00:15:06.127 --> 00:15:09.525
but not to network people in the way
that a social platform would do.

00:15:09.549 --> 00:15:13.151
We've used it to bring people face to face
and connect them with each other,

00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:16.592
building real relationships
and supporting people to find work.

00:15:18.308 --> 00:15:21.255
At the end of his life, in 1948,

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:23.268
Beveridge wrote a third report.

00:15:23.913 --> 00:15:27.274
And in it he said he had made
a dreadful mistake.

00:15:28.356 --> 00:15:32.179
He had left people
and their communities out.

00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:37.716
And this omission, he said,
led to seeing people,

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.875
and people starting to see themselves,

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:43.684
within the categories
of the bureaucracies and the institutions.

00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:46.473
And human relationships
were already withering.

00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:50.512
But unfortunately, this third report
was much less read

00:15:50.536 --> 00:15:52.311
than Beveridge's earlier work.

00:15:53.115 --> 00:15:57.326
But today, we need to bring people
and their communities

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.477
back into the heart of the way
we design new systems and new services,

00:16:01.501 --> 00:16:04.008
in an approach that I call
"Relational Welfare."

00:16:04.032 --> 00:16:06.548
We need to leave behind
these old, transactional,

00:16:06.572 --> 00:16:08.830
unsuitable, outdated models,

00:16:08.854 --> 00:16:12.365
and we need to adopt instead
the shared collective relational responses

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.845
that can support a family like Ella's,

00:16:14.869 --> 00:16:17.176
that can address an issue like loneliness,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.935
that can support people into work
and up the skills curve

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:21.403
in a modern labor market,

00:16:21.427 --> 00:16:25.565
that can also address challenges
of education, of health care systems,

00:16:25.589 --> 00:16:29.869
and so many more of those problems
that are pressing on our societies.

00:16:30.306 --> 00:16:32.868
It is all about relationships.

00:16:33.324 --> 00:16:36.351
Relationships are the critical
resource we have.

00:16:36.375 --> 00:16:37.526
Thank you.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:42.999
(Applause)
