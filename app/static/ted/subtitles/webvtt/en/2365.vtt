WEBVTT

00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.341
A year ago, we were invited
by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:06.388
to present our art projects.

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:11.133
We are used to invitations,
but this invitation really thrilled us.

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:14.427
The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:17.419
It is the only old building
in the government district

00:00:17.443 --> 00:00:20.399
that was not destroyed
during the Second World War,

00:00:20.423 --> 00:00:23.191
and it sits right next
to the Federal Chancellery.

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:27.839
No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel
than the Swiss diplomats.

00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:29.839
(Laughter)

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:34.475
The government district in Berlin
also contains the Reichstag --

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:37.310
Germany's parliament --
and the Brandenburg Gate,

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:40.275
and right next to the gate
there are other embassies,

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:43.696
in particular the US
and the British Embassy.

00:00:44.657 --> 00:00:47.873
Although Germany is an advanced democracy,

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:50.858
citizens are limited
in their constitutional rights

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.275
in its government district.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.686
The right of assembly and the right
to demonstrate are restricted there.

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:01.275
And this is interesting
from an artistic point of view.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.011
The opportunities to exercise
participation and to express oneself

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:08.275
are always bound to a certain order

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.774
and always subject
to a specific regulation.

00:01:11.798 --> 00:01:16.557
With an awareness of the dependencies
of these regulations,

00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:19.275
we can gain a new perspective.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.953
The given terms and conditions
shape our perception, our actions

00:01:23.977 --> 00:01:25.564
and our lives.

00:01:26.168 --> 00:01:29.275
And this is crucial in another context.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.777
Over the last couple of years,

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:35.275
we learned that from the roofs
of the US and the British Embassy,

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.036
the secret services have been listening
to the entire district,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.756
including the mobile phone
of Angela Merkel.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.275
The antennas of the British GCHQ are
hidden in a white cylindrical radome,

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.316
while the listening post
of the American NSA

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.299
is covered by radio transparent screens.

00:01:55.342 --> 00:01:58.275
But how to address these hidden
and disguised forces?

00:01:58.903 --> 00:02:01.275
With my colleague, Christoph Wachter,

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.902
we accepted the invitation
of the Swiss Embassy.

00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:08.886
And we used this opportunity
to exploit the specific situation.

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:13.650
If people are spying on us,
it stands to reason

00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:16.275
that they have to listen
to what we are saying.

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.275
(Laughter)

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.299
On the roof of the Swiss Embassy,
we installed a series of antennas.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.983
They weren't as sophisticated as those
used by the Americans and the British.

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:32.274
(Laughter)

00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:34.021
They were makeshift can antennas,

00:02:34.045 --> 00:02:37.034
not camouflaged but totally
obvious and visible.

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.794
The Academy of Arts joined the project,

00:02:40.818 --> 00:02:44.508
and so we built another
large antenna on their rooftop,

00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:48.550
exactly between the listening posts
of the NSA and the GCHQ.

00:02:48.574 --> 00:02:50.430
(Laughter)

00:02:50.454 --> 00:02:55.275
Never have we been observed in such detail
while building an art installation.

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.551
A helicopter circled over our heads

00:02:57.575 --> 00:03:00.805
with a camera registering
each and every move we made,

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.039
and on the roof of the US Embassy,
security officers patrolled.

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:10.688
Although the government district
is governed by a strict police order,

00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:14.871
there are no specific laws
relating to digital communication.

00:03:15.548 --> 00:03:19.031
Our installation
was therefore perfectly legal,

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:22.252
and the Swiss Ambassador
informed Chancellor Merkel about it.

00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:25.980
We named the project "Can You Hear Me?"

00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:27.980
(Laughter)

00:03:28.805 --> 00:03:33.066
The antennas created an open
and free Wi-Fi communication network

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.275
in which anyone who wanted to
would be able to participate

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.411
using any Wi-Fi-enabled device
without any hindrance,

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:41.356
and be able to send messages

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.460
to those listening on the frequencies
that were being intercepted.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.005
Text messages, voice chat, file sharing --

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.678
anything could be sent anonymously.

00:03:52.852 --> 00:03:55.275
And people did communicate.

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.275
Over 15,000 messages were sent.

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.051
Here are some examples.

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.811
"Hello world, hello Berlin,
hello NSA, hello GCHQ."

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:11.299
"NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing!
Blow the whistle!"

00:04:12.884 --> 00:04:16.588
"This is the NSA. In God we trust.
All others we track!!!!!"

00:04:16.612 --> 00:04:18.864
(Laughter)

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:24.275
"#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ -
we are part of your organizations.

00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:26.299
# expect us. We will #shutdown"

00:04:27.483 --> 00:04:30.943
"This is the NSA's Achilles heel.
Open Networks."

00:04:30.967 --> 00:04:35.705
"Agents, what twisted story of yourself
will you tell your grandchildren?"

00:04:36.454 --> 00:04:40.870
"@NSA My neighbors are noisy.
Please send a drone strike."

00:04:40.894 --> 00:04:43.346
(Laughter)

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.840
"Make Love, Not cyberwar."

00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:50.275
We invited the embassies
and the government departments

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:53.105
to participate in the open network, too,

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.042
and to our surprise, they did.

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:57.986
Files appeared on the network,
including classified documents

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.628
leaked from the parliamentary
investigation commission,

00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:04.342
which highlights that the free exchange
and discussion of vital information

00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:08.706
is starting to become difficult,
even for members of a parliament.

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:13.068
We also organized guided tours
to experience and sound out

00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:15.142
the power constellations on-site.

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:18.503
The tours visited the restricted zones
around the embassies,

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:22.926
and we discussed the potential
and the highlights of communication.

00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:28.478
If we become aware of the constellation,

00:05:28.502 --> 00:05:31.298
the terms and conditions of communication,

00:05:31.322 --> 00:05:33.653
it not only broadens our horizon,

00:05:33.677 --> 00:05:37.549
it allows us to look behind
the regulations that limit our worldview,

00:05:37.573 --> 00:05:41.699
our specific social, political
or aesthetic conventions.

00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:44.414
Let's look at an actual example.

00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:48.470
The fate of people living
in the makeshift settlements

00:05:48.494 --> 00:05:50.221
on the outskirts of Paris

00:05:50.245 --> 00:05:52.409
is hidden and faded from view.

00:05:53.299 --> 00:05:54.758
It's a vicious circle.

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:58.551
It's not poverty, not racism,
not exclusion that are new.

00:05:58.575 --> 00:06:02.093
What is new is how
these realities are hidden

00:06:02.117 --> 00:06:03.745
and how people are made invisible

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:07.865
in an age of global and overwhelming
communication and exchange.

00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:11.430
Such makeshift settlements
are considered illegal,

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:14.726
and therefore those living in them
don't have a chance

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.551
of making their voices heard.

00:06:16.575 --> 00:06:22.001
On the contrary, every time they appear,
every time they risk becoming visible,

00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:24.735
merely gives grounds
for further persecution,

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.768
expulsion and suppression.

00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:31.996
What interested us was how we could
come to know this hidden side.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.409
We were searching for an interface
and we found one.

00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:39.696
It's not a digital interface,
but a physical one: it's a hotel.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.235
We named the project "Hotel Gelem."

00:06:42.783 --> 00:06:46.616
Together with Roma families,
we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.599
for example, in Freiburg in Germany,
in Montreuil near Paris,

00:06:49.623 --> 00:06:51.275
and also in the Balkans.

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:52.660
These are real hotels.

00:06:52.684 --> 00:06:54.275
People can stay there.

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:56.275
But they aren't a commercial enterprise.

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:57.781
They are a symbol.

00:06:58.575 --> 00:07:02.227
You can go online and ask
for a personal invitation

00:07:02.251 --> 00:07:06.637
to come and live for a few days
in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes,

00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:10.153
eating, working and living
with the Roma families.

00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:13.915
Here, the Roma families
are not the travelers;

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:15.234
the visitors are.

00:07:15.584 --> 00:07:18.639
Here, the Roma families
are not a minority;

00:07:18.663 --> 00:07:19.957
the visitors are.

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:25.802
The point is not to make judgments,

00:07:25.826 --> 00:07:28.580
but rather to find out
about the context that determines

00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:31.803
these disparate and seemingly
insurmountable contradictions.

00:07:32.299 --> 00:07:34.539
In the world of globalization,

00:07:34.563 --> 00:07:37.275
the continents are drifting
closer to each other.

00:07:37.299 --> 00:07:39.823
Cultures, goods and people
are in permanent exchange,

00:07:39.847 --> 00:07:43.101
but at the same time, the gap
between the world of the privileged

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:45.973
and the world of the excluded is growing.

00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:49.275
We were recently in Australia.

00:07:49.299 --> 00:07:51.900
For us, it was no problem
to enter the country.

00:07:51.924 --> 00:07:54.606
We have European passports,
visas and air tickets.

00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:58.761
But asylum seekers who arrive
by boat in Australia

00:07:58.785 --> 00:08:00.821
are deported or taken to prison.

00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:02.774
The interception of the boats

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:05.879
and the disappearance of the people
into the detention system

00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:08.546
are veiled by the Australian authorities.

00:08:09.062 --> 00:08:13.006
These procedures are declared
to be secret military operations.

00:08:13.768 --> 00:08:16.912
After dramatic escapes
from crisis zones and war zones,

00:08:16.936 --> 00:08:21.047
men, women and children
are detained by Australia without trial,

00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:23.044
sometimes for years.

00:08:25.036 --> 00:08:27.132
During our stay, however,

00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:31.275
we managed to reach out and work
with asylum seekers who were imprisoned,

00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:33.501
despite strict screening and isolation.

00:08:34.057 --> 00:08:38.166
From these contexts was born
an installation in the art space

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.275
of the Queensland University
of Technology in Brisbane.

00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:45.690
On the face of it,
it was a very simple installation.

00:08:46.182 --> 00:08:49.587
On the floor, a stylized compass
gave the direction

00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:51.619
to each immigration detention center,

00:08:51.643 --> 00:08:56.275
accompanied by the distance
and the name of the immigration facility.

00:08:56.299 --> 00:09:00.275
But the exhibition step
came in the form of connectivity.

00:09:00.642 --> 00:09:04.275
Above every floor marking,
there was a headset.

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:08.915
Visitors were offered the opportunity
to talk directly to a refugee

00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:11.275
who was or had been imprisoned

00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:13.487
in a specific detention facility

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.932
and engage in a personal conversation.

00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:19.782
In the protected context
of the art exhibition,

00:09:19.806 --> 00:09:22.433
asylum seekers felt free
to talk about themselves,

00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:26.147
their story and their situation,
without fear of consequences.

00:09:26.694 --> 00:09:29.706
Visitors immersed themselves
in long conversations

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.483
about families torn apart,
about dramatic escapes from war zones,

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:35.119
about suicide attempts,

00:09:35.143 --> 00:09:37.753
about the fate of children in detention.

00:09:38.618 --> 00:09:40.602
Emotions ran deep. Many wept.

00:09:40.626 --> 00:09:43.008
Several revisited the exhibition.

00:09:43.032 --> 00:09:45.372
It was a powerful experience.

00:09:46.459 --> 00:09:50.731
Europe is now facing a stream of migrants.

00:09:51.413 --> 00:09:55.275
The situation for the asylum seekers
is made worse by contradictory policies

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:58.594
and the temptation
of militarized responses.

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:01.989
We have also established
communication systems

00:10:02.013 --> 00:10:05.081
in remote refugee centers
in Switzerland and Greece.

00:10:05.622 --> 00:10:08.853
They are all about providing
basic information -- weather forecasts,

00:10:08.877 --> 00:10:10.751
legal information, guidance.

00:10:11.163 --> 00:10:12.854
But they are significant.

00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:14.529
Information on the Internet

00:10:14.553 --> 00:10:17.283
that could ensure survival
along dangerous routes

00:10:17.307 --> 00:10:18.700
is being censored,

00:10:18.724 --> 00:10:23.411
and the provision of such information
is becoming increasingly criminalized.

00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:27.651
This brings us back to our network
and to the antennas

00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:29.905
on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:32.003
and the "Can You Hear Me?" project.

00:10:32.725 --> 00:10:35.935
We should not take it for granted
to be boundlessly connected.

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:37.992
We should start making
our own connections,

00:10:38.016 --> 00:10:42.516
fighting for this idea of an equal
and globally interconnected world.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.275
This is essential to overcome
our speechlessness

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:48.419
and the separation provoked
by rival political forces.

00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:52.030
It is only in truly exposing ourselves

00:10:52.054 --> 00:10:54.920
to the transformative power
of this experience

00:10:54.944 --> 00:10:58.275
that we can overcome
prejudice and exclusion.

00:10:58.299 --> 00:10:59.453
Thank you.

00:10:59.477 --> 00:11:04.811
(Applause)

00:11:04.835 --> 00:11:06.522
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Mathias.

00:11:06.546 --> 00:11:08.871
The other half of your
artistic duo is also here.

00:11:08.895 --> 00:11:10.532
Christoph Wachter, come onstage.

00:11:10.556 --> 00:11:15.914
(Applause)

00:11:15.938 --> 00:11:17.343
First, tell me just a detail:

00:11:17.367 --> 00:11:19.446
the name of the hotel
is not a random name.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.731
Gelem means something specific
in the Roma language.

00:11:22.755 --> 00:11:27.573
Mathias Jud: Yes, "Gelem, Gelem"
is the title of the Romani hymn,

00:11:27.597 --> 00:11:30.275
the official, and it means
"I went a long way."

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.199
BG: That's just to add
the detail to your talk.

00:11:33.223 --> 00:11:35.907
But you two traveled
to the island of Lesbos

00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:38.622
very recently, you're just back
a couple of days ago,

00:11:38.646 --> 00:11:41.054
in Greece, where thousands
of refugees are arriving

00:11:41.078 --> 00:11:43.366
and have been arriving
over the last few months.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.832
What did you see there
and what did you do there?

00:11:45.856 --> 00:11:49.657
Christoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is one
of the Greek islands close to Turkey,

00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:51.076
and during our stay,

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:56.521
many asylum seekers arrived by boat
on overcrowded dinghies,

00:11:56.545 --> 00:12:00.204
and after landing, they were left
completely on their own.

00:12:00.228 --> 00:12:04.019
They are denied many services.

00:12:04.043 --> 00:12:06.537
For example, they are not allowed
to buy a bus ticket

00:12:06.561 --> 00:12:07.966
or to rent a hotel room,

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.676
so many families literally
sleep in the streets.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.336
And we installed networks there
to allow basic communication,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.463
because I think, I believe,

00:12:19.487 --> 00:12:24.926
it's not only that we have to speak
about the refugees,

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.275
I think we need to start talking to them.

00:12:28.655 --> 00:12:32.275
And by doing so, we can realize
that it is about human beings,

00:12:32.299 --> 00:12:35.062
about their lives
and their struggle to survive.

00:12:35.086 --> 00:12:36.996
BG: And allow them to talk as well.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.935
Christoph, thank you for coming to TED.

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:41.977
Mathias, thank you for coming to TED
and sharing your story.

00:12:42.001 --> 00:12:44.132
(Applause)
