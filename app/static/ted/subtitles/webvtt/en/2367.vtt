00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.816
This is one of the most amazing animals
on the face of the Earth.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.936
This is a tapir.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.616
Now this, this is a baby tapir,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.576
the cutest animal offspring
in the animal kingdom.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.976
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.576
By far.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.240
There is no competition here.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.216
I have dedicated
the past 20 years of my life

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.416
to the research and conservation
of tapirs in Brazil,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.136
and it has been absolutely amazing.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.656
But at the moment,
I've been thinking really, really hard

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.096
about the impact of my work.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.216
I've been questioning myself
about the real contributions I have made

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.776
for the conservation
of these animals I love so much.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.656
Am I being effective

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.656
in safeguarding their survival?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.016
Am I doing enough?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.336
I guess the big question here is,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.736
am I studying tapirs
and contributing to their conservation,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.200
or am I just documenting their extinction?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.696
The world is facing
so many different conservation crises.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.056
We all know that.
It's all over the news every day.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.376
Tropical forests and other ecosystems
are being destroyed,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.656
climate change, so many species
on the brink of extinction:

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.280
tigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.936
This is the lowland tapir,
the tapir species I work with,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.096
the largest terrestrial mammal
of South America.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.656
They're massive. They're powerful.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.216
Adults can weigh up to 300 kilos.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.336
That's half the size of a horse.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.176
They're gorgeous.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.096
Tapirs are mostly found
in tropical forests such as the Amazon,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.576
and they absolutely need
large patches of habitat

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.136
in order to find all the resources
they need to reproduce and survive.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.096
But their habitat is being destroyed,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.616
and they have been hunted out of several
parts of their geographic distribution.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.376
And you see, this is
very, very unfortunate

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.776
because tapirs are extremely important
for the habitats where they are found.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.176
They're herbivores.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.536
Fifty percent of their diet
consists of fruit,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.456
and when they eat the fruit,
they swallow the seeds,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.096
which they disperse throughout
the habitat through their feces.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.656
They play this major role
in shaping and maintaining

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.136
the structure and diversity of the forest,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.296
and for that reason, tapirs are known
as gardeners of the forest.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.056
Isn't that amazing?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.896
If you think about it,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.976
the extinction of tapirs
would seriously affect

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.896
biodiversity as a whole.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.816
I started my tapir work in 1996,
still very young, fresh out of college,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.176
and it was a pioneer research
and conservation program.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.536
At that point, we had nearly
zero information about tapirs,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.856
mostly because they're
so difficult to study.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.416
They're nocturnal, solitary,
very elusive animals,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.616
and we got started getting
very basic data about these animals.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.496
But what is it
that a conservationist does?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.776
Well, first, we need data.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.376
We need field research.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.016
We need those long-term datasets
to support conservation action,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.056
and I told you tapirs
are very hard to study,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.016
so we have to rely
on indirect methods to study them.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.736
We have to capture and anesthetize them

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.216
so that we can install GPS collars
around their necks

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.896
and follow their movements,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.336
which is a technique used by many
other conservationists around the world.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.296
And then we can gather information
about how they use space,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.376
how they move through the landscape,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.376
what are their priority habitats,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.456
and so much more.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.416
Next, we must disseminate what we learn.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.136
We have to educate people about tapirs

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.776
and how important these animals are.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.416
And it's amazing
how many people around the world

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.256
do not know what a tapir is.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.480
In fact, many people think
this is a tapir.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.416
Let me tell you, this is not a tapir.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.856
(Laughter)

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.816
This is a giant anteater.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.360
Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.176
And then next we have to provide
training, capacity building.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.656
It is our responsibility to prepare
the conservationists of the future.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.736
We are losing several
conservation battles,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.216
and we need more people doing what we do,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.616
and they need the skills,
and they need the passion to do that.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.176
Ultimately, we conservationists,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.816
we must be able to apply our data,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.056
to apply our accumulated knowledge

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.016
to support actual conservation action.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.016
Our first tapir program

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.296
took place in the Atlantic Forest

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.456
in the eastern part of Brazil,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.856
one of the most threatened
biomes in the world.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.056
The destruction of the Atlantic Forest

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.296
began in the early 1500s,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.096
when the Portuguese
first arrived in Brazil,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.536
beginning European colonization
in the eastern part of South America.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.856
This forest was almost completely cleared

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.096
for timber, agriculture, cattle ranching
and the construction of cities,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.576
and today only seven percent
of the Atlantic forest

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.776
is still left standing.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.176
And tapirs are found in very, very small,
isolated, disconnected populations.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.856
In the Atlantic Forest, we found out
that tapirs move through open areas

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.216
of pastureland and agriculture

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.456
going from one patch of forest
to patch of forest.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.016
So our main approach in this region

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.416
was to use our tapir data
to identify the potential places

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.416
for the establishment
of wildlife corridors

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.096
in between those patches of forest,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.176
reconnecting the habitat

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.936
so that tapirs and many other animals
could cross the landscape safely.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.696
After 12 years in the Atlantic Forest,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.736
in 2008, we expanded our tapir
conservation efforts to the Pantanal

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.736
in the western part of Brazil

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.136
near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.576
This is the largest continuous
freshwater floodplain in the world,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.056
an incredible place

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.736
and one of the most important strongholds
for lowland tapirs in South America.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.256
And working in the Pantanal
has been extremely refreshing

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.256
because we found large,
healthy tapir populations in the area,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.216
and we have been able to study tapirs

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.976
in the most natural conditions
we'll ever find,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.840
very much free of threats.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.976
In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars,
we are using another technique:

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.216
camera traps.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.136
This camera is equipped
with a movement sensor

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.176
and it photographs animals
when they walk in front of it.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.656
So thanks to these amazing devices,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.896
we have been able
to gather precious information

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.856
about tapir reproduction
and social organization

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.416
which are very important
pieces of the puzzle

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.536
when you're trying to develop
those conservation strategies.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.256
And right now, 2015,
we are expanding our work once again

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.136
to the Brazilian Cerrado,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.336
the open grasslands and shrub forests
in the central part of Brazil.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:41.256
Today this region is the very epicenter
of economic development in my country,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.976
where natural habitat
and wildlife populations

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.096
are rapidly being eradicated
by several different threats,

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.696
including once again cattle ranching,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.456
large sugarcane and soybean plantations,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.976
poaching, roadkill, just to name a few.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.616
And somehow, tapirs are still there,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.056
which gives me a lot of hope.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.576
But I have to say that starting
this new program in the Cerrado

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.456
was a bit of a slap in the face.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.936
When you drive around

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.776
and you find dead tapirs
along the highways

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.816
and signs of tapirs wandering around
in the middle of sugarcane plantations

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.856
where they shouldn't be,

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.096
and you talk to kids and they tell you
that they know how tapir meat tastes

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.496
because their families poach and eat them,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.760
it really breaks your heart.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.256
The situation in the Cerrado
made me realize --

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.216
it gave me the sense of urgency.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.535
I am swimming against the tide.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:46.216
It made me realize that despite
two decades of hard work

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.776
trying to save these animals,
we still have so much work to do

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.856
if we are to prevent them
from disappearing.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.816
We have to find ways
to solve all these problems.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.696
We really do, and you know what?

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.136
We really came to a point
in the conservation world

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.896
where we have to think out of the box.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.656
We'll have to be a lot more creative
than we are right now.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.576
And I told you, roadkill is a big problem
for tapirs in the Cerrado,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.016
so we just came up with the idea
of putting reflective stickers

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.856
on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.216
These are the same stickers
used on big trucks

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.856
to avoid collision.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.096
Tapirs cross the highways after dark,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.296
so the stickers will hopefully
help drivers see this shining thing

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.736
crossing the highway,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.296
and maybe they will
slow down a little bit.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.896
For now, this is just a crazy idea.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.576
We don't know. We'll see if it will
reduce the amount of tapir roadkill.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.600
But the point is, maybe this is
the kind of stuff that needs to be done.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.656
And although I'm struggling
with all these questions

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.456
in my mind right now,

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.376
I have a pact with tapirs.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.136
I know in my heart

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.096
that tapir conservation is my cause.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.816
This is my passion.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.376
I am not alone.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.136
I have this huge network
of supporters behind me,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.176
and there is no way
I'm ever going to stop.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.576
I will continue doing this,
most probably for the rest of my life.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.896
And I'll keep doing this
for Patrícia, my namesake,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.696
one of the first tapirs we captured
and monitored in the Atlantic Forest

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.816
many, many years ago;

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.376
for Rita and her baby Vincent
in the Pantanal.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.496
And I'll keep doing this for Ted,
a baby tapir we captured

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.936
in December last year
also in the Pantanal.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.056
And I will keep doing this

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.736
for the hundreds of tapirs
that I've had the pleasure to meet

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.976
over the years

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.536
and the many others I know
I will encounter in the future.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.896
These animals deserve to be cared for.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.896
They need me. They need us.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.896
And you know? We human beings
deserve to live in a world

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.816
where we can get out there
and see and benefit from

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.496
not only tapirs

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.336
but all the other beautiful species,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.176
now and in the future.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.296
Thank you so much.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.720
