WEBVTT

00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.024
I would like to demonstrate
for the first time in public

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:08.119
that it is possible to transmit a video

00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:12.452
from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:17.636
to a solar cell with a laptop
acting as a receiver.

00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:21.069
There is no Wi-Fi involved,
it's just light.

00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:23.927
And you may wonder, what's the point?

00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:25.695
And the point is this:

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.075
There will be a massive
extension of the Internet

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.909
to close the digital divide,

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:36.114
and also to allow for what we call
"The Internet of Things" --

00:00:36.138 --> 00:00:39.304
tens of billions of devices
connected to the Internet.

00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:43.359
In my view, such an extension
of the Internet can only work

00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:45.730
if it's almost energy-neutral.

00:00:46.173 --> 00:00:51.005
This means we need to use existing
infrastructure as much as possible.

00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:56.434
And this is where the solar cell
and the LED come in.

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.277
I demonstrated for the first time,

00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:01.266
at TED in 2011,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.274
Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity.

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:09.776
Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs
to transmit data incredibly fast,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.092
and also in a safe and secure manner.

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:16.283
Data is transported by the light,

00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:19.432
encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.954
If we look around,
we have many LEDs around us,

00:01:23.978 --> 00:01:28.639
so there's a rich infrastructure
of Li-Fi transmitters around us.

00:01:29.393 --> 00:01:34.632
But so far, we have been using
special devices -- small photo detectors,

00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:38.338
to receive the information
encoded in the data.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.832
I wanted to find a way to also use
existing infrastructure

00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:45.862
to receive data from our Li-Fi lights.

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:50.540
And this is why I have been looking into
solar cells and solar panels.

00:01:51.016 --> 00:01:56.144
A solar cell absorbs light
and converts it into electrical energy.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.535
This is why we can use a solar cell
to charge our mobile phone.

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:02.965
But now we need to remember

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:09.220
that the data is encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness of the LED,

00:02:09.244 --> 00:02:12.593
so if the incoming light fluctuates,

00:02:12.617 --> 00:02:15.548
so does the energy harvested
from the solar cell.

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.088
This means we have
a principal mechanism in place

00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:26.222
to receive information from the light
and by the solar cell,

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:29.021
because the fluctuations
of the energy harvested

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:31.163
correspond to the data transmitted.

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:34.060
Of course the question is:

00:02:34.084 --> 00:02:38.244
can we receive very fast and subtle
changes of the brightness,

00:02:38.268 --> 00:02:42.078
such as the ones transmitted
by our LED lights?

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:46.145
And the answer to that is yes, we can.

00:02:46.637 --> 00:02:48.416
We have shown in the lab

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.922
that we can receive up to 50
megabytes per second

00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:54.381
from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.

00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:58.548
And this is faster than most
broadband connections these days.

00:02:59.437 --> 00:03:02.747
Now let me show you in practice.

00:03:05.095 --> 00:03:09.483
In this box is a standard,
off-the-shelf LED lamp.

00:03:11.193 --> 00:03:13.768
This is a standard,
off-the-shelf solar cell;

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.975
it is connected to the laptop.

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.269
And also we have an instrument here

00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:23.071
to visualize the energy
we harvest from the solar cell.

00:03:23.095 --> 00:03:25.893
And this instrument shows
something at the moment.

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:30.198
This is because the solar cell already
harvests light from the ambient light.

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:33.942
Now what I would like to do first
is switch on the light,

00:03:33.966 --> 00:03:36.072
and I'll simply, only switch on the light,

00:03:36.096 --> 00:03:38.204
for a moment,

00:03:38.228 --> 00:03:42.222
and what you'll notice is that
the instrument jumps to the right.

00:03:42.904 --> 00:03:44.594
So the solar cell, for a moment,

00:03:44.618 --> 00:03:48.140
is harvesting energy
from this artificial light source.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.818
If I turn it off, we see it drops.

00:03:51.842 --> 00:03:53.025
I turn it on ...

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.768
So we harvest energy with the solar cell.

00:03:56.586 --> 00:04:01.909
But next I would like to activate
the streaming of the video.

00:04:03.418 --> 00:04:05.742
And I've done this
by pressing this button.

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:10.489
So now this LED lamp here
is streaming a video

00:04:10.513 --> 00:04:14.645
by changing the brightness of the LED
in a very subtle way,

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.167
and in a way that you can't
recognize with your eye,

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.447
because the changes
are too fast to recognize.

00:04:21.384 --> 00:04:23.783
But in order to prove the point,

00:04:23.807 --> 00:04:26.952
I can block the light of the solar cell.

00:04:28.087 --> 00:04:31.310
So first you notice
the energy harvesting drops

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:33.026
and the video stops as well.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.706
If I remove the blockage,
the video will restart.

00:04:37.357 --> 00:04:43.586
(Applause)

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.943
And I can repeat that.

00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:51.218
So we stop the transmission of the video
and energy harvesting stops as well.

00:04:51.242 --> 00:04:55.650
So that is to show that the solar cell
acts as a receiver.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:01.463
But now imagine that this LED lamp
is a street light, and there's fog.

00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:04.409
And so I want to simulate fog,

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:07.176
and that's why I brought
a handkerchief with me.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.632
(Laughter)

00:05:08.656 --> 00:05:12.616
And let me put the handkerchief
over the solar cell.

00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:15.533
First you notice

00:05:15.557 --> 00:05:19.754
the energy harvested drops, as expected,

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:22.356
but now the video still continues.

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:25.388
This means, despite the blockage,

00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:29.293
there's sufficient light coming through
the handkerchief to the solar cell,

00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:34.832
so that the solar cell is able to decode
and stream that information,

00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:37.460
in this case, a high-definition video.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.603
What's really important here is that
a solar cell has become a receiver

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:48.442
for high-speed wireless signals
encoded in light,

00:05:48.466 --> 00:05:53.282
while it maintains its primary function
as an energy-harvesting device.

00:05:53.872 --> 00:05:56.291
That's why it is possible

00:05:56.315 --> 00:06:00.172
to use existing solar cells
on the roof of a hut

00:06:00.196 --> 00:06:02.689
to act as a broadband receiver

00:06:02.713 --> 00:06:07.089
from a laser station on a close by hill,
or indeed, lamp post.

00:06:07.605 --> 00:06:11.300
And It really doesn't matter
where the beam hits the solar cell.

00:06:11.647 --> 00:06:12.825
And the same is true

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.642
for translucent solar cells
integrated into windows,

00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:20.198
solar cells integrated
into street furniture,

00:06:20.222 --> 00:06:24.765
or indeed, solar cells integrated
into these billions of devices

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.865
that will form the Internet of Things.

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.047
Because simply,

00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.562
we don't want to charge
these devices regularly,

00:06:30.586 --> 00:06:33.561
or worse, replace the batteries
every few months.

00:06:34.418 --> 00:06:36.148
As I said to you,

00:06:36.172 --> 00:06:38.490
this is the first time
I've shown this in public.

00:06:38.514 --> 00:06:40.569
It's very much a lab demonstration,

00:06:40.593 --> 00:06:41.796
a prototype.

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:45.570
But my team and I are confident
that we can take this to market

00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:47.585
within the next two to three years.

00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:53.544
And we hope we will be able to contribute
to closing the digital divide,

00:06:53.568 --> 00:06:54.766
and also contribute

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.735
to connecting all these billions
of devices to the Internet.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.895
And all of this without causing

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.371
a massive explosion
of energy consumption --

00:07:02.395 --> 00:07:04.617
because of the solar cells,
quite the opposite.

00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:05.794
Thank you.

00:07:05.818 --> 00:07:11.000
(Applause)
