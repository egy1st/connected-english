00:00:01.087 --> 00:00:03.580
So whenever I visit a school
and talk to students,

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:05.747
I always ask them the same thing:

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:08.188
Why do you Google?

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:12.021
Why is Google the search engine
of choice for you?

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.407
Strangely enough, I always get
the same three answers.

00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:17.470
One, "Because it works,"

00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:20.400
which is a great answer;
that's why I Google, too.

00:00:20.424 --> 00:00:22.457
Two, somebody will say,

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:25.121
"I really don't know of any alternatives."

00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:28.836
It's not an equally great answer
and my reply to that is usually,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.781
"Try to Google the word 'search engine,'

00:00:30.805 --> 00:00:33.207
you may find a couple
of interesting alternatives."

00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:35.326
And last but not least, thirdly,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.660
inevitably, one student will raise
her or his hand and say,

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:43.867
"With Google, I'm certain to always get
the best, unbiased search result."

00:00:45.157 --> 00:00:51.663
Certain to always get the best,
unbiased search result.

00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:55.481
Now, as a man of the humanities,

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:57.686
albeit a digital humanities man,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.448
that just makes my skin curl,

00:00:59.472 --> 00:01:04.358
even if I, too, realize that that trust,
that idea of the unbiased search result

00:01:04.382 --> 00:01:08.237
is a cornerstone in our collective love
for and appreciation of Google.

00:01:08.658 --> 00:01:12.916
I will show you why that, philosophically,
is almost an impossibility.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.194
But let me first elaborate,
just a little bit, on a basic principle

00:01:16.218 --> 00:01:19.331
behind each search query
that we sometimes seem to forget.

00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:21.931
So whenever you set out
to Google something,

00:01:21.955 --> 00:01:25.882
start by asking yourself this:
"Am I looking for an isolated fact?"

00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:29.495
What is the capital of France?

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:31.944
What are the building blocks
of a water molecule?

00:01:31.968 --> 00:01:34.309
Great -- Google away.

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.453
There's not a group of scientists
who are this close to proving

00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:39.474
that it's actually London and H30.

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.869
You don't see a big conspiracy
among those things.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.426
We agree, on a global scale,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.175
what the answers are
to these isolated facts.

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:51.501
But if you complicate your question
just a little bit and ask something like,

00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:54.208
"Why is there
an Israeli-Palestine conflict?"

00:01:54.978 --> 00:01:57.618
You're not exactly looking
for a singular fact anymore,

00:01:57.642 --> 00:01:59.475
you're looking for knowledge,

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.077
which is something way more
complicated and delicate.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.149
And to get to knowledge,

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:07.204
you have to bring 10 or 20
or 100 facts to the table

00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:10.204
and acknowledge them and say,
"Yes, these are all true."

00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:11.902
But because of who I am,

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:14.196
young or old, black or white,
gay or straight,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.831
I will value them differently.

00:02:15.855 --> 00:02:17.543
And I will say, "Yes, this is true,

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.681
but this is more important
to me than that."

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:21.695
And this is where it becomes interesting,

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.865
because this is where we become human.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.885
This is when we start
to argue, to form society.

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.266
And to really get somewhere,
we need to filter all our facts here,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.846
through friends and neighbors
and parents and children

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.902
and coworkers and newspapers
and magazines,

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:38.006
to finally be grounded in real knowledge,

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.077
which is something that a search engine
is a poor help to achieve.

00:02:43.284 --> 00:02:49.612
So, I promised you an example
just to show you why it's so hard

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:53.040
to get to the point of true, clean,
objective knowledge --

00:02:53.064 --> 00:02:54.532
as food for thought.

00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:58.449
I will conduct a couple of simple
queries, search queries.

00:02:58.473 --> 00:03:02.513
We'll start with "Michelle Obama,"

00:03:02.537 --> 00:03:04.341
the First Lady of the United States.

00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:06.094
And we'll click for pictures.

00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:09.279
It works really well, as you can see.

00:03:09.303 --> 00:03:12.331
It's a perfect search
result, more or less.

00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:15.105
It's just her in the picture,
not even the President.

00:03:15.664 --> 00:03:16.977
How does this work?

00:03:17.837 --> 00:03:19.209
Quite simple.

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.448
Google uses a lot of smartness
to achieve this, but quite simply,

00:03:22.472 --> 00:03:24.532
they look at two things
more than anything.

00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:29.712
First, what does it say in the caption
under the picture on each website?

00:03:29.736 --> 00:03:31.951
Does it say "Michelle Obama"
under the picture?

00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:34.331
Pretty good indication
it's actually her on there.

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:36.741
Second, Google looks at the picture file,

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:39.797
the name of the file as such
uploaded to the website.

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.490
Again, is it called "MichelleObama.jpeg"?

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.761
Pretty good indication it's not
Clint Eastwood in the picture.

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:50.050
So, you've got those two and you get
a search result like this -- almost.

00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:56.677
Now, in 2009, Michelle Obama
was the victim of a racist campaign,

00:03:56.701 --> 00:04:00.716
where people set out to insult her
through her search results.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.132
There was a picture distributed
widely over the Internet

00:04:04.156 --> 00:04:06.800
where her face was distorted
to look like a monkey.

00:04:06.824 --> 00:04:09.993
And that picture was published all over.

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:13.778
And people published it
very, very purposefully,

00:04:13.802 --> 00:04:15.773
to get it up there in the search results.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.752
They made sure to write
"Michelle Obama" in the caption

00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:22.953
and they made sure to upload the picture
as "MichelleObama.jpeg," or the like.

00:04:22.977 --> 00:04:25.344
You get why -- to manipulate
the search result.

00:04:25.368 --> 00:04:26.663
And it worked, too.

00:04:26.687 --> 00:04:29.407
So when you picture-Googled
for "Michelle Obama" in 2009,

00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:32.818
that distorted monkey picture
showed up among the first results.

00:04:32.842 --> 00:04:36.408
Now, the results are self-cleansing,

00:04:36.432 --> 00:04:38.185
and that's sort of the beauty of it,

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:41.612
because Google measures relevance
every hour, every day.

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:44.350
However, Google didn't settle
for that this time,

00:04:44.374 --> 00:04:47.498
they just thought, "That's racist
and it's a bad search result

00:04:47.522 --> 00:04:50.657
and we're going to go back
and clean that up manually.

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.613
We are going to write
some code and fix it,"

00:04:53.637 --> 00:04:54.884
which they did.

00:04:55.454 --> 00:04:59.196
And I don't think anyone in this room
thinks that was a bad idea.

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:00.953
Me neither.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.834
But then, a couple of years go by,

00:05:05.858 --> 00:05:08.842
and the world's most-Googled Anders,

00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:11.145
Anders Behring Breivik,

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.875
did what he did.

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:14.900
This is July 22 in 2011,

00:05:14.924 --> 00:05:17.573
and a terrible day in Norwegian history.

00:05:17.597 --> 00:05:21.384
This man, a terrorist, blew up
a couple of government buildings

00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:24.291
walking distance from where we are
right now in Oslo, Norway

00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:26.366
and then he traveled
to the island of UtÃ¸ya

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.613
and shot and killed a group of kids.

00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:30.841
Almost 80 people died that day.

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:36.956
And a lot of people would describe
this act of terror as two steps,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.391
that he did two things: he blew up
the buildings and he shot those kids.

00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:41.580
It's not true.

00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:44.469
It was three steps.

00:05:44.493 --> 00:05:46.707
He blew up those buildings,
he shot those kids,

00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:50.375
and he sat down and waited
for the world to Google him.

00:05:51.227 --> 00:05:53.854
And he prepared
all three steps equally well.

00:05:54.544 --> 00:05:57.334
And if there was somebody
who immediately understood this,

00:05:57.358 --> 00:05:58.882
it was a Swedish web developer,

00:05:58.906 --> 00:06:02.529
a search engine optimization expert
in Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist.

00:06:02.553 --> 00:06:04.141
He's also a very political guy

00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:07.441
and he was right out there
in social media, on his blog and Facebook.

00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:08.671
And he told everybody,

00:06:08.695 --> 00:06:11.150
"If there's something that
this guy wants right now,

00:06:11.174 --> 00:06:13.633
it's to control the image of himself.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.720
Let's see if we can distort that.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.467
Let's see if we, in the civilized world,
can protest against what he did

00:06:21.491 --> 00:06:24.808
through insulting him
in his search results."

00:06:24.832 --> 00:06:26.019
And how?

00:06:26.797 --> 00:06:28.853
He told all of his readers the following,

00:06:28.877 --> 00:06:30.741
"Go out there on the Internet,

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.660
find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:36.882
find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --

00:06:36.906 --> 00:06:40.376
publish them in your feeds,
on your websites, on your blogs.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.321
Make sure to write the terrorist's
name in the caption,

00:06:43.345 --> 00:06:47.832
make sure to name
the picture file "Breivik.jpeg."

00:06:47.856 --> 00:06:51.657
Let's teach Google that that's
the face of the terrorist."

00:06:53.552 --> 00:06:54.830
And it worked.

00:06:55.853 --> 00:06:58.751
Two years after that campaign
against Michelle Obama,

00:06:58.775 --> 00:07:02.041
this manipulation campaign
against Anders Behring Breivik worked.

00:07:02.065 --> 00:07:06.527
If you picture-Googled for him weeks after
the July 22 events from Sweden,

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:10.878
you'd see that picture of dog poop
high up in the search results,

00:07:10.902 --> 00:07:12.346
as a little protest.

00:07:13.425 --> 00:07:17.557
Strangely enough, Google
didn't intervene this time.

00:07:18.494 --> 00:07:22.766
They did not step in and manually
clean those search results up.

00:07:23.964 --> 00:07:25.680
So the million-dollar question,

00:07:25.704 --> 00:07:29.072
is there anything different
between these two happenings here?

00:07:29.096 --> 00:07:32.289
Is there anything different between
what happened to Michelle Obama

00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:34.378
and what happened
to Anders Behring Breivik?

00:07:34.402 --> 00:07:35.686
Of course not.

00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:38.332
It's the exact same thing,

00:07:38.356 --> 00:07:41.220
yet Google intervened in one case
and not in the other.

00:07:41.244 --> 00:07:42.497
Why?

00:07:43.283 --> 00:07:46.583
Because Michelle Obama
is an honorable person, that's why,

00:07:46.607 --> 00:07:49.523
and Anders Behring Breivik
is a despicable person.

00:07:50.142 --> 00:07:51.677
See what happens there?

00:07:51.701 --> 00:07:54.956
An evaluation of a person takes place

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.766
and there's only one
power-player in the world

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.270
with the authority to say who's who.

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:03.623
"We like you, we dislike you.

00:08:03.647 --> 00:08:05.686
We believe in you,
we don't believe in you.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.257
You're right, you're wrong.
You're true, you're false.

00:08:08.281 --> 00:08:10.086
You're Obama, and you're Breivik."

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.791
That's power if I ever saw it.

00:08:15.206 --> 00:08:18.858
So I'm asking you to remember
that behind every algorithm

00:08:18.882 --> 00:08:20.659
is always a person,

00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:23.178
a person with a set of personal beliefs

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:25.727
that no code can ever
completely eradicate.

00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:28.185
And my message goes
out not only to Google,

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:31.019
but to all believers in the faith
of code around the world.

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:34.019
You need to identify
your own personal bias.

00:08:34.043 --> 00:08:36.056
You need to understand that you are human

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.571
and take responsibility accordingly.

00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:42.829
And I say this because I believe
we've reached a point in time

00:08:42.853 --> 00:08:44.408
when it's absolutely imperative

00:08:44.432 --> 00:08:47.649
that we tie those bonds
together again, tighter:

00:08:47.673 --> 00:08:50.041
the humanities and the technology.

00:08:50.483 --> 00:08:52.288
Tighter than ever.

00:08:52.312 --> 00:08:55.651
And, if nothing else, to remind us
that that wonderfully seductive idea

00:08:55.675 --> 00:08:58.343
of the unbiased, clean search result

00:08:58.367 --> 00:09:01.134
is, and is likely to remain, a myth.

00:09:01.984 --> 00:09:03.143
Thank you for your time.

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:05.599
(Applause)
