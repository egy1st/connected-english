00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm honored by the invitation, and thanks.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
won't interest many other people.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I would love to talk about my astronomy,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in non-gray atmospheres

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So I'm not going to talk about that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It would be just as much fun

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I caught the guys,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and stealing information and selling it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And I'd love to talk about that -- and it'd be fun --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but, 20 years later ...

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I find computer security, frankly, to be kind of boring.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's tedious.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The first time you do something, it's science.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The second time, it's engineering.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
A third time, it's just being a technician.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm a scientist. Once I do something, I do something else.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So, I'm not going to talk about that.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
"Silicon Snake Oil," or my second book,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
nor am I going to talk about

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
why I believe computers don't belong in schools.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I feel that there's a massive and bizarre idea going around

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that we have to bring more computers into schools.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
My idea is: no! No!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Get them out of schools, and keep them out of schools.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And I'd love to talk about this,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that it doesn't need much talking about --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
but I guess I may be very wrong about that,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and everything else that I've said.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So don't go back and read my dissertation.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It probably has lies in it as well.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Having said that, I outlined my talk about five minutes ago.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
(Laughter)

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And if you look at it over here,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Oh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
because I've got gray hair,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
In fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
if you really want to know about the future,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
don't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
No! Don't ask somebody who's writing code.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
No, if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
ask a kindergarten teacher.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
They know.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
In fact, don't ask just any kindergarten teacher,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
ask an experienced one.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
They're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I don't. Nor, I suspect,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Certainly, all of us can imagine these cool new things

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that are going to be there.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But to me, things aren't the future.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
What I ask myself is, what's society is going to be like,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and spend a huge amount of on-screen time,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but have never gone bowling together?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Change is happening, and the change that is happening

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
is not one that is in software.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But that's not what I'm going to talk about.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I'd love to talk about it, it'd be fun,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
but I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Oh -- the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
is right over here. Right over here.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Is that visible? What I'd like to talk about is one-sided things.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I would dearly love to talk about

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
things that have one side.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Because I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
but I'm one of the very few people,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
if not the only person in the world, that makes Klein bottles.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Right away, I hope that all of your eyes glaze over.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
This is a Klein bottle.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
For those of you in the audience who know,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
you roll your eyes and say, yup, I know all about it.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
It has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
It has wonderful properties.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
you get one of these, and I make them out of glass.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And I'd love to talk to you about this,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
but I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
(Laughter)

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
(Chris Anderson: I've got a cold.)

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
However, the "D" in TED of course stands for design.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Just two weeks ago I made --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
you know, I've been making small, medium and big Klein bottles for the trade.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But what I've just made --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and I'm delighted to show you, first time in public here.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
This is a Klein bottle wine bottle,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
which, although in four dimensions

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
it shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
it's perfectly capable of doing so

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
because our universe has only three spatial dimensions.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
it can hold fluids.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So it's highly -- that one's the cool one.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
That was a month of my life.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
But although I would love to talk about topology with you, I'm not going to.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
(Laughter)

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Instead, I'm going to mention my mom,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
who passed away last summer.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Had collected photographs of me, as mothers will do.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Could somebody put this guy up?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And I looked over her album

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and she had collected a picture of me, standing --

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
well, sitting -- in 1969, in front of a bunch of dials.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And I looked at it, and said, oh my god,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
that was me, when I was working at the electronic music studio!

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
As a technician, repairing and maintaining

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow!

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Way back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And it sent me back.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Soon after that, I found in another picture that she had, a picture of me.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
This guy over here of course is me.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
This man is Robert Moog,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
the inventor of the Moog synthesizer,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
who passed away this past August.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Robert Moog was a generous, kind person, extraordinarily competent engineer.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
A musician who took time from his life to teach me,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
a sophomore, a freshman at SUNY Buffalo.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
not just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
We're studying physics, I'm studying physics,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and he's saying, "That's a good thing to do.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Don't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics."

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Mentoring me. He'd come up and

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
spend hours and hours with me.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
In the background, my bicycle.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
to show Greg Flint and I things about this.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
We sat around talking about Fourier transforms,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Bessel functions, modulation transfer functions,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
stuff like this.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Bob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Anyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
(Applause)

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Oh, cool. I can get to this place over here, right?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about -- is that okay?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
It says kids over here, that's what I'd like to talk about.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I've decided that, for me at least,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I don't have a big enough head.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So I think locally and I act locally.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very, very locally.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So Ph.D. this, and degree there, and the yadda yadda.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I was talking about this stuff to

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
some schoolteachers about a year ago.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And one of them, several of them would come up to me and say,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
"Well, how come you ain't teaching?"

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And I said, "Well, I've taught graduate --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
I've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes."

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
No, they said, "If you're so into kids and all this stuff,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
how come you ain't over here on the front lines?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Put your money where you mouth is."

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Is true. Is true. I teach eighth-grade science four days a week.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Not just showing up every now and then.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
No, no, no, no, no. I take attendance.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I take lunch hour. (Applause)

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
This is not -- no, no, no, this is not claps.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Not just show up to class every now and then.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Teach a solid week. Okay, I'm teaching three-quarters time, but good enough.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
One of the things that I've done for my science students

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
is to tell them, "Look, I'm going to teach you college-level physics.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
No calculus, I'll cut out that.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
You won't need to know trig.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and we're going to do serious experiments.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
We're going to be doing genuine physics."

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
(High-pitched tone)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Oh, before I even turn that on,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
this is through the lens, and one of the things we used a lens for

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
was to measure the speed of light.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
My students in El Cerrito -- with my help, of course,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope --

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
measured the speed of light.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
We were off by 25 percent. How many eighth graders do you know of

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
who have measured the speed of light?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
In addition to that, we've measured the speed of sound.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I'd love to measure the speed of light here.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I was all set to do it and I was thinking, "Aw man,"

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I was just going to impose upon the powers that be,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and measure the speed of light.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
but then it turns out that to set up here, you have like 10 minutes to set up!

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And there's no time to do it.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So, next time, maybe, I'll measure the speed of light!

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
But meanwhile, let's measure the speed of sound!

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Well, the obvious way to measure the speed of sound

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
But, probably -- one of my students, Ariel [unclear], said,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
"Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation?"

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And all of you know the wave equation is

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
is a constant. When the frequency goes up,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
the wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
frequency goes down. So, if we have a wave here --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
over here, that's what's interesting --

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
as the pitch goes up, things get closer,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
pitch goes down, things stretch out.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Right? This is simple physics.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
All of you know this from eighth grade, remember?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
What they didn't tell you in physics -- in eighth-grade physics --

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
but they should have, and I wish they had,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
or light, you get a constant.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And that constant is the speed of sound.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So, in order to measure the speed of sound,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I've got a frequency counter right here.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Set it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Now, so I know the frequency.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It's 1.76 kilohertz. I measure its wavelength.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
All I need now is to flip on another beam,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and the bottom beam is me talking, right?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I'll put it over here, and as I move this away from the source,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
you'll notice the spiral.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
The slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
coming out this way.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Those of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
but bear with me. (Laughter)

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
To measure the wavelength,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
all I need to do is measure the distance from here --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
one full wave -- over to here.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
From here to here is the wavelength of sound.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So, I'll put a measuring tape here, measuring tape here, move it back over to here.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I've moved the microphone 20 centimeters.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
0.2 meters from here, back to here, 20 centimeters.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
OK, let's go back to Mr. Elmo.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
The wavelength was 0.2 meters.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Let's figure out what this is.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000
1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
If you look it up in the book, it's really 343.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
But, here with kludgy material, and lousy drink --

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
we've been able to measure the speed of sound to --

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
not bad. Pretty good.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
All of which comes to what I wanted to say.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Go back to this picture of me a million years ago.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
It was 1971, the Vietnam War was going on,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and I'm like, "Oh my God!"

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I'm studying physics: Landau, Lipschitz, Resnick and Halliday.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:15.000
There's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
There's a riot going on on campus,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and the police are chasing me, right?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
"You! You're a student."

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Pulls out a gun. Goes boom!

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
This cop comes after me with a rifle.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
He wants to clunk me over the head!

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!"

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
It's one of these bell-tower buildings.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
The cop's chasing me.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Chasing me up the first floor, second floor, third floor.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Chases me into this room.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
The entranceway to the bell tower.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I slam the door behind me, climb up,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And I'm thinking, "Oh yeah,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
the square root of the length is proportional to its period." (Laughter)

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I keep climbing up, go back.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I go to a place where a dowel splits off.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
There's a clock, clock, clock, clock.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
The time's going backwards because I'm inside of it.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I climb up, and there's this place, way in the back,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
that you climb up this wooden ladder.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I pop up the top, and there's a cupola.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
A dome, one of these ten-foot domes.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
shooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And I'm asking, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?"

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Namely, that when they cast bells,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
they write inscriptions on them.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
So, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I'm asking myself, "Why am I here?"

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
So, at this time, I'd like to tell you the words inscribed

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
upon the Hayes Hall tower bells:

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
"All truth is one.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
In this light, may science and religion endeavor here

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
for the steady evolution of mankind, from darkness to light,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
from narrowness to broad-mindedness, from prejudice to tolerance.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000
It is the voice of life, which calls us to come and learn."

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Thank you very much.
