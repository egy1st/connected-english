WEBVTT

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.856
Jenni Chang: When I told
my parents I was gay,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.056
the first thing they said to me was,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.296
"We're bringing you back to Taiwan."

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.000
(Laughter)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.856
In their minds, my sexual orientation
was America's fault.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.816
The West had corrupted me
with divergent ideas,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.816
and if only my parents
had never left Taiwan,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.296
this would not have happened
to their only daughter.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.416
In truth, I wondered if they were right.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.496
Of course, there are gay people in Asia,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.736
just as there are gay people
in every part of the world.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.696
But is the idea of living an "out" life,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.376
in the "I'm gay, this is my spouse,
and we're proud of our lives together"

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.040
kind of way just a Western idea?

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.856
If I had grown up in Taiwan,
or any place outside of the West,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.936
would I have found models
of happy, thriving LGBT people?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.627
Lisa Dazols: I had similar notions.

00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:55.856
As an HIV social worker in San Francisco,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.856
I had met many gay immigrants.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.056
They told me their stories
of persecution in their home countries,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.576
just for being gay,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.056
and the reasons
why they escaped to the US.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.216
I saw how this had beaten them down.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.256
After 10 years of doing this kind of work,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.736
I needed better stories for myself.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.776
I knew the world was far from perfect,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.120
but surely not every gay story was tragic.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.776
JC: So as a couple, we both had a need
to find stories of hope.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.736
So we set off on a mission
to travel the world

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.616
and look for the people
we finally termed as the "Supergays."

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.840
(Laughter)

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.216
These would be the LGBT individuals

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.576
who were doing something
extraordinary in the world.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.936
They would be courageous, resilient,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.896
and most of all, proud of who they were.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.216
They would be the kind of person
that I aspire to be.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.776
Our plan was to share their stories
to the world through film.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.376
LD: There was just one problem.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.456
We had zero reporting
and zero filmmaking experience.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.496
(Laughter)

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.856
We didn't even know
where to find the Supergays,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.976
so we just had to trust that we'd
figure it all out along the way.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.416
So we picked 15 countries
in Asia, Africa and South America,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.096
countries outside the West
that varied in terms of LGBT rights.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.376
We bought a camcorder,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.543
ordered a book
on how to make a documentary --

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:14.216
(Laughter)

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.776
you can learn a lot these days --

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.000
and set off on an around-the-world trip.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.256
JC: One of the first countries
that we traveled to was Nepal.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.776
Despite widespread poverty,
a decade-long civil war,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.896
and now recently,
a devastating earthquake,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.936
Nepal has made significant strides
in the fight for equality.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.016
One of the key figures
in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.336
A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.536
Bhumika has had to overcome
being expelled from school

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.856
and getting incarcerated
because of her gender presentation.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.976
But, in 2007, Bhumika
and Nepal's LGBT rights organization

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.056
successfully petitioned
the Nepali Supreme Court

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.776
to protect against LGBT discrimination.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.016
Here's Bhumika:

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.776
(Video) BS: What I'm most proud of?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.296
I'm a transgendered person.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.096
I'm so proud of my life.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.856
On December 21, 2007,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.536
the supreme court gave the decision
for the Nepal government

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.296
to give transgender identity cards

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.256
and same-sex marriage.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.576
LD: I can appreciate
Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.496
Something as simple
as using a public restroom

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.056
can be a huge challenge
when you don't fit in

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.136
to people's strict gender expectations.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.856
Traveling throughout Asia,

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.416
I tended to freak out women
in public restrooms.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.856
They weren't used to seeing
someone like me.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.071
I had to come up with a strategy,
so that I could just pee in peace.

00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:43.376
(Laughter)

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.115
So anytime I would enter a restroom,

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.096
I would thrust out my chest
to show my womanly parts,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.256
and try to be as
non-threatening as possible.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.256
Putting out my hands and saying, "Hello",

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.960
just so that people
could hear my feminine voice.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.536
This all gets pretty exhausting,
but it's just who I am.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.360
I can't be anything else.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.536
JC: After Nepal, we traveled to India.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.096
On one hand, India is a Hindu society,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.016
without a tradition of homophobia.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.296
On the other hand, it is also a society
with a deeply patriarchal system,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.456
which rejects anything
that threatens the male-female order.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.096
When we spoke to activists,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.256
they told us that empowerment begins
with ensuring proper gender equality,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.336
where the women's status
is established in society.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.416
And in that way, the status of LGBT people
can be affirmed as well.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.896
LD: There we met Prince Manvendra.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.616
He's the world's first openly gay prince.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.176
Prince Manvendra came out
on the "Oprah Winfrey Show,"

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.456
very internationally.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.736
His parents disowned him

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.016
and accused him of bringing
great shame to the royal family.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.656
We sat down with Prince Manvendra

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.536
and talked to him about why he decided
to come out so very publicly.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.776
Here he is:

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.336
(Video) Prince Manvendra: 
I felt there was a lot of need

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.536
to break this stigma and discrimination
which is existing in our society.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.696
And that instigated me to come out openly
and talk about myself.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.176
Whether we are gay, we are lesbian,
we are transgender, bisexual

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.536
or whatever sexual minority we come from,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.616
we have to all unite
and fight for our rights.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.576
Gay rights cannot be won
in the court rooms,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.000
but in the hearts and the minds
of the people.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.656
JC: While getting my hair cut,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.936
the woman cutting my hair asked me,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.776
"Do you have a husband?"

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.576
Now, this was a dreaded question

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.176
that I got asked a lot
by locals while traveling.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.896
When I explained to her
that I was with a woman instead of a man,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.256
she was incredulous,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.656
and she asked me a lot of questions
about my parents' reactions

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.200
and whether I was sad
that I'd never be able to have children.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.056
I told her that there are
no limitations to my life

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.120
and that Lisa and I do plan
to have a family some day.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.416
Now, this woman was ready to write me off

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.480
as yet another crazy Westerner.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.296
She couldn't imagine
that such a phenomenon

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.336
could happen in her own country.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.980
That is, until I showed her
the photos of the Supergays

00:06:07.004 --> 00:06:08.484
that we interviewed in India.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.016
She recognized Prince Manvendra
from television

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.279
and soon I had an audience
of other hairdressers

00:06:14.303 --> 00:06:15.494
interested in meeting me.

00:06:15.518 --> 00:06:17.376
(Laughter)

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.696
And in that ordinary afternoon,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.656
I had the chance to introduce
an entire beauty salon

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.360
to the social changes
that were happening in their own country.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.136
LD: From India,
we traveled to East Africa,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.136
a region known for intolerance
towards LGBT people.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.656
In Kenya, 89 percent of people
who come out to their families

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.976
are disowned.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.696
Homosexual acts are a crime
and can lead to incarceration.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.376
In Kenya, we met
the soft-spoken David Kuria.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.336
David had a huge mission
of wanting to work for the poor

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.096
and improve his own government.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.256
So he decided to run for senate.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.936
He became Kenya's first
openly gay political candidate.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.616
David wanted to run his campaign
without denying the reality of who he was.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.296
But we were worried for his safety

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.576
because he started
to receive death threats.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.216
(Video) David Kuria: 
At that point, I was really scared

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.016
because they were
actually asking for me to be killed.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.856
And, yeah,

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.136
there are some people out there who do it

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.827
and they feel that they are doing
a religious obligation.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.376
JC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.256
Even in the face of threats,

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.480
he stayed authentic.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.096
LD: At the opposite end
of the spectrum is Argentina.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.416
Argentina's a country where 92 percent
of the population identifies as Catholic.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.136
Yet, Argentina has LGBT laws
that are even more progressive

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.496
than here in the US.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.936
In 2010, Argentina became
the first country in Latin America

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.800
and the 10th in the world
to adopt marriage equality.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.656
There, we met María Rachid.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.296
María was a driving force
behind that movement.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.856
María Rachid (Spanish):
I always say that, in reality,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.456
the effects of marriage equality

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.736
are not only for those couples
that get married.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.256
They are for a lot of people that,
even though they may never get married,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.616
will be perceived differently
by their coworkers,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.696
their families and neighbors,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.176
from the national state's
message of equality.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.056
I feel very proud of Argentina

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.096
because Argentina today
is a model of equality.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.696
And hopefully soon,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.656
the whole world will have the same rights.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.416
JC: When we made the visit
to my ancestral lands,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.496
I wish I could have shown
my parents what we found there.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.456
Because here is who we met:

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.616
(Video) One, two, three.
Welcome gays to Shanghai!

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.080
(Laughter)

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:52.016
A whole community of young,
beautiful Chinese LGBT people.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.536
Sure, they had their struggles.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.816
But they were fighting it out.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.896
In Shanghai, I had the chance
to speak to a local lesbian group

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.576
and tell them our story
in my broken Mandarin Chinese.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.256
In Taipei, each time
we got onto the metro,

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.456
we saw yet another
lesbian couple holding hands.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.616
And we learned that Asia's
largest LGBT pride event

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.016
happens just blocks away
from where my grandparents live.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.760
If only my parents knew.

00:09:21.387 --> 00:09:24.816
LD: By the time we finished our
not-so-straight journey around the world,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.056
(Laughter)

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.776
we had traveled 50,000 miles

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.456
and logged 120 hours of video footage.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.976
We traveled to 15 countries

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.056
and interviewed 50 Supergays.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.720
Turns out, it wasn't hard
to find them at all.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.976
JC: Yes, there are still
tragedies that happen

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.256
on the bumpy road to equality.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.080
And let's not forget that 75 countries
still criminalize homosexuality today.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.336
But there are also stories
of hope and courage

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.520
in every corner of the world.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.696
What we ultimately took away
from our journey is,

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.440
equality is not a Western invention.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.136
LD: One of the key factors
in this equality movement is momentum,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.536
momentum as more and more people
embrace their full selves

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.696
and use whatever opportunities they have

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.936
to change their part of the world,

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.176
and momentum as more and more countries

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.176
find models of equality in one another.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.736
When Nepal protected
against LGBT discrimination,

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.536
India pushed harder.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.456
When Argentina embraced marriage equality,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.696
Uruguay and Brazil followed.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.656
When Ireland said yes to equality,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.736
(Applause)

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.696
the world stopped to notice.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.376
When the US Supreme Court
makes a statement to the world

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.736
that we can all be proud of.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.280
(Applause)

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.096
JC: As we reviewed our footage,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.056
what we realized is that
we were watching a love story.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.856
It wasn't a love story
that was expected of me,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.216
but it is one filled
with more freedom, adventure and love

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.176
than I could have ever possibly imagined.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.736
One year after returning home
from our trip,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.736
marriage equality came to California.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.520
And in the end, we believe,
love will win out.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.416
(Video) By the power vested in me,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.016
by the state of California

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.296
and by God Almighty,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.656
I now pronounce you spouses for life.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.896
You may kiss.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.800
(Applause)
