WEBVTT

00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:06.362
This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement.

00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:10.491
This might be the most
important sneaker in history.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.914
First released in 1988,

00:00:12.938 --> 00:00:16.479
this is the shoe that started
Nike marketing as we know it.

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:20.840
This is the shoe that propelled
the entire Air Jordan lineage,

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:22.883
and perhaps saved Nike.

00:00:22.907 --> 00:00:25.820
The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement
did for sneakers

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:27.635
what the iPhone did for phones.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.130
It's been re-released four times.

00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:32.781
Every celebrity's been seen wearing it.

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:35.460
There's a site about what to wear
with the Black Cement.

00:00:35.484 --> 00:00:38.124
It's been right under
your nose for decades

00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:40.130
and you never looked down.

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:42.343
And right about now,

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:45.766
most of you are probably
thinking, "Sneakers?"

00:00:46.097 --> 00:00:48.052
(Laughter)

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:49.238
Yes.

00:00:49.262 --> 00:00:50.833
Yes, sneakers.

00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:55.388
Some extraordinary things about sneakers

00:00:55.412 --> 00:00:57.001
and data

00:00:57.025 --> 00:00:58.500
and Nike

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:02.753
and how they're all related, possibly,
to the future of all online commerce.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:04.419
In 2011,

00:01:04.443 --> 00:01:07.422
the last time the Jordan 3
Black Cement was released,

00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:09.779
at a retail of 160 dollars,

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.262
it sold out globally in minutes.

00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:15.279
And that's because people were camped
outside of sneaker stores

00:01:15.303 --> 00:01:17.074
for days before it went on sale.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:18.843
And just minutes after that,

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:22.402
thousands of those pairs were on eBay
for two and three times retail.

00:01:22.923 --> 00:01:27.304
In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay
right now, four years later.

00:01:28.107 --> 00:01:29.705
But here's the thing:

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.187
this happens every single Saturday.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.107
Every week there's another
release or two or three,

00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:38.385
and every shoe has a story

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.339
as rich and compelling
as the Jordan 3 Black Cement.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.225
This is Nike building
the marketplace for sneakerheads --

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:50.025
people who collect sneakers --

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.297
and my daughter.

00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:53.246
(Laughter)

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.337
That's an "I love Dad" T-shirt.

00:01:56.244 --> 00:01:59.413
For the brands, sneakerheads
are a very important demographic.

00:01:59.437 --> 00:02:03.359
These are the tastemakers;
these are the Apple fanboys.

00:02:03.383 --> 00:02:04.922
Because who else is going to buy

00:02:04.946 --> 00:02:08.162
a pair of $8,000
Back to the Future sneakers?

00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:10.441
(Laughter)

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:12.542
Yeah, 8,000 dollars.

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:15.715
And while that's obviously the anomaly,

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.917
the resell sneaker market
is definitely not.

00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:20.765
Thirty years in the making,

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.725
what started as an underground culture

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.730
of a few people who like sneakers
just a bit too much --

00:02:25.754 --> 00:02:27.154
(Laughter)

00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:30.734
Now we have sneaker addictions.

00:02:30.758 --> 00:02:32.686
In a market where in the past 12 months,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.964
there have been over
nine million pairs of shoes

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.381
resold in the United States alone,

00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:41.645
at a value of 1.2 billion dollars.

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.708
And that's a conservative estimate --

00:02:43.732 --> 00:02:46.935
I should know, I am a sneakerhead.

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.466
This is my collection.

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:52.876
In the pantheon of great collections,
mine doesn't even register.

00:02:53.392 --> 00:02:56.438
I have about 250 pairs,
but trust me, I am small-time.

00:02:56.462 --> 00:02:58.417
People have thousands.

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.443
I'm a very typical
37-year-old sneakerhead.

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.772
I grew up playing basketball
when Michael Jordan played,

00:03:04.796 --> 00:03:06.136
I always wanted Air Jordans,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.129
my mother would never buy me Air Jordans,

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:10.546
as soon as I got some money
I bought Air Jordans --

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.643
literally, we all have
the exact same story.

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.362
But here's where mine diverged.

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:19.261
After starting three companies,
I took a job as a strategy consultant,

00:03:19.285 --> 00:03:23.199
when I very quickly realized that
I didn't know the first thing about data.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.738
But I learned, because I had to,

00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:28.056
and I liked it.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.492
So I thought, I wonder if I could
get ahold of some sneaker data,

00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:33.528
just to play with for my own amusement.

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.822
The goal was to develop a price guide,

00:03:35.846 --> 00:03:38.043
a real data-driven view of the market.

00:03:38.373 --> 00:03:42.702
And four years later, we're analyzing
over 25 million transactions,

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:45.642
providing real-time analytics
on thousands of sneakers.

00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.882
Now sneakerheads check prices
while camping out for releases.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.690
Others have used the data
to validate insurance claims.

00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:56.762
And the top investment banks in the world

00:03:56.786 --> 00:04:01.392
now use resell data to analyze
the retail footwear industry.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:03.006
And here's the best part:

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.559
sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.085
(Laughter)

00:04:08.617 --> 00:04:11.590
Sneakerheads can track the value
of their collection over time,

00:04:11.614 --> 00:04:12.765
compare it to others,

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.019
and have access to the same
analytics you might

00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:16.963
for your online brokerage account.

00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:21.891
So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection
and identifies which 352 are his.

00:04:21.915 --> 00:04:24.804
He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars --

00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:26.829
frankly, a modest collection.

00:04:26.853 --> 00:04:30.462
At the asset level,
he can see gain-loss by shoe.

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:33.000
Here he's made over
600 dollars on one pair.

00:04:34.183 --> 00:04:35.514
I have one of those.

00:04:35.538 --> 00:04:37.117
(Laughter)

00:04:38.655 --> 00:04:42.102
So an unregulated
1.2 billion dollar industry

00:04:42.126 --> 00:04:44.695
that thrives as much on the street
as it does online,

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:48.465
and has spawned fundamental
financial services for sneakers?

00:04:49.113 --> 00:04:52.249
At some point I asked myself
what's really going on in the market,

00:04:52.273 --> 00:04:54.588
and two comparisons started to emerge.

00:04:54.612 --> 00:04:58.363
Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs?

00:04:58.387 --> 00:04:59.588
(Laughter)

00:04:59.612 --> 00:05:01.480
In fact, one guy emailed to say

00:05:01.504 --> 00:05:05.768
he thought his 15-year-old son
was selling drugs

00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:08.323
and later found out
he was selling sneakers.

00:05:08.853 --> 00:05:10.014
(Laughter)

00:05:10.757 --> 00:05:13.288
And now they use the data
to do it together.

00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:16.409
And that's because sneakers
are an investment opportunity

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:17.592
where none other exists.

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:20.653
And I don't just mean the kid
selling sneakers instead of drugs.

00:05:20.677 --> 00:05:22.367
How about all kids?

00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:25.144
You have to be 18
to play the stock market.

00:05:25.967 --> 00:05:28.307
I sold chewing gum in sixth grade,

00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:29.909
Blow Pops in ninth grade

00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:32.354
and collected baseball cards
through high school.

00:05:32.378 --> 00:05:34.175
The cards are long dead,

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.572
and the candy market's
usually quite local.

00:05:37.122 --> 00:05:42.849
For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal
and accessible investment opportunity --

00:05:42.873 --> 00:05:46.640
a democratized stock market,

00:05:46.664 --> 00:05:48.735
but also unregulated.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.541
Which is why the story
you're probably most familiar with

00:05:51.565 --> 00:05:53.980
is people killing each other for sneakers.

00:05:54.606 --> 00:05:58.381
And while that definitely
happens and is tragic,

00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:02.250
it's not nearly the epidemic
some media would have you believe.

00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:06.459
In fact, it's a very small piece
of a much bigger and better story.

00:06:06.483 --> 00:06:08.179
So sneakers have clear similarities

00:06:08.203 --> 00:06:11.307
to both the stock exchange
and the illegal drug trade,

00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:15.728
but perhaps the most fundamental
is the existence of a central actor.

00:06:15.752 --> 00:06:17.735
Someone is making the rules.

00:06:18.988 --> 00:06:22.981
In the case of sneakers,
that someone is Nike.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.162
Let me walk you through some numbers.

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:29.422
The resell market,
we know, is $1.2 billion.

00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:31.744
Nike, including Jordan brand,

00:06:31.768 --> 00:06:36.284
accounts for 96 percent of all shoes
sold on the secondary market.

00:06:36.308 --> 00:06:37.900
Just complete domination.

00:06:37.924 --> 00:06:40.512
Sneakerheads love Jordans.

00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:43.547
And profit on the secondary market
is about a third.

00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:48.641
That means that sneakerheads
made 380 million dollars

00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:50.553
selling Nikes last year.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.047
Let's jump to retail for a second.

00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:54.491
Skechers, earlier this year,

00:06:54.515 --> 00:06:57.305
became the number two
footwear brand in the country,

00:06:57.329 --> 00:07:00.163
surpassing Adidas --
this was a big deal.

00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:02.961
And in the 12 months ending in June,

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:07.049
Skechers's net income
was 209 million dollars.

00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:11.187
That means that Nike's customers

00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:14.747
make almost twice as much profit
as their closest competitor.

00:07:15.758 --> 00:07:17.557
That --

00:07:17.581 --> 00:07:21.005
(Laughter)

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:22.605
How is that even possible?

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:26.830
The sneaker market
is just supply and demand,

00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:31.576
but Nike's gotten very good at using
supply -- limited sneakers --

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.413
and the distribution of those sneakers
to their own benefit.

00:07:35.437 --> 00:07:37.449
So it's really just supply.

00:07:37.473 --> 00:07:41.238
Sneakerheads joke that as long
as it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it.

00:07:41.262 --> 00:07:45.071
Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars
do so because they're very rare.

00:07:45.095 --> 00:07:47.861
It's no different than any other
collectible market,

00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:50.965
only this isn't a market at all.

00:07:51.508 --> 00:07:53.953
It's a false construct created by Nike --

00:07:53.977 --> 00:07:58.258
ingeniously created by Nike, in the most
positive sense -- to sell more shoes.

00:07:58.613 --> 00:07:59.764
And in the process,

00:07:59.788 --> 00:08:03.156
it provided tens of thousands of people
with life-long passions,

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.661
myself included.

00:08:05.488 --> 00:08:08.703
If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,
they could do so tomorrow,

00:08:08.727 --> 00:08:10.759
all they have to do is release more shoes.

00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:14.300
But we certainly don't want them to,
nor is it in their best interest.

00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:19.582
That's because unlike Apple, who will sell
an iPhone to anyone who wants one,

00:08:19.606 --> 00:08:23.424
Nike doesn't make their money
by just selling $200 sneakers.

00:08:23.448 --> 00:08:26.699
They sell millions of shoes to millions
of people for 60 dollars.

00:08:27.146 --> 00:08:29.685
And sneakerheads are the ones
who drive the marketing

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.239
and the hype and the PR
and the brand cachet,

00:08:32.263 --> 00:08:35.803
and enable Nike to sell millions
of $60 sneakers.

00:08:37.501 --> 00:08:38.882
It's marketing.

00:08:38.906 --> 00:08:42.018
It's marketing the likes of which
has never been seen before --

00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:43.462
this isn't in any textbook.

00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:47.026
For 15 years Nike has propped up
an artificial commodities market,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.513
with a Facebook-level hyped IPO
every single weekend.

00:08:51.537 --> 00:08:54.210
Drive by any Footlocker at 8am
on a Saturday morning,

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:57.185
and there will be a line down the street
and around the block,

00:08:57.209 --> 00:09:00.070
and sometimes those kids
have been waiting there all week.

00:09:00.437 --> 00:09:04.208
You know those crazy iPhone lines
you see on the news every other year?

00:09:04.232 --> 00:09:08.522
Nike lines happen 104 times more often.

00:09:09.075 --> 00:09:10.603
So Nike sets the rules.

00:09:10.627 --> 00:09:13.401
And they do so by controlling
supply and distribution.

00:09:14.014 --> 00:09:17.911
But once a pair leaves
the retail channel, it's the Wild West.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:24.003
There are very few -- if any --
legal, unregulated markets of this size.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.803
So Nike is definitely
not the stock exchange.

00:09:27.827 --> 00:09:30.610
In fact, there is no central exchange.

00:09:30.634 --> 00:09:35.372
By last count, there were 48 different
online markets that I know of.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.478
Some are eBay clones,
some are mobile markets,

00:09:39.502 --> 00:09:42.524
and then you have consignment shops
and brick-and-mortar stores,

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:44.612
and sneaker conventions,
and reseller sites,

00:09:44.636 --> 00:09:47.041
and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter --

00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:50.597
literally, anywhere sneakerheads
come into contact with each other,

00:09:50.621 --> 00:09:52.611
shoes will be bought and sold.

00:09:53.504 --> 00:09:58.515
But that means no efficiencies,
no transparency,

00:09:58.539 --> 00:10:00.755
sometimes not even authenticity.

00:10:01.584 --> 00:10:04.377
Can you imagine if that's
how stocks were bought?

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:07.409
What if the way to buy
a share of Apple stock

00:10:07.433 --> 00:10:10.288
was to search over 100 places
online and off,

00:10:10.312 --> 00:10:12.535
including every time
you walk down the street

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:15.197
just hoping to pass someone
wearing some Apple stock?

00:10:15.221 --> 00:10:17.088
Never knowing who had the best price,

00:10:17.112 --> 00:10:19.679
or even if the stock
you were looking at was real.

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.520
That would surely make you say:

00:10:21.544 --> 00:10:23.598
[WTF?]

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:25.909
Of course that's not how we buy stock.

00:10:26.904 --> 00:10:29.923
But what if that's not how
we need to buy sneakers either?

00:10:30.923 --> 00:10:32.305
What if the inverse is true,

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:33.915
and what if we could buy sneakers

00:10:33.939 --> 00:10:35.732
exactly the same way as we buy stock?

00:10:35.756 --> 00:10:38.645
And what if it wasn't just sneakers,
but any similar product,

00:10:38.669 --> 00:10:40.772
like watches and handbags
and women's shoes,

00:10:40.796 --> 00:10:44.144
and any collectible, any seasonal item
and any markdown item?

00:10:44.168 --> 00:10:47.411
What if there was
a stock market for commerce?

00:10:48.046 --> 00:10:50.868
A stock market of things.

00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:56.490
And not only could you buy in a much more
educated and efficient manner,

00:10:56.514 --> 00:10:59.754
but you could engage in all
the sophisticated financial transactions

00:10:59.778 --> 00:11:01.361
you can with the stock market.

00:11:01.385 --> 00:11:02.988
Shorts and options and futures

00:11:03.012 --> 00:11:06.122
and well, maybe you see
where this is going.

00:11:06.146 --> 00:11:10.069
Maybe you want to invest
in a stock market of things.

00:11:10.997 --> 00:11:17.269
Because if you had invested in a pair
of Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011,

00:11:17.293 --> 00:11:19.690
you could either be wearing them onstage,

00:11:19.714 --> 00:11:21.633
(Laughter)

00:11:21.657 --> 00:11:24.954
or have earned 162 percent
on your money --

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.015
double the S&amp;P and 20 percent
more than Apple.

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:30.758
(Laughter)

00:11:31.203 --> 00:11:33.664
And that's why
we're talking about sneakers.

00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:35.379
Thank you.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:38.325
(Applause)
