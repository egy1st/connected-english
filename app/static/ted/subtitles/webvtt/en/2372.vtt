00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.616
Religion is more than belief.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.456
It's power, and it's influence.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.096
And that influence affects all of us,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.976
every day, regardless of your own belief.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.056
Despite the enormous influence
of religion on the world today,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.856
we hold them to a different standard
of scrutiny and accountability

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.936
than any other sector of our society.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.376
For example, if there were
a multinational organization,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.456
government or corporation today

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.736
that said no female
could be on a leadership board,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.856
not one woman could have
a decision-making authority,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.736
not one woman could handle
any financial matter,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.136
we would have outrage.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.816
There would be sanctions.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.376
And yet this is a common practice
in almost every world religion today.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.816
We accept things in our religious lives

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.936
that we do not accept
in our secular lives,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.016
and I know this because I've been
doing it for three decades.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.536
I was the type of girl that fought every
form of gender discrimination growing up.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.576
I played pickup basketball games
with the boys and inserted myself.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.036
I said I was going to be the first
female President of the United States.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.496
I have been fighting
for the Equal Rights Amendment,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.976
which has been dead for 40 years.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.136
I'm the first woman
in both sides of my family

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.336
to ever work outside the home
and ever receive a higher education.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.176
I never accepted being excluded
because I was a woman,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.376
except in my religion.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.776
Throughout all of that time,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.096
I was a part of a very patriarchal
orthodox Mormon religion.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.896
I grew up in an enormously
traditional family.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.056
I have eight siblings,
a stay-at-home mother.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.280
My father's actually
a religious leader in the community.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.016
And I grew up in a world believing
that my worth and my standing

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.096
was in keeping these rules
that I'd known my whole life.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.936
You get married a virgin,
you never drink alcohol,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.336
you don't smoke, you always do service,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.336
you're a good kid.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.936
Some of the rules we had were strict,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.576
but you followed the rules
because you loved the people

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.256
and you loved the religion
and you believed.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.096
Everything about Mormonism
determined what you wore,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.626
who you dated, who you married.

00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:20.000
It determined what underwear we wore.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.096
I was the kind of religious
where everyone I know

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.496
donated 10 percent of everything
they earned to the church,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.736
including myself.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.696
From paper routes and babysitting,
I donated 10 percent.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.776
I was the kind of religious
where I heard parents tell children

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.416
when they're leaving
on a two-year proselytizing mission

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.976
that they would rather have them die

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.216
than return home
without honor, having sinned.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.696
I was the type and the kind of religious

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.176
where kids kill themselves
every single year

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.536
because they're terrified
of coming out to our community as gay.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.576
But I was also the kind of religious

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.136
where it didn't matter
where in the world I lived,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.936
I had friendship,
instantaneous mutual aid.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.176
This was where I felt safe.
This is certainty and clarity about life.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.456
I had help raising my little daughter.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.376
So that's why I accepted without question
that only men can lead,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.536
and I accepted without question

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.696
that women can't have the spiritual
authority of God on the Earth,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.136
which we call the priesthood.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.656
And I allowed discrepancies between
men and women in operating budgets,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.056
disciplinary councils,
in decision-making capacities,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.216
and I gave my religion a free pass

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.096
because I loved it.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.096
Until I stopped,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.736
and I realized that I had
been allowing myself to be treated

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.656
as the support staff
to the real work of men.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.056
And I faced this contradiction in myself,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.816
and I joined with other activists
in my community.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.216
We've been working very, very, very hard
for the last decade and more.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.454
The first thing we did
was raise consciousness.

00:03:57.478 --> 00:03:59.976
You can't change what you can't see.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.216
We started podcasting,
blogging, writing articles.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.776
I created lists of hundreds of ways

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.816
that men and women
are unequal in our community.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.336
The next thing we did
was build advocacy organizations.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.296
We tried to do things
that were unignorable,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.776
like wearing pants to church
and trying to attend all-male meetings.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.296
These seem like simple things,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.536
but to us, the organizers,
they were enormously costly.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.816
We lost relationships. We lost jobs.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.896
We got hate mail on a daily basis.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.256
We were attacked in social media
and national press.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.976
We received death threats.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.216
We lost standing in our community.
Some of us got excommunicated.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.136
Most of us got put
in front of a disciplinary council,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.296
and were rejected
from the communities that we loved

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.320
because we wanted to make them better,
because we believed that they could be.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.736
And I began to expect this reaction
from my own people.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.696
I know what it feels like when you feel
like someone's trying to change you

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.736
or criticize you.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.896
But what utterly shocked me
was throughout all of this work

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.120
I received equal measures of vitriol
from the secular left,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.096
the same vehemence as the religious right.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.976
And what my secular friends didn't realize
was that this religious hostility,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.136
these phrases of, "Oh, all religious
people are crazy or stupid."

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.216
"Don't pay attention to religion."

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.576
"They're going to be
homophobic and sexist."

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.656
What they didn't understand

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.240
was that that type of hostility
did not fight religious extremism,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.616
it bred religious extremism.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.056
Those arguments don't work,
and I know because I remember

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.120
someone telling me
that I was stupid for being Mormon.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.656
And what it caused me to do
was defend myself and my people

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.160
and everything we believe in,
because we're not stupid.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.496
So criticism and hostility doesn't work,
and I didn't listen to these arguments.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.216
When I hear these arguments,
I still continue to bristle,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.896
because I have family and friends.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.616
These are my people,
and I'm the first to defend them,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.656
but the struggle is real.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.456
How do we respect
someone's religious beliefs

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.776
while still holding them accountable
for the harm or damage

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.096
that those beliefs may cause others?

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.896
It's a tough question.
I still don't have a perfect answer.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.056
My parents and I have been walking
on this tightrope for the last decade.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.816
They're intelligent people.
They're lovely people.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.736
And let me try to help you
understand their perspective.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.736
In Mormonism, we believe
that after you die,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.096
if you keep all the rules
and you follow all the rituals,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.216
you can be together as a family again.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.656
And to my parents,
me doing something as simple

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.056
as having a sleeveless top right now,
showing my shoulders,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.856
that makes me unworthy.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.216
I won't be with my family
in the eternities.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.416
But even more, I had a brother
die in a tragic accident at 15,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.696
and something as simple as this
means we won't be together as a family.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.296
And to my parents, they cannot understand

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.416
why something as simple
as fashion or women's rights

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.136
would prevent me
from seeing my brother again.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.896
And that's the mindset
that we're dealing with,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.016
and criticism does not change that.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.736
And so my parents and I
have been walking this tightrope,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.696
explaining our sides,
respecting one another,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.696
but actually invalidating
each other's very basic beliefs

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.056
by the way we live our lives,
and it's been difficult.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.536
The way that we've been able to do that

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.976
is to get past those defensive shells

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.016
and really see the soft inside
of unbelief and belief

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.656
and try to respect each other
while still holding boundaries clear.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.136
The other thing that the secular left
and the atheists and the orthodox

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.176
and the religious right,
what they all don't understand

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.056
was why even care
about religious activism?

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.136
I cannot tell you the hundreds
of people who have said,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.776
"If you don't like religion, just leave."

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.680
Why would you try to change it?

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.317
Because what is taught on the Sabbath

00:08:09.342 --> 00:08:12.376
leaks into our politics,
our health policy,

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.256
violence around the world.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.976
It leaks into education,
military, fiscal decision-making.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.296
These laws get legally
and culturally codified.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.256
In fact, my own religion has had
an enormous effect on this nation.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.856
For example, during Prop 8,
my church raised over 22 million dollars

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.159
to fight same-sex marriage in California.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.056
Forty years ago,
political historians will say,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.936
that if it wasn't for the Mormon
opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.776
we'd have an Equal Rights Amendment
in our Constitution today.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.960
How many lives did that affect?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.576
And we can spend time
fighting every single one

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.736
of these little tiny laws and rules,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.336
or we can ask ourselves,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.536
why is gender inequality
the default around the world?

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.216
Why is that the assumption?

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:13.176
Because religion doesn't just
create the roots of morality,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.256
it creates the seeds of normality.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.616
Religions can liberate or subjugate,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.856
they can empower or exploit,
they can comfort or destroy,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.416
and the people that tip the scales
over to the ethical and the moral

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.576
are often not those in charge.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.496
Religions can't be dismissed or ignored.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.416
We need to take them seriously.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.976
But it's not easy to influence a religion,
like we just talked about.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.216
But I'll tell you
what my people have done.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.336
My groups are small,
there's hundreds of us,

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.736
but we've had huge impact.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.776
Right now, women's pictures
are hanging in the halls next to men

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.016
for the first time.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.776
Women are now allowed
to pray in our church-wide meetings,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.816
and they never were before
in the general conferences.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.376
As of last week, in a historic move,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.576
three women were invited
down to three leadership boards

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.576
that oversee the entire church.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.416
We've seen perceptual shifts
in the Mormon community

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.936
that allow for talk of gender inequality.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.336
We've opened up space,
regardless of being despised,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.256
for more conservative women
to step in and make real changes,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.136
and the words "women" and "the priesthood"
can now be uttered in the same sentence.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.776
I never had that.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.376
My daughter and my nieces are inheriting
a religion that I never had,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.160
that's more equal -- we've had an effect.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.296
It wasn't easy standing in those lines

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.496
trying to get into those male meetings.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.696
There were hundreds of us,

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.336
and one by one, when we got to the door,

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.016
we were told, "I'm sorry,
this meeting is just for men,"

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.816
and we had to step back
and watch men get into the meeting

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.976
as young as 12 years old,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.056
escorted and walked past us
as we all stood in line.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.816
But not one woman in that line
will forget that day,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.800
and not one little boy
that walked past us will forget that day.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.136
If we were a multinational corporation
or a government, and that had happened,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.776
there would be outrage,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.216
but we're just a religion.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.200
We're all just part of religions.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.856
We can't keep looking
at religion that way,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.736
because it doesn't only affect me,
it affects my daughter

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.736
and all of your daughters
and what opportunities they have,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.013
what they can wear,
who they can love and marry,

00:11:34.038 --> 00:11:37.136
if they have access
to reproductive healthcare.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.496
We need to reclaim morality
in a secular context

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.776
that creates ethical scrutiny
and accountability

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.976
for religions all around the world,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.136
but we need to do it in a respectful way

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.376
that breeds cooperation and not extremism.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.456
And we can do it through
unignorable acts of bravery,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.816
standing up for gender equality.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.336
It's time that half
of the world's population

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.296
had voice and equality
within our world's religions,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.856
churches, synagogues, mosques
and shrines around the world.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.440
I'm working on my people.
What are you doing for yours?

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:19.240
(Applause)
