00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.515
Have you ever wondered
what animals think and feel?

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.904
Let's start with a question:

00:00:07.654 --> 00:00:11.773
Does my dog really love me,
or does she just want a treat?

00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:17.958
Well, it's easy to see
that our dog really loves us,

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:20.063
easy to see, right,

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:23.737
what's going on in that fuzzy little head.

00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:25.968
What is going on?

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:28.881
Something's going on.

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:34.263
But why is the question always
do they love us?

00:00:34.287 --> 00:00:36.398
Why is it always about us?

00:00:36.422 --> 00:00:39.065
Why are we such narcissists?

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:43.713
I found a different question
to ask animals.

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:47.328
Who are you?

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.805
There are capacities of the human mind

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.691
that we tend to think are capacities
only of the human mind.

00:00:58.176 --> 00:00:59.534
But is that true?

00:01:00.047 --> 00:01:04.022
What are other beings
doing with those brains?

00:01:04.554 --> 00:01:06.907
What are they thinking and feeling?

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.203
Is there a way to know?

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:10.901
I think there is a way in.

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:12.615
I think there are several ways in.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.072
We can look at evolution,
we can look at their brains

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:19.576
and we can watch what they do.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:25.255
The first thing to remember is:
our brain is inherited.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:29.960
The first neurons came from jellyfish.

00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:33.275
Jellyfish gave rise
to the first chordates.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.967
The first chordates gave rise
to the first vertebrates.

00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:39.695
The vertebrates came out of the sea,

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.055
and here we are.

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:48.327
But it's still true that a neuron,
a nerve cell, looks the same

00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:51.768
in a crayfish, a bird or you.

00:01:52.427 --> 00:01:55.968
What does that say
about the minds of crayfish?

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.437
Can we tell anything about that?

00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:02.490
Well, it turns out that
if you give a crayfish

00:02:02.514 --> 00:02:05.171
a lot of little tiny electric shocks

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:07.491
every time it tries
to come out of its burrow,

00:02:07.515 --> 00:02:09.700
it will develop anxiety.

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:14.551
If you give the crayfish the same drug

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:17.498
used to treat anxiety disorder in humans,

00:02:17.522 --> 00:02:20.603
it relaxes and comes out and explores.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.395
How do we show how much
we care about crayfish anxiety?

00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:27.259
Mostly, we boil them.

00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:28.599
(Laughter)

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.848
Octopuses use tools,
as well as do most apes

00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:38.215
and they recognize human faces.

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:43.592
How do we celebrate the ape-like
intelligence of this invertebrate?

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.446
Mostly boiled.

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.975
If a grouper chases a fish
into a crevice in the coral,

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:55.975
it will sometimes go to where it knows
a moray eel is sleeping

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.572
and it will signal
to the moray, "Follow me,"

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.137
and the moray will understand that signal.

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:05.793
The moray may go into the crevice
and get the fish,

00:03:05.817 --> 00:03:08.475
but the fish may bolt
and the grouper may get it.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.911
This is an ancient partnership that we
have just recently found out about.

00:03:14.935 --> 00:03:18.020
How do we celebrate
that ancient partnership?

00:03:18.044 --> 00:03:19.622
Mostly fried.

00:03:20.918 --> 00:03:24.518
A pattern is emerging and it says
a lot more about us

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:26.702
than it does about them.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.015
Sea otters use tools

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.016
and they take time away
from what they're doing

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.181
to show their babies what to do,
which is called teaching.

00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:39.883
Chimpanzees don't teach.

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:44.809
Killer whales teach
and killer whales share food.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.913
When evolution makes something new,

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:53.290
it uses the parts it has
in stock, off the shelf,

00:03:53.314 --> 00:03:55.776
before it fabricates a new twist.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.976
And our brain has come to us

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.401
through the enormity
of the deep sweep of time.

00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:06.014
If you look at the human brain
compared to a chimpanzee brain,

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:09.702
what you see is we have basically
a very big chimpanzee brain.

00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:13.667
It's a good thing ours is bigger,
because we're also really insecure.

00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.753
(Laughter)

00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:18.893
But, uh oh, there's a dolphin,

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:21.893
a bigger brain with more convolutions.

00:04:22.777 --> 00:04:25.484
OK, maybe you're saying,
all right, well, we see brains,

00:04:25.508 --> 00:04:27.935
but what does that
have to say about minds?

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:32.218
Well, we can see the working of the mind

00:04:32.242 --> 00:04:33.951
in the logic of behaviors.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.161
So these elephants, you can see,

00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:40.785
obviously, they are resting.

00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:45.482
They have found a patch of shade
under the palm trees

00:04:45.506 --> 00:04:48.306
under which to let their babies sleep,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.949
while they doze but remain vigilant.

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.343
We make perfect sense of that image

00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:57.998
just as they make perfect sense
of what they're doing

00:04:58.022 --> 00:05:01.824
because under the arc of the same sun
on the same plains,

00:05:01.848 --> 00:05:05.274
listening to the howls
of the same dangers,

00:05:05.298 --> 00:05:09.709
they became who they are
and we became who we are.

00:05:10.536 --> 00:05:12.712
We've been neighbors for a very long time.

00:05:12.736 --> 00:05:16.180
No one would mistake
these elephants as being relaxed.

00:05:16.204 --> 00:05:19.116
They're obviously very
concerned about something.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.116
What are they concerned about?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.320
It turns out that if you record
the voices of tourists

00:05:25.344 --> 00:05:30.038
and you play that recording
from a speaker hidden in bushes,

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:33.697
elephants will ignore it,
because tourists never bother elephants.

00:05:34.102 --> 00:05:38.844
But if you record the voices of herders

00:05:38.868 --> 00:05:43.957
who carry spears and often hurt elephants
in confrontations at water holes,

00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:48.675
the elephants will bunch up
and run away from the hidden speaker.

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.058
Not only do elephants know
that there are humans,

00:05:52.082 --> 00:05:54.618
they know that there are
different kinds of humans,

00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:58.224
and that some are OK
and some are dangerous.

00:05:58.248 --> 00:06:03.315
They have been watching us for much longer
than we have been watching them.

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:05.629
They know us better than we know them.

00:06:06.272 --> 00:06:09.120
We have the same imperatives:

00:06:09.144 --> 00:06:13.639
take care of our babies,
find food, try to stay alive.

00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:18.307
Whether we're outfitted for hiking
in the hills of Africa

00:06:18.331 --> 00:06:22.514
or outfitted for diving under the sea,
we are basically the same.

00:06:22.538 --> 00:06:24.516
We are kin under the skin.

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.402
The elephant has the same skeleton,

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:29.768
the killer whale has the same skeleton,

00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:31.028
as do we.

00:06:33.674 --> 00:06:35.936
We see helping where help is needed.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.188
We see curiosity in the young.

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:44.070
We see the bonds of family connections.

00:06:45.776 --> 00:06:47.823
We recognize affection.

00:06:48.522 --> 00:06:50.683
Courtship is courtship.

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:54.682
And then we ask, "Are they conscious?"

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.200
When you get general anesthesia,
it makes you unconscious,

00:06:58.224 --> 00:07:01.059
which means you have
no sensation of anything.

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:04.654
Consciousness is simply
the thing that feels like something.

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:09.441
If you see, if you hear, if you feel,
if you're aware of anything,

00:07:09.465 --> 00:07:12.517
you are conscious, and they are conscious.

00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:16.331
Some people say

00:07:16.355 --> 00:07:18.960
well, there are certain things
that make humans humans,

00:07:18.984 --> 00:07:20.906
and one of those things is empathy.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:26.617
Empathy is the mind's ability
to match moods with your companions.

00:07:27.442 --> 00:07:29.025
It's a very useful thing.

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:31.209
If your companions start to move quickly,

00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:33.468
you have to feel like
you need to hurry up.

00:07:33.492 --> 00:07:35.222
We're all in a hurry now.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:38.733
The oldest form of empathy
is contagious fear.

00:07:38.757 --> 00:07:41.603
If your companions suddenly
startle and fly away,

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.791
it does not work very well for you to say,

00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:46.718
"Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left."

00:07:46.742 --> 00:07:48.274
(Laughter)

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:54.975
Empathy is old, but empathy,
like everything else in life,

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:58.910
comes on a sliding scale
and has its elaboration.

00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:02.655
So there's basic empathy:
you feel sad, it makes me sad.

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:04.616
I see you happy, it makes me happy.

00:08:05.192 --> 00:08:07.975
Then there's something
that I call sympathy,

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:09.859
a little more removed:

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:13.832
"I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother
has just passed away.

00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:17.483
I don't feel that same grief,
but I get it; I know what you feel

00:08:17.507 --> 00:08:18.920
and it concerns me."

00:08:18.944 --> 00:08:21.561
And then if we're motivated
to act on sympathy,

00:08:21.585 --> 00:08:23.391
I call that compassion.

00:08:24.061 --> 00:08:27.611
Far from being the thing
that makes us human,

00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:30.975
human empathy is far from perfect.

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:36.010
We round up empathic creatures,
we kill them and we eat them.

00:08:36.034 --> 00:08:38.901
Now, maybe you say OK,
well, those are different species.

00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:42.643
That's just predation,
and humans are predators.

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:48.003
But we don't treat our own kind
too well either.

00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:52.366
People who seem to know
only one thing about animal behavior

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.363
know that you must never attribute
human thoughts and emotions

00:08:56.387 --> 00:08:58.188
to other species.

00:08:58.723 --> 00:09:00.544
Well, I think that's silly,

00:09:00.568 --> 00:09:04.690
because attributing human thoughts
and emotions to other species

00:09:04.714 --> 00:09:08.965
is the best first guess about what
they're doing and how they're feeling,

00:09:08.989 --> 00:09:12.302
because their brains
are basically the same as ours.

00:09:12.326 --> 00:09:14.057
They have the same structures.

00:09:14.081 --> 00:09:19.131
The same hormones that create
mood and motivation in us

00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:21.413
are in those brains as well.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:28.120
It is not scientific to say that they
are hungry when they're hunting

00:09:28.144 --> 00:09:31.091
and they're tired when
their tongues are hanging out,

00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:33.805
and then say when they're playing
with their children

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:35.740
and acting joyful and happy,

00:09:35.764 --> 00:09:40.553
we have no idea if they can possibly
be experiencing anything.

00:09:40.577 --> 00:09:42.571
That is not scientific.

00:09:43.619 --> 00:09:46.304
So OK, so a reporter said to me,

00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:50.636
"Maybe, but how do you really know
that other animals can think and feel?"

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.715
And I started to rifle
through all the hundreds

00:09:53.739 --> 00:09:56.238
of scientific references
that I put in my book

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.502
and I realized that the answer
was right in the room with me.

00:09:59.526 --> 00:10:03.279
When my dog gets off the rug
and comes over to me --

00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:05.065
not to the couch, to me --

00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:09.266
and she rolls over on her back
and exposes her belly,

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.158
she has had the thought,
"I would like my belly rubbed.

00:10:14.565 --> 00:10:17.101
I know that I can go over to Carl,

00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:19.438
he will understand what I'm asking.

00:10:20.084 --> 00:10:22.580
I know I can trust him
because we're family.

00:10:23.406 --> 00:10:26.121
He'll get the job done,
and it will feel good."

00:10:26.145 --> 00:10:28.031
(Laughter)

00:10:28.055 --> 00:10:31.384
She has thought and she has felt,

00:10:31.408 --> 00:10:34.072
and it's really not
more complicated than that.

00:10:34.096 --> 00:10:38.709
But we see other animals
and we say, "Oh look, killer whales,

00:10:38.733 --> 00:10:41.143
wolves, elephants:

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:42.778
that's not how they see it."

00:10:43.714 --> 00:10:48.008
That tall-finned male is L41.

00:10:48.032 --> 00:10:50.079
He's 38 years old.

00:10:50.103 --> 00:10:53.575
The female right on his left side is L22.

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:55.451
She's 44.

00:10:55.475 --> 00:10:58.110
They've known each other for decades.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.622
They know exactly who they are.

00:11:00.646 --> 00:11:02.197
They know who their friends are.

00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:03.919
They know who their rivals are.

00:11:03.943 --> 00:11:06.056
Their life follows the arc of a career.

00:11:06.802 --> 00:11:09.036
They know where they are all the time.

00:11:10.863 --> 00:11:13.238
This is an elephant named Philo.

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:15.495
He was a young male.

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:17.337
This is him four days later.

00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:24.329
Humans not only can feel grief,
we create an awful lot of it.

00:11:26.648 --> 00:11:28.962
We want to carve their teeth.

00:11:30.153 --> 00:11:33.457
Why can't we wait for them to die?

00:11:35.998 --> 00:11:39.466
Elephants once ranged from the shores
of the Mediterranean Sea

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.565
all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope.

00:11:41.589 --> 00:11:44.975
In 1980, there were vast
strongholds of elephant range

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:47.187
in Central and Eastern Africa.

00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:51.548
And now their range is shattered
into little shards.

00:11:51.572 --> 00:11:56.251
This is the geography of an animal
that we are driving to extinction,

00:11:56.275 --> 00:12:00.124
a fellow being, the most
magnificent creature on land.

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:05.316
Of course, we take much better care
of our wildlife in the United States.

00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:09.916
In Yellowstone National Park,
we killed every single wolf.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.389
We killed every single wolf
south of the Canadian border, actually.

00:12:13.413 --> 00:12:17.806
But in the park, park rangers
did that in the 1920s,

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.421
and then 60 years later
they had to bring them back,

00:12:20.445 --> 00:12:23.352
because the elk numbers
had gotten out of control.

00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:25.785
And then people came.

00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:29.533
People came by the thousands
to see the wolves,

00:12:29.557 --> 00:12:33.052
the most accessibly
visible wolves in the world.

00:12:33.512 --> 00:12:36.764
And I went there and I watched
this incredible family of wolves.

00:12:36.788 --> 00:12:38.241
A pack is a family.

00:12:38.265 --> 00:12:41.840
It has some breeding adults
and the young of several generations.

00:12:43.158 --> 00:12:47.774
And I watched the most famous, most stable
pack in Yellowstone National Park.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.500
And then, when they wandered
just outside the border,

00:12:51.524 --> 00:12:54.205
two of their adults were killed,

00:12:54.229 --> 00:12:56.482
including the mother,

00:12:56.506 --> 00:12:58.684
which we sometimes call the alpha female.

00:12:59.502 --> 00:13:03.745
The rest of the family immediately
descended into sibling rivalry.

00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:07.112
Sisters kicked out other sisters.

00:13:07.565 --> 00:13:11.046
That one on the left tried for days
to rejoin her family.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.762
They wouldn't let her
because they were jealous of her.

00:13:13.786 --> 00:13:16.599
She was getting too much attention
from two new males,

00:13:16.623 --> 00:13:18.641
and she was the precocious one.

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:20.318
That was too much for them.

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:23.067
She wound up wandering
outside the park and getting shot.

00:13:24.463 --> 00:13:27.872
The alpha male wound up
being ejected from his own family.

00:13:28.436 --> 00:13:30.439
As winter was coming in,

00:13:30.463 --> 00:13:34.213
he lost his territory,
his hunting support,

00:13:34.237 --> 00:13:36.708
the members of his family and his mate.

00:13:38.883 --> 00:13:42.507
We cause so much pain to them.

00:13:43.665 --> 00:13:48.625
The mystery is, why don't
they hurt us more than they do?

00:13:49.855 --> 00:13:53.053
This whale had just finished eating
part of a grey whale

00:13:53.077 --> 00:13:55.656
with his companions
who had killed that whale.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.764
Those people in the boat
had nothing at all to fear.

00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:01.988
This whale is T20.

00:14:02.488 --> 00:14:06.739
He had just finished tearing a seal
into three pieces with two companions.

00:14:07.168 --> 00:14:09.860
The seal weighed about as much
as the people in the boat.

00:14:09.884 --> 00:14:11.387
They had nothing to fear.

00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:13.611
They eat seals.

00:14:14.699 --> 00:14:16.385
Why don't they eat us?

00:14:18.823 --> 00:14:22.583
Why can we trust them around our toddlers?

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:30.390
Why is it that killer whales have returned
to researchers lost in thick fog

00:14:30.414 --> 00:14:33.744
and led them miles until the fog parted

00:14:33.768 --> 00:14:36.933
and the researchers' home
was right there on the shoreline?

00:14:36.957 --> 00:14:38.973
And that's happened more than one time.

00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:43.746
In the Bahamas, there's a woman
named Denise Herzing,

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.094
and she studies spotted dolphins
and they know her.

00:14:47.118 --> 00:14:49.716
She knows them very well.
She knows who they all are.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.002
They know her.
They recognize the research boat.

00:14:52.026 --> 00:14:54.256
When she shows up,
it's a big happy reunion.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.595
Except, one time showed up and they
didn't want to come near the boat,

00:14:57.619 --> 00:14:59.693
and that was really strange.

00:14:59.717 --> 00:15:01.881
And they couldn't figure out
what was going on

00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:03.405
until somebody came out on deck

00:15:03.429 --> 00:15:06.064
and announced that one
of the people onboard had died

00:15:06.088 --> 00:15:07.859
during a nap in his bunk.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.666
How could dolphins know
that one of the human hearts

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.159
had just stopped?

00:15:14.818 --> 00:15:17.108
Why would they care?

00:15:17.132 --> 00:15:19.325
And why would it spook them?

00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:26.410
These mysterious things just hint at
all of the things that are going on

00:15:26.434 --> 00:15:29.176
in the minds that are with us on Earth

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.431
that we almost never think about at all.

00:15:34.258 --> 00:15:36.430
At an aquarium in South Africa

00:15:36.454 --> 00:15:39.678
was a little baby bottle-nosed
dolphin named Dolly.

00:15:40.178 --> 00:15:46.322
She was nursing, and one day
a keeper took a cigarette break

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:50.453
and he was looking into the window
into their pool, smoking.

00:15:50.477 --> 00:15:52.851
Dolly came over and looked at him,

00:15:52.875 --> 00:15:56.753
went back to her mother,
nursed for a minute or two,

00:15:56.777 --> 00:15:58.580
came back to the window

00:15:58.604 --> 00:16:04.269
and released a cloud of milk
that enveloped her head like smoke.

00:16:04.293 --> 00:16:07.399
Somehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin

00:16:07.423 --> 00:16:11.712
got the idea of using milk
to represent smoke.

00:16:12.211 --> 00:16:15.559
When human beings use one thing
to represent another,

00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:17.608
we call that art.

00:16:17.632 --> 00:16:19.655
(Laughter)

00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:21.210
The things that make us human

00:16:21.234 --> 00:16:24.314
are not the things
that we think make us human.

00:16:24.781 --> 00:16:27.105
What makes us human is that,

00:16:27.129 --> 00:16:30.265
of all these things that our minds
and their minds have,

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:32.529
we are the most extreme.

00:16:34.347 --> 00:16:36.636
We are the most compassionate,

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.677
most violent, most creative

00:16:39.701 --> 00:16:44.361
and most destructive animal
that has ever been on this planet,

00:16:44.385 --> 00:16:48.109
and we are all of those things
all jumbled up together.

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:53.579
But love is not the thing
that makes us human.

00:16:54.242 --> 00:16:56.594
It's not special to us.

00:16:57.674 --> 00:17:01.645
We are not the only ones
who care about our mates.

00:17:01.669 --> 00:17:05.007
We are not the only ones
who care about our children.

00:17:06.904 --> 00:17:11.874
Albatrosses frequently fly six,
sometimes ten thousand miles

00:17:11.898 --> 00:17:16.385
over several weeks to deliver
one meal, one big meal,

00:17:16.409 --> 00:17:18.385
to their chick who is waiting for them.

00:17:18.835 --> 00:17:23.233
They nest on the most remote islands
in the oceans of the world,

00:17:23.257 --> 00:17:25.630
and this is what it looks like.

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:31.550
Passing life from one generation
to the next is the chain of being.

00:17:31.574 --> 00:17:34.550
If that stops, it all goes away.

00:17:34.975 --> 00:17:39.625
If anything is sacred, that is,
and into that sacred relationship

00:17:39.649 --> 00:17:42.480
comes our plastic trash.

00:17:42.504 --> 00:17:45.191
All of these birds
have plastic in them now.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:50.641
This is an albatross six months old,
ready to fledge --

00:17:50.665 --> 00:17:54.666
died, packed with red cigarette lighters.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.975
This is not the relationship
we are supposed to have

00:17:57.999 --> 00:17:59.585
with the rest of the world.

00:17:59.609 --> 00:18:02.933
But we, who have named
ourselves after our brains,

00:18:04.195 --> 00:18:07.581
never think about the consequences.

00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:12.161
When we welcome new
human life into the world,

00:18:12.185 --> 00:18:16.688
we welcome our babies
into the company of other creatures.

00:18:16.712 --> 00:18:18.805
We paint animals on the walls.

00:18:18.829 --> 00:18:20.657
We don't paint cell phones.

00:18:20.681 --> 00:18:22.824
We don't paint work cubicles.

00:18:22.848 --> 00:18:26.749
We paint animals to show them
that we are not alone.

00:18:27.316 --> 00:18:29.059
We have company.

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:35.267
And every one of those animals
in every painting of Noah's ark,

00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:39.631
deemed worthy of salvation
is in mortal danger now,

00:18:39.655 --> 00:18:41.908
and their flood is us.

00:18:43.704 --> 00:18:46.003
So we started with a question:

00:18:46.027 --> 00:18:47.891
Do they love us?

00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:52.047
We're going to ask another question.

00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:56.609
Are we capable of using what we have

00:18:57.918 --> 00:19:02.091
to care enough to simply
let them continue?

00:19:04.725 --> 00:19:06.066
Thank you very much.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:11.730
(Applause)
