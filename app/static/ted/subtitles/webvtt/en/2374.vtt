00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:05.182
It was April 8, 2003.

00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:10.381
I was in Baghdad,
covering the war in Iraq.

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:15.063
That day, Americans tanks
started arriving in Baghdad.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.333
We were just a few journalists
in the Palestine Hotel,

00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:25.858
and, as happens in war,

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:28.886
the fighting began to approach
outside our windows.

00:00:30.327 --> 00:00:34.525
Baghdad was covered
in black smoke and oil.

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:36.113
It smelled awful.

00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:38.828
We couldn't see a thing,
but we knew what was happening.

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:41.342
Of course, I was supposed
to be writing an article,

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.902
but that's how it always goes --

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:45.564
you're supposed to be writing
and something big happens.

00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:48.315
So I was in my room on the 16th floor,

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.221
writing and looking out the window
every now and then

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:53.029
to see what was happening.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.523
Suddenly, there was a huge explosion.

00:00:55.547 --> 00:00:57.483
During the previous three weeks,

00:00:57.507 --> 00:01:01.626
there had been shelling
with half-ton missiles,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.840
but this time, the shock --

00:01:04.728 --> 00:01:07.225
I felt it inside of me,

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:09.250
and I thought, "It's very close.

00:01:09.274 --> 00:01:11.272
It's very, very close."

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:13.676
So I went down to see what was happening.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.389
I went down to the 15th floor

00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:19.019
to take a look.

00:01:19.043 --> 00:01:22.195
And I saw people, journalists,
screaming in the hallways.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.901
I walked into a room

00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:29.125
and realized that it had
been hit by a missile.

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:32.170
Someone had been wounded.

00:01:33.304 --> 00:01:35.372
There was a man near the window,

00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:38.579
a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk,

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:42.247
lying face-down.

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:50.972
Having worked in a hospital before,
I wanted to help out.

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:52.497
So I turned him over.

00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:54.223
And when I turned him over,

00:01:56.334 --> 00:01:59.485
I noticed that he was open
from sternum to pubis,

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.619
but I couldn't see anything,
nothing at all.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:09.221
All I saw was a white, pearly,
shiny spot that blinded me,

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:11.252
and I didn't understand what was going on.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.531
Once the spot disappeared
and I could see his wound,

00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:16.132
which was very serious,

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:18.251
my buddies and I put a sheet
underneath him,

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:22.060
and we carried him onto an elevator
that stopped at each of the 15 floors.

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:24.960
We put him in a car
that took him to the hospital.

00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:26.746
He died on the way to the hospital.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.760
The Spanish cameraman JosÃ© Couso,
who was on the 14th floor and also hit --

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:35.094
because the shell had exploded
between the two floors --

00:02:35.118 --> 00:02:37.054
died on the operating table.

00:02:37.078 --> 00:02:39.475
As soon as the car left, I went back.

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.832
There was that article
I was supposed to write --

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:43.522
which I had to write.

00:02:44.117 --> 00:02:45.846
And so --

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.768
I returned to the hotel lobby
with my arms covered in blood,

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:55.332
when one of the hotel gofers stopped me

00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:59.203
and asked me to pay the tax
I hadn't paid for 10 days.

00:02:59.227 --> 00:03:01.035
I told him to get lost.

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:05.669
And I said to myself:
"Clear your head, put it all aside.

00:03:07.097 --> 00:03:09.546
If you want to write,
you need to put it all aside."

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.785
And that's what I did.

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.713
I went upstairs, wrote
my article and sent it off.

00:03:15.077 --> 00:03:18.998
Later, aside from the feeling
of having lost my colleagues,

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:22.418
something else was bothering me.

00:03:22.442 --> 00:03:26.209
I kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot,

00:03:28.735 --> 00:03:31.123
and I couldn't understand what it meant.

00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:34.246
And then, the war was over.

00:03:36.572 --> 00:03:42.668
Later, I thought: "That's not possible.
I can't just not know what happened."

00:03:42.692 --> 00:03:46.153
Because it wasn't the first time,
and it didn't only happen to me.

00:03:46.177 --> 00:03:50.082
I have seen things like that
happen to others

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:52.774
in my 20 to 35 years of reporting.

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:56.084
I have seen things
that had an effect on me too.

00:03:56.108 --> 00:03:59.153
For example, there was this man
I knew in Lebanon,

00:03:59.177 --> 00:04:02.083
a 25-year-old veteran
who had been fighting for five years --

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:04.450
a real veteran -- who we would
follow everywhere.

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:07.960
He would crawl in the dark
with confidence --

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:11.143
he was a great soldier, a true soldier --

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:14.524
so we would follow him,
knowing that we would be safe with him.

00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:16.856
And one day, as I was told --

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.476
and I've seen him again since --

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.841
he was back in the camp, playing cards,

00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:22.746
when someone came in next door,

00:04:24.158 --> 00:04:26.294
and discharged their weapon.

00:04:26.318 --> 00:04:27.826
As the gun went off,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.405
that blast, that one shot,
made him duck quickly under the table,

00:04:34.204 --> 00:04:35.418
like a child.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.333
He was shaking, panicking.

00:04:37.357 --> 00:04:42.165
And since then, he has never
been able to get up and fight.

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.881
He ended up working as a croupier

00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:47.027
in a Beirut casino
where I later found him,

00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:49.920
because he couldn't sleep,
so it was quite a suitable job.

00:04:50.378 --> 00:04:52.195
So I thought to myself,

00:04:52.957 --> 00:04:55.218
"What is this thing that can kill you

00:04:56.035 --> 00:05:00.592
without leaving
any visible scars?

00:05:00.974 --> 00:05:02.957
How does that happen?

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.040
What is this unknown thing?"

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:11.573
It was too common to be coincidental.

00:05:11.597 --> 00:05:13.255
So I started to investigate --

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.273
that's all I know how to do.

00:05:15.297 --> 00:05:17.140
I started to investigate

00:05:17.164 --> 00:05:19.711
by looking through books,

00:05:20.836 --> 00:05:23.178
reaching out to psychiatrists,

00:05:23.202 --> 00:05:25.764
going to museums, libraries, etc.

00:05:26.224 --> 00:05:30.323
Finally, I discovered
that some people knew about this --

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.880
often military psychiatrists --

00:05:32.904 --> 00:05:37.793
and that what we were dealing with
was called trauma.

00:05:37.817 --> 00:05:42.643
Americans call it PTSD
or traumatic neurosis.

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:44.532
It was something

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:47.658
that existed,

00:05:48.206 --> 00:05:50.388
but that we never spoke about.

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:53.610
So, this trauma --

00:05:54.452 --> 00:05:55.609
what is it?

00:05:55.633 --> 00:05:58.444
Well, it's an encounter with death.

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:01.928
I don't know if you've ever had
an experience with death --

00:06:01.952 --> 00:06:03.835
I'm not talking about dead bodies,

00:06:03.859 --> 00:06:07.460
or someone's grandfather
lying in a hospital bed,

00:06:07.484 --> 00:06:11.058
or someone who got hit by a car.

00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:16.594
I'm talking about facing
the void of death.

00:06:17.688 --> 00:06:23.861
And that is something
no one is supposed to see.

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:25.727
People used to say,

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:29.726
"Neither the sun, nor death
can be looked at with a steady eye."

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.984
A human being should not
have to face the void of death.

00:06:34.008 --> 00:06:35.849
But when that happens,

00:06:37.801 --> 00:06:41.549
it can remain invisible for a while --

00:06:41.573 --> 00:06:44.341
days, weeks, months, sometimes years.

00:06:44.365 --> 00:06:46.126
And then, at some point,

00:06:47.587 --> 00:06:48.873
it explodes,

00:06:48.897 --> 00:06:52.641
because it's something
that has entered your brain --

00:06:52.665 --> 00:06:57.316
a sort of window between an image
and your mind --

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.665
that has penetrated your brain,

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:04.279
staying there and taking up
all the space inside.

00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:08.190
And there are people --
men, women,

00:07:08.858 --> 00:07:11.496
who suddenly no longer sleep.

00:07:12.376 --> 00:07:14.721
And they experience
horrible anxiety attacks --

00:07:14.745 --> 00:07:17.775
panic attacks, not just minor fears.

00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:20.105
They suddenly don't want to sleep,

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:24.663
because when they do, they have
the same nightmare every night.

00:07:24.687 --> 00:07:26.607
They see the same image every night.

00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:28.258
What type of image?

00:07:28.282 --> 00:07:31.085
For example, a soldier
who enters a building

00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:33.943
and comes face to face
with another soldier aiming at him.

00:07:33.967 --> 00:07:36.530
He looks at the gun,
straight down the barrel.

00:07:36.554 --> 00:07:40.138
And this barrel suddenly
becomes enormous, deformed.

00:07:40.162 --> 00:07:42.916
It becomes fluffy, swallowing everything.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.540
And he says --

00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:48.718
later he will say, "I saw death.

00:07:48.742 --> 00:07:51.243
I saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead."

00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:55.124
And from then on, he knows he is dead.

00:07:55.148 --> 00:08:00.033
It is not a perception --
he is convinced that he is dead.

00:08:00.057 --> 00:08:03.589
In reality, someone came in,
the guy left or didn't shoot, whatever,

00:08:03.613 --> 00:08:05.260
and he didn't actually get shot --

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:06.992
but to him, he died in that moment.

00:08:07.016 --> 00:08:09.123
Or it can be the smell
of a mass grave --

00:08:09.147 --> 00:08:10.952
I saw a lot of that in Rwanda.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.502
It can be the voice of a friend calling,

00:08:15.113 --> 00:08:18.873
and they're being slaughtered
and there's nothing you can do.

00:08:18.897 --> 00:08:20.103
You hear that voice,

00:08:20.127 --> 00:08:25.633
and you wake up every night --
for weeks, months --

00:08:25.657 --> 00:08:28.414
in a trance-like state,
anxious and terrified,

00:08:28.438 --> 00:08:29.793
like a child.

00:08:29.817 --> 00:08:31.396
I have seen men cry --

00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:34.015
just like children --

00:08:34.442 --> 00:08:36.138
from seeing the same image.

00:08:36.162 --> 00:08:40.928
So having that image
of horror in your brain,

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.497
seeing the void of death --

00:08:44.521 --> 00:08:48.226
that analogue of horror
which is hiding something --

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.504
will completely take over.

00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:51.835
You cannot do anything, anything at all.

00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:53.153
You cannot work anymore,

00:08:53.177 --> 00:08:54.460
you cannot love anymore.

00:08:54.484 --> 00:08:56.411
You go home and don't recognize anyone.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:58.442
You don't even recognize yourself.

00:09:01.181 --> 00:09:04.705
You hide and don't leave the house,
you lock yourself in, you become ill.

00:09:04.729 --> 00:09:09.143
I know people who placed small cans
outside their house with coins inside,

00:09:09.167 --> 00:09:11.033
in case someone tried to get in.

00:09:11.057 --> 00:09:13.929
All of a sudden, you feel
like you want to die or kill

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:15.501
or hide or run away.

00:09:15.525 --> 00:09:17.676
You want to be loved,
but you hate everyone.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.613
It's a feeling that seizes you entirely

00:09:22.644 --> 00:09:24.375
day in and day out,

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:28.303
and you suffer tremendously.

00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:30.828
And no one understands.

00:09:30.852 --> 00:09:34.620
They say, "There's nothing wrong with you.
You seem fine, you have no injuries.

00:09:34.644 --> 00:09:37.138
You went to war, came back; you're fine."

00:09:38.231 --> 00:09:40.113
These people suffer tremendously.

00:09:40.137 --> 00:09:41.716
Some commit suicide.

00:09:42.035 --> 00:09:44.749
After all, suicide is like updating
your daily planner --

00:09:44.773 --> 00:09:47.084
I'm already dead,
I might as well commit suicide.

00:09:47.108 --> 00:09:49.043
Plus, there is no more pain.

00:09:49.067 --> 00:09:53.097
Some commit suicide,
others end up under the bridge, drinking.

00:09:53.121 --> 00:09:57.493
Everyone remembers
that grandfather or uncle or neighbor

00:09:57.517 --> 00:09:59.487
who used to drink, never said a word,

00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:01.280
always in a bad mood, beat his wife

00:10:01.304 --> 00:10:05.433
and who would end up either sinking
into alcoholism or dying.

00:10:05.457 --> 00:10:08.237
And why do we not talk about this?

00:10:08.261 --> 00:10:11.380
We don't talk about it because it's taboo.

00:10:12.157 --> 00:10:15.924
It's not like we don't have the words
to express the void of death.

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:17.716
But others don't want hear it.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.854
The first time I returned
from an assignment,

00:10:19.878 --> 00:10:21.404
They said, "Oh! He's back."

00:10:21.428 --> 00:10:24.524
There was a fancy dinner --
white tablecloth, candles, guests.

00:10:24.548 --> 00:10:25.740
"Tell us everything!"

00:10:25.764 --> 00:10:27.087
Which I did.

00:10:28.075 --> 00:10:30.559
After 20 minutes, people
were giving me dirty looks,

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:32.588
the hostess had her nose in the ashtray.

00:10:32.612 --> 00:10:35.583
It was horrible and I realized
I ruined the whole evening.

00:10:35.607 --> 00:10:37.516
So I don't talk about it anymore.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.081
We're just not ready to listen.

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.833
People say outright: "Please, stop."

00:10:40.857 --> 00:10:42.954
Is that a rare occurrence?

00:10:42.978 --> 00:10:45.380
No, it's extremely common.

00:10:45.404 --> 00:10:47.557
One third of the soldiers
who died in Iraq --

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.103
well, not "died," let me re-phrase that --

00:10:50.127 --> 00:10:53.267
one third of the US soldiers
who went to Iraq

00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:54.929
suffer from PTSD.

00:10:54.953 --> 00:11:00.874
In 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers
from the First World War

00:11:00.898 --> 00:11:04.273
that were being treated
in British psychiatric hospitals.

00:11:05.066 --> 00:11:07.500
In Vietnam, 54,000 people died --

00:11:07.524 --> 00:11:08.867
Americans.

00:11:08.891 --> 00:11:13.064
In 1987, the US government
identified 102,000 --

00:11:13.088 --> 00:11:14.302
twice as many --

00:11:14.326 --> 00:11:16.950
102,000 veterans who died
from committing suicide.

00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:19.790
Twice as many deaths by suicide
than by combat in Vietnam.

00:11:19.814 --> 00:11:22.972
So you see, this relates to everything,

00:11:22.996 --> 00:11:25.335
not just modern warfare,
but also ancient wars --

00:11:25.359 --> 00:11:28.358
you can read about it,
the evidence is there.

00:11:28.382 --> 00:11:30.627
So why do we not talk about it?

00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:33.096
Why have we not talked about it?

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.588
The problem is that
if you don't talk about it,

00:11:38.642 --> 00:11:40.237
you're heading for disaster.

00:11:41.528 --> 00:11:44.343
The only way to heal --

00:11:44.367 --> 00:11:47.565
and the good news here
is that this is treatable --

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:50.900
think Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. --

00:11:50.924 --> 00:11:52.209
it's indeed treatable.

00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:56.793
The only way to heal from this trauma,

00:11:56.817 --> 00:12:01.873
from this encounter with death
that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you

00:12:01.897 --> 00:12:05.897
is to find a way to express it.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.279
People used to say,

00:12:08.303 --> 00:12:11.870
"Language is the only thing
that holds all of us together."

00:12:11.894 --> 00:12:14.235
Without language, we're nothing.

00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:16.876
It's the thing that makes us human.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.877
In the face of such a horrible image --

00:12:18.901 --> 00:12:24.427
a wordless image of oblivion
that obsesses us --

00:12:24.451 --> 00:12:26.910
the only way to cope with it

00:12:28.109 --> 00:12:30.210
is to put human words to it.

00:12:30.234 --> 00:12:32.660
Because these people
feel excluded from humanity.

00:12:32.684 --> 00:12:35.890
No one wants to see them anymore
and they don't want to see anyone.

00:12:35.914 --> 00:12:38.335
They feel dirty, defiled, ashamed.

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:41.603
Someone said, "Doctor,
I don't use the subway anymore

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:44.841
because I'm afraid people
will see the horror in my eyes."

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:47.731
Another guy thought he had
a terrible skin disease

00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:51.592
and spent six months with dermatologists,
going from doctor to doctor.

00:12:51.616 --> 00:12:54.155
And then one day, they sent him
to a psychiatrist.

00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:56.584
During his second session,
he told the psychiatrist

00:12:56.608 --> 00:12:58.938
he had a terrible skin disease
from head to toe.

00:12:58.962 --> 00:13:01.881
The psychiatrist asked,
"Why are you in this state?"

00:13:01.905 --> 00:13:05.231
And the man said, "Well, because
I'm dead, so I must be rotting away."

00:13:05.255 --> 00:13:09.668
So you see this is something
that has a profound effect on people.

00:13:09.692 --> 00:13:12.101
In order to heal,
we need to talk about it.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:16.069
The horror needs to be put into words --

00:13:16.093 --> 00:13:20.276
human words, so we can organize it
and talk about it again.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.442
We have to look death in the face.

00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:30.156
And if we can do that,
if we can talk about these things,

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.605
then step by step,
by working it out verbally,

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:36.557
we can reclaim our place in humanity.

00:13:37.549 --> 00:13:38.813
And it is important.

00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:40.525
Silence kills us.

00:13:41.789 --> 00:13:43.211
So what does this mean?

00:13:43.235 --> 00:13:45.251
It means that after a trauma,

00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:48.910
without question, we lose
our "unbearable lightness of being,"

00:13:48.934 --> 00:13:51.688
that sense of immortality
that keeps us here --

00:13:51.712 --> 00:13:55.624
meaning, if we're here, we almost feel
like we're immortal, which we're not,

00:13:55.648 --> 00:13:58.991
but if we didn't believe that,
we'd say, "What's the point of it all?"

00:13:59.015 --> 00:14:01.805
But trauma survivors have lost
that feeling of immortality.

00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:03.224
They've lost their lightness.

00:14:03.248 --> 00:14:04.987
But they have found something else.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:08.271
So this means that if we manage
to look death in the face,

00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:14.448
and actually confront it,
rather than keep quiet and hide,

00:14:14.472 --> 00:14:16.951
like some of the men or women I know did,

00:14:16.975 --> 00:14:23.629
such as Michael from Rwanda,
Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo

00:14:23.653 --> 00:14:24.879
and other people I know,

00:14:24.903 --> 00:14:27.001
like Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer,

00:14:27.025 --> 00:14:29.316
who gave up field assignments
after a trauma.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.558
Five friends of mine committed suicide,

00:14:31.582 --> 00:14:34.158
they're the ones
who did not survive the trauma.

00:14:34.182 --> 00:14:39.728
So if we can look death in the face,

00:14:39.752 --> 00:14:42.530
if we, mortal humans, human mortals,

00:14:42.554 --> 00:14:45.395
understand that we are human
and mortal, mortal and human,

00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:51.666
if we can confront death
and identify it once again

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.753
as the most mysterious place
of all mysterious places,

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.126
since no one has ever seen it --

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.813
if we can give it back this meaning,

00:15:00.837 --> 00:15:03.678
yes, we may die,

00:15:05.686 --> 00:15:07.281
survive

00:15:08.011 --> 00:15:09.438
and come back to life,

00:15:09.462 --> 00:15:12.555
but we'll come back stronger than before.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:13.889
Much stronger.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.067
Thank you.

00:15:15.091 --> 00:15:16.858
(Applause)
