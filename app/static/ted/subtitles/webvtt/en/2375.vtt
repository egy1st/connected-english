00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.858
For much of the past century,

00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:05.690
architecture was under the spell
of a famous doctrine.

00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:09.991
"Form follows function" had become
modernity's ambitious manifesto

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:12.268
and detrimental straitjacket,

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:15.261
as it liberated architecture
from the decorative,

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:19.186
but condemned it to utilitarian rigor
and restrained purpose.

00:00:20.418 --> 00:00:23.124
Of course, architecture is about function,

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:26.815
but I want to remember a rewriting
of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi,

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.552
and I want to propose
a completely different quality.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.113
If form follows fiction,

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:37.739
we could think of architecture
and buildings as a space of stories --

00:00:37.763 --> 00:00:40.243
stories of the people that live there,

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:42.622
of the people that work
in these buildings.

00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:47.103
And we could start to imagine
the experiences our buildings create.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.568
In this sense, I'm interested in fiction

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:54.170
not as the implausible but as the real,

00:00:54.194 --> 00:00:56.192
as the reality of what architecture means

00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:58.564
for the people that live
in it and with it.

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:03.265
Our buildings are prototypes,
ideas for how the space of living

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.617
or how the space of working
could be different,

00:01:06.728 --> 00:01:10.229
and what a space of culture
or a space of media could look like today.

00:01:11.246 --> 00:01:13.326
Our buildings are real;
they're being built.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.209
They're an explicit engagement
in physical reality

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:18.361
and conceptual possibility.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:23.767
I think of our architecture
as organizational structures.

00:01:24.276 --> 00:01:27.904
At their core is indeed
structural thinking, like a system:

00:01:27.928 --> 00:01:31.079
How can we arrange things
in both a functional

00:01:31.103 --> 00:01:32.868
and experiential way?

00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:36.856
How can we create structures
that generate a series

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.299
of relationships and narratives?

00:01:39.672 --> 00:01:41.263
And how can fictive stories

00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:44.101
of the inhabitants and users
of our buildings

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:46.077
script the architecture,

00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:49.468
while the architecture scripts
those stories at the same time?

00:01:50.428 --> 00:01:52.413
And here comes the second term into play,

00:01:52.437 --> 00:01:54.675
what I call "narrative hybrids" --

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:57.444
structures of multiple
simultaneous stories

00:01:57.468 --> 00:02:00.198
that unfold throughout
the buildings we create.

00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:05.566
So we could think of architecture
as complex systems of relationships,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.406
both in a programmatic and functional way

00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:13.401
and in an experiential
and emotive or social way.

00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:17.934
This is the headquarters
for China's national broadcaster,

00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.099
which I designed together
with Rem Koolhaas at OMA.

00:02:21.882 --> 00:02:26.021
When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002,
the city planners showed us this image:

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.212
a forest of several hundred skyscrapers

00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:30.307
to emerge in the central
business district,

00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:32.952
except at that time,
only a handful of them existed.

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.652
So we had to design in a context
that we knew almost nothing about,

00:02:36.676 --> 00:02:39.771
except one thing:
it would all be about verticality.

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:45.145
Of course, the skyscraper is vertical --
it's a profoundly hierarchical structure,

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.585
the top always the best,
the bottom the worst,

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.772
and the taller you are,
the better, so it seems.

00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:53.170
And we wanted to ask ourselves,

00:02:53.194 --> 00:02:55.987
could a building be about
a completely different quality?

00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:59.964
Could it undo this hierarchy,
and could it be about a system

00:02:59.988 --> 00:03:03.212
that is more about collaboration,
rather than isolation?

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:06.290
So we took this needle
and bent it back into itself,

00:03:06.314 --> 00:03:09.167
into a loop of interconnected activities.

00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:13.145
Our idea was to bring all aspects
of television-making

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.156
into one single structure: news,
program production, broadcasting,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.402
research and training, administration --

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:23.094
all into a circuit
of interconnected activities

00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:27.031
where people would meet in a process
of exchange and collaboration.

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.777
I still very much like this image.

00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:32.924
It reminds one of biology classes,
if you remember the human body

00:03:32.948 --> 00:03:35.852
with all its organs
and circulatory systems, like at school.

00:03:35.876 --> 00:03:39.873
And suddenly you think of architecture
no longer as built substance,

00:03:39.897 --> 00:03:41.999
but as an organism, as a life form.

00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:44.783
And as you start to dissect this organism,

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:49.536
you can identify a series
of primary technical clusters --

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.254
program production,
broadcasting center and news.

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:56.337
Those are tightly intertwined
with social clusters:

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:59.425
meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas --

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.533
informal spaces for people
to meet and exchange.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.498
So the organizational structure
of this building was a hybrid

00:04:07.522 --> 00:04:09.968
between the technical and the social,

00:04:09.992 --> 00:04:11.826
the human and the performative.

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:15.973
And of course, we used the loop
of the building as a circulatory system,

00:04:15.997 --> 00:04:19.906
to thread everything together
and to allow both visitors and staff

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.515
to experience all these different
functions in a great unity.

00:04:25.118 --> 00:04:28.178
With 473,000 square meters,

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:31.213
it is one of the largest buildings
ever built in the world.

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:33.905
It has a population of over 10,000 people,

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:37.515
and of course, this is a scale
that exceeds the comprehension

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.299
of many things and the scale
of typical architecture.

00:04:40.323 --> 00:04:41.951
So we stopped work for a while

00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:46.280
and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks
and glued them onto a model,

00:04:46.304 --> 00:04:50.327
just simply to confront ourselves
with what that quantity actually meant.

00:04:51.261 --> 00:04:52.871
But of course, it's not a number,

00:04:52.895 --> 00:04:57.504
it is the people, it is a community
that inhabits the building,

00:04:57.528 --> 00:05:01.981
and in order to both comprehend
this, but also script this architecture,

00:05:02.005 --> 00:05:05.251
we identified five characters,
hypothetical characters,

00:05:05.275 --> 00:05:09.844
and we followed them throughout their day
in a life in this building,

00:05:09.868 --> 00:05:12.751
thought of where they would meet,
what they would experience.

00:05:12.775 --> 00:05:15.914
So it was a way to script and design
the building, but of course,

00:05:15.938 --> 00:05:17.975
also to communicate its experiences.

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:21.287
This was part of an exhibition
with the Museum of Modern Art

00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:23.619
in both New York and Beijing.

00:05:24.865 --> 00:05:27.064
This is the main broadcast control room,

00:05:27.088 --> 00:05:28.906
a technical installation so large,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.262
it can broadcast over 200
channels simultaneously.

00:05:33.643 --> 00:05:37.063
And this is how the building
stands in Beijing today.

00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:41.095
Its first broadcast live
was the London Olympics 2012,

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:45.174
after it had been completed
from the outside for the Beijing Olympics.

00:05:45.998 --> 00:05:50.061
And you can see at the very tip
of this 75-meter cantilever,

00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:51.639
those three little circles.

00:05:51.663 --> 00:05:55.164
And they're indeed part of a public loop
that goes through the building.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.740
They're a piece of glass
that you can stand on

00:05:57.764 --> 00:06:01.867
and watch the city pass by
below you in slow motion.

00:06:03.524 --> 00:06:06.774
The building has become
part of everyday life in Beijing.

00:06:06.798 --> 00:06:08.289
It is there.

00:06:08.313 --> 00:06:11.401
It has also become a very popular backdrop

00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:12.910
for wedding photography.

00:06:12.934 --> 00:06:15.796
(Laughter)

00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:21.595
But its most important moment
is maybe sill this one.

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:23.673
"That's Beijing" is similar to "Time Out,"

00:06:23.697 --> 00:06:28.547
a magazine that broadcasts what
is happening in town during the week,

00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:33.534
and suddenly you see the building
portrayed no longer as physical matter,

00:06:33.558 --> 00:06:35.073
but actually as an urban actor,

00:06:35.097 --> 00:06:39.786
as part of a series of personas
that define the life of the city.

00:06:40.987 --> 00:06:45.897
So architecture suddenly
assumes the quality of a player,

00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:49.844
of something that writes stories
and performs stories.

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:54.931
And I think that could be one
of its primary meanings

00:06:54.955 --> 00:06:56.202
that we believe in.

00:06:56.226 --> 00:06:58.837
But of course, there's another
story to this building.

00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:01.790
It is the story of the people
that made it --

00:07:01.814 --> 00:07:04.632
400 engineers and architects
that I was guiding

00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:07.247
over almost a decade of collaborative work

00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:10.238
that we spent together
in scripting this building,

00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:12.168
in imagining its reality

00:07:12.192 --> 00:07:15.483
and ultimately getting it built in China.

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:22.093
This is a residential development
in Singapore, large scale.

00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:26.771
If we look at Singapore like most of Asia
and more and more of the world,

00:07:26.795 --> 00:07:30.342
of course, it is dominated by the tower,

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:34.887
a typology that indeed creates
more isolation than connectedness,

00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:38.122
and I wanted to ask, how
could we think about living,

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:41.971
not only in terms of the privacy
and individuality of ourselves

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:43.431
and our apartment,

00:07:43.455 --> 00:07:46.091
but in an idea of a collective?

00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:49.514
How could we think about creating
a communal environment

00:07:49.538 --> 00:07:53.426
in which sharing things was as great
as having your own?

00:07:54.664 --> 00:07:59.360
The typical answer to the question --
we had to design 1,040 apartments --

00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:00.741
would have looked like this:

00:08:00.765 --> 00:08:03.511
24-story height limit given
by the planning authorities,

00:08:03.535 --> 00:08:07.509
12 towers with nothing
but residual in between --

00:08:07.533 --> 00:08:10.446
a very tight system that,
although the tower isolates you,

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.977
it doesn't even give you privacy,
because you're so close to the next one,

00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:17.291
that it is very questionable
what the qualities of this would be.

00:08:18.488 --> 00:08:22.782
So I proposed to topple the towers,
throw the vertical into the horizontal

00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:24.596
and stack them up,

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.167
and what looks a bit random from the side,

00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:29.985
if you look from the viewpoint
of the helicopter,

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:34.738
you can see its organizational structure
is actually a hexagonal grid,

00:08:34.762 --> 00:08:38.499
in which these horizontal
building blocks are stacked up

00:08:38.523 --> 00:08:43.592
to create huge outdoor courtyards --
central spaces for the community,

00:08:43.616 --> 00:08:46.972
programmed with a variety
of amenities and functions.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.087
And you see that these courtyards
are not hermetically sealed spaces.

00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:53.603
They're open, permeable;
they're interconnected.

00:08:53.627 --> 00:08:55.851
We called the project "The Interlace,"

00:08:55.875 --> 00:08:58.849
thinking that we interlace
and interconnect

00:08:58.873 --> 00:09:01.788
the human beings and the spaces alike.

00:09:02.502 --> 00:09:05.393
And the detailed quality
of everything we designed

00:09:05.417 --> 00:09:09.249
was about animating the space
and giving the space to the inhabitants.

00:09:09.273 --> 00:09:10.670
And, in fact, it was a system

00:09:10.694 --> 00:09:14.162
where we would layer
primarily communal spaces,

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:18.146
stacked to more and more
individual and private spaces.

00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:20.505
So we would open up a spectrum

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:23.719
between the collective and the individual.

00:09:24.203 --> 00:09:25.354
A little piece of math:

00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:27.929
if we count all the green
that we left on the ground,

00:09:27.953 --> 00:09:30.038
minus the footprint of the buildings,

00:09:30.062 --> 00:09:33.489
and we would add back
the green of all the terraces,

00:09:33.513 --> 00:09:35.567
we have 112 percent green space,

00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:38.074
so more nature than not
having built a building.

00:09:38.463 --> 00:09:42.465
And of course this little piece of math
shows you that we are multiplying

00:09:42.489 --> 00:09:45.346
the space available
to those who live there.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.014
This is, in fact, the 13th floor
of one of these terraces.

00:09:49.038 --> 00:09:53.657
So you see new datum planes,
new grounds planes for social activity.

00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:57.730
We paid a lot of attention
to sustainability.

00:09:58.212 --> 00:10:01.791
In the tropics, the sun is the most
important thing to pay attention to,

00:10:01.815 --> 00:10:04.877
and, in fact, it is seeking
protection from the sun.

00:10:04.901 --> 00:10:08.038
We first proved that all apartments
would have sufficient daylight

00:10:08.062 --> 00:10:09.235
through the year.

00:10:09.648 --> 00:10:12.309
We then went on to optimize
the glazing of the facades

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:14.902
to minimize the energy
consumption of the building.

00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:19.396
But most importantly, we could prove
that through the geometry

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.996
of the building design,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.382
the building itself would provide
sufficient shading to the courtyards

00:10:24.406 --> 00:10:27.408
so that those would be usable
throughout the entire year.

00:10:27.432 --> 00:10:30.910
We further placed water bodies
along the prevailing wind corridors,

00:10:30.934 --> 00:10:34.654
so that evaporative cooling
would create microclimates

00:10:34.678 --> 00:10:38.163
that, again, would enhance
the quality of those spaces

00:10:38.187 --> 00:10:40.598
available for the inhabitants.

00:10:41.773 --> 00:10:45.519
And it was the idea of creating
this variety of choices,

00:10:45.543 --> 00:10:49.616
of freedom to think
where you would want to be,

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.544
where you would want to escape, maybe,

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:55.386
within the own complexity
of the complex in which you live.

00:10:57.036 --> 00:10:59.076
But coming from Asia to Europe:

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.956
a building for a German
media company based in Berlin,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.400
transitioning from the traditional
print media to the digital media.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.694
And its CEO asked a few
very pertinent questions:

00:11:11.146 --> 00:11:13.751
Why would anyone today
still want to go to the office,

00:11:13.775 --> 00:11:15.964
because you can actually work anywhere?

00:11:15.988 --> 00:11:19.861
And how could a digital identity
of a company be embodied

00:11:19.885 --> 00:11:21.036
in a building?

00:11:22.147 --> 00:11:25.970
We created not only an object,
but at the center of this object

00:11:25.994 --> 00:11:27.589
we created a giant space,

00:11:27.613 --> 00:11:31.287
and this space was about
the experience of a collective,

00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:34.178
the experience of collaboration
and of togetherness.

00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:38.626
Communication, interaction
as the center of a space

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.189
that in itself would float,

00:11:41.213 --> 00:11:43.325
like what we call the collaborative cloud,

00:11:43.349 --> 00:11:44.857
in the middle of the building,

00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:48.269
surrounded by an envelope
of standard modular offices.

00:11:48.944 --> 00:11:52.094
So with only a few steps
from your quiet work desk,

00:11:52.118 --> 00:11:55.845
you could participate
in the giant collective experience

00:11:55.869 --> 00:11:57.498
of the central space.

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:03.738
Finally, we come to London,
a project commissioned

00:12:03.762 --> 00:12:06.340
by the London Legacy
Development Corporation

00:12:06.364 --> 00:12:07.793
of the Mayor of London.

00:12:08.309 --> 00:12:10.497
We were asked to undertake a study

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:13.313
and investigate the potential of a site

00:12:13.337 --> 00:12:15.808
out in Stratford in the Olympic Park.

00:12:16.229 --> 00:12:19.813
In the 19th century, Prince Albert
had created Albertopolis.

00:12:20.513 --> 00:12:24.251
And Boris Johnson thought
of creating Olympicopolis.

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:29.483
The idea was to bring together
some of Britain's greatest institutions,

00:12:29.507 --> 00:12:33.367
some international ones,
and to create a new system of synergies.

00:12:33.803 --> 00:12:38.327
Prince Albert, as yet, created
Albertopolis in the 19th century,

00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:40.814
thought of showcasing
all achievements of mankind,

00:12:40.838 --> 00:12:43.638
bringing arts and science closer together.

00:12:44.082 --> 00:12:48.756
And he built Exhibition Road,
a linear sequence of those institutions.

00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:53.527
But of course, today's society
has moved on from there.

00:12:53.551 --> 00:12:55.507
We no longer live in a world

00:12:55.531 --> 00:12:58.211
in which everything
is as clearly delineated

00:12:58.235 --> 00:12:59.737
or separated from each other.

00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:03.150
We live in a world in which
boundaries start to blur

00:13:03.174 --> 00:13:04.642
between the different domains,

00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:08.656
and in which collaboration and interaction
becomes far more important

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.464
than keeping separations.

00:13:11.408 --> 00:13:14.427
So we wanted to think
of a giant culture machine,

00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:19.228
a building that would orchestrate
and animate the various domains,

00:13:19.252 --> 00:13:22.306
but allow them to interact
and collaborate.

00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:25.316
At the base of it is a very simple module,

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.491
a ring module.

00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:30.158
It can function as a double-loaded
corridor, has daylight, has ventilation.

00:13:30.182 --> 00:13:31.333
It can be glazed over

00:13:31.357 --> 00:13:34.230
and turned into a giant
exhibitional performance space.

00:13:34.254 --> 00:13:36.379
These modules were stacked together

00:13:36.403 --> 00:13:40.165
with the idea that almost any
function could, over time,

00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:41.926
occupy any of these modules.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.066
So institutions could shrink or contract,

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.811
as, of course, the future of culture
is, in a way, the most uncertain of all.

00:13:50.733 --> 00:13:53.688
This is how the building sits,
adjacent to the Aquatics Centre,

00:13:53.712 --> 00:13:55.663
opposite the Olympic Stadium.

00:13:56.608 --> 00:13:58.941
And you can see how
its cantilevering volumes

00:13:58.965 --> 00:14:01.755
project out and engage the public space

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:05.480
and how its courtyards
animate the public inside.

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:10.541
The idea was to create a complex system

00:14:10.565 --> 00:14:15.453
in which institutional entities
could maintain their own identity,

00:14:15.477 --> 00:14:18.410
in which they would not
be subsumed in a singular volume.

00:14:18.434 --> 00:14:21.600
Here's a scale comparison
to the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

00:14:21.624 --> 00:14:24.989
It both shows the enormous scale
and potential of the project,

00:14:25.013 --> 00:14:26.300
but also the difference:

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:30.499
here, it is a multiplicity
of a heterogeneous structure,

00:14:30.523 --> 00:14:33.034
in which different entities can interact

00:14:33.058 --> 00:14:35.517
without losing their own identity.

00:14:36.395 --> 00:14:40.345
And it was this thought: to create
an organizational structure

00:14:40.369 --> 00:14:43.202
that would allow for multiple
narratives to be scripted --

00:14:43.226 --> 00:14:48.680
for those in the educational parts
that create and think culture;

00:14:48.704 --> 00:14:52.210
for those that present
the visual arts, the dance;

00:14:52.234 --> 00:14:55.043
and for the public to be
admitted into all of this

00:14:55.067 --> 00:14:57.713
with a series of possible trajectories,

00:14:57.737 --> 00:15:00.469
to script their own reading
of these narratives

00:15:00.493 --> 00:15:02.126
and their own experience.

00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:07.881
And I want to end on a project
that is very small,

00:15:07.905 --> 00:15:09.158
in a way, very different:

00:15:09.896 --> 00:15:11.944
a floating cinema
in the ocean of Thailand.

00:15:11.968 --> 00:15:15.504
Friends of mine had founded
a film festival,

00:15:15.528 --> 00:15:16.718
and I thought,

00:15:17.226 --> 00:15:20.505
if we think of the stories
and narratives of movies,

00:15:20.529 --> 00:15:24.072
we should also think of the narratives
of the people that watch them.

00:15:24.096 --> 00:15:27.381
So I designed a small
modular floating platform,

00:15:27.405 --> 00:15:29.679
based on the techniques
of local fishermen,

00:15:29.703 --> 00:15:31.790
how they built their lobster
and fish farms.

00:15:31.814 --> 00:15:34.193
We collaborated with the local community

00:15:34.217 --> 00:15:37.949
and built, out of recycled
materials of their own,

00:15:37.973 --> 00:15:40.095
this fantastical floating platform

00:15:40.119 --> 00:15:42.040
that gently moved in the ocean

00:15:42.064 --> 00:15:44.948
as we watched films
from the British film archive,

00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:47.638
[1903] "Alice in Wonderland," for example.

00:15:47.987 --> 00:15:51.044
The most primordial
experiences of the audience

00:15:51.068 --> 00:15:54.133
merged with the stories of the movies.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.650
So I believe that architecture exceeds
the domain of physical matter,

00:16:00.674 --> 00:16:02.134
of the built environment,

00:16:02.158 --> 00:16:05.347
but is really about how
we want to live our lives,

00:16:05.371 --> 00:16:08.433
how we script our own stories
and those of others.

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.036
Thank you.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.473
(Applause)
