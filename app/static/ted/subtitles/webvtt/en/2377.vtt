00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.600
There's something about caves --

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.840
a shadowy opening in a limestone
cliff that draws you in.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.456
As you pass through the portal
between light and dark,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.015
you enter a subterranean world --

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.720
a place of perpetual gloom,
of earthy smells, of hushed silence.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.136
Long ago in Europe,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.616
ancient people also entered
these underground worlds.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.056
As witness to their passage,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.735
they left behind mysterious
engravings and paintings,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.320
like this panel of humans, triangles
and zigzags from Ojo GuareÃ±a in Spain.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.160
You now walk the same path
as these early artists.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.816
And in this surreal, otherworldly place,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.736
it's almost possible to imagine

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.296
that you hear the muffled footfall
of skin boots on soft earth,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.480
or that you see the flickering of a torch
around the next bend.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.976
When I'm in a cave,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.096
I often find myself wondering
what drove these people to go so deep

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.816
to brave dangerous and narrow
passageways to leave their mark?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.056
In this video clip,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.456
that was shot half a kilometer,
or about a third of a mile, underground,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.616
in the cave of Cudon in Spain,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.096
we found a series
of red paintings on a ceiling

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.056
in a previously unexplored
section of the cave.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.736
As we crawled forward, military-style,
with the ceiling getting ever lower,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.976
we finally got to a point
where the ceiling was so low

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.256
that my husband
and project photographer, Dylan,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.416
could no longer achieve focus
on the ceiling with his DSLR camera.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.096
So while he filmed me,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.416
I kept following the trail of red paint
with a single light

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.760
and a point-and-shoot camera
that we kept for that type of occasion.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.061
Half a kilometer underground.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.816
Seriously.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.840
What was somebody doing down there
with a torch or a stone lamp?

00:01:52.864 --> 00:01:54.056
(Laughter)

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.976
I mean -- me, it makes sense, right?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.216
But you know,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.056
this is the kind of question that
I'm trying to answer with my research.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.760
I study some of the oldest
art in the world.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.856
It was created by these
early artists in Europe,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.960
between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.696
And the thing is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.216
that I'm not just studying it
because it's beautiful,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.717
though some of it certainly is.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.496
But what I'm interested in
is the development of the modern mind,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.456
of the evolution of creativity,
of imagination, of abstract thought,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.600
about what it means to be human.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.296
While all species communicate
in one way or another,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.896
only we humans have really
taken it to another level.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.496
Our desire and ability
to share and collaborate

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.176
has been a huge part of our success story.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.016
Our modern world is based on a global
network of information exchange

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.056
made possible, in large part,
by our ability to communicate --

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.080
in particular, using graphic
or written forms of communication.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.776
The thing is, though,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.336
that we've been building
on the mental achievements

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.416
of those that came before us for so long

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.840
that it's easy to forget that certain
abilities haven't already existed.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.136
It's one of the things
I find most fascinating

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.736
about studying our deep history.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.856
Those people didn't have the shoulders
of any giants to stand on.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.336
They were the original shoulders.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.256
And while a surprising number
of important inventions

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.176
come out of that distant time,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.880
what I want to talk to you about today
is the invention of graphic communication.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.856
There are three
main types of communication,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.256
spoken, gestural --
so things like sign language --

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.576
and graphic communication.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.256
Spoken and gestural are
by their very nature ephemeral.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.216
It requires close contact
for a message to be sent and received.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.176
And after the moment
of transmission, it's gone forever.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.176
Graphic communication, on the other hand,
decouples that relationship.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.176
And with its invention,
it became possible for the first time

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.056
for a message to be
transmitted and preserved

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.776
beyond a single moment in place and time.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.576
Europe is one of the first places

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.296
that we start to see graphic marks
regularly appearing

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.560
in caves, rock shelters
and even a few surviving open-air sites.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.776
But this is not the Europe we know today.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.776
This was a world dominated
by towering ice sheets,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.776
three to four kilometers high,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.056
with sweeping grass plains
and frozen tundra.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.120
This was the Ice Age.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.376
Over the last century,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.696
more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites
have been found across the continent,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.096
decorated with animals, abstract shapes
and even the occasional human

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.736
like these engraved figures
from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.816
They provide us with a rare glimpse

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.920
into the creative world and imagination
of these early artists.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.216
Since their discovery,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.640
it's been the animals that have received
the majority of the study

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.760
like this black horse
from Cullalvera in Spain,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.680
or this unusual purple bison
from La Pasiega.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.256
But for me, it was the abstract shapes,
what we call geometric signs,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.880
that drew me to study the art.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.536
The funny this is that at most sites

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.056
the geometric signs far outnumber
the animal and human images.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.256
But when I started on this back in 2007,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.256
there wasn't even a definitive list
of how many shapes there were,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.616
nor was there a strong sense

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.520
of whether the same ones
appeared across space or time.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.216
Before I could even
get started on my questions,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.336
my first step was to compile a database

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.256
of all known geometric signs
from all of the rock art sites.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.856
The problem was that while they were
well documented at some sites,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.176
usually the ones
with the very nice animals,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.856
there was also a large number of them
where it was very vague --

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.136
there wasn't a lot
of description or detail.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.496
Some of them hadn't been visited
in half a century or more.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.936
These were the ones
that I targeted for my field work.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.816
Over the course of two years,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.056
my faithful husband Dylan and I
each spent over 300 hours underground,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.056
hiking, crawling and wriggling
around 52 sites

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.016
in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.896
And it was totally worth it.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.656
We found new, undocumented geometric signs
at 75 percent of the sites we visited.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.496
This is the level of accuracy
I knew I was going to need

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.696
if I wanted to start answering
those larger questions.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.296
So let's get to those answers.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.936
Barring a handful of outliers,
there are only 32 geometric signs.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.776
Only 32 signs

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.280
across a 30,000-year time span
and the entire continent of Europe.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.296
That is a very small number.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.776
Now, if these were random
doodles or decorations,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.216
we would expect to see
a lot more variation,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.656
but instead what we find
are the same signs

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.120
repeating across both space and time.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.816
Some signs start out strong,
before losing popularity and vanishing,

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.176
while other signs are later inventions.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.816
But 65 percent of those signs stayed
in use during that entire time period --

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.136
things like lines, rectangles
triangles, ovals and circles

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.303
like we see here
from the end of the Ice Age,

00:07:15.327 --> 00:07:19.256
at a 10,000-year-old site
high in the Pyrenees Mountains.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.496
And while certain signs
span thousands of kilometers,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.496
other signs had much more
restricted distribution patterns,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.936
with some being limited
to a single territory,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.136
like we see here
with these divided rectangles

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.376
that are only found in northern Spain,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.456
and which some researchers have speculated

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.800
could be some sort
of family or clan signs.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.256
On a side note,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.696
there is surprising degree
of similarity in the earliest rock art

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.296
found all the way from France and Spain
to Indonesia and Australia.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.616
With many of the same signs
appearing in such far-flung places,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.616
especially in that 30,000
to 40,000-year range,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.496
it's starting to seem increasingly likely

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.376
that this invention actually traces back
to a common point of origin in Africa.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.016
But that I'm afraid,
is a subject for a future talk.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.856
So back to the matter at hand.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.856
There could be no doubt that these signs
were meaningful to their creators,

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.696
like these 25,000-year-old
bas-relief sculptures

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.336
from La Roque de Venasque in France.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.760
We might not know what they meant,
but the people of the time certainly did.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.816
The repetition of the same signs,
for so long, and at so many sites

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.320
tells us that the artists
were making intentional choices.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.176
If we're talking about geometric shapes,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.936
with specific, culturally recognized,
agreed-upon meanings,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.616
than we could very well be looking

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.176
at one of the oldest systems
of graphic communication in the world.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.096
I'm not talking about writing yet.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.456
There's just not enough
characters at this point

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.336
to have represented all of the words
in the spoken language,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.176
something which is a requirement
for a full writing system.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.576
Nor do we see the signs
repeating regularly enough

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.256
to suggest that they were
some sort of alphabet.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.096
But what we do have
are some intriguing one-offs,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.696
like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain,
known as "The Inscription,"

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.256
with its symmetrical markings on the left,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.496
possible stylized representations
of hands in the middle,

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.840
and what looks a bit
like a bracket on the right.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.936
The oldest systems of graphic
communication in the world --

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.896
Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs,
the earliest Chinese script,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.496
all emerged between 4,000
and 5,000 years ago,

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.656
with each coming into existence
from an earlier protosystem

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.216
made up of counting marks
and pictographic representations,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.616
where the meaning
and the image were the same.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.856
So a picture of a bird would really
have represented that animal.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.616
It's only later that we start to see
these pictographs become more stylized,

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.976
until they almost become unrecognizable

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.016
and that we also start to see
more symbols being invented

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.936
to represent all those other
missing words in language --

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.080
things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.696
So knowing all this,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.576
it seems highly unlikely that
the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.296
were truly abstract written characters.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.536
Instead, what's much more likely

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.536
is that these early artists
were also making counting marks,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.576
maybe like this row of lines
from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.216
as well as creating
stylized representations

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.736
of things from the world around them.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.376
Could some of the signs
be weaponry or housing?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.536
Or what about celestial objects
like star constellations?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.176
Or maybe even rivers, mountains,
trees -- landscape features,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.576
possibly like this black penniform
surrounded by strange bell-shaped signs

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.176
from the site of El Castillo in Spain.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.496
The term penniform
means "feather-shaped" in Latin,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.360
but could this actually be
a depiction of a plant or a tree?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.696
Some researchers have begun
to ask these questions

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.616
about certain signs at specific sites,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.536
but I believe the time has come
to revisit this category as a whole.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.296
The irony in all of this, of course,

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.616
is that having just carefully classified
all of the signs into a single category,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.136
I have a feeling that my next step
will involve breaking it back apart

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.416
as different types of imagery
are identified and separated off.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.656
Now don't get me wrong,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.296
the later creation
of fully developed writing

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.936
was an impressive feat in its own right.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.416
But it's important to remember

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.736
that those early writing systems
didn't come out of a vacuum.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.736
And that even 5,000 years ago,

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.096
people were already building
on something much older,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.856
with its origins stretching back
tens of thousands of years --

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.976
to the geometric signs
of Ice Age Europe and far beyond,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.296
to that point, deep
in our collective history,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.376
when someone first came up with the idea
of making a graphic mark,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.336
and forever changed the nature
of how we communicate.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.576
Thank you.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.040
