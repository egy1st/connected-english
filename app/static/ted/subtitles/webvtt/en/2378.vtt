Guillaume Néry, France.

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:31.841
Constant weight, 123 meters,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.123
three minutes and 25 seconds.

00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:36.341
National record attempt.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.175
70 meters.

00:01:20.056 --> 00:01:22.119
[123 meters]

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:12.124

Guillaume Néry! National record!

00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:18.991
Guillaume Néry: Thank you.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:22.048
(Applause)

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.394
Thank you very much,
thanks for the warm welcome.

00:02:25.418 --> 00:02:28.622
That dive you just watched is a journey --

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:30.860
a journey between two breaths.

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:33.662
A journey that takes place
between two breaths --

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.940
the last one before diving into the water,

00:02:35.964 --> 00:02:38.794
and the first one,
coming back to the surface.

00:02:39.394 --> 00:02:43.768
That dive is a journey
to the very limits of human possibility,

00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:45.728
a journey into the unknown.

00:02:46.315 --> 00:02:49.846
But it's also, and above all,
an inner journey,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.264
where a number of things happen,

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:54.617
physiologically as well as mentally.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.657
And that's why I'm here today,

00:02:56.681 --> 00:03:00.014
to share my journey with you
and to take you along with me.

00:03:00.038 --> 00:03:02.503
So, we start with the last breath.

00:03:03.987 --> 00:03:07.062
(Breathing in)

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:19.119
(Breathing out)

00:03:19.143 --> 00:03:23.586
As you noticed, that last breath
in is slow, deep and intense.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.166
It ends with a special technique
called the carp,

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.831
which allows me to store one to two
extra liters of air in my lungs

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:31.968
by compressing it.

00:03:31.992 --> 00:03:36.587
When I leave the surface,
I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs.

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:41.060
As soon as I leave the surface
the first mechanism kicks in:

00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:42.520
the diving reflex.

00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:47.428
The first thing the diving reflex does
is make your heart rate drop.

00:03:47.452 --> 00:03:50.285
My heart beat will drop
from about 60-70 per minute

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:52.089
to about 30-40 beats per minute

00:03:52.113 --> 00:03:55.034
in a matter of seconds;
almost immediately.

00:03:55.058 --> 00:03:58.147
Next, the diving reflex causes
peripheral vasoconstriction,

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:02.341
which means that the blood flow
will leave the body's extremities

00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:05.709
to feed the most important organs:

00:04:06.382 --> 00:04:09.803
the lungs, the heart and the brain.

00:04:10.602 --> 00:04:14.086
This mechanism is innate.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.526
I cannot control it.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.342
If you go underwater,
even if you've never done it before,

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:20.711
you'll experience the exact same effects.

00:04:20.735 --> 00:04:24.358
All human beings
share this characteristic.

00:04:24.382 --> 00:04:26.308
And what's extraordinary

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:29.849
is that we share this instinct
with marine mammals --

00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:33.531
all marine mammals:
dolphins, whales, sea lions, etc.

00:04:33.555 --> 00:04:38.151
When they dive deep into the ocean,
these mechanisms become activated,

00:04:38.175 --> 00:04:39.508
but to a greater extent.

00:04:39.532 --> 00:04:42.055
And, of course, it works
much better for them.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.364
It's absolutely fascinating.

00:04:45.388 --> 00:04:46.814
Right as I leave the surface,

00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:49.147
nature gives me a push
in the right direction,

00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:51.563
allowing me to descend with confidence.

00:04:51.587 --> 00:04:53.603
So as I dive deeper into the blue,

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:57.619
the pressure slowly starts
to squeeze my lungs.

00:04:58.338 --> 00:05:01.589
And since it's the amount of air
in my lungs that makes me float,

00:05:01.613 --> 00:05:04.541
the farther down I go,
the more pressure there is on my lungs,

00:05:04.565 --> 00:05:08.168
the less air they contain
and the easier it is for my body to fall.

00:05:08.192 --> 00:05:10.995
And at one point,
around 35 or 40 meters down,

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.708
I don't even need to swim.

00:05:14.468 --> 00:05:19.239
My body is dense and heavy enough
to fall into the depths by itself,

00:05:19.263 --> 00:05:21.858
and I enter what's called
the free fall phase.

00:05:21.882 --> 00:05:24.604
The free fall phase
is the best part of the dive.

00:05:24.628 --> 00:05:26.506
It's the reason I still dive.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.490
Because it feels like
you're being pulled down

00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:33.098
and you don't need to do anything.

00:05:33.122 --> 00:05:37.016
I can go from 35 meters to 123 meters
without making a single movement.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.982
I let myself be pulled by the depths,

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:40.944
and it feels like I'm flying underwater.

00:05:40.968 --> 00:05:44.951
It's truly an amazing feeling --
an extraordinary feeling of freedom.

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:47.958
And so I slowly continue
sliding to the bottom.

00:05:47.982 --> 00:05:49.262
40 meters down,

00:05:49.286 --> 00:05:50.583
50 meters down,

00:05:50.607 --> 00:05:54.834
and between 50 and 60 meters,
a second physiological response kicks in.

00:05:55.702 --> 00:05:58.218
My lungs reach residual volume,

00:05:58.242 --> 00:06:03.181
below which they're not supposed
to be compressed, in theory.

00:06:03.205 --> 00:06:06.731
And this second response
is called blood shift,

00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:09.358
or "pulmonary erection" in French.

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:11.545
I prefer "blood shift."

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:12.726
(Laughter)

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.495
So blood shift -- how does it work?

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:20.093
The capillaries in the lungs
become engorged with blood --

00:06:20.117 --> 00:06:21.710
which is caused by the suction --

00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:23.445
so the lungs can harden

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:26.141
and protect the whole chest cavity
from being crushed.

00:06:26.165 --> 00:06:30.068
It prevents the two walls
of the lungs from collapsing,

00:06:30.092 --> 00:06:32.054
from sticking together and caving in.

00:06:32.078 --> 00:06:35.967
Thanks to this phenomenon,
which we also share with marine mammals,

00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:37.694
I'm able to continue with my dive.

00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:41.294
60, 70 meters down,
I keep falling, faster and faster,

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:44.230
because the pressure is crushing
my body more and more.

00:06:44.254 --> 00:06:45.777
Below 80 meters,

00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:48.370
the pressure becomes a lot stronger,

00:06:48.394 --> 00:06:50.465
and I start to feel it physically.

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:52.494
I really start to feel the suffocation.

00:06:52.518 --> 00:06:54.978
You can see what it looks like --
not pretty at all.

00:06:55.002 --> 00:06:59.240
The diaphragm is completely collapsed,
the rib cage is squeezed in,

00:06:59.824 --> 00:07:02.307
and mentally, there is something
going on as well.

00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.098
You may be thinking,
"This doesn't look enjoyable.

00:07:05.122 --> 00:07:06.421
How do you do it?"

00:07:06.445 --> 00:07:08.246
If I relied on my earthly reflexes --

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.733
what do we do above water
when there's a problem?

00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:13.966
We resist, we go against it.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.333
We fight.

00:07:15.357 --> 00:07:16.889
Underwater, that doesn't work.

00:07:16.913 --> 00:07:19.505
If you try that underwater,
you might tear your lungs,

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:21.095
spit up blood, develop an edema

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:24.254
and you'll have to stop diving
for a good amount of time.

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:27.452
So what you need to do, mentally,
is to tell yourself

00:07:27.476 --> 00:07:30.246
that nature and the elements
are stronger than you.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.896
And so I let the water crush me.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.768
I accept the pressure and go with it.

00:07:36.481 --> 00:07:38.825
At this point, my body
receives this information,

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:40.707
and my lungs start relaxing.

00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:43.874
I relinquish all control,
and relax completely.

00:07:43.898 --> 00:07:47.748
The pressure starts crushing me,
and it doesn't feel bad at all.

00:07:47.772 --> 00:07:51.082
I even feel like
I'm in a cocoon, protected.

00:07:51.106 --> 00:07:53.678
And the dive continues.

00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:55.400
80, 85 meters down,

00:07:55.424 --> 00:07:56.643
90,

00:07:56.667 --> 00:07:57.850
100.

00:07:57.874 --> 00:08:00.460
100 meters -- the magic number.

00:08:01.024 --> 00:08:02.886
In every sport, it's a magic number.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.740
For swimmers and athletes
and also for us, free divers,

00:08:05.764 --> 00:08:07.410
it's a number everyone dreams of.

00:08:07.434 --> 00:08:10.832
Everyone wishes one day
to be able to get to 100 meters.

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:12.641
And it's a symbolic number for us,

00:08:12.665 --> 00:08:16.532
because in the 1970s,
doctors and physiologists did their math,

00:08:16.556 --> 00:08:21.865
and predicted that the human body
would not be able to go below 100 meters.

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:24.745
Below that, they said,
the human body would implode.

00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:26.881
And then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol --

00:08:26.905 --> 00:08:29.198
you all know him as the hero
in "The Big Blue" --

00:08:29.222 --> 00:08:32.475
came along and dived down to 100 meters.

00:08:32.499 --> 00:08:34.064
He even reached 105 meters.

00:08:34.088 --> 00:08:35.984
At that time, he was doing "no limits."

00:08:36.008 --> 00:08:39.357
He'd use weights to descend faster
and come back up with a balloon,

00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:40.553
just like in the movie.

00:08:40.577 --> 00:08:43.155
Today, we go down 200 meters
in no limit free diving.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.035
I can do 123 meters
by simply using muscle strength.

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:49.790
And in a way, it's all thanks to him,
because he challenged known facts,

00:08:49.814 --> 00:08:54.181
and with a sweep of his hand,
got rid of the theoretical beliefs

00:08:54.205 --> 00:08:57.606
and all the mental limits
that we like to impose on ourselves.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.246
He showed us that the human body
has an infinite ability to adapt.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.989
So I carry on with my dive.

00:09:03.013 --> 00:09:05.147
105, 110, 115.

00:09:05.171 --> 00:09:06.941
The bottom is getting closer.

00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:08.441
120,

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:09.655
123 meters.

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:10.958
I'm at the bottom.

00:09:10.982 --> 00:09:14.592
And now, I'd like to ask you to join me
and put yourself in my place.

00:09:14.616 --> 00:09:16.251
Close your eyes.

00:09:16.752 --> 00:09:19.521
Imagine you get to 123 meters.

00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:24.125
The surface is far, far away.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.176
You're alone.

00:09:27.864 --> 00:09:29.621
There's hardly any light.

00:09:30.324 --> 00:09:31.579
It's cold --

00:09:31.603 --> 00:09:32.960
freezing cold.

00:09:32.984 --> 00:09:35.037
The pressure is crushing you completely --

00:09:35.061 --> 00:09:37.147
13 times stronger than on the surface.

00:09:38.214 --> 00:09:40.123
And I know what you're thinking:

00:09:40.147 --> 00:09:42.096
"This is horrible.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.976
What the hell am I doing here?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.690
He's insane."

00:09:46.484 --> 00:09:47.650
But no.

00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:50.291
That's not what I think
when I'm down there.

00:09:50.315 --> 00:09:52.040
When I'm at the bottom, I feel good.

00:09:52.064 --> 00:09:54.321
I get this extraordinary
feeling of well-being.

00:09:54.345 --> 00:09:57.234
Maybe it's because I've completely
released all tensions

00:09:57.258 --> 00:09:58.979
and let myself go.

00:09:59.003 --> 00:10:02.464
I feel great, without the need to breathe.

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:09.198
Although, you'd agree,
I should be worried.

00:10:09.999 --> 00:10:12.322
I feel like a tiny dot,
a little drop of water,

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:14.196
floating in the middle of the ocean.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.855
And each time, I picture the same image.

00:10:17.736 --> 00:10:20.045
[The Pale Blue Dot]

00:10:20.473 --> 00:10:22.927
It's that small dot
the arrow is pointing to.

00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:24.473
Do you know what it is?

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.870
It's planet Earth.

00:10:27.478 --> 00:10:30.139
Planet Earth, photographed
by the Voyager probe,

00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:32.315
from 4 billion kilometers away.

00:10:32.339 --> 00:10:36.435
And it shows that our home
is that small dot over there,

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:38.102
floating in the middle of nothing.

00:10:38.126 --> 00:10:40.047
That's how I feel

00:10:40.071 --> 00:10:42.222
when I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters.

00:10:42.246 --> 00:10:43.961
I feel like a small dot,

00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:46.540
a speck of dust, stardust,

00:10:46.564 --> 00:10:48.779
floating in the middle of the cosmos,

00:10:48.803 --> 00:10:51.247
in the middle of nothing,
in the immensity of space.

00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:52.712
It's a fascinating sensation,

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:56.791
because when I look up, down,
left, right, in front, behind,

00:10:56.815 --> 00:11:00.006
I see the same thing:
the infinite deep blue.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.046
Nowhere else on Earth
you can experience this --

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.633
looking all around you,
and seeing the same thing.

00:11:06.657 --> 00:11:07.907
It's extraordinary.

00:11:08.562 --> 00:11:10.002
And at that moment,

00:11:10.026 --> 00:11:13.027
I still get that feeling each time,
building up inside of me --

00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:15.573
the feeling of humility.

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:19.781
Looking at this picture,
I feel very humble --

00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:22.336
just like when I'm all the way
down at the bottom --

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.637
because I'm nothing,

00:11:23.661 --> 00:11:26.986
I'm a little speck of nothingness
lost in all of time and space.

00:11:27.652 --> 00:11:29.969
And it still is absolutely fascinating.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.463
I decide to go back to the surface,
because this is not where I belong.

00:11:34.487 --> 00:11:36.716
I belong up there, on the surface.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.917
So I start heading back up.

00:11:40.018 --> 00:11:44.269
I get something of a shock

00:11:44.293 --> 00:11:46.756
at the very moment when I decide to go up.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.687
First, because it takes a huge effort
to tear yourself away from the bottom.

00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:53.191
It pulled you down on the way in,

00:11:53.215 --> 00:11:55.098
and will do the same on the way up.

00:11:55.122 --> 00:11:56.937
You have to swim twice as hard.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.508
Then, I'm hit with another
phenomenon known as narcosis.

00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:03.294
I don't know if you've heard of that.

00:12:03.318 --> 00:12:05.445
It's called nitrogen narcosis.

00:12:05.469 --> 00:12:07.606
It's something that happens
to scuba divers,

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.249
but it can happen to free divers.

00:12:09.273 --> 00:12:12.802
It's caused by nitrogen
dissolving in the blood,

00:12:12.826 --> 00:12:14.720
which causes confusion

00:12:14.744 --> 00:12:17.347
between the conscious
and unconscious mind.

00:12:18.212 --> 00:12:22.419
A flurry of thoughts goes spinning
through your head.

00:12:22.443 --> 00:12:25.439
You can't control them,
and you shouldn't try to --

00:12:25.463 --> 00:12:27.047
you have to let it happen.

00:12:27.071 --> 00:12:30.778
The more you try to control it,
the harder it is to manage.

00:12:31.223 --> 00:12:32.691
Then, a third thing happens:

00:12:32.715 --> 00:12:33.984
the desire to breathe.

00:12:34.008 --> 00:12:36.318
I'm not a fish, I'm a human being,

00:12:36.342 --> 00:12:39.863
and the desire to breathe
reminds me of that fact.

00:12:39.887 --> 00:12:41.751
Around 60, 70 meters,

00:12:43.551 --> 00:12:45.804
you start to feel the need to breathe.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.086
And with everything else that's going on,

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.047
you can very easily lose your ground

00:12:53.071 --> 00:12:54.610
and start to panic.

00:12:55.871 --> 00:12:58.292
When that happens, you think,
"Where's the surface?

00:12:58.316 --> 00:13:00.251
I want to go up. I want to breathe now."

00:13:00.275 --> 00:13:01.907
You should not do that.

00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:03.765
Never look up to the surface --

00:13:03.789 --> 00:13:06.418
not with your eyes, or your mind.

00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:09.890
You should never
picture yourself up there.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.552
You have to stay in the present.

00:13:11.576 --> 00:13:16.398
I look at the rope right in front of me,
leading me back to the surface.

00:13:16.834 --> 00:13:19.344
And I focus on that,
on the present moment.

00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:22.005
Because if I think
about the surface, I panic.

00:13:22.029 --> 00:13:23.718
And if I panic, it's over.

00:13:24.925 --> 00:13:27.136
Time goes faster this way.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.255
And at 30 meters: deliverance.

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:30.683
I'm not alone any more.

00:13:30.707 --> 00:13:34.106
The safety divers,
my guardian angels, join me.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.453
They leave the surface,
we meet at 30 meters,

00:13:36.477 --> 00:13:38.631
and they escort me
for the final few meters,

00:13:38.655 --> 00:13:41.331
where potential problems could arise.

00:13:41.881 --> 00:13:44.226
Every time I see them, I think to myself,

00:13:45.253 --> 00:13:46.841
"It's thanks to you."

00:13:46.865 --> 00:13:48.961
It's thanks to them,
my team, that I'm here.

00:13:48.985 --> 00:13:51.166
It brings back the sense of humility.

00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:55.056
Without my team, without all
the people around me,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.435
the adventure into the deep
would be impossible.

00:13:57.459 --> 00:14:00.687
A journey into the deep
is above all a group effort.

00:14:01.359 --> 00:14:03.617
So I'm happy to finish
my journey with them,

00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:06.135
because I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for them.

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:07.750
20 meters, 10 meters,

00:14:07.774 --> 00:14:10.021
my lungs slowly return
to their normal volume.

00:14:10.045 --> 00:14:12.392
Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface.

00:14:12.416 --> 00:14:15.964
Five meters below the surface,
I start to breathe out,

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:19.253
so that as soon as I get
to the surface all I do is breathe in.

00:14:19.277 --> 00:14:21.242
And so I arrive at the surface.

00:14:21.544 --> 00:14:24.469
(Breathing in)

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:29.661
Air floods into my lungs.

00:14:29.685 --> 00:14:32.073
It's like being born again, a relief.

00:14:32.896 --> 00:14:34.051
It feels good.

00:14:34.075 --> 00:14:35.941
Though the journey was extraordinary,

00:14:35.965 --> 00:14:39.917
I do need to feel those small
oxygen molecules fueling my body.

00:14:40.385 --> 00:14:43.970
It's an extraordinary sensation,
but at the same time it's traumatizing.

00:14:43.994 --> 00:14:46.391
It's a shock to the system,
as you can you imagine.

00:14:46.415 --> 00:14:49.188
I go from complete darkness
to the light of day,

00:14:49.212 --> 00:14:53.434
from the near-silence of the depths
to the commotion up top.

00:14:54.388 --> 00:14:58.921
In terms of touch, I go from the soft,
velvety feeling of the water,

00:14:58.945 --> 00:15:01.247
to air rubbing across my face.

00:15:01.271 --> 00:15:04.248
In terms of smell,

00:15:04.272 --> 00:15:06.908
there is air rushing into my lungs.

00:15:06.932 --> 00:15:09.344
And in return, my lungs open up.

00:15:09.368 --> 00:15:11.911
They were completely squashed
just 90 seconds ago,

00:15:11.935 --> 00:15:13.623
and now, they've opened up again.

00:15:13.647 --> 00:15:17.483
So all of this affects
quite a lot of things.

00:15:17.507 --> 00:15:19.827
I need a few seconds to come back,

00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:21.430
and to feel "all there" again.

00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:23.036
But that needs to happen quickly,

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.172
because the judges are there
to verify my performance;

00:15:26.196 --> 00:15:28.781
I need to show them
I'm in perfect physical condition.

00:15:28.805 --> 00:15:31.657
You saw in the video,
I was doing a so-called exit protocol.

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:35.844
Once at the surface, I have 15 seconds
to take off my nose clip,

00:15:36.684 --> 00:15:39.565
give this signal and say
(English) "I am OK."

00:15:39.989 --> 00:15:41.487
Plus, you need to be bilingual.

00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:42.953
(Laughter)

00:15:42.977 --> 00:15:44.143
On top of everything --

00:15:44.167 --> 00:15:45.436
that's not very nice.

00:15:46.897 --> 00:15:50.548
Once the protocol is completed,
the judges show me a white card,

00:15:50.572 --> 00:15:52.169
and that's when the joy starts.

00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:55.201
I can finally celebrate
what has just happened.

00:15:55.976 --> 00:15:58.254
So, the journey I've just described to you

00:15:58.278 --> 00:16:01.451
is a more extreme version of free diving.

00:16:01.921 --> 00:16:04.112
Luckily, it's far from just that.

00:16:04.136 --> 00:16:05.343
For the past few years,

00:16:05.367 --> 00:16:08.054
I've been trying to show
another side of free diving,

00:16:08.078 --> 00:16:11.185
because the media mainly talks
about competitions and records.

00:16:11.209 --> 00:16:13.090
But free diving is more than just that.

00:16:13.114 --> 00:16:15.042
It's about being at ease in the water.

00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:18.050
It's extremely beautiful,
very poetic and artistic.

00:16:18.074 --> 00:16:20.138
So my wife and I decided to film it

00:16:20.162 --> 00:16:22.688
and try to show another side of it,

00:16:23.284 --> 00:16:25.728
mostly to make people want
to go into the water.

00:16:26.089 --> 00:16:30.584
Let me show you some images
to finish my story.

00:16:31.854 --> 00:16:34.036
It's a mix of beautiful underwater photos.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.212
(Music)

00:16:35.236 --> 00:16:40.295
I'd like you to know that if one day
you try to stop breathing,

00:16:40.319 --> 00:16:42.615
you'll realize that
when you stop breathing,

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.726
you stop thinking, too.

00:16:45.355 --> 00:16:47.147
It calms your mind.

00:16:47.934 --> 00:16:51.220
Today, in the 21st century,
we're under so much pressure.

00:16:51.244 --> 00:16:54.271
Our minds are overworked,
we think at a million miles an hour,

00:16:54.295 --> 00:16:56.175
we're always stressed.

00:16:56.199 --> 00:16:59.203
Being able to free dive
lets you, just for a moment,

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:00.702
relax your mind.

00:17:01.362 --> 00:17:03.354
Holding your breath underwater

00:17:03.378 --> 00:17:07.374
means giving yourself the chance
to experience weightlessness.

00:17:07.398 --> 00:17:10.352
It means being underwater, floating,

00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:14.199
with your body completely relaxed,
letting go of all your tensions.

00:17:14.223 --> 00:17:16.102
This is our plight in the 21st century:

00:17:16.126 --> 00:17:18.443
our backs hurt, our necks hurt,
everything hurts,

00:17:18.467 --> 00:17:20.676
because we're stressed
and tense all the time.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.129
But when you're in the water,

00:17:22.153 --> 00:17:24.743
you let yourself float,
as if you were in space.

00:17:25.151 --> 00:17:26.835
You let yourself go completely.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.352
It's an extraordinary feeling.

00:17:28.376 --> 00:17:34.033
You can finally get in touch
with your body, mind and spirit.

00:17:34.476 --> 00:17:36.514
Everything feels better, all at once.

00:17:37.952 --> 00:17:42.147
Learning how to free dive is also
about learning to breathe correctly.

00:17:42.718 --> 00:17:47.176
We breathe with our first breath
at birth, up until our last one.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.754
Breathing gives rhythm to our lives.

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:54.127
Learning how to breathe better
is learning how to live better.

00:17:54.746 --> 00:17:57.881
Holding your breath in the sea,
not necessarily at 100 meters,

00:17:57.905 --> 00:17:59.180
but maybe at two or three,

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.270
putting on your goggles,
a pair of flippers,

00:18:01.294 --> 00:18:02.990
means you can go see another world,

00:18:03.014 --> 00:18:05.072
another universe, completely magical.

00:18:05.096 --> 00:18:08.501
You can see little fish, seaweed,
the flora and fauna,

00:18:08.525 --> 00:18:10.843
you can watch it all discreetly,

00:18:10.867 --> 00:18:14.153
sliding underwater, looking around,
and coming back to the surface,

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:15.684
leaving no trace.

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:20.152
It's an amazing feeling
to become one with nature like that.

00:18:21.219 --> 00:18:23.691
And if I may say one more thing,

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:29.676
holding your breath, being in the water,
finding this underwater world --

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.669
it's all about connecting with yourself.

00:18:31.693 --> 00:18:35.986
You heard me talk a lot
about the body's memory

00:18:36.621 --> 00:18:39.522
that dates back millions of years,
to our marine origins.

00:18:39.546 --> 00:18:42.212
The day you get back into the water,

00:18:42.236 --> 00:18:44.727
when you hold your breath
for a few seconds,

00:18:44.751 --> 00:18:47.671
you will reconnect with those origins.

00:18:48.243 --> 00:18:49.762
And I guarantee

00:18:49.786 --> 00:18:51.127
it's absolute magic.

00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:52.604
I encourage you to try it out.

00:18:52.628 --> 00:18:53.794
Thank you.

00:18:53.818 --> 00:18:57.539
(Applause)
