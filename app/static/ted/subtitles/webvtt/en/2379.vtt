00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.416
Chris Anderson: Perhaps we could start
by just telling us about your country.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.296
It's three dots there on the globe.
Those dots are pretty huge.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.976
I think each one
is about the size of California.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.856
Tell us about Kiribati.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.376
Anote Tong: Well, let me first begin
by saying how deeply grateful I am

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.536
for this opportunity to share my story
with people who do care.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.136
I think I've been sharing my story with
a lot of people who don't care too much.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.016
But Kiribati is comprised
of three groups of islands:

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.856
the Gilbert Group on the west,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.216
we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.656
and the Line Islands in the east.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.776
And quite frankly, Kiribati
is perhaps the only country

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.141
that is actually
in the four corners of the world,

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.465
because we are in the Northern Hemisphere,
in the Southern Hemisphere,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.545
and also in the east and the west
of the International Date Line.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.896
These islands are entirely
made up of coral atolls,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.855
and on average about
two meters above sea level.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.336
And so this is what we have.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.176
Usually not more
than two kilometers in width.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.136
And so, on many occasions,
I've been asked by people,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.696
"You know, you're suffering,
why don't you move back?"

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.936
They don't understand.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.656
They have no concept
of what it is that's involved.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.256
With the rising sea, they say,
"Well, you can move back."

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.856
And so this is what I tell them.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.216
If we move back, we will fall off
on the other side of the ocean. OK?

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.016
But these are the kinds of issues
that people don't understand.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.256
CA: So certainly this is
just a picture of fragility there.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.816
When was it that you yourself realized

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.456
that there might be
impending peril for your country?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.936
AT: Well, the story of climate change
has been one that has been going on

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.416
for quite a number of decades.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.176
And when I came into office in 2003,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.456
I began talking about climate change
at the United Nations General Assembly,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.216
but not with so much passion,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.856
because then there was still
this controversy among the scientists

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.136
whether it was human-induced,
whether it was real or it wasn't.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.296
But I think that that debate
was fairly much concluded in 2007

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.896
with the Fourth Assessment
Report of the IPCC,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.776
which made a categorical statement
that it is real, it's human-induced,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.736
and it's predicting
some very serious scenarios

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.296
for countries like mine.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.576
And so that's when I got very serious.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.576
In the past, I talked about it.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.816
We were worried.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.576
But when the scenarios,
the predictions came in 2007,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.936
it became a real issue for us.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.576
CA: Now, those predictions are,
I think, that by 2100,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.376
sea levels are forecast to rise
perhaps three feet.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.020
There's scenarios where
it's higher than that, for sure,

00:03:05.044 --> 00:03:07.180
but what would you say
to a skeptic who said,

00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:08.376
"What's three feet?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.576
You're on average
six feet above sea level.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.176
What's the problem?"

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.256
AT: Well, I think
it's got to be understood

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.336
that a marginal rise in sea level

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.936
would mean a loss of a lot of land,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.216
because much of the land is low.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.336
And quite apart from that,
we are getting the swells at the moment.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.536
So it's not about getting two feet.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.576
I think what many people do not understand

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.776
is they think climate change is something
that is happening in the future.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.616
Well, we're at the very
bottom end of the spectrum.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.896
It's already with us.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.736
We have communities
who already have been dislocated.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.696
They have had to move,
and every parliament session,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.056
I'm getting complaints
from different communities

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.136
asking for assistance to build seawalls,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.696
to see what we can do
about the freshwater lens

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.536
because it's being destroyed,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.296
and so in my trips
to the different islands,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.016
I'm seeing evidence of communities

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.656
which are now having to cope
with the loss of food crops,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.256
the contamination of the water lenses,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.616
and I see these communities
perhaps leaving, having to relocate,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.976
within five to 10 years.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.936
CA: And then, I think the country
suffered its first cyclone,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.496
and this is connected, yes?
What happened here?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.216
AT: Well, we're on the equator,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.656
and I'm sure many of you understand
that when you're on the equator,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.256
it's supposed to be in the doldrums.
We're not supposed to get the cyclones.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.090
We create them, and then we send them
either north or south.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.496
(Laughter)

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.376
But they aren't supposed to come back.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.924
But for the first time,
at the beginning of this year,

00:04:46.948 --> 00:04:50.616
the Cyclone Pam,
which destroyed Vanuatu,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.096
and in the process,
the very edges of it actually touched

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.496
our two southernmost islands,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.896
and all of Tuvalu was underwater
when Hurricane Pam struck.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.616
But for our two southernmost islands,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.976
we had waves come over half the island,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.456
and so this has never happened before.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.056
It's a new experience.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.416
And I've just come back
from my own constituency,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.776
and I've seen these beautiful trees
which had been there for decades,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.776
they've been totally destroyed.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.496
So this is what's happening,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.376
but when we talk
about the rising sea level,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.496
we think it's something
that happens gradually.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.576
It comes with the winds,
it comes with the swells,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.536
and so they can be magnified,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.736
but what we are beginning to witness
is the change in the weather pattern,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.496
which is perhaps the more urgent challenge

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.056
that we will face sooner
than perhaps the rising sea level.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.336
CA: So the country
is already seeing effects now.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.536
As you look forward,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.496
what are your options
as a country, as a nation?

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.176
AT: Well, I've been telling
this story every year.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.629
I think I visit a number of --

00:06:04.653 --> 00:06:09.616
I've been traveling the world
to try and get people to understand.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.096
We have a plan, we think we have a plan.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.536
And on one occasion,
I think I spoke in Geneva

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.736
and there was a gentleman
who was interviewing me

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.496
on something like this,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.856
and I said, "We are looking
at floating islands,"

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.096
and he thought it was funny,
but somebody said,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.056
"No, this is not funny.
These people are looking for solutions."

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.616
And so I have been looking
at floating islands.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.376
The Japanese are interested
in building floating islands.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.336
But, as a country,
we have made a commitment

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.056
that no matter what happens,
we will try as much as possible

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.256
to stay and continue to exist as a nation.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.816
What that will take,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.256
it's going to be
something quite significant,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.296
very, very substantial.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.096
Either we live on floating islands,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.096
or we have to build up the islands
to continue to stay out of the water

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.856
as the sea level rises
and as the storms get more severe.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.309
But even that, it's going to be
very, very difficult

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:11.176
to get the kind of resourcing
that we would need.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.056
CA: And then the only recourse
is some form of forced migration.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.296
AT: Well, we are also looking at that

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.216
because in the event
that nothing comes forward

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.056
from the international community,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.336
we are preparing,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.576
we don't want to be caught
like what's happening in Europe.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.296
OK? We don't want to mass migrate
at some point in time.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.736
We want to be able
to give the people the choice today,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.416
those who choose
and want to do that, to migrate.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.496
We don't want something to happen
that they are forced to migrate

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.816
without having been prepared to do so.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.336
Of course, our culture is very different,
our society is very different,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.696
and once we migrate
into a different environment,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.936
a different culture,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.896
there's a whole lot
of adjustments that are required.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.176
CA: Well, there's forced migration
in your country's past,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.856
and I think just this week,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.136
just yesterday
or the day before yesterday,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.336
you visited these people.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.536
What happened here? What's the story here?

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.976
AT: Yes, and I'm sorry,
I think somebody was asking

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.976
why we were sneaking off
to visit that place.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.976
I had a very good reason, because we have
a community of Kiribati people

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.096
living in that part
of the Solomon Islands,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.976
but these were people who were relocated
from the Phoenix Islands, in fact,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.456
in the 1960s.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.016
There was serious drought, and the people
could not continue to live on the island,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.416
and so they were moved
to live here in the Solomon Islands.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.616
And so yesterday it was very interesting
to meet with these people.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.096
They didn't know who I was.
They hadn't heard of me.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.696
Some of them later recognized me,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.296
but I think they were very happy.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.736
Later they really wanted to have
the opportunity to welcome me formally.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.016
But I think what I saw yesterday
was very interesting

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.856
because here I see our people.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.696
I spoke in our language, and of course
they spoke back, they replied,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.416
but their accent, they are beginning
not to be able to speak Kiribati properly.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.936
I saw them, there was
this lady with red teeth.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.176
She was chewing betel nuts,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.456
and it's not something we do in Kiribati.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.096
We don't chew betel nuts.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.976
I met also a family who have married
the local people here,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.096
and so this is what is happening.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.696
As you go into another community,
there are bound to be changes.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.176
There is bound to be
a certain loss of identity,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.656
and this is what we will be
looking for in the future

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.936
if and when we do migrate.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.136
CA: It must have been
just an extraordinarily emotional day

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.976
because of these questions about identity,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.216
the joy of seeing you and perhaps
an emphasized sense of what they had lost.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.621
And it's very inspiring to hear you say
you're going to fight to the end

00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:58.056
to try to preserve
the nation in a location.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.376
AT: This is our wish.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.456
Nobody wants ever to leave their home,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.536
and so it's been
a very difficult decision for me.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.936
As a leader, you don't make plans
to leave your island, your home,

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.216
and so I've been asked
on a number of occasions,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.456
"So how do you feel?"

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.616
And it doesn't feel good at all.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.216
It's an emotional thing,
and I've tried to live with it,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.176
and I know that on occasions, I'm accused
of not trying to solve the problem

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.176
because I can't solve the problem.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.016
It's something that's got
to be done collectively.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.816
Climate change is a global phenomenon,
and as I've often argued,

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.336
unfortunately, the countries,
when we come to the United Nations --

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.256
I was in a meeting with
the Pacific Island Forum countries

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.776
where Australia and New Zealand
are also members,

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.536
and we had an argument.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.256
There was a bit of a story in the news

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.576
because they were arguing
that to cut emissions,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.856
it would be something
that they're unable to do

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.096
because it would affect the industries.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.576
And so here I was saying,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.816
OK, I hear you,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.496
I understand what you're saying,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.776
but try also to understand what I'm saying

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.416
because if you do not cut your emissions,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.816
then our survival is on the line.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.176
And so it's a matter for you
to weigh this, these moral issues.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.216
It's about industry as opposed to
the survival of a people.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.896
CA: You know, I ask you yesterday
what made you angry,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.416
and you said, "I don't get angry."
But then you paused.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.056
I think this made you angry.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.976
AT: I'd refer you to my earlier
statement at the United Nations.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.936
I was very angry, very frustrated
and then depressed.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.936
There was a sense of futility

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.416
that we are fighting a fight
that we have no hope of winning.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.616
I had to change my approach.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.736
I had to become more reasonable

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.903
because I thought people would listen
to somebody who was rational,

00:11:56.927 --> 00:11:59.496
but I remain radically rational,
whatever that is.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.136
(Laughter)

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.896
CA: Now, a core part
of your nation's identity is fishing.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.416
I think you said pretty much everyone
is involved in fishing in some way.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.216
AT: Well, we eat fish
every day, every day,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.776
and I think there is no doubt
that our rate of consumption of fish

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.936
is perhaps the highest in the world.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.416
We don't have a lot of livestock,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.216
so it's fish that we depend on.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.376
CA: So you're dependent on fish,
both at the local level

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.096
and for the revenues
that the country receives

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.696
from the global fishing business for tuna,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.616
and yet despite that, a few years ago
you took a very radical step.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.016
Can you tell us about that?

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.376
I think something happened
right here in the Phoenix Islands.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.696
AT: Let me give some of the background
of what fish means for us.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.656
We have one of the largest
tuna fisheries remaining in the world.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.536
In the Pacific, I think we own
something like 60 percent

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.456
of the remaining tuna fisheries,

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.736
and it remains relatively healthy
for some species, but not all.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.880
And Kiribati is one of the three
major resource owners,

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.616
tuna resource owners.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.216
And at the moment, we have been getting

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.136
something like 80 to 90
percent of our revenue

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.616
from access fees, license fees.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.496
CA: Of your national revenue.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.336
AT: National revenue,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.176
which drives everything that we do

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.216
in governments, hospitals,
schools and what have you.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.456
But we decided to close this,
and it was a very difficult decision.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:38.016
I can assure you, politically,
locally, it was not easy,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.976
but I was convinced that we had to do this

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.576
in order to ensure
that the fishery remains sustainable.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.376
There had been some indications
that some of the species,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.536
in particular the bigeye,
was under serious threat.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.936
The yellowfin was also heavily fished.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.696
Skipjack remains healthy.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.496
And so we had to do something like that,
and so that was the reason I did that.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.416
Another reason why I did that

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.136
was because I had been asking
the international community

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.696
that in order to deal with climate change,
in order to fight climate change,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.616
there has got to be sacrifice,
there has got to be commitment.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.936
So in asking the international community
to make a sacrifice,

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.776
I thought we ourselves
need to make that sacrifice.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.616
And so we made the sacrifice.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.583
And forgoing commercial fishing

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:38.216
in the Phoenix Islands protected area

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.096
would mean a loss of revenue.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.597
We are still trying to assess
what that loss would be

00:14:42.621 --> 00:14:47.856
because we actually closed it off
at the beginning of this year,

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.216
and so we will see by the end of this year

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.736
what it means in terms
of the lost revenue.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.016
CA: So there's so many things
playing into this.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:03.016
On the one hand,
it may prompt healthier fisheries.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.416
I mean, how much are you able
to move the price up

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.936
that you charge for the remaining areas?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.576
AT: The negotiations
have been very difficult,

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.456
but we have managed
to raise the cost of a vessel day.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.096
For any vessel
to come in to fish for a day,

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.736
we have raised the fee from --
it was $6,000 and $8,000,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.336
now to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.576
And so there's been
that significant increase.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.176
But at the same time,
what's important to note is,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.536
whereas in the past these fishing boats

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.496
might be fishing in a day
and maybe catch 10 tons,

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.416
now they're catching maybe 100 tons
because they've become so efficient.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.776
And so we've got to respond likewise.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.976
We've got to be very, very careful
because the technology has so improved.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.416
There was a time when the Brazilian fleet
moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.656
They couldn't.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.896
They started experimenting
if they could, per se.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.600
But now they've got ways of doing it,
and they've become so efficient.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.198
CA: Can you give us a sense
of what it's like in those negotiations?

00:16:12.223 --> 00:16:13.920
Because you're up against companies

00:16:13.944 --> 00:16:17.536
that have hundreds of millions
of dollars at stake, essentially.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.896
How do you hold the line?

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.976
Is there any advice you can give

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.056
to other leaders who are dealing
with the same companies

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.376
about how to get
the most for your country,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.416
get the most for the fish?

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.976
What advice would you give?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.256
AT: Well, I think we focus
too often on licensing

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.947
in order to get the rate of return,

00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:46.776
because what we are getting
from license fees

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.416
is about 10 percent
of the landed value of the catch

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.576
on the side of the wharf,
not in the retail shops.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.576
And we only get about 10 percent.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.216
What we have been trying
to do over the years

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:03.096
is actually to increase
our participation in the industry,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.736
in the harvesting, in the processing,

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.617
and eventually, hopefully, the marketing.

00:17:07.642 --> 00:17:11.336
They're not easy to penetrate,

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.656
but we are working towards that,

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.296
and yes, the answer would be to enhance.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:20.536
In order to increase our rate of return,
we have to become more involved.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.736
And so we've started doing that,

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.016
and we have to restructure the industry.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.416
We've got to tell these people
that the world has changed.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.856
Now we want to produce the fish ourselves.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.976
CA: And meanwhile,
for your local fishermen,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.096
they are still able to fish,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.576
but what is business like for them?

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.936
Is it getting harder?
Are the waters depleted?

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.416
Or is that being run
on a sustainable basis?

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.896
AT: For the artisanal fishery,

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.176
we do not participate
in the commercial fishing activity

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.216
except only to supply the domestic market.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.536
The tuna fishery is really
entirely for the foreign market,

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.776
mostly here in the US, Europe, Japan.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.336
So I am a fisherman, very much,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.536
and I used to be able to catch yellowfin.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.336
Now it's very, very rare
to be able to catch yellowfin

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.736
because they are being lifted
out of the water by the hundreds of tons

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.640
by these purse seiners.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.296
CA: So here's a couple
of beautiful girls from your country.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.536
I mean, as you think about their future,

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.216
what message would you have for them

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.256
and what message
would you have for the world?

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.709
AT: Well, I've been telling the world
that we really have to do something

00:18:39.733 --> 00:18:41.576
about what is happening to the climate

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.376
because for us, it's about
the future of these children.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.336
I have 12 grandchildren, at least.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.376
I think I have 12, my wife knows.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.616
(Laughter)

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.656
And I think I have eight children.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.936
It's about their future.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.696
Every day I see my grandchildren,
about the same age as these young girls,

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.136
and I do wonder,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.376
and I get angry sometimes, yes I do.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.456
I wonder what is to become of them.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.616
And so it's about them

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.896
that we should be telling everybody,

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.176
that it's not about
their own national interest,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.856
because climate change,
regrettably, unfortunately,

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.976
is viewed by many countries
as a national problem. It's not.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And this is the argument
we got into recently with our partners,

00:19:24.024 --> 00:19:25.720
the Australians and New Zealanders,

00:19:25.744 --> 00:19:29.056
because they said,
"We can't cut any more."

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.696
This is what one of the leaders,
the Australian leader, said,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.976
that we've done our part,
we are cutting back.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.656
I said, What about the rest?
Why don't you keep it?

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.376
If you could keep
the rest of your emissions

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.696
within your boundaries,
within your borders,

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.496
we'd have no question.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.336
You can go ahead as much as you like.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.496
But unfortunately,
you're sending it our way,

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.711
and it's affecting
the future of our children.

00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:58.776
And so surely I think that is the heart
of the problem of climate change today.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.856
We will be meeting in Paris
at the end of this year,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.816
but until we can think of this
as a global phenomenon,

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.096
because we create it,
individually, as nations,

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.056
but it affects everybody else,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.696
and yet, we refuse
to do anything about it,

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.176
and we deal with it as a national problem,

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.296
which it is not -- it is a global issue,

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.040
and it's got to be
dealt with collectively.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.456
CA: People are incredibly bad
at responding to graphs and numbers,

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.256
and we shut our minds to it.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:37.536
Somehow, to people, we're slightly better
at responding to that sometimes.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.496
And it seems like it's
very possible that your nation,

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.976
despite, actually because of
the intense problems you face,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.896
you may yet be the warning light
to the world that shines most visibly,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.896
most powerfully.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.737
I just want to thank you, 
I'm sure, on behalf of all of us,

00:20:54.762 --> 00:20:57.256
for your extraordinary leadership
and for being here.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.853
Mr. President, thank you so much.

00:20:58.873 --> 00:20:59.646
AT: Thank you.

00:20:59.666 --> 00:21:02.120
(Applause)
