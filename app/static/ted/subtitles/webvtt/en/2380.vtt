00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:04.407
Your company launches
a search for an open position.

00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:07.214
The applications start rolling in,

00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:10.226
and the qualified candidates
are identified.

00:00:10.613 --> 00:00:12.986
Now the choosing begins.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.458
Person A: Ivy League,
4.0, flawless resume,

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:21.366
great recommendations.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.133
All the right stuff.

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:28.785
Person B: state school,
fair amount of job hopping,

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:33.039
and odd jobs like cashier
and singing waitress.

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:37.238
But remember -- both are qualified.

00:00:37.648 --> 00:00:39.164
So I ask you:

00:00:39.188 --> 00:00:41.218
who are you going to pick?

00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:45.551
My colleagues and I created
very official terms

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:49.142
to describe two distinct
categories of candidates.

00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:53.314
We call A "the Silver Spoon,"

00:00:53.338 --> 00:00:57.610
the one who clearly had advantages
and was destined for success.

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:01.838
And we call B "the Scrapper,"

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.934
the one who had to fight
against tremendous odds

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.224
to get to the same point.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.740
You just heard a human resources
director refer to people

00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:13.488
as Silver Spoons and Scrappers --

00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:14.513
(Laughter)

00:01:14.537 --> 00:01:18.916
which is not exactly politically correct
and sounds a bit judgmental.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.340
But before my human resources
certification gets revoked --

00:01:23.364 --> 00:01:24.484
(Laughter)

00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:25.889
let me explain.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.063
A resume tells a story.

00:01:29.087 --> 00:01:32.417
And over the years, I've learned
something about people

00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:35.660
whose experiences read
like a patchwork quilt,

00:01:35.684 --> 00:01:39.160
that makes me stop and fully consider them

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:41.794
before tossing their resumes away.

00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:45.115
A series of odd jobs may indicate

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:49.558
inconsistency, lack of focus,
unpredictability.

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:55.431
Or it may signal a committed
struggle against obstacles.

00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:59.704
At the very least, the Scrapper
deserves an interview.

00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:02.162
To be clear,

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:05.439
I don't hold anything
against the Silver Spoon;

00:02:05.463 --> 00:02:08.929
getting into and graduating
from an elite university

00:02:08.953 --> 00:02:11.723
takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice.

00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:16.364
But if your whole life has been
engineered toward success,

00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:18.517
how will you handle the tough times?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.624
One person I hired felt that
because he attended an elite university,

00:02:23.648 --> 00:02:26.511
there were certain assignments
that were beneath him,

00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:31.640
like temporarily doing manual labor
to better understand an operation.

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:34.473
Eventually, he quit.

00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:37.998
But on the flip side,

00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:42.706
what happens when your whole life
is destined for failure

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.228
and you actually succeed?

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:49.385
I want to urge you
to interview the Scrapper.

00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:54.945
I know a lot about this
because I am a Scrapper.

00:02:55.618 --> 00:02:57.144
Before I was born,

00:02:57.168 --> 00:03:01.131
my father was diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia,

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:04.870
and he couldn't hold a job
in spite of his brilliance.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.947
Our lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest,"

00:03:08.971 --> 00:03:11.037
one part "Awakenings"

00:03:11.061 --> 00:03:13.485
and one part "A Beautiful Mind."

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:15.599
(Laughter)

00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:20.434
I'm the fourth of five children
raised by a single mother

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:23.282
in a rough neighborhood
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:28.062
We never owned a home,
a car, a washing machine,

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:32.408
and for most of my childhood,
we didn't even have a telephone.

00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:34.461
So I was highly motivated

00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:38.864
to understand the relationship
between business success and Scrappers,

00:03:38.888 --> 00:03:43.669
because my life could easily
have turned out very differently.

00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:46.854
As I met successful business people

00:03:46.878 --> 00:03:50.200
and read profiles of high-powered leaders,

00:03:50.224 --> 00:03:52.075
I noticed some commonality.

00:03:52.692 --> 00:03:56.618
Many of them had experienced
early hardships,

00:03:56.642 --> 00:04:00.211
anywhere from poverty, abandonment,

00:04:00.235 --> 00:04:02.441
death of a parent while young,

00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:06.354
to learning disabilities,
alcoholism and violence.

00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:11.171
The conventional thinking has been
that trauma leads to distress,

00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:14.634
and there's been a lot of focus
on the resulting dysfunction.

00:04:14.658 --> 00:04:20.135
But during studies of dysfunction,
data revealed an unexpected insight:

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:26.034
that even the worst circumstances
can result in growth and transformation.

00:04:26.415 --> 00:04:30.247
A remarkable and counterintuitive
phenomenon has been discovered,

00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:34.651
which scientists call
Post Traumatic Growth.

00:04:35.494 --> 00:04:38.670
In one study designed to measure
the effects of adversity

00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:40.652
on children at risk,

00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:45.249
among a subset of 698 children

00:04:45.273 --> 00:04:49.558
who experienced the most severe
and extreme conditions,

00:04:49.582 --> 00:04:56.452
fully one-third grew up to lead healthy,
successful and productive lives.

00:04:56.476 --> 00:05:01.641
In spite of everything and against
tremendous odds, they succeeded.

00:05:01.665 --> 00:05:03.159
One-third.

00:05:03.948 --> 00:05:05.625
Take this resume.

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:08.759
This guy's parents
give him up for adoption.

00:05:08.783 --> 00:05:10.855
He never finishes college.

00:05:11.514 --> 00:05:13.648
He job-hops quite a bit,

00:05:13.672 --> 00:05:16.777
goes on a sojourn to India for a year,

00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:19.912
and to top it off, he has dyslexia.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.241
Would you hire this guy?

00:05:22.918 --> 00:05:24.983
His name is Steve Jobs.

00:05:26.424 --> 00:05:30.402
In a study of the world's
most highly successful entrepreneurs,

00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:34.295
it turns out a disproportionate
number have dyslexia.

00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:36.189
In the US,

00:05:36.213 --> 00:05:40.184
35 percent of the entrepreneurs
studied had dyslexia.

00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:44.705
What's remarkable --
among those entrepreneurs

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.736
who experience post traumatic growth,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.039
they now view their learning disability

00:05:51.063 --> 00:05:55.507
as a desirable difficulty
which provided them an advantage

00:05:55.531 --> 00:06:00.533
because they became better listeners
and paid greater attention to detail.

00:06:01.183 --> 00:06:06.270
They don't think they are who they are
in spite of adversity,

00:06:06.294 --> 00:06:10.633
they know they are who they are
because of adversity.

00:06:11.028 --> 00:06:13.382
They embrace their trauma and hardships

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:16.042
as key elements of who they've become,

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:19.343
and know that without those experiences,

00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:22.773
they might not have developed
the muscle and grit required

00:06:22.797 --> 00:06:24.345
to become successful.

00:06:26.034 --> 00:06:29.317
One of my colleagues
had his life completely upended

00:06:29.341 --> 00:06:33.743
as a result of the Chinese
Cultural Revolution in 1966.

00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:39.729
At age 13, his parents were relocated
to the countryside,

00:06:39.753 --> 00:06:42.054
the schools were closed

00:06:42.078 --> 00:06:47.304
and he was left alone in Beijing
to fend for himself until 16,

00:06:47.328 --> 00:06:49.658
when he got a job in a clothing factory.

00:06:49.983 --> 00:06:52.265
But instead of accepting his fate,

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.468
he made a resolution that he would
continue his formal education.

00:06:57.652 --> 00:07:01.343
Eleven years later, when
the political landscape changed,

00:07:01.367 --> 00:07:05.633
he heard about a highly selective
university admissions test.

00:07:06.383 --> 00:07:10.263
He had three months to learn
the entire curriculum

00:07:10.287 --> 00:07:11.898
of middle and high school.

00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:16.762
So, every day he came home
from the factory,

00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:21.475
took a nap, studied until 4am,
went back to work

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:25.362
and repeated this cycle
every day for three months.

00:07:26.394 --> 00:07:29.016
He did it, he succeeded.

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:34.699
His commitment to his education
was unwavering, and he never lost hope.

00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:38.217
Today, he holds a master's degree,

00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:42.735
and his daughters each have degrees
from Cornell and Harvard.

00:07:43.478 --> 00:07:46.155
Scrappers are propelled by the belief

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:50.660
that the only person you have
full control over is yourself.

00:07:51.647 --> 00:07:53.643
When things don't turn out well,

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:58.683
Scrappers ask, "What can I do differently
to create a better result?"

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:01.034
Scrappers have a sense of purpose

00:08:01.058 --> 00:08:04.164
that prevents them
from giving up on themselves,

00:08:04.188 --> 00:08:10.220
kind of like if you've survived poverty,
a crazy father and several muggings,

00:08:10.244 --> 00:08:12.989
you figure, "Business challenges? --

00:08:13.013 --> 00:08:14.045
(Laughter)

00:08:14.069 --> 00:08:15.457
Really?

00:08:15.481 --> 00:08:17.657
Piece of cake. I got this."

00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:18.842
(Laughter)

00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:20.661
And that reminds me -- humor.

00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:24.840
Scrappers know that humor
gets you through the tough times,

00:08:24.864 --> 00:08:27.418
and laughter helps you
change your perspective.

00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:30.994
And finally, there are relationships.

00:08:31.412 --> 00:08:34.826
People who overcome adversity
don't do it alone.

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:37.166
Somewhere along the way,

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.626
they find people who
bring out the best in them

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.553
and who are invested in their success.

00:08:44.312 --> 00:08:47.576
Having someone you can
count on no matter what

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.369
is essential to overcoming adversity.

00:08:50.862 --> 00:08:52.348
I was lucky.

00:08:52.703 --> 00:08:54.683
In my first job after college,

00:08:54.707 --> 00:08:57.837
I didn't have a car, so I carpooled
across two bridges

00:08:57.861 --> 00:09:00.531
with a woman who was
the president's assistant.

00:09:01.145 --> 00:09:02.797
She watched me work

00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.798
and encouraged me to focus on my future

00:09:05.822 --> 00:09:08.024
and not dwell on my past.

00:09:08.668 --> 00:09:11.637
Along the way I've met many people

00:09:11.661 --> 00:09:15.312
who've provided me
brutally honest feedback,

00:09:15.336 --> 00:09:17.332
advice and mentorship.

00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:19.770
These people don't mind

00:09:19.794 --> 00:09:24.037
that I once worked as a singing waitress
to help pay for college.

00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:25.307
(Laughter)

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:28.520
I'll leave you with one final,
valuable insight.

00:09:28.915 --> 00:09:33.888
Companies that are committed
to diversity and inclusive practices

00:09:33.912 --> 00:09:36.016
tend to support Scrappers

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.849
and outperform their peers.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:42.103
According to DiversityInc,

00:09:42.127 --> 00:09:45.945
a study of their top 50
companies for diversity

00:09:45.969 --> 00:09:50.626
outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 25 percent.

00:09:52.203 --> 00:09:55.348
So back to my original question.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.425
Who are you going to bet on:

00:09:58.449 --> 00:10:00.873
Silver Spoon or Scrapper?

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.515
I say choose the underestimated contender,

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:09.398
whose secret weapons
are passion and purpose.

00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:12.389
Hire the Scrapper.

00:10:12.413 --> 00:10:15.565
(Applause)
