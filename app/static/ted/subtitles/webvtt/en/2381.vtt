WEBVTT

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.176
Now...

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.280
let's go back in time.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.560
It's 1974.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.520
There is the gallery somewhere

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.600
in the world,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.376
and there is a young girl, age 23,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.920
standing in the middle of the space.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.080
In the front of her is a table.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.880
On the table there are 76 objects

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.440
for pleasure and for pain.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.696
Some of the objects are

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.520
a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.640
But also the knife,
the razor blade, the hammer

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.239
and the pistol with one bullet.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.216
There are instructions which say,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.976
"I'm an object.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.336
You can use everything on the table on me.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.440
I'm taking all responsibility --
even killing me.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.520
And the time is six hours."

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.400
The beginning of this
performance was easy.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.856
People would give me
the glass of water to drink,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.520
they'd give me the rose.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.896
But very soon after,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.416
there was a man who took the scissors
and cut my clothes,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.440
and then they took the thorns of the rose
and stuck them in my stomach.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.280
Somebody took the razor blade
and cut my neck and drank the blood,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.680
and I still have the scar.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.280
The women would tell the men what to do.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.816
And the men didn't rape me
because it was just a normal opening,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.536
and it was all public,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.936
and they were with their wives.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.216
They carried me around
and put me on the table,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.136
and put the knife between my legs.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.800
And somebody took the pistol and bullet
and put it against my temple.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.560
And another person took the pistol
and they started a fight.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.656
And after six hours were finished,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.176
I...

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.336
started walking towards the public.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.576
I was a mess.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.920
I was half-naked, I was full of blood
and tears were running down my face.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.880
And everybody escaped, they just ran away.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.280
They could not confront myself,
with myself as a normal human being.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.080
And then --

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.560
what happened

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.720
is I went to the hotel,
it was at two in the morning.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.760
And

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.880
I looked at myself in the mirror,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.320
and I had a piece of gray hair.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.440
Alright --

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.040
please take off your blindfolds.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.040
Welcome to the performance world.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.880
First of all, let's explain
what the performance is.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.376
So many artists,
so many different explanations,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.160
but my explanation
for performance is very simple.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.216
Performance is a mental
and physical construction

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.056
that the performer makes
in a specific time

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.376
in a space in front of an audience

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.720
and then energy dialogue happens.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.800
The audience and the performer
make the piece together.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.360
And the difference between
performance and theater is huge.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.696
In the theater, the knife is not a knife

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.640
and the blood is just ketchup.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.576
In the performance,
the blood is the material,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.896
and the razor blade or knife is the tool.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.816
It's all about being there
in the real time,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.696
and you can't rehearse performance,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.040
because you can't do many
of these types of things twice -- ever.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.856
Which is very important,
the performance is --

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.176
you know, all human beings
are always afraid of very simple things.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.576
We're afraid of suffering,
we're afraid of pain,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.680
we're afraid of mortality.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.496
So what I'm doing --

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.736
I'm staging these kinds of fears
in front of the audience.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.936
I'm using your energy,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.736
and with this energy I can go
and push my body as far as I can.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.336
And then I liberate myself
from these fears.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.656
And I'm your mirror.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.960
If I can do this for myself,
you can do it for you.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.776
After Belgrade, where I was born,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.080
I went to Amsterdam.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.056
And you know, I've been doing performances

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.336
since the last 40 years.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.936
And here I met Ulay,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.336
and he was the person
I actually fell in love with.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.496
And we made, for 12 years,
performances together.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.776
You know the knife
and the pistols and the bullets,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.736
I exchange into love and trust.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.376
So to do this kind work
you have to trust the person completely

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.416
because this arrow
is pointing to my heart.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.776
So, heart beating and adrenaline
is rushing and so on,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.320
is about trust, is about total trust
to another human being.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.536
Our relationship was 12 years,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.416
and we worked on so many subjects,
both male and female energy.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.576
And as every relationship
comes to an end, ours went too.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.256
We didn't make phone calls
like normal human beings do

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.256
and say, you know, "This is over."

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.280
We walked the Great Wall
of China to say goodbye.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.720
I started at the Yellow Sea,
and he started from the Gobi Desert.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.576
We walked, each of us, three months,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.440
two and a half thousand kilometers.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.776
It was the mountains, it was difficult.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.136
It was climbing, it was ruins.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.256
It was, you know, going through
the 12 Chinese provinces,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.096
this was before China was open in '87.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.656
And we succeeded to meet in the middle

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.160
to say goodbye.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.160
And then our relationship stopped.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.960
And now, it completely changed
how I see the public.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.416
And one very important piece
I made in those days

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.416
was "Balkan Baroque."

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.136
And this was the time of the Balkan Wars,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.696
and I wanted to create
some very strong, charismatic image,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.016
something that could serve
for any war at any time,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.056
because the Balkan Wars are now finished,
but there's always some war, somewhere.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.056
So here I am washing

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.856
two and a half thousand
dead, big, bloody cow bones.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.416
You can't wash the blood,
you never can wash shame off the wars.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.016
So I'm washing this six hours, six days,
and wars are coming off these bones,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.280
and becoming possible --
an unbearable smell.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.496
But then something stays in the memory.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.256
I want to show you the one
who really changed my life,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.416
and this was the performance in MoMa,
which I just recently made.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.776
This performance --
when I said to the curator,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.776
"I'm just going to sit at the chair,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.336
and there will be
an empty chair at the front,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.856
and anybody from the public
can come and sit as long as they want."

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.096
The curator said to me,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.776
"That's ridiculous, you know,
this is New York,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.016
this chair will be empty,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.945
nobody has time to sit in front of you."

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:27.136
(Laughter)

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.056
But I sit for three months.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.016
And I sit everyday, eight hours --

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.416
the opening of the museum --

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.336
and 10 hours on Friday
when the museum is open 10 hours,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.534
and I never move.

00:07:36.558 --> 00:07:39.416
And I removed the table
and I'm still sitting,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.560
and this changed everything.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.296
This performance,
maybe 10 or 15 years ago --

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.736
nothing would have happened.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.656
But the need of people to actually
experience something different,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.776
the public was not anymore the group --

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.800
relation was one to one.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.896
I was watching these people,
they would come and sit in front of me,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.616
but they would have to wait
for hours and hours and hours

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.798
to get to this position,

00:08:02.823 --> 00:08:04.376
and finally, they sit.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.960
And what happened?

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.576
They are observed by the other people,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.176
they're photographed,
they're filmed by the camera,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.576
they're observed by me

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.760
and they have nowhere to escape
except in themselves.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.816
And that makes a difference.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.656
There was so much pain and loneliness,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.776
there's so much incredible things
when you look in somebody else's eyes,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.776
because in the gaze
with that total stranger,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.800
that you never even say one word --
everything happened.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.176
And I understood when I stood up
from that chair after three months,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.775
I am not the same anymore.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.576
And I understood
that I have a very strong mission,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.856
that I have to communicate this experience

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.135
to everybody.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.976
And this is how, for me, was born the idea

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
to have an institute
of immaterial performing arts.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.216
Because thinking about immateriality,

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.696
performance is time-based art.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.056
It's not like a painting.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.856
You have the painting on the wall,
the next day it's there.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.576
Performance, if you are missing it,
you only have the memory,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.936
or the story of somebody else telling you,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.896
but you actually missed the whole thing.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.136
So you have to be there.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.056
And in my point,
if you talk about immaterial art,

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.456
music is the highest --
absolutely highest art of all,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.256
because it's the most immaterial.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.138
And then after this is performance,
and then everything else.

00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:22.696
That's my subjective way.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.616
This institute is going to happen
in Hudson, upstate New York,

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.640
and we are trying to build
with Rem Koolhaas, an idea.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.216
And it's very simple.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.896
If you want to get experience,
you have to give me your time.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.016
You have to sign the contract
before you enter the building,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.896
that you will spend there
a full six hours,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.576
you have to give me your word of honor.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.496
It's something so old-fashioned,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.856
but if you don't respect your own
word of honor and you leave before --

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.096
that's not my problem.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.616
But it's six hours, the experience.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.783
And then after you finish,
you get a certificate of accomplishment,

00:09:56.807 --> 00:09:58.856
so get home and frame it if you want.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.896
(Laughter)

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.256
This is orientation hall.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.776
The public comes in, and the first thing
you have to do is dress in lab coats.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.016
It's this importance

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.256
of stepping from being
just a viewer into experimenter.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.696
And then you go to the lockers

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.016
and you put your watch,
your iPhone, your iPod, your computer

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.336
and everything digital, electronic.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.696
And you are getting free time
for yourself for the first time.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.096
Because there is nothing
wrong with technology,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.456
our approach to technology is wrong.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.176
We are losing the time
we have for ourselves.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.496
This is an institute
to actually give you back this time.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.776
So what you do here,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.896
first you start slow walking,
you start slowing down.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.856
You're going back to simplicity.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.496
After slow walking, you're going
to learn how to drink water --

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.160
very simple, drinking water
for maybe half an hour.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.936
After this, you're going to
the magnet chamber,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.856
where you're going to create
some magnet streams on your body.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.336
Then after this,
you go to crystal chamber.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.136
After crystal chamber,
you go to eye-gazing chamber,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.256
after eye-gazing chamber, you go to
a chamber where you are lying down.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.736
So it's the three basic positions
of the human body,

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.096
sitting, standing and lying.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.656
And slow walking.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.496
And there is a sound chamber.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.856
And then after you've seen all of this,

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.023
and prepared yourself
mentally and physically,

00:11:17.047 --> 00:11:19.714
then you are ready to see
something with a long duration,

00:11:19.738 --> 00:11:22.096
like in immaterial art.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.976
It can be music, it can be opera,
it can be a theater piece,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.896
it can be film, it can be video dance.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.736
You go to the long duration chairs
because now you are comfortable.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.136
In the long duration chairs,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.856
you're transported to the big place
where you're going to see the work.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.096
And if you fall asleep,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.656
which is very possible
because it's been a long day,

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.136
you're going to be
transported to the parking lot.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.776
(Laughter)

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.616
And you know, sleeping is very important.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.416
In sleeping, you're still receiving art.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.136
So in the parking lot you stay
for a certain amount of time,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.416
and then after this
you just, you know, go back,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.776
you see more of the things you like to see

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.840
or go home with your certificate.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.696
So this institute right now is virtual.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.576
Right now, I am just
making my institute in Brazil,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.267
then it's going to be in Australia,

00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:14.416
then it's coming here,
to Canada and everywhere.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.936
And this is to experience
a kind of simple method,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.856
how you go back to simplicity
in your own life.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.840
Counting rice will be another thing.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.656
(Laughter)

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.176
You know, if you count rice
you can make life, too.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.376
How to count rice for six hours?

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.096
It's incredibly important.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.256
You know, you go through this whole range
of being bored, being angry,

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.736
being completely frustrated, not finishing
the amount of rice you're counting.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.536
And then this unbelievable
amount of peace you get

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.016
when satisfying work is finished --

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.840
or counting sand in the desert.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.096
Or having the sound-isolated situation --

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.696
that you have headphones,
that you don't hear anything,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.416
and you're just there
together without sound,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.296
with the people experiencing silence,
just the simple silence.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.536
We are always doing things
we like in our life.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.816
And this is why you're not changing.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.296
You do things in life --

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.720
it's just nothing happens
if you always do things the same way.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.296
But my method is to do things
I'm afraid of, the things I fear,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.816
the things I don't know,

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.696
to go to territory
that nobody's ever been.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.576
And then also to include the failure.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.336
I think failure is important

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.096
because if you go,
if you experiment, you can fail.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.776
If you don't go into that area
and you don't fail,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.800
you are actually repeating yourself
over and over again.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.136
And I think that human beings
right now need a change,

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.256
and the only change to be made
is a personal level change.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.856
You have to make the change on yourself.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.376
Because the only way
to change consciousness

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.416
and to change the world around us,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.136
is to start with yourself.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.656
It's so easy to criticize
how it's different,

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.823
the things in the world
and they're not right,

00:13:59.847 --> 00:14:03.096
and the governments are corrupted
and there's hunger in the world

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.576
and there's wars -- the killing.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.176
But what we do on the personal level --

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.160
what is our contribution
to this whole thing?

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.056
Can you turn to your neighbor,
the one you don't know,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.200
and look at them for two full minutes
in their eyes, right now?

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.336
(Chatter)

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.256
I'm asking two minutes
of your time, that's so little.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.616
Breathe slowly, don't try to blink,
don't be self-conscious.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.256
Be relaxed.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.680
And just look a complete
stranger in your eyes, in his eyes.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.280
(Silence)

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.680
Thank you for trusting me.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:32.560
(Applause)

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.960
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.040
Thank you so much.
