00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.903
It's often said that you can tell
a lot about a person

00:00:03.927 --> 00:00:06.422
by looking at what's on their bookshelves.

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:09.666
What do my bookshelves say about me?

00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:14.086
Well, when I asked myself
this question a few years ago,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.411
I made an alarming discovery.

00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:20.135
I'd always thought of myself
as a fairly cultured,

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:22.584
cosmopolitan sort of person.

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:25.704
But my bookshelves told
a rather different story.

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.091
Pretty much all the titles on them

00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:30.974
were by British or North American authors,

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.534
and there was almost
nothing in translation.

00:00:34.327 --> 00:00:38.177
Discovering this massive,
cultural blind spot in my reading

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:40.002
came as quite a shock.

00:00:40.026 --> 00:00:43.519
And when I thought about it,
it seemed like a real shame.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.915
I knew there had to be lots
of amazing stories out there

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:50.316
by writers working in languages
other than English.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.642
And it seemed really sad to think
that my reading habits meant

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.023
I would probably never encounter them.

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:59.301
So, I decided to prescribe myself

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.943
an intensive course of global reading.

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:06.340
2012 was set to be a very
international year for the UK;

00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:08.436
it was the year of the London Olympics.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.982
And so I decided to use it
as my time frame

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.213
to try to read a novel,
short story collection

00:01:15.237 --> 00:01:19.554
or memoir from every country in the world.

00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:22.104
And so I did.

00:01:22.128 --> 00:01:23.755
And it was very exciting

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:25.675
and I learned some remarkable things

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:27.814
and made some wonderful connections

00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:29.707
that I want to share with you today.

00:01:30.088 --> 00:01:33.286
But it started with some
practical problems.

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:38.516
After I'd worked out which of the many
different lists of countries in the world

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.746
to use for my project,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.920
I ended up going with the list
of UN-recognized nations,

00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:45.167
to which I added Taiwan,

00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:48.547
which gave me a total of 196 countries.

00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:51.998
And after I'd worked out
how to fit reading and blogging

00:01:52.022 --> 00:01:54.332
about, roughly, four books a week

00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:57.467
around working five days a week,

00:01:57.491 --> 00:02:01.195
I then had to face up to the fact
that I might even not be able

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.947
to get books in English
from every country.

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:08.291
Only around 4.5 percent
of the literary works published

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.966
each year in the UK are translations,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.616
and the figures are similar for much
of the English-speaking world.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.593
Although, the proportion
of translated books published

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:20.409
in many other countries is a lot higher.

00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:24.409
4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with,

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:26.268
but what that figure doesn't tell you

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:28.965
is that many of those books
will come from countries

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.163
with strong publishing networks

00:02:31.187 --> 00:02:35.354
and lots of industry professionals
primed to go out and sell those titles

00:02:35.378 --> 00:02:37.338
to English-language publishers.

00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:42.283
So, for example, although well over 100
books are translated from French

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:44.210
and published in the UK each year,

00:02:44.234 --> 00:02:48.647
most of them will come from countries
like France or Switzerland.

00:02:49.107 --> 00:02:51.845
French-speaking Africa, on the other hand,

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.511
will rarely ever get a look-in.

00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:57.607
The upshot is that there are
actually quite a lot of nations

00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:01.262
that may have little or even no
commercially available literature

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:02.439
in English.

00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:06.140
Their books remain invisible to readers

00:03:06.164 --> 00:03:09.002
of the world's most published language.

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:11.820
But when it came to reading the world,

00:03:11.844 --> 00:03:13.614
the biggest challenge of all for me

00:03:13.638 --> 00:03:16.772
was that fact that I didn't
know where to start.

00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.559
Having spent my life reading
almost exclusively British

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:22.232
and North American books,

00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:25.845
I had no idea how to go about
sourcing and finding stories

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.580
and choosing them from much
of the rest of the world.

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:31.989
I couldn't tell you how to source
a story from Swaziland.

00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:34.648
I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia.

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.718
There was no hiding it --

00:03:36.742 --> 00:03:40.065
I was a clueless literary xenophobe.

00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:42.995
So how on earth was I
going to read the world?

00:03:43.777 --> 00:03:45.634
I was going to have to ask for help.

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:49.157
So in October 2011, I registered my blog,

00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:50.952
ayearofreadingtheworld.com,

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:53.461
and I posted a short appeal online.

00:03:53.863 --> 00:03:55.092
I explained who I was,

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:57.124
how narrow my reading had been,

00:03:57.148 --> 00:03:59.005
and I asked anyone who cared to

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:01.594
to leave a message suggesting
what I might read

00:04:01.618 --> 00:04:03.302
from other parts of the planet.

00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:07.986
Now, I had no idea whether
anyone would be interested,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.124
but within a few hours
of me posting that appeal online,

00:04:11.148 --> 00:04:13.584
people started to get in touch.

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:16.106
At first, it was friends and colleagues.

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:18.017
Then it was friends of friends.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.660
And pretty soon, it was strangers.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.201
Four days after I put that appeal online,

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:27.956
I got a message from a woman
called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur.

00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:30.967
She said she loved
the sound of my project,

00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:33.890
could she go to her local
English-language bookshop

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:37.204
and choose my Malaysian book
and post it to me?

00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:39.665
I accepted enthusiastically,

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:41.191
and a few weeks later,

00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:45.763
a package arrived containing
not one, but two books --

00:04:47.263 --> 00:04:49.681
Rafidah's choice from Malaysia,

00:04:50.908 --> 00:04:54.791
and a book from Singapore
that she had also picked out for me.

00:04:56.428 --> 00:04:58.865
Now, at the time, I was amazed

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.465
that a stranger more than 6,000 miles away

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:04.414
would go to such lengths to help someone

00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:06.497
she would probably never meet.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.751
But Rafidah's kindness proved
to be the pattern for that year.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.530
Time and again, people went
out of their way to help me.

00:05:15.226 --> 00:05:17.835
Some took on research on my behalf,

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:20.882
and others made detours
on holidays and business trips

00:05:20.906 --> 00:05:22.842
to go to bookshops for me.

00:05:23.526 --> 00:05:26.762
It turns out, if you want
to read the world,

00:05:26.786 --> 00:05:30.187
if you want to encounter it
with an open mind,

00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:32.141
the world will help you.

00:05:33.118 --> 00:05:34.333
When it came to countries

00:05:34.357 --> 00:05:37.863
with little or no commercially
available literature in English,

00:05:37.887 --> 00:05:39.700
people went further still.

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:43.901
Books often came from surprising sources.

00:05:44.536 --> 00:05:47.575
My Panamanian read, for example,
came through a conversation

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.618
I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter.

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:55.007
Yes, the Panama Canal
has a Twitter account.

00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:58.105
And when I tweeted at it about my project,

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.508
it suggested that I might like to try
and get hold of the work

00:06:01.532 --> 00:06:04.111
of the Panamanian author
Juan David Morgan.

00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:07.468
I found Morgan's website
and I sent him a message,

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.924
asking if any of his
Spanish-language novels

00:06:09.948 --> 00:06:11.938
had been translated into English.

00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:14.863
And he said that nothing
had been published,

00:06:14.887 --> 00:06:17.317
but he did have an unpublished translation

00:06:17.341 --> 00:06:19.325
of his novel "The Golden Horse."

00:06:19.887 --> 00:06:21.225
He emailed this to me,

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:24.383
allowing me to become
one of the first people ever

00:06:24.407 --> 00:06:26.251
to read that book in English.

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:29.579
Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith

00:06:29.603 --> 00:06:31.593
to share his work with me in this way.

00:06:32.015 --> 00:06:33.777
From Sweden to Palau,

00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:37.792
writers and translators
sent me self-published books

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:39.546
and unpublished manuscripts of books

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.450
that hadn't been picked
up by Anglophone publishers

00:06:42.474 --> 00:06:44.496
or that were no longer available,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.228
giving me privileged glimpses
of some remarkable imaginary worlds.

00:06:50.008 --> 00:06:51.159
I read, for example,

00:06:51.183 --> 00:06:55.773
about the Southern African king
Ngungunhane, who led the resistance

00:06:55.797 --> 00:06:58.459
against the Portuguese
in the 19th century;

00:06:59.113 --> 00:07:01.884
and about marriage rituals
in a remote village

00:07:01.908 --> 00:07:04.906
on the shores of the Caspian sea
in Turkmenistan.

00:07:06.524 --> 00:07:10.133
I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.450
(Laughter)

00:07:13.301 --> 00:07:16.867
And I read about an orgy
in a tree in Angola.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.022
But perhaps the most amazing example

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:25.450
of the lengths that people
were prepared to go to

00:07:25.474 --> 00:07:27.101
to help me read the world,

00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:29.574
came towards the end of my quest,

00:07:29.598 --> 00:07:33.432
when I tried to get hold of a book
from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking

00:07:33.456 --> 00:07:36.723
African island nation
of São Tomé and Príncipe.

00:07:37.364 --> 00:07:41.013
Now, having spent several months
trying everything I could think of to find

00:07:41.037 --> 00:07:44.376
a book that had been translated
into English from the nation,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.642
it seemed as though
the only option left to me

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:49.873
was to see if I could get something
translated for me from scratch.

00:07:50.404 --> 00:07:51.905
Now, I was really dubious

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:54.325
whether anyone was going
to want to help with this,

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.848
and give up their time
for something like that.

00:07:57.525 --> 00:08:01.788
But, within a week of me putting
a call out on Twitter and Facebook

00:08:01.812 --> 00:08:03.766
for Portuguese speakers,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.361
I had more people than I could
involve in the project,

00:08:07.385 --> 00:08:11.743
including Margaret Jull Costa,
a leader in her field,

00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:17.068
who has translated the work
of Nobel Prize winner José Saramago.

00:08:18.443 --> 00:08:20.378
With my nine volunteers in place,

00:08:20.402 --> 00:08:22.990
I managed to find a book
by a São Toméan author

00:08:23.014 --> 00:08:25.524
that I could buy enough copies of online.

00:08:25.548 --> 00:08:26.702
Here's one of them.

00:08:27.268 --> 00:08:30.832
And I sent a copy out
to each of my volunteers.

00:08:30.856 --> 00:08:34.030
They all took on a couple
of short stories from this collection,

00:08:34.054 --> 00:08:37.681
stuck to their word, sent
their translations back to me,

00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:41.494
and within six weeks,
I had the entire book to read.

00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:46.884
In that case, as I found so often
during my year of reading the world,

00:08:46.908 --> 00:08:50.993
my not knowing and being open
about my limitations

00:08:51.017 --> 00:08:53.158
had become a big opportunity.

00:08:53.935 --> 00:08:56.122
When it came to São Tomé and Príncipe,

00:08:56.146 --> 00:08:59.492
it was a chance not only
to learn something new

00:08:59.516 --> 00:09:02.191
and discover a new collection of stories,

00:09:02.215 --> 00:09:05.161
but also to bring together
a group of people

00:09:05.185 --> 00:09:08.414
and facilitate a joint creative endeavor.

00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:12.801
My weakness had become
the project's strength.

00:09:13.929 --> 00:09:17.485
The books I read that year
opened my eyes to many things.

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:19.696
As those who enjoy reading will know,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.500
books have an extraordinary power
to take you out of yourself

00:09:23.524 --> 00:09:25.668
and into someone else's mindset,

00:09:25.692 --> 00:09:27.534
so that, for a while at least,

00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:29.783
you look at the world
through different eyes.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.853
That can be an uncomfortable experience,

00:09:32.877 --> 00:09:34.649
particularly if you're reading a book

00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:38.097
from a culture that may have quite
different values to your own.

00:09:38.601 --> 00:09:40.750
But it can also be really enlightening.

00:09:41.402 --> 00:09:45.316
Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas
can help clarify your own thinking.

00:09:45.742 --> 00:09:47.909
And it can also show up blind spots

00:09:47.933 --> 00:09:50.575
in the way you might have
been looking at the world.

00:09:51.072 --> 00:09:53.954
When I looked back at much
of the English-language literature

00:09:53.978 --> 00:09:55.664
I'd grown up with, for example,

00:09:55.688 --> 00:09:58.725
I began to see how narrow a lot of it was,

00:09:58.749 --> 00:10:01.561
compared to the richness
that the world has to offer.

00:10:02.886 --> 00:10:05.048
And as the pages turned,

00:10:05.072 --> 00:10:07.538
something else started to happen, too.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.301
Little by little,

00:10:09.325 --> 00:10:13.610
that long list of countries that
I'd started the year with, changed

00:10:13.634 --> 00:10:17.993
from a rather dry, academic
register of place names

00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:20.698
into living, breathing entities.

00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:24.198
Now, I don't want to suggest
that it's at all possible

00:10:24.222 --> 00:10:28.428
to get a rounded picture of a country
simply by reading one book.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.599
But cumulatively, the stories
I read that year

00:10:32.623 --> 00:10:35.683
made me more alive than ever before

00:10:35.707 --> 00:10:41.781
to the richness, diversity and complexity
of our remarkable planet.

00:10:42.654 --> 00:10:44.647
It was as though the world's stories

00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:48.571
and the people who'd gone
to such lengths to help me read them

00:10:48.595 --> 00:10:50.500
had made it real to me.

00:10:52.086 --> 00:10:54.621
These days, when I look at my bookshelves

00:10:54.645 --> 00:10:57.770
or consider the works on my e-reader,

00:10:57.794 --> 00:10:59.909
they tell a rather different story.

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:03.995
It's the story of the power
books have to connect us

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:08.764
across political, geographical,
cultural, social, religious divides.

00:11:09.422 --> 00:11:13.564
It's the tale of the potential
human beings have to work together.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.662
And, it's testament

00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:20.309
to the extraordinary times we live
in, where, thanks to the Internet,

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:22.250
it's easier than ever before

00:11:22.274 --> 00:11:26.703
for a stranger to share a story,
a worldview, a book

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:30.520
with someone she may never meet,
on the other side of the planet.

00:11:31.595 --> 00:11:34.693
I hope it's a story I'm reading
for many years to come.

00:11:35.074 --> 00:11:37.923
And I hope many more people will join me.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.561
If we all read more widely,
there'd be more incentive

00:11:40.585 --> 00:11:43.132
for publishers to translate more books,

00:11:43.156 --> 00:11:45.095
and we would all be richer for that.

00:11:45.713 --> 00:11:46.870
Thank you.

00:11:46.894 --> 00:11:50.628
(Applause)
