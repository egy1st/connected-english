00:00:08.056 --> 00:00:11.669
You might think there are
many things that I can't do

00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:13.604
because I cannot see.

00:00:14.326 --> 00:00:15.974
That's largely true.

00:00:15.998 --> 00:00:18.481
Actually, I just needed
to have a bit of help

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:20.339
to come up to the stage.

00:00:20.363 --> 00:00:23.291
But there is also a lot that I can do.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.142
This is me rock climbing
for the first time.

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:31.243
Actually, I love sports
and I can play many sports,

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:36.649
like swimming, skiing, skating,
scuba diving, running and so on.

00:00:37.382 --> 00:00:39.293
But there is one limitation:

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:41.904
somebody needs to help me.

00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:44.626
I want to be independent.

00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:50.444
I lost my sight at the age of 14
in a swimming pool accident.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.613
I was an active, independent teenager,

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:56.053
and suddenly I became blind.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.904
The hardest thing for me
was losing my independence.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.007
Things that until then seemed simple
became almost impossible to do alone.

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:11.703
For example, one of my
challenges was textbooks.

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:14.834
Back then, there were no
personal computers,

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:17.295
no Internet, no smartphones.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.752
So I had to ask one of my two brothers
to read me textbooks,

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:26.252
and I had to create
my own books in Braille.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.006
Can you imagine?

00:01:28.603 --> 00:01:31.722
Of course, my brothers
were not happy about it,

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:35.569
and later, I noticed they were not there
whenever I needed them.

00:01:35.593 --> 00:01:36.594
(Laughter)

00:01:36.618 --> 00:01:40.410
I think they tried to stay away from me.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.788
I don't blame them.

00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:46.352
I really wanted to be freed
from relying on someone.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.069
That became my strong desire
to ignite innovation.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.786
Jump ahead to the mid-1980s.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.556
I got to know cutting-edge technologies

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.677
and I thought to myself,

00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:03.320
how come there is no computer technology

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:05.470
to create books in Braille?

00:02:06.288 --> 00:02:10.652
These amazing technologies
must be able to also help people

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:13.075
with limitations like myself.

00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:17.617
That's the moment
my innovation journey began.

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:22.540
I started developing
digital book technologies,

00:02:22.564 --> 00:02:27.857
such as a digital Braille editor,
digital Braille dictionary

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.627
and a digital Braille library network.

00:02:31.178 --> 00:02:35.546
Today, every student who is visually
impaired can read textbooks,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.397
by using personal computers
and mobile devices,

00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:41.506
in Braille or in voice.

00:02:41.998 --> 00:02:44.134
This may not surprise you,

00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:49.218
since everyone now has digital books
in their tablets in 2015.

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:55.089
But Braille went digital
many years before digital books,

00:02:55.113 --> 00:03:00.345
already in the late 1980s,
almost 30 years ago.

00:03:01.242 --> 00:03:05.041
Strong and specific needs
of the blind people

00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:10.708
made this opportunity to create
digital books way back then.

00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:16.349
And this is actually not
the first time this happened,

00:03:16.373 --> 00:03:22.463
because history shows us
accessibility ignites innovation.

00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:27.484
The telephone was invented
while developing a communication tool

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.375
for hearing impaired people.

00:03:29.737 --> 00:03:35.157
Some keyboards were also invented
to help people with disabilities.

00:03:36.807 --> 00:03:40.284
Now I'm going to give you
another example from my own life.

00:03:40.688 --> 00:03:44.951
In the '90s, people around me
started talking about the Internet

00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:46.418
and web browsing.

00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:49.767
I remember the first time
I went on the web.

00:03:50.148 --> 00:03:51.736
I was astonished.

00:03:52.352 --> 00:03:56.459
I could access newspapers
at any time and every day.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.666
I could even search
for any information by myself.

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:06.989
I desperately wanted to help the blind
people have access to the Internet,

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:12.319
and I found ways to render the web
into synthesized voice,

00:04:12.343 --> 00:04:16.113
which dramatically simplified
the user interface.

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:22.095
This led me to develop
the Home Page Reader in 1997,

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:27.012
first in Japanese and later,
translated into 11 languages.

00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:30.361
When I developed the Home Page Reader,

00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:33.314
I got many comments from users.

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.435
One that I strongly remember said,

00:04:37.032 --> 00:04:42.280
"For me, the Internet
is a small window to the world."

00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:46.126
It was a revolutionary moment
for the blind.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.307
The cyber world became accessible,

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:54.001
and this technology that we created
for the blind has many uses,

00:04:54.025 --> 00:04:56.000
way beyond what I imagined.

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.685
It can help drivers listen to their emails

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:04.982
or it can help you listen
to a recipe while cooking.

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:08.626
Today, I am more independent,

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.966
but it is still not enough.

00:05:11.668 --> 00:05:17.523
For example, when I approached
the stage just now, I needed assistance.

00:05:18.412 --> 00:05:21.833
My goal is to come up here independently.

00:05:22.147 --> 00:05:23.674
And not just here.

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:29.810
My goal is to be able to travel
and do things that are simple to you.

00:05:30.638 --> 00:05:33.447
OK, now let me show you
the latest technologies.

00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:36.995
This is a smartphone app
that we are working on.

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:42.259
(Video) Electronic voice: 51 feet
to the door, and keep straight.

00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:48.825
EV: Take the two doors to go out.
The door is on your right.

00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:57.669
EV: Nick is approaching. Looks so happy.

00:05:57.693 --> 00:05:58.898
Chieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick!

00:05:58.922 --> 00:05:59.923
(Laughter)

00:05:59.947 --> 00:06:02.090
CA: Where are you going?
You look so happy.

00:06:02.114 --> 00:06:04.227
Nick: Oh -- well, my paper
just got accepted.

00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:05.898
CA: That's great! Congratulations.

00:06:05.922 --> 00:06:09.573
Nick: Thanks. Wait -- how'd you know
it was me, and that I look happy?

00:06:09.597 --> 00:06:10.947
(Chieko and Nick laugh)

00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:12.130
Man: Hi.

00:06:12.154 --> 00:06:13.871
(Laughter)

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:15.046
CA: Oh ... hi.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.387
EV: He is not talking to you,
but on his phone.

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:25.616
EV: Potato chips.

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.762
EV: Dark chocolate with almonds.

00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:39.676
EV: You gained 5 pounds since yesterday;
take apple instead of chocolate.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.866
(Laughter)

00:06:42.456 --> 00:06:43.768
EV: Approaching.

00:06:48.038 --> 00:06:49.214
EV: You arrived.

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:52.178
CA: Now ...

00:06:52.202 --> 00:06:56.130
(Applause)

00:06:56.154 --> 00:06:57.345
Thank you.

00:06:57.369 --> 00:07:00.267
So now the app navigates me

00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:04.307
by analyzing beacon signals
and smartphone sensors

00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:09.467
and permits me to move around
indoor and outdoor environments

00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:11.079
all by myself.

00:07:11.103 --> 00:07:15.951
But the computer vision part
that showed who is approaching,

00:07:15.975 --> 00:07:19.481
in which mood -- we are still
working on that part.

00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:26.657
And recognizing facial expressions
is very important for me to be social.

00:07:27.398 --> 00:07:33.564
So now the fusions of technologies
are ready to help me

00:07:33.588 --> 00:07:35.268
see the real world.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.149
We call this cognitive assistance.

00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:43.140
It understands our surrounding world

00:07:43.164 --> 00:07:49.381
and whispers to me in voice
or sends a vibration to my fingers.

00:07:50.088 --> 00:07:56.152
Cognitive assistance will augment
missing or weakened abilities --

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:58.807
in other words, our five senses.

00:07:59.464 --> 00:08:02.775
This technology is only in an early stage,

00:08:02.799 --> 00:08:07.576
but eventually, I'll be able to find
a classroom on campus,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.354
enjoy window shopping

00:08:09.378 --> 00:08:13.239
or find a nice restaurant
while walking along a street.

00:08:14.088 --> 00:08:18.715
It will be amazing if I can find you
on the street before you notice me.

00:08:19.595 --> 00:08:23.382
It will become my best buddy, and yours.

00:08:24.308 --> 00:08:27.898
So, this really is a great challenge.

00:08:28.395 --> 00:08:32.364
It is a challenge
that needs collaboration,

00:08:32.388 --> 00:08:35.290
which is why we are creating
an open community

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:38.173
to accelerate research activities.

00:08:39.192 --> 00:08:44.090
Just this morning, we announced
the open-source fundamental technologies

00:08:44.114 --> 00:08:45.741
you just saw in the video.

00:08:46.487 --> 00:08:49.251
The frontier is the real world.

00:08:49.878 --> 00:08:54.291
The blind community is exploring
this technical frontier

00:08:54.315 --> 00:08:56.021
and the pathfinder.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:00.297
I hope to work with you
to explore the new era,

00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:03.408
and the next time that I'm on this stage,

00:09:03.432 --> 00:09:05.846
through technology and innovation,

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.895
I will be able to walk up here

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:09.515
all by myself.

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:10.778
Thank you so much.

00:09:10.802 --> 00:09:16.420
(Applause)
