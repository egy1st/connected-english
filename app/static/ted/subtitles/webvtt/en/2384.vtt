00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.216
What does a working mother look like?

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.496
If you ask the Internet,
this is what you'll be told.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.950
Never mind that this is
what you'll actually produce

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.856
if you attempt to work at a computer
with a baby on your lap.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.416
(Laughter)

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.336
But no, this isn't a working mother.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.536
You'll notice a theme in these photos.
We'll look at a lot of them.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.976
That theme is amazing natural lighting,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.136
which, as we all know,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.336
is the hallmark
of every American workplace.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.816
There are thousands of images like these.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.256
Just put the term "working mother"
into any Google image search engine,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.536
stock photo site.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.016
They're all over the Internet,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.416
they're topping
blog posts and news pieces,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.776
and I've become kind of obsessed with them
and the lie that they tell us

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.776
and the comfort that they give us,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.216
that when it comes
to new working motherhood in America,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.016
everything's fine.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.616
But it's not fine.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.056
As a country, we are sending
millions of women back to work

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.016
every year, incredibly
and kind of horrifically soon

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.696
after they give birth.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.416
That's a moral problem

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.336
but today I'm also going to tell you
why it's an economic problem.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.976
I got so annoyed and obsessed
with the unreality of these images,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.016
which look nothing like my life,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.216
that I recently decided to shoot and star
in a parody series of stock photos

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.376
that I hoped the world would start to use

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.656
just showing the really awkward reality
of going back to work

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.240
when your baby's food source
is attached to your body.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.696
I'm just going to show you two of them.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.776
(Laughter)

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.896
Nothing says "Give that girl a promotion"
like leaking breast milk

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.056
through your dress during a presentation.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.496
You'll notice that there's
no baby in this photo,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.136
because that's not how this works,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.496
not for most working mothers.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.576
Did you know, and this will ruin your day,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.776
that every time a toilet is flushed,
its contents are aerosolized

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.216
and they'll stay airborne for hours?

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.976
And yet, for many new working mothers,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.256
this is the only place during the day
that they can find to make food

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.600
for their newborn babies.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.336
I put these things,
a whole dozen of them, into the world.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.976
I wanted to make a point.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.416
I didn't know what I was also doing
was opening a door,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.976
because now, total strangers
from all walks of life

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.936
write to me all the time

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.816
just to tell me what it's like
for them to go back to work

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.856
within days or weeks of having a baby.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.456
I'm going to share
10 of their stories with you today.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.856
They are totally real,
some of them are very raw,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.920
and not one of them
looks anything like this.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.136
Here's the first.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.856
"I was an active duty
service member at a federal prison.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.256
I returned to work after the maximum
allowed eight weeks for my C-section.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.336
A male coworker was annoyed
that I had been out on 'vacation,'

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.789
so he intentionally opened the door on me
while I was pumping breast milk

00:02:55.813 --> 00:02:59.856
and stood in the doorway
with inmates in the hallway."

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.176
Most of the stories that these women,
total strangers, send to me now,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.456
are not actually even about breastfeeding.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.376
A woman wrote to me to say,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.176
"I gave birth to twins and went back
to work after seven unpaid weeks.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.856
Emotionally, I was a wreck.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.216
Physically, I had a severe hemorrhage
during labor, and major tearing,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.976
so I could barely get up, sit or walk.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.856
My employer told me I wasn't allowed
to use my available vacation days

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.640
because it was budget season."

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.416
I've come to believe that we can't look
situations like these in the eye

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.256
because then we'd be horrified,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.336
and if we get horrified
then we have to do something about it.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.216
So we choose to look at,
and believe, this image.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.696
I don't really know
what's going on in this picture,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.376
because I find it weird
and slightly creepy.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.816
(Laughter)

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.056
Like, what is she doing?

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.096
But I know what it tells us.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.656
It tells us that everything's fine.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.416
This working mother, all working mothers
and all of their babies, are fine.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.416
There's nothing to see here.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.856
And anyway, women have made a choice,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.176
so none of it's even our problem.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.136
I want to break this choice thing
down into two parts.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.776
The first choice says
that women have chosen to work.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.016
So, that's not true.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.255
Today in America, women make up
47 percent of the workforce,

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.256
and in 40 percent of American households

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.816
a woman is the sole
or primary breadwinner.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.376
Our paid work is a part, a huge part,
of the engine of this economy,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.176
and it is essential
for the engines of our families.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.376
On a national level,
our paid work is not optional.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.336
Choice number two says that women
are choosing to have babies,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.480
so women alone should bear
the consequences of those choices.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.976
You know, that's one of those things

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.456
that when you hear it in passing,
can sound correct.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.909
I didn't make you have a baby.

00:04:51.933 --> 00:04:54.016
I certainly wasn't there
when that happened.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.056
But that stance
ignores a fundamental truth,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.976
which is that our procreation
on a national scale is not optional.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.496
The babies that women, many of them
working women, are having today,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.736
will one day fill our workforce,
protect our shores,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.576
make up our tax base.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.776
Our procreation
on a national scale is not optional.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.176
These aren't choices.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.016
We need women to work.
We need working women to have babies.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.517
So we should make
doing those things at the same time

00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:27.941
at least palatable, right?

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.656
OK, this is pop quiz time:

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.616
what percentage of working
women in America do you think

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.160
have no access to paid maternity leave?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.640
88 percent.

00:05:41.873 --> 00:05:45.016
88 percent of working mothers
will not get one minute of paid leave

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.656
after they have a baby.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.296
So now you're thinking about unpaid leave.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.896
It exists in America.
It's called FMLA. It does not work.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.896
Because of the way it's structured,
all kinds of exceptions,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.936
half of new mothers are ineligible for it.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.294
Here's what that looks like.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.136
"We adopted our son.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.376
When I got the call, the day he was born,
I had to take off work.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.536
I had not been there long enough
to qualify for FMLA,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.296
so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.736
When I took time off
to meet my newborn son,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.960
I lost my job."

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.736
These corporate stock photos
hide another reality, another layer.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.376
Of those who do have access
to just that unpaid leave,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.576
most women can't afford
to take much of it at all.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.096
A nurse told me, "I didn't qualify
for short-term disability

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.176
because my pregnancy
was considered a preexisting condition.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.867
We used up all of our tax returns
and half of our savings

00:06:43.891 --> 00:06:45.736
during my six unpaid weeks.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.496
We just couldn't manage any longer.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.056
Physically it was hard,
but emotionally it was worse.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.056
I struggled for months
being away from my son."

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.976
So this decision
to go back to work so early,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.176
it's a rational economic decision
driven by family finances,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.456
but it's often physically horrific

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.016
because putting a human
into the world is messy.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.456
A waitress told me,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.016
"With my first baby, I was back
at work five weeks postpartum.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.096
With my second, I had to have
major surgery after giving birth,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.136
so I waited until six weeks to go back.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.240
I had third degree tears."

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.936
23 percent of new
working mothers in America

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.560
will be back on the job
within two weeks of giving birth.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.976
"I worked as a bartender and cook,
average of 75 hours a week while pregnant.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.616
I had to return to work
before my baby was a month old,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.656
working 60 hours a week.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.736
One of my coworkers was only able
to afford 10 days off with her baby."

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.936
Of course, this isn't just a scenario
with economic and physical implications.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.136
Childbirth is, and always will be,
an enormous psychological event.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.256
A teacher told me,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.256
"I returned to work
eight weeks after my son was born.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.176
I already suffer from anxiety,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.296
but the panic attacks I had prior
to returning to work were unbearable."

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.416
Statistically speaking,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.136
the shorter a woman's leave
after having a baby,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.376
the more likely she will be to suffer
from postpartum mood disorders

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.496
like depression and anxiety,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.536
and among many potential
consequences of those disorders,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.696
suicide is the second
most common cause of death

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.600
in a woman's first year postpartum.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.816
Heads up that this next story --

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.416
I've never met this woman,
but I find it hard to get through.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.616
"I feel tremendous grief and rage
that I lost an essential,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.496
irreplaceable and formative
time with my son.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.936
Labor and delivery
left me feeling absolutely broken.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.616
For months, all I remember
is the screaming: colic, they said.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.776
On the inside, I was drowning.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.496
Every morning, I asked myself
how much longer I could do it.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.696
I was allowed to bring my baby to work.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.856
I closed my office door
while I rocked and shushed

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.376
and begged him to stop screaming
so I wouldn't get in trouble.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.456
I hid behind that office door
every damn day

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.416
and cried while he screamed.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.096
I cried in the bathroom
while I washed out the pump equipment.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.256
Every day, I cried all the way to work
and all the way home again.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.416
I promised my boss that the work
I didn't get done during the day,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.096
I'd make up at night from home.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.920
I thought, there's just something
wrong with me that I can't swing this."

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.136
So those are the mothers.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.936
What of the babies?

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.456
As a country, do we care
about the millions of babies

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.336
born every year to working mothers?

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.696
I say we don't,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.176
not until they're of working
and tax-paying and military-serving age.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.105
We tell them we'll see them in 18 years,

00:09:42.129 --> 00:09:43.891
and getting there is kind of on them.

00:09:45.854 --> 00:09:48.616
One of the reasons I know this
is that babies whose mothers

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.936
have 12 or more weeks at home with them

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.936
are more likely to get their vaccinations
and their well checks in their first year,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.656
so those babies are more protected
from deadly and disabling diseases.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.920
But those things are hidden
behind images like this.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:11.776
America has a message for new mothers
who work and for their babies.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.576
Whatever time you get together,
you should be grateful for it,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.336
and you're an inconvenience

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.376
to the economy and to your employers.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.936
That narrative of gratitude
runs through a lot of the stories I hear.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.616
A woman told me,

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.816
"I went back at eight weeks
after my C-section

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.656
because my husband was out of work.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.416
Without me, my daughter
had failure to thrive.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.736
She wouldn't take a bottle.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.376
She started losing weight.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.216
Thankfully, my manager
was very understanding.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.776
He let my mom bring my baby,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.096
who was on oxygen and a monitor,

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.240
four times a shift so I could nurse her."

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.336
There's a little club
of countries in the world

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.216
that offer no national
paid leave to new mothers.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.696
Care to guess who they are?

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.656
The first eight make up eight million
in total population.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.176
They are Papua New Guinea,
Suriname and the tiny island nations

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:11.416
of Micronesia, Marshall Islands,
Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tonga.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.816
Number nine is
the United States of America,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.920
with 320 million people.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.656
Oh, that's it.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.256
That's the end of the list.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.896
Every other economy on the planet

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.816
has found a way to make some level
of national paid leave work

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.816
for the people doing the work
of the future of those countries,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.896
but we say,
"We couldn't possibly do that."

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.416
We say that the market
will solve this problem,

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.776
and then we cheer when corporations
offer even more paid leave to the women

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.056
who are already the highest-educated
and highest-paid among us.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.896
Remember that 88 percent?

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.760
Those middle- and low-income women
are not going to participate in that.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.336
We know that there are staggering
economic, financial, physical

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.896
and emotional costs to this approach.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.936
We have decided --
decided, not an accident,

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.896
to pass these costs directly
on to working mothers and their babies.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.576
We know the price tag is higher
for low-income women,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.376
therefore disproportionately
for women of color.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.856
We pass them on anyway.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.496
All of this is to America's shame.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.416
But it's also to America's risk.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.336
Because what would happen

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.416
if all of these individual
so-called choices to have babies

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.440
started to turn into individual choices
not to have babies.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.016
One woman told me,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.296
"New motherhood is hard.
It shouldn't be traumatic.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.576
When we talk about expanding
our family now,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.896
we focus on how much time I would have
to care for myself and a new baby.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.216
If we were to have to do it again
the same way as with our first,

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.880
we might stick with one kid."

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.696
The birthrate needed in America
to keep the population stable

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.856
is 2.1 live births per woman.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.856
In America today, we are at 1.86.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.176
We need women to have babies,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.736
and we are actively disincentivizing
working women from doing that.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.976
What would happen to work force,
to innovation, to GDP,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.136
if one by one, the working mothers
of this country were to decide

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.520
that they can't bear
to do this thing more than once?

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.176
I'm here today with only
one idea worth spreading,

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.336
and you've guessed what it is.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.056
It is long since time
for the most powerful country on Earth

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.136
to offer national paid leave

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.875
to the people doing the work
of the future of this country

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:36.776
and to the babies
who represent that future.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.936
Childbirth is a public good.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.496
This leave should be state-subsidized.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.016
It should have no exceptions
for small businesses,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.496
length of employment or entrepreneurs.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.896
It should be able
to be shared between partners.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.896
I've talked today a lot about mothers,

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.600
but co-parents matter on so many levels.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.616
Not one more woman
should have to go back to work

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.816
while she is hobbling and bleeding.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.496
Not one more family should have
to drain their savings account

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.176
to buy a few days
of rest and recovery and bonding.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.496
Not one more fragile infant

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.456
should have to go directly
from the incubator to day care

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.176
because his parents have used up
all of their meager time

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.816
sitting in the NICU.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.698
Not one more working family
should be told that the collision

00:14:21.722 --> 00:14:26.056
of their work, their needed work
and their needed parenthood,

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.560
is their problem alone.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.416
The catch is that when this is happening
to a new family, it is consuming,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.216
and a family with a new baby
is more financially vulnerable

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.696
than they've ever been before,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.656
so that new mother cannot afford
to speak up on her own behalf.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.896
But all of us have voices.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.496
I am done, done having babies,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.376
and you might be pre-baby,

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.776
you might be post-baby,

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.416
you might be no baby.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.296
It should not matter.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.736
We have to stop framing this
as a mother's issue,

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.456
or even a women's issue.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.040
This is an American issue.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.696
We need to stop buying the lie
that these images tell us.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.976
We need to stop being comforted by them.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.656
We need to question
why we're told that this can't work

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.976
when we see it work
everywhere all over the world.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.776
We need to recognize
that this American reality

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.416
is to our dishonor and to our peril.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.616
Because this is not,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.256
this is not,

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.760
and this is not
what a working mother looks like.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.920
(Applause)
