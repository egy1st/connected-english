00:00:00.836 --> 00:00:03.124
What was the most
difficult job you ever did?

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:05.164
Was it working in the sun?

00:00:05.564 --> 00:00:08.350
Was it working to provide food
for a family or a community?

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:13.069
Was it working days and nights
trying to protect lives and property?

00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:14.852
Was it working alone

00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:18.256
or working on a project
that wasn't guaranteed to succeed,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.097
but that might improve
human health or save a life?

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:26.670
Was it working to build something,
create something, make a work of art?

00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:28.978
Was it work for which you were never sure

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.253
you were fully understood or appreciated?

00:00:33.113 --> 00:00:35.369
The people in our communities
who do these jobs

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:39.026
deserve our attention, our love
and our deepest support.

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:41.860
But people aren't the only ones
in our communities

00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:43.686
who do these difficult jobs.

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:46.876
These jobs are also done
by the plants, the animals

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.332
and the ecosystems on our planet,

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:52.845
including the ecosystems I study:
the tropical coral reefs.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.602
Coral reefs are farmers.

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:58.836
They provide food, income
and food security

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.423
for hundreds of millions
of people around the world.

00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:04.157
Coral reefs are security guards.

00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:06.938
The structures that they build
protect our shorelines

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:08.819
from storm surge and waves,

00:01:08.843 --> 00:01:12.509
and the biological systems
that they house filter the water

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.932
and make it safer for us to work and play.

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:18.114
Coral reefs are chemists.

00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:21.907
The molecules that we're discovering
on coral reefs are increasingly important

00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:25.504
in the search for new antibiotics
and new cancer drugs.

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:27.683
And coral reefs are artists.

00:01:27.707 --> 00:01:29.202
The structures that they build

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:31.776
are some of the most
beautiful things on planet Earth.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.586
And this beauty is the foundation
of the tourism industry

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.131
in many countries with few
or little other natural resources.

00:01:39.877 --> 00:01:43.137
So for all of these reasons,
all of these ecosystem services,

00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:45.846
economists estimate the value
of the world's coral reefs

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.866
in the hundreds of billions
of dollars per year.

00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.378
And yet despite all that hard work
being done for us

00:01:52.402 --> 00:01:54.598
and all that wealth that we gain,

00:01:54.622 --> 00:01:59.067
we have done almost everything
we possibly could to destroy that.

00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:01.044
We have taken the fish out of the oceans

00:02:01.068 --> 00:02:03.666
and we have added in fertilizer, sewage,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.589
diseases, oil, pollution, sediments.

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:11.486
We have trampled the reefs physically
with our boats, our fins, our bulldozers,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.017
and we have changed the chemistry
of the entire sea,

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:16.669
warmed the waters and made storms worse.

00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:18.844
And these would all be bad on their own,

00:02:18.868 --> 00:02:20.626
but these threats magnify each other

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.606
and compound one another
and make each other worse.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.023
I'll give you an example.

00:02:25.047 --> 00:02:29.372
Where I live and work, in Curaçao,
a tropical storm went by a few years ago.

00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:31.285
And on the eastern end of the island,

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.253
where the reefs are intact and thriving,

00:02:33.277 --> 00:02:36.236
you could barely tell
a tropical storm had passed.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.585
But in town, where corals had died
from overfishing, from pollution,

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.712
the tropical storm picked up
the dead corals

00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:46.678
and used them as bludgeons
to kill the corals that were left.

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:49.678
This is a coral that I studied
during my PhD --

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.271
I got to know it quite well.

00:02:51.295 --> 00:02:54.374
And after this storm
took off half of its tissue,

00:02:54.398 --> 00:02:56.067
it became infested with algae,

00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:58.846
the algae overgrew the tissue
and that coral died.

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:03.378
This magnification of threats,
this compounding of factors

00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:08.236
is what Jeremy Jackson describes
as the "slippery slope to slime."

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.252
It's hardly even a metaphor
because many of our reefs now

00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:15.840
are literally bacteria
and algae and slime.

00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:18.566
Now, this is the part of the talk

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.479
where you may expect me
to launch into my plea

00:03:21.503 --> 00:03:24.176
for us to all save the coral reefs.

00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:26.943
But I have a confession to make:

00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:30.339
that phrase drives me nuts.

00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:34.054
Whether I see it in a tweet,
in a news headline

00:03:34.078 --> 00:03:37.665
or the glossy pages
of a conservation brochure,

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.512
that phrase bothers me,

00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:42.464
because we as conservationists
have been sounding the alarms

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.892
about the death
of coral reefs for decades.

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:48.976
And yet, almost everyone I meet,
no matter how educated,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.823
is not sure what a coral is
or where they come from.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.814
How would we get someone to care
about the world's coral reefs

00:03:56.838 --> 00:04:00.507
when it's an abstract thing
they can barely understand?

00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:04.443
If they don't understand
what a coral is or where it comes from,

00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:07.134
or how funny or interesting
or beautiful it is,

00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:09.797
why would we expect them
to care about saving them?

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.828
So let's change that.

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:14.393
What is a coral
and where does it come from?

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:17.455
Corals are born
in a number of different ways,

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.702
but most often by mass spawning:
all of the individuals of a single species

00:04:21.726 --> 00:04:23.062
on one night a year,

00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:25.799
releasing all the eggs
they've made that year

00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:27.017
into the water column,

00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.485
packaged into bundles with sperm cells.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.985
And those bundles go to the surface
of the ocean and break apart.

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.755
And hopefully -- hopefully --
at the surface of the ocean,

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:38.000
they meet the eggs and sperm
from other corals.

00:04:38.024 --> 00:04:41.132
And that is why you need
lots of corals on a coral reef --

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:44.700
so that all of their eggs can
meet their match at the surface.

00:04:45.254 --> 00:04:48.362
When they're fertilized, they do
what any other animal egg does:

00:04:48.386 --> 00:04:50.631
divides in half again and again and again.

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:53.537
Taking these photos
under the microscope every year

00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:56.729
is one of my favorite and most
magical moments of the year.

00:04:56.753 --> 00:05:00.706
At the end of all this cell division,
they turn into a swimming larva --

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.464
a little tiny blob of fat
the size of a poppy seed,

00:05:04.488 --> 00:05:07.158
but with all of the sensory
systems that we have.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:12.838
They can sense color and light,
textures, chemicals, pH.

00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:15.863
They can even feel pressure waves;
they can hear sound.

00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:17.547
And they use those talents

00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:20.404
to search the bottom of the reef
for a place to attach

00:05:20.428 --> 00:05:22.027
and live the rest of their lives.

00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:25.427
So imagine finding a place
where you would live the rest of your life

00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:27.224
when you were just two days old.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.547
They attach in the place
they find most suitable,

00:05:30.571 --> 00:05:32.650
they build a skeleton
underneath themselves,

00:05:32.674 --> 00:05:34.263
they build a mouth and tentacles,

00:05:34.287 --> 00:05:38.390
and then they begin the difficult work
of building the world's coral reefs.

00:05:39.124 --> 00:05:42.969
One coral polyp will divide itself
again and again and again,

00:05:42.993 --> 00:05:45.334
leaving a limestone skeleton
underneath itself

00:05:45.358 --> 00:05:47.423
and growing up toward the sun.

00:05:47.906 --> 00:05:50.628
Given hundreds of years and many species,

00:05:50.652 --> 00:05:52.990
what you get is a massive
limestone structure

00:05:53.014 --> 00:05:55.526
that can be seen from space in many cases,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.918
covered by a thin skin
of these hardworking animals.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:04.030
Now, there are only a few hundred species
of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000.

00:06:04.435 --> 00:06:09.169
But these systems house millions
and millions of other species,

00:06:09.193 --> 00:06:11.677
and that diversity is what
stabilizes the systems,

00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:13.915
and it's where we're finding
our new medicines.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.008
It's how we find new sources of food.

00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:20.182
I'm lucky enough to work
on the island of Curaçao,

00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:22.462
where we still have reefs
that look like this.

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:26.797
But, indeed, much of the Caribbean
and much of our world

00:06:26.821 --> 00:06:28.687
is much more like this.

00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:31.734
Scientists have studied
in increasing detail

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.540
the loss of the world's coral reefs,

00:06:33.564 --> 00:06:37.125
and they have documented
with increasing certainty the causes.

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:40.141
But in my research, I'm not
interested in looking backward.

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:43.226
My colleagues and I in Curaçao
are interested in looking forward

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.607
at what might be.

00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:48.293
And we have the tiniest reason
to be optimistic.

00:06:48.824 --> 00:06:50.601
Because even in some of these reefs

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:54.274
that we probably could have
written off long ago,

00:06:54.298 --> 00:06:58.763
we sometimes see baby corals
arrive and survive anyway.

00:06:59.193 --> 00:07:02.468
And we're starting to think
that baby corals may have the ability

00:07:02.492 --> 00:07:06.095
to adjust to some of the conditions
that the adults couldn't.

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:08.135
They may be able to adjust

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:12.041
ever so slightly more readily
to this human planet.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.933
So in the research I do
with my colleagues in Curaçao,

00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:19.470
we try to figure out
what a baby coral needs

00:07:19.494 --> 00:07:21.018
in that critical early stage,

00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:22.209
what it's looking for

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.773
and how we can try to help it
through that process.

00:07:24.797 --> 00:07:27.638
I'm going to show you three examples
of the work we've done

00:07:27.662 --> 00:07:29.599
to try to answer those questions.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:35.350
A few years ago we took a 3D printer
and we made coral choice surveys --

00:07:35.374 --> 00:07:37.310
different colors and different textures,

00:07:37.334 --> 00:07:40.204
and we simply asked the coral
where they preferred to settle.

00:07:40.228 --> 00:07:43.213
And we found that corals,
even without the biology involved,

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:46.396
still prefer white and pink,
the colors of a healthy reef.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.555
And they prefer crevices
and grooves and holes,

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:51.603
where they will be safe
from being trampled

00:07:51.627 --> 00:07:52.943
or eaten by a predator.

00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:54.732
So we can use this knowledge,

00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:57.775
we can go back and say
we need to restore those factors --

00:07:57.799 --> 00:08:00.978
that pink, that white, those crevices,
those hard surfaces --

00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:02.745
in our conservation projects.

00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:04.230
We can also use that knowledge

00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:07.793
if we're going to put something
underwater, like a sea wall or a pier.

00:08:07.817 --> 00:08:10.857
We can choose to use the materials
and colors and textures

00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:14.712
that might bias the system
back toward those corals.

00:08:15.487 --> 00:08:17.464
Now in addition to the surfaces,

00:08:17.488 --> 00:08:19.985
we also study the chemical
and microbial signals

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:22.037
that attract corals to reefs.

00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:24.961
Starting about six years ago,
I began culturing bacteria

00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:27.077
from surfaces where corals had settled.

00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:29.934
And I tried those one by one by one,

00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.724
looking for the bacteria that would
convince corals to settle and attach.

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:37.898
And we now have many
bacterial strains in our freezer

00:08:37.922 --> 00:08:39.431
that will reliably cause corals

00:08:39.455 --> 00:08:42.424
to go through that settlement
and attachment process.

00:08:42.448 --> 00:08:43.647
So as we speak,

00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:46.091
my colleagues in Curaçao
are testing those bacteria

00:08:46.115 --> 00:08:49.439
to see if they'll help us raise
more coral settlers in the lab,

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:52.050
and to see if those coral settlers
will survive better

00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:53.883
when we put them back underwater.

00:08:54.304 --> 00:08:57.529
Now in addition to these tools,
we also try to uncover the mysteries

00:08:57.553 --> 00:09:00.006
of species that are under-studied.

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:04.128
This is one of my favorite corals,
and always has been:

00:09:04.152 --> 00:09:06.641
dendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral.

00:09:07.073 --> 00:09:09.980
I love it because it makes
this ridiculous shape,

00:09:10.004 --> 00:09:13.147
because its tentacles
are fat and look fuzzy

00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:14.611
and because it's rare.

00:09:14.635 --> 00:09:17.109
Finding one of these on a reef is a treat.

00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:18.847
In fact, it's so rare,

00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:21.387
that last year it was listed
as a threatened species

00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:23.266
on the endangered species list.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.597
And this was in part because
in over 30 years of research surveys,

00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:30.477
scientists had never found
a baby pillar coral.

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:33.217
We weren't even sure
if they could still reproduce,

00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.240
or if they were still reproducing.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.429
So four years ago, we started
following these at night

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:42.742
and watching to see if we could
figure out when they spawn in Curaçao.

00:09:43.992 --> 00:09:46.680
We got some good tips
from our colleagues in Florida,

00:09:46.704 --> 00:09:50.762
who had seen one in 2007, one in 2008,

00:09:50.786 --> 00:09:53.459
and eventually we figured out
when they spawn in Curaçao

00:09:53.483 --> 00:09:54.842
and we caught it.

00:09:54.866 --> 00:09:57.564
Here's a female on the left
with some eggs in her tissue,

00:09:57.588 --> 00:09:59.508
about to release them into the seawater.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:02.169
And here's a male
on the right, releasing sperm.

00:10:02.783 --> 00:10:06.467
We collected this, we got it
back to the lab, we got it to fertilize

00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:09.775
and we got baby pillar corals
swimming in our lab.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.060
Thanks to the work
of our scientific aunts and uncles,

00:10:13.084 --> 00:10:15.941
and thanks to the 10 years of practice
we've had in Curaçao

00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:18.158
at raising other coral species,

00:10:18.182 --> 00:10:22.057
we got some of those larvae
to go through the rest of the process

00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:23.733
and settle and attach,

00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:26.468
and turn into metamorphosed corals.

00:10:26.492 --> 00:10:31.236
So this is the first pillar coral baby
that anyone ever saw.

00:10:31.786 --> 00:10:37.206
(Applause)

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.404
And I have to say --
if you think baby pandas are cute,

00:10:40.428 --> 00:10:41.666
this is cuter.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.673
(Laughter)

00:10:44.236 --> 00:10:47.360
So we're starting to figure out
the secrets to this process,

00:10:47.384 --> 00:10:50.732
the secrets of coral reproduction
and how we might help them.

00:10:51.089 --> 00:10:52.937
And this is true all around the world;

00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:55.853
scientists are figuring out new ways
to handle their embryos,

00:10:55.877 --> 00:10:57.035
to get them to settle,

00:10:57.059 --> 00:11:01.593
maybe even figuring out the methods
to preserve them at low temperatures,

00:11:01.617 --> 00:11:04.733
so that we can preserve
their genetic diversity

00:11:04.757 --> 00:11:06.639
and work with them more often.

00:11:06.984 --> 00:11:09.857
But this is still so low-tech.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:15.275
We are limited by the space on our bench,
the number of hands in the lab

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:19.469
and the number of coffees
we can drink in any given hour.

00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:22.598
Now, compare that to our other crises

00:11:22.622 --> 00:11:25.835
and our other areas
of concern as a society.

00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:29.917
We have advanced medical technology,
we have defense technology,

00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:31.538
we have scientific technology,

00:11:31.562 --> 00:11:33.988
we even have advanced technology for art.

00:11:34.012 --> 00:11:39.409
But our technology
for conservation is behind.

00:11:41.022 --> 00:11:44.167
Think back to the most
difficult job you ever did.

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.897
Many of you would say
it was being a parent.

00:11:48.314 --> 00:11:49.971
My mother described being a parent

00:11:49.995 --> 00:11:54.206
as something that makes your life
far more amazing and far more difficult

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.760
than you could've ever possibly imagined.

00:11:56.784 --> 00:12:00.809
I've been trying to help corals
become parents for over 10 years now.

00:12:01.563 --> 00:12:03.733
And watching the wonder of life

00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:07.784
has certainly filled me with amazement
to the core of my soul.

00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:11.290
But I've also seen how difficult
it is for them to become parents.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.630
The pillar corals spawned
again two weeks ago,

00:12:14.654 --> 00:12:17.543
and we collected their eggs
and brought them back to the lab.

00:12:17.567 --> 00:12:19.625
And here you see one embryo dividing,

00:12:19.649 --> 00:12:22.523
alongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize

00:12:22.547 --> 00:12:24.207
and will blow up.

00:12:24.532 --> 00:12:27.267
They'll be infected with bacteria,
they will explode

00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:31.033
and those bacteria will threaten
the life of this one embryo

00:12:31.057 --> 00:12:33.187
that has a chance.

00:12:33.576 --> 00:12:36.539
We don't know if it was our handling
methods that went wrong

00:12:36.563 --> 00:12:38.190
and we don't know

00:12:38.214 --> 00:12:43.132
if it was just this coral on this reef,
always suffering from low fertility.

00:12:43.582 --> 00:12:44.887
Whatever the cause,

00:12:44.911 --> 00:12:49.428
we have much more work to do
before we can use baby corals

00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:54.394
to grow or fix or, yes,
maybe save coral reefs.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.521
So never mind that they're worth
hundreds of billions of dollars.

00:12:58.545 --> 00:13:03.972
Coral reefs are hardworking animals
and plants and microbes and fungi.

00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:07.616
They're providing us with art
and food and medicine.

00:13:08.012 --> 00:13:11.588
And we almost took out
an entire generation of corals.

00:13:11.975 --> 00:13:16.016
But a few made it anyway,
despite our best efforts,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.172
and now it's time for us to thank them
for the work they did

00:13:19.196 --> 00:13:24.021
and give them every chance they have
to raise the coral reefs of the future,

00:13:24.045 --> 00:13:25.533
their coral babies.

00:13:25.557 --> 00:13:26.752
Thank you so much.

00:13:26.776 --> 00:13:32.971
(Applause)
