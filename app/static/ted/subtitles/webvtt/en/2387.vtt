00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.776
Great things happen at intersections.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.016
In fact, I would argue
that some of the most interesting things

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.816
of the human experience
occur at the intersections,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.496
in the liminal space,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.576
where by liminal
I mean the space in-between.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.296
There's freedom in that in-between,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.096
freedom to create from the indefiniteness
of not-quite-here, not-quite-there,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.336
a new self-definition.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.375
Some of the great intersections
of the world come to mind,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.616
like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.096
or Times Square in New York City,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.056
both bustling with the excitement
of a seemingly endless stream of people.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.576
Other intersections,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.456
like the Edmund Pettus Bridge
in Selma, Alabama,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.176
or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court
in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.136
because of the tremendous energy
at the intersection of human beings,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.096
ideologies and the ongoing
struggle for justice.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.456
Beyond the physical
landscape of our planet,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.496
some of the most famous celestial images
are of intersections.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.896
Stars are born at the messy
intersection of gas and dust,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.416
instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.776
Stars die by this same intersection,
this time flung outward

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.176
in a violent collision of smaller atoms,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.920
intersecting and efficiently fusing
into altogether new and heavier things.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.736
We can all think of intersections
that have special meaning to us.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.576
To be intersectional, then,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.400
is to occupy a position
at an intersection.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.976
I've lived the entirety of my life
in the in-between,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.256
in the liminal space
between dreams and reality,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.576
race and gender,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.616
poverty and plenty,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.696
science and society.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.656
I am both black and a woman.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.016
Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.536
this robust combination of knowing
results in a shining example

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.056
of the explosive fusion of identities.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.176
I am also an astrophysicist.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.256
I study blazars, supermassive,
hyperactive black holes

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.936
that sit at the centers
of massive galaxies

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.816
and shoot out jets
nearby those black holes

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.576
at speeds approaching the speed of light

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.240
in a process we are still trying
to completely understand.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.696
I have dreamed
of becoming an astrophysicist

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.176
since I was 12 years old.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.576
I had no idea that at that time,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.296
according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive
of African-American women in physics,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.656
only 18 black women in the United States
had ever earned a PhD

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.656
in a physics-related discipline,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.336
and that the first black woman to graduate
with a PhD in an astronomy-related field

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.000
did so just one year before my birth.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.696
As I journeyed along my path,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.576
I encountered the best and worst
of life at an intersection:

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.416
the tremendous opportunity to self-define,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.976
the collision of expectation
and experience,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.736
the exhilaration
of victorious breakthroughs

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.456
and, sometimes,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.520
the explosive pain of regeneration.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.096
I began my college experience
just after my family had fallen apart.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.736
Our financial situation disintegrated

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.176
just after my father's
departure from our lives.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.096
This thrust my mother, my sister and I

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.096
out of the relative comfort
of middle-class life

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.496
and into the almost constant struggle
to make ends meet.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.336
Thus, I was one of roughly
60 percent of women of color

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.216
who find finances to be a major barrier
to their educational goals.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.856
Thankfully, Norfolk State University
provided me with full funding,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.816
and I was able to achieve
my bachelor's in physics.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.856
After graduation, and despite knowing
that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.056
I fell through the cracks.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.176
It was a poster that saved my dream,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.976
and some really incredible
people and programs.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.616
The American Physical Society
had this beautiful poster

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.336
encouraging students of color
to become physicists.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.856
It was striking to me
because it featured a young black girl,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.656
probably around 12 years old,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.720
looking studiously
at some physics equations.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.376
I remember thinking

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.096
I was looking directly back
at the little girl

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.936
who first dared to dream this dream.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.896
I immediately wrote to the Society

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.816
and requested my personal
copy of the poster,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.216
which to this day
still hangs in my office.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.096
I described to them in the email
my educational path,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.016
and my desire to find myself again
in pursuit of the PhD.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.776
They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt
University Bridge Program,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.576
itself an intersection
of the master's and PhD degrees

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.280
at two institutions.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.056
After two years out of school,
they accepted me into the program,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.496
and I found myself again
on the path to the PhD.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.976
After receiving my master's at Fisk,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.336
I went on to Yale to complete my PhD.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.496
Once I was physically occupying
the space that would ultimately give way

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.496
to my childhood aspirations,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.696
I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.696
(Laughter)

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.776
It became immediately apparent

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.816
that not everyone was thrilled
to have that degree of liminality

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.456
in their space.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.536
I was ostracized by many of my classmates,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.896
one of whom went so far as to invite me
to "do what I really came here to do"

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.360
as he pushed all the dirty dishes
from our meal in front of me to clean up.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.456
I wish that were an isolated occurrence,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.216
but for many women of color

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.056
in science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics, or STEM,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.656
this is something they have long endured.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.816
One hundred percent
of the 60 women of color

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.176
interviewed in a recent study
by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.576
reported facing racialized gender bias,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.320
including being mistaken
for the janitorial staff.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.176
This mistaken identity was not reported

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.736
by any of the white women
interviewed for this study,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.360
which comprised 557 women in total.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.616
While there is nothing inherently wrong
with a janitorial position,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.056
and in fact my forefathers and foremothers
were able to attend college

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.936
because many of their parents
worked these jobs,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.760
it was a clear attempt
to put me in my place.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.056
While there was certainly
the acute pain of the encounter,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.656
the real issue is that my appearance

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.216
can tell anyone anything about my ability.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.576
Beyond that, though, it underscores

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.576
that the women of color in STEM
do not experience the same set of barriers

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.696
that just women
or just people of color face.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.576
That's why today I want to highlight
women of color in STEM,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.496
who are inexorably, unapologetically

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.320
living as the inseparable
sum of identities.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.576
STEM itself is an intersectional term,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.856
such that its true richness
cannot be appreciated

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.736
without considering
the liminal space between disciplines.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.536
Science, the pursuit
of understanding the physical world

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.656
by way of chemistry, physics, biology,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.456
cannot be accomplished
in the absence of mathematics.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.536
Engineering requires the application
of basic science and math

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.576
to the lived experience.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.296
Technology sits firmly
on the foundation of math,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.656
engineering and science.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.696
Math itself serves
the critical role of Rosetta Stone,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.456
decoding and encoding
the physical principles of the world.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.416
STEM is utterly incomplete
without each individual piece.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.816
This is to say nothing
of the enrichment that is realized

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.456
when STEM is combined
with other disciplines.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.056
The purpose for this talk is twofold:

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.816
first, to say directly to every black,
Latina, indigenous, First Nation

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.856
or any other woman or girl

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.096
who finds herself resting
at the blessed intersection

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.135
of race and gender,

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.120
that you can be anything you want to be.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.655
My personal hope is
that you'll become an astrophysicist,

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.736
but beyond that, anything you want.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.816
Do not think for one minute

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.096
that because you are who you are,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.656
you cannot be
who you imagine yourself to be.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.136
Hold fast to those dreams

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.840
and let them carry you
into a world you can't even imagine.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.376
Secondly, among the most
pressing issues of our time,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.016
most now find
their intersection with STEM.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.056
We have as a global society solved

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.776
most of the single-faceted
issues of our time.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.256
Those that remain
require a thorough investigation

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.056
of the liminal space between disciplines

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.496
to create the multifaceted
solutions of tomorrow.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.616
Who better to solve these liminal problems

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.976
than those who have faced
their whole lives at the intersections.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.936
We as thought leaders and decision makers

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.376
must push past
the first steps of diversity

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.696
and into the richer
and more robust territory

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.736
of full inclusion and equal opportunity.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.816
One of my favorite examples
of liminal excellence

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.696
comes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.456
a black woman plasma physicist,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.536
who passed away this past July
after a 10-year bout with breast cancer.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.656
She was a NASA project scientist
who spearheaded the NASA side

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.136
of the Rosetta mission,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.616
which became famous this year
for landing a rover on a comet,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.136
and the 1.5 billion dollar
Galileo mission to Jupiter,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.136
two high-profile scientific victories

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.256
for NASA, the United States
and the world.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.976
Dr. Alexander said it this way:

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.696
"I'm used to walking between two cultures.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.856
For me, it's among the purposes of my life

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.496
to take us from states of ignorance
to states of understanding

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.896
with bold exploration
that you can't do every day."

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.696
This shows exactly
the power of a liminal person.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.096
She had the technical ability to spearhead

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.216
some of the most ambitious
space missions of our time,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.576
and she perfectly understood her place

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.240
of being exactly who she was
in any place she was.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.856
Jessica Matthews, inventor
of the SOCCKET line of sports products,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.856
like soccer balls, that generate
renewable energy as you play with them,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.736
said it this way:

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.216
"A major part of invention
isn't just creating things,

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.056
it's understanding people

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.320
and understanding the systems
that make this world."

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.136
The reason I tell my story

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.216
and the story of Dr. Alexander
and Jessica Matthews

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.096
is because they are fundamentally
intersectional stories,

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:28.120
the stories of lives lived at the nexus
of race, gender and innovation.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:34.376
Despite implicit and explicit questions
of my right to be in an elite space,

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.976
I'm proud to report that when I graduated,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.456
I was the first black woman
to earn a PhD in astrophysics

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.576
in Yale's then 312-year history.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.496
(Applause)

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.936
I am now part of a small but growing cadre
of women of color in STEM

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.976
who are poised to bring new perspectives
and new ideas to life

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.776
on the most pressing issues of our time:

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.976
things like educational inequities,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.976
police brutality, HIV/AIDS,
climate change, genetic editing,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.376
artificial intelligence
and Mars exploration.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.696
This is to say nothing of the things
we haven't even thought of yet.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.216
Women of color in STEM
occupy some of the toughest

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.016
and most exciting sociotechnological
issues of our time.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.376
Thus, we are uniquely positioned

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.816
to contribute to
and drive these conversations

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.976
in ways that are more inclusive
of a wider variety of lived experience.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.576
This outlook can be expanded
to the many intersectional people

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.656
whose experiences, positive and negative,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.736
enrich the conversations
in ways that outmatch

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.840
even the best-resourced homogenous groups.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.776
This is not a request
born out of a desire to fit in.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.296
It's a reminder that we cannot get
to the best possible outcomes

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.496
for the totality of humanity

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.976
without precisely this collaboration,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.536
this bringing together of the liminal,

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.056
the differently lived,
distinctly experienced

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.616
and disparately impacted.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.656
Simply put, we cannot be
the most excellent expression

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.456
of our collective genius

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.976
without the full measure
of humanity brought to bear.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.216
Thank you.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:29.120
(Applause)
