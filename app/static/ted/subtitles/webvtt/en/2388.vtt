00:00:01.157 --> 00:00:04.508
In the past few months, I've been
traveling for weeks at a time

00:00:04.532 --> 00:00:06.563
with only one suitcase of clothes.

00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:09.051
One day, I was invited
to an important event,

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.749
and I wanted to wear
something special and new for it.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.553
So I looked through my suitcase
and I couldn't find anything to wear.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.063
I was lucky to be at the technology
conference on that day,

00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:21.681
and I had access to 3D printers.

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:23.942
So I quickly designed
a skirt on my computer,

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.111
and I loaded the file on the printer.

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:28.290
It just printed the pieces overnight.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.759
The next morning,
I just took all the pieces,

00:00:30.783 --> 00:00:32.750
assembled them together in my hotel room,

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:35.730
and this is actually the skirt
that I'm wearing right now.

00:00:35.754 --> 00:00:39.654
(Applause)

00:00:39.678 --> 00:00:42.461
So it wasn't the first time
that I printed clothes.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:44.850
For my senior collection
at fashion design school,

00:00:44.874 --> 00:00:49.357
I decided to try and 3D print
an entire fashion collection from my home.

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:53.212
The problem was that I barely knew
anything about 3D printing,

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:58.011
and I had only nine months to figure out
how to print five fashionable looks.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.932
I always felt most creative
when I worked from home.

00:01:01.956 --> 00:01:04.344
I loved experimenting with new materials,

00:01:04.368 --> 00:01:06.577
and I always tried
to develop new techniques

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:10.104
to make the most unique textiles
for my fashion projects.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.105
I loved going to old factories
and weird stores

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:17.819
in search of leftovers
of strange powders and weird materials,

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:20.189
and then bring them home to experiment on.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.073
As you can probably imagine,

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:24.112
my roommates didn't like that at all.

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:25.141
(Laughter)

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:29.278
So I decided to move on
to working with big machines,

00:01:29.302 --> 00:01:31.395
ones that didn't fit in my living room.

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:33.546
I love the exact
and the custom work I can do

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.716
with all kinds of fashion technologies,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.432
like knitting machines
and laser cutting and silk printing.

00:01:40.498 --> 00:01:43.673
One summer break, I came here
to New York for an internship

00:01:43.697 --> 00:01:46.047
at a fashion house in Chinatown.

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:50.022
We worked on two incredible dresses
that were 3D printed.

00:01:50.598 --> 00:01:52.839
They were amazing --
like you can see here.

00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:55.424
But I had a few issues with them.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:59.116
They were made from hard plastics
and that's why they were very breakable.

00:01:59.897 --> 00:02:01.434
The models couldn't sit in them,

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:04.846
and they even got scratched
from the plastics under their arms.

00:02:05.444 --> 00:02:08.455
With 3D printing, the designers
had so much freedom

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.761
to make the dresses look
exactly like they wanted,

00:02:11.785 --> 00:02:17.378
but still, they were very dependent
on big and expensive industrial printers

00:02:17.402 --> 00:02:20.559
that were located in a lab
far from their studio.

00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:24.889
Later that year, a friend gave me
a 3D printed necklace,

00:02:24.913 --> 00:02:27.048
printed using a home printer.

00:02:27.072 --> 00:02:29.218
I knew that these printers
were much cheaper

00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:32.498
and much more accessible
than the ones we used at my internship.

00:02:32.984 --> 00:02:34.390
So I looked at the necklace,

00:02:34.414 --> 00:02:37.877
and then I thought, "If I can
print a necklace from home,

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:40.056
why not print my clothes from home, too?"

00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:44.145
I really liked the idea that I wouldn't
have to go to the market

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:46.793
and pick fabrics that
someone else chose to sell --

00:02:46.817 --> 00:02:50.903
I could just design them
and print them directly from home.

00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:54.051
I found a small makerspace,

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:56.698
where I learned everything
I know about 3D printing.

00:02:57.036 --> 00:02:59.631
Right away, they literally
gave me the key to the lab,

00:02:59.655 --> 00:03:02.673
so I could experiment
into the night, every night.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.158
The main challenge was to find the right
filament for printing clothes with.

00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:08.338
So what is a filament?

00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:10.794
Filament is the material
you feed the printer with.

00:03:10.818 --> 00:03:13.720
And I spent a month or so
experimenting with PLA,

00:03:13.744 --> 00:03:16.905
which is a hard and scratchy,
breakable material.

00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:20.315
The breakthrough came
when I was introduced to Filaflex,

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:21.881
which is a new kind of filament.

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.245
It's strong, yet very flexible.

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.103
And with it, I was able to print
the first garment,

00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:31.575
the red jacket that had
the word "LibertÃ©" --

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.794
"freedom" in French --

00:03:32.818 --> 00:03:34.331
embedded into it.

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:37.148
I chose this word because I felt
so empowered and free

00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:39.475
when I could just design
a garment from my home

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:41.608
and then print it by myself.

00:03:42.328 --> 00:03:45.742
And actually, you can easily
download this jacket,

00:03:45.766 --> 00:03:48.394
and easily change the word
to something else.

00:03:48.418 --> 00:03:51.066
For example, your name
or your sweetheart's name.

00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:52.657
(Laughter)

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.766
So the printer plates are small,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.868
so I had to piece the garment
together, just like a puzzle.

00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:02.489
And I wanted to solve another challenge.

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:04.058
I wanted to print textiles

00:04:04.082 --> 00:04:06.587
that I would use
just like regular fabrics.

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:08.545
That's when I found an open-source file

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.158
from an architect who designed
a pattern that I love.

00:04:11.182 --> 00:04:13.901
And with it, I was able to print
a beautiful textile

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:16.549
that I would use
just like a regular fabric.

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:19.898
And it actually even looks
a little bit like lace.

00:04:21.247 --> 00:04:24.637
So I took his file and I modified it,
and changed it, played with it --

00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:27.255
many kinds of versions out of it.

00:04:27.654 --> 00:04:31.838
And I needed to print
another 1,500 more hours

00:04:31.862 --> 00:04:34.789
to complete printing my collection.

00:04:34.813 --> 00:04:38.621
So I brought six printers to my home
and just printed 24-7.

00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:41.696
And this is actually
a really slow process,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.063
but let's remember the Internet
was significantly slower 20 years ago,

00:04:46.087 --> 00:04:48.412
so 3D printing will also accelerate

00:04:48.436 --> 00:04:51.419
and in no time you'll be able to print
a T-Shirt in your home

00:04:51.443 --> 00:04:54.408
in just a couple of hours,
or even minutes.

00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:57.146
So you guys, you want to see
what it looks like?

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.471
Audience: Yeah!

00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:00.346
(Applause)

00:05:02.293 --> 00:05:05.809
Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing
one of my five outfits.

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:10.650
Almost everything here she's wearing,
I printed from my home.

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:13.330
Even her shoes are printed.

00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:14.506
Audience: Wow!

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.695
Audience: Cool!

00:05:17.766 --> 00:05:19.521
(Applause)

00:05:19.545 --> 00:05:21.088
Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca.

00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:23.826
(To audience) Thank you, guys.

00:05:24.848 --> 00:05:27.365
So I think in the future,
materials will evolve,

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.570
and they will look and feel
like fabrics we know today,

00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:32.530
like cotton or silk.

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.316
Imagine personalized clothes
that fit exactly to your measurements.

00:05:39.537 --> 00:05:41.514
Music was once a very physical thing.

00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:44.562
You would have to go
to the record shop and buy CDs,

00:05:44.586 --> 00:05:47.236
but now you can just download the music --

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.419
digital music --

00:05:48.443 --> 00:05:49.776
directly to your phone.

00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:52.966
Fashion is also a very physical thing.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.182
And I wonder what our world will look like

00:05:56.206 --> 00:05:59.550
when our clothes will be digital,
just like this skirt is.

00:06:00.056 --> 00:06:01.429
Thank you so much.

00:06:01.453 --> 00:06:02.653
(Applause)

00:06:02.677 --> 00:06:03.827
[Thank You]

00:06:03.851 --> 00:06:06.650
(Applause)
