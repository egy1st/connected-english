WEBVTT

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.056
So when I was a kid ...

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.376
this was my team.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.576
(Laughter)

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.616
I stunk at sports.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.856
I didn't like to play them,
I didn't like to watch them.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.136
So this is what I did. I went fishing.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.656
And for all of my growing up
I fished on the shores of Connecticut,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.880
and these are the creatures
that I saw on a regular basis.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.216
But after I grew up and went to college,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.896
and I came home in the early 90's,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.616
this is what I found.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.256
My team had shrunk.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.375
It was like literally having
your roster devastated.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.416
And as I sort of looked into that,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.816
from a very personal
point of view as a fisherman,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.416
I started to kind of figure out,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.016
well, what was the rest of the world
thinking about it?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.256
First place I started to look
was fish markets.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.056
And when I went to fish markets,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.336
in spite of where I was --

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.416
whether I was in North Carolina,
or Paris, or London, or wherever --

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.616
I kept seeing this weirdly
repeating trope of four creatures,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.856
again and again --

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.456
on the menus, on ice --

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.336
shrimp, tuna, salmon and cod.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.736
And I thought this was pretty strange,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.776
and as I looked at it, I was wondering,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.416
did anyone else notice
this sort of shrinking of the market?

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.816
Well, when I looked into it,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.736
I realized that people
didn't look at it as their team.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.416
Ordinary people, the way they looked
at seafood was like this.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.896
It's not an unusual human characteristic

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.616
to reduce the natural world
down to very few elements.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.936
We did it before, 10,000 years ago,
when we came out of our caves.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.496
If you look at fire pits
from 10,000 years ago,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.096
you'll see raccoons,
you'll see, you know, wolves,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.176
you'll see all kinds
of different creatures.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.856
But if you telescope to the age of --
you know, 2,000 years ago,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.776
you'll see these four mammals:

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.216
pigs, cows, sheep and goats.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.456
It's true of birds, too.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.296
You look at the menus
in New York City restaurants

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.216
150 years ago, 200 years ago,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.976
you'll see snipe, woodcock, grouse,
dozens of ducks, dozens of geese.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.936
But telescope ahead to the age
of modern animal husbandry,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.336
and you'll see four:

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.400
turkeys, ducks, chicken and geese.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.056
So it makes sense
that we've headed in this direction.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.033
But how have we headed in this direction?

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:06.256
Well ...

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.136
first it's a very, very new problem.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.896
This is the way we've been fishing
the oceans over the last 50 years.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.136
World War II was a tremendous incentive
to arm ourselves in a war against fish.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.416
All of the technology
that we perfected during World War II --

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.096
sonar, lightweight polymers --

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.416
all these things
were redirected towards fish.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.856
And so you see this tremendous buildup
in fishing capacity,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.536
quadrupling in the course of time,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.456
from the end of World War II
to the present time.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.856
And right now that means

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.536
we're taking between 80 and 90 million
metric tons out of the sea every year.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.776
That's the equivalent
of the human weight of China

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.336
taken out of the sea every year.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.976
And it's no coincidence
that I use China as the example

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.016
because China is now
the largest fishing nation in the world.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.656
Well, that's only half the story.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.056
The other half of the story

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.136
is this incredible boom
in fish farming and aquaculture,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.376
which is now, only
in the last year or two,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.776
starting to exceed the amount
of wild fish that we produce.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.816
So that if you add wild fish
and farmed fish together,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.296
you get the equivalent
of two Chinas created from the ocean

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.576
each and every year.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.736
And again, it's not a coincidence
that I use China as the example,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.816
because China, in addition
to being the biggest catcher of fish,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.920
is also the biggest farmer of fish.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.376
So let's look though at the four choices
we are making right now.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.616
The first one --

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.336
by far the most consumed seafood
in America and in much of the West,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.576
is shrimp.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.056
Shrimp in the wild --
as a wild product --

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.416
is a terrible product.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.896
5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fish
are regularly killed

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.336
to bring one pound of shrimp
to the market.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.456
They're also incredibly fuel inefficient
to bring to the market.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.576
In a recent study that was produced
out of Dalhousie University,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.416
it was found that dragging for shrimp

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.280
is one of the most carbon-intensive
ways of fishing that you can find.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.296
So you can farm them,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.576
and people do farm them,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.616
and they farm them a lot
in this very area.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.856
Problem is ...

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.096
the place where you farm shrimp
is in these wild habitats --

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.336
in mangrove forests.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.416
Now look at those lovely
roots coming down.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.536
Those are the things
that hold soil together,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.336
protect coasts, create habitats
for all sorts of young fish, young shrimp,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.137
all sorts of things
that are important to this environment.

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:17.161
Well, this is what happens
to a lot of coastal mangrove forests.

00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:19.495
We've lost millions of acres
of coastal mangroves

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.935
over the last 30 or 40 years.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.416
That rate of destruction has slowed,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.040
but we're still
in a major mangrove deficit.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.496
The other thing that's going on here

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.080
is a phenomenon that the filmmaker
Mark Benjamin called "Grinding Nemo."

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.176
This phenomenon is very, very relevant

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.696
to anything that you've ever seen
on a tropical reef.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.376
Because what's going on right now,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.576
we have shrimp draggers
dragging for shrimp,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.456
catching a huge amount of bycatch,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.576
that bycatch in turn gets ground up
and turned into shrimp food.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.736
And sometimes, many of these vessels --

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.136
manned by slaves --

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.856
are catching these so-called "trash fish,"

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.833
fish that we would love to see on a reef,

00:04:55.857 --> 00:04:57.056
grinding them up

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.830
and turning them into shrimp feed --

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:02.334
an ecosystem literally eating itself
and spitting out shrimp.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.296
The next most consumed seafood in America,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.016
and also throughout the West,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.256
is tuna.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.336
So tuna is this ultimate global fish.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.376
These huge management areas
have to be observed

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.336
in order for tuna to be well managed.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.136
Our own management area,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.616
called a Regional Fisheries
Management Organization,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.856
is called ICCAT,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.096
the International Commission
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.816
The great naturalist
Carl Safina once called it,

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.096
"The International Conspiracy
to Catch all the Tunas."

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.176
Of course we've seen
incredible improvement

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.696
in ICCAT in the last few years,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.456
there is total room for improvement,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.376
but it remains to be said
that tuna is a global fish,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.216
and to manage it,
we have to manage the globe.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.176
Well, we could also try to grow tuna

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.360
but tuna is a spectacularly bad
animal for aquaculture.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.936
Many people don't know this
but tuna are warm-blooded.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.376
They can heat their bodies 20 degrees
above ambient temperature,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.496
they can swim at over 40 miles an hour.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.256
So that pretty much eliminates

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.376
all the advantages
of farming a fish, right?

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.616
A farmed fish is --

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.069
or a fish is cold-blooded,
it doesn't move too much.

00:06:04.093 --> 00:06:06.096
That's a great thing for growing protein.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.456
But if you've got
this crazy, wild creature

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.976
that swims at 40 miles an hour
and heats its blood --

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.320
not a great candidate for aquaculture.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.976
The next creature --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.976
most consumed seafood in America
and throughout the West --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.216
is salmon.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.416
Now salmon got its plundering, too,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.576
but it didn't really necessarily
happen through fishing.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.376
This is my home state of Connecticut.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.456
Connecticut used to be home
to a lot of wild salmon.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.536
But if you look
at this map of Connecticut,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.560
every dot on that map is a dam.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.256
There are over 3,000 dams
in the state of Connecticut.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.816
I often say this is why people
in Connecticut are so uptight --

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.416
(Laughter)

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.976
If somebody could just
unblock Connecticut's chi,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.496
I feel that we could have
an infinitely better world.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.256
But I made this particular comment

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.936
at a convention once
of national parks officers,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.696
and this guy from North Carolina
sidled up to me, he says,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.016
"You know, you oughtn't be so hard
on your Connecticut,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.856
cause we here in North Carolina,
we got 35,000 dams."

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.736
So it's a national epidemic,
it's an international epidemic.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.216
And there are dams everywhere,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.896
and these are precisely the things

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.696
that stop wild salmon
from reaching their spawning grounds.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.816
So as a result,
we've turned to aquaculture,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.496
and salmon is one the most successful,
at least from a numbers point of view.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.736
When they first started farming salmon,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.696
it could take as many
as six pounds of wild fish

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.896
to make a single pound of salmon.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.576
The industry has, to its credit,
greatly improved.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.267
They've gotten it below two to one,

00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:34.576
although it's a little bit of a cheat

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.416
because if you look at the way
aquaculture feed is produced,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.896
they're measuring pellets --

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.176
pounds of pellets per pound of salmon.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.856
Those pellets are in turn reduced fish.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.376
So the actual -- what's called the FIFO,
the fish in and the fish out --

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.736
kind of hard to say.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.976
But in any case,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.216
credit to the industry,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.816
it has lowered the amount of fish
per pound of salmon.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.016
Problem is we've also gone crazy

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.256
with the amount of salmon
that we're producing.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.896
Aquaculture is the fastest growing
food system on the planet.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.896
It's growing at something
like seven percent per year.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.936
And so even though
we're doing less per fish

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.256
to bring it to the market,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.016
we're still killing
a lot of these little fish.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.216
And it's not just fish
that we're feeding fish to,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.840
we're also feeding fish
to chickens and pigs.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.536
So we've got chickens
and they're eating fish,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.816
but weirdly, we also have fish
that are eating chickens.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.936
Because the byproducts of chickens --
feathers, blood, bone --

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.256
get ground up and fed to fish.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.496
So I often wonder,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.760
is there a fish that ate
a chicken that ate a fish?

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.376
It's sort of a reworking
of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway --

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.496
(Laughter)

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.296
All together, though,
it results in a terrible mess.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.696
What you're talking about

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:51.376
is something between 20 and 30 million
metric tons of wild creatures

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.376
that are taken from the ocean
and used and ground up.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.456
That's the equivalent
of a third of a China,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.536
or of an entire United States of humans

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.960
that's taken out of the sea
each and every year.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.696
The last of the four
is a kind of amorphous thing.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.216
It's what the industry calls "whitefish."

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.216
There are many fish that get cycled
into this whitefish thing

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.456
but the way to kind of tell
the story, I think,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.416
is through that classic piece
of American culinary innovation,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.816
the Filet-O-Fish sandwich.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.816
So the Filet-O-Fish sandwich
actually started as halibut.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.176
And it started because
a local franchise owner

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.736
found that when he served
his McDonald's on Friday, nobody came.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.296
Because it was a Catholic
community, they needed fish.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.176
So he went to Ray Kroc and he said,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.696
"I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich,
going to be made out of halibut."

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.016
Ray Kroc said, "I don't think
it's going to work.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.336
I want to do a Hula Burger,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.884
and there's going to be
a slice of pineapple on a bun.

00:09:42.908 --> 00:09:44.644
But let's do this, let's have a bet.

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:48.176
Whosever sandwich sells more,
that will be the winning sandwich."

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.536
Well, it's kind of sad for the ocean
that the Hula Burger didn't win.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.696
So he made his halibut sandwich.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.056
Unfortunately though,
the sandwich came in at 30 cents.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.616
Ray wanted the sandwich
to come in at 25 cents,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.576
so he turned to Atlantic cod.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.376
We all know what happened to
Atlantic cod in New England.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.896
So now the Filet-O-Fish sandwich
is made out of Alaska pollock,

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.656
it's the largest fin fish fishery
in the United States,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.056
2 to 3 billion pounds of fish
taken out of the sea every single year.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.616
If we go through the pollock,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.096
the next choice is probably
going to be tilapia.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.096
Tilapia is one of those fish
nobody ever heard of 20 years ago.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.376
It's actually a very efficient converter
of plant protein into animal protein,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.456
and it's been a godsend
to the third world.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.856
It's actually a tremendously
sustainable solution,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.096
it goes from an egg
to an adult in nine months.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.456
The problem is that when you
look about the West,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.496
it doesn't do what the West
wants it to do.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.256
It really doesn't have what's called
an oily fish profile.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.656
It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.976
that we all think are going
to make us live forever.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.496
So what do we do?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.696
I mean, first of all,
what about this poor fish, the clupeids?

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.160
The fish that represent a huge part
of that 20 to 30 million metric tons.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.816
Well, one possibility
that a lot of conservationists have raised

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.456
is could we eat them?

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.376
Could we eat them directly
instead of feeding them to salmon?

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.736
There are arguments for it.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.380
They are tremendously fuel efficient
to bring to market,

00:11:08.404 --> 00:11:10.496
a fraction of the fuel cost
of say, shrimp,

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.856
and at the very top
of the carbon efficiency scale.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.016
They also are omega-3 rich,
a great source for EPA and DHA.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.496
So that is a potential.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.216
And if we were to go down that route
what I would say is,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.056
instead of paying a few bucks a pound --
or a few bucks a ton, really --

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.056
and making it into aquafeed,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.376
could we halve the catch
and double the price for the fishermen

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.520
and make that our way
of treating these particular fish?

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.896
Other possibility though,
which is much more interesting,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.296
is looking at bivalves,
particularly mussels.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.256
Now, mussels are very high in EPA and DHA,
they're similar to canned tuna.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.216
They're also extremely fuel efficient.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.056
To bring a pound of mussels to market

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.696
is about a thirtieth of the carbon
as required to bring beef to market.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.296
They require no forage fish,

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.576
they actually get their omega-3s
by filtering the water of microalgae.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.816
In fact, that's where omega-3s come from,
they don't come from fish.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.896
Microalgae make the omega-3s,
they're only bioconcentrated in fish.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.176
Mussels and other bivalves

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.200
do tremendous amounts of water filtration.

00:12:11.224 --> 00:12:14.776
A single mussel can filter
dozens of gallons every single day.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.576
And this is incredibly important
when we look at the world.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.176
Right now, nitrification,
overuse of phosphates in our waterways

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.536
are causing tremendous algal blooms.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.816
Over 400 new dead zones
have been created in the last 20 years,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.440
tremendous sources of marine life death.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.496
We also could look at not a fish at all.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.936
We could look at a vegetable.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.696
We could look at seaweed, the kelps,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.056
all these different varieties of things
that can be high in omega-3s,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.376
can be high in proteins,

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.016
tremendously good things.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.696
They filter the water
just like mussels do.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.976
And weirdly enough,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.616
it turns out that you
can actually feed this to cows.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.856
Now, I'm not a big fan of cattle.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.816
But if you wanted to keep growing cattle

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.656
in a time and place
where water resources are limited,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.776
you're growing seaweed in the water,
you don't have to water it --

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.456
major consideration.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.216
And the last fish is a question mark.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.096
We have the ability
to create aquacultured fish

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.536
that creates a net gain
of marine protein for us.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.696
This creature would have to be vegetarian,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.496
it would have to be fast growing,

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.176
it would have to be adaptable
to a changing climate

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.536
and it would have to have
that oily fish profile,

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.456
that EPA, DHA, omega-3
fatty acid profile that we're looking for.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.416
This exists kind of on paper.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.056
I have been reporting
on these subjects for 15 years.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.976
Every time I do a new story,
somebody tells me,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.856
"We can do all that. We can do it.
We've figured it all out.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.096
We can produce a fish

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.696
that's a net gain of marine protein
and has omega-3s."

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.936
Great.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.096
It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.856
It is time to scale this up.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.096
If we do,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.616
30 million metric tons of seafood,
a third of the world catch,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.840
stays in the water.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.176
So I guess what I'm saying is
this is what we've been going with.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.376
We tend to go with our appetites
rather than our minds.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.896
But if we went with this,
or some configuration of it,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.635
we might have a little more of this.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.336
Thank you.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.840
(Applause)
