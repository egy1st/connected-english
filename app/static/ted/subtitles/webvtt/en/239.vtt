00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
through a desolate countryside.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
With it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
by being the first to conquer outer space.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The rocket was huge.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And packed in its nose was a silver ball

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with two radios inside.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
On October 4, 1957, they launched their rocket.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time:

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
"We are about to create a new planet

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that we will call Sputnik.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In the olden days, explorers

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
like Vasco da Gama and Columbus

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now we have the good fortune to open up space.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy."

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You're watching snippets from "Sputnik," my fifth documentary feature,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which is just about completed.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It tells the story of Sputnik,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and the story of what happened to America as a result.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
For days after the launch,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it inspired awe and pride

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that humans had finally launched an object into space.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the media and the politicians told us,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and we believed, that Sputnik was proof

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that our enemy had beaten us

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in science and technology,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
All hell broke loose.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America --

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It provoked the missile gap.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It exploded an arms race.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It began the space race.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to 20,000.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
For example, some here will remember

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
this day, June 1958,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the National Civil Defense Drill,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
believed that a nuclear war would happen,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and that at least 50 percent of our population

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
was going to be killed.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
For example, some in this room went to school on scholarship

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
because of Sputnik.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Support for engineering, math and science --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
education in general -- boomed.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
led directly to ARPA, and the Internet,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and, of course, NASA.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
My feature documentary shows how a free society

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
can be stampeded by those who know how to use media.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But it also shows how we can turn

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
what appears at first to be a bad situation,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
into something that was overall very good for America.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
"Sputnik" will soon be released.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
In closing, I would like to take a moment to thank

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
one of my investors:

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
longtime TEDster, Jay Walker.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And I'd like to thank you all.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
(Applause).

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Thank you, Chris.
