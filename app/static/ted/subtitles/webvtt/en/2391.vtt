WEBVTT

00:00:01.713 --> 00:00:03.079
Can I get a show of hands --

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:06.805
how many of you in this room
have been on a plane in this past year?

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:09.411
That's pretty good.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:12.320
Well, it turns out that you
share that experience

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:15.179
with more than three billion
people every year.

00:00:15.203 --> 00:00:18.340
And when we put so many people
in all these metal tubes

00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:19.950
that fly all over the world,

00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:22.647
sometimes, things like this can happen

00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:24.558
and you get a disease epidemic.

00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:27.067
I first actually got into this topic

00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:29.723
when I heard about the Ebola
outbreak last year.

00:00:29.747 --> 00:00:31.207
And it turns out that,

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.061
although Ebola spreads
through these more range-limited,

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:35.419
large-droplet routes,

00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:37.421
there's all these other sorts of diseases

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:39.421
that can be spread in the airplane cabin.

00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:42.629
The worst part is, when we take
a look at some of the numbers,

00:00:42.653 --> 00:00:44.066
it's pretty scary.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.850
So with H1N1,

00:00:45.874 --> 00:00:48.263
there was this guy that decided
to go on the plane

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:50.058
and in the matter of a single flight

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.336
actually spread the disease
to 17 other people.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.488
And then there was this
other guy with SARS,

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:56.614
who managed to go on a three-hour flight

00:00:56.638 --> 00:00:59.480
and spread the disease to 22 other people.

00:00:59.504 --> 00:01:02.912
That's not exactly my idea
of a great superpower.

00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:06.222
When we take a look at this,
what we also find

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:09.222
is that it's very difficult
to pre-screen for these diseases.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.710
So when someone actually
goes on a plane,

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:12.940
they could be sick

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:15.359
and they could actually
be in this latency period

00:01:15.383 --> 00:01:17.542
in which they could actually
have the disease

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.138
but not exhibit any symptoms,

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:21.353
and they could, in turn,
spread the disease

00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:23.050
to many other people in the cabin.

00:01:23.074 --> 00:01:25.156
How that actually works is that right now

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.466
we've got air coming in
from the top of the cabin

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.916
and from the side of the cabin,
as you see in blue.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.142
And then also, that air goes out
through these very efficient filters

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:38.714
that eliminate 99.97 percent
of pathogens near the outlets.

00:01:39.444 --> 00:01:40.921
What happens right now, though,

00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:43.012
is that we have this
mixing airflow pattern.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:44.868
So if someone were to actually sneeze,

00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:47.596
that air would get swirled
around multiple times

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.865
before it even has a chance
to go out through the filter.

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:54.998
So I thought: clearly, this
is a pretty serious problem.

00:01:55.022 --> 00:01:58.755
I didn't have the money
to go out and buy a plane,

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:01.017
so I decided to build a computer instead.

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:04.313
It actually turns out that
with computational fluid dynamics,

00:02:04.337 --> 00:02:06.938
what we're able to do
is create these simulations

00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:08.756
that give us higher resolutions

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.400
than actually physically going
in and taking readings in the plane.

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:15.850
And so how, essentially, this works
is you would start out

00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:17.546
with these 2D drawings --

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.698
these are floating around
in technical papers around the Internet.

00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:23.615
I take that and then I put it
into this 3D-modeling software,

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.418
really building that 3D model.

00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:29.901
And then I divide that model
that I just built into these tiny pieces,

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:33.502
essentially meshing it so that
the computer can better understand it.

00:02:33.526 --> 00:02:37.247
And then I tell the computer where
the air goes in and out of the cabin,

00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:38.770
throw in a bunch of physics

00:02:38.794 --> 00:02:43.015
and basically sit there and wait until
the computer calculates the simulation.

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:47.642
So what we get, actually,
with the conventional cabin is this:

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.913
you'll notice the middle person sneezing,

00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:54.159
and we go "Splat!" -- it goes
right into people's faces.

00:02:54.882 --> 00:02:56.703
It's pretty disgusting.

00:02:56.727 --> 00:02:59.075
From the front, you'll notice
those two passengers

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.885
sitting next to the central passenger

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.615
not exactly having a great time.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.825
And when we take a look
at that from the side,

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.842
you'll also notice those pathogens
spreading across the length of the cabin.

00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:12.367
The first thing I thought was,
"This is no good."

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:15.899
So I actually conducted
more than 32 different simulations

00:03:15.923 --> 00:03:19.288
and ultimately, I came up
with this solution right here.

00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:22.828
This is what I call a -- patent pending --
Global Inlet Director.

00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:25.418
With this, we're able to reduce
pathogen transmission

00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:27.210
by about 55 times,

00:03:27.234 --> 00:03:30.387
and increase fresh-air inhalation
by about 190 percent.

00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:32.015
So how this actually works

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:35.168
is we would install this piece
of composite material

00:03:35.192 --> 00:03:38.160
into these existing spots
that are already in the plane.

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:40.185
So it's very cost-effective to install

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.057
and we can do this directly overnight.

00:03:42.081 --> 00:03:45.629
All we have to do is put a couple
of screws in there and you're good to go.

00:03:45.653 --> 00:03:48.512
And the results that we get
are absolutely amazing.

00:03:48.536 --> 00:03:52.072
Instead of having those problematic
swirling airflow patterns,

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:53.838
we can create these walls of air

00:03:53.862 --> 00:03:56.032
that come down in-between the passengers

00:03:56.056 --> 00:03:57.954
to create personalized breathing zones.

00:03:57.978 --> 00:04:00.963
So you'll notice the middle passenger
here is sneezing again,

00:04:00.987 --> 00:04:03.700
but this time, we're able
to effectively push that down

00:04:03.724 --> 00:04:06.437
to the filters for elimination.

00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:07.857
And same thing from the side,

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:11.110
you'll notice we're able to directly
push those pathogens down.

00:04:11.682 --> 00:04:15.176
So if you take a look again now
at the same scenario

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.889
but with this innovation installed,

00:04:16.913 --> 00:04:18.929
you'll notice the middle
passenger sneezes,

00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:22.026
and this time, we're pushing
that straight down into the outlet

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.771
before it gets a chance
to infect any other people.

00:04:25.795 --> 00:04:28.919
So you'll notice the two passengers
sitting next to the middle guy

00:04:28.943 --> 00:04:31.176
are breathing virtually
no pathogens at all.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.728
Take a look at that from the side as well,

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:35.307
you see a very efficient system.

00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:37.953
And in short, with this system, we win.

00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:42.144
When we take a look at what this means,

00:04:42.168 --> 00:04:45.640
what we see is that this not only works
if the middle passenger sneezes,

00:04:45.664 --> 00:04:48.438
but also if the window-seat
passenger sneezes

00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:50.557
or if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes.

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:54.254
And so with this solution, what does
this mean for the world?

00:04:54.278 --> 00:04:57.792
Well, when we take a look at this

00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:00.385
from the computer simulation
into real life,

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.171
we can see with this 3D model
that I built over here,

00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:05.283
essentially using 3D printing,

00:05:05.307 --> 00:05:08.266
we can see those same
airflow patterns coming down,

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.876
right to the passengers.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.990
In the past, the SARS epidemic
actually cost the world

00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:15.943
about 40 billion dollars.

00:05:15.967 --> 00:05:17.126
And in the future,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.696
a big disease outbreak
could actually cost the world

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.578
in excess of three trillion dollars.

00:05:21.942 --> 00:05:25.419
So before, it used to be that you had
to take an airplane out of service

00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:27.315
for one to two months,

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.911
spend tens of thousands of man hours
and several million dollars

00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:32.258
to try to change something.

00:05:32.282 --> 00:05:35.793
But now, we're able to install
something essentially overnight

00:05:35.817 --> 00:05:37.544
and see results right away.

00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:40.774
So it's really now a matter of taking
this through to certification,

00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:41.988
flight testing,

00:05:42.012 --> 00:05:45.004
and going through all of these
regulatory approvals processes.

00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:48.092
But it just really goes to show
that sometimes the best solutions

00:05:48.116 --> 00:05:49.554
are the simplest solutions.

00:05:49.935 --> 00:05:53.125
And two years ago, even,

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:54.918
this project would not have happened,

00:05:54.942 --> 00:05:57.768
just because the technology then
wouldn't have supported it.

00:05:57.792 --> 00:06:00.261
But now with advanced computing

00:06:00.285 --> 00:06:02.471
and how developed our Internet is,

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:05.134
it's really the golden era for innovation.

00:06:05.158 --> 00:06:08.401
And so the question I ask all
of you today is: why wait?

00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:10.746
Together, we can build the future today.

00:06:11.123 --> 00:06:12.274
Thanks.

00:06:12.298 --> 00:06:15.404
(Applause)
