Nicole Paris: TEDYouth, make some noise!

00:00:02.738 --> 00:00:04.619
(Beatboxing)

00:00:04.643 --> 00:00:06.144
TEDYouth, make some --

00:00:06.168 --> 00:00:07.918
(Beatboxing)

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:30.216
(Beatboxing ends)

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.353
Are you ready?

00:00:32.377 --> 00:00:33.631
(Cheers and applause)

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:34.820
Are you ready?

00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:37.356
Ed Cage: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.074
(Beatboxing)

00:00:43.357 --> 00:00:45.572
(Laughter)

00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:48.414
EC: Y'all like that? Let me show you
how we used to do it --

00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:49.691
NP: Get it pops, go ahead.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.730
EC: ... when I was growing up in the '90s.

00:00:52.107 --> 00:00:53.869
(Beatboxing)

00:00:57.815 --> 00:00:59.815
(Beatboxing ends)

00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:02.408
(Laughter)

00:01:02.432 --> 00:01:07.471
(Beatboxing)

00:01:15.912 --> 00:01:17.825
NP: Pops, pops, pops, pops, pops, pops,

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:19.842
hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up!

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.127
Oh my God.

00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:23.692
OK, he's trying to battle me.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.858
Hold on, right now, hold on.

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:29.871
Do you remember when you used
to beatbox me to sleep?

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:31.324
EC: Yeah, yeah, I remember.

00:01:31.348 --> 00:01:33.901
That's when she was a little baby.

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:35.467
We would do something like this.

00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:38.490
(Beatboxing)

00:01:44.273 --> 00:01:45.720
NP: I remember that.

00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:47.697
(Beatboxing)

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:58.761
NP: All right, pops, pops, pops,
chill out, chill out.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.273
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

00:02:00.297 --> 00:02:01.686
EC: Y'all remember the video.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.890
This is like a little payback or something

00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:06.413
for 50 million people
calling me the loser.

00:02:06.437 --> 00:02:07.795
NP: Hold up, hold up.

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.978
But a lot of people out there don't
really know what beatboxing is,

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:12.525
where it started from.

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:13.700
EC: Right, right.

00:02:13.724 --> 00:02:14.917
NP: Where it came from.

00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:17.298
So why don't you give
them a little history --

00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:20.013
just a tickle -- a bit of history
of where it comes from.

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:21.894
EC: Beatbox started here in New York.

00:02:21.918 --> 00:02:23.069
(Cheers)

00:02:23.093 --> 00:02:26.580
That's right, that's right.
New York, New York!

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.231
Everybody like, "Yeah!"

00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:29.745
Well, we from St. Louis.

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:30.787
(Laughter)

00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:32.931
NP: Now you can put y'all hands down.

00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:34.254
(Laughter)

00:02:34.278 --> 00:02:36.255
EC: But beatbox started here in New York.

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.970
What you would have is that,
when we would go to parties,

00:02:38.994 --> 00:02:41.470
you would have the DJ
and you would have the rapper.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.237
But because I don't have
electricity coming out of me,

00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:47.386
we had to emulate
what the beats was doing.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.003
So when you would see the beatboxer,

00:02:50.027 --> 00:02:51.963
you would see us over to the side.

00:02:51.987 --> 00:02:54.913
Then you would see a rapper,
and when the rapper began to rap,

00:02:54.937 --> 00:02:56.191
we would do a simple beat,

00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:58.237
because back then the beats were simple --

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:03.122
(Beatboxing)

00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:04.297
or --

00:03:04.321 --> 00:03:10.017
(Beatboxing)

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:11.868
Those were simple beats.

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:16.294
But now, you got folks that want
to do all type of stuff

00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:17.535
with their beats now,

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:19.948
and they want to humiliate their father,

00:03:19.972 --> 00:03:23.222
which is not right when you want
to humiliate the person

00:03:23.246 --> 00:03:26.112
that take care of you, pay
all your tuition, (Nicole laughs)

00:03:26.136 --> 00:03:28.523
especially when you have 50 million people

00:03:28.547 --> 00:03:30.664
that just go around
and call you "the loser."

00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:32.593
Well, I'm taking that to heart.

00:03:32.617 --> 00:03:34.825
But now we do something
different in our house,

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.750
so we have these jam sessions,

00:03:36.774 --> 00:03:41.008
and our jam sessions consist
of us jamming in church.

00:03:41.032 --> 00:03:43.465
You know, in church,
we'll look at each other like,

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.640
(Beatboxing)

00:03:44.664 --> 00:03:45.665
(Laughter)

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.527
and we'll text the beat to each other.

00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:50.387
Or we'll be in the kitchen cooking,

00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:52.214
road trips, airports.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.964
NP: Standing right there in the corner,
"Aw, Dad -- listen to that."

00:03:55.988 --> 00:03:57.176
(Beatboxing)

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.185
Naw, I'm kidding. But you know what?

00:03:59.852 --> 00:04:03.055
We're talking all about this
jam session and everything.

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.229
EC: Yeah.

00:04:04.253 --> 00:04:08.750
NP: Why don't we give them a little peek,
just a tiny bit of our jam session?

00:04:08.774 --> 00:04:12.316
NP: Y'all want to hear some jam session?
EC: Y'all ready for a jam session?

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.341
(Cheers)

00:04:13.365 --> 00:04:14.710
NP: Sorry? I can't hear you.

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:15.735
(Cheers)

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:16.910
Yeah! Kick it, pops!

00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:19.576
(Beatboxing)

00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:21.826
(Applause)

00:05:21.864 --> 00:05:23.887
(Beatboxing)

00:05:50.265 --> 00:05:52.265
(Beatboxing ends)

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:57.239
(Applause)

00:05:57.263 --> 00:05:58.621
NP: I'm getting ready to go!

00:05:58.645 --> 00:06:01.752
EC: Y'all ready? Everybody stand up!
Come on, everybody stand up!

00:06:01.776 --> 00:06:04.470
Get on up! Come on, stretch!

00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:07.761
(Beatboxing)

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.610
(Beatboxing ends)

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.893
NP: That's it.

00:06:37.917 --> 00:06:41.039
(Cheers and applause)

00:06:41.063 --> 00:06:42.366
Thank you! Make some noise!

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.588
EG: Thank you, everybody!

00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:45.492
NP: Make some noise! Make some noise!

00:06:45.516 --> 00:06:46.667
Thank you!
