00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.261
So, I have an overlooked
but potentially lucrative

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:07.264
investment opportunity for you.

00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:10.861
Over the past 10 years in the UK,

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:14.320
the return on burial plots
has outperformed the UK property market

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:16.647
by a ratio of around three to one.

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:21.746
There are private cemeteries being set up
with plots for sale to investors,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.914
and they start at around 3,900 pounds.

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:28.460
And they're projected to achieve
about 40 percent growth.

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:33.552
The biggest advantage is that this
is a market with continuous demand.

00:00:35.996 --> 00:00:38.061
Now, this is a real proposition,

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:42.531
and there are companies out there
that really are offering this investment,

00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:45.317
but my interest in it is quite different.

00:00:45.713 --> 00:00:47.755
I'm an architect and urban designer,

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:49.370
and for the past year and a half,

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:52.394
I've been looking at approaches
to death and dying

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:55.729
and at how they've shaped our cities
and the buildings within them.

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:59.675
So in the summer,
I did my first exhibition

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.215
on death and architecture in Venice,

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.119
and it was called "Death in Venice."

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.564
And because death is a subject

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:09.645
that many of us find quite
uncomfortable to talk about,

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.994
the exhibition was designed
to be quite playful,

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:14.517
so that people would
literally engage with it.

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:18.427
So one of our exhibits
was an interactive map of London

00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.469
which showed just how much
of the real estate in the city

00:01:21.493 --> 00:01:23.443
is given over to death.

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:25.649
As you wave your hand across the map,

00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:29.178
the name of the piece of real estate --
the building or the cemetery --

00:01:29.202 --> 00:01:30.352
is revealed.

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.473
And those white shapes that you can see,

00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:36.406
they're all of the hospitals and hospices

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.161
and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city.

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:41.247
In fact, the majority are cemeteries.

00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:46.354
We wanted to show that, even though
death and burial are things

00:01:46.378 --> 00:01:47.869
that we might not think about,

00:01:47.893 --> 00:01:51.423
they're all around us, and they're
important parts of our cities.

00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:56.495
So about half a million people
die in the UK each year,

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:59.548
and of those, around a quarter
will want to be buried.

00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:03.512
But the UK, like many
Western European countries,

00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:05.211
is running out of burial space,

00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:07.115
especially in the major cities.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.186
And the Greater London Authority
has been aware of this for a while,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.678
and the main causes are population growth,

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:17.543
the fact that existing
cemeteries are almost full.

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:21.874
There's a custom in the UK that graves
are considered to be occupied forever,

00:02:21.898 --> 00:02:25.625
and there's also development pressure --
people want to use that same land

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:29.208
to build houses or offices or shops.

00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:31.697
So they came up with a few solutions.

00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:35.764
They were like, well, maybe we can
reuse those graves after 50 years.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:38.101
Or maybe we can bury people,
like, four deep,

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:41.113
so that four people can be buried
in the same plot,

00:02:41.137 --> 00:02:43.780
and we can make more efficient use
of the land that way,

00:02:43.804 --> 00:02:47.144
and in that way, hopefully London
will still have space to bury people

00:02:47.168 --> 00:02:48.319
in the near future.

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:51.768
But, traditionally, cemeteries
haven't been taken care of

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:53.532
by the local authority.

00:02:53.556 --> 00:02:56.922
In fact, the surprising thing is that
there's no legal obligation

00:02:56.946 --> 00:02:59.975
on anyone in the UK
to provide burial space.

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:05.282
Traditionally, it's been done
by private and religious organizations,

00:03:05.306 --> 00:03:08.117
like churches and mosques and synagogues.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.435
But there's also occasionally
been a for-profit group

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.476
who has wanted to get in on the act.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.005
And, you know, they look at
the small size of a burial plot

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.697
and that high cost,

00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:22.213
and it looks like there's
serious money to be made.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.294
So, actually, if you want to go out
and start your own cemetery,

00:03:26.318 --> 00:03:27.741
you kind of can.

00:03:27.765 --> 00:03:29.901
There was this couple in South Wales,

00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:33.161
and they had a farmhouse
and a load of fields next to it,

00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:35.316
and they wanted to develop the land.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.741
They had a load of ideas.

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:39.879
They first thought about making
a caravan park,

00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:41.617
but the council said no.

00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:43.609
And then they wanted to make a fish farm

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:45.354
and again the council said no.

00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:48.422
Then they hit on the idea
of making a cemetery

00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:50.502
and they calculated that by doing this,

00:03:50.526 --> 00:03:53.043
they could increase
the value of their land

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:57.796
from about 95,000 pounds
to over one million pounds.

00:03:58.802 --> 00:04:03.561
But just to come back to this idea
of making profit from cemeteries,

00:04:03.585 --> 00:04:05.655
like, it's kind of ludicrous, right?

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:09.780
The thing is that the high cost
of those burial plots

00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:11.920
is actually very misleading.

00:04:11.944 --> 00:04:13.731
They look like they're expensive,

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:17.957
but that cost reflects the fact that
you need to maintain the burial plot --

00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:21.289
like, someone has to cut the grass
for the next 50 years.

00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:24.210
That means it's very difficult
to make money from cemeteries.

00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:27.059
And it's the reason that normally
they're run by the council

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:29.079
or by a not-for-profit group.

00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:31.754
But anyway, the council granted
these people permission,

00:04:31.778 --> 00:04:34.229
and they're now trying
to build their cemetery.

00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:37.573
So just to explain to you
kind of how this works:

00:04:37.597 --> 00:04:39.654
If I want to build something in the UK,

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:41.870
like a cemetery for example,

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:44.868
then I have to apply
for planning permission first.

00:04:44.892 --> 00:04:49.102
So if I want to build a new
office building for a client

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:51.380
or if I want to extend my home

00:04:51.404 --> 00:04:55.173
or, you know, if I have a shop
and I want to convert it into an office,

00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:56.728
I have to do a load of drawings,

00:04:56.752 --> 00:04:59.188
and I submit them
to the council for permission.

00:04:59.212 --> 00:05:03.169
And they'll look at things like
how it fits in the surroundings.

00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:05.225
So they'll look at what it looks like.

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.845
But they'll also think about things
like what impact is it going to have

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:10.344
on the local environment?

00:05:10.368 --> 00:05:12.408
And they'll be thinking about things like,

00:05:12.432 --> 00:05:14.273
is this thing going to cause pollution

00:05:14.297 --> 00:05:16.225
or is there going to be a lot of traffic

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.582
that wants to go to this thing
that I've built?

00:05:18.606 --> 00:05:19.986
But also good things.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.327
Is it going to add local services
like shops to the neighborhood

00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:25.413
that local people would like to use?

00:05:26.183 --> 00:05:28.877
And they'll weigh up the advantages
and the disadvantages

00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:30.337
and they'll make a decision.

00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:34.880
So that's how it works if I want
to build a large cemetery.

00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:37.350
But what if I've got a piece of land

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:40.692
and I just want to bury
a few people, like five or six?

00:05:41.533 --> 00:05:45.152
Well, then -- actually, I don't need
permission from anyone!

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.216
There's actually almost no regulation
in the UK around burial,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.883
and the little bit that there is,
is about not polluting water courses,

00:05:53.907 --> 00:05:56.517
like not polluting rivers or groundwater.

00:05:56.962 --> 00:05:59.986
So actually, if you want to go
and make your own mini-cemetery,

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.305
then you can.

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:04.757
But I mean, like -- really,
who does this? Right?

00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:09.629
Well, if you're an aristocratic family
and you have a large estate,

00:06:09.653 --> 00:06:12.336
then there's a chance that you'll
have a mausoleum on it,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.169
and you'll bury your family there.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.867
But the really weird thing

00:06:16.891 --> 00:06:20.260
is that you don't need to have
a piece of land of a certain size

00:06:20.284 --> 00:06:22.886
before you're allowed
to start burying people on it.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.855
And so that means that, technically,

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.568
this applies to, like, the back garden
of your house in the suburbs.

00:06:28.592 --> 00:06:29.921
(Laughter)

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.394
So what if you wanted
to try this yourself at home?

00:06:34.418 --> 00:06:38.466
Well, there's a few councils
that have guidance on their website

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.877
which can help you.

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:41.995
So, the first thing that they tell you

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:45.755
is that you need to have a certificate
of burial before you can go ahead --

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:49.127
you're not allowed to just murder people
and put them under the patio.

00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:51.151
(Laughter)

00:06:52.253 --> 00:06:56.056
They also tell you that you need to keep
a record of where the grave is.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.713
But that's pretty much it
for formal requirements.

00:06:58.737 --> 00:07:01.739
Now, they do warn you that
your neighbors might not like this,

00:07:01.763 --> 00:07:05.666
but, legally speaking, there's almost
nothing that they can do about it.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.856
And just in case any of you
still had that profit idea in your mind

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.141
about how much those burial plots cost

00:07:13.165 --> 00:07:15.513
and how much money
you might be able to make,

00:07:15.537 --> 00:07:18.283
they also warn that it might cause
the value of your house

00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:20.037
to drop by 20 percent.

00:07:20.515 --> 00:07:22.262
Although, actually, it's more likely

00:07:22.286 --> 00:07:25.254
that no one will want to buy
your house at all after that.

00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:28.900
So what I find fascinating about this

00:07:28.924 --> 00:07:33.589
is the fact that it kind of sums up
many of our attitudes towards death.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.696
In the UK, and I think that the figures
across Europe are probably similar,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.831
only about 30 percent of people
have ever talked to anyone

00:07:41.855 --> 00:07:43.547
about their wishes around death,

00:07:43.571 --> 00:07:45.481
and even for people over 75,

00:07:45.505 --> 00:07:49.091
only 45 percent of people
have ever talked about this.

00:07:49.464 --> 00:07:52.139
And the reasons that
people give ... you know,

00:07:52.163 --> 00:07:53.984
they think that their death is far off

00:07:54.008 --> 00:07:56.885
or they think that they're going
to make people uncomfortable

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.295
by talking about it.

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:00.074
And you know, to a certain extent,

00:08:00.098 --> 00:08:03.736
there are other people out there
who are taking care of things for us.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.441
The government has all this regulation
and bureaucracy around things

00:08:07.465 --> 00:08:09.698
like burying a death, for example,

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:11.691
and there's people like funeral directors

00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:14.311
who devote their entire
working lives to this issue.

00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:15.841
But when it comes to our cities

00:08:15.865 --> 00:08:18.907
and thinking about how
death fits in our cities,

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:22.980
there's much less regulation
and design and thought

00:08:23.004 --> 00:08:24.320
than we might imagine.

00:08:24.344 --> 00:08:26.558
So we're not thinking about this,

00:08:26.582 --> 00:08:29.482
but all of the people we imagine
are thinking about it --

00:08:29.506 --> 00:08:31.551
they're not taking care of it either.

00:08:31.575 --> 00:08:32.733
Thank you.

00:08:32.757 --> 00:08:35.715
(Applause)
