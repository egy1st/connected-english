00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.776
Pat Mitchell: So I was thinking
about female friendship a lot,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.056
and by the way, these two women,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.456
I'm very honored to say,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.416
have been my friends
for a very long time, too.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.656
Jane Fonda: Yes we have.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.176
PM: And one of the things
that I read about female friendship

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.816
is something that Cervantes said.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.216
He said, "You can tell
a lot about someone,"

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.456
in this case a woman,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.896
"by the company that she keeps."

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.136
So let's start with --

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.360
(Laughter)

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.936
JF: We're in big trouble.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.936
Lily Tomlin: Hand me one of those waters,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.176
I'm extremely dry.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.040
(Laughter)

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.720
JF: You're taking up our time.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.936
We have a very limited --

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.296
LT: Just being with her
sucks the life out of me.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.096
(Laughter)

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.856
JF: You ain't seen nothing yet.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.096
Anyway -- sorry.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.496
PM: So tell me, what do you
look for in a friend?

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.096
LT: I look for someone
who has a sense of fun,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.096
who's audacious,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.576
who's forthcoming, who has politics,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.456
who has even a small scrap
of passion for the planet,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.096
someone who's decent,
has a sense of justice

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.216
and who thinks I'm worthwhile.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.216
(Laughter)

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.000
(Applause)

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.776
JF: You know, I was thinking this morning,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.616
I don't even know what I would do
without my women friends.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.656
I mean it's, "I have my friends,
therefore I am."

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.896
LT: (Laughter)

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.136
JF: No, it's true.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.399
I exist because I have
my women friends. They --

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.536
You're one of them.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.322
I don't know about you. But anyway --

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:40.496
(Laughter)

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.096
You know, they make me stronger,
they make me smarter,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.696
they make me braver.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.496
They tap me on the shoulder when I might
be in need of course-correcting.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.216
And most of them are
a good deal younger than me, too.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.896
You know? I mean, it's nice --
LT: Thank you.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.376
(Laughter)

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.456
JF: No, I do, I include you in that,
because listen, you know --

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.656
it's nice to have somebody still around
to play with and learn from

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.576
when you're getting toward the end.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.896
I'm approaching --
I'll be there sooner than you.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.616
LT: No, I'm glad to have you
parallel aging alongside me.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.696
(Laughter)

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.216
JF: I'm showing you the way.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.456
(Laughter)

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.376
LT: Well, you are and you have.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.736
PM: Well, as we grow older,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.616
and as we go through
different kinds of life's journeys,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.160
what do you do to keep
your friendships vital and alive?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.856
LT: Well you have to use a lot of --

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.536
JF: She doesn't invite me over much,
I'll tell you that.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.576
LT: I have to use a lot of social media --

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.096
You be quiet now. And so --

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.416
(Laughter)

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.456
LT: And I look through my emails,
I look through my texts

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.696
to find my friends,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.816
so I can answer them
as quickly as possible,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.256
because I know they need my counsel.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.056
(Laughter)

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.336
They need my support,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.456
because most of my friends
are writers, or activists, or actors,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.776
and you're all three ...

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.416
and a long string
of other descriptive phrases,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.736
and I want to get to you
as soon as possible,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.816
I want you to know that I'm there for you.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.136
JF: Do you do emojis?

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.056
LT: Oh ...
JF: No?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.536
LT: That's embarrassing.
JF: I'm really into emojis.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.976
LT: No, I spell out my --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.776
I spell out my words of happiness
and congratulations,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.456
and sadness.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.896
JF: You spell it right out --

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.301
LT: I spell it, every letter.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:21.896
(Laughter)

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.096
JF: Such a purist.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.056
You know, as I've gotten older,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.296
I've understood more
the importance of friendships,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.176
and so, I really make an effort

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.816
to reach out and make play dates --
not let too much time go by.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.056
I read a lot

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.016
so, as Lily knows all too well,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.096
my books that I like,
I send to my friends.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.056
LT: When we knew we would be here today

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.896
you sent me a lot of books
about women, female friendships,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.456
and I was so surprised
to see how many books,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.816
how much research
has been done recently --

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.336
JF: And were you grateful?
LT: I was grateful.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.640
(Laughter)

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.616
PM: And --

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.816
LT: Wait, no, it's really important
because this is another example

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.216
of how women are overlooked,
put aside, marginalized.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.016
There's been very little
research done on us,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.016
even though we volunteered lots of times.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.296
JF: That's for sure.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.936
(Laughter)

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.176
LT: This is really exciting,
and you all will be interested in this.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.896
The Harvard Medical School study has shown

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.136
that women who have
close female friendships

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.776
are less likely to develop impairments --

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.936
physical impairments as they age,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.456
and they are likely to be seen
to be living much more vital, exciting --

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.696
JF: And longer --

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.936
LT: Joyful lives.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.856
JF: We live five years longer than men.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.936
LT: I think I'd trade the years for joy.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.640
(Laughter)

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.976
LT: But the most important
part is they found --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.856
the results were so exciting
and so conclusive --

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.776
the researchers found

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.536
that not having close female friends
is detrimental to your health,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.536
as much as smoking or being overweight.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.416
JF: And there's something else, too --

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.856
LT: I've said my part, so ...

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.896
(Laughter)

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.576
JF: OK, well, listen to my part,
because there's an additional thing.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.776
Because they only --
for years, decades --

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.056
they only researched men when they
were trying to understand stress,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.576
only very recently have they researched
what happens to women when we're stressed,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.936
and it turns out
that when we're stressed -- women,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.176
our bodies get flooded by oxytocin.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.696
Which is a feel-good, calming,
stress-reducing hormone.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.776
Which is also increased
when we're with our women friends.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.176
And I do think that's one reason
why we live longer.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.816
And I feel so bad for men
because they don't have that.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.056
Testosterone in men
diminishes the effects of oxytocin.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.296
LT: Well, when you and I
and Dolly made "9 to 5" ...

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.536
JF: Oh --

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.616
LT: We laughed, we did,
we laughed so much,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.336
we found we had so much in common
and we're so different.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.075
Here she is, like Hollywood royalty,

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.176
I'm like a tough kid from Detroit,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.896
[Dolly's] a Southern kid
from a poor town in Tennessee,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.336
and we found we were so in sync as women,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.576
and we must have --

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.736
we laughed -- we must have added
at least a decade onto our lifespans.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.536
JF: I think -- we sure
crossed our legs a lot.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.536
(Laughter)

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.176
If you know what I mean.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.376
LT: I think we all know what you mean.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.416
(Laughter)

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.136
PM: You're adding decades
to our lives right now.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.096
So among the books that Jane
sent us both to read on female friendship

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.976
was one by a woman we admire greatly,
Sister Joan Chittister,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.096
who said about female friendship

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.376
that women friends
are not just a social act,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.296
they're a spiritual act.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.536
Do you think of your friends as spiritual?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.976
Do they add something
spiritual to your lives?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.016
LT: Spiritual -- I absolutely think that.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.096
Because -- especially people
you've known a long time,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.696
people you've spent time with --

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.776
I can see the spiritual
essence inside them,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.720
the tenderness, the vulnerability.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.616
There's actually kind of a love,
an element of love in the relationship.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.296
I just see deeply into your soul.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.776
PM: Do you think that, Jane --

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.360
LT: But I have special powers.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.016
JF: Well, there's all kinds of friends.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.576
There's business friends,
and party friends,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.016
I've got a lot of those.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.016
(Laughter)

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.920
But the oxytocin-producing
friendships have ...

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.816
They feel spiritual
because it's a heart opening, right?

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.560
You know, we go deep. And --

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.840
I find that I shed tears a lot
with my intimate friends.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.336
Not because I'm sad but because
I'm so touched and inspired by them.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.640
LT: And you know one of you
is going to go soon.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.280
(Laughter)

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.976
PM: Well, two of us are sitting here,
Lily, which one are you talking about?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.376
(Laughter)

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.216
And I always think, when women
talk about their friendships,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.496
that men always look a little mystified.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.056
What are the differences, in your opinion,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.056
between men friendships
and women friendships?

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.056
JF: There's a lot of difference,

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.016
and I think we have to have
a lot of empathy for men --

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.736
(Laughter)

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.480
that they don't have what we have.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.576
Which I think may be why they die sooner.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.135
(Laughter)

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.856
I have a lot of compassion for men,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.496
because women, no kidding, we --

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:47.136
women's relationships, our friendships
are full disclosure, we go deep.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.600
They're revelatory.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.096
We risk vulnerability --
this is something men don't do.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.656
I mean how many times
have I asked you, "Am I doing OK?"

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.936
"Did I really screw up there?"

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.336
PM: You're doing great.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.456
(Laughter)

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.616
JF: But I mean, we ask questions like that

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.856
of our women friends,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.896
and men don't.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.816
You know, people describe women's
relationships as face-to-face,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.856
whereas men's friendships
are more side-by-side.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.616
LT: I mean most of the time
men don't want to reveal their emotions,

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.336
they want to bury deeper feelings.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.376
I mean, that's the general,
conventional thought.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.936
They would rather go off in their man cave
and watch a game or hit golf balls,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.576
or talk about sports,
or hunting, or cars or have sex.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.856
I mean, it's just the kind of --
it's a more manly behavior.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.176
JF: You meant --
LT: They talk about sex.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.896
I meant they might have sex

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.296
if they could get somebody
in their man cave to --

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.080
(Laughter)

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.576
JF: You know something, though,
that I find very interesting --

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.176
and again, psychologists didn't know this
until relatively recently --

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.936
is that men are born every bit
as relational as women are.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.576
If you look at films
of newborn baby boys and girls,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.696
you'll see the baby boys
just like the girls,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.056
gazing into their mother's eyes,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.256
you know, needing that relational
exchange of energy.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.576
When the mother looks away,
they could see the dismay on the child,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.856
even the boy would cry.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.736
They need relationship.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.736
So the question is why,
as they grow older, does that change?

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.096
And the answer is patriarchal culture,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.096
which says to boys and young men

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.376
that to be needing of relationship,
to be emotional with someone is girly.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:39.056
That a real man doesn't ask
directions or express a need,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.376
they don't go to doctors if they feel bad.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.976
They don't ask for help.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.696
There's a quote that I really like,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.456
"Men fear that becoming 'we'
will erase his 'I'."

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.176
You know, his sense of self.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.696
Whereas women's sense of self
has always been kind of porous.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.536
But our "we" is our saving grace,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.016
it's what makes us strong.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.776
It's not that we're better than men,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.848
we just don't have
our masculinity to prove.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.656
LT: And, well --

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.336
JF: That's a Gloria Steinem quote.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.736
So we can express our humanity --
LT: I know who Gloria Steinem is.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.237
JF: I know you know who she is,
but I think it's a --

00:11:15.261 --> 00:11:17.296
(Laughter)

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.176
No, but it's a great quote, I think.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.456
We're not better than men, we just
don't have our masculinity to prove.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.856
And that's really important.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.456
LT: But men are
so inculcated in the culture

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.616
to be comfortable in the patriarchy.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.576
And we've got to make
something different happen.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.776
JF: Women's friendships
are like a renewable source of power.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.256
LT: Well, that's what's exciting
about this subject.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.816
It's because our friendships --

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.456
female friendships
are just a hop to our sisterhood,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.896
and sisterhood can be
a very powerful force,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.336
to give the world --

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.176
to make it what it should be --

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.120
the things that humans desperately need.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.656
PM: It is why we're talking about it,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.376
because women's friendships are,

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.616
as you said, Jane,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.976
a renewable source of power.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.480
So how do we use that power?

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.136
JF: Well, women are the fastest growing
demographic in the world,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.376
especially older women.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.456
And if we harness our power,
we can change the world.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.016
And guess what? We need to.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.176
(Applause)

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.496
And we need to do it soon.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.016
And one of the things
that we need to do --

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.576
and we can do it as women --

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.696
for one thing, we kind of set
the consumer standards.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.136
We need to consume less.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.136
We in the Western world
need to consume less

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.376
and when we buy things, we need to
buy things that are made locally,

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.496
when we buy food, we need to buy food
that's grown locally.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.736
We are the ones
that need to get off the grid.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:47.496
We need to make ourselves
independent from fossil fuels.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.496
And the fossil fuel companies --

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.656
the Exxons and the Shell Oils
and those bad guys --

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.896
cause they are --

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.776
are going to tell us that we can't do it
without going back to the Stone Age.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.656
You know, that the alternatives
just aren't quite there yet,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.016
and that's not true.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.096
There are countries in the world right now

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.456
that are living mostly on renewable
energy and doing just fine.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.616
And they tell us that if we do
wean ourselves from fossil fuel

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.776
that we're going to be
back in the Stone Age,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.976
and in fact, if we begin
to use renewable energy,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.166
and not drill in the Arctic,
and not drill --

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.356
LT: Oh, boy.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.496
JF: And not drill
in the Alberta tar sands --

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.736
Right.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.000
That we will be --

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.416
there will be more democracy
and more jobs and more well-being,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.656
and it's women that are
going to lead the way.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.056
LT: Maybe we have the momentum
to start a third-wave feminist movement

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.656
with our sisterhood around the world,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.856
with women we don't see,
women we may never meet,

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.376
but we join together that way,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.616
because --

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.840
Aristotle said --

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.136
most people --

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.056
people would die without male friendships.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.336
And the operative word here was "male."

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.296
Because they thought that friendships
should be between equals

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.536
and women were not considered equal --

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.016
JF: They didn't think
we had souls even, the Greeks.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.896
LT: No, exactly. That shows you
just how limited Aristotle was.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.600
(Laughter)

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.416
And wait, no, here's the best part.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.056
It's like, you know,
men do need women now.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.216
The planet needs women.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.696
The US Constitution needs women.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.496
We are not even in the Constitution.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.976
JF: You're talking about
the Equal Rights Amendment.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.158
LT: Right.

00:14:26.182 --> 00:14:30.080
Justice Ginsberg said something like --

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.496
every constitution that's been written
since the end of World War II

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.496
included a provision that made women
citizens of equal stature,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.216
but ours does not.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.136
So that would be a good place to start.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.216
Very, very mild --

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.456
JF: Right.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.680
(Applause)

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.856
And gender equality, it's like a tide,

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.816
it would lift all boats, not just women.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.376
PM: Needing new role models
on how to do that.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.816
How to be friends,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.736
how to think about our power
in different ways,

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.976
as consumers,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.656
as citizens of the world,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.096
and this is what makes Jane and Lily

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.856
a role model of how
women can be friends --

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.496
for a very long time,

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.936
and even if they occasionally disagree.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.160
Thank you.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.576
Thank you both.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.816
(Applause)

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.040
JF: Thanks.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.776
LT: Thank you.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.000
JF: Thank you.

00:15:26.053 --> 00:15:31.120
(Applause)
