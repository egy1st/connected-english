00:00:01.142 --> 00:00:02.294
Ten years ago,

00:00:02.318 --> 00:00:04.214
I had my first exhibition here.

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:08.654
I had no idea if it would work
or was at all possible,

00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:12.091
but with a few small steps
and a very steep learning curve,

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:15.358
I made my first sculpture,
called "The Lost Correspondent."

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:19.823
Teaming up with a marine biologist
and a local dive center,

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:22.516
I submerged the work
off the coast of Grenada,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.195
in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan.

00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:28.083
And then this incredible thing happened.

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:29.923
It transformed.

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:33.455
One sculpture became two.

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:37.154
Two quickly became 26.

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:39.907
And before I knew it,

00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:42.773
we had the world's first
underwater sculpture park.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.577
In 2009, I moved to Mexico
and started by casting local fisherman.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.790
This grew to a small community,

00:00:54.218 --> 00:00:57.886
to almost an entire movement of people
in defense of the sea.

00:00:59.228 --> 00:01:01.921
And then finally, to an underwater museum,

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:03.998
with over 500 living sculptures.

00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:08.934
Gardening, it seems,
is not just for greenhouses.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:14.017
We've since scaled up the designs:

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:18.151
"Ocean Atlas," in the Bahamas,
rising 16 feet up to the surface

00:01:18.175 --> 00:01:19.897
and weighing over 40 tons,

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:23.613
to now currently in Lanzarote,

00:01:23.637 --> 00:01:26.772
where I'm making
an underwater botanical garden,

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:29.102
the first of its kind
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:35.084
Each project, we use materials
and designs that help encourage life;

00:01:35.108 --> 00:01:40.905
a long-lasting pH-neutral cement
provides a stable and permanent platform.

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:44.262
It is textured to allow
coral polyps to attach.

00:01:45.262 --> 00:01:47.979
We position them down current
from natural reefs

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.445
so that after spawning,
there's areas for them to settle.

00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:56.835
The formations are all configured
so that they aggregate fish

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.516
on a really large scale.

00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:04.479
Even this VW Beetle
has an internal living habitat

00:02:04.503 --> 00:02:08.465
to encourage crustaceans
such as lobsters and sea urchins.

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:13.473
So why exhibit my work in the ocean?

00:02:13.497 --> 00:02:16.035
Because honestly, it's really not easy.

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.264
When you're in the middle of the sea
under a hundred-foot crane,

00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:22.383
trying to lower eight tons
down to the sea floor,

00:02:22.407 --> 00:02:26.336
you start to wonder whether I shouldn't
have taken up watercolor painting instead.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.361
(Laughter)

00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:30.098
But in the end, the results
always blow my mind.

00:02:30.122 --> 00:02:34.102
(Music)

00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:55.711
The ocean is the most
incredible exhibition space

00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:57.406
an artist could ever wish for.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.783
You have amazing lighting effects
changing by the hour,

00:03:00.807 --> 00:03:05.124
explosions of sand covering
the sculptures in a cloud of mystery,

00:03:05.148 --> 00:03:07.052
a unique timeless quality

00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:09.116
and the procession
of inquisitive visitors,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.873
each lending their own
special touch to the site.

00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:16.165
(Music)

00:03:39.288 --> 00:03:40.439
But over the years,

00:03:40.463 --> 00:03:43.822
I've realized that the greatest
thing about what we do,

00:03:43.846 --> 00:03:46.345
the really humbling thing about the work,

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:48.582
is that as soon as we
submerge the sculptures,

00:03:48.606 --> 00:03:50.132
they're not ours anymore,

00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:51.704
because as soon as we sink them,

00:03:51.728 --> 00:03:53.989
the sculptures, they belong to the sea.

00:03:54.013 --> 00:03:58.032
As new reefs form, a new world
literally starts to evolve,

00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:00.257
a world that continuously amazes me.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.218
It's a bit of a cliché,
but nothing man-made

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.733
can ever match the imagination of nature.

00:04:06.591 --> 00:04:09.511
Sponges look like veins across the faces.

00:04:10.478 --> 00:04:13.303
Staghorn coral morphs the form.

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:17.977
Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed.

00:04:19.557 --> 00:04:22.731
Tunicates explode from the faces.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:28.009
Sea urchins crawl across
the bodies feeding at night.

00:04:30.752 --> 00:04:33.941
Coralline algae applies
a kind of purple paint.

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:39.284
The deepest red I've ever seen
in my life lives underwater.

00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:44.951
Gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves.

00:04:47.002 --> 00:04:49.719
Purple sponges breathe water like air.

00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:54.527
And grey angelfish
glide silently overhead.

00:04:56.832 --> 00:04:59.193
And the amazing response
we've had to these works

00:04:59.217 --> 00:05:03.370
tells me that we've managed
to plug into something really primal,

00:05:03.394 --> 00:05:07.219
because it seems that these images
translate across the world,

00:05:07.243 --> 00:05:11.084
and that's made me focus
on my responsibility as an artist

00:05:11.108 --> 00:05:13.242
and about what I'm trying to achieve.

00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:17.539
I'm standing here today on this boat
in the middle of the ocean,

00:05:17.563 --> 00:05:19.286
and this couldn't be a better place

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.437
to talk about the really,
really important effect of my work.

00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:25.121
Because as we all know,

00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:28.191
our reefs are dying,
and our oceans are in trouble.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.430
So here's the thing:

00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:33.217
the most used, searched and shared image

00:05:33.241 --> 00:05:36.121
of all my work thus far is this.

00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:39.406
And I think this is for a reason,

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.949
or at least I hope it is.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.700
What I really hope is that people
are beginning to understand

00:05:44.724 --> 00:05:48.392
that when we think of the environment
and the destruction of nature,

00:05:48.416 --> 00:05:51.282
that we need to start thinking
about our oceans, too.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:54.215
Since building these sites,
we've seen some phenomenal

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:55.814
and unexpected results.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.409
Besides creating over 800 square meters
of new habitats and living reef,

00:06:01.433 --> 00:06:05.457
visitors to the marine park in Cancun
now divide half their time

00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:08.013
between the museum and the natural reefs,

00:06:08.037 --> 00:06:12.010
providing significant rest
for natural, overstressed areas.

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:16.726
Visitors to "Ocean Atlas"
in the Bahamas highlighted a leak

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.559
from a nearby oil refinery.

00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.576
The subsequent international media
forced the local government

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.449
to pledge 10 million dollars
in coastal cleanups.

00:06:26.154 --> 00:06:28.528
The sculpture park in Grenada
was instrumental

00:06:28.552 --> 00:06:32.819
in the government designating a spot --
a marine-protected area.

00:06:32.843 --> 00:06:36.202
Entrance fees to the park
now help fund park rangers

00:06:36.226 --> 00:06:38.812
to manage tourism and fishing quotas.

00:06:39.293 --> 00:06:41.901
The site was actually listed
as a "Wonder of the World"

00:06:41.925 --> 00:06:43.164
by National Geographic.

00:06:44.297 --> 00:06:46.877
So why are we all here today in this room?

00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:48.902
What do we all have in common?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.195
I think we all share a fear

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:53.353
that we don't protect our oceans enough.

00:06:53.837 --> 00:06:55.484
And one way of thinking about this

00:06:55.508 --> 00:06:58.853
is that we don't regard
our oceans as sacred,

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.115
and we should.

00:07:00.572 --> 00:07:02.135
When we see incredible places --

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:06.097
like the Himalayas
or the La Sagrada Família,

00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:07.782
or the Mona Lisa, even --

00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:10.695
when we see these incredible
places and things,

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:12.764
we understand their importance.

00:07:12.788 --> 00:07:14.178
We call them sacred,

00:07:14.202 --> 00:07:17.859
and we do our best
to cherish them, to protect them

00:07:17.883 --> 00:07:19.477
and to keep them safe.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.185
But in order to do that,

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:24.539
we are the ones that have
to assign that value;

00:07:24.563 --> 00:07:26.096
otherwise, it will be desecrated

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.744
by someone who doesn't
understand that value.

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:33.384
So I want to finish up tonight
by talking about sacred things.

00:07:33.408 --> 00:07:35.562
When we were naming the site in Cancun,

00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:39.904
we named it a museum for a very
important and simple reason:

00:07:39.928 --> 00:07:42.355
museums are places of preservation,

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.173
of conservation and of education.

00:07:45.524 --> 00:07:48.960
They're places where we keep
objects of great value to us,

00:07:48.984 --> 00:07:52.093
where we simply treasure them
for them being themselves.

00:07:52.966 --> 00:07:55.753
If someone was to throw
an egg at the Sistine Chapel,

00:07:55.777 --> 00:07:57.307
we'd all go crazy.

00:07:57.704 --> 00:08:00.170
If someone wanted
to build a seven-star hotel

00:08:00.194 --> 00:08:02.009
at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,

00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:04.161
then we would laugh them out of Arizona.

00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:08.903
Yet every day we dredge, pollute
and overfish our oceans.

00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:11.333
And I think it's easier for us to do that,

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:13.453
because when we see the ocean,

00:08:13.477 --> 00:08:15.405
we don't see the havoc we're wreaking.

00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:16.999
Because for most people,

00:08:17.023 --> 00:08:18.523
the ocean is like this.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.131
And it's really hard

00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:25.573
to think of something that's just
so plain and so enormous, as fragile.

00:08:25.597 --> 00:08:28.950
It's simply too massive,
too vast, too endless.

00:08:29.387 --> 00:08:30.610
And what do you see here?

00:08:30.634 --> 00:08:33.323
I think most people actually
look past to the horizon.

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:35.402
So I think there's a real danger

00:08:35.426 --> 00:08:38.313
that we never really see the sea,

00:08:38.337 --> 00:08:39.846
and if we don't really see it,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.269
if it doesn't have its own iconography,

00:08:42.293 --> 00:08:44.305
if we miss its majesty,

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:47.327
then there's a big danger
that we take it for granted.

00:08:48.772 --> 00:08:52.089
Cancun is famous for spring break,

00:08:52.113 --> 00:08:54.372
tequila and foam parties.

00:08:54.396 --> 00:08:57.939
And its waters are where frat boys
can ride around on Jet Skis

00:08:57.963 --> 00:08:59.225
and banana boats.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.603
But because of our work there,
there's now a little corner of Cancun

00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:06.309
that is simply precious for being itself.

00:09:07.071 --> 00:09:09.702
And we don't want to stop in Grenada,

00:09:09.726 --> 00:09:12.036
in Cancun or the Bahamas.

00:09:12.496 --> 00:09:16.387
Just last month, I installed
these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:17.911
in the Thames River,

00:09:19.062 --> 00:09:22.564
in central London, right in front
of the Houses of Parliament,

00:09:22.588 --> 00:09:25.545
putting a stark message
about climate change

00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:29.393
in front of the people that have
the power to help change things.

00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:34.087
Because for me, this is just
the beginning of the mission.

00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:36.617
We want to team up with other inventors,

00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:40.562
creators, philanthropists,
educators, biologists,

00:09:40.586 --> 00:09:42.960
to see better futures for our oceans.

00:09:42.984 --> 00:09:45.532
And we want to see beyond sculpture,

00:09:45.556 --> 00:09:46.964
beyond art, even.

00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:50.413
Say you're a 14-year-old kid from the city,

00:09:50.437 --> 00:09:52.159
and you've never seen the ocean.

00:09:52.476 --> 00:09:56.069
And instead of getting taken
to the natural history museum

00:09:56.093 --> 00:09:57.681
or an aquarium,

00:09:57.705 --> 00:10:00.227
you get taken out to the ocean,

00:10:00.251 --> 00:10:03.012
to an underwater Noah's Ark,

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:07.006
which you can access
through a dry-glass viewing tunnel,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.432
where you can see
all the wildlife of the land

00:10:09.456 --> 00:10:11.805
be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.216
Clearly, it would blow your mind.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.251
So let's think big and let's think deep.

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:22.005
Who knows where our imagination
and willpower can lead us?

00:10:22.029 --> 00:10:24.977
I hope that by bringing
our art into the ocean,

00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:28.530
that not only do we take advantage
of amazing creativity

00:10:28.554 --> 00:10:30.689
and visual impact of the setting,

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:33.159
but that we are also
giving something back,

00:10:33.183 --> 00:10:36.541
and by encouraging
new environments to thrive,

00:10:36.565 --> 00:10:41.634
and in some way opening up a new --
or maybe it's a really old way

00:10:41.658 --> 00:10:43.725
of seeing the seas:

00:10:43.749 --> 00:10:47.279
as delicate, precious places,

00:10:47.303 --> 00:10:49.072
worthy of our protection.

00:10:49.896 --> 00:10:51.651
Our oceans are sacred.

00:10:51.675 --> 00:10:53.176
Thank you.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.134
(Applause)
