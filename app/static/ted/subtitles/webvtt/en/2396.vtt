00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.176
A hundred years ago this month,
a 36-year-old Albert Einstein

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.456
stood up in front of the Prussian
Academy of Sciences in Berlin

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.936
to present a radical new theory
of space, time and gravity:

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.976
the general theory of relativity.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.056
General relativity is unquestionably
Einstein's masterpiece,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.056
a theory which reveals the workings
of the universe at the grandest scales,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.456
capturing in one beautiful line of algebra

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.000
everything from why apples fall from trees
to the beginning of time and space.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.816
1915 must have been an exciting year
to be a physicist.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.336
Two new ideas were turning
the subject on its head.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.696
One was Einstein's theory of relativity,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.896
the other was arguably
even more revolutionary:

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.376
quantum mechanics,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.936
a mind-meltingly strange
yet stunningly successful new way

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.240
of understanding the microworld,
the world of atoms and particles.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.576
Over the last century,
these two ideas have utterly transformed

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.336
our understanding of the universe.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.696
It's thanks to relativity
and quantum mechanics

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.056
that we've learned
what the universe is made from,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.599
how it began
and how it continues to evolve.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.656
A hundred years on, we now find ourselves
at another turning point in physics,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.160
but what's at stake now
is rather different.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.296
The next few years may tell us
whether we'll be able

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.176
to continue to increase
our understanding of nature,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.616
or whether maybe for the first time
in the history of science,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.576
we could be facing questions
that we cannot answer,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.176
not because we don't have
the brains or technology,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.440
but because the laws of physics
themselves forbid it.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.136
This is the essential problem:
the universe is far, far too interesting.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.816
Relativity and quantum mechanics
appear to suggest

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.136
that the universe
should be a boring place.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.056
It should be dark, lethal and lifeless.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.016
But when we look around us, we see we live
in a universe full of interesting stuff,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.096
full of stars, planets, trees, squirrels.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.616
The question is, ultimately,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.936
why does all this interesting stuff exist?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.040
Why is there something
rather than nothing?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.576
This contradiction is the most pressing
problem in fundamental physics,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.320
and in the next few years, we may find out
whether we'll ever be able to solve it.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.176
At the heart of this problem
are two numbers,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.696
two extremely dangerous numbers.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.416
These are properties of the universe
that we can measure,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.976
and they're extremely dangerous

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.416
because if they were different,
even by a tiny bit,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.160
then the universe as we know it
would not exist.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.176
The first of these numbers is associated
with the discovery that was made

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.176
a few kilometers from this hall,
at CERN, home of this machine,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.256
the largest scientific device
ever built by the human race,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.136
the Large Hadron Collider.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.136
The LHC whizzes subatomic particles
around a 27-kilometer ring,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.616
getting them closer and closer
to the speed of light

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.296
before smashing them into each other
inside gigantic particle detectors.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.816
On July 4, 2012, physicists
at CERN announced to the world

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.376
that they'd spotted
a new fundamental particle

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.760
being created at the violent collisions
at the LHC: the Higgs boson.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.496
Now, if you followed the news at the time,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.576
you'll have seen a lot of physicists
getting very excited indeed,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.256
and you'd be forgiven for thinking

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.816
we get that way every time
we discover a new particle.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.176
Well, that is kind of true,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.896
but the Higgs boson
is particularly special.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.376
We all got so excited
because finding the Higgs

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.736
proves the existence
of a cosmic energy field.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.376
Now, you may have trouble
imagining an energy field,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.829
but we've all experienced one.

00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:27.389
If you've ever held a magnet
close to a piece of metal

00:03:27.413 --> 00:03:29.536
and felt a force pulling across that gap,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.418
then you've felt the effect of a field.

00:03:31.442 --> 00:03:34.816
And the Higgs field
is a little bit like a magnetic field,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.656
except it has a constant value everywhere.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.136
It's all around us right now.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.896
We can't see it or touch it,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.136
but if it wasn't there,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.600
we would not exist.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.976
The Higgs field gives mass

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.376
to the fundamental particles
that we're made from.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.016
If it wasn't there, those particles
would have no mass,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.720
and no atoms could form
and there would be no us.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.336
But there is something deeply mysterious
about the Higgs field.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.056
Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us
that it has two natural settings,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.736
a bit like a light switch.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.136
It should either be off,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.816
so that it has a zero value
everywhere in space,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.200
or it should be on so it has
an absolutely enormous value.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.576
In both of these scenarios,
atoms could not exist,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.736
and therefore all the other
interesting stuff

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.399
that we see around us
in the universe would not exist.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.616
In reality, the Higgs field
is just slightly on,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.696
not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker
than its fully on value,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.840
a bit like a light switch that's got stuck
just before the off position.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.096
And this value is crucial.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.976
If it were a tiny bit different,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.656
then there would be
no physical structure in the universe.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.856
So this is the first
of our dangerous numbers,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.936
the strength of the Higgs field.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.696
Theorists have spent decades
trying to understand

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.376
why it has this very peculiarly
fine-tuned number,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.216
and they've come up
with a number of possible explanations.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.176
They have sexy-sounding names
like "supersymmetry"

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.136
or "large extra dimensions."

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.936
I'm not going to go
into the details of these ideas now,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.336
but the key point is this:

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.216
if any of them explained this weirdly
fine-tuned value of the Higgs field,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.976
then we should see new particles
being created at the LHC

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.976
along with the Higgs boson.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.960
So far, though, we've not seen
any sign of them.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.016
But there's actually an even worse example

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.416
of this kind of fine-tuning
of a dangerous number,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.056
and this time it comes
from the other end of the scale,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.936
from studying the universe
at vast distances.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.296
One of the most important consequences
of Einstein's general theory of relativity

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.736
was the discovery that the universe began
as a rapid expansion of space and time

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.536
13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.216
Now, according to early versions
of the Big Bang theory,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.416
the universe has been expanding ever since

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.496
with gravity gradually putting
the brakes on that expansion.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.856
But in 1998, astronomers made
the stunning discovery

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.696
that the expansion of the universe
is actually speeding up.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.856
The universe is getting
bigger and bigger faster and faster

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.720
driven by a mysterious repulsive force
called dark energy.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.696
Now, whenever you hear
the word "dark" in physics,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.216
you should get very suspicious

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.296
because it probably means
we don't know what we're talking about.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.336
(Laughter)

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.376
We don't know what dark energy is,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.136
but the best idea is that it's the energy
of empty space itself,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.376
the energy of the vacuum.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.936
Now, if you use good old
quantum mechanics to work out

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.576
how strong dark energy should be,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.816
you get an absolutely astonishing result.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.696
You find that dark energy

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.696
should be 10 to the power
of 120 times stronger

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.536
than the value we observe from astronomy.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.376
That's one with 120 zeroes after it.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.976
This is a number so mind-bogglingly huge

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.216
that it's impossible
to get your head around.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.736
We often use the word "astronomical"
when we're talking about big numbers.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.416
Well, even that one won't do here.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.856
This number is bigger
than any number in astronomy.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.976
It's a thousand trillion
trillion trillion times bigger

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.640
than the number of atoms
in the entire universe.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.256
So that's a pretty bad prediction.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.995
In fact, it's been called
the worst prediction in physics,

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:08.296
and this is more than just
a theoretical curiosity.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.056
If dark energy were
anywhere near this strong,

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.216
then the universe
would have been torn apart,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.560
stars and galaxies could not form,
and we would not be here.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.576
So this is the second
of those dangerous numbers,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.976
the strength of dark energy,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.936
and explaining it requires an even more
fantastic level of fine-tuning

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.484
than we saw for the Higgs field.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.440
But unlike the Higgs field,
this number has no known explanation.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.456
The hope was that a complete combination

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.696
of Einstein's general
theory of relativity,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.296
which is the theory
of the universe at grand scales,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.776
with quantum mechanics, the theory
of the universe at small scales,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.656
might provide a solution.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.136
Einstein himself
spent most of his later years

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.336
on a futile search
for a unified theory of physics,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.736
and physicists have kept at it ever since.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.896
One of the most promising candidates
for a unified theory is string theory,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.216
and the essential idea is,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.736
if you could zoom in on the fundamental
particles that make up our world,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.416
you'd see actually
that they're not particles at all,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.056
but tiny vibrating strings of energy,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.416
with each frequency of vibration
corresponding to a different particle,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.000
a bit like musical notes
on a guitar string.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.056
So it's a rather elegant, almost poetic
way of looking at the world,

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.536
but it has one catastrophic problem.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.456
It turns out that string theory
isn't one theory at all,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.776
but a whole collection of theories.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.216
It's been estimated, in fact,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.176
that there are 10 to the 500
different versions of string theory.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.576
Each one would describe
a different universe

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.736
with different laws of physics.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.376
Now, critics say this makes
string theory unscientific.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.336
You can't disprove the theory.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.360
But others actually
turned this on its head

00:08:45.384 --> 00:08:47.656
and said, well,
maybe this apparent failure

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.016
is string theory's greatest triumph.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.416
What if all of these 10 to the 500
different possible universes

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.656
actually exist out there somewhere

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.800
in some grand multiverse?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.136
Suddenly we can understand

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.736
the weirdly fine-tuned values
of these two dangerous numbers.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.056
In most of the multiverse,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.056
dark energy is so strong
that the universe gets torn apart,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.416
or the Higgs field is so weak
that no atoms can form.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.616
We live in one of the places
in the multiverse

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.016
where the two numbers are just right.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.400
We live in a Goldilocks universe.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.496
Now, this idea is extremely controversial,
and it's easy to see why.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.416
If we follow this line of thinking,

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.816
then we will never be able
to answer the question,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.296
"Why is there something
rather than nothing?"

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.496
In most of the multiverse,
there is nothing,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.336
and we live in one of the few places

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.360
where the laws of physics
allow there to be something.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.496
Even worse, we can't test
the idea of the multiverse.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.656
We can't access these other universes,

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.920
so there's no way of knowing
whether they're there or not.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.976
So we're in an extremely
frustrating position.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.696
That doesn't mean
the multiverse doesn't exist.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.296
There are other planets,
other stars, other galaxies,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.496
so why not other universes?

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.880
The problem is, it's unlikely
we'll ever know for sure.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.056
Now, the idea of the multiverse
has been around for a while,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.336
but in the last few years,
we've started to get the first solid hints

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.120
that this line of reasoning
may get born out.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.656
Despite high hopes
for the first run of the LHC,

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.252
what we were looking for there --

00:10:20.276 --> 00:10:22.336
we were looking
for new theories of physics:

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.256
supersymmetry or large extra dimensions

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.496
that could explain this weirdly
fine-tuned value of the Higgs field.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.736
But despite high hopes, the LHC
revealed a barren subatomic wilderness

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.440
populated only by a lonely Higgs boson.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.016
My experiment published paper after paper

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.520
where we glumly had to conclude
that we saw no signs of new physics.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.056
The stakes now could not be higher.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.976
This summer, the LHC began
its second phase of operation

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.256
with an energy almost double
what we achieved in the first run.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.936
What particle physicists
are all desperately hoping for

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.736
are signs of new particles,
micro black holes,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.856
or maybe something totally unexpected

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.496
emerging from the violent collisions
at the Large Hadron Collider.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.856
If so, then we can continue
this long journey

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.456
that began 100 years ago
with Albert Einstein

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.000
towards an ever deeper understanding
of the laws of nature.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.776
But if, in two or three years' time,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.136
when the LHC switches off again
for a second long shutdown,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.456
we've found nothing but the Higgs boson,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.296
then we may be entering
a new era in physics:

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.096
an era where there are weird features
of the universe that we cannot explain;

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.176
an era where we have hints
that we live in a multiverse

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.976
that lies frustratingly
forever beyond our reach;

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.256
an era where we will never be able
to answer the question,

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.336
"Why is there something
rather than nothing?"

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.576
Thank you.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:51.016
(Applause)

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.096
Bruno Giussani: Harry,
even if you just said

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.976
the science may not have some answers,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.016
I would like to ask you a couple
of questions, and the first is:

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.056
building something like the LHC
is a generational project.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.376
I just mentioned, introducing you,
that we live in a short-term world.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.256
How do you think so long term,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.616
projecting yourself out a generation
when building something like this?

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.056
Harry Cliff: I was very lucky

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.896
that I joined the experiment
I work on at the LHC in 2008,

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.301
just as we were switching on,

00:12:18.325 --> 00:12:21.576
and there are people in my research group
who have been working on it

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.216
for three decades,
their entire careers on one machine.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.416
So I think the first conversations
about the LHC were in 1976,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.136
and you start planning the machine
without the technology

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.576
that you know you're going to need
to be able to build it.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.136
So the computing power
did not exist in the early '90s

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.780
when design work began in earnest.

00:12:36.804 --> 00:12:39.020
One of the big detectors
which record these collisions,

00:12:39.044 --> 00:12:40.896
they didn't think there was technology

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.776
that could withstand the radiation
that would be created in the LHC,

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.536
so there was basically a lump of lead
in the middle of this object

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.136
with some detectors around the outside,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.056
but subsequently
we have developed technology.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.416
So you have to rely on people's ingenuity,
that they will solve the problems,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.296
but it may be a decade
or more down the line.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.536
BG: China just announced
two or three weeks ago

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.016
that they intend to build

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.016
a supercollider twice the size of the LHC.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.656
I was wondering how you
and your colleagues welcome the news.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.416
HC: Size isn't everything, Bruno.
BG: I'm sure. I'm sure.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.216
(Laughter)

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.336
It sounds funny for a particle
physicist to say that.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.696
But I mean, seriously, it's great news.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.216
So building a machine like the LHC

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.016
requires countries from all over the world
to pool their resources.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.376
No one nation can afford
to build a machine this large,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.616
apart from maybe China,

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.856
because they can mobilize
huge amounts of resources,

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.936
manpower and money
to build machines like this.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.216
So it's only a good thing.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.576
What they're really planning to do
is to build a machine

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.336
that will study the Higgs boson in detail
and could give us some clues

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.296
as to whether these new ideas,
like supersymmetry, are really out there,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.225
so it's great news for physics, I think.

00:13:39.249 --> 00:13:41.425
BG: Harry, thank you.
HC: Thank you very much.

00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:44.640
(Applause)
