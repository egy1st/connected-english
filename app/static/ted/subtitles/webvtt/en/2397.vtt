00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:03.172
Bruno Giussani: Commissioner,
thank you for coming to TED.

00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:04.513
AntÃ³nio Guterres: Pleasure.

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:05.989
BG: Let's start with a figure.

00:00:06.013 --> 00:00:10.154
During 2015, almost one million refugees
and migrants arrived in Europe

00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:11.653
from many different countries,

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:14.375
of course, from Syria and Iraq,
but also from Afghanistan

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.861
and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere.

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:19.385
And there have been reactions
of two different kinds:

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:23.124
welcoming parties and border fences.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.205
But I want to look at it a little bit

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:28.059
from the short-term
and the long-term perspective.

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:31.575
And the first question is very simple:

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.067
Why has the movement of refugees
spiked so fast in the last six months?

00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:39.384
AG: Well, I think, basically,
what triggered this huge increase

00:00:39.408 --> 00:00:41.329
was the Syrian refugee group.

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:46.089
There has been an increased movement
into Europe from Africa, from Asia,

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:49.939
but slowly growing, and all of a sudden
we had this massive increase

00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:52.397
in the first months of this year.

00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:54.289
Why? I think there are three reasons,

00:00:54.313 --> 00:00:56.346
two long-term ones and the trigger.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.918
The long-term ones,
in relation to Syrians,

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:05.549
is that hope is less and less
clear for people.

00:01:05.573 --> 00:01:07.605
I mean, they look at their own country

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:10.310
and they don't see much hope
to go back home,

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:12.279
because there is no political solution,

00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:15.358
so there is no light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:17.006
Second, the living conditions

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.356
of the Syrians in the neighboring
countries have been deteriorating.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.633
We just had research with the World Bank,

00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:26.993
and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan

00:01:27.017 --> 00:01:29.918
and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon

00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:32.804
live below the national poverty lines.

00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:35.761
Only half of the children go to school,

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.807
which means that people
are living very badly.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.755
Not only are they refugees, out of home,

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:43.231
not only have they suffered
what they have suffered,

00:01:43.255 --> 00:01:45.824
but they are living in very,
very dramatic conditions.

00:01:45.848 --> 00:01:48.168
And then the trigger
was when all of a sudden,

00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:49.895
international aid decreased.

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:52.712
The World Food Programme was forced,
for lack of resources,

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:55.800
to cut by 30 percent food support
to the Syrian refugees.

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.247
They're not allowed to work,

00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:00.799
so they are totally dependent
on international support,

00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:03.127
and they felt, "The world
is abandoning us."

00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:05.111
And that, in my opinion, was the trigger.

00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:06.770
All of a sudden, there was a rush,

00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:08.809
and people started to move
in large numbers

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:10.391
and, to be absolutely honest,

00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:12.614
if I had been in the same situation

00:02:12.638 --> 00:02:14.745
and I would have been brave
enough to do it,

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.472
I think I would have done the same.

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:20.761
BG: But I think what surprised
many people is it's not only sudden,

00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:22.985
but it wasn't supposed to be sudden.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.422
The war in Syria has been
happening for five years.

00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:29.106
Millions of refugees are in camps
and villages and towns around Syria.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.510
You have yourself warned
about the situation

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:34.817
and about the consequences
of a breakdown of Libya, for example,

00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:37.880
and yet Europe looked totally unprepared.

00:02:38.618 --> 00:02:41.077
AG: Well, unprepared because divided,

00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:44.379
and when you are divided,
you don't want to recognize the reality.

00:02:44.403 --> 00:02:46.260
You prefer to postpone decisions,

00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:48.720
because you do not have
the capacity to make them.

00:02:48.744 --> 00:02:52.206
And the proof is that even when
the spike occurred,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.533
Europe remained divided

00:02:53.557 --> 00:02:59.226
and was unable to put in place
a mechanism to manage the situation.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.941
You talk about one million people.

00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:02.536
It looks enormous,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.060
but the population of the European Union
is 550 million people,

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:11.449
which means we are talking about one
per every [550] Europeans.

00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:15.402
Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugee
per three Lebanese.

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:19.657
And Lebanon? Struggling,
of course, but it's managing.

00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:23.947
So, the question is: is this something
that could have been managed

00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:26.992
if -- not mentioning the most
important thing,

00:03:27.016 --> 00:03:29.388
which would have been
addressing the root causes,

00:03:29.412 --> 00:03:31.388
but forgetting about root causes for now,

00:03:31.412 --> 00:03:33.237
looking at the phenomenon as it is --

00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:37.551
if Europe were able to come
together in solidarity

00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:41.715
to create an adequate
reception capacity of entry points?

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.423
But for that, the countries at entry
points need to be massively supported,

00:03:46.447 --> 00:03:49.452
and then screening the people
with security checks

00:03:49.476 --> 00:03:50.881
and all the other mechanisms,

00:03:50.905 --> 00:03:54.410
distributing those that are coming
into all European countries,

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.667
according to the possibilities
of each country.

00:03:56.691 --> 00:03:58.967
I mean, if you look at
the relocation program

00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:02.054
that was approved by the Commission,
always too little too late,

00:04:02.078 --> 00:04:04.000
or by the Council, too little too late --

00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:05.509
BG: It's already breaking down.

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:07.990
AG: My country is supposed
to receive four thousand.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:10.021
Four thousand in Portugal means nothing.

00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:13.814
So this is perfectly manageable
if it is managed,

00:04:13.838 --> 00:04:17.248
but in the present circumstances,
the pressure is at the point of entry,

00:04:17.272 --> 00:04:20.731
and then, as people move
in this chaotic way through the Balkans,

00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:24.101
then they come to Germany,
Sweden, basically, and Austria.

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:27.631
They are the three countries that are,
in the end, receiving the refugees.

00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:30.187
The rest of Europe is looking
without doing much.

00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:32.570
BG: Let me try to bring up
three questions,

00:04:32.594 --> 00:04:34.091
playing a bit devil's advocate.

00:04:34.115 --> 00:04:37.037
I'll try to ask them, make them blunt.

00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:39.100
But I think the questions are very present

00:04:39.124 --> 00:04:41.377
in the minds of many people
in Europe right now,

00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:43.332
The first, of course, is about numbers.

00:04:43.356 --> 00:04:48.162
You say 550 million versus one million
is not much, but realistically,

00:04:48.186 --> 00:04:50.136
how many people can Europe take?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.672
AG: Well, that is a question
that has no answer,

00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:57.241
because refugees have
the right to be protected.

00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:01.114
And there is such a thing
as international law,

00:05:01.138 --> 00:05:05.507
so there is no way you can say,
"I take 10,000 and that's finished."

00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:07.318
I remind you of one thing:

00:05:07.342 --> 00:05:11.218
in Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis,
I remember one minister saying,

00:05:11.242 --> 00:05:14.217
"Turkey will be able to receive
up to 100,000 people."

00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:17.686
Turkey has now two million
three-hundred thousand

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.158
or something of the sort,
if you count all refugees.

00:05:20.182 --> 00:05:24.371
So I don't think it's fair to say
how many we can take.

00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:27.941
What it is fair to say is:
how we can we organize ourselves

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:30.710
to assume our international
responsibilities?

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:33.184
And Europe has not been able to do so,

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:36.759
because basically, Europe is divided
because there is no solidarity

00:05:36.783 --> 00:05:37.962
in the European project.

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:41.112
And it's not only about refugees;
there are many other areas.

00:05:41.136 --> 00:05:44.770
And let's be honest, this is the moment
in which we need more Europe

00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:46.330
instead of less Europe.

00:05:46.354 --> 00:05:50.973
But as the public less and less believes
in European institutions,

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:54.279
it is also each time more difficult
to convince the public

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:56.605
that we need more Europe
to solve these problems.

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:58.076
BG: We seem to be at the point

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.511
where the numbers turn into political
shifts, particularly domestically.

00:06:01.535 --> 00:06:03.407
We saw it again this weekend in France,

00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:05.883
but we have seen it over
and over in many countries:

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.640
in Poland and in Denmark
and in Switzerland and elsewhere,

00:06:08.664 --> 00:06:12.213
where the mood changes radically
because of the numbers,

00:06:12.237 --> 00:06:18.447
although they are not very significant
in absolute numbers.

00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:20.524
The Prime Minister of --

00:06:20.548 --> 00:06:22.270
AG: But, if I may, on these:

00:06:22.294 --> 00:06:25.595
I mean, what does a European see at home

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:28.215
in a village where there are no migrants?

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:32.867
What a European sees is, on television,

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:37.291
every single day, a few months ago,
opening the news every single day,

00:06:37.315 --> 00:06:39.753
a crowd coming, uncontrolled,

00:06:39.777 --> 00:06:41.517
moving from border to border,

00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:43.721
and the images on television
were of hundreds

00:06:43.745 --> 00:06:45.412
or thousands of people moving.

00:06:45.436 --> 00:06:48.616
And the idea is that nobody
is taking care of it --

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.989
this is happening without any
kind of management.

00:06:52.013 --> 00:06:54.838
And so their idea was,
"They are coming to my village."

00:06:54.862 --> 00:06:58.935
So there was this completely false idea
that Europe was being invaded

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:02.720
and our way of life is going to change,
and everything will --

00:07:02.744 --> 00:07:06.609
And the problem is that if this
had been properly managed,

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:08.495
if people had been properly received,

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:13.234
welcomed, sheltered at point of entry,
screened at point of entry,

00:07:13.258 --> 00:07:15.947
and the moved by plane
to different European countries,

00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:18.129
this would not have scared people.

00:07:18.153 --> 00:07:20.796
But, unfortunately, we have
a lot of people scared,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.843
just because Europe was not able
to do the job properly.

00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:25.859
BG: But there are villages in Germany

00:07:25.883 --> 00:07:29.219
with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees.

00:07:29.243 --> 00:07:31.217
So, what's your position?

00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:33.208
How do you imagine these people reacting?

00:07:33.232 --> 00:07:36.105
AG: If there would be a proper
management of the situation

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:39.209
and the proper distribution
of people all over Europe,

00:07:39.233 --> 00:07:42.209
you would always have
the percentage that I mentioned:

00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:44.035
one per each 2,000.

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:46.328
It is because things are not
properly managed

00:07:46.352 --> 00:07:48.112
that in the end we have situations

00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:54.553
that are totally impossible to live with,
and of course if you have a village --

00:07:54.577 --> 00:07:56.254
in Lebanon, there are many villages

00:07:56.278 --> 00:07:59.686
that have more Syrians than Lebanese;
Lebanon has been living with that.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.977
I'm not asking for the same
to happen in Europe,

00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:05.188
for all European villages to have
more refugees than inhabitants.

00:08:05.212 --> 00:08:08.267
What I am asking is for Europe
to do the job properly,

00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:11.712
and to be able to organize itself
to receive people

00:08:11.736 --> 00:08:14.664
as other countries in the world
were forced to do in the past.

00:08:14.688 --> 00:08:17.752
BG: So, if you look at the global
situation not only at Europe --

00:08:17.776 --> 00:08:19.065
(Applause)

00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:20.240
BG: Yes!

00:08:20.264 --> 00:08:24.898
(Applause)

00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:27.943
BG: If you look at the global situation,
so, not only at Europe,

00:08:27.967 --> 00:08:30.071
I know you can make
a long list of countries

00:08:30.095 --> 00:08:33.218
that are not really stepping up,

00:08:33.242 --> 00:08:35.690
but I'm more interested
in the other part --

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:37.904
is there somebody
who's doing the right thing?

00:08:38.402 --> 00:08:40.833
AG: Well, 86 percent
of the refugees in the world

00:08:40.857 --> 00:08:42.912
are in the developing world.

00:08:42.936 --> 00:08:46.256
And if you look at
countries like Ethiopia --

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.057
Ethiopia has received
more than 600,000 refugees.

00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:52.502
All the borders in Ethiopia are open.

00:08:53.304 --> 00:08:55.172
And they have, as a policy,

00:08:55.196 --> 00:08:59.292
they call the "people to people" policy
that every refugee should be received.

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:00.895
And they have South Sudanese,

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:02.927
they have Sudanese, they have Somalis.

00:09:02.951 --> 00:09:04.808
They have all the neighbors.

00:09:04.832 --> 00:09:06.596
They have Eritreans.

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:08.224
And, in general,

00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:12.428
African countries are extremely
welcoming of refugees coming,

00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:15.024
and I would say that in the Middle East

00:09:15.048 --> 00:09:20.241
and in Asia, we have seen a tendency
for borders to be open.

00:09:20.265 --> 00:09:23.630
Now we see some problems
with the Syrian situation,

00:09:23.654 --> 00:09:27.911
as the Syrian situation evolved
into also a major security crisis,

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:30.028
but the truth is that for a large period,

00:09:30.052 --> 00:09:32.044
all borders in the Middle East were open.

00:09:32.068 --> 00:09:33.520
The truth is that for Afghans,

00:09:33.544 --> 00:09:36.377
the borders of Pakistan and Iran
were open for, at the time,

00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:38.294
six million Afghans that came.

00:09:38.318 --> 00:09:42.139
So I would say that even today,
the trend in the developing world

00:09:42.163 --> 00:09:44.489
has been for borders to be open.

00:09:44.513 --> 00:09:48.925
The trend in the developed world
is for these questions to become

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:51.055
more and more complex,

00:09:51.079 --> 00:09:53.650
especially when there is,
in the public opinion,

00:09:53.674 --> 00:09:58.757
a mixture of discussions between refugee
protections on one side

00:09:58.781 --> 00:10:02.420
and security questions -- in my opinion,
misinterpreted -- on the other side.

00:10:02.444 --> 00:10:03.985
BG: We'll come back to that too,

00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:06.749
but you mentioned the cutting
of funding and the vouchers

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.233
from the World Food Programme.

00:10:08.257 --> 00:10:11.090
That reflects the general underfunding
of the organizations

00:10:11.114 --> 00:10:13.430
working on these issues.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.710
Now that the world seems to have woken up,

00:10:16.734 --> 00:10:18.925
are you getting more funding
and more support,

00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:20.362
or it's still the same?

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:22.185
AG: We are getting more support.

00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:26.642
I would say that we are coming
close to the levels of last year.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.449
We were much worse during the summer.

00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:33.657
But that is clearly insufficient
to address the needs of the people

00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:35.571
and address the needs of the countries

00:10:35.595 --> 00:10:37.094
that are supporting the people.

00:10:37.118 --> 00:10:43.044
And here we have a basic review
of the criteria, the objectives,

00:10:43.068 --> 00:10:45.860
the priorities of development
cooperation that is required.

00:10:45.884 --> 00:10:48.887
For instance, Lebanon and Jordan
are middle-income countries.

00:10:48.911 --> 00:10:50.885
Because they are middle-income countries,

00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:53.820
they cannot receive soft loans
or grants from the World Bank.

00:10:53.844 --> 00:10:56.043
Now, today this doesn't make any sense,

00:10:56.067 --> 00:10:58.396
because they are providing
a global public good.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.230
They have millions of refugees there,

00:11:00.254 --> 00:11:03.744
and to be honest, they are pillars
of stability in the region,

00:11:03.768 --> 00:11:05.506
with all the difficulties they face,

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.220
and the first line of defense
of our collective security.

00:11:08.244 --> 00:11:09.407
So it doesn't make sense

00:11:09.431 --> 00:11:11.574
that these countries
are not a first priority

00:11:11.598 --> 00:11:13.343
in development cooperation policies.

00:11:13.367 --> 00:11:14.526
And they are not.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.952
And not only do the refugees live
in very dramatic circumstances

00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:19.206
inside those countries,

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.056
but the local communities
themselves are suffering,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.336
because salaries went down,

00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:27.138
because there are more unemployed,

00:11:27.162 --> 00:11:29.562
because prices and rents went up.

00:11:30.238 --> 00:11:34.182
And, of course, if you look
at today's situation

00:11:34.206 --> 00:11:37.304
of the indicators in these countries,

00:11:37.328 --> 00:11:42.811
it is clear that, especially
their poor groups of the population,

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:46.070
are living worse and worse
because of the crisis they are facing.

00:11:46.094 --> 00:11:48.078
BG: Who should be providing this support?

00:11:48.102 --> 00:11:51.423
Country by country, international
organizations, the European Union?

00:11:51.447 --> 00:11:53.495
Who should be coming up with this support?

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:55.064
AG: We need to join all efforts.

00:11:55.088 --> 00:11:57.633
It's clear that bilateral
cooperation is essential.

00:11:57.657 --> 00:12:00.420
It's clear that multilateral
cooperation is essential.

00:12:00.444 --> 00:12:04.039
It's clear that international financial
institutions should have flexibility

00:12:04.063 --> 00:12:06.782
in order to be able to invest
more massively

00:12:06.806 --> 00:12:08.332
in support to these countries.

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:11.602
We need to combine all the instruments
and to understand that today,

00:12:11.626 --> 00:12:14.072
in protracted situations,
at a certain moment,

00:12:14.096 --> 00:12:16.766
that it doesn't make sense anymore
to make a distinction

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.439
between humanitarian aid
and development aid

00:12:20.463 --> 00:12:22.812
or development processes.

00:12:22.836 --> 00:12:26.439
Because you are talking
about children in school,

00:12:26.463 --> 00:12:27.872
you are talking about health,

00:12:27.896 --> 00:12:30.728
you are talking about infrastructure
that is overcrowded.

00:12:30.752 --> 00:12:34.321
You are talking about things
that require a long-term perspective,

00:12:34.345 --> 00:12:35.678
a development perspective

00:12:35.702 --> 00:12:38.738
and not only an emergency
humanitarian aid perspective.

00:12:39.147 --> 00:12:41.171
BG: I would like your comment on something

00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:42.948
that was in newspapers this morning.

00:12:42.972 --> 00:12:48.344
It is a statement made
by the current front-runner

00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:51.714
for the Republican nomination
for US President, Donald Trump.

00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:53.104
Yesterday, he said this.

00:12:53.128 --> 00:12:54.129
(Laughter)

00:12:54.153 --> 00:12:55.945
No, listen to this. It's interesting.

00:12:55.969 --> 00:12:58.839
I quote: "I am calling for a total
and complete shutdown

00:12:58.863 --> 00:13:00.561
of Muslims entering the US,

00:13:00.585 --> 00:13:04.901
until our country's representatives
can figure out what's going on."

00:13:05.425 --> 00:13:06.784
How do you react to that?

00:13:06.808 --> 00:13:08.892
AG: Well, it's not only Donald Trump.

00:13:08.916 --> 00:13:11.182
We have seen several people
around the world

00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:13.619
with political responsibility
saying, for instance,

00:13:13.643 --> 00:13:15.801
that Muslims refugees
should not be received.

00:13:16.108 --> 00:13:19.608
And the reason why they say this

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.731
is because they think
that by doing or saying this,

00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:25.337
they are protecting
the security of their countries.

00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:26.794
Now, I've been in government.

00:13:26.818 --> 00:13:29.096
I am very keen on the need for governments

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.565
to protect the security of their countries

00:13:31.589 --> 00:13:32.740
and their people.

00:13:32.764 --> 00:13:35.687
But if you say, like that,

00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:38.217
in the US or in any European country,

00:13:38.241 --> 00:13:42.187
"We are going to close our doors
to Muslim refugees,"

00:13:42.211 --> 00:13:45.323
what you are saying
is the best possible help

00:13:45.347 --> 00:13:47.757
for the propaganda
of terrorist organizations.

00:13:48.146 --> 00:13:49.758
Because what you are saying --

00:13:49.782 --> 00:13:55.357
(Applause)

00:13:55.381 --> 00:14:00.964
What you are saying will be heard
by all the Muslims in your own country,

00:14:00.988 --> 00:14:03.061
and it will pave the way
for the recruitment

00:14:03.085 --> 00:14:05.706
and the mechanisms that,
through technology,

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.585
Daesh and al-Nusra, al-Qaeda,
and all those other groups

00:14:09.609 --> 00:14:12.007
are today penetrating in our societies.

00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:16.152
And it's just telling them,
"You are right, we are against you."

00:14:16.176 --> 00:14:22.566
So obviously, this is creating
in societies that are all multiethnic,

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.339
multi-religious, multicultural,

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:27.735
this is creating a situation
in which, really,

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:31.149
it is much easier for the propaganda
of these terrorist organizations

00:14:31.173 --> 00:14:36.286
to be effective in recruiting
people for terror acts

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:40.224
within the countries where these kinds
of sentences are expressed.

00:14:40.248 --> 00:14:43.231
BG: Have the recent attacks in Paris
and the reactions to them

00:14:43.255 --> 00:14:45.238
made your job more difficult?

00:14:45.262 --> 00:14:46.621
AG: Undoubtedly.

00:14:46.645 --> 00:14:48.106
BG: In what sense?

00:14:48.992 --> 00:14:53.308
AG: In the sense that, I mean,
for many people the first reaction

00:14:53.332 --> 00:14:56.752
in relation to these kinds of terrorist
attacks is: close all borders --

00:14:56.776 --> 00:15:01.221
not understanding that the terrorist
problem in Europe is largely homegrown.

00:15:01.245 --> 00:15:06.218
We have thousands and thousands
of European fighters in Syria and in Iraq,

00:15:06.242 --> 00:15:10.472
so this is not something that you solve
by just not allowing Syrians to come in.

00:15:10.496 --> 00:15:12.952
And I must say, I am convinced

00:15:12.976 --> 00:15:17.148
that the passport that appeared,

00:15:17.172 --> 00:15:20.919
I believe, was put
by the person who has blown --

00:15:20.943 --> 00:15:22.474
BG: -- himself up, yeah.

00:15:22.498 --> 00:15:24.409
AG: [I believe] it was on purpose,

00:15:24.433 --> 00:15:28.051
because part of the strategies
of Daesh is against refugees,

00:15:28.075 --> 00:15:31.488
because they see refugees as people
that should be with the caliphate

00:15:31.512 --> 00:15:33.964
and are fleeing to the crusaders.

00:15:33.988 --> 00:15:38.051
And I think that is part of Daesh's
strategy to make Europe react,

00:15:38.075 --> 00:15:40.466
closing its doors to Muslim refugees

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.181
and having an hostility
towards Muslims inside Europe,

00:15:44.205 --> 00:15:47.727
exactly to facilitate Daesh's work.

00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:52.259
And my deep belief is that
it was not the refugee movement

00:15:52.283 --> 00:15:53.964
that triggered terrorism.

00:15:53.988 --> 00:15:55.148
I think, as I said,

00:15:55.172 --> 00:15:58.699
essentially terrorism in Europe
is today a homegrown movement

00:15:58.723 --> 00:16:02.018
in relation to the global situation
that we are facing,

00:16:02.042 --> 00:16:06.462
and what we need is exactly
to prove these groups wrong,

00:16:06.486 --> 00:16:09.959
by welcoming and integrating effectively

00:16:09.983 --> 00:16:12.386
those that are coming
from that part of the world.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.426
And another thing that I believe
is that to a large extent,

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.913
what we are today paying for in Europe

00:16:17.937 --> 00:16:20.107
is the failures of integration models

00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:23.272
that didn't work in the '60s,
in the '70s, in the '80s,

00:16:23.296 --> 00:16:26.267
in relation to big migration flows
that took place at that time

00:16:26.291 --> 00:16:30.080
and generated what is today
in many of the people, for instance,

00:16:30.104 --> 00:16:32.847
of the second generation of communities,

00:16:32.871 --> 00:16:37.002
a situation of feeling marginalized,

00:16:37.026 --> 00:16:38.416
having no jobs,

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.979
having improper education,

00:16:40.003 --> 00:16:45.228
living in some of the neighborhoods
that are not adequately provided

00:16:45.252 --> 00:16:47.494
by public infrastructure.

00:16:47.518 --> 00:16:52.351
And this kind of uneasiness,
sometimes even anger,

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:54.844
that exists in this second generation

00:16:54.868 --> 00:16:57.891
is largely due to the failure
of integration policies,

00:16:57.915 --> 00:17:01.796
to the failure of what should have been
a much stronger investment

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.208
in creating the conditions for people
to live together and respect each other.

00:17:06.232 --> 00:17:07.540
For me it is clear.

00:17:07.564 --> 00:17:10.805
(Applause)

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:14.699
For me it is clear that all societies
will be multiethnic, multicultural,

00:17:14.723 --> 00:17:16.349
multi-religious in the future.

00:17:16.666 --> 00:17:19.904
To try to avoid it is,
in my opinion, impossible.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.320
And for me it's a good thing
that they will be like that,

00:17:23.344 --> 00:17:26.722
but I also recognize that,
for that to work properly,

00:17:26.746 --> 00:17:28.702
you need a huge investment

00:17:28.726 --> 00:17:31.162
in the social cohesion
of your own societies.

00:17:31.186 --> 00:17:34.860
And Europe, to a large extent,
failed in that investment

00:17:34.884 --> 00:17:38.097
in the past few decades.

00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:42.117
BG: Question: You are stepping down
from your job at the end of the year,

00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:43.674
after 10 years.

00:17:43.698 --> 00:17:45.135
If you look back at 2005,

00:17:45.159 --> 00:17:48.234
when you entered that office
for the first time, what do you see?

00:17:49.491 --> 00:17:51.346
AG: Well, look:

00:17:52.466 --> 00:17:57.843
In 2005, we were helping
one million people go back home

00:17:57.867 --> 00:18:00.915
in safety and dignity,
because conflicts had ended.

00:18:01.692 --> 00:18:04.357
Last year, we helped 124,000.

00:18:05.659 --> 00:18:10.747
In 2005, we had about 38 million people
displaced by conflict in the world.

00:18:10.771 --> 00:18:13.242
Today, we have more than 60 million.

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:17.119
At that time, we had had, recently,

00:18:17.143 --> 00:18:19.822
some conflicts that were solved.

00:18:20.393 --> 00:18:22.700
Now, we see a multiplication
of new conflicts

00:18:22.724 --> 00:18:24.565
and the old conflicts never died:

00:18:24.589 --> 00:18:27.945
Afghanistan, Somalia,
Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:18:27.969 --> 00:18:32.025
It is clear that the world today
is much more dangerous than it was.

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:34.893
It is clear that the capacity
of the international community

00:18:34.917 --> 00:18:37.793
to prevent conflicts
and to timely solve them,

00:18:37.817 --> 00:18:41.971
is, unfortunately, much worse
than what it was 10 years ago.

00:18:41.995 --> 00:18:44.740
There are no clear
power relations in the world,

00:18:44.764 --> 00:18:47.257
no global governance mechanisms that work,

00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:50.060
which means that we live in a situation

00:18:50.084 --> 00:18:55.010
where impunity and unpredictability
tend to prevail, and that means

00:18:55.034 --> 00:18:57.449
that more and more people suffer,

00:18:57.473 --> 00:18:59.866
namely those that are
displaced by conflicts.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.896
BG: It's a tradition in American politics

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.550
that when a President leaves
the Oval Office for the last time,

00:19:05.574 --> 00:19:08.351
he leaves a handwritten note
on the desk for his successor

00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:10.476
that walks in a couple of hours later.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.685
If you had to write such a note
to your successor, Filippo Grandi,

00:19:13.709 --> 00:19:14.861
what would you write?

00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:17.949
AG: Well, I don't think
I would write any message.

00:19:17.973 --> 00:19:20.948
You know, one of the terrible things
when one leaves an office

00:19:20.972 --> 00:19:23.702
is to try to become the backseat driver,

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:26.613
always telling the new one what to do.

00:19:26.637 --> 00:19:28.153
So that, I will not do.

00:19:28.177 --> 00:19:30.121
If I had to say something to him,

00:19:30.145 --> 00:19:32.422
it would be, "Be yourself,
and do your best."

00:19:32.753 --> 00:19:34.999
BG: Commissioner, thank you
for the job you do.

00:19:35.023 --> 00:19:36.528
Thank you for coming to TED.

00:19:36.552 --> 00:19:40.894
(Applause)
