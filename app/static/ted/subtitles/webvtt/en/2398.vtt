00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.936
In 2008, Burhan Hassan, age 17,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.896
boarded a flight from Minneapolis

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.216
to the Horn of Africa.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.656
And while Burhan was the youngest recruit,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.336
he was not alone.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.736
Al-Shabaab managed to recruit
over two dozen young men

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.336
in their late teens and early 20s

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.376
with a heavy presence
on social media platforms like Facebook.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.656
With the Internet and other technologies,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.376
they've changed our everyday lives,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.216
but they've also changed
recruitment, radicalization

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.960
and the front lines of conflict today.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.136
What about the links connecting Twitter,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.096
Google and protesters
fighting for democracy?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.136
These numbers represent
Google's public DNS servers,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.696
effectively the only
digital border crossing

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.776
protesters had and could use

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.616
to communicate with each other,
to reach the outside world

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.256
and to spread viral awareness

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.560
of what was happening
in their own country.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.376
Today, conflict is essentially borderless.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.056
If there are bounds to conflict today,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.976
they're bound by digital,
not physical geography.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.056
And under all this is a vacuum of power

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.136
where non-state actors, individuals
and private organizations

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.400
have the advantage over slow, outdated
military and intelligence agencies.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.016
And this is because,
in the digital age of conflict,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.296
there exists a feedback loop

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.176
where new technologies,
platforms like the ones I mentioned,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.656
and more disruptive ones,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.456
can be adapted, learned, and deployed
by individuals and organizations

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.000
faster than governments can react.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.936
To understand the pace
of our own government thinking on this,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.936
I like to turn to something aptly named

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.096
the Worldwide Threat Assessment,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.816
where every year the Director
of National Intelligence in the US

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.656
looks at the global threat landscape,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.936
and he says, "These are the threats,
these are the details,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.016
and this is how we rank them."

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.456
In 2007, there was absolutely
no mention of cyber security.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.175
It took until 2011,
when it came at the end,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.096
where other things, like West
African drug trafficking, took precedence.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.616
In 2012, it crept up, still behind things
like terrorism and proliferation.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.736
In 2013, it became the top threat,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.240
in 2014 and for the foreseeable future.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.896
What things like that show us

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.896
is that there is
a fundamental inability today

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.560
on the part of governments
to adapt and learn in digital conflict,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.680
where conflict can be immaterial,
borderless, often wholly untraceable.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.176
And conflict isn't just online to offline,
as we see with terrorist radicalization,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.280
but it goes the other way as well.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.056
We all know the horrible events
that unfolded in Paris this year

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.033
with the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.

00:02:53.057 --> 00:02:57.536
What an individual hacker or a small group
of anonymous individuals did

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.176
was enter those social media conversations
that so many of us took part in.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.336
#JeSuisCharlie.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.576
On Facebook, on Twitter, on Google,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.056
all sorts of places where millions
of people, myself included,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.696
were talking about the events

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.176
and saw images like this,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.336
the emotional, poignant image of a baby
with "Je suis Charlie" on its wrist.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.456
And this turned into a weapon.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.816
What the hackers did
was weaponize this image,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.496
where unsuspecting victims,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.416
like all of us in those conversations,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.056
saw this image, downloaded it

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.216
but it was embedded with malware.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.216
And so when you downloaded this image,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.296
it hacked your system.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.360
It took six days to deploy
a global malware campaign.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.136
The divide between physical
and digital domains today

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.576
ceases to exist,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.536
where we have offline attacks
like those in Paris

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.800
appropriated for online hacks.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.776
And it goes the other way as well,
with recruitment.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.256
We see online radicalization of teens,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.560
who can then be deployed globally
for offline terrorist attacks.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.336
With all of this, we see that there's
a new 21st century battle brewing,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.520
and governments
don't necessarily take a part.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.896
So in another case,
Anonymous vs. Los Zetas.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.456
In early September 2011 in Mexico,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.536
Los Zetas, one of the most
powerful drug cartels,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.896
hung two bloggers with a sign that said,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.600
"This is what will happen
to all Internet busybodies."

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.696
A week later, they beheaded a young girl.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.176
They severed her head,
put it on top of her computer

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.416
with a similar note.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.296
And taking the digital counteroffensive

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.606
because governments couldn't even
understand what was going on or act,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.526
Anonymous, a group we might not associate
as the most positive force in the world,

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.736
took action,

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.360
not in cyber attacks, but threatening
information to be free.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.616
On social media, they said,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.296
"We will release information

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.640
that ties prosecutors and governors
to corrupt drug deals with the cartel."

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.176
And escalating that conflict,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.000
Los Zetas said, "We will kill 10 people
for every bit of information you release."

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.520
And so it ended there because
it would become too gruesome to continue.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.600
But what was powerful about this

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.216
was that anonymous individuals,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.856
not federal policia,
not military, not politicians,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.056
could strike fear deep into the heart

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.480
of one of the most powerful,
violent organizations in the world.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.496
And so we live in an era

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.056
that lacks the clarity
of the past in conflict,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.896
in who we're fighting,
in the motivations behind attacks,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.776
in the tools and techniques used,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.440
and how quickly they evolve.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.216
And the question still remains:

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.776
what can individuals,
organizations and governments do?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.616
For answers to these questions,
it starts with individuals,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.400
and I think peer-to-peer security
is the answer.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.736
Those people in relationships
that bought over teens online,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.816
we can do that with peer-to-peer security.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.376
Individuals have more power
than ever before

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.320
to affect national
and international security.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.616
And we can create those positive
peer-to-peer relationships

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.840
on and offline,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.056
we can support and educate the next
generation of hackers, like myself,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.640
instead of saying, "You can either be
a criminal or join the NSA."

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.720
That matters today.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.136
And it's not just individuals --
it's organizations, corporations even.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.696
They have an advantage
to act across more borders,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.256
more effectively and more rapidly
than governments can,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.160
and there's a set
of real incentives there.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.136
It's profitable and valuable

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.656
to be seen as trustworthy
in the digital age,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.656
and will only be more so
in future generations to come.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.496
But we still can't ignore government,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.856
because that's who we turn to
for collective action

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.640
to keep us safe and secure.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.096
But we see where that's gotten us so far,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.856
where there's an inability to adapt
and learn in digital conflict,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.936
where at the highest levels of leadership,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.336
the Director of the CIA,
Secretary of Defense,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.800
they say, "Cyber Pearl Harbor will happen."
"Cyber 9/11 is imminent."

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.080
But this only makes us
more fearful, not more secure.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.936
By banning encryption in favor
of mass surveillance and mass hacking,

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.680
sure, GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.595
But that doesn't mean
that they're the only ones that can.

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:39.776
Capabilities are cheap, even free.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.416
Technical ability
is rising around the world,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.960
and individuals and small groups
have the advantage.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.456
So today it might just be
the NSA and GCHQ,

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.242
but who's to say that the Chinese
can't find that backdoor?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.240
Or in another generation,
some kid in his basement in Estonia?

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.656
And so I would say that it's
not what governments can do,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.960
it's that they can't.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.216
Governments today
need to give up power and control

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.520
in order to help make us more secure.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.696
Giving up mass surveillance and hacking
and instead fixing those backdoors

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.976
means that, yeah, they can't spy on us,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.336
but neither can the Chinese

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.720
or that hacker in Estonia
a generation from now.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.736
And government support
for technologies like Tor and Bitcoin

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.336
mean giving up control,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.655
but it means that developers, translators,
anybody with an Internet connection,

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:38.775
in countries like Cuba, Iran and China,
can sell their skills, their products,

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.176
in the global marketplace,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.416
but more importantly sell their ideas,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.120
show us what's happening
in their own countries.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.376
And so it should be not fearful,

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.816
it should be inspiring
to the same governments

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.696
that fought for civil rights,
free speech and democracy

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.736
in the great wars of the last century,

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.816
that today, for the first time
in human history,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.056
we have a technical opportunity

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.696
to make billions of people
safer around the world

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.256
that we've never had before
in human history.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.360
It should be inspiring.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:15.240
(Applause)
