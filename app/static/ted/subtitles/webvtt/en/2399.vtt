WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.735
What keeps us healthy and happy

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.320
as we go through life?

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.016
If you were going to invest now

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.096
in your future best self,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.080
where would you put your time
and your energy?

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.536
There was a recent survey of millennials

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.736
asking them what their
most important life goals were,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.776
and over 80 percent said

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.936
that a major life goal for them
was to get rich.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.296
And another 50 percent
of those same young adults

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.856
said that another major life goal

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.720
was to become famous.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.176
(Laughter)

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.856
And we're constantly told
to lean in to work, to push harder

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.936
and achieve more.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.616
We're given the impression that these
are the things that we need to go after

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.456
in order to have a good life.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.696
Pictures of entire lives,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.936
of the choices that people make
and how those choices work out for them,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.840
those pictures
are almost impossible to get.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.136
Most of what we know about human life

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.616
we know from asking people
to remember the past,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.416
and as we know, hindsight
is anything but 20/20.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.136
We forget vast amounts
of what happens to us in life,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.040
and sometimes memory
is downright creative.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.176
But what if we could watch entire lives

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.056
as they unfold through time?

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.056
What if we could study people
from the time that they were teenagers

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.816
all the way into old age

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.200
to see what really keeps people
happy and healthy?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.760
We did that.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.856
The Harvard Study of Adult Development

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.640
may be the longest study
of adult life that's ever been done.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.840
For 75 years, we've tracked
the lives of 724 men,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.856
year after year, asking about their work,
their home lives, their health,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.256
and of course asking all along the way
without knowing how their life stories

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.720
were going to turn out.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.896
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.976
Almost all projects of this kind
fall apart within a decade

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.176
because too many people
drop out of the study,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.096
or funding for the research dries up,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.376
or the researchers get distracted,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.480
or they die, and nobody moves the ball
further down the field.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.536
But through a combination of luck

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.256
and the persistence
of several generations of researchers,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.840
this study has survived.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.016
About 60 of our original 724 men

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.336
are still alive,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.536
still participating in the study,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.600
most of them in their 90s.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.456
And we are now beginning to study

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.840
the more than 2,000 children of these men.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.000
And I'm the fourth director of the study.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.136
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives
of two groups of men.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.296
The first group started in the study

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.016
when they were sophomores
at Harvard College.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.856
They all finished college
during World War II,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.320
and then most went off
to serve in the war.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.416
And the second group that we've followed

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.616
was a group of boys
from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.656
boys who were chosen for the study

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.016
specifically because they were
from some of the most troubled

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.896
and disadvantaged families

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.656
in the Boston of the 1930s.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.280
Most lived in tenements,
many without hot and cold running water.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.416
When they entered the study,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.376
all of these teenagers were interviewed.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.616
They were given medical exams.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.176
We went to their homes
and we interviewed their parents.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.576
And then these teenagers
grew up into adults

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.016
who entered all walks of life.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.136
They became factory workers and lawyers
and bricklayers and doctors,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.520
one President of the United States.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.400
Some developed alcoholism.
A few developed schizophrenia.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.616
Some climbed the social ladder

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.856
from the bottom
all the way to the very top,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.160
and some made that journey
in the opposite direction.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.456
The founders of this study

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.496
would never in their wildest dreams

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.056
have imagined that I would be
standing here today, 75 years later,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.160
telling you that
the study still continues.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.896
Every two years, our patient
and dedicated research staff

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.976
calls up our men
and asks them if we can send them

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.120
yet one more set of questions
about their lives.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.616
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.520
"Why do you keep wanting to study me?
My life just isn't that interesting."

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.976
The Harvard men never ask that question.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.200
(Laughter)

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.776
To get the clearest picture
of these lives,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.736
we don't just send them questionnaires.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.216
We interview them in their living rooms.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.176
We get their medical records
from their doctors.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.696
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.416
we talk to their children.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.696
We videotape them talking with their wives
about their deepest concerns.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.256
And when, about a decade ago,
we finally asked the wives

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.656
if they would join us
as members of the study,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.376
many of the women said,
"You know, it's about time."

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.456
(Laughter)

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.176
So what have we learned?

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.416
What are the lessons that come
from the tens of thousands of pages

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.496
of information that we've generated

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.720
on these lives?

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.320
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth
or fame or working harder and harder.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.816
The clearest message that we get
from this 75-year study is this:

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.040
Good relationships keep us
happier and healthier. Period.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.816
We've learned three big lessons
about relationships.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.936
The first is that social connections
are really good for us,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.456
and that loneliness kills.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.136
It turns out that people
who are more socially connected

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.256
to family, to friends, to community,

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.976
are happier, they're physically healthier,
and they live longer

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.376
than people who are less well connected.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.816
And the experience of loneliness
turns out to be toxic.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.976
People who are more isolated
than they want to be from others

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.216
find that they are less happy,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.176
their health declines earlier in midlife,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.416
their brain functioning declines sooner

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.000
and they live shorter lives
than people who are not lonely.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.256
And the sad fact
is that at any given time,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.880
more than one in five Americans
will report that they're lonely.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.696
And we know that you
can be lonely in a crowd

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.376
and you can be lonely in a marriage,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.536
so the second big lesson that we learned

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.656
is that it's not just
the number of friends you have,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.176
and it's not whether or not
you're in a committed relationship,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.840
but it's the quality
of your close relationships that matters.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.336
It turns out that living in the midst
of conflict is really bad for our health.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.336
High-conflict marriages, for example,
without much affection,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:41.136
turn out to be very bad for our health,
perhaps worse than getting divorced.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.936
And living in the midst of good,
warm relationships is protective.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.056
Once we had followed our men
all the way into their 80s,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.096
we wanted to look back at them at midlife

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.696
and to see if we could predict

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.696
who was going to grow
into a happy, healthy octogenarian

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.920
and who wasn't.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.896
And when we gathered together
everything we knew about them

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.280
at age 50,

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.616
it wasn't their middle age
cholesterol levels

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.536
that predicted how they
were going to grow old.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.016
It was how satisfied they were
in their relationships.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.936
The people who were the most satisfied
in their relationships at age 50

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.360
were the healthiest at age 80.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.856
And good, close relationships
seem to buffer us

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.640
from some of the slings and arrows
of getting old.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.456
Our most happily partnered men and women

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.535
reported, in their 80s,

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.496
that on the days
when they had more physical pain,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.480
their mood stayed just as happy.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.656
But the people who were
in unhappy relationships,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.616
on the days when they
reported more physical pain,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.680
it was magnified by more emotional pain.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.736
And the third big lesson that we learned
about relationships and our health

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.016
is that good relationships
don't just protect our bodies,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.520
they protect our brains.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.096
It turns out that being
in a securely attached relationship

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.016
to another person in your 80s
is protective,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.016
that the people who are in relationships

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.176
where they really feel they can count
on the other person in times of need,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.896
those people's memories
stay sharper longer.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.416
And the people in relationships

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.576
where they feel they really
can't count on the other one,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.480
those are the people who experience
earlier memory decline.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.976
And those good relationships,
they don't have to be smooth all the time.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.576
Some of our octogenarian couples
could bicker with each other

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.336
day in and day out,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.536
but as long as they felt that they
could really count on the other

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.376
when the going got tough,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.000
those arguments didn't take a toll
on their memories.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.336
So this message,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:58.056
that good, close relationships
are good for our health and well-being,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.016
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.880
Why is this so hard to get
and so easy to ignore?

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.016
Well, we're human.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.856
What we'd really like is a quick fix,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.576
something we can get

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.360
that'll make our lives good
and keep them that way.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.656
Relationships are messy
and they're complicated

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.496
and the hard work of tending
to family and friends,

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.176
it's not sexy or glamorous.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.536
It's also lifelong. It never ends.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.616
The people in our 75-year study
who were the happiest in retirement

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:39.456
were the people who had actively worked
to replace workmates with new playmates.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.456
Just like the millennials
in that recent survey,

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.096
many of our men when they
were starting out as young adults

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.136
really believed that fame and wealth
and high achievement

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.096
were what they needed to go after
to have a good life.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.296
But over and over, over these 75 years,
our study has shown

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.976
that the people who fared the best were
the people who leaned in to relationships,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.240
with family, with friends, with community.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.056
So what about you?

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.840
Let's say you're 25,
or you're 40, or you're 60.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.760
What might leaning in
to relationships even look like?

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.880
Well, the possibilities
are practically endless.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.696
It might be something as simple
as replacing screen time with people time

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.176
or livening up a stale relationship
by doing something new together,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.400
long walks or date nights,

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.216
or reaching out to that family member
who you haven't spoken to in years,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.736
because those all-too-common family feuds

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.976
take a terrible toll

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.080
on the people who hold the grudges.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.920
I'd like to close with a quote
from Mark Twain.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.656
More than a century ago,

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.296
he was looking back on his life,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.600
and he wrote this:

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.536
"There isn't time, so brief is life,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.720
for bickerings, apologies,
heartburnings, callings to account.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.536
There is only time for loving,

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.280
and but an instant,
so to speak, for that."

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.136
The good life is built
with good relationships.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.376
Thank you.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.840
(Applause)
