00:00:01.142 --> 00:00:02.316
I once said,

00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:05.483
"If you want to liberate a society,

00:00:05.507 --> 00:00:07.523
all you need is the Internet."

00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:09.415
I was wrong.

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:12.701
I said those words back in 2011,

00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:15.647
when a Facebook page I anonymously created

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.986
helped spark the Egyptian revolution.

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:23.304
The Arab Spring revealed
social media's greatest potential,

00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:27.336
but it also exposed
its greatest shortcomings.

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:32.023
The same tool that united us
to topple dictators

00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:35.229
eventually tore us apart.

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:41.124
I would like to share my own experience
in using social media for activism,

00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:44.679
and talk about some of the challenges
I have personally faced

00:00:44.703 --> 00:00:46.528
and what we could do about them.

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:49.580
In the early 2000s,

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:52.219
Arabs were flooding the web.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.580
Thirsty for knowledge, for opportunities,

00:00:56.604 --> 00:01:00.316
for connecting with the rest
of the people around the globe,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.027
we escaped our frustrating
political realities

00:01:04.735 --> 00:01:08.699
and lived a virtual, alternative life.

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:14.026
Just like many of them,
I was completely apolitical until 2009.

00:01:14.835 --> 00:01:18.344
At the time, when I logged
into social media,

00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:20.888
I started seeing more and more Egyptians

00:01:20.912 --> 00:01:23.657
aspiring for political change
in the country.

00:01:24.244 --> 00:01:26.894
It felt like I was not alone.

00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:30.284
In June 2010,

00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:33.712
Internet changed my life forever.

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:37.532
While browsing Facebook,

00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:42.815
I saw a photo, a terrifying photo,
of a tortured, dead body

00:01:43.493 --> 00:01:45.373
of a young Egyptian guy.

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:48.016
His name was Khaled Said.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.361
Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian
who was killed by police.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.012
I saw myself in his picture.

00:01:57.924 --> 00:02:00.004
I thought, "I could be Khaled."

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:04.923
I could not sleep that night,
and I decided to do something.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:08.043
I anonymously created a Facebook page

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:11.407
and called it "We are all Khaled Said."

00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:17.270
In just three days, the page
had over 100,000 people,

00:02:17.294 --> 00:02:20.898
fellow Egyptians who shared
the same concern.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.790
Whatever was happening had to stop.

00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:27.401
I recruited my co-admin,
AbdelRahman Mansour.

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:30.932
We worked together for hours and hours.

00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:33.884
We were crowdsourcing
ideas from the people.

00:02:33.908 --> 00:02:35.352
We were engaging them.

00:02:35.376 --> 00:02:37.940
We were calling collectively for actions,

00:02:37.964 --> 00:02:41.860
and sharing news that the regime
did not want Egyptians to know.

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:45.697
The page became the most followed page

00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:47.124
in the Arab world.

00:02:47.148 --> 00:02:51.502
It had more fans than established
media organizations

00:02:51.526 --> 00:02:53.301
and even top celebrities.

00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:56.936
On January 14, 2011,

00:02:57.555 --> 00:03:00.088
Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:02.866
after mounting protests
against his regime.

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:05.462
I saw a spark of hope.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:09.326
Egyptians on social media were wondering,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.691
"If Tunisia did it, why can't we?"

00:03:12.715 --> 00:03:14.907
I posted an event
on Facebook and called it

00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:19.738
"A Revolution against Corruption,
Injustice and Dictatorship."

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:25.142
I posed a question to the 300,000 users
of the page at the time:

00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:28.301
"Today is the 14th of January.

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.220
The 25th of January is Police Day.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.259
It's a national holiday.

00:03:34.283 --> 00:03:38.227
If 100,000 of us take
to the streets of Cairo,

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:40.006
no one is going to stop us.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.802
I wonder if we could do it."

00:03:42.797 --> 00:03:47.279
In just a few days, the invitation
reached over a million people,

00:03:47.303 --> 00:03:51.033
and over 100,000 people
confirmed attendance.

00:03:51.562 --> 00:03:53.903
Social media was crucial
for this campaign.

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.531
It helped a decentralized movement arise.

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.499
It made people realize
that they were not alone.

00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:03.753
And it made it impossible
for the regime to stop it.

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.050
At the time, they didn't
even understand it.

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:13.889
And on January 25th, Egyptians flooded
the streets of Cairo and other cities,

00:04:13.913 --> 00:04:15.887
calling for change,

00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:18.206
breaking the barrier of fear

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.129
and announcing a new era.

00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:23.552
Then came the consequences.

00:04:24.592 --> 00:04:29.371
A few hours before the regime cut off
the Internet and telecommunications,

00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:33.343
I was walking in a dark street
in Cairo, around midnight.

00:04:34.075 --> 00:04:37.034
I had just tweeted, "Pray for Egypt.

00:04:37.423 --> 00:04:40.529
The government must be planning
a massacre tomorrow."

00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:43.835
I was hit hard on my head.

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:46.699
I lost my balance and fell down,

00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:50.223
to find four armed men surrounding me.

00:04:50.698 --> 00:04:53.918
One covered my mouth
and the others paralyzed me.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.796
I knew I was being kidnapped
by state security.

00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:00.930
I found myself in a cell,

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.389
handcuffed, blindfolded.

00:05:05.027 --> 00:05:06.251
I was terrified.

00:05:06.615 --> 00:05:07.939
So was my family,

00:05:08.956 --> 00:05:10.581
who started looking for me

00:05:10.605 --> 00:05:13.512
in hospitals, police stations
and even morgues.

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:15.840
After my disappearance,

00:05:15.864 --> 00:05:19.253
a few of my fellow colleagues who knew
I was the admin of the page

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:23.476
told the media about
my connection with that page,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.422
and that I was likely arrested
by state security.

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:31.572
My colleagues at Google started
a search campaign trying to find me,

00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:35.578
and the fellow protesters in the square
demanded my release.

00:05:36.088 --> 00:05:38.540
After 11 days of complete darkness,

00:05:38.564 --> 00:05:39.784
I was set free.

00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:42.128
And three days later,

00:05:42.152 --> 00:05:44.714
Mubarak was forced to step down.

00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:49.649
It was the most inspiring
and empowering moment of my life.

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:52.225
It was a time of great hope.

00:05:53.265 --> 00:05:56.914
Egyptians lived a utopia for 18 days
during the revolution.

00:05:57.685 --> 00:05:59.557
They all shared the belief

00:05:59.581 --> 00:06:03.873
that we could actually live together
despite our differences,

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:06.353
that Egypt after Mubarak would be for all.

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:08.514
But unfortunately,

00:06:08.538 --> 00:06:12.973
the post-revolution events
were like a punch in the gut.

00:06:14.609 --> 00:06:15.988
The euphoria faded,

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:18.663
we failed to build consensus,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.250
and the political struggle
led to intense polarization.

00:06:23.813 --> 00:06:26.602
Social media only amplified that state,

00:06:26.626 --> 00:06:30.295
by facilitating the spread
of misinformation, rumors,

00:06:30.803 --> 00:06:33.165
echo chambers and hate speech.

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:35.549
The environment was purely toxic.

00:06:36.265 --> 00:06:42.379
My online world became a battleground
filled with trolls, lies, hate speech.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.329
I started to worry
about the safety of my family.

00:06:47.655 --> 00:06:50.032
But of course, this wasn't just about me.

00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:55.515
The polarization reached its peak
between the two main powers --

00:06:56.093 --> 00:06:58.327
the army supporters and the Islamists.

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.394
People in the center, like me,

00:07:01.418 --> 00:07:03.118
started feeling helpless.

00:07:04.587 --> 00:07:07.087
Both groups wanted you to side with them;

00:07:07.111 --> 00:07:09.362
you were either with them or against them.

00:07:10.737 --> 00:07:12.639
And on the 3rd of July 2013,

00:07:12.663 --> 00:07:17.170
the army ousted Egypt's first
democratically elected president,

00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:21.765
after three days of popular protest
that demanded his resignation.

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:25.214
That day I made a very hard decision.

00:07:25.688 --> 00:07:29.535
I decided to go silent, completely silent.

00:07:30.106 --> 00:07:31.775
It was a moment of defeat.

00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:35.905
I stayed silent for more than two years,

00:07:35.929 --> 00:07:38.831
and I used the time to reflect
on everything that happened,

00:07:39.394 --> 00:07:41.881
trying to understand why did it happen.

00:07:42.773 --> 00:07:44.218
It became clear to me

00:07:44.242 --> 00:07:49.163
that while it's true that polarization
is primarily driven

00:07:49.187 --> 00:07:51.022
by our human behavior,

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:55.490
social media shapes this behavior
and magnifies its impact.

00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:59.406
Say you want to say something
that is not based on a fact,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.142
pick a fight or ignore
someone that you don't like.

00:08:02.914 --> 00:08:05.621
These are all natural human impulses,

00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:07.800
but because of technology,

00:08:07.824 --> 00:08:11.248
acting on these impulses
is only one click away.

00:08:12.562 --> 00:08:15.505
In my view, there are five
critical challenges

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:17.847
facing today's social media.

00:08:18.794 --> 00:08:21.892
First, we don't know
how to deal with rumors.

00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:25.219
Rumors that confirm people's biases

00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:29.320
are now believed and spread
among millions of people.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.040
Second, we create our own echo chambers.

00:08:34.595 --> 00:08:37.912
We tend to only communicate
with people that we agree with,

00:08:37.936 --> 00:08:40.100
and thanks to social media,

00:08:40.124 --> 00:08:44.725
we can mute, un-follow
and block everybody else.

00:08:46.247 --> 00:08:51.067
Third, online discussions
quickly descend into angry mobs.

00:08:51.571 --> 00:08:53.258
All of us probably know that.

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:55.627
It's as if we forget

00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:58.911
that the people behind screens
are actually real people

00:08:58.935 --> 00:09:00.450
and not just avatars.

00:09:01.254 --> 00:09:05.636
And fourth, it became really hard
to change our opinions.

00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:09.593
Because of the speed
and brevity of social media,

00:09:09.617 --> 00:09:12.551
we are forced to jump to conclusions

00:09:12.575 --> 00:09:15.639
and write sharp opinions in 140 characters

00:09:15.663 --> 00:09:17.847
about complex world affairs.

00:09:18.402 --> 00:09:22.252
And once we do that,
it lives forever on the Internet,

00:09:22.276 --> 00:09:25.379
and we are less motivated
to change these views,

00:09:25.403 --> 00:09:27.434
even when new evidence arises.

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:31.590
Fifth -- and in my point of view,
this is the most critical --

00:09:32.246 --> 00:09:36.550
today, our social media experiences
are designed in a way

00:09:36.574 --> 00:09:39.511
that favors broadcasting over engagements,

00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:41.554
posts over discussions,

00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:45.258
shallow comments over deep conversations.

00:09:45.764 --> 00:09:49.814
It's as if we agreed that
we are here to talk at each other

00:09:49.838 --> 00:09:52.094
instead of talking with each other.

00:09:53.244 --> 00:09:55.680
I witnessed how these
critical challenges contributed

00:09:55.704 --> 00:09:59.017
to an already polarized
Egyptian society,

00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:01.154
but this is not just about Egypt.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.803
Polarization is on the rise
in the whole world.

00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:07.899
We need to work hard on figuring out

00:10:07.923 --> 00:10:11.244
how technology could be
part of the solution,

00:10:11.268 --> 00:10:13.278
rather than part of the problem.

00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:18.412
There's a lot of debate today
on how to combat online harassment

00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:19.658
and fight trolls.

00:10:19.992 --> 00:10:21.460
This is so important.

00:10:21.818 --> 00:10:23.671
No one could argue against that.

00:10:24.251 --> 00:10:29.468
But we need to also think about how
to design social media experiences

00:10:29.492 --> 00:10:32.671
that promote civility
and reward thoughtfulness.

00:10:33.512 --> 00:10:34.882
I know for a fact

00:10:34.906 --> 00:10:38.122
if I write a post
that is more sensational,

00:10:38.146 --> 00:10:41.657
more one-sided, sometimes
angry and aggressive,

00:10:41.681 --> 00:10:44.452
I get to have more people see that post.

00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:46.480
I will get more attention.

00:10:47.726 --> 00:10:49.990
But what if we put more focus on quality?

00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:52.374
What is more important:

00:10:52.398 --> 00:10:55.051
the total number of readers
of a post you write,

00:10:55.075 --> 00:10:59.696
or who are the people who have impact
that read what you write?

00:11:00.846 --> 00:11:05.212
Couldn't we just give people more
incentives to engage in conversations,

00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:07.903
rather than just broadcasting
opinions all the time?

00:11:08.788 --> 00:11:10.186
Or reward people for reading

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.566
and responding to views
that they disagree with?

00:11:14.082 --> 00:11:18.795
And also, make it socially acceptable
that we change our minds,

00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:20.511
or probably even reward that?

00:11:21.343 --> 00:11:25.492
What if we have a matrix that says
how many people changed their minds,

00:11:25.516 --> 00:11:28.672
and that becomes part
of our social media experience?

00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:32.283
If I could track how many people
are changing their minds,

00:11:32.307 --> 00:11:36.008
I'd probably write more
thoughtfully, trying to do that,

00:11:36.032 --> 00:11:39.737
rather than appealing to the people
who already agree with me

00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:42.322
and "liking" because I just
confirmed their biases.

00:11:43.512 --> 00:11:47.168
We also need to think about effective
crowdsourcing mechanisms,

00:11:47.192 --> 00:11:50.917
to fact-check widely spread
online information,

00:11:50.941 --> 00:11:53.231
and reward people who take part in that.

00:11:53.924 --> 00:11:58.861
In essence, we need to rethink
today's social media ecosystem

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:01.140
and redesign its experiences

00:12:01.164 --> 00:12:04.906
to reward thoughtfulness, civility
and mutual understanding.

00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:08.843
As a believer in the Internet,
I teamed up with a few friends,

00:12:08.867 --> 00:12:10.350
started a new project,

00:12:10.374 --> 00:12:14.179
trying to find answers
and explore possibilities.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.169
Our first product is a new
media platform for conversations.

00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:22.239
We're hosting conversations
that promote mutual understanding

00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:24.018
and hopefully change minds.

00:12:24.348 --> 00:12:26.144
We don't claim to have the answers,

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:30.144
but we started experimenting
with different discussions

00:12:30.168 --> 00:12:32.231
about very divisive issues,

00:12:32.255 --> 00:12:36.402
such as race, gun control,
the refugee debate,

00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:38.749
relationship between Islam and terrorism.

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:41.701
These are conversations that matter.

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:47.786
Today, at least one out of three
people on the planet

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.580
have access to the Internet.

00:12:50.226 --> 00:12:54.026
But part of this Internet
is being held captive

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.687
by the less noble aspects
of our human behavior.

00:12:58.774 --> 00:13:00.748
Five years ago, I said,

00:13:01.148 --> 00:13:03.769
"If you want to liberate society,

00:13:04.943 --> 00:13:06.555
all you need is the Internet."

00:13:07.207 --> 00:13:12.242
Today, I believe if we want
to liberate society,

00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:14.701
we first need to liberate the Internet.

00:13:15.193 --> 00:13:16.361
Thank you very much.

00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:21.043
