WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.376
Late in January 1975,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.816
a 17-year-old German girl
called Vera Brandes

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.480
walked out onto the stage
of the Cologne Opera House.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.320
The auditorium was empty.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.640
It was lit only by the dim, green glow
of the emergency exit sign.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.136
This was the most
exciting day of Vera's life.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.176
She was the youngest
concert promoter in Germany,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.616
and she had persuaded
the Cologne Opera House

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.976
to host a late-night concert of jazz

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.800
from the American musician, Keith Jarrett.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.816
1,400 people were coming.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.416
And in just a few hours,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.856
Jarrett would walk out on the same stage,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.216
he'd sit down at the piano

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.056
and without rehearsal or sheet music,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.360
he would begin to play.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.536
But right now,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.136
Vera was introducing Keith
to the piano in question,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.400
and it wasn't going well.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.776
Jarrett looked to the instrument
a little warily,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.336
played a few notes,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.575
walked around it,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.056
played a few more notes,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.776
muttered something to his producer.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.120
Then the producer
came over to Vera and said ...

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.840
"If you don't get a new piano,
Keith can't play."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.456
There'd been a mistake.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.856
The opera house had provided
the wrong instrument.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.536
This one had this harsh,
tinny upper register,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.840
because all the felt had worn away.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.776
The black notes were sticking,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.696
the white notes were out of tune,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.376
the pedals didn't work

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.576
and the piano itself was just too small.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.016
It wouldn't create the volume

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.960
that would fill a large space
such as the Cologne Opera House.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.560
So Keith Jarrett left.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.240
He went and sat outside in his car,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.976
leaving Vera Brandes

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.640
to get on the phone
to try to find a replacement piano.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.296
Now she got a piano tuner,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.920
but she couldn't get a new piano.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.856
And so she went outside

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.480
and she stood there in the rain,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.720
talking to Keith Jarrett,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.080
begging him not to cancel the concert.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.576
And he looked out of his car

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.280
at this bedraggled,
rain-drenched German teenager,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.056
took pity on her,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.280
and said,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.160
"Never forget ... only for you."

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.896
And so a few hours later,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.360
Jarrett did indeed step out
onto the stage of the opera house,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.560
he sat down at the unplayable piano

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.800
and began.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.640
(Music)

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.056
Within moments it became clear
that something magical was happening.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.656
Jarrett was avoiding
those upper registers,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.296
he was sticking to the middle
tones of the keyboard,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.936
which gave the piece
a soothing, ambient quality.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.496
But also, because the piano was so quiet,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.936
he had to set up these rumbling,
repetitive riffs in the bass.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.216
And he stood up twisting,
pounding down on the keys,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.856
desperately trying to create enough volume
to reach the people in the back row.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.896
It's an electrifying performance.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.856
It somehow has this peaceful quality,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.936
and at the same time it's full of energy,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.160
it's dynamic.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.439
And the audience loved it.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.216
Audiences continue to love it

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.336
because the recording of the KÃ¶ln Concert

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.856
is the best-selling piano album in history

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.480
and the best-selling
solo jazz album in history.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.320
Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.120
He had embraced that mess, and it soared.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.336
But let's think for a moment
about Jarrett's initial instinct.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.936
He didn't want to play.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.176
Of course,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.136
I think any of us,
in any remotely similar situation,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.736
would feel the same way,
we'd have the same instinct.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.055
We don't want to be asked
to do good work with bad tools.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.720
We don't want to have to overcome
unnecessary hurdles.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.920
But Jarrett's instinct was wrong,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.160
and thank goodness he changed his mind.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.640
And I think our instinct is also wrong.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.216
I think we need to gain
a bit more appreciation

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.280
for the unexpected advantages
of having to cope with a little mess.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.696
So let me give you some examples

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.176
from cognitive psychology,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.616
from complexity science,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.096
from social psychology,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.760
and of course, rock 'n' roll.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.736
So cognitive psychology first.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.576
We've actually known for a while

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.936
that certain kinds of difficulty,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.536
certain kinds of obstacle,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.322
can actually improve our performance.

00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:05.056
For example,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.816
the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.056
a few years ago,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.136
teamed up with high school teachers.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.896
And he asked them to reformat the handouts

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.280
that they were giving
to some of their classes.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.534
So the regular handout would be formatted
in something straightforward,

00:05:19.558 --> 00:05:21.998
such as Helvetica or Times New Roman.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.856
But half these classes were getting
handouts that were formatted

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.576
in something sort of intense,
like Haettenschweiler,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.616
or something with a zesty bounce,
like Comic Sans italicized.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.456
Now, these are really ugly fonts,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.656
and they're difficult fonts to read.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.776
But at the end of the semester,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.416
students were given exams,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.096
and the students who'd been asked
to read the more difficult fonts,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.176
had actually done better on their exams,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.736
in a variety of subjects.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.776
And the reason is,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.336
the difficult font had slowed them down,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.416
forced them to work a bit harder,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.016
to think a bit more
about what they were reading,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.280
to interpret it ...

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.560
and so they learned more.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.520
Another example.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.856
The psychologist Shelley Carson
has been testing Harvard undergraduates

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.856
for the quality
of their attentional filters.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.256
What do I mean by that?

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.496
What I mean is,
imagine you're in a restaurant,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.256
you're having a conversation,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.416
there are all kinds of other conversations
going on in the restaurant,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.776
you want to filter them out,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.936
you want to focus
on what's important to you.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.176
Can you do that?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.176
If you can, you have
good, strong attentional filters.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.256
But some people really struggle with that.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.016
Some of Carson's undergraduate
subjects struggled with that.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.976
They had weak filters,
they had porous filters --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.376
let a lot of external information in.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.536
And so what that meant is they were
constantly being interrupted

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.136
by the sights and the sounds
of the world around them.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.216
If there was a television on
while they were doing their essays,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.656
they couldn't screen it out.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.109
Now, you would think
that that was a disadvantage ...

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.696
but no.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.696
When Carson looked at what
these students had achieved,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.496
the ones with the weak filters

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.936
were vastly more likely

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.736
to have some real
creative milestone in their lives,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.096
to have published their first novel,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.800
to have released their first album.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.896
These distractions were actually
grists to their creative mill.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.760
They were able to think outside the box
because their box was full of holes.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.936
Let's talk about complexity science.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.818
So how do you solve a really complex --

00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:29.856
the world's full
of complicated problems --

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.056
how do you solve
a really complicated problem?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.216
For example, you try to make a jet engine.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.456
There are lots and lots
of different variables,

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.433
the operating temperature, the materials,

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:40.896
all the different dimensions, the shape.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.456
You can't solve that kind
of problem all in one go,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.696
it's too hard.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.936
So what do you do?

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.896
Well, one thing you can do
is try to solve it step-by-step.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.616
So you have some kind of prototype

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.056
and you tweak it,
you test it, you improve it.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.880
You tweak it, you test it, you improve it.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:05.536
Now, this idea of marginal gains
will eventually get you a good jet engine.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.856
And it's been quite widely
implemented in the world.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.376
So you'll hear about it, for example,
in high performance cycling,

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.696
web designers will talk about trying
to optimize their web pages,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.016
they're looking
for these step-by-step gains.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.880
That's a good way
to solve a complicated problem.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.880
But you know what would
make it a better way?

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.800
A dash of mess.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.336
You add randomness,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.736
early on in the process,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.256
you make crazy moves,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.655
you try stupid things that shouldn't work,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.696
and that will tend to make
the problem-solving work better.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.256
And the reason for that is

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.336
the trouble with the step-by-step process,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.576
the marginal gains,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.136
is they can walk you
gradually down a dead end.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.376
And if you start with the randomness,
that becomes less likely,

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.800
and your problem-solving
becomes more robust.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.120
Let's talk about social psychology.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.816
So the psychologist Katherine Phillips,
with some colleagues,

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.896
recently gave murder mystery
problems to some students,

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.776
and these students
were collected in groups of four

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.136
and they were given dossiers
with information about a crime --

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.040
alibis and evidence,
witness statements and three suspects.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.176
And the groups of four students
were asked to figure out who did it,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.400
who committed the crime.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.680
And there were two treatments
in this experiment.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.976
In some cases these were four friends,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.560
they all knew each other well.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.936
In other cases,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.880
three friends and a stranger.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.096
And you can see where I'm going with this.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.376
Obviously I'm going to say

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.816
that the groups with the stranger
solved the problem more effectively,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.120
which is true, they did.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.296
Actually, they solved the problem
quite a lot more effectively.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.200
So the groups of four friends,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.096
they only had a 50-50 chance
of getting the answer right.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.816
Which is actually not that great --

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.776
in multiple choice, for three answers?
50-50's not good.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.976
(Laughter)

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.696
The three friends and the stranger,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.536
even though the stranger
didn't have any extra information,

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.096
even though it was just a case

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:16.416
of how that changed the conversation
to accommodate that awkwardness,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.136
the three friends and the stranger,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.826
they had a 75 percent chance
of finding the right answer.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.576
That's quite a big leap in performance.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.936
But I think what's really interesting

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.199
is not just that the three friends
and the stranger did a better job,

00:10:28.223 --> 00:10:29.663
but how they felt about it.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.336
So when Katherine Phillips
interviewed the groups of four friends,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.216
they had a nice time,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.200
they also thought they'd done a good job.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.920
They were complacent.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.296
When she spoke to the three
friends and the stranger,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.816
they had not had a nice time --

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.440
it's actually rather difficult,
it's rather awkward ...

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.720
and they were full of doubt.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.120
They didn't think they'd done a good job
even though they had.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.816
And I think that really exemplifies

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.080
the challenge that we're
dealing with here.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.496
Because, yeah --

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.376
the ugly font,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.176
the awkward stranger,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.520
the random move ...

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.656
these disruptions help us solve problems,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.016
they help us become more creative.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.096
But we don't feel that they're helping us.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.160
We feel that they're
getting in the way ...

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.240
and so we resist.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.440
And that's why the last example
is really important.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.576
So I want to talk about somebody

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.536
from the background
of the world of rock 'n' roll.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.456
And you may know him,
he's actually a TED-ster.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.856
His name is Brian Eno.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.696
He is an ambient composer --
rather brilliant.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.400
He's also a kind of catalyst

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.176
behind some of the great
rock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.816
He's worked with David Bowie on "Heroes,"

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.976
he worked with U2 on "Achtung Baby"
and "The Joshua Tree,"

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.536
he's worked with DEVO,

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.136
he's worked with Coldplay,
he's worked with everybody.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.080
And what does he do to make
these great rock bands better?

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.960
Well, he makes a mess.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.656
He disrupts their creative processes.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.776
It's his role to be the awkward stranger.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.216
It's his role to tell them

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.416
that they have to play
the unplayable piano.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.096
And one of the ways
in which he creates this disruption

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.080
is through this remarkable
deck of cards --

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.240
I have my signed copy here --
thank you, Brian.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.416
They're called The Oblique Strategies,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.298
he developed them with a friend of his.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.840
And when they're stuck in the studio,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.176
Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.656
He'll draw one at random,

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.936
and he'll make the band
follow the instructions on the card.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.280
So this one ...

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.336
"Change instrument roles."

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.075
Yeah, everyone swap instruments --
Drummer on the piano --

00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:51.096
Brilliant, brilliant idea.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.800
"Look closely at the most 
embarrassing details. Amplify them."

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.080
"Make a sudden, destructive,
unpredictable action. Incorporate."

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.320
These cards are disruptive.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.720
Now, they've proved their worth
in album after album.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.176
The musicians hate them.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.696
(Laughter)

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.136
So Phil Collins was playing drums
on an early Brian Eno album.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.160
He got so frustrated he started
throwing beer cans across the studio.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.776
Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist,

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.576
working with Eno
on David Bowie's "Lodger" album,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.176
and at one point
he turns to Brian and says,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.680
"Brian, this experiment is stupid."

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.120
But the thing is
it was a pretty good album,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.320
but also,

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.856
Carlos Alomar, 35 years later,
now uses The Oblique Strategies.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.616
And he tells his students
to use The Oblique Strategies

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.360
because he's realized something.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.880
Just because you don't like it
doesn't mean it isn't helping you.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.762
The strategies actually
weren't a deck of cards originally,

00:14:02.786 --> 00:14:03.976
they were just a list --

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.816
list on the recording studio wall.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.640
A checklist of things
you might try if you got stuck.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.480
The list didn't work.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.360
Know why?

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.600
Not messy enough.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.696
Your eye would go down the list

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.776
and it would settle on whatever
was the least disruptive,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.000
the least troublesome,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.360
which of course misses the point entirely.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.536
And what Brian Eno came to realize was,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.056
yes, we need to run
the stupid experiments,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.136
we need to deal
with the awkward strangers,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.296
we need to try to read the ugly fonts.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.576
These things help us.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.976
They help us solve problems,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.896
they help us be more creative.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.120
But also ...

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.520
we really need some persuasion
if we're going to accept this.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.440
So however we do it ...

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.456
whether it's sheer willpower,

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.560
whether it's the flip of a card

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.760
or whether it's a guilt trip
from a German teenager,

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.816
all of us, from time to time,

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.280
need to sit down and try and play
the unplayable piano.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.856
Thank you.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.760
(Applause)
