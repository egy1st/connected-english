00:00:00.856 --> 00:00:05.595
I am in search of another planet
in the universe where life exists.

00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:09.388
I can't see this planet
with my naked eyes

00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:11.698
or even with the most powerful telescopes

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:13.072
we currently possess.

00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:15.851
But I know that it's there.

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:19.018
And understanding contradictions
that occur in nature

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:20.398
will help us find it.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:22.530
On our planet,

00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:24.527
where there's water, there's life.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:27.826
So we look for planets that orbit
at just the right distance

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.149
from their stars.

00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:31.569
At this distance,

00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:35.073
shown in blue on this diagram
for stars of different temperatures,

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:38.951
planets could be warm enough
for water to flow on their surfaces

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:40.373
as lakes and oceans

00:00:40.397 --> 00:00:41.938
where life might reside.

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:46.501
Some astronomers focus their time
and energy on finding planets

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.966
at these distances from their stars.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.393
What I do picks up where their job ends.

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:54.853
I model the possible
climates of exoplanets.

00:00:55.353 --> 00:00:57.179
And here's why that's important:

00:00:57.203 --> 00:01:00.693
there are many factors
besides distance from its star

00:01:00.717 --> 00:01:03.321
that control whether
a planet can support life.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:05.813
Take the planet Venus.

00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:10.337
It's named after the Roman goddess
of love and beauty,

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:13.971
because of its benign,
ethereal appearance in the sky.

00:01:14.487 --> 00:01:17.651
But spacecraft measurements
revealed a different story.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.049
The surface temperature is close
to 900 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:22.073 --> 00:01:23.572
500 Celsius.

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:26.539
That's hot enough to melt lead.

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:30.953
Its thick atmosphere, not its distance
from the sun, is the reason.

00:01:30.977 --> 00:01:34.080
It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids,

00:01:34.104 --> 00:01:37.744
trapping heat from the sun
and scorching the planet's surface.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:42.728
The reality totally contradicted
initial perceptions of this planet.

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:46.349
From these lessons
from our own solar system,

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:48.389
we've learned that a planet's atmosphere

00:01:48.413 --> 00:01:52.015
is crucial to its climate
and potential to host life.

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:55.882
We don't know what the atmospheres
of these planets are like

00:01:55.906 --> 00:02:00.274
because the planets are so small
and dim compared to their stars

00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:01.963
and so far away from us.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.791
For example, one of the closest planets
that could support surface water --

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:10.172
it's called Gliese 667 Cc --

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:14.132
such a glamorous name, right,
nice phone number for a name --

00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:16.591
it's 23 light years away.

00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:19.861
So that's more than 100 trillion miles.

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:22.999
Trying to measure
the atmospheric composition

00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:27.039
of an exoplanet passing
in front of its host star is hard.

00:02:27.444 --> 00:02:29.324
It's like trying to see a fruit fly

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.634
passing in front of a car's headlight.

00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:35.825
OK, now imagine that car
is 100 trillion miles away,

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.221
and you want to know
the precise color of that fly.

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:42.375
So I use computer models

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:45.502
to calculate the kind of atmosphere
a planet would need

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:48.225
to have a suitable climate
for water and life.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.551
Here's an artist's concept
of the planet Kepler-62f,

00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:55.058
with the Earth for reference.

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:57.547
It's 1,200 light years away,

00:02:57.571 --> 00:02:59.798
and just 40 percent larger than Earth.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:04.361
Our NSF-funded work found that it
could be warm enough for open water

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:08.494
from many types of atmospheres
and orientations of its orbit.

00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:11.651
So I'd like future telescopes
to follow up on this planet

00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:13.246
to look for signs of life.

00:03:14.476 --> 00:03:17.865
Ice on a planet's surface
is also important for climate.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.084
Ice absorbs longer,
redder wavelengths of light,

00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:23.238
and reflects shorter, bluer light.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.759
That's why the iceberg
in this photo looks so blue.

00:03:27.092 --> 00:03:30.589
The redder light from the sun
is absorbed on its way through the ice.

00:03:30.613 --> 00:03:33.470
Only the blue light
makes it all the way to the bottom.

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:36.339
Then it gets reflected
back to up to our eyes

00:03:36.363 --> 00:03:37.939
and we see blue ice.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.564
My models show that planets
orbiting cooler stars

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:44.756
could actually be warmer
than planets orbiting hotter stars.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.319
There's another contradiction --

00:03:46.343 --> 00:03:50.117
that ice absorbs the longer
wavelength light from cooler stars,

00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:53.249
and that light, that energy,
heats the ice.

00:03:54.622 --> 00:03:56.982
Using climate models to explore

00:03:57.006 --> 00:04:00.111
how these contradictions
can affect planetary climate

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:03.309
is vital to the search for life elsewhere.

00:04:04.128 --> 00:04:07.305
And it's no surprise
that this is my specialty.

00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:10.500
I'm an African-American female astronomer

00:04:10.524 --> 00:04:12.636
and a classically trained actor

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.495
who loves to wear makeup
and read fashion magazines,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.352
so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate
contradictions in nature --

00:04:21.376 --> 00:04:22.488
(Laughter)

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.976
(Applause)

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.093
... and how they can inform our search
for the next planet where life exists.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.153
My organization, Rising Stargirls,

00:04:33.177 --> 00:04:36.605
teaches astronomy
to middle-school girls of color,

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.085
using theater, writing and visual art.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:44.674
That's another contradiction --
science and art don't often go together,

00:04:44.698 --> 00:04:48.500
but interweaving them can help
these girls bring their whole selves

00:04:48.524 --> 00:04:49.723
to what they learn,

00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:53.187
and maybe one day join
the ranks of astronomers

00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:54.965
who are full of contradictions,

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:58.139
and use their backgrounds
to discover, once and for all,

00:04:58.163 --> 00:05:01.179
that we are truly not alone
in the universe.

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:03.584
Thank you.

00:05:03.608 --> 00:05:12.424
(Applause)
