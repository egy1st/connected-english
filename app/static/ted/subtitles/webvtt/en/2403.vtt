00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.096
Roy Price is a man that most of you
have probably never heard about,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.616
even though he may have been responsible

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.536
for 22 somewhat mediocre 
minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.736
He may have also been responsible
for 22 very entertaining minutes,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.016
but not very many of you.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.936
And all of that goes back to a decision

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.960
that Roy had to make
about three years ago.

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:28.816
So you see, Roy Price
is a senior executive with Amazon Studios.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.856
That's the TV production
company of Amazon.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.136
He's 47 years old, slim, spiky hair,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.976
describes himself on Twitter
as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.176
And Roy Price has a very responsible job,
because it's his responsibility

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.256
to pick the shows, the original content
that Amazon is going to make.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.616
And of course that's
a highly competitive space.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.376
I mean, there are so many
TV shows already out there,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.576
that Roy can't just choose any show.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.696
He has to find shows
that are really, really great.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.536
So in other words, he has to find shows

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.936
that are on the very right end
of this curve here.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.616
So this curve here
is the rating distribution

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.016
of about 2,500 TV shows
on the website IMDB,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.936
and the rating goes from one to 10,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.936
and the height here shows you
how many shows get that rating.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.656
So if your show gets a rating
of nine points or higher, that's a winner.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.496
Then you have a top two percent show.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.416
That's shows like "Breaking Bad,"
"Game of Thrones," "The Wire,"

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.736
so all of these shows that are addictive,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.816
whereafter you've watched a season,
your brain is basically like,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.016
"Where can I get more of these episodes?"

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.240
That kind of show.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.416
On the left side, just for clarity,
here on that end,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.616
you have a show called
"Toddlers and Tiaras" --

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.296
(Laughter)

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.856
-- which should tell you enough

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.071
about what's going on
on that end of the curve.

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:55.256
Now, Roy Price is not worried about
getting on the left end of the curve,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.216
because I think you would have to have
some serious brainpower

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.936
to undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras."

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.896
So what he's worried about
is this middle bulge here,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.736
the bulge of average TV,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.616
you know, those shows
that aren't really good or really bad,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.295
they don't really get you excited.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.176
So he needs to make sure
that he's really on the right end of this.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.776
So the pressure is on,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.976
and of course it's also the first time

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.176
that Amazon is even
doing something like this,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.536
so Roy Price does not want
to take any chances.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.016
He wants to engineer success.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.816
He needs a guaranteed success,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.416
and so what he does is,
he holds a competition.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.576
So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.896
and from those ideas,
through an evaluation,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.016
they select eight candidates for TV shows,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.256
and then he just makes the first episode
of each one of these shows

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.416
and puts them online for free
for everyone to watch.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.696
And so when Amazon
is giving out free stuff,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.256
you're going to take it, right?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.416
So millions of viewers
are watching those episodes.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.656
What they don't realize is that,
while they're watching their shows,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.976
actually, they are being watched.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.336
They are being watched
by Roy Price and his team,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.736
who record everything.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.136
They record when somebody presses play,
when somebody presses pause,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.696
what parts they skip,
what parts they watch again.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.976
So they collect millions of data points,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.096
because they want
to have those data points

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.816
to then decide
which show they should make.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.016
And sure enough,
so they collect all the data,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.616
they do all the data crunching,
and an answer emerges,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.856
and the answer is,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.416
"Amazon should do a sitcom
about four Republican US Senators."

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.656
They did that show.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.840
So does anyone know the name of the show?

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.016
(Audience: "Alpha House.")

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.496
Yes, "Alpha House,"

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.616
but it seems like not too many of you here
remember that show, actually,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.496
because it didn't turn out that great.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.376
It's actually just an average show,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.976
actually -- literally, in fact, because
the average of this curve here is at 7.4,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.416
and "Alpha House" lands at 7.5,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.456
so a slightly above average show,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.400
but certainly not what Roy Price
and his team were aiming for.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.176
Meanwhile, however,
at about the same time,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.776
at another company,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.016
another executive did manage
to land a top show using data analysis,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.616
and his name is Ted,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.056
Ted Sarandos, who is
the Chief Content Officer of Netflix,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.216
and just like Roy,
he's on a constant mission

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.736
to find that great TV show,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.776
and he uses data as well to do that,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.815
except he does it
a little bit differently.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.576
So instead of holding a competition,
what he did -- and his team of course --

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.136
was they looked at all the data
they already had about Netflix viewers,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.256
you know, the ratings
they give their shows,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.976
the viewing histories,
what shows people like, and so on.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.896
And then they use that data to discover

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.536
all of these little bits and pieces
about the audience:

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.016
what kinds of shows they like,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.136
what kind of producers,
what kind of actors.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.736
And once they had
all of these pieces together,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.416
they took a leap of faith,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.536
and they decided to license

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.016
not a sitcom about four Senators

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.920
but a drama series about a single Senator.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.416
You guys know the show?

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.736
(Laughter)

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.496
Yes, "House of Cards," and Netflix
of course, nailed it with that show,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.656
at least for the first two seasons.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.656
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.856
"House of Cards" gets
a 9.1 rating on this curve,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.056
so it's exactly
where they wanted it to be.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.496
Now, the question of course is,
what happened here?

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.176
So you have two very competitive,
data-savvy companies.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.056
They connect all of these
millions of data points,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.456
and then it works
beautifully for one of them,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.336
and it doesn't work for the other one.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.576
So why?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.056
Because logic kind of tells you
that this should be working all the time.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.536
I mean, if you're collecting
millions of data points

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.296
on a decision you're going to make,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.936
then you should be able
to make a pretty good decision.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.176
You have 200 years
of statistics to rely on.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.216
You're amplifying it
with very powerful computers.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.520
The least you could expect
is good TV, right?

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.600
And if data analysis
does not work that way,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.576
then it actually gets a little scary,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.416
because we live in a time
where we're turning to data more and more

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.920
to make very serious decisions
that go far beyond TV.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.000
Does anyone here know the company
Multi-Health Systems?

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.736
No one. OK, that's good actually.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.976
OK, so Multi-Health Systems
is a software company,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.816
and I hope that nobody here in this room

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.016
ever comes into contact
with that software,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.136
because if you do,
it means you're in prison.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.336
(Laughter)

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.896
If someone here in the US is in prison,
and they apply for parole,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.216
then it's very likely that
data analysis software from that company

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.856
will be used in determining
whether to grant that parole.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.456
So it's the same principle
as Amazon and Netflix,

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.096
but now instead of deciding whether
a TV show is going to be good or bad,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.016
you're deciding whether a person
is going to be good or bad.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.536
And mediocre TV, 22 minutes,
that can be pretty bad,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.200
but more years in prison,
I guess, even worse.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.496
And unfortunately, there is actually
some evidence that this data analysis,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.736
despite having lots of data,
does not always produce optimum results.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.482
And that's not because a company
like Multi-Health Systems

00:07:01.506 --> 00:07:03.133
doesn't know what to do with data.

00:07:03.158 --> 00:07:05.456
Even the most data-savvy
companies get it wrong.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.880
Yes, even Google gets it wrong sometimes.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.176
In 2009, Google announced
that they were able, with data analysis,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.336
to predict outbreaks of influenza,
the nasty kind of flu,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.136
by doing data analysis
on their Google searches.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.016
And it worked beautifully,
and it made a big splash in the news,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.176
including the pinnacle
of scientific success:

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.656
a publication in the journal "Nature."

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.296
It worked beautifully
for year after year after year,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.976
until one year it failed.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.256
And nobody could even tell exactly why.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.976
It just didn't work that year,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.936
and of course that again made big news,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.576
including now a retraction

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.440
of a publication
from the journal "Nature."

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.816
So even the most data-savvy companies,
Amazon and Google,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.976
they sometimes get it wrong.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.936
And despite all those failures,

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.816
data is moving rapidly
into real-life decision-making --

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.656
into the workplace,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.496
law enforcement,

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.720
medicine.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.736
So we should better make sure
that data is helping.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.896
Now, personally I've seen
a lot of this struggle with data myself,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.896
because I work in computational genetics,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.416
which is also a field
where lots of very smart people

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.096
are using unimaginable amounts of data
to make pretty serious decisions

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.680
like deciding on a cancer therapy
or developing a drug.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.896
And over the years,
I've noticed a sort of pattern

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.376
or kind of rule, if you will,
about the difference

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.096
between successful
decision-making with data

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.736
and unsuccessful decision-making,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.640
and I find this a pattern worth sharing,
and it goes something like this.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.655
So whenever you're
solving a complex problem,

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.416
you're doing essentially two things.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.736
The first one is, you take that problem
apart into its bits and pieces

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.256
so that you can deeply analyze
those bits and pieces,

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.296
and then of course
you do the second part.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.976
You put all of these bits and pieces
back together again

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.336
to come to your conclusion.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.696
And sometimes you
have to do it over again,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.376
but it's always those two things:

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.720
taking apart and putting
back together again.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.896
And now the crucial thing is

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.816
that data and data analysis

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.336
is only good for the first part.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.576
Data and data analysis,
no matter how powerful,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.056
can only help you taking a problem apart
and understanding its pieces.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.576
It's not suited to put those pieces
back together again

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.496
and then to come to a conclusion.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.256
There's another tool that can do that,
and we all have it,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.576
and that tool is the brain.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.536
If there's one thing a brain is good at,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.816
it's taking bits and pieces
back together again,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.856
even when you have incomplete information,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.456
and coming to a good conclusion,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.416
especially if it's the brain of an expert.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.096
And that's why I believe
that Netflix was so successful,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.696
because they used data and brains
where they belong in the process.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.256
They use data to first understand
lots of pieces about their audience

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.696
that they otherwise wouldn't have
been able to understand at that depth,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.336
but then the decision
to take all these bits and pieces

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.696
and put them back together again
and make a show like "House of Cards,"

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.136
that was nowhere in the data.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.136
Ted Sarandos and his team
made that decision to license that show,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.541
which also meant, by the way,
that they were taking

00:10:03.565 --> 00:10:06.416
a pretty big personal risk
with that decision.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.456
And Amazon, on the other hand,
they did it the wrong way around.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.216
They used data all the way
to drive their decision-making,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.656
first when they held
their competition of TV ideas,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.376
then when they selected "Alpha House"
to make as a show.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.896
Which of course was
a very safe decision for them,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.376
because they could always
point at the data, saying,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.096
"This is what the data tells us."

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.360
But it didn't lead to the exceptional
results that they were hoping for.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.096
So data is of course a massively
useful tool to make better decisions,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.496
but I believe that things go wrong

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.096
when data is starting
to drive those decisions.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.896
No matter how powerful,
data is just a tool,

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.256
and to keep that in mind,
I find this device here quite useful.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.496
Many of you will ...

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.736
(Laughter)

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.976
Before there was data,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.856
this was the decision-making
device to use.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.136
(Laughter)

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.496
Many of you will know this.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.473
This toy here is called the Magic 8 Ball,

00:10:58.497 --> 00:10:59.696
and it's really amazing,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.616
because if you have a decision to make,
a yes or no question,

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.376
all you have to do is you shake the ball,
and then you get an answer --

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.216
"Most Likely" -- right here
in this window in real time.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.336
I'll have it out later for tech demos.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.576
(Laughter)

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.176
Now, the thing is, of course --
so I've made some decisions in my life

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.096
where, in hindsight,
I should have just listened to the ball.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.456
But, you know, of course,
if you have the data available,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.536
you want to replace this with something
much more sophisticated,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.176
like data analysis
to come to a better decision.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.816
But that does not change the basic setup.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.016
So the ball may get smarter
and smarter and smarter,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.856
but I believe it's still on us
to make the decisions

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.896
if we want to achieve
something extraordinary,

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.856
on the right end of the curve.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.376
And I find that a very encouraging
message, in fact,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.376
that even in the face
of huge amounts of data,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.496
it still pays off to make decisions,

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.176
to be an expert in what you're doing

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.296
and take risks.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.096
Because in the end, it's not data,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.080
it's risks that will land you
on the right end of the curve.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.056
Thank you.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.760
(Applause)
