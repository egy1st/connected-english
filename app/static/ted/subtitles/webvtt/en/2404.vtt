00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.576
Our grandparents' generation
created an amazing system

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.176
of canals and reservoirs
that made it possible

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.616
for people to live in places
where there wasn't a lot of water.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.176
For example, during the Great Depression,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.816
they created the Hoover Dam,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.256
which in turn, created Lake Mead

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.896
and made it possible for the cities
of Las Vegas and Phoenix

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.656
and Los Angeles to provide water

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.880
for people who lived
in a really dry place.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.656
In the 20th century,
we literally spent trillions of dollars

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.096
building infrastructure
to get water to our cities.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.056
In terms of economic development,
it was a great investment.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.056
But in the last decade,
we've seen the combined effects

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.856
of climate change, population growth
and competition for water resources

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.536
threaten these vital lifelines
and water resources.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.696
This figure shows you the change
in the lake level of Lake Mead

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.976
that happened in the last 15 years.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.336
You can see starting around the year 2000,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.256
the lake level started to drop.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.096
And it was dropping at such a rate

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.000
that it would have left the drinking water
intakes for Las Vegas high and dry.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.456
The city became so concerned about this

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.416
that they recently constructed
a new drinking water intake structure

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.496
that they referred to as the "Third Straw"

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.240
to pull water out
of the greater depths of the lake.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.736
The challenges associated
with providing water to a modern city

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.816
are not restricted
to the American Southwest.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.176
In the year 2007, the third largest
city in Australia, Brisbane,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.136
came within 6 months
of running out of water.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.416
A similar drama is playing out today
in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.256
where the main reservoir for the city

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.176
has gone from being
completely full in 2010,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.376
to being nearly empty today

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.880
as the city approaches
the 2016 Summer Olympics.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.536
For those of us who are fortunate enough

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.616
to live in one
of the world's great cities,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.776
we've never truly experienced
the effects of a catastrophic drought.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.536
We like to complain
about the navy showers we have to take.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.936
We like our neighbors to see
our dirty cars and our brown lawns.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.496
But we've never really faced
the prospect of turning on the tap

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.040
and having nothing come out.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.736
And that's because when things
have gotten bad in the past,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.816
it's always been possible
to expand a reservoir

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.040
or dig a few more groundwater wells.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.936
Well, in a time when all
of the water resources are spoken for,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.336
it's not going to be possible
to rely on this tried and true way

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.696
of providing ourselves with water.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.496
Some people think that we're going
to solve the urban water problem

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520
by taking water from our rural neighbors.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.656
But that's an approach that's fraught
with political, legal and social dangers.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.216
And even if we succeed in grabbing
the water from our rural neighbors,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.736
we're just transferring
the problem to someone else

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.376
and there's a good chance
it will come back and bite us

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.296
in the form of higher food prices

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.280
and damage to the aquatic ecosystems
that already rely upon that water.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.576
I think that there's a better way
to solve our urban water crisis

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.016
and I think that's to open up
four new local sources of water

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.776
that I liken to faucets.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.896
If we can make smart investments
in these new sources of water

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.216
in the coming years,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.576
we can solve our urban water problem

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.936
and decrease the likelihood
that we'll ever run across

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.200
the effects of a catastrophic drought.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.336
Now, if you told me 20 years ago

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.976
that a modern city could exist
without a supply of imported water,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.640
I probably would have dismissed you
as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.016
But my own experiences

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.416
working with some of the world's most
water-starved cities in the last decades

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.376
have shown me that we have
the technologies and the management skills

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.296
to actually transition away
from imported water,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.640
and that's what I want
to tell you about tonight.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.616
The first source of local water
supply that we need to develop

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.776
to solve our urban water problem

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.056
will flow with the rainwater
that falls in our cities.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.496
One of the great tragedies
of urban development

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.496
is that as our cities grew,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.176
we started covering all the surfaces
with concrete and asphalt.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.616
And when we did that,
we had to build storm sewers

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.736
to get the water
that fell on the cities out

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.696
before it could cause flooding,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.560
and that's a waste
of a vital water resource.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.976
Let me give you an example.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.216
This figure here shows you
the volume of water

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.856
that could be collected
in the city of San Jose

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.656
if they could harvest the stormwater
that fell within the city limits.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.456
You can see from the intersection
of the blue line and the black dotted line

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.776
that if San Jose could just capture half
of the water that fell within the city,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.136
they'd have enough water
to get them through an entire year.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.776
Now, I know what some of you
are probably thinking.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.376
"The answer to our problem
is to start building great big tanks

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.256
and attaching them
to the downspouts of our roof gutters,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.520
rainwater harvesting."

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.576
Now, that's an idea
that might work in some places.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.856
But if you live in a place
where it mainly rains in the winter time

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.296
and most of the water demand
is in the summertime,

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.056
it's not a very cost-effective way
to solve a water problem.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.096
And if you experience the effects
of a multiyear drought,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.296
like California's currently experiencing,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.536
you just can't build a rainwater tank
that's big enough to solve your problem.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.576
I think there's a lot more practical way

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.096
to harvest the stormwater and
the rainwater that falls in our cities,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.896
and that's to capture it
and let it percolate into the ground.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.096
After all, many of our cities are sitting
on top of a natural water storage system

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.520
that can accommodate
huge volumes of water.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.896
For example, historically,
Los Angeles has obtained

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.936
about a third of its water supply
from a massive aquifer

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.000
that underlies the San Fernando Valley.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.176
Now, when you look at the water
that comes off of your roof

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.656
and runs off of your lawn
and flows down the gutter,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.800
you might say to yourself,
"Do I really want to drink that stuff?"

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.696
Well, the answer is
you don't want to drink it

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.536
until it's been treated a little bit.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.656
And so the challenge that we face
in urban water harvesting

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.416
is to capture the water, clean the water

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.680
and get it underground.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.536
And that's exactly
what the city of Los Angeles is doing

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.656
with a new project that they're building
in Burbank, California.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.776
This figure here shows
the stormwater park that they're building

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.976
by hooking a series of stormwater
collection systems, or storm sewers,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.576
and routing that water
into an abandoned gravel quarry.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.496
The water that's captured in the quarry

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.296
is slowly passed
through a man-made wetland,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.936
and then it goes
into that ball field there

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.896
and percolates into the ground,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.280
recharging the drinking water
aquifer of the city.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.976
And in the process
of passing through the wetland

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.776
and percolating through the ground,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.296
the water encounters microbes
that live on the surfaces of the plants

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.896
and the surfaces of the soil,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.400
and that purifies the water.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.536
And if the water's
still not clean enough to drink

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.256
after it's been through
this natural treatment process,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.616
the city can treat it again

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.216
when they pump if back out
of the groundwater aquifers

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.320
before they deliver it to people to drink.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.816
The second tap that we need to open up
to solve our urban water problem

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.296
will flow with the wastewater

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.480
that comes out
of our sewage treatment plants.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.837
Now, many of you are probably familiar
with the concept of recycled water.

00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:16.736
You've probably seen signs like this

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.016
that tell you that the shrubbery
and the highway median

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.536
and the local golf course

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.416
is being watered with water

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.720
that used to be
in a sewage treatment plant.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.336
We've been doing this
for a couple of decades now.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.376
But what we're learning
from our experience

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.496
is that this approach is much more
expensive that we expected it to be.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.616
Because once we build
the first few water recycling systems

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.416
close to the sewage treatment plant,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.679
we have to build longer
and longer pipe networks

00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:44.863
to get that water to where it needs to go.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.400
And that becomes prohibitive
in terms of cost.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.216
What we're finding is

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.256
that a much more cost-effective
and practical way of recycling wastewater

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.856
is to turn treated wastewater
into drinking water

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.400
through a two-step process.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.216
In the first step in this process
we pressurize the water

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.976
and pass it through
a reverse osmosis membrane:

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.416
a thin, permeable plastic membrane

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.976
that allows water molecules
to pass through

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.776
but traps and retains the salts,
the viruses and the organic chemicals

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.720
that might be present in the wastewater.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.456
In the second step in the process,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.976
we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.696
and shine ultraviolet light on the water.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.616
The ultraviolet light
cleaves the hydrogen peroxide

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.776
into two parts that are called
hydroxyl radicals,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.895
and these hydroxyl radicals
are very potent forms of oxygen

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.320
that break down most organic chemicals.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.176
After the water's been
through this two-stage process,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.816
it's safe to drink.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.096
I know,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.696
I've been studying recycled water

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.136
using every measurement technique
known to modern science

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.600
for the past 15 years.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.736
We've detected some chemicals

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.336
that can make it through
the first step in the process,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.360
but by the time we get to the second step,

00:08:58.384 --> 00:09:00.296
the advanced oxidation process,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.736
we rarely see any chemicals present.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.936
And that's in stark contrast
to the taken-for-granted water supplies

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.840
that we regularly drink all the time.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.416
There's another way we can recycle water.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.536
This is an engineered treatment wetland
that we recently built

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.336
on the Santa Ana River
in Southern California.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.456
The treatment wetland receives water
from a part of the Santa Ana River

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.096
that in the summertime consists
almost entirely of wastewater effluent

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.136
from cities like Riverside
and San Bernardino.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.216
The water comes
into our treatment wetland,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.576
it's exposed to sunlight and algae

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.096
and those break down
the organic chemicals,

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.656
remove the nutrients
and inactivate the waterborne pathogens.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.136
The water gets put back
in the Santa Ana River,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.056
it flows down to Anaheim,

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.336
gets taken out at Anaheim
and percolated into the ground,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.016
and becomes the drinking water
of the city of Anaheim,

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.976
completing the trip
from the sewers of Riverside County

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.280
to the drinking water supply
of Orange County.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.416
Now, you might think
that this idea of drinking wastewater

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.856
is some sort of futuristic fantasy
or not commonly done.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.256
Well, in California, we already recycle
about 40 billion gallons a year

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.376
of wastewater through the two-stage
advanced treatment process

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.696
I was telling you about.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.456
That's enough water to be
the supply of about a million people

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.240
if it were their sole water supply.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.496
The third tap that we need to open up
will not be a tap at all,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.136
it will be a kind of virtual tap,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.256
it will be the water conservation
that we manage to do.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.736
And the place where we need to think
about water conservation is outdoors

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.376
because in California
and other modern American cities,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.800
about half of our water use
happens outdoors.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.216
In the current drought,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.816
we've seen that it's possible

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.816
to have our lawns survive
and our plants survive

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.736
with about half as much water.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.776
So there's no need
to start painting concrete green

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.896
and putting in Astroturf
and buying cactuses.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.136
We can have California-friendly
landscaping with soil moisture detectors

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.056
and smart irrigation controllers

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.520
and have beautiful
green landscapes in our cities.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.776
The fourth and final water tap
that we need to open up

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.696
to solve our urban water problem

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.760
will flow with desalinated seawater.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.336
Now, I know what you probably heard
people say about seawater desalination.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.536
"It's a great thing to do if you have
lots of oil, not a lot of water

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.936
and you don't care about climate change."

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.296
Seawater desalination is energy-intensive
no matter how you slice it.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.936
But that characterization
of seawater desalination

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.976
as being a nonstarter
is hopelessly out of date.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.776
We've made tremendous progress
in seawater desalination

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.040
in the past two decades.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.576
This picture shows you

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.576
the largest seawater desalination plant
in the Western hemisphere

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.416
that's currently being built
north of San Diego.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.696
Compared to the seawater
desalination plant

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.016
that was built in
Santa Barbara 25 years ago,

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.696
this treatment plant
will use about half the energy

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.240
to produce a gallon of water.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.576
But just because seawater desalination
has become less energy-intensive,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.839
doesn't mean we should start building
desalination plants everywhere.

00:12:02.863 --> 00:12:04.599
Among the different choices we have,

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:06.736
it's probably the most energy-intensive

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.696
and potentially environmentally damaging

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.640
of the options to create
a local water supply.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.776
So there it is.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.576
With these four sources of water,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.920
we can move away
from our reliance on imported water.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.176
Through reform in the way we landscape
our surfaces and our properties,

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.296
we can reduce outdoor water use
by about 50 percent,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.776
thereby increasing 
the water supply by 25 percent.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.324
We can recycle the water
that makes it into the sewer,

00:12:33.348 --> 00:12:36.428
thereby increasing
our water supply by 40 percent.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.496
And we can make up the difference
through a combination

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.000
of stormwater harvesting
and seawater desalination.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.096
So, let's create a water supply

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.776
that will be able
to withstand any of the challenges

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.376
that climate change throws at us
in the coming years.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.736
Let's create a water supply
that uses local sources

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.800
and leaves more water
in the environment for fish and for food.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:06.656
Let's create a water system that's
consistent with out environmental values.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.136
And let's do it for our children
and our grandchildren

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.776
and let's tell them this is the system

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.136
that they have to
take care of in the future

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.096
because it's our last chance
to create a new kind of water system.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.978
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:13:21.002 --> 00:13:23.922
(Applause)
