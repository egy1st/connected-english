00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:01.960
A few years ago,

00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:05.444
I got one of those spam emails.

00:00:05.468 --> 00:00:07.572
And it managed
to get through my spam filter.

00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:10.152
I'm not quite sure how,
but it turned up in my inbox,

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.325
and it was from a guy
called Solomon Odonkoh.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:13.564
(Laughter)

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.310
I know.

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:16.564
(Laughter)

00:00:16.588 --> 00:00:17.748
It went like this:

00:00:17.772 --> 00:00:19.390
it said, "Hello James Veitch,

00:00:19.414 --> 00:00:22.953
I have an interesting business proposal
I want to share with you, Solomon."

00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:27.159
Now, my hand was kind of hovering
on the delete button, right?

00:00:27.183 --> 00:00:30.142
I was looking at my phone.
I thought, I could just delete this.

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:34.607
Or I could do what I think
we've all always wanted to do.

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:37.622
(Laughter)

00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:40.750
And I said, "Solomon,
Your email intrigues me."

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.476
(Laughter)

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.476
(Applause)

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.920
And the game was afoot.

00:00:53.214 --> 00:00:56.175
He said, "Dear James Veitch,
We shall be shipping Gold to you."

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.896
(Laughter)

00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:01.199
"You will earn 10%
of any gold you distributes."

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:02.987
(Laughter)

00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:05.358
So I knew I was dealing
with a professional.

00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:08.957
(Laughter)

00:01:10.408 --> 00:01:11.892
I said, "How much is it worth?"

00:01:13.058 --> 00:01:15.558
He said, "We will start
with smaller quantity," --

00:01:15.582 --> 00:01:16.734
I was like, aww --

00:01:16.758 --> 00:01:19.552
and then he said, "of 25 kgs.

00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:21.576
(Laughter)

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.433
The worth should be about $2.5 million."

00:01:27.536 --> 00:01:30.211
I said, "Solomon, if we're
going to do it, let's go big.

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:37.137
(Applause)

00:01:38.286 --> 00:01:42.191
I can handle it.
How much gold do you have?"

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:45.302
(Laughter)

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:48.361
He said, "It is not a matter
of how much gold I have,

00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:50.436
what matters is
your capability of handling.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.683
We can start with 50 kgs
as trial shipment."

00:01:52.707 --> 00:01:54.578
I said, "50 kgs?

00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:56.245
There's no point doing this at all

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:58.499
unless you're shipping
at least a metric ton."

00:01:58.523 --> 00:01:59.718
(Laughter)

00:01:59.742 --> 00:02:02.511
(Applause)

00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:05.324
He said, "What do you do for a living?"

00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:07.203
(Laughter)

00:02:08.283 --> 00:02:10.625
I said, "I'm a hedge fund
executive bank manager."

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.057
(Laughter)

00:02:15.243 --> 00:02:17.953
This isn't the first time
I've shipped bullion, my friend,

00:02:17.993 --> 00:02:19.638
no no no.

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.140
Then I started to panic.

00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:23.792
I was like, "Where are you based?"

00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:24.998
I don't know about you,

00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:27.390
but I think if we're going
via the postal service,

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:28.722
it ought to be signed for.

00:02:28.746 --> 00:02:29.920
That's a lot of gold."

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:33.103
He said, "It will not be easy
to convince my company

00:02:33.127 --> 00:02:34.837
to do larger quantity shipment."

00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.389
I said, "Solomon, I'm completely
with you on this one.

00:02:37.413 --> 00:02:40.859
I'm putting together a visual for you
to take into the board meeting.

00:02:40.883 --> 00:02:42.063
Hold tight."

00:02:42.087 --> 00:02:45.116
(Laughter)

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:50.356
This is what I sent Solomon.

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:53.332
(Laughter)

00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:59.268
(Applause)

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.884
I don't know if we have
any statisticians in the house,

00:03:02.908 --> 00:03:04.917
but there's definitely something going on.

00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:06.575
(Laughter)

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.450
I said, "Solomon, attached to this email
you'll find a helpful chart.

00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:13.574
I've had one of my assistants
run the numbers.

00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:15.384
(Laughter)

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:17.789
We're ready for shipping
as much gold as possible."

00:03:18.254 --> 00:03:21.305
There's always a moment where they try
to tug your heartstrings,

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.671
and this was it for Solomon.

00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:25.322
He said, "I will be so much happy
if the deal goes well,

00:03:25.346 --> 00:03:28.021
because I'm going to get
a very good commission as well."

00:03:28.045 --> 00:03:31.339
And I said, "That's amazing,
What are you going to spend your cut on?"

00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:33.513
And he said, "On RealEstate,
what about you?"

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:37.180
I thought about it for a long time.

00:03:38.925 --> 00:03:40.564
And I said, "One word;

00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:42.783
Hummus."

00:03:42.807 --> 00:03:45.988
(Laughter)

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:49.411
"It's going places.

00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:50.618
(Laughter)

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:53.041
I was in Sainsbury's the other day

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.118
and there were like
30 different varieties.

00:03:55.142 --> 00:03:58.039
Also you can cut up carrots,
and you can dip them.

00:03:58.063 --> 00:03:59.919
Have you ever done that, Solomon?"

00:03:59.943 --> 00:04:01.943
(Laughter)

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:03.990
He said, "I have to go bed now."

00:04:04.014 --> 00:04:06.893
(Laughter)

00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:09.776
(Applause)

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.177
"Till morrow.

00:04:12.407 --> 00:04:13.559
Have sweet dream."

00:04:13.583 --> 00:04:14.971
I didn't know what to say!

00:04:15.643 --> 00:04:18.530
I said, "Bonsoir
my golden nugget, bonsoir."

00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:20.855
(Laughter)

00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:24.475
Guys, you have to understand,
this had been going for, like, weeks,

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:26.650
albeit hitherto the greatest
weeks of my life,

00:04:26.674 --> 00:04:28.301
but I had to knock it on the head.

00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:29.905
It was getting a bit out of hand.

00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:32.881
Friends were saying, "James,
do you want to come for a drink?"

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.921
I was like, "I can't, I'm expecting
an email about some gold."

00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:37.989
So I figured I had
to knock it on the head.

00:04:38.013 --> 00:04:40.069
I had to take it
to a ridiculous conclusion.

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:41.245
So I concocted a plan.

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:43.621
I said, "Solomon,
I'm concerned about security.

00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:44.852
When we email each other,

00:04:44.876 --> 00:04:46.027
we need to use a code."

00:04:48.582 --> 00:04:49.733
And he agreed.

00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:51.145
(Laughter)

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.058
I said, "Solomon, I spent all night
coming up with this code

00:04:54.082 --> 00:04:56.187
we need to use
in all further correspondence:

00:04:56.211 --> 00:04:59.954
Lawyer: Gummy Bear.

00:05:01.564 --> 00:05:03.423
Bank: Cream Egg.

00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:06.169
Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle.
Claim: Peanut M&amp;Ms.

00:05:06.193 --> 00:05:08.113
Documents: Jelly Beans.

00:05:08.137 --> 00:05:10.281
Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard."

00:05:10.305 --> 00:05:12.137
(Laughter)

00:05:12.602 --> 00:05:14.653
I knew these were all words
they use, right?

00:05:14.962 --> 00:05:18.637
I said, "Please call me Kitkat
in all further correspondence."

00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:22.724
(Laughter)

00:05:24.002 --> 00:05:26.430
I didn't hear back.
I thought, I've gone too far.

00:05:26.454 --> 00:05:28.796
I've gone too far.
So I had to backpedal a little.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.105
I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on?

00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:33.462
KitKat."

00:05:33.486 --> 00:05:34.732
(Laughter)

00:05:34.756 --> 00:05:36.628
Because you have to be consistent.

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.074
Then I did get an email back from him.

00:05:41.098 --> 00:05:44.278
He said, "The Business is on
and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.280
I said, "Dude, you have to use the code!"

00:05:49.478 --> 00:05:52.066
What followed is the greatest email
I've ever received.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.272
(Laughter)

00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:58.221
I'm not joking, this is what
turned up in my inbox.

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:00.089
This was a good day.

00:06:01.224 --> 00:06:02.375
"The business is on.

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:06.684
I am trying to raise the balance
for the Gummy Bear --

00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:08.107
(Laughter)

00:06:11.485 --> 00:06:14.710
so he can submit all the needed
Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans

00:06:14.734 --> 00:06:15.887
to the Creme Egg,

00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:20.094
for the Peanut M&amp;Ms process to start.

00:06:20.118 --> 00:06:21.497
(Laughter)

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.069
Send 1,500 pounds

00:06:24.093 --> 00:06:26.482
via a Giant Gummy Lizard."

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:33.275
(Applause)

00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:39.797
And that was so much fun, right,

00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:41.171
that it got me thinking:

00:06:41.195 --> 00:06:44.106
like, what would happen if I just spent
as much time as could

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.224
replying to as many
scam emails as I could?

00:06:48.145 --> 00:06:51.121
And that's what I've been doing

00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:53.245
for three years

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:54.550
on your behalf.

00:06:54.574 --> 00:06:56.969
(Laughter)

00:06:56.993 --> 00:06:59.312
(Applause)

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:02.950
Crazy stuff happens when you start
replying to scam emails.

00:07:02.974 --> 00:07:04.125
It's really difficult,

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:05.727
and I highly recommend we do it.

00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:07.592
I don't think what I'm doing is mean.

00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:10.368
There are a lot of people
who do mean things to scammers.

00:07:10.392 --> 00:07:13.979
All I'm doing is wasting their time.

00:07:14.894 --> 00:07:17.053
And I think any time
they're spending with me

00:07:17.077 --> 00:07:19.674
is time they're not spending
scamming vulnerable adults

00:07:19.698 --> 00:07:21.071
out of their savings, right?

00:07:21.584 --> 00:07:25.147
And if you're going to do this --
and I highly recommend you do --

00:07:25.171 --> 00:07:27.182
get yourself a pseudonymous email address.

00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:28.810
Don't use your own email address.

00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:31.688
That's what I was doing at the start
and it was a nightmare.

00:07:31.712 --> 00:07:34.268
I'd wake up in the morning
and have a thousand emails

00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:35.499
about penis enlargements,

00:07:35.523 --> 00:07:37.720
only one of which
was a legitimate response --

00:07:37.744 --> 00:07:39.840
(Laughter)

00:07:39.864 --> 00:07:41.206
to a medical question I had.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.999
But I'll tell you what, though, guys,

00:07:43.023 --> 00:07:46.024
I'll tell you what: any day is a good day,
any day is a good day

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:48.469
if you receive an email
that begins like this:

00:07:49.558 --> 00:07:52.372
(Laughter)

00:07:52.396 --> 00:07:54.189
"I AM WINNIE MANDELA,

00:07:55.094 --> 00:07:58.388
THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA
THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."

00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:00.315
I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela.

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:01.420
(Laughter)

00:08:01.444 --> 00:08:02.594
I know so many.

00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:06.602
"I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS
OUT OF THE COUNTRY

00:08:06.626 --> 00:08:09.396
BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND
NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION."

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.579
Let that sink in.

00:08:11.864 --> 00:08:14.504
She sent me this, which is hysterical.

00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:17.475
(Laughter)

00:08:17.499 --> 00:08:18.658
And this.

00:08:18.682 --> 00:08:21.881
And this looks fairly legitimate,
this is a letter of authorization.

00:08:21.905 --> 00:08:25.294
But to be honest, if there's nothing
written on it, it's just a shape!

00:08:25.318 --> 00:08:27.171
(Laughter)

00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:29.993
I said, "Winnie,
I'm really sorry to hear of this.

00:08:30.017 --> 00:08:32.010
Given that Nelson died three months ago,

00:08:32.034 --> 00:08:34.620
I'd describe his health condition
as fairly serious."

00:08:34.644 --> 00:08:37.458
(Laughter)

00:08:37.482 --> 00:08:41.001
That's the worst health condition
you can have, not being alive.

00:08:43.373 --> 00:08:46.144
She said, "KINDLY COMPLY
WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS.

00:08:46.168 --> 00:08:47.326
ONE LOVE."

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.302
(Laughter)

00:08:50.325 --> 00:08:52.143
I said, "Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY."

00:08:52.167 --> 00:08:55.671
(Laughter)

00:08:55.695 --> 00:08:59.191
(Applause)
