WEBVTT

00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:03.468
I have been a police officer
for a very, very long time.

00:00:03.492 --> 00:00:08.690
And you see these notes in my hand
because I'm also a black preacher.

00:00:09.305 --> 00:00:10.988
(Laughter)

00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:13.227
And if you know anything
about black preachers,

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:16.463
we'll close, and then we'll keep
going for another 20 minutes.

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:17.524
(Laughter)

00:00:17.548 --> 00:00:19.941
So I need this to keep
pushing this thing forward.

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.214
I've been a police officer
for a very long time,

00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:23.818
and I mean I predated technology.

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:25.438
I'm talking about before pagers.

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:26.695
(Laughter)

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.980
Laugh if you want to,
but I'm telling the truth.

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:33.706
I predate War on Our Fellow Man --
I mean, War on Drugs.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.213
I predate all of that.

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:37.009
I predate so much

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:38.816
and I've been through ebbs and flows

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.207
and I've been through good and bad times,

00:00:41.231 --> 00:00:45.389
and still I absolutely love
being a police officer.

00:00:46.207 --> 00:00:49.958
I love being a police officer
because it's always been a calling for me

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.362
and never a job.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.584
And even with that,

00:00:54.538 --> 00:00:58.814
my personal truth is that
law enforcement is in a crisis.

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:01.130
It's an invisible crisis,

00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:03.780
and it has been for many, many years.

00:01:04.787 --> 00:01:06.656
Even though we in law enforcement say,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.282
"You know what?
We can't arrest our way out of this."

00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:13.069
We say in law enforcement things like,

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:15.609
"Yeah, it's illegal to profile."

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.166
You know what?

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.548
In law enforcement, we even agree
that we have to adopt this thinking

00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:22.777
and become more oriented
to community policing.

00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.711
And yet all the while, still,

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:27.932
we continue in the same vein,

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:31.916
the same vein that contradicts
everything that we just admitted.

00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:35.834
And so that's the reason for me,
several years ago.

00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:39.408
Because I was tired of the racism,
I was tired of discrimination,

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.025
I was tired of the "-isms"
and the schisms.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.429
I was just so tired.

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:46.057
I was tired of the vicious cycle,

00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:49.310
and I was tired of it even
in the beloved agency

00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:52.247
in the department that I still love today.

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:54.900
And so my wife and I, we sat down

00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:57.741
and we decided and we targeted
a date that we would retire.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.734
We would retire and I would
go off into the sunset,

00:02:00.758 --> 00:02:03.591
maybe do ministry full time,
love my wife a long time.

00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:05.256
Y'all know what I'm talking about.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.685
(Laughter)

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.432
But we decided that I would retire.

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:11.635
But then there was a higher power than I.

00:02:12.492 --> 00:02:15.360
There was a love for the city

00:02:15.384 --> 00:02:18.585
that I loved, that I grew up in,
that I was educated in --

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.309
a city that pulled my heart
back into the system.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.221
So we didn't retire.

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:26.310
We didn't retire

00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:28.798
and so what happened was,

00:02:28.822 --> 00:02:32.050
over the next -- I would say,
18 months, 19 months,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.083
I had this passion to implement
some radical policing.

00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:39.124
And so now, over the next 19 months,

00:02:39.148 --> 00:02:42.991
I shifted, and I transcended
from being a drug sergeant --

00:02:44.277 --> 00:02:46.113
ready to retire as a drug sergeant --

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:48.699
and went from level to level to level,

00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:51.152
until I find myself
as a district commander,

00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:54.119
commander of the worst district
in Baltimore city.

00:02:54.453 --> 00:02:56.154
We call it the Eastern District,

00:02:56.178 --> 00:02:57.788
the most violent district,

00:02:57.812 --> 00:02:59.519
the most impoverished district --

00:02:59.543 --> 00:03:03.145
46 percent unemployment in that district.

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:06.238
National rating at that time,

00:03:06.262 --> 00:03:09.234
national rating, the AIDS
and the tuberculosis [rating],

00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:11.659
was always on the top 10 list

00:03:11.683 --> 00:03:14.706
for zip codes for cities
across the nation,

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.469
or just zip codes across the nation.

00:03:16.493 --> 00:03:19.111
The top 10 -- I didn't say state,
I didn't say city --

00:03:19.135 --> 00:03:20.475
that little neighborhood.

00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.714
And I said, you know what?
We gotta do something different.

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:27.398
We gotta do something different.
We gotta think radical.

00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:29.159
We gotta think outside the box.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.412
And so in order to bring change
that I desperately wanted

00:03:32.436 --> 00:03:34.143
and I desperately felt in my heart,

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:36.456
I had to start listening
to that inner spirit.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.913
I had to start listening
to that man on the inside

00:03:38.937 --> 00:03:42.040
that went against everything
that I had been trained to do.

00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:44.166
But we still did it.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.887
We still did it because we listened
to that inner spirit,

00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:48.172
because I realized this:

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:52.245
if I was to see real police reform

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.898
in the communities that I had
authority over for public safety,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.973
we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'.

00:04:00.728 --> 00:04:01.881
We had to change it.

00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:04.628
And so what we did
is we started to think holistically

00:04:04.652 --> 00:04:05.968
and not paramilitarily.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:07.922
So we thought differently.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.018
And we started to realize

00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:12.352
that it could never be
and never should have been

00:04:12.376 --> 00:04:13.885
us versus them.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.118
And so I decided to come
to that intersection

00:04:17.142 --> 00:04:20.363
where I could meet all classes,
all races, all creeds, all colors;

00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:22.928
where I would meet the businesses
and the faith-based,

00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:24.238
and the eds, the meds,

00:04:24.262 --> 00:04:25.770
and I would meet all the people

00:04:25.794 --> 00:04:28.623
that made up the communities
that I had authority over.

00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:31.165
So I met them and I began to listen.

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:32.641
See, police have a problem.

00:04:32.665 --> 00:04:35.260
Off the top, we want to bring
things into the community

00:04:35.284 --> 00:04:38.252
and come up with these extravagant
strategies and deployments,

00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:40.451
but we never talk
to the community about them.

00:04:40.475 --> 00:04:43.303
And we shove them into the community
and say, "Take that."

00:04:43.806 --> 00:04:46.203
But we said we'd get rid
of that stinkin' thinkin',

00:04:46.227 --> 00:04:47.775
so we talked to our communities.

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:49.667
We said, "This is your community table.

00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:51.954
We'll pull up a chair.
We want to hear from you.

00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:53.918
What's going to work in your community?"

00:04:53.942 --> 00:04:56.071
And then some great things
started to happen.

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:57.246
See, here's the thing:

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.990
I had to figure out a way to shift
130 cops that were under my tutelage

00:05:03.014 --> 00:05:05.126
from being occupiers of communities

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.339
to being partners.

00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:09.047
I had to figure out how to do that.

00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:11.050
Because here's the crazy thing:

00:05:11.074 --> 00:05:14.719
in law enforcement, we have evolved
into something incredible.

00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:16.680
Listen, we have become great protectors.

00:05:16.704 --> 00:05:18.132
We know how to protect you.

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.948
But we have exercised that arm
so much, so very much.

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:26.138
If I was a natural police department

00:05:26.162 --> 00:05:28.043
and I represented a police department,

00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:30.956
you would see this incredible,
beautiful, 23-inch arm.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.583
(Laughter)

00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:35.686
It's pretty, ain't it? It's cut up.

00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:39.568
No fat on it. Mmm it look good.
It just look good!

00:05:39.592 --> 00:05:41.726
(Laughter)

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.651
That's a great arm -- protection!

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:46.778
That's who we are, but we've exercised
it so much sometimes

00:05:47.255 --> 00:05:48.810
that it has led to abuse.

00:05:50.008 --> 00:05:54.004
It's led to coldness and callousness
and dehumanized us.

00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:56.093
And we've forgotten

00:05:56.117 --> 00:05:57.530
the mantra across this nation

00:05:57.554 --> 00:05:59.624
is to protect and serve.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.044
Y'all don't know that? Protect and serve.

00:06:02.068 --> 00:06:03.069
(Laughter)

00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:04.498
So you look at the other arm,

00:06:04.522 --> 00:06:06.657
and then you look at it
and ... there it is.

00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:07.854
(Laughter)

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:10.156
You know, it's kinda weak.

00:06:10.926 --> 00:06:12.163
It looks sickly.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:14.758
It's withering and it's dying

00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.504
because we've invested so much
in our protective arm.

00:06:19.302 --> 00:06:22.159
But we forgot to treat our communities

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:23.566
like they're our customers;

00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:26.991
like they're our sons and daughters,
our brothers and sisters,

00:06:27.015 --> 00:06:28.205
our mothers and fathers.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.849
And so somehow, along the way,

00:06:30.873 --> 00:06:32.304
we've gotten out of balance.

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.066
And because we are a proud profession,

00:06:35.952 --> 00:06:39.093
it is very hard for us to look
in the mirror and see our mistakes.

00:06:39.117 --> 00:06:40.838
It's even harder to make a change.

00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:44.648
And so, as I try to hurry
and get through this,

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:46.365
I need to say this:

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.331
it's not just law enforcement, though.

00:06:48.818 --> 00:06:51.149
Because every one of us
makes up a community.

00:06:51.674 --> 00:06:53.359
Everybody makes up a community.

00:06:53.678 --> 00:06:55.606
And as communities -- can I say this? --

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.002
we have put too much responsibility
on law enforcement.

00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.419
Too much.

00:07:01.443 --> 00:07:05.686
(Applause)

00:07:06.706 --> 00:07:09.353
And then we have the audacity
and the nerve to get upset

00:07:09.377 --> 00:07:11.480
with law enforcement
when we take action.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.679
There is no way in the world

00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:18.158
that we, as a community,
should be calling the police

00:07:18.182 --> 00:07:20.071
for kids playing ball in the street.

00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:24.807
No way in the world that we
should be calling the police

00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:26.917
because my neighbor's
music is up too loud,

00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:29.695
because his dog came over
to my yard and did a number two;

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:32.240
there's no way we should
be calling the police.

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:34.906
But we have surrendered
so much of our responsibility.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.064
Listen, when I was a little boy
coming up in Baltimore --

00:07:38.088 --> 00:07:40.225
and listen, we played
rough in the street --

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:42.660
I ain't never see the police
come and break us up.

00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:44.951
You know who came? It was the elders.

00:07:44.975 --> 00:07:47.110
It was the parental figures
in the community.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.027
It was those guardians,
it was that village mentality.

00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:53.106
They came and said, "Stop that!"
and "Do this." and "Stop that."

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:57.411
We had mentors throughout
all of the community.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.009
So it takes all of us, all of us.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.820
And when I say community,

00:08:01.844 --> 00:08:04.871
I'm talking about everything
that makes up a community, even --

00:08:04.895 --> 00:08:07.826
listen, because I'm a preacher,
I'm very hard on the churches,

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.597
because I believe the churches
too often have become MIA,

00:08:10.621 --> 00:08:11.778
missing in action.

00:08:11.802 --> 00:08:14.370
I believe they have shifted
over the last 10, 20 years

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:15.870
from being community churches,

00:08:15.894 --> 00:08:19.362
where you walk outside your door,
round the corner and you're in church.

00:08:19.386 --> 00:08:22.246
They shifted from that and became
commuter churches.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.730
So you now have churches who have
become disconnected by default

00:08:26.754 --> 00:08:29.209
from the very community
where they're planted.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.439
And they don't take care
of that community.

00:08:33.153 --> 00:08:35.821
I could go on and on,
but I really need to wrap this up.

00:08:35.845 --> 00:08:38.496
Community and policing:

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.821
we've all lost that precious gift,
and I call it relational equity.

00:08:43.498 --> 00:08:45.421
We've lost it with one another.

00:08:45.445 --> 00:08:47.460
It's not somebody else's fault --

00:08:47.484 --> 00:08:48.808
it's all of our fault.

00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:51.337
We all take responsibility in this.

00:08:51.361 --> 00:08:54.562
But I say this: it's not too late
for all of us to build our cities

00:08:54.586 --> 00:08:56.224
and nation to make it great again.

00:08:56.248 --> 00:08:57.407
It is never too late.

00:08:57.431 --> 00:08:58.747
It is never too late.

00:08:59.428 --> 00:09:00.829
You see, after three years

00:09:00.853 --> 00:09:04.091
of my four-and-a-half-year
commandship in that district,

00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:05.269
three years in,

00:09:05.293 --> 00:09:07.972
after putting pastors
in the car with my police

00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:10.171
because I knew this --
it's a little secret --

00:09:10.195 --> 00:09:11.354
I knew this:

00:09:11.378 --> 00:09:14.043
it was hard to stay a nasty police officer

00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:16.168
while you're riding around
with a clergy.

00:09:16.192 --> 00:09:18.374
(Laughter)

00:09:18.398 --> 00:09:24.195
(Applause)

00:09:26.476 --> 00:09:30.005
You'd be getting in and out of the car,
looking to your right, talking about:

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:33.565
"Father, forgive me, for I have sinned,"
all day long -- you can't do it!

00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:35.842
So we came up with some
incredible initiatives,

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:39.361
engagements for our community
and police to build that trust back.

00:09:39.385 --> 00:09:40.944
We began to deal with our youth

00:09:40.968 --> 00:09:44.146
and with those who we consider
are on the wrong side of the fence.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.903
We knew we had an economic problem,

00:09:45.927 --> 00:09:47.419
so we began to create jobs.

00:09:47.443 --> 00:09:49.491
We knew there was sickness
in our community

00:09:49.515 --> 00:09:52.009
and they didn't have access
to proper medical care,

00:09:52.033 --> 00:09:53.192
so we'd partner up.

00:09:53.216 --> 00:09:55.289
We got to that intersection
and partnered up

00:09:55.313 --> 00:09:57.400
with anybody that wanted
to partner with us

00:09:57.424 --> 00:09:59.591
and talked about
what we needed holistically,

00:09:59.615 --> 00:10:01.128
never thinking about the crime.

00:10:01.152 --> 00:10:02.847
Because at the end of the day,

00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:04.934
if we took care
of the needs of the people,

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.521
if we got to the root cause,

00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:09.438
the crime would take care of itself.

00:10:10.599 --> 00:10:12.065
It would take care of itself.

00:10:12.089 --> 00:10:16.744
(Applause)

00:10:17.897 --> 00:10:21.979
And so, after three years
of a four-and-a-half-year stint,

00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:24.341
we looked back and we looked over

00:10:24.365 --> 00:10:27.730
and found out that we were
at a 40-year historical low:

00:10:27.754 --> 00:10:30.635
our crime numbers, our homicides --

00:10:30.659 --> 00:10:33.116
everything had dropped
down, back to the 1970s.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.556
And it might go back further,

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.497
but the problem is, we only
started keeping data since 1970.

00:10:37.521 --> 00:10:40.617
Forty-year crime low, so much so,
I had other commanders call me,

00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:42.058
"Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man?

00:10:42.082 --> 00:10:44.186
Whatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!"

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.625
(Laughter)

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:47.308
And so we gave them some of that.

00:10:48.968 --> 00:10:50.420
And in a short period of time,

00:10:50.444 --> 00:10:52.721
the city went to a 30-year crime low.

00:10:53.181 --> 00:10:55.830
For the first time in 30 years,
we fell, Baltimore city,

00:10:55.854 --> 00:10:58.218
to under 200 homicides -- 197 to be exact.

00:10:58.242 --> 00:10:59.401
And we celebrated,

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:03.108
because we had learned
to become great servers,

00:11:03.132 --> 00:11:04.869
become great servers first.

00:11:04.893 --> 00:11:07.215
But I gotta tell you this:
these last few years,

00:11:08.607 --> 00:11:10.227
as much as we had learned

00:11:10.856 --> 00:11:13.803
to become great proactive police officers

00:11:13.827 --> 00:11:17.588
and great relational police officers
rather than reactive,

00:11:17.612 --> 00:11:19.677
these last years have disappointed me.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.052
They have broken my heart.

00:11:22.644 --> 00:11:24.481
The uprising still hurts.

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:27.270
It still hurts my heart,

00:11:27.294 --> 00:11:30.276
because truly I believe
that it should've never happened.

00:11:31.014 --> 00:11:32.807
I believe it should've never happened

00:11:32.831 --> 00:11:35.775
if we were allowed to continue
along the vein that we were in,

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:37.479
servicing our community,

00:11:37.503 --> 00:11:40.439
treating them like human beings,
treating them with respect,

00:11:40.463 --> 00:11:42.027
loving on them first.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.830
If we continued in that vein,

00:11:44.854 --> 00:11:46.703
it would've never happened.

00:11:46.727 --> 00:11:49.303
But somehow, we went back
to business as usual.

00:11:49.956 --> 00:11:51.450
But I'm excited again!

00:11:52.164 --> 00:11:55.509
I'm excited again, because now
we have a police commissioner

00:11:55.533 --> 00:11:58.974
who not only talks
about community policing,

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.118
but he absolutely understands it,

00:12:02.142 --> 00:12:04.214
and more importantly, he embraces it.

00:12:04.238 --> 00:12:05.957
So I'm very excited now.

00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:08.930
Listen, I'm excited about Baltimore today,

00:12:08.954 --> 00:12:13.203
because we, as many cities,
I believe shall rise from the ashes.

00:12:13.973 --> 00:12:16.862
I believe -- I truly believe --

00:12:16.886 --> 00:12:17.908
(Applause)

00:12:17.932 --> 00:12:19.710
that we will be great again.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.810
I believe,

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.541
as we continue to wrap arms
and continue to say,

00:12:25.565 --> 00:12:26.763
"We're in this together,"

00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:28.630
because it's not just an intersection:

00:12:28.654 --> 00:12:32.288
once we meet, we now gotta get
on the same path for the same goals,

00:12:32.312 --> 00:12:34.360
and this city will become great again.

00:12:34.384 --> 00:12:36.345
This nation will become great again.

00:12:36.369 --> 00:12:38.788
Because we have the same goal:
we all want peace.

00:12:38.812 --> 00:12:40.546
We all want respect for one another.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.720
We all want love.

00:12:41.744 --> 00:12:43.636
And I believe we are back on that road,

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.030
and I'm so excited about it.

00:12:45.054 --> 00:12:48.402
So listen, I thank you for giving me
a few minutes of your time.

00:12:48.426 --> 00:12:49.656
God bless you all.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.681
(Applause)

00:12:50.705 --> 00:12:51.856
God bless you.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.301
(Applause)
