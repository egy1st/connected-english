00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.096
Welcome to Bayeku,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.496
a riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos --

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.896
a vivid representation of several
riverine communities across Nigeria,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.896
communities whose waterways
have been infested

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.776
by an invasive aquatic weed;

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.056
communities where economic livelihoods
have been hampered:

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.296
fishing, marine transportation

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.576
and trading;

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.776
communities where fish yields
have diminished;

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.416
communities where schoolchildren
are unable to go to school

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.736
for days, sometimes weeks, on end.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.616
Who would have thought that this plant

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.376
with round leaves, inflated stems,
and showy, lavender flowers

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.176
would cause such havoc
in these communities.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.976
The plant is known as water hyacinth

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.296
and its botanical name,
Eichhornia crassipes.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.856
Interestingly, in Nigeria,
the plant is also known by other names,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.736
names associated with historical events,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.656
as well as myths.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.776
In some places,
the plant is called Babangida.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.936
When you hear Babangida, you remember
the military and military coups.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.296
And you think: fear, restraint.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.696
In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta,
the plant is also known as Abiola.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.136
When you hear Abiola,
you remember annulled elections

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.776
and you think: dashed hopes.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.336
In the southwestern part of Nigeria,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.576
the plant is known as Gbe'borun.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.376
Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.376
which translates to "gossip,"
or "talebearer."

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.216
When you think of gossip, you think:
rapid reproduction, destruction.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.776
And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.656
the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.376
And when you hear that,
you think of death.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.256
It literally translates
to "death to mother and child."

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.136
I personally had my encounter
with this plant in the year 2009.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.896
It was shortly after I had relocated
from the US to Nigeria.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.456
I'd quit my job in corporate America

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.656
and decided to take
this big leap of faith,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.176
a leap of faith that came
out of a deep sense of conviction

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.336
that there was a lot of work
to do in Nigeria

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.816
in the area of sustainable development.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.816
And so here I was in the year 2009,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.976
actually, at the end of 2009,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.016
in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.696
And I looked to my left
and saw this very arresting image.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.496
It was an image of fishing boats

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.256
that had been hemmed in
by dense mats of water hyacinth.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.656
And I was really pained by what I saw

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.176
because I thought to myself,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.056
"These poor fisherfolk,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.936
how are they going
to go about their daily activities

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.056
with these restrictions."

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.136
And then I thought,
"There's got to be a better way."

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.176
A win-win solution whereby
the environment is taken care of

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.576
by the weeds being cleared out of the way

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.736
and then this being turned
into an economic benefit

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.576
for the communities
whose lives are impacted the most

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.360
by the infestation of the weed.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.736
That, I would say, was my spark moment.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.216
And so I did further research
to find out more

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.176
about the beneficial uses of this weed.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.616
Out of the several,
one struck me the most.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.736
It was the use of the plant
for handicrafts.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.096
And I thought, "What a great idea."

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.496
Personally, I love handicrafts,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.176
especially handicrafts
that are woven around a story.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.816
And so I thought, "This could be
easily deployed within the communities

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.376
without the requirement
of technical skills."

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.040
And I thought to myself,
"Three simple steps to a mega solution."

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.136
First step: Get out into the waterways
and harvest the water hyacinth.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.456
That way, you create access.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.056
Secondly, you dry
the water hyacinth stems.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.495
And thirdly, you weave
the water hyacinth into products.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.896
The third step was a challenge.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.616
See, I'm a computer scientist
by background

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.296
and not someone in the creative arts.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.016
And so I began my quest

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.976
to find out how I can learn how to weave.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.136
And this quest took me
to a community in Ibadan, where I lived,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.576
called Sabo.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.456
Sabo translates to "strangers' quarters."

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.496
And the community is
predominantly made up of people

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.496
from the northern part of the country.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.456
So I literally took
my dried weeds in hand,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.056
there were several more of them,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.416
and went knocking from door to door
to find out who could teach me

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.856
how to weave these
water hyacinth stems into ropes.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.000
And I was directed
to the shed of Malam Yahaya.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.896
The problem, though,
is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.016
and neither did I speak Hausa.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.176
But some little kids came to the rescue

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.976
and helped translate.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.256
And that began my journey
of learning how to weave

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.856
and transform these
dried water hyacinth stems

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.760
into long ropes.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.656
With my long ropes in hand,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.776
I was now equipped to make products.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.216
And that was the beginning
of partnerships.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.216
Working with rattan basket makers
to come up with products.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.016
So with this in hand, I felt confident

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.040
that I would be able
to take this knowledge

00:05:40.064 --> 00:05:42.616
back into the riverine communities

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.896
and help them to transform
their adversity into prosperity.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.096
So taking these weeds
and actually weaving them

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.696
into products that can be sold.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.456
So we have pens, we have tableware,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.256
we have purses, we have tissue boxes.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.816
Thereby, helping the communities

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.016
to see water hyacinth
in a different light.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.696
Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.856
being aesthetic,
being durable, tough, resilient.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.256
Changing names, changing livelihoods.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.256
From Gbe'borun, gossip,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.096
to Olusotan, storyteller.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.136
And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma,
which is "killer of mother and child,"

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.496
to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.896
"provider of food for mother and child."

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.776
And I'd like to end
with a quote by Michael Margolis.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.816
He said, "If you want to learn
about a culture, listen to the stories.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.896
And if you want to change a culture,
change the stories."

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.016
And so, from Makoko community,
to Abobiri, to Ewoi,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.696
to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.296
we have changed the story.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.856
Thank you for listening.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.000
(Applause)
