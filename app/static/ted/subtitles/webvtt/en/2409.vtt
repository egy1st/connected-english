00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.040
I'm an underwater explorer,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.280
more specifically a cave diver.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.816
I wanted to be an astronaut
when I was a little kid,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.440
but growing up in Canada as a young girl,
that wasn't really available to me.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.456
But as it turns out,
we know a lot more about space

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.816
than we do about the underground waterways
coursing through our planet,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.800
the very lifeblood of Mother Earth.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.096
So I decided to do something
that was even more remarkable.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.576
Instead of exploring outer space,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.760
I wanted to explore
the wonders of inner space.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.576
Now, a lot of people will tell you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.720
that cave diving is perhaps
one of the most dangerous endeavors.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.456
I mean, imagine yourself
here in this room,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.376
if you were suddenly
plunged into blackness,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.816
with your only job to find the exit,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.176
sometimes swimming
through these large spaces,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.536
and at other times
crawling beneath the seats,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.096
following a thin guideline,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.856
just waiting for the life support
to provide your very next breath.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.600
Well, that's my workplace.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.736
But what I want to teach you today

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.136
is that our world
is not one big solid rock.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.120
It's a whole lot more like a sponge.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.816
I can swim through a lot of the pores
in our earth's sponge,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.256
but where I can't,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.296
other life-forms and other materials
can make that journey without me.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.336
And my voice is the one
that's going to teach you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.280
about the inside of Mother Earth.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.616
There was no guidebook available to me

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.696
when I decided to be the first person
to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.136
In 2000, this was the largest
moving object on the planet.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.176
It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.136
and we went down there
to explore ice edge ecology

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.800
and search for life-forms beneath the ice.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.616
We use a technology called rebreathers.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.856
It's an awful lot like the same technology
that is used for space walks.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.336
This technology enables us to go deeper

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.096
than we could've imagined
even 10 years ago.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.176
We use exotic gases,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.400
and we can make missions
even up to 20 hours long underwater.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.336
I work with biologists.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.896
It turns out that caves
are repositories of amazing life-forms,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.720
species that we never knew existed before.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.056
Many of these life-forms
live in unusual ways.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.016
They have no pigment
and no eyes in many cases,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.536
and these animals
are also extremely long-lived.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.016
In fact, animals swimming
in these caves today

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.536
are identical in the fossil record

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.896
that predates the extinction
of the dinosaurs.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.656
So imagine that: these are
like little swimming dinosaurs.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.120
What can they teach us
about evolution and survival?

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.136
When we look at an animal
like this remipede swimming in the jar,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.016
he has giant fangs with venom.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.296
He can actually attack something
40 times his size and kill it.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.096
If he were the size of a cat,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.720
he'd be the most dangerous
thing on our planet.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.176
And these animals live
in remarkably beautiful places,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.816
and in some cases,
caves like this, that are very young,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.576
yet the animals are ancient.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.880
How did they get there?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.056
I also work with physicists,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.696
and they're interested oftentimes
in global climate change.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.016
They can take rocks within the caves,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.096
and they can slice them
and look at the layers within with rocks,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.056
much like the rings of a tree,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.096
and they can count back in history

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.816
and learn about the climate on our planet
at very different times.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.336
The red that you see in this photograph

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.696
is actually dust from the Sahara Desert.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.816
So it's been picked up by wind,
blown across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.216
It's rained down in this case
on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.856
It soaks in through the ground

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.856
and deposits itself
in the rocks within these caves.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.696
And when we look back in the layers
of these rocks, we can find times

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.496
when the climate
was very, very dry on earth,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.279
and we can go back
many hundreds of thousands of years.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.816
Paleoclimatologists are also interested

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.136
in where the sea level stands were
at other times on earth.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.376
Here in Bermuda, my team and I embarked

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.456
on the deepest manned dives
ever conducted in the region,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.096
and we were looking for places

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.656
where the sea level
used to lap up against the shoreline,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.520
many hundreds of feet
below current levels.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.376
I also get to work with paleontologists
and archaeologists.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.776
In places like Mexico,
in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.496
we're looking at cultural remains
and also human remains in caves,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.776
and they tell us a lot

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.880
about some of the earliest
inhabitants of these regions.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.256
But my very favorite project of all
was over 15 years ago,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.804
when I was a part of the team
that made the very first

00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:08.136
accurate, three-dimensional map
of a subterranean surface.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.536
This device that I'm
driving through the cave

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.016
was actually creating
a three-dimensional model as we drove it.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.096
We also used ultra low frequency radio

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.800
to broadcast back to the surface
our exact position within the cave.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.136
So I swam under houses and businesses
and bowling alleys and golf courses,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.320
and even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.176
Pretty remarkable, and what that taught me

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.096
was that everything we do
on the surface of our earth

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.536
will be returned to us to drink.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.336
Our water planet is not just
rivers, lakes and oceans,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.136
but it's this vast network of groundwater
that knits us all together.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.016
It's a shared resource
from which we all drink.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.336
And when we can understand
our human connections with our groundwater

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.016
and all of our water resources
on this planet,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.776
then we'll be working on the problem

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.160
that's probably the most important
issue of this century.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.456
So I never got to be that astronaut
that I always wanted to be,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.096
but this mapping device,
designed by Dr. Bill Stone, will be.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.536
It's actually morphed.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.856
It's now a self-swimming autonomous robot,

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.536
artificially intelligent,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.136
and its ultimate goal
is to go to Jupiter's moon Europa

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.760
and explore oceans beneath
the frozen surface of that body.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.400
And that's pretty amazing.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.880
(Applause)
