00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I’m working a lot with motion and animation,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and also I'm an old DJ and a musician.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, music videos are something that I always found interesting,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but they always seem to be so reactive.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and try to make the music be the voice

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and have the animation following it?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track --

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
many of you probably know it. It’s about 25 years old,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and we did this little animation.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And I think that it's maybe interesting, also,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that it deals with two problematic issues,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which are rising waters and religion.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Song: Before God destroyed the people on the Earth,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
he warned Noah to build an Ark.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And after Noah built his Ark,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I believe he told Noah to warn the people

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that they must change all their wicked ways

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
before he come upon them and destroy them.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And when Noah had done built his Ark,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I understand that somebody began to rend a song.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And the song began to move on I understand like this.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And when Noah had done built his Ark ...

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Move on ... In fact ... Concern ...

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And then he went and knocked an old lady house.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?"

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Jack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Because we’re far from home, we’re very tired."

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in."

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It was come dark and rain, will make you weary and tired.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
(Applause)
