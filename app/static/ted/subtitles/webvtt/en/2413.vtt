WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.400
Democracy.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.296
In the West,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.256
we make a colossal mistake
taking it for granted.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.576
We see democracy

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.096
not as the most fragile
of flowers that it really is,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.960
but we see it as part
of our society's furniture.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.960
We tend to think of it
as an intransigent given.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.896
We mistakenly believe that capitalism
begets inevitably democracy.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.256
It doesn't.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.656
Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew
and his great imitators in Beijing

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.616
have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.536
that it is perfectly possible
to have a flourishing capitalism,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.160
spectacular growth,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.016
while politics remains democracy-free.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.456
Indeed, democracy is receding
in our neck of the woods,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.056
here in Europe.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.456
Earlier this year,
while I was representing Greece --

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.216
the newly elected Greek government --

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.936
in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.896
I was told in no uncertain terms
that our nation's democratic process --

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.336
our elections --

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.136
could not be allowed to interfere

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.400
with economic policies
that were being implemented in Greece.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.336
At that moment,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.656
I felt that there could be no greater
vindication of Lee Kuan Yew,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.216
or the Chinese Communist Party,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.976
indeed of some recalcitrant
friends of mine who kept telling me

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.320
that democracy would be banned
if it ever threatened to change anything.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.896
Tonight, here, I want to present to you

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.080
an economic case
for an authentic democracy.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.456
I want to ask you
to join me in believing again

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.480
that Lee Kuan Yew,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.856
the Chinese Communist Party

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.256
and indeed the Eurogroup

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.920
are wrong in believing
that we can dispense with democracy --

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.336
that we need an authentic,
boisterous democracy.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.336
And without democracy,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.216
our societies will be nastier,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.376
our future bleak

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.216
and our great, new technologies wasted.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.496
Speaking of waste,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.295
allow me to point out
an interesting paradox

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.096
that is threatening
our economies as we speak.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.416
I call it the twin peaks paradox.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.736
One peak you understand --

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.376
you know it, you recognize it --

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.456
is the mountain of debts
that has been casting a long shadow

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.296
over the United States,
Europe, the whole world.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.200
We all recognize the mountain of debts.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.000
But few people discern its twin.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.840
A mountain of idle cash

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.200
belonging to rich savers
and to corporations,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.696
too terrified to invest it

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.016
into the productive activities
that can generate the incomes

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.096
from which you can extinguish
the mountain of debts

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.096
and which can produce all those things
that humanity desperately needs,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.776
like green energy.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.136
Now let me give you two numbers.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.496
Over the last three months,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.296
in the United States,
in Britain and in the Eurozone,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.736
we have invested, collectively,
3.4 trillion dollars

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.416
on all the wealth-producing goods --

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.456
things like industrial plants, machinery,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.696
office blocks, schools,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.856
roads, railways, machinery,
and so on and so forth.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.616
$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.496
until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.216
that has been slushing around
in the same countries,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.056
in our financial institutions,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.280
doing absolutely nothing
during the same period

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.296
except inflating stock exchanges
and bidding up house prices.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.576
So a mountain of debt
and a mountain of idle cash

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.296
form twin peaks, 
failing to cancel each other out

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.136
through the normal
operation of the markets.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.480
The result is stagnant wages,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.016
more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds
in America, in Japan and in Europe

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.536
out of work.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.896
And consequently, low aggregate demand,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.136
which in a never-ending cycle,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.880
reinforces the pessimism of the investors,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.696
who, fearing low demand,
reproduce it by not investing --

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.416
exactly like Oedipus' father,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.935
who, terrified
by the prophecy of the oracle

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.696
that his son would grow up to kill him,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.656
unwittingly engineered the conditions

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.680
that ensured that Oedipus,
his son, would kill him.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.560
This is my quarrel with capitalism.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.216
Its gross wastefulness,

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.856
all this idle cash,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.976
should be energized to improve lives,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.336
to develop human talents,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.216
and indeed to finance
all these technologies,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.496
green technologies,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.280
which are absolutely essential
for saving planet Earth.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.536
Am I right in believing
that democracy might be the answer?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.776
I believe so,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.016
but before we move on,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.440
what do we mean by democracy?

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.936
Aristotle defined democracy

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.896
as the constitution
in which the free and the poor,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.080
being in the majority, control government.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.296
Now, of course Athenian democracy
excluded too many.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.360
Women, migrants and,
of course, the slaves.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.296
But it would be a mistake

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.896
to dismiss the significance
of ancient Athenian democracy

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.920
on the basis of whom it excluded.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.936
What was more pertinent,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.816
and continues to be so
about ancient Athenian democracy,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.336
was the inclusion of the working poor,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.056
who not only acquired
the right to free speech,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.336
but more importantly, crucially,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.976
they acquired the rights
to political judgments

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.376
that were afforded equal weight

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.056
in the decision-making
concerning matters of state.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.136
Now, of course, Athenian
democracy didn't last long.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.576
Like a candle that burns brightly,
it burned out quickly.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.816
And indeed,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.096
our liberal democracies today
do not have their roots in ancient Athens.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.456
They have their roots in the Magna Carta,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.736
in the 1688 Glorious Revolution,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.976
indeed in the American constitution.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.016
Whereas Athenian democracy
was focusing on the masterless citizen

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.320
and empowering the working poor,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.416
our liberal democracies are founded
on the Magna Carta tradition,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.536
which was, after all,
a charter for masters.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.856
And indeed, liberal democracy
only surfaced when it was possible

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.736
to separate fully the political sphere
from the economic sphere,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.816
so as to confine the democratic process
fully in the political sphere,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.696
leaving the economic sphere --

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.656
the corporate world, if you want --

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.360
as a democracy-free zone.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.696
Now, in our democracies today,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.216
this separation of the economic
from the political sphere,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.496
the moment it started happening,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.816
it gave rise to an inexorable,
epic struggle between the two,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.056
with the economic sphere
colonizing the political sphere,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.600
eating into its power.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.880
Have you wondered why politicians
are not what they used to be?

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.976
It's not because their DNA
has degenerated.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.616
(Laughter)

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.256
It is rather because one can be
in government today and not in power,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.576
because power has migrated
from the political to the economic sphere,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.840
which is separate.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.736
Indeed,

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.056
I spoke about my quarrel
with capitalism.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.816
If you think about it,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.160
it is a little bit like
a population of predators,

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.800
that are so successful in decimating
the prey that they must feed on,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.696
that in the end they starve.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.936
Similarly,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.656
the economic sphere has been colonizing
and cannibalizing the political sphere

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.056
to such an extent
that it is undermining itself,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.816
causing economic crisis.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.936
Corporate power is increasing,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.176
political goods are devaluing,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.016
inequality is rising,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.616
aggregate demand is falling

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.760
and CEOs of corporations are too scared
to invest the cash of their corporations.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:08.176
So the more capitalism succeeds
in taking the demos out of democracy,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.536
the taller the twin peaks

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.096
and the greater the waste
of human resources

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.560
and humanity's wealth.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.496
Clearly, if this is right,

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.576
we must reunite the political
and economic spheres

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.096
and better do it
with a demos being in control,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.056
like in ancient Athens
except without the slaves

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.040
or the exclusion of women and migrants.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.856
Now, this is not an original idea.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.655
The Marxist left
had that idea 100 years ago

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.360
and it didn't go very well, did it?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.256
The lesson that we learned
from the Soviet debacle

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.616
is that only by a miracle
will the working poor be reempowered,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.616
as they were in ancient Athens,

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.400
without creating new forms
of brutality and waste.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.200
But there is a solution:

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.720
eliminate the working poor.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.616
Capitalism's doing it

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.520
by replacing low-wage workers
with automata, androids, robots.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.296
The problem is

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.536
that as long as the economic
and the political spheres are separate,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.880
automation makes the twin peaks taller,

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.376
the waste loftier

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.456
and the social conflicts deeper,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.680
including --

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.856
soon, I believe --

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.480
in places like China.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.136
So we need to reconfigure,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.816
we need to reunite the economic
and the political spheres,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.216
but we'd better do it
by democratizing the reunified sphere,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.936
lest we end up with
a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.976
that makes The Matrix, the movie,
look like a documentary.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.576
(Laughter)

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.016
So the question is not
whether capitalism will survive

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.360
the technological innovations
it is spawning.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.576
The more interesting question

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.336
is whether capitalism will be succeeded
by something resembling a Matrix dystopia

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.776
or something much closer
to a Star Trek-like society,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.176
where machines serve the humans

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.616
and the humans expend their energies
exploring the universe

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.936
and indulging in long debates
about the meaning of life

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.960
in some ancient, Athenian-like,
high tech agora.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.800
I think we can afford to be optimistic.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.696
But what would it take,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.696
what would it look like

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.600
to have this Star Trek-like utopia,
instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.496
In practical terms,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.256
allow me to share just briefly,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.480
a couple of examples.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.856
At the level of the enterprise,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.216
imagine a capital market,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.920
where you earn capital as you work,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.216
and where your capital follows you
from one job to another,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.736
from one company to another,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.016
and the company --

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.496
whichever one you happen
to work at at that time --

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.840
is solely owned by those who happen
to work in it at that moment.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.096
Then all income stems
from capital, from profits,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.496
and the very concept
of wage labor becomes obsolete.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:23.136
No more separation between those
who own but do not work in the company

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.416
and those who work
but do not own the company;

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.640
no more tug-of-war
between capital and labor;

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.576
no great gap between
investment and saving;

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.840
indeed, no towering twin peaks.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.976
At the level of the global
political economy,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.936
imagine for a moment

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.936
that our national currencies
have a free-floating exchange rate,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.736
with a universal,
global, digital currency,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.776
one that is issued
by the International Monetary Fund,

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.016
the G-20,

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.576
on behalf of all humanity.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.816
And imagine further

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.176
that all international trade
is denominated in this currency --

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.016
let's call it "the cosmos,"

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.440
in units of cosmos --

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.096
with every government agreeing
to be paying into a common fund

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:19.656
a sum of cosmos units proportional
to the country's trade deficit,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.080
or indeed to a country's trade surplus.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.936
And imagine that that fund is utilized
to invest in green technologies,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:34.280
especially in parts of the world
where investment funding is scarce.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.416
This is not a new idea.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.776
It's what, effectively,
John Maynard Keynes proposed

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.120
in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.296
The problem is

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.616
that back then, they didn't have
the technology to implement it.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.856
Now we do,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:55.800
especially in the context
of a reunified political-economic sphere.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.056
The world that I am describing to you

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.536
is simultaneously libertarian,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.136
in that it prioritizes
empowered individuals,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.376
Marxist,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.616
since it will have confined
to the dustbin of history

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.096
the division between capital and labor,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.680
and Keynesian,

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.800
global Keynesian.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.896
But above all else,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.840
it is a world in which we will be able
to imagine an authentic democracy.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.520
Will such a world dawn?

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.896
Or shall we descend
into a Matrix-like dystopia?

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.040
The answer lies in the political choice
that we shall be making collectively.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.336
It is our choice,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.680
and we'd better make it democratically.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.536
Thank you.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.920
(Applause)

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.680
Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.320
It was you who described yourself
in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.920
What is the relevance
of Marx's analysis today?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.336
Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was
any relevance in what I just said,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.576
then Marx is relevant.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.096
Because the whole point of reunifying
the political and economic is --

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.336
if we don't do it,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.616
then technological innovation
is going to create

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.936
such a massive fall in aggregate demand,

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.736
what Larry Summers
refers to as secular stagnation.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.616
With this crisis migrating
from one part of the world,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.176
as it is now,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.896
it will destabilize
not only our democracies,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.136
but even the emerging world that is not
that keen on liberal democracy.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.976
So if this analysis holds water,
then Marx is absolutely relevant.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.736
But so is Hayek,

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.576
that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.816
and so is Keynes,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.736
so that's why I'm totally confused.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.976
(Laughter)

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.056
BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.376
(Laughter)

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.376
(Applause)

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.176
YV: If you are not confused,
you are not thinking, OK?

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.296
BG: That's a very, very Greek
philosopher kind of thing to say --

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.976
YV: That was Einstein, actually --

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.616
BG: During your talk
you mentioned Singapore and China,

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.696
and last night at the speaker dinner,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.896
you expressed a pretty strong opinion
about how the West looks at China.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.496
Would you like to share that?

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.680
YV: Well, there's a great
degree of hypocrisy.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.696
In our liberal democracies,
we have a semblance of democracy.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.456
It's because we have confined,
as I was saying in my talk,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.136
democracy to the political sphere,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.616
while leaving the one sphere
where all the action is --

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.856
the economic sphere --

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.720
a completely democracy-free zone.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.536
In a sense,

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.760
if I am allowed to be provocative,

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.296
China today is closer to Britain
in the 19th century.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.576
Because remember,

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.936
we tend to associate
liberalism with democracy --

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.456
that's a mistake, historically.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.016
Liberalism, liberal,
it's like John Stuart Mill.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.736
John Stuart Mill was particularly
skeptical about the democratic process.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.136
So what you are seeing now in China
is a very similar process

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.336
to the one that we had in Britain
during the Industrial Revolution,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.336
especially the transition
from the first to the second.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.656
And to be castigating China

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.816
for doing that which the West did
in the 19th century,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.160
smacks of hypocrisy.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.176
BG: I am sure that many people here
are wondering about your experience

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.936
as the Finance Minister of Greece
earlier this year.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.341
YV: I knew this was coming.

00:16:17.365 --> 00:16:18.616
BG: Yes.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.976
BG: Six months after,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.400
how do you look back
at the first half of the year?

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.536
YV: Extremely exciting,
from a personal point of view,

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.816
and very disappointing,

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.736
because we had an opportunity
to reboot the Eurozone.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.856
Not just Greece, the Eurozone.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.816
To move away from the complacency

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.296
and the constant denial
that there was a massive --

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.176
and there is a massive
architectural fault line

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.376
going through the Eurozone,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.816
which is threatening, massively,
the whole of the European Union process.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.016
We had an opportunity
on the basis of the Greek program --

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.376
which by the way,

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.776
was the first program
to manifest that denial --

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.016
to put it right.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.256
And, unfortunately,

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.096
the powers in the Eurozone,

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.320
in the Eurogroup,

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.056
chose to maintain denial.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.336
But you know what happens.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.415
This is the experience
of the Soviet Union.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.935
When you try to keep alive

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.839
an economic system
that architecturally cannot survive,

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.175
through political will
and through authoritarianism,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.856
you may succeed in prolonging it,

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.455
but when change happens

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.976
it happens very abruptly
and catastrophically.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.007
BG: What kind of change
are you foreseeing?

00:17:27.031 --> 00:17:28.285
YV: Well, there's no doubt

00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:30.976
that if we don't change
the architecture of the Eurozone,

00:17:31.001 --> 00:17:32.895
the Eurozone has no future.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.816
BG: Did you make any mistakes
when you were Finance Minister?

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.056
YV: Every day.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.616
BG: For example?
YV: Anybody who looks back --

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.720
(Applause)

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.496
No, but seriously.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.096
If there's any Minister of Finance,
or of anything else for that matter,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.336
who tells you after six months in a job,

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.056
especially in such a stressful situation,

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.776
that they have made no mistake,
they're dangerous people.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.096
Of course I made mistakes.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.936
The greatest mistake
was to sign the application

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.056
for the extension of a loan agreement

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.696
in the end of February.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.936
I was imagining

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.936
that there was a genuine interest
on the side of the creditors

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.216
to find common ground.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.456
And there wasn't.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.096
They were simply interested
in crushing our government,

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.576
just because they did not want

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.736
to have to deal with
the architectural fault lines

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.776
that were running through the Eurozone.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.616
And because they didn't want to admit

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.256
that for five years they were implementing
a catastrophic program in Greece.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.176
We lost one-third of our nominal GDP.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.136
This is worse than the Great Depression.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.416
And no one has come clean

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.376
from the troika of lenders
that have been imposing this policy

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.376
to say, "This was a colossal mistake."

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.616
BG: Despite all this,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.976
and despite the aggressiveness
of the discussion,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.416
you seem to be remaining
quite pro-European.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.656
YV: Absolutely.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.816
Look, my criticism
of the European Union and the Eurozone

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.880
comes from a person
who lives and breathes Europe.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.256
My greatest fear is that
the Eurozone will not survive.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.736
Because if it doesn't,

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.616
the centrifugal forces
that will be unleashed

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.336
will be demonic,

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.336
and they will destroy the European Union.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.776
And that will be catastrophic
not just for Europe

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.416
but for the whole global economy.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.536
We are probably the largest
economy in the world.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.296
And if we allow ourselves

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.136
to fall into a route
of the postmodern 1930's,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.816
which seems to me to be what we are doing,

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.656
then that will be detrimental

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.096
to the future of Europeans
and non-Europeans alike.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.536
BG: We definitely hope
you are wrong on that point.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.256
Yanis, thank you for coming to TED.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.496
YV: Thank you.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.343
(Applause)
