WEBVTT

00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:03.898
I'm a marine biologist
and an explorer-photographer

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:05.663
with National Geographic,

00:00:05.687 --> 00:00:07.365
but I want to share a secret.

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:11.436
This image is totally incorrect,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.197
totally incorrect.

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:15.348
I see a couple of people
crying in the back

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:17.816
that I've blown their idea of mermaids.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.491
All right, the mermaid is indeed real,

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:22.650
but anyone who's gone on a dive

00:00:22.674 --> 00:00:25.272
will know that the ocean
looks more like this.

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:29.267
It's because the ocean
is this massive filter,

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:31.364
and as soon as you start going underwater,

00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:33.061
you're going to lose your colors,

00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:36.291
and it's going to get dark
and blue very quickly.

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:39.100
But we're humans --
we're terrestrial mammals.

00:00:39.124 --> 00:00:41.299
And we've got trichromatic vision,

00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:43.989
so we see in red, green and blue,

00:00:44.013 --> 00:00:46.338
and we're just complete color addicts.

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:49.005
We love eye-popping color,

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:51.616
and we try to bring this eye-popping color

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.020
underwater with us.

00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:57.081
So there's been a long and sordid history
of bringing color underwater,

00:00:57.105 --> 00:01:02.051
and it starts 88 years ago
with Bill Longley and Charles Martin,

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:04.996
who were trying to take
the first underwater color photograph.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.735
And they're in there
with old-school scuba suits,

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.884
where you're pumping air down to them,

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:15.498
and they've got a pontoon
of high-explosive magnesium powder,

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:17.729
and the poor people
at the surface are not sure

00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:21.383
when they're going to pull the string
when they've got their frame in focus,

00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:24.331
and -- boom! -- a pound
of high explosives would go off

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.410
so they could put
a little bit of light underwater

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:30.204
and get an image
like this beautiful hogfish.

00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:33.077
I mean, it's a gorgeous image,
but this is not real.

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:35.860
They're creating an artificial environment

00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:39.560
so we can satisfy
our own addiction to color.

00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:43.824
And looking at it the other way,
what we've been finding

00:01:43.848 --> 00:01:47.052
is that instead of bringing color
underwater with us,

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.828
that we've been looking at the blue ocean,

00:01:49.852 --> 00:01:52.114
and it's a crucible of blue,

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:55.234
and these animals living there
for millions of years

00:01:55.258 --> 00:01:59.788
have been evolving all sorts of ways
to take in that blue light

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:01.503
and give off other colors.

00:02:01.527 --> 00:02:04.813
And here's just a little sample
of what this secret world looks like.

00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:06.715
It's like an underwater light show.

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.823
(Music)

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:15.415
Again, what we're seeing here
is blue light hitting this image.

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.528
These animals are absorbing the blue light

00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:20.033
and immediately transforming this light.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.763
So if you think about it, the ocean
is 71 percent of the planet,

00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:31.857
and blue light can extend down
to almost a 1,000 meters.

00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:33.985
As we go down underwater,

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.703
after about 10 meters,
all the red is gone.

00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:39.930
So if you see anything
under 10 meters that's red,

00:02:39.954 --> 00:02:43.012
it's an animal transforming
and creating its own red.

00:02:43.472 --> 00:02:49.725
This is the largest single monochromatic
blue environment on our planet.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.360
And my gateway into this world
of biofluorescence begins with corals.

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:57.470
And I want to give
a full TED Talk on corals

00:02:57.494 --> 00:02:59.296
and just how cool these things are.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.542
One of the things that they do,
one of their miraculous feats,

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:05.344
is they produce lots of these
fluorescent proteins,

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:06.853
fluorescent molecules.

00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:11.624
And in this coral, it could be making
up to 14 percent of its body mass --

00:03:11.648 --> 00:03:13.733
could be this fluorescent protein.

00:03:13.757 --> 00:03:18.186
So you wouldn't be making, like,
14 percent muscle and not using it,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.794
so it's likely doing something
that has a functional role.

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:25.655
And for the last 10, 15 years,
this was so special to me,

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:31.099
because this molecule has turned out
to be one of the most revolutionary tools

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:32.823
in biomedical science,

00:03:32.847 --> 00:03:36.361
and it's allowing us
to better see inside ourselves.

00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:39.805
So, how do I study this?

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.900
In order to study biofluorescence,
we swim at night.

00:03:42.924 --> 00:03:44.302
And when I started out,

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:48.337
I was just using these blue
duct-tape filters over my strobe,

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.740
so I could make sure
I'm actually seeing the light

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:52.796
that's being transformed by the animals.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.297
We're making an exhibit
for the Museum of Natural History,

00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:00.128
and we're trying to show off how great
the fluorescent corals are on the reef,

00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:03.208
and something happened
that just blew me away:

00:04:03.232 --> 00:04:04.621
this.

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:06.461
In the middle of our corals,

00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:09.491
is this green fluorescent fish.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:12.327
It's the first time we've ever seen
a green fluorescent fish

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:13.978
or any vertebrate for that matter.

00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:16.557
And we're rubbing our eyes,
checking the filters,

00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:19.780
thinking that somebody's maybe
playing a joke on us with the camera,

00:04:19.804 --> 00:04:21.747
but the eel was real.

00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:25.310
It was the first green
fluorescent eel that we found,

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:28.293
and this just changed
my trajectory completely.

00:04:28.317 --> 00:04:31.651
So I had to put down my corals and team up

00:04:31.675 --> 00:04:33.708
with a fish scientist, John Sparks,

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.231
and begin a search around the world

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.506
to see how prevalent this phenomenon is.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.005
And fish are much more
interesting than corals,

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:44.243
because they have really advanced vision,

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:48.052
and some of the fish even have,
the way that I was photographing it,

00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:51.512
they have lenses in their eyes
that would magnify the fluorescence.

00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:53.846
So I wanted to seek this out further.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.592
So we designed a new set of gear

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:57.905
and we're scouring the reefs
around the world,

00:04:57.929 --> 00:04:59.508
looking for fluorescent life.

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.587
And it's a bit like "E.T. phone home."

00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:04.320
We're out there swimming
with this blue light,

00:05:04.344 --> 00:05:06.549
and we're looking for a response,

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:10.148
for animals to be absorbing the light
and transferring this back to us.

00:05:10.172 --> 00:05:14.884
And eventually, we found
our photobombing Kaupichphys eel.

00:05:14.908 --> 00:05:19.378
It's a really shy, reclusive eel
that we know almost nothing about.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.363
They're only about the size of my finger,

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:25.867
and they spend about 99.9 percent
of their time hidden under a rock.

00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:30.012
But these eels do come out to mate
under full-moon nights,

00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:33.529
and that full-moon night
translates underwater to blue.

00:05:33.553 --> 00:05:36.083
Perhaps they're using this
as a way to see each other,

00:05:36.107 --> 00:05:37.568
quickly find each other, mate,

00:05:37.592 --> 00:05:41.306
go back into their hole
for the next long stint of time.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.210
But then we started to find
other fluorescent marine life,

00:05:44.234 --> 00:05:47.031
like this green fluorescent bream,

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:51.040
with its, like, racing stripes
along its head and its nape,

00:05:51.064 --> 00:05:55.365
and it's almost camouflaged
and fluorescing at the same intensity

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.175
as the fluorescent coral there.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.277
After this fish,

00:06:00.301 --> 00:06:04.602
we were introduced to this red
fluorescent scorpionfish

00:06:04.626 --> 00:06:06.769
cloaked and hidden on this rock.

00:06:06.793 --> 00:06:10.594
The only time we've ever seen this,
it's either on red fluorescent algae

00:06:10.618 --> 00:06:12.293
or red fluorescent coral.

00:06:12.634 --> 00:06:17.967
Later, we found this stealthy
green fluorescent lizardfish.

00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:20.079
These lizardfish come in many varieties,

00:06:20.103 --> 00:06:23.372
and they look almost exactly alike
under white light.

00:06:23.396 --> 00:06:25.770
But if you look at them
under fluorescent light,

00:06:25.794 --> 00:06:27.195
you see lots of patterns,

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:29.905
you can really see
the differences among them.

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:32.866
And in total -- we just reported
this last year --

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.238
we found over 200 species
of biofluorescent fish.

00:06:38.135 --> 00:06:44.061
One of my inspirations is French artist
and biologist Jean Painlevé.

00:06:44.085 --> 00:06:48.134
He really captures this entrepreneuring,
creative spirit in biology.

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:51.961
He would design his own gear,
make his own cameras,

00:06:51.985 --> 00:06:55.979
and he was fascinated with the seahorse,
Hippocampus erectus,

00:06:56.003 --> 00:06:59.230
and he filmed for the first time
the seahorse giving birth.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.638
So this is the male seahorse.

00:07:01.662 --> 00:07:06.376
They were one of the first fish
to start swimming upright

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.028
with their brain above their head.

00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:09.203
The males give birth,

00:07:09.227 --> 00:07:10.647
just phenomenal creatures.

00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:14.297
So he stayed awake for days.

00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:17.496
He even put this electrical visor
on his head that would shock him,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.112
so he could capture this moment.

00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:22.916
Now, I wish I could have shown Painlevé

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.037
the moment where we found
biofluorescent seahorses

00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:28.760
in the exact same species
that he was studying.

00:07:28.784 --> 00:07:29.998
And here's our footage.

00:07:30.022 --> 00:07:32.849
(Music)

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:35.943
They're the most cryptic fish.

00:07:35.967 --> 00:07:39.347
You could be swimming right on top of them
and not see the seahorse.

00:07:40.228 --> 00:07:44.736
They would blend right into the algae,
which would also fluoresce red,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.221
but they've got great vision,

00:07:46.245 --> 00:07:48.419
and they go through
this long mating ritual,

00:07:48.443 --> 00:07:50.545
and perhaps they're using it
in that effect.

00:07:51.647 --> 00:07:54.566
But things got pretty edgy

00:07:55.442 --> 00:08:00.455
when we found green
fluorescence in the stingray,

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:03.243
because stingrays are
in the Elasmobranch class,

00:08:03.267 --> 00:08:04.506
which includes ...

00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:06.534
sharks.

00:08:06.558 --> 00:08:09.756
So I'm, like, a coral biologist.

00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:13.606
Somebody's got to go down and check
to see if the sharks are fluorescent.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.892
And there I am.

00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:16.314
(Laughter)

00:08:16.338 --> 00:08:18.877
And I was like, "Maybe I should
go back to corals."

00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:19.933
(Laughter)

00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:22.353
It turns out that these sharks
are not fluorescent.

00:08:23.473 --> 00:08:24.889
And then we found it.

00:08:24.913 --> 00:08:29.751
In a deep, dark canyon
off the coast of California,

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:34.212
we found the first
biofluorescent swellshark,

00:08:34.236 --> 00:08:36.011
right underneath all the surfers.

00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:37.220
Here it is.

00:08:37.244 --> 00:08:39.968
They're just about a meter long.
It's called a swellshark.

00:08:39.992 --> 00:08:42.904
And they call them a swellshark
because if they're threatened,

00:08:42.928 --> 00:08:45.674
they can gulp down water
and blow up like an inner tube,

00:08:45.698 --> 00:08:46.857
about twice their size,

00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:51.626
and wedge themselves under a rock,
so they don't get eaten by a predator.

00:08:52.158 --> 00:08:56.301
And here is our first footage
of these biofluorescent swellsharks.

00:08:57.229 --> 00:09:01.950
Just magnificent -- I mean,
they're showing these distinct patterns,

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:05.547
and there are areas that are fluorescent
and areas that are not fluorescent,

00:09:05.571 --> 00:09:08.160
but they've also got these
twinkling spots on them

00:09:08.184 --> 00:09:10.775
that are much brighter
than other parts of the shark.

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:13.326
But this is all beautiful to see.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.980
I was like, this is gorgeous.

00:09:15.004 --> 00:09:17.835
But what does it mean to the shark?

00:09:17.859 --> 00:09:19.206
Can they see this?

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.762
And we looked in the literature,

00:09:20.786 --> 00:09:23.944
and nothing was known
about this shark's vision.

00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:28.150
So I took this shark to eye specialist
Ellis Loew at Cornell University,

00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:31.697
and we found out that this shark
sees discretely and acutely

00:09:31.721 --> 00:09:33.815
in the blue-green interface,

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.669
probably about 100 times better
than we can see in the dark,

00:09:36.693 --> 00:09:38.419
but they only see blue-green.

00:09:38.443 --> 00:09:41.562
So what it's doing
is taking this blue world

00:09:41.586 --> 00:09:44.339
and it's absorbing the blue,
creating green.

00:09:44.363 --> 00:09:47.181
It's creating contrast
that they can indeed see.

00:09:47.205 --> 00:09:48.356
So we have a model,

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.752
showing that it creates an ability
for them to see all these patterns.

00:09:51.776 --> 00:09:54.657
And males and females
also have, we're finding,

00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:56.617
distinct patterns among them.

00:09:57.276 --> 00:10:02.709
But our last find came really just
a few miles from where we are now,

00:10:02.733 --> 00:10:04.184
in the Solomon Islands.

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:08.668
Swimming at night, I encountered
the first biofluorescent sea turtle.

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:12.104
So now it's going from fish
and sharks into reptiles,

00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:15.412
which, again, this is only one month old,

00:10:15.436 --> 00:10:17.814
but it shows us
that we know almost nothing

00:10:17.838 --> 00:10:20.112
about this hawksbill turtle's vision.

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:22.992
And it makes me think about
how much more there is to learn.

00:10:23.016 --> 00:10:24.548
And here in the Solomon Islands,

00:10:24.572 --> 00:10:28.143
there's only a few thousand
breeding females of this species left,

00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:30.211
and this is one of the hotspots for them.

00:10:30.235 --> 00:10:33.302
So it shows us how much we need
to really protect these animals

00:10:33.326 --> 00:10:35.682
while they're still here,
and understand them.

00:10:35.706 --> 00:10:37.850
In thinking about biofluorescence,

00:10:37.874 --> 00:10:39.819
I wanted to know, how deep does it go?

00:10:39.843 --> 00:10:42.287
Does this go all the way
to the bottom of the ocean?

00:10:42.311 --> 00:10:45.858
So we started using submarines,
and we equipped them

00:10:45.882 --> 00:10:48.056
with special blue lights
on the front here.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.040
And we dropped down,

00:10:50.064 --> 00:10:52.781
and we noticed one important thing --

00:10:52.805 --> 00:10:56.103
that as we get down to 1,000 meters,

00:10:56.127 --> 00:10:57.443
it drops off.

00:10:57.467 --> 00:11:01.371
There's no biofluorescent marine life
down there, below 1,000 meters --

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.400
almost nothing, it's just darkness.

00:11:03.424 --> 00:11:05.854
So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.

00:11:05.878 --> 00:11:07.331
And below 1,000 meters,

00:11:07.355 --> 00:11:10.016
we encountered the bioluminescent zone,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.377
where nine out of 10 animals
are actually making their own lights

00:11:13.401 --> 00:11:15.155
and flashing and blinking.

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:16.552
As I try to get deeper,

00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:19.551
this is slapping on a one-person
submarine suit --

00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:23.338
some people call this my "Jacques Cousteau
meets Woody Allen" moment.

00:11:23.362 --> 00:11:24.513
(Laughter)

00:11:24.537 --> 00:11:26.588
But as we explore down here,

00:11:26.612 --> 00:11:30.331
I was thinking about: How do we
interact with life delicately?

00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:33.052
Because we're entering
a new age of exploration,

00:11:33.076 --> 00:11:34.879
where we have to take great care,

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:37.598
and we have to set examples
how we explore.

00:11:37.622 --> 00:11:41.286
So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood
at Harvard University,

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.449
and we've been designing
squishy underwater robot fingers,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.462
so we can delicately interact
with the marine life down there.

00:11:49.486 --> 00:11:54.201
The idea is that most of our technologies
to explore the deep ocean

00:11:54.225 --> 00:11:57.005
come from oil and gas and military,

00:11:57.029 --> 00:11:59.870
who, you know, they're not really
caring to be gentle.

00:11:59.894 --> 00:12:02.577
Some corals could be 1,000 years old.

00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:05.710
You don't want to just go
and crush them with a big claw.

00:12:05.734 --> 00:12:07.732
So my dream is something like this.

00:12:07.756 --> 00:12:10.052
At night, I'm in a submarine,

00:12:10.076 --> 00:12:12.186
I have force-feedback gloves,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.528
and I could delicately set up
a lab in the front of my submarine,

00:12:15.552 --> 00:12:18.091
where the squishy robot fingers

00:12:18.115 --> 00:12:20.600
are delicately collecting
and putting things in jars,

00:12:20.624 --> 00:12:22.209
and we can conduct our research.

00:12:22.607 --> 00:12:25.457
Back to the powerful applied applications.

00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:28.321
Here, you're looking at a living brain

00:12:28.345 --> 00:12:31.712
that's using the DNA
of fluorescent marine creatures,

00:12:31.736 --> 00:12:33.742
this one from jellyfish and corals,

00:12:33.766 --> 00:12:37.235
to illuminate the living brain
and see its connections.

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:38.775
It's funny that we're using RGB

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:41.347
just to kind of satisfy
our own human intuition,

00:12:41.371 --> 00:12:43.705
so we can see our brains better.

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:45.777
And even more mind-blowing,

00:12:45.801 --> 00:12:48.911
is my close colleague
Vincent Pieribone at Yale,

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:52.312
who has actually designed and engineered
a fluorescent protein

00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:54.431
that responds to voltage.

00:12:54.455 --> 00:12:57.557
So he could see
when a single neuron fires.

00:12:57.581 --> 00:13:02.120
You're essentially looking at
a portal into consciousness

00:13:02.144 --> 00:13:05.058
that was designed by marine creatures.

00:13:06.102 --> 00:13:10.788
So this brings me all back
to perspective and relationship.

00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:13.051
From deep space,

00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:16.227
our universe looks
like a human brain cell,

00:13:16.251 --> 00:13:18.733
and then here we are in the deep ocean,

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:21.628
and we're finding
marine creatures and cells

00:13:21.652 --> 00:13:23.931
that can illuminate the human mind.

00:13:23.955 --> 00:13:27.073
And it's my hope
that with illuminated minds,

00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:30.882
we could ponder the overarching
interconnectedness of all life,

00:13:30.906 --> 00:13:33.264
and fathom how much more lies in store

00:13:33.288 --> 00:13:35.003
if we keep our oceans healthy.

00:13:35.027 --> 00:13:36.185
Thank you.

00:13:36.209 --> 00:13:41.325
(Applause)
