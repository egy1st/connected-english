00:00:00.782 --> 00:00:02.687
Imagine you're in Rome,

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:05.914
and you've made your way
to the Vatican Museums.

00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:09.544
And you've been shuffling
down long corridors,

00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:14.008
past statues, frescoes,
lots and lots of stuff.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.725
You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:22.125
At last -- a long corridor,
a stair and a door.

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:25.147
You're at the threshold
of the Sistine Chapel.

00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:26.935
So what are you expecting?

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.483
Soaring domes? Choirs of angels?

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:31.665
We don't really have any of that there.

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.998
Instead, you may ask yourself,
what do we have?

00:00:36.022 --> 00:00:38.646
Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.625
And I mean literally, you're surrounded
by painted curtains,

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.064
the original decoration of this chapel.

00:00:44.088 --> 00:00:48.632
Churches used tapestries not just
to keep out cold during long masses,

00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:52.111
but as a way to represent
the great theater of life.

00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:57.762
The human drama in which each one of us
plays a part is a great story,

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:00.595
a story that encompasses the whole world

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.684
and that came to unfold
in the three stages

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:05.950
of the painting in the Sistine Chapel.

00:01:06.382 --> 00:01:09.743
Now, this building started out
as a space for a small group

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:12.109
of wealthy, educated Christian priests.

00:01:12.528 --> 00:01:15.205
They prayed there.
They elected their pope there.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.381
Five hundred years ago,

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:18.912
it was the ultimate
ecclesiastical man cave.

00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:25.419
So, you may ask, how can it be
that today it attracts and delights

00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:28.109
five million people a year,

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.372
from all different backgrounds?

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:34.932
Because in that compressed space,
there was a creative explosion,

00:01:34.956 --> 00:01:39.788
ignited by the electric excitement
of new geopolitical frontiers,

00:01:39.812 --> 00:01:44.107
which set on fire the ancient
missionary tradition of the Church

00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.409
and produced one of the greatest
works of art in history.

00:01:48.064 --> 00:01:52.578
Now, this development took place
as a great evolution,

00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:55.337
moving from the beginning of a few elite,

00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:58.792
and eventually able to speak
to audiences of people

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:00.838
that come from all over the world.

00:02:01.222 --> 00:02:03.976
This evolution took place in three stages,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.111
each one linked
to a historical circumstance.

00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:09.166
The first one was rather limited in scope.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.723
It reflected the rather
parochial perspective.

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:16.350
The second one took place after
worldviews were dramatically altered

00:02:16.374 --> 00:02:19.065
after Columbus's historical voyage;

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.496
and the third,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.496
when the Age of Discovery
was well under way

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.029
and the Church rose to the challenge

00:02:26.053 --> 00:02:27.456
of going global.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.342
The original decoration of this church
reflected a smaller world.

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:33.680
There were busy scenes

00:02:33.704 --> 00:02:37.561
that told the stories of the lives
of Jesus and Moses,

00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:41.622
reflecting the development
of the Jewish and Christian people.

00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:43.983
The man who commissioned this,
Pope Sixtus IV,

00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:47.326
assembled a dream team of Florentine art,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.249
including men like Sandro Botticelli

00:02:50.273 --> 00:02:53.850
and the man who would become
Michelangelo's future painting teacher,

00:02:53.874 --> 00:02:55.412
Ghirlandaio.

00:02:55.436 --> 00:03:00.781
These men, they blanketed the walls
with a frieze of pure color,

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:04.106
and in these stories you'll notice
familiar landscapes,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.996
the artists using Roman monuments
or a Tuscan landscape

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.448
to render a faraway story,
something much more familiar.

00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:15.117
With the addition of images
of the Pope's friends and family,

00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:17.974
this was a perfect decoration
for a small court

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:19.767
limited to the European continent.

00:03:20.244 --> 00:03:25.114
But in 1492, the New World was discovered,

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:27.082
horizons were expanding,

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:33.462
and this little 133 by 46-foot
microcosm had to expand as well.

00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:34.806
And it did,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.782
thanks to a creative genius,

00:03:36.806 --> 00:03:39.623
a visionary and an awesome story.

00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:42.757
Now, the creative genius
was Michelangelo Buonarroti,

00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:47.171
33 years old when he was tapped
to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling,

00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:49.076
and the deck was stacked against him --

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.996
he had trained in painting
but had left to pursue sculpture.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.478
There were angry patrons in Florence
because he had left a stack

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:57.176
of incomplete commissions,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.863
lured to Rome by the prospect
of a great sculptural project,

00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:03.468
and that project had fallen through.

00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:06.621
And he had been left with a commission
to paint 12 apostles

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:09.566
against a decorative background
in the Sistine Chapel ceiling,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.128
which would look like
every other ceiling in Italy.

00:04:13.615 --> 00:04:15.446
But genius rose to the challenge.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.968
In an age when a man dared
to sail across the Atlantic Ocean,

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:22.520
Michelangelo dared to chart
new artistic waters.

00:04:23.027 --> 00:04:25.263
He, too, would tell a story --

00:04:25.287 --> 00:04:28.819
no Apostles -- but a story
of great beginnings,

00:04:28.843 --> 00:04:30.515
the story of Genesis.

00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:34.018
Not really an easy sell,
stories on a ceiling.

00:04:34.042 --> 00:04:38.850
How would you be able to read
a busy scene from 62 feet below?

00:04:38.874 --> 00:04:41.729
The painting technique that had been
handed on for 200 years

00:04:41.753 --> 00:04:45.067
in Florentine studios was not equipped
for this kind of a narrative.

00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:48.662
But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter,

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:50.970
and so he played to his strengths.

00:04:50.994 --> 00:04:54.476
Instead of being accustomed
to filling space with busyness,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.299
he took a hammer and chisel
and hacked away at a piece of marble

00:04:58.323 --> 00:05:00.753
to reveal the figure within.

00:05:00.777 --> 00:05:02.945
Michelangelo was an essentialist;

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.355
he would tell his story
in massive, dynamic bodies.

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:12.146
This plan was embraced
by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.791
a man who was unafraid
of Michelangelo's brazen genius.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.697
He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,

00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:21.828
and he had been steeped in art
for 30 years and he knew its power.

00:05:21.852 --> 00:05:24.916
And history has handed down the moniker
of the Warrior Pope,

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.730
but this man's legacy to the Vatican --
it wasn't fortresses and artillery,

00:05:28.754 --> 00:05:30.070
it was art.

00:05:30.094 --> 00:05:32.673
He left us the Raphael Rooms,
the Sistine Chapel.

00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:34.342
He left St. Peter's Basilica

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:40.069
as well as an extraordinary collection
of Greco-Roman sculptures --

00:05:40.093 --> 00:05:44.233
decidedly un-Christian works
that would become the seedbed

00:05:44.257 --> 00:05:48.142
of the world's first modern museum,
the Vatican Museums.

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:50.271
Julius was a man

00:05:50.295 --> 00:05:54.079
who envisioned a Vatican
that would be eternally relevant

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:56.192
through grandeur and through beauty,

00:05:56.216 --> 00:05:57.588
and he was right.

00:05:57.612 --> 00:06:02.600
The encounter between these two giants,
Michelangelo and Julius II,

00:06:02.624 --> 00:06:05.061
that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.

00:06:05.641 --> 00:06:08.428
Michelangelo was so committed
to this project,

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:12.835
that he succeeded in getting the job done
in three and a half years,

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:17.128
using a skeleton crew and spending
most of the time, hours on end,

00:06:17.152 --> 00:06:20.843
reaching up above his head
to paint the stories on the ceiling.

00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:23.474
So let's look at this ceiling

00:06:23.498 --> 00:06:26.329
and see storytelling gone global.

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:30.765
No more familiar artistic references
to the world around you.

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.432
There's just space
and structure and energy;

00:06:35.456 --> 00:06:40.053
a monumental painted framework
which opens onto nine panels,

00:06:40.077 --> 00:06:44.010
more driven by sculptural form
than painterly color.

00:06:44.034 --> 00:06:47.811
And we stand in the far end
by the entrance,

00:06:47.835 --> 00:06:51.941
far from the altar and from the gated
enclosure intended for the clergy

00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:57.212
and we peer into the distance,
looking for a beginning.

00:06:57.236 --> 00:07:01.252
And whether in scientific inquiry
or in biblical tradition,

00:07:01.276 --> 00:07:04.596
we think in terms of a primal spark.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.753
Michelangelo gave us an initial energy

00:07:06.777 --> 00:07:09.518
when he gave us the separation
of light and dark,

00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:12.931
a churning figure blurry in the distance,

00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:15.439
compressed into a tight space.

00:07:15.463 --> 00:07:17.792
The next figure looms larger,

00:07:17.816 --> 00:07:21.243
and you see a figure hurtling
from one side to the next.

00:07:21.267 --> 00:07:26.253
He leaves in his wake
the sun, the moon, vegetation.

00:07:26.277 --> 00:07:30.284
Michelangelo didn't focus
on the stuff that was being created,

00:07:30.308 --> 00:07:32.352
unlike all the other artists.

00:07:32.376 --> 00:07:35.719
He focused on the act of creation.

00:07:35.743 --> 00:07:40.117
And then the movement stops,
like a caesura in poetry

00:07:40.141 --> 00:07:41.393
and the creator hovers.

00:07:41.417 --> 00:07:42.696
So what's he doing?

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.575
Is he creating land? Is he creating sea?

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:50.290
Or is he looking back over his handiwork,
the universe and his treasures,

00:07:50.314 --> 00:07:52.045
just like Michelangelo must have,

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:54.666
looking back over his work in the ceiling

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.484
and proclaiming, "It is good."

00:07:58.388 --> 00:08:00.493
So now the scene is set,

00:08:00.517 --> 00:08:04.195
and you get to the culmination
of creation, which is man.

00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:08.549
Adam leaps to the eye, a light figure
against a dark background.

00:08:08.573 --> 00:08:10.331
But looking closer,

00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:13.007
that leg is pretty languid on the ground,

00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:15.321
the arm is heavy on the knee.

00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:19.022
Adam lacks that interior spark

00:08:19.046 --> 00:08:21.334
that will impel him to greatness.

00:08:21.358 --> 00:08:26.123
That spark is about to be conferred
by the creator in that finger,

00:08:26.147 --> 00:08:28.818
which is one millimeter
from the hand of Adam.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.787
It puts us at the edge of our seats,

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:33.826
because we're one moment
from that contact,

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.751
through which that man
will discover his purpose,

00:08:36.775 --> 00:08:39.759
leap up and take his place
at the pinnacle of creation.

00:08:39.783 --> 00:08:43.044
And then Michelangelo threw a curveball.

00:08:43.068 --> 00:08:44.896
Who is in that other arm?

00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:47.227
Eve, first woman.

00:08:47.251 --> 00:08:50.160
No, she's not an afterthought.
She's part of the plan.

00:08:50.184 --> 00:08:52.657
She's always been in his mind.

00:08:52.681 --> 00:08:56.886
Look at her, so intimate with God
that her hand curls around his arm.

00:08:57.329 --> 00:09:02.737
And for me, an American art historian
from the 21st century,

00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:05.613
this was the moment
that the painting spoke to me.

00:09:05.637 --> 00:09:08.985
Because I realized that this
representation of the human drama

00:09:09.009 --> 00:09:11.922
was always about men and women --

00:09:11.946 --> 00:09:15.736
so much so, that the dead center,
the heart of the ceiling,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.174
is the creation of woman, not Adam.

00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:22.122
And the fact is, that when you see them
together in the Garden of Eden,

00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:23.683
they fall together

00:09:23.707 --> 00:09:28.099
and together their proud posture
turns into folded shame.

00:09:28.647 --> 00:09:31.316
You are at critical juncture
now in the ceiling.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.423
You are exactly at the point
where you and I can go

00:09:34.447 --> 00:09:35.902
no further into the church.

00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:39.282
The gated enclosure keeps us
out of the inner sanctum,

00:09:39.306 --> 00:09:41.819
and we are cast out
much like Adam and Eve.

00:09:41.843 --> 00:09:43.599
The remaining scenes in the ceiling,

00:09:43.623 --> 00:09:46.467
they mirror the crowded chaos
of the world around us.

00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:48.715
You have Noah and his Ark and the flood.

00:09:48.739 --> 00:09:52.329
You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice
and a covenant with God.

00:09:52.353 --> 00:09:53.639
Maybe he's the savior.

00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:57.763
Oh, but no, Noah is the one
who grew grapes, invented wine,

00:09:57.787 --> 00:09:59.945
got drunk and passed out
naked in his barn.

00:10:00.385 --> 00:10:02.759
It is a curious way to design the ceiling,

00:10:02.783 --> 00:10:04.707
now starting out with God creating life,

00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:07.226
ending up with some guy
blind drunk in a barn.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.706
And so, compared with Adam,

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.248
you might think Michelangelo
is making fun of us.

00:10:12.693 --> 00:10:14.736
But he's about to dispel the gloom

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.278
by using those bright colors
right underneath Noah:

00:10:18.302 --> 00:10:21.692
emerald, topaz, scarlet
on the prophet Zechariah.

00:10:21.716 --> 00:10:24.695
Zechariah foresees a light
coming from the east,

00:10:24.719 --> 00:10:28.407
and we are turned at this juncture
to a new destination,

00:10:28.431 --> 00:10:32.306
with sibyls and prophets
who will lead us on a parade.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.628
You have the heroes and heroines
who make safe the way,

00:10:35.652 --> 00:10:38.136
and we follow the mothers and fathers.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.245
They are the motors of this great
human engine, driving it forward.

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:45.176
And now we're at the keystone
of the ceiling,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.379
the culmination of the whole thing,

00:10:47.403 --> 00:10:50.633
with a figure that looks like
he's about to fall out of his space

00:10:50.657 --> 00:10:51.997
into our space,

00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:53.304
encroaching our space.

00:10:53.328 --> 00:10:55.869
This is the most important juncture.

00:10:55.893 --> 00:10:57.765
Past meets present.

00:10:57.789 --> 00:11:01.005
This figure, Jonah, who spent
three days in the belly of the whale,

00:11:01.029 --> 00:11:03.882
for the Christians, is the symbol
of the renewal of humanity

00:11:03.906 --> 00:11:05.169
through Jesus' sacrifice,

00:11:05.193 --> 00:11:07.941
but for the multitudes
of visitors to that museum

00:11:07.965 --> 00:11:10.735
from all faiths who visit there every day,

00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:17.345
he is the moment the distant past
encounters and meets immediate reality.

00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:22.684
All of this brings us to the yawning
archway of the altar wall,

00:11:22.708 --> 00:11:25.471
where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment,

00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:29.361
painted in 1534 after the world
had changed again.

00:11:29.385 --> 00:11:31.409
The Reformation had splintered the Church,

00:11:31.433 --> 00:11:34.301
the Ottoman Empire had made
Islam a household word

00:11:34.325 --> 00:11:37.819
and Magellan had found a route
into the Pacific Ocean.

00:11:37.843 --> 00:11:42.505
How is a 59-year-old artist who has never
been any further than Venice

00:11:42.529 --> 00:11:44.723
going to speak to this new world?

00:11:44.747 --> 00:11:47.790
Michelangelo chose to paint destiny,

00:11:47.814 --> 00:11:49.634
that universal desire,

00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:51.278
common to all of us,

00:11:51.302 --> 00:11:54.471
to leave a legacy of excellence.

00:11:54.495 --> 00:11:57.426
Told in terms of the Christian vision
of the Last Judgment,

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.762
the end of the world,

00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:01.924
Michelangelo gave you a series of figures

00:12:01.948 --> 00:12:05.103
who are wearing these
strikingly beautiful bodies.

00:12:05.127 --> 00:12:07.849
They have no more covers,
no more portraits

00:12:07.873 --> 00:12:09.110
except for a couple.

00:12:09.134 --> 00:12:11.852
It's a composition only out of bodies,

00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:15.262
391, no two alike,

00:12:15.286 --> 00:12:17.740
unique like each and every one of us.

00:12:17.764 --> 00:12:21.506
They start in the lower corner,
breaking away from the ground,

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.252
struggling and trying to rise.

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:26.732
Those who have risen
reach back to help others,

00:12:26.756 --> 00:12:28.593
and in one amazing vignette,

00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:31.709
you have a black man and a white man
pulled up together

00:12:31.733 --> 00:12:34.455
in an incredible vision of human unity

00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:35.921
in this new world.

00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:39.452
The lion's share of the space
goes to the winner's circle.

00:12:39.476 --> 00:12:44.312
There you find men and women
completely nude like athletes.

00:12:44.336 --> 00:12:46.648
They are the ones
who have overcome adversity,

00:12:46.672 --> 00:12:50.386
and Michelangelo's vision
of people who combat adversity,

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.684
overcome obstacles --

00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:53.602
they're just like athletes.

00:12:53.626 --> 00:12:57.055
So you have men and women
flexing and posing

00:12:57.079 --> 00:12:59.163
in this extraordinary spotlight.

00:12:59.555 --> 00:13:02.100
Presiding over this assembly is Jesus,

00:13:02.124 --> 00:13:04.142
first a suffering man on the cross,

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:06.570
now a glorious ruler in Heaven.

00:13:06.594 --> 00:13:09.612
And as Michelangelo
proved in his painting,

00:13:09.636 --> 00:13:12.214
hardship, setbacks and obstacles,

00:13:12.238 --> 00:13:15.472
they don't limit excellence,
they forge it.

00:13:16.276 --> 00:13:18.864
Now, this does lead us to one odd thing.

00:13:18.888 --> 00:13:20.705
This is the Pope's private chapel,

00:13:20.729 --> 00:13:23.886
and the best way you can describe that
is indeed a stew of nudes.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.673
But Michelangelo was trying to use
only the best artistic language,

00:13:27.697 --> 00:13:30.285
the most universal artistic language
he could think of:

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.069
that of the human body.

00:13:32.093 --> 00:13:37.899
And so instead of the way of showing
virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery,

00:13:37.923 --> 00:13:42.188
he borrowed from Julius II's
wonderful collection of sculptures

00:13:42.212 --> 00:13:46.463
in order to show inner strength
as external power.

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:50.733
Now, one contemporary did write

00:13:50.757 --> 00:13:54.615
that the chapel was too beautiful
to not cause controversy.

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:55.988
And so it did.

00:13:56.012 --> 00:13:59.550
Michelangelo soon found
that thanks to the printing press,

00:13:59.574 --> 00:14:02.696
complaints about the nudity
spread all over the place,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.016
and soon his masterpiece of human drama
was labeled pornography,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.215
at which point he added
two more portraits,

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:11.723
one of the man who criticized him,
a papal courtier,

00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:15.879
and the other one of himself
as a dried up husk, no athlete,

00:14:15.903 --> 00:14:18.324
in the hands of a long-suffering martyr.

00:14:18.348 --> 00:14:22.016
The year he died he saw
several of these figures covered over,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.659
a triumph for trivial distractions
over his great exhortation to glory.

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.931
And so now we stand

00:14:29.955 --> 00:14:31.685
in the here and now.

00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:34.029
We are caught in that space

00:14:34.053 --> 00:14:36.318
between beginnings and endings,

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:40.574
in the great, huge totality
of the human experience.

00:14:40.598 --> 00:14:44.569
The Sistine Chapel forces us
to look around as if it were a mirror.

00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:45.890
Who am I in this picture?

00:14:45.914 --> 00:14:47.220
Am I one of the crowd?

00:14:47.244 --> 00:14:48.617
Am I the drunk guy?

00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:50.097
Am I the athlete?

00:14:50.121 --> 00:14:52.381
And as we leave this haven
of uplifting beauty,

00:14:52.405 --> 00:14:56.349
we are inspired to ask ourselves
life's biggest questions:

00:14:56.373 --> 00:15:01.211
Who am I, and what role do I play
in this great theater of life?

00:15:01.549 --> 00:15:02.720
Thank you.

00:15:02.744 --> 00:15:06.192
(Applause)

00:15:06.216 --> 00:15:09.187
Bruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.

00:15:09.211 --> 00:15:13.067
Elizabeth, you mentioned
this whole issue of pornography,

00:15:13.091 --> 00:15:17.904
too many nudes and too many
daily life scenes and improper things

00:15:18.555 --> 00:15:20.420
in the eyes of the time.

00:15:20.444 --> 00:15:22.050
But actually the story is bigger.

00:15:22.074 --> 00:15:25.094
It's not just touching up
and covering up some of the figures.

00:15:25.118 --> 00:15:27.742
This work of art was almost
destroyed because of that.

00:15:28.383 --> 00:15:31.408
Elizabeth Lev: The effect
of the Last Judgment was enormous.

00:15:31.432 --> 00:15:34.382
The printing press made sure
that everybody saw it.

00:15:34.406 --> 00:15:37.691
And so, this wasn't something
that happened within a couple of weeks.

00:15:37.715 --> 00:15:42.183
It was something that happened
over the space of 20 years

00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:44.131
of editorials and complaints,

00:15:44.155 --> 00:15:45.323
saying to the Church,

00:15:45.347 --> 00:15:47.922
"You can't possibly tell us
how to live our lives.

00:15:47.946 --> 00:15:51.286
Did you notice you have
pornography in the Pope's chapel?"

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.770
And so after complaints and insistence

00:15:53.794 --> 00:15:56.510
of trying to get this work destroyed,

00:15:56.534 --> 00:15:58.695
it was finally the year
that Michelangelo died

00:15:58.719 --> 00:16:00.800
that the Church finally
found a compromise,

00:16:00.824 --> 00:16:02.355
a way to save the painting,

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:05.696
and that was in putting up
these extra 30 covers,

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.467
and that happens to be
the origin of fig-leafing.

00:16:08.491 --> 00:16:10.079
That's where it all came about,

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:14.233
and it came about from a church
that was trying to save a work of art,

00:16:14.257 --> 00:16:16.428
not indeed deface or destroyed it.

00:16:16.888 --> 00:16:19.675
BG: This, what you just gave us,
is not the classic tour

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:22.673
that people get today
when they go to the Sistine Chapel.

00:16:22.697 --> 00:16:24.800
(Laughter)

00:16:24.824 --> 00:16:26.605
EL: I don't know, is that an ad?

00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:28.306
(Laughter)

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.318
BG: No, no, no, not necessarily,
it is a statement.

00:16:31.342 --> 00:16:35.256
The experience of art today
is encountering problems.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.155
Too many people want to see this there,

00:16:38.179 --> 00:16:41.306
and the result is five million people
going through that tiny door

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.647
and experiencing it
in a completely different way

00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:44.837
than we just did.

00:16:44.861 --> 00:16:48.390
EL: Right. I agree. I think it's really
nice to be able to pause and look.

00:16:48.414 --> 00:16:50.715
But also realize,
even when you're in those days,

00:16:50.739 --> 00:16:52.751
with 28,000 people a day,

00:16:52.775 --> 00:16:55.885
even those days when you're in there
with all those other people,

00:16:55.909 --> 00:16:58.314
look around you and think
how amazing it is

00:16:58.338 --> 00:17:01.934
that some painted plaster
from 500 years ago

00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:05.066
can still draw all those people
standing side by side with you,

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.065
looking upwards with their jaws dropped.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:12.014
It's a great statement about how beauty
truly can speak to us all

00:17:12.038 --> 00:17:14.725
through time and through geographic space.

00:17:14.749 --> 00:17:15.943
BG: Liz, grazie.

00:17:15.967 --> 00:17:17.174
EL: Grazie a te.

00:17:17.198 --> 00:17:18.374
BG: Thank you.

00:17:18.398 --> 00:17:20.261
(Applause)
