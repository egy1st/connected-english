00:00:01.424 --> 00:00:04.582
It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:08.924
I was working at the ACLU
as the organization's science advisor.

00:00:09.388 --> 00:00:11.995
I really, really loved my job,

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.655
but I was having one of those days

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.248
where I was feeling
just a little bit discouraged.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:21.369
So I wandered down the hallway
to my colleague Chris Hansen's office.

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:26.021
Chris had been at the ACLU
for more than 30 years,

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:29.120
so he had deep institutional
knowledge and insights.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.613
I explained to Chris
that I was feeling a little bit stuck.

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:35.694
I had been investigating
a number of issues

00:00:35.718 --> 00:00:41.019
at the intersection of science
and civil liberties -- super interesting.

00:00:41.043 --> 00:00:44.953
But I wanted the ACLU to engage
these issues in a much bigger way,

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:47.222
in a way that could really
make a difference.

00:00:49.603 --> 00:00:51.703
So Chris cut right
to the chase, and he says,

00:00:51.727 --> 00:00:55.187
"Well, of all the issues you've been
looking at, what are the top five?"

00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:58.180
"Well, there's genetic discrimination,

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:00.629
and reproductive technologies,

00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:02.794
and biobanking, and ...

00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:04.660
oh, there's this really cool issue,

00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:07.333
functional MRI and using it
for lie detection, and ...

00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:09.478
oh, and of course, there's gene patents."

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.131
"Gene patents?"

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:14.049
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.579
"No!

00:01:15.603 --> 00:01:18.064
You're telling me that the US government

00:01:18.088 --> 00:01:21.012
has been issuing patents
on part of the human body?

00:01:21.543 --> 00:01:23.226
That can't be right."

00:01:23.861 --> 00:01:27.320
I went back to my office
and sent Chris three articles.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:31.281
And 20 minutes later,
he came bursting in my office.

00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:34.921
"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?"

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.839
(Laughter)

00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:40.087
Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer,

00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:43.020
but he knew almost nothing
about patent law

00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:45.480
and certainly nothing about genetics.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:48.382
I knew something about genetics,
but I wasn't even a lawyer,

00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:50.067
let alone a patent lawyer.

00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:53.557
So clearly we had a lot to learn
before we could file a lawsuit.

00:01:54.036 --> 00:01:56.894
First, we needed to understand
exactly what was patented

00:01:56.918 --> 00:01:58.599
when someone patented a gene.

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.501
Gene patents typically contain
dozens of claims,

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:08.302
but the most controversial of these
are to so-called "isolated DNA" --

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:13.140
namely, a piece of DNA
that has been removed from a cell.

00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:15.372
Gene patent proponents say,

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:18.570
"See? We didn't patent
the gene in your body,

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:20.529
we patented an isolated gene."

00:02:21.148 --> 00:02:22.349
And that's true,

00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:29.106
but the problem is that any use
of the gene requires that it be isolated.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.915
And the patents weren't just
to a particular gene that they isolated,

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.826
but on every possible
version of that gene.

00:02:38.183 --> 00:02:39.520
So what does that mean?

00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:43.043
That means that you can't give
your gene to your doctor

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:45.363
and ask him or her to look at it,

00:02:45.387 --> 00:02:47.487
say, to see if it has any mutations,

00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:49.587
without permission of the patent holder.

00:02:50.363 --> 00:02:54.556
It also means that the patent holder
has the right to stop anyone

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.062
from using that gene
in research or clinical testing.

00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:00.569
Allowing patent holders,

00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:01.877
often private companies,

00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:06.387
to lock up stretches of the human genome
was harming patients.

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.110
Consider Abigail,

00:03:08.134 --> 00:03:10.527
a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome,

00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:13.975
a serious heart condition that,
if left untreated,

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.777
can result in sudden death.

00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:20.833
The company that obtained a patent on two
genes associated with this condition

00:03:20.857 --> 00:03:23.339
developed a test to diagnose the syndrome.

00:03:23.363 --> 00:03:26.187
But then they went bankrupt
and they never offered it.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.988
So another lab tried to offer the test,

00:03:29.012 --> 00:03:32.000
but the company that held the patents
threatened to sue the lab

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:33.206
for patent infringement.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.389
So as a result,

00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:37.275
for 2 years, no test was available.

00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:39.441
During that time,

00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:42.715
Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT.

00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:47.013
Gene patents clearly were a problem
and were harming patients.

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:49.873
But was there a way
we could challenge them?

00:03:50.266 --> 00:03:51.998
Turns out that the Supreme Court

00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:55.136
has made clear
through a long line of cases,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.946
that certain things
are not patent eligible.

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:01.299
You can't patent products of nature --

00:04:02.148 --> 00:04:06.357
the air, the water, minerals,
elements of the periodic table.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.282
And you can't patent laws of nature --

00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:12.472
the law of gravity, E = mc2.

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.715
These things are just too fundamental
and must remain free to all

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.562
and reserved exclusively to none.

00:04:20.348 --> 00:04:22.495
It seemed to us that DNA,

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:25.035
the most fundamental structure of life,

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:27.715
that codes for the production
of all of our proteins,

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:30.965
is both a product of nature
and a law of nature,

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:33.691
regardless of whether it's in our bodies

00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:35.753
or sitting in the bottom of a test tube.

00:04:36.523 --> 00:04:37.978
As we delved into this issue,

00:04:38.002 --> 00:04:41.910
we traveled all over the country
to speak with many different experts --

00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:46.301
scientists, medical professionals,
lawyers, patent lawyers.

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:50.663
Most of them agreed that we were right
as a matter of policy,

00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:53.472
and, at least in theory,
as a matter of law.

00:04:54.313 --> 00:04:55.468
All of them thought

00:04:55.492 --> 00:04:58.062
our chances of winning
a gene-patent challenge

00:04:58.086 --> 00:04:59.953
were about zero.

00:05:01.628 --> 00:05:02.991
Why is that?

00:05:03.015 --> 00:05:06.102
Well, the patent office
had been issuing these patents

00:05:06.126 --> 00:05:07.827
for more than 20 years.

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:11.566
There were literally thousands
of patents on human genes.

00:05:12.843 --> 00:05:15.784
The patent bar was deeply
entrenched in the status quo,

00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:20.204
the biotech industry had grown up
around this practice,

00:05:20.228 --> 00:05:23.347
and legislation to ban gene patents
had been introduced

00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:24.769
year after year in Congress,

00:05:24.793 --> 00:05:26.584
and had gone absolutely nowhere.

00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:28.615
So the bottom line:

00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:32.202
courts just weren't going to be willing
to overturn these patents.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:37.511
Now, neither Chris nor I were the type
to shy away from a challenge,

00:05:37.535 --> 00:05:40.679
and hearing, "Being right
just isn't enough,"

00:05:40.703 --> 00:05:43.233
seemed all the more reason
to take on this fight.

00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:46.246
So we set out to build our case.

00:05:47.494 --> 00:05:50.984
Now, patent cases tend to be:
Company A sues Company B

00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:54.191
over some really narrow,
obscure technical issue.

00:05:54.822 --> 00:05:57.187
We weren't really interested
in that kind of case,

00:05:57.211 --> 00:05:59.600
and we thought this case
was much bigger than that.

00:05:59.624 --> 00:06:02.112
This was about scientific freedom,
medical progress,

00:06:02.136 --> 00:06:03.595
the rights of patients.

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:06.722
So we decided we were going
to develop a case

00:06:06.746 --> 00:06:09.264
that was not like
your typical patent case --

00:06:09.645 --> 00:06:11.527
more like a civil rights case.

00:06:12.756 --> 00:06:15.598
We set out to identify
a gene-patent holder

00:06:15.622 --> 00:06:18.407
that was vigorously enforcing its patents

00:06:18.431 --> 00:06:21.725
and then to organize a broad coalition
of plaintiffs and experts

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:23.639
that could tell the court

00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:28.052
about all the ways that these patents
were harming patients and innovation.

00:06:29.404 --> 00:06:32.526
We found the prime candidate
to sue in Myriad Genetics,

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.405
a company that's based
in Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:38.968
Myriad held patents on two genes,

00:06:38.992 --> 00:06:42.313
the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.884
Women with certain mutations
along these genes

00:06:45.908 --> 00:06:48.534
are considered to be
at a significantly increased risk

00:06:48.558 --> 00:06:50.503
of developing breast and ovarian cancer.

00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:53.714
Myriad had used its patents to maintain

00:06:53.738 --> 00:06:57.947
a complete monopoly on BRCA testing
in the United States.

00:06:58.544 --> 00:07:02.732
It had forced multiple labs
that were offering BRCA testing to stop.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.915
It charged a lot of money for its test --

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:06.622
over 3,000 dollars.

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:09.424
It had stopped sharing its clinical data

00:07:09.448 --> 00:07:11.735
with the international
scientific community.

00:07:12.522 --> 00:07:14.425
And perhaps worst of all,

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:16.885
for a period of several years,

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:20.622
Myriad refused to update its test
to include additional mutations

00:07:20.646 --> 00:07:24.267
that had been identified
by a team of researchers in France.

00:07:24.974 --> 00:07:27.482
It has been estimated
that during that period,

00:07:27.506 --> 00:07:28.879
for several years,

00:07:28.903 --> 00:07:32.655
as many as 12 percent of women
undergoing testing

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:35.081
received the wrong answer --

00:07:36.377 --> 00:07:40.146
a negative test result
that should have been positive.

00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:43.226
This is Kathleen Maxian.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:47.429
Kathleen's sister Eileen
developed breast cancer at age 40

00:07:47.453 --> 00:07:49.293
and she was tested by Myriad.

00:07:50.032 --> 00:07:51.758
The test was negative.

00:07:51.782 --> 00:07:53.308
The family was relieved.

00:07:53.332 --> 00:07:57.120
That meant that Eileen's cancer
most likely didn't run in the family,

00:07:57.144 --> 00:08:00.159
and that other members of her family
didn't need to be tested.

00:08:00.843 --> 00:08:02.073
But two years later,

00:08:02.097 --> 00:08:06.157
Kathleen was diagnosed
with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.

00:08:06.927 --> 00:08:10.799
It turned out that Kathleen's sister
was among the 12 percent

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:13.692
who received a false-negative test result.

00:08:14.347 --> 00:08:17.436
Had Eileen received the proper result,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.833
Kathleen would have then been tested,

00:08:19.857 --> 00:08:22.770
and her ovarian cancer
could have been prevented.

00:08:24.818 --> 00:08:26.082
Once we settled on Myriad,

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:29.991
we then had to form a coalition
of plaintiffs and experts

00:08:30.015 --> 00:08:32.103
that could illuminate these problems.

00:08:32.127 --> 00:08:34.699
We ended up with 20
highly committed plaintiffs:

00:08:35.325 --> 00:08:36.863
genetic counselors,

00:08:36.887 --> 00:08:40.246
geneticists who had received
cease and desist letters,

00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:42.754
advocacy organizations,

00:08:43.532 --> 00:08:46.597
four major scientific organizations
that collectively represented

00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:50.151
more than 150,000 scientists
and medical professionals,

00:08:50.755 --> 00:08:54.052
and individual women who either
couldn't afford Myriad's test,

00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:57.080
or who wanted to obtain
a second opinion but could not,

00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:58.848
as a result of the patents.

00:09:00.315 --> 00:09:03.755
One of the major challenges
we had in preparing the case

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:06.645
was figuring out how best
to communicate the science.

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:10.910
So in order to argue that what Myriad did
was not an invention,

00:09:10.934 --> 00:09:14.211
and that isolated BRCA genes
were products of nature,

00:09:15.124 --> 00:09:17.837
we had to explain a couple
of basic concepts, like:

00:09:17.861 --> 00:09:20.005
What's a gene? What's DNA?

00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:23.745
How is DNA isolated,
and why isn't that an invention?

00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:29.030
We spent hours and hours
with our plaintiffs and experts,

00:09:29.054 --> 00:09:31.990
trying to come up with ways
of explaining these concepts

00:09:32.014 --> 00:09:33.557
simply yet accurately.

00:09:34.306 --> 00:09:37.638
And we ended up relying heavily
on the use of metaphors,

00:09:37.662 --> 00:09:38.818
like gold.

00:09:39.789 --> 00:09:42.073
So isolating DNA --

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:44.597
it's like extracting gold from a mountain

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:47.121
or taking it out of a stream bed.

00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:50.819
You might be able to patent
the process for mining the gold,

00:09:50.843 --> 00:09:52.924
but you can't patent the gold itself.

00:09:53.929 --> 00:09:56.672
It might've taken a lot
of hard work and effort

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:58.556
to dig the gold out of the mountain;

00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:01.408
you still can't patent it,
it's still gold.

00:10:01.432 --> 00:10:03.188
And the gold, once it's extracted,

00:10:03.212 --> 00:10:05.300
can clearly be used
for all sorts of things

00:10:05.324 --> 00:10:08.060
that it couldn't be used
for when it was in the mountain;

00:10:08.084 --> 00:10:10.266
you can make jewelry
out of it for example --

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.455
still can't patent the gold,
it's still gold.

00:10:13.364 --> 00:10:17.218
So now it's 2009,
and we're ready to file our case.

00:10:18.286 --> 00:10:21.781
We filed in federal court
in the Southern District of New York,

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:25.721
and the case was randomly assigned
to Judge Robert Sweet.

00:10:26.599 --> 00:10:29.799
In March 2010, Judge Sweet
issued his opinion --

00:10:30.569 --> 00:10:32.427
152 pages --

00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:35.086
and a complete victory for our side.

00:10:35.964 --> 00:10:37.395
In reading the opinion,

00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:42.134
we could not get over how eloquently
he described the science in the case.

00:10:42.504 --> 00:10:45.275
I mean, our brief --
it was pretty good,

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:46.866
but not this good.

00:10:47.778 --> 00:10:51.155
How did he develop such a deep
understanding of this issue

00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:52.339
in such a short time?

00:10:52.363 --> 00:10:55.971
We just could not comprehend
how this had happened.

00:10:55.995 --> 00:10:57.259
So it turned out,

00:10:57.283 --> 00:11:00.593
Judge Sweet's clerk
working for him at the time,

00:11:00.617 --> 00:11:02.097
was not just a lawyer --

00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:03.835
he was a scientist.

00:11:03.859 --> 00:11:05.457
He was not just a scientist --

00:11:05.481 --> 00:11:08.627
he had a PhD in molecular biology.

00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:10.402
(Laughter)

00:11:10.426 --> 00:11:13.001
What an incredible stroke of luck!

00:11:14.058 --> 00:11:15.358
Myriad then appealed

00:11:15.382 --> 00:11:17.877
to the US Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit.

00:11:18.496 --> 00:11:20.512
And here things got really interesting.

00:11:21.465 --> 00:11:24.525
First, in a pivotal moment of this case,

00:11:25.187 --> 00:11:27.818
the US government switched sides.

00:11:28.739 --> 00:11:32.488
So in the district court the government
submitted a brief on Myriad's side.

00:11:32.512 --> 00:11:37.640
But now in direct opposition
to its own patent office,

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:40.372
the US government files a brief
that states that is has

00:11:40.396 --> 00:11:44.084
reconsidered this issue
in light of the district court's opinion,

00:11:44.108 --> 00:11:47.294
and has concluded that isolated DNA
is not patent eligible.

00:11:47.818 --> 00:11:49.629
This was a really big deal,

00:11:49.653 --> 00:11:51.215
totally unexpected.

00:11:52.773 --> 00:11:54.853
The Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit

00:11:54.877 --> 00:11:56.560
hears all patent cases,

00:11:56.584 --> 00:11:59.742
and it has a reputation for being
very, very pro-patent.

00:12:00.305 --> 00:12:02.731
So even with this remarkable development,

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:04.434
we expected to lose.

00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:05.805
And we did.

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:07.541
Sort of.

00:12:08.357 --> 00:12:10.944
Ends up split decision, 2 to 1.

00:12:11.743 --> 00:12:14.239
But the two judges who ruled against us,

00:12:14.263 --> 00:12:16.504
did so for completely different reasons.

00:12:17.275 --> 00:12:19.101
The first one, Judge Lourie,

00:12:19.125 --> 00:12:22.140
made up his own novel,
biological theory --

00:12:22.164 --> 00:12:23.332
totally wrong.

00:12:23.356 --> 00:12:24.367
(Laughter)

00:12:24.391 --> 00:12:26.609
He decided Myriad had created
a new chemical --

00:12:26.633 --> 00:12:28.498
made absolutely no sense.

00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:31.308
Myriad didn't even argue this,
so it came out of the blue.

00:12:31.632 --> 00:12:33.609
The other, Judge Moore,

00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:37.511
said she basically agreed with us
that isolated DNA is a product of nature.

00:12:37.987 --> 00:12:41.320
But she's like, "I don't want
to shake up the biotech industry."

00:12:42.248 --> 00:12:44.820
The third, Judge Bryson,

00:12:45.233 --> 00:12:46.449
agreed with us.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.281
So now we sought review
by the Supreme Court.

00:12:50.305 --> 00:12:53.008
And when you petition the Supreme Court,

00:12:53.032 --> 00:12:56.154
you have to present a question
that you want the Court to answer.

00:12:56.534 --> 00:13:00.261
Usually these questions take the form
of a super-long paragraph,

00:13:00.285 --> 00:13:03.308
like a whole page long
with lots and lots of clauses,

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:05.789
"wherein this" and "therefore that."

00:13:06.294 --> 00:13:10.201
We submitted perhaps
the shortest question presented ever.

00:13:11.312 --> 00:13:12.525
Four words:

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.271
Are human genes patentable?

00:13:16.922 --> 00:13:19.746
Now when Chris first asked me
what I thought of these words,

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.144
I said, "Well, I don't know.

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:24.335
I think you have to say,
'Is isolated DNA patentable?'"

00:13:24.968 --> 00:13:26.137
"Nope.

00:13:26.487 --> 00:13:31.108
I want the justices to have
the very same reaction that I had

00:13:31.132 --> 00:13:34.219
when you brought this issue
to me seven years ago."

00:13:34.896 --> 00:13:37.053
Well, I certainly couldn't
argue with that.

00:13:37.981 --> 00:13:40.864
The Supreme Court only hears
about one percent

00:13:40.888 --> 00:13:42.554
of the cases that it receives,

00:13:42.578 --> 00:13:44.169
and it agreed to hear ours.

00:13:45.772 --> 00:13:49.899
The day of the oral argument arrives,
and it was really, really exciting --

00:13:49.923 --> 00:13:51.358
long line of people outside,

00:13:51.382 --> 00:13:54.146
people had been standing in line
since 2:30 in the morning

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.904
to try to get into the courthouse.

00:13:55.928 --> 00:13:57.899
Two breast cancer organizations,

00:13:57.923 --> 00:13:59.591
Breast Cancer Action and FORCE,

00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:02.316
had organized a demonstration
on the courthouse steps.

00:14:03.232 --> 00:14:06.102
Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway,

00:14:06.776 --> 00:14:09.790
moments before he was to walk in and argue

00:14:09.814 --> 00:14:12.130
the most important case of his career.

00:14:12.765 --> 00:14:15.144
I was clearly more nervous than he was.

00:14:16.096 --> 00:14:20.856
But any remaining panic subsided
as I walked into the courtroom

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.693
and looked around
at a sea of friendly faces:

00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:25.824
our individual women clients

00:14:25.848 --> 00:14:28.289
who had shared their
deeply personal stories,

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.836
the geneticists who had taken huge chunks
of time out of their busy careers

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.685
to dedicate themselves to this fight

00:14:35.122 --> 00:14:37.701
and representatives from a diverse array

00:14:37.725 --> 00:14:39.612
of medical, patient advocacy,

00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:41.712
environmental and religious organizations,

00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:45.268
who had submitted friend of the court
briefs in the case.

00:14:46.609 --> 00:14:49.634
Also in the room were three leaders
of the Human Genome Project,

00:14:49.658 --> 00:14:52.330
including the co-discoverer
of DNA himself,

00:14:52.354 --> 00:14:53.644
James Watson,

00:14:53.668 --> 00:14:55.814
who had submitted a brief to the court,

00:14:55.838 --> 00:14:59.349
where he referred
to gene patenting as "lunacy."

00:14:59.373 --> 00:15:01.221
(Laughter)

00:15:01.245 --> 00:15:04.882
The diversity of the communities
represented in this room

00:15:04.906 --> 00:15:08.347
and the contributions each had made
to make this day a reality

00:15:08.371 --> 00:15:10.668
spoke volumes to what was at stake.

00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:13.599
The argument itself was riveting.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:15.868
Chris argued brilliantly.

00:15:15.892 --> 00:15:17.137
But for me,

00:15:17.161 --> 00:15:20.925
the most thrilling aspect was watching
the Supreme Court justices grapple

00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:22.518
with isolated DNA,

00:15:22.542 --> 00:15:25.768
through a series of colorful analogies
and feisty exchanges,

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:29.132
very much the same way
as our legal team had done

00:15:29.156 --> 00:15:30.846
for the past seven years.

00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:34.322
Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA

00:15:34.346 --> 00:15:37.122
to extracting a medicinal plant
from the Amazon.

00:15:38.516 --> 00:15:42.526
Justice Roberts distinguished it
from carving a baseball bat from a tree.

00:15:43.995 --> 00:15:46.477
And in one of my absolutely
favorite moments,

00:15:46.501 --> 00:15:51.770
Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA
to be "just nature sitting there."

00:15:51.794 --> 00:15:52.894
(Laughter)

00:15:53.318 --> 00:15:56.193
We felt pretty confident
leaving the courtroom that day,

00:15:56.217 --> 00:15:59.223
but I could never have
anticipated the outcome:

00:16:00.574 --> 00:16:02.081
nine to zero.

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:06.747
"A naturally occurring DNA segment
is a product of nature,

00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:09.818
and not patent-eligible merely because
it has been isolated.

00:16:10.394 --> 00:16:11.741
And furthermore,

00:16:11.765 --> 00:16:14.310
Myriad did not create anything."

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.156
Within 24 hours of the decision,

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.572
five labs had announced

00:16:19.596 --> 00:16:22.610
that they would begin to offer testing
for the BRCA genes.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:26.632
Some of them promised to offer the tests
at a lower price than Myriad's.

00:16:27.142 --> 00:16:30.062
Some promised to provide
a more comprehensive test

00:16:30.086 --> 00:16:31.769
than the one Myriad was offering.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.328
But of course the decision
goes far beyond Myriad.

00:16:35.352 --> 00:16:39.748
It ends a 25-year practice
of allowing patents on human genes

00:16:39.772 --> 00:16:40.979
in the United States.

00:16:41.383 --> 00:16:46.076
It clears a significant barrier
to biomedical discovery and innovation.

00:16:46.484 --> 00:16:51.385
And it helps to ensure that patients
like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen

00:16:51.409 --> 00:16:53.565
have access to the tests that they need.

00:16:54.991 --> 00:16:58.206
A few weeks after the court
issued its decision,

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.490
I received a small package in the mail.

00:17:01.246 --> 00:17:02.853
It was from Bob Cook-Deegan,

00:17:02.877 --> 00:17:05.146
a professor at Duke University

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.394
and one the very first people
Chris and I went to visit

00:17:08.418 --> 00:17:11.117
when we started to consider
whether to bring this case.

00:17:12.033 --> 00:17:14.842
I opened it up to find
a small stuffed animal.

00:17:16.344 --> 00:17:19.303
(Laughter)

00:17:21.568 --> 00:17:23.896
We took a big risk in taking this case.

00:17:24.722 --> 00:17:27.232
Part of what gave us the courage
to take that risk

00:17:27.256 --> 00:17:29.694
was knowing that we were doing
the right thing.

00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:33.809
The process took nearly eight years
from the start to finish,

00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:36.054
with many twists and turns along the way.

00:17:36.578 --> 00:17:38.269
A little luck certainly helped,

00:17:38.888 --> 00:17:41.700
but it was the communities
that we bridged,

00:17:41.724 --> 00:17:43.815
the alliances that we created,

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:45.259
that made pigs fly.

00:17:45.802 --> 00:17:46.958
Thank you.

00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:52.496
(Applause)
