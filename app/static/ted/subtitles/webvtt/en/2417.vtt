00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.656
Code is the next universal language.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.856
In the seventies, it was punk music
that drove the whole generation.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.336
In the eighties, it was probably money.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.696
But for my generation of people,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.536
software is the interface
to our imagination and our world.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.256
And that means that we need

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.536
a radically, radically
more diverse set of people

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.336
to build those products,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.296
to not see computers as mechanical
and lonely and boring and magic,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.296
to see them as things
that they can tinker

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.760
and turn around and twist,
and so forth.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.496
My personal journey into the world
of programming and technology

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.496
started at the tender age of 14.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.616
I had this mad teenage crush
on an older man,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.976
and the older man in question
just happened to be

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.416
the then Vice President
of the United States, Mr. Al Gore.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.496
And I did what every single
teenage girl would want to do.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.736
I wanted to somehow
express all of this love,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.336
so I built him a website, it's over here.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.296
And in 2001, there was no Tumblr,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.576
there was no Facebook,
there was no Pinterest.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.736
So I needed to learn to code

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.136
in order to express
all of this longing and loving.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.496
And that is how programming
started for me.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.056
It started as a means of self-expression.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.696
Just like when I was smaller,
I would use crayons and legos.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.320
And when I was older, I would use
guitar lessons and theater plays.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.896
But then, there were other things
to get excited about,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.336
like poetry and knitting socks

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.656
and conjugating French irregular verbs

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.536
and coming up with make-believe worlds

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.696
and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.616
And I started to be one of those people

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.320
who felt that computers
are boring and technical and lonely.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.936
Here's what I think today.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.016
Little girls don't know that they
are not supposed to like computers.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.296
Little girls are amazing.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.456
They are really, really good
at concentrating on things

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.736
and being exact and they ask
amazing questions like,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.336
"What?" and "Why?"
and "How?" and "What if?"

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.040
And they don't know that they
are not supposed to like computers.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.696
It's the parents who do.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.015
It's us parents who feel

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.136
like computer science
is this esoteric, weird science discipline

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.816
that only belongs to the mystery makers.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.576
That it's almost as far removed
from everyday life

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.136
as, say, nuclear physics.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.616
And they are partly right about that.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.136
There's a lot of syntax
and controls and data structures

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.816
and algorithms and practices,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.416
protocols and paradigms in programming.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.736
And we as a community,
we've made computers smaller and smaller.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.296
We've built layers and layers
of abstraction on top of each other

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.816
between the man and the machine

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.056
to the point that we no longer
have any idea how computers work

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.256
or how to talk to them.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.056
And we do teach our kids
how the human body works,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.176
we teach them how
the combustion engine functions

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.216
and we even tell them
that if you want to really be an astronaut

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.696
you can become one.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.896
But when the kid comes to us and asks,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.656
"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?"

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.096
Or, "How does the computer know
what happens when I press 'play,'

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.976
how does it know which video to show?"

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.576
Or, "Linda, is Internet a place?"

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.320
We adults, we grow oddly silent.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.856
"It's magic," some of us say.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.600
"It's too complicated," the others say.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.016
Well, it's neither.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.616
It's not magic and it's not complicated.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.256
It all just happened
really, really, really fast.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.176
Computer scientists built
these amazing, beautiful machines,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.616
but they made them
very, very foreign to us,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.856
and also the language we speak
to the computers

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.896
so that we don't know
how to speak to the computers anymore

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.416
without our fancy user interfaces.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.016
And that's why no one recognized

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.736
that when I was conjugating
French irregular verbs,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.016
I was actually practicing
my pattern recognition skills.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.336
And when I was excited about knitting,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.896
I actually was following
a sequence of symbolic commands

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.656
that included loops inside of them.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.096
And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.096
to find an exact language
between English and mathematics

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.440
found its home inside of a computer.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.280
I was a programmer, but no one knew it.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.536
The kids of today, they tap, swipe
and pinch their way through the world.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.776
But unless we give them tools
to build with computers,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.736
we are raising only consumers
instead of creators.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.296
This whole quest
led me to this little girl.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.696
Her name is Ruby, she is six years old.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.816
She is completely fearless,
imaginative and a little bit bossy.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.296
And every time
I would run into a problem

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.576
in trying to teach
myself programming like,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.576
"What is object-oriented design
or what is garbage collection?",

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.016
I would try to imagine how a six-year-old
little girl would explain the problem.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.696
And I wrote a book about her
and I illustrated it

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.096
and the things
Ruby taught me go like this.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.576
Ruby taught me that you're
not supposed to be afraid

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.976
of the bugs under your bed.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.056
And even the biggest of the problems

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.576
are a group of tiny problems
stuck together.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.336
And Ruby also introduced
me to her friends,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.256
the colorful side of the Internet culture.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.136
She has friends like the Snow Leopard,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.096
who is beautiful but doesn't want
to play with the other kids.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.736
And she has friends like the green robots
that are really friendly but super messy.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.936
And she has friends like Linux the penguin

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.616
who's really ruthlessly efficient,
but somewhat hard to understand.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.880
And idealistic foxes, and so on.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.536
In Ruby's world, you learn
technology through play.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.776
And, for instance, computers
are really good at repeating stuff,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.696
so the way Ruby would teach
loops goes like this.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.096
This is Ruby's favorite dance move,
it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.616
clap, clap and jump."

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.656
And you learn counter loops
by repeating that four times.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.496
And you learn while loops
by repeating that sequence

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.296
while I'm standing on one leg.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.616
And you learn until loops
by repeating that sequence

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.696
until mom gets really mad.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.736
(Laughter)

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.480
And most of all, you learn
that there are no ready answers.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.056
When coming up with the curriculum
for Ruby's world,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.376
I needed to really ask the kids
how they see the world

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.416
and what kind of questions they have

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.520
and I would organize
play testing sessions.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.920
I would start by showing the kids
these four pictures.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.816
I would show them a picture of a car,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.256
a grocery store, a dog and a toilet.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.520
And I would ask, "Which one of these
do you think is a computer?"

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.216
And the kids would be
very conservative and go,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.016
"None of these is a computer.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.696
I know what a computer is:

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.056
it's that glowing box

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.696
in front of which mom or dad
spends way too much time."

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.216
But then we would talk

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.056
and we would discover
that actually, a car is a computer,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.456
it has a navigation system inside of it.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.256
And a dog -- a dog
might not be a computer,

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.496
but it has a collar

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.136
and the collar might have
a computer inside of it.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.616
And grocery stores, they have
so many different kinds of computers,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.056
like the cashier system
and the burglar alarms.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.416
And kids, you know what?

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.976
In Japan, toilets are computers

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.896
and there's even hackers who hack them.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.696
(Laughter)

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.936
And we go further

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.176
and I give them these little stickers
with an on/off button on them.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.816
And I tell the kids,
"Today you have this magic ability

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.456
to make anything in this room
into a computer."

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.816
And again, the kids go,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.736
"Sounds really hard,
I don't know the right answer for this."

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.336
But I tell them, "Don't worry,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.936
your parents don't know
the right answer, either.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.176
They've just started
to hear about this thing

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.416
called The Internet of Things.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.416
But you kids,
you are going to be the ones

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.816
who are really going to live up in a world
where everything is a computer."

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.056
And then I had this little girl
who came to me

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.376
and took a bicycle lamp

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.616
and she said, "This bicycle lamp,
if it were a computer,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.656
it would change colors."

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.696
And I said, "That's a really good idea,
what else could it do?"

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.456
And she thinks and she thinks,

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.496
and she goes, "If this bicycle lamp
were a computer,

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.256
we could go on a biking trip
with my father

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.896
and we would sleep in a tent

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.760
and this biking lamp
could also be a movie projector."

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.600
And that's the moment I'm looking for,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.976
the moment when the kid realizes

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.376
that the world
is definitely not ready yet,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.376
that a really awesome way
of making the world more ready

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.616
is by building technology

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.400
and that each one of us
can be a part of that change.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.256
Final story, we also built a computer.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.016
And we got to know the bossy CPU
and the helpful RAM and ROM

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.456
that help it remember things.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.416
And after we've assembled
our computer together,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.096
we also design an application for it.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.135
And my favorite story is this little boy,

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.416
he's six years old

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.559
and his favorite thing in the world
is to be an astronaut.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.376
And the boy, he has
these huge headphones on

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.656
and he's completely immersed
in his tiny paper computer

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.696
because you see, he's built his own

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.016
intergalactic planetary
navigation application.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.176
And his father, the lone astronaut
in the Martian orbit,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.056
is on the other side of the room

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.696
and the boy's important mission

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.640
is to bring the father
safely back to earth.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.216
And these kids are going to have
a profoundly different view of the world

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.640
and the way we build it with technology.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.696
Finally, the more approachable,
the more inclusive,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.096
and the more diverse
we make the world of technology,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.096
the more colorful and better
the world will look like.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.696
So, imagine with me, for a moment,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.296
a world where the stories we tell

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.336
about how things get made
don't only include

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.776
the twentysomething-year-old
Silicon Valley boys,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.200
but also Kenyan schoolgirls
and Norwegian librarians.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.216
Imagine a world where
the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.456
who live in a permanent
reality of 1s and 0s,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.096
they grow up to be very optimistic
and brave about technology.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.496
They embrace the powers
and the opportunities

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.120
and the limitations of the world.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.816
A world of technology
that is wonderful, whimsical

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.480
and a tiny bit weird.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.616
When I was a girl,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.656
I wanted to be a storyteller.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.256
I loved make-believe worlds

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.896
and my favorite thing to do

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.976
was to wake up in the mornings
in Moominvalley.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.120
In the afternoons,
I would roam around the Tatooines.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.200
And in the evenings,
I would go to sleep in Narnia.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.600
And programming turned out
to be the perfect profession for me.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.656
I still create worlds.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.640
Instead of stories, I do them with code.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.696
Programming gives me this amazing power

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.096
to build my whole little universe

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.080
with its own rules
and paradigms and practices.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.080
Create something out of nothing
with the pure power of logic.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.136
Thank you.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.600
(Applause)
