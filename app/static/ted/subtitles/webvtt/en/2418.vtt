00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.054
Melati Wijsen: Bali -- island of gods.

00:00:05.301 --> 00:00:07.642
Isabel Wijsen: A green paradise.

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.552
MW: Or ...

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.393
a paradise lost.

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:14.234
Bali:

00:00:14.696 --> 00:00:16.639
island of garbage.

00:00:17.707 --> 00:00:18.859
IW: In Bali,

00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:24.834
we generate 680 cubic meters
of plastic garbage a day.

00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:28.657
That's about a 14-story building.

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:31.426
And when it comes to plastic bags,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.018
less than five percent gets recycled.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.206
MW: We know that changes the image
you may have of our island.

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.150
It changed ours, too,
when we learned about it,

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:45.735
when we learned that almost all
plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:47.009
and then in our rivers

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:48.404
and then in our ocean.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.364
And those that don't even
make it to the ocean,

00:00:51.388 --> 00:00:53.501
they're either burned or littered.

00:00:54.183 --> 00:00:56.441
IW: So we decided
to do something about it.

00:00:56.812 --> 00:00:59.311
And we've been working
for almost three years now

00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:02.687
to try to say no to plastic bags
on our home island.

00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:05.175
And we have had
some significant successes.

00:01:06.835 --> 00:01:08.867
MW: We are sisters,

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:11.458
and we go to the best school on earth:

00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:13.586
Green School, Bali.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.233
Green School is not only different
in the way that it is built out of bamboo,

00:01:18.257 --> 00:01:20.220
but also in the way that it teaches.

00:01:20.864 --> 00:01:23.551
We are taught to become leaders of today,

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:26.951
something a normal textbook cannot match.

00:01:27.813 --> 00:01:29.834
IW: One day we had a lesson in class

00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:32.571
where we learned about significant people,

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:34.083
like Nelson Mandela,

00:01:34.107 --> 00:01:35.258
Lady Diana

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:36.507
and Mahatma Gandhi.

00:01:37.244 --> 00:01:38.401
Walking home that day,

00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:41.733
we agreed that we also
wanted to be significant.

00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:44.651
Why should we wait until we were grown up

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:45.933
to be significant?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.494
We wanted to do something now.

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:50.835
MW: Sitting on the sofa that night,

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.695
we brainstormed and thought
of all the issues facing Bali.

00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:56.396
And one thing that stood out
to us the most

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.784
was the plastic garbage.

00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:00.603
But that is a huge problem.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.671
So we looked into what was
a realistic target for us kids:

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:06.820
plastic bags.

00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:08.237
And the idea was born.

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:10.964
IW: We started researching,

00:02:10.988 --> 00:02:13.928
and let's just say, the more we learned,

00:02:13.952 --> 00:02:17.041
there was nothing good about plastic bags.

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:18.671
And you know what?

00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:20.273
We don't even need them.

00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:24.544
MW: We were really inspired
by the efforts to say no to plastic bags

00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:26.438
in many other places,

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:28.444
from Hawaii to Rwanda

00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:31.013
and to severals cities
like Oakland and Dublin.

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:37.449
IW: And so the idea turned into the launch
of "Bye Bye Plastic Bags."

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.850
MW: In the years
that we have been campaigning,

00:02:40.874 --> 00:02:43.436
we have learned a lot.

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:45.626
Lesson number one:

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.391
you cannot do it all by yourself.

00:02:48.415 --> 00:02:50.607
You need a big team of like-minded kids,

00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:53.802
and so we formed
the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew.

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.574
The volunteer team includes
children from all over the island,

00:02:57.598 --> 00:02:59.997
from both international and local schools.

00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:01.656
And together with them,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.430
we started a multi-layered approach,

00:03:03.454 --> 00:03:06.750
based on an on- and off-line
signature petition,

00:03:06.774 --> 00:03:10.210
educational and inspirational
presentations at schools

00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:14.719
and we raise general awareness
at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups.

00:03:14.743 --> 00:03:15.894
And last but not least,

00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:17.964
we distribute alternative bags,

00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:19.712
bags like net bags,

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:21.058
recycled newspaper bags

00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:23.802
or 100 percent organic material bags,

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:26.339
all made by local
initiatives on the island.

00:03:26.898 --> 00:03:28.292
IW: We run a pilot village,

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:30.428
home of 800 families.

00:03:30.952 --> 00:03:32.775
The village mayor was our first friend

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.265
and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped.

00:03:36.077 --> 00:03:38.745
We focused on making the customers aware,

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.487
because that's where the change
needs to happen.

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:44.463
The village is already
two-thirds along the way

00:03:44.487 --> 00:03:46.492
of becoming plastic bag free.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.205
Our first attempts to get the government
of Bali on board failed.

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:53.846
So we thought,

00:03:54.391 --> 00:03:58.691
"Hmm ... a petition
with one million signatures.

00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:00.708
They can't ignore us, right?"

00:04:00.732 --> 00:04:01.895
MW: Right!

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:04.093
IW: But, who would have guessed

00:04:04.117 --> 00:04:08.279
one million signatures is, like,
a thousand times a thousand?

00:04:08.303 --> 00:04:09.930
(Laughter)

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.835
We got stuck --

00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:14.738
till we learned lesson number two:

00:04:15.507 --> 00:04:17.462
think outside the box.

00:04:17.808 --> 00:04:18.959
Someone mentioned

00:04:18.983 --> 00:04:25.384
that the Bali airport handles
16 million arrivals and departures a year.

00:04:26.294 --> 00:04:29.610
MW: But how do we get into the airport?

00:04:29.993 --> 00:04:31.686
And here comes lesson number three:

00:04:32.236 --> 00:04:33.676
persistence.

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:35.768
Off we headed to the airport.

00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:37.444
We got past the janitor.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.705
And then it was his boss's boss,

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.990
and then the assistant office manager,

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:43.399
and then the office manager,

00:04:43.423 --> 00:04:44.594
and then ...

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:46.765
we got shuffled down
two levels and thought,

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.954
well, here comes the janitor again.

00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:51.585
And after several days knocking on doors

00:04:51.609 --> 00:04:53.925
and just being kids on a mission,

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.837
we finally got to the commercial
manager of Bali airports.

00:04:58.368 --> 00:05:02.281
And we gave him the "Bali of plastic bags"
speech, and being a very nice man,

00:05:02.305 --> 00:05:06.003
he said, [imitating the man's voice]
"I cannot believe what I'm about say,

00:05:06.027 --> 00:05:08.270
but I'm going to give authorization

00:05:08.294 --> 00:05:11.251
to collect signatures
behind customs and immigrations."

00:05:11.275 --> 00:05:12.619
(Laughter)

00:05:12.643 --> 00:05:16.938
(Applause)

00:05:16.962 --> 00:05:18.906
IW: In our first hour and a half there,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.605
we got almost 1,000 signatures.

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:23.255
How cool is that?

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.851
Lesson number four:

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:28.876
you need champions
at all levels of society,

00:05:29.486 --> 00:05:33.295
from students to commercial
managers to famous people.

00:05:34.097 --> 00:05:36.209
And thanks to the attraction
of Green School,

00:05:36.233 --> 00:05:38.899
we had access to a steady
stream of celebrities.

00:05:39.937 --> 00:05:41.136
Ban Ki Moon taught us

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.521
that Secretary-Generals
of the United Nations

00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:46.196
don't sign petitions --

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.221
(Laughter)

00:05:47.245 --> 00:05:49.082
even if kids ask nicely.

00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:50.791
But he promised to spread the word,

00:05:50.815 --> 00:05:53.328
and now we work closely
with the United Nations.

00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:56.644
MW: Jane Goodall taught us
the power of a people's network.

00:05:57.055 --> 00:06:00.095
She started with just one
Roots &amp; Shoots group

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.410
and now she has 4,000 groups
around the world.

00:06:03.434 --> 00:06:04.607
We are one of them.

00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:06.073
She's a real inspiration.

00:06:06.731 --> 00:06:08.483
If you're a fellow Rotarian,

00:06:08.507 --> 00:06:09.797
nice to meet you.

00:06:09.821 --> 00:06:10.972
We're Interactors,

00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:13.327
the youngest department
of Rotary International.

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:17.816
IW: But we have also learned
much about patience,

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.097
MW: how to deal with frustrations,

00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:21.272
IW: leadership,

00:06:21.296 --> 00:06:22.465
MW: teamwork,

00:06:22.489 --> 00:06:23.640
IW: friendship,

00:06:23.664 --> 00:06:26.323
MW: we learned more
about the Balinese and their culture

00:06:26.347 --> 00:06:29.505
IW: and we learned
about the importance of commitment.

00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:31.840
MW: It's not always easy.

00:06:31.864 --> 00:06:35.329
Sometimes it does get
a little bit hard to walk your talk.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.257
IW: But last year, we did exactly that.

00:06:38.663 --> 00:06:40.266
We went to India to give a talk,

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.845
and our parents took us to visit

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:44.457
the former private house
of Mahatma Gandhi.

00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:47.470
We learned about the power
of hunger strikes

00:06:47.494 --> 00:06:48.770
he did to reach his goals.

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:51.327
Yes, by the end of the tour,

00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:53.002
when we met our parents again,

00:06:53.026 --> 00:06:54.692
we both made a decision and said,

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:56.472
"We're going on a hunger strike!"

00:06:56.496 --> 00:06:57.497
(Laughter)

00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:00.420
MW: And you can probably
imagine their faces.

00:07:00.444 --> 00:07:02.722
It took a lot of convincing,

00:07:02.746 --> 00:07:04.478
and not only to our parents

00:07:04.502 --> 00:07:06.794
but to our friends
and to our teachers as well.

00:07:07.561 --> 00:07:10.532
Isabel and I were serious
about doing this.

00:07:10.556 --> 00:07:12.165
So we met with a nutritionist,

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:14.029
and we came up with a compromise

00:07:14.053 --> 00:07:18.318
of not eating from sunrise
to sunset every day

00:07:18.342 --> 00:07:20.947
until the governor of Bali
would agree to meet with us

00:07:20.971 --> 00:07:24.458
to talk about how to stop
plastic bags on Bali.

00:07:25.118 --> 00:07:29.138
IW: Our "mogak makan,"
as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia,

00:07:29.162 --> 00:07:30.313
started.

00:07:30.337 --> 00:07:32.326
We used social media to support our goal

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.117
and already on day two,

00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:36.407
police started to come
to our home and school.

00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:38.921
What were these two girls doing?

00:07:39.466 --> 00:07:41.976
We knew we weren't making
the governor look his best

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.881
by doing this food strike --

00:07:43.905 --> 00:07:45.339
we could have gone to jail.

00:07:45.768 --> 00:07:47.697
But, hey, it worked.

00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:48.947
Twenty-four hours later,

00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:50.383
we were picked up from school

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:52.430
and escorted to the office
of the governor.

00:07:53.283 --> 00:07:54.796
MW: And there he was --

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.029
(Applause)

00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:58.983
waiting for us to meet and speak,

00:07:59.007 --> 00:08:01.557
being all supportive
and thankful for our willingness

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:04.193
to care for the beauty
and the environment of Bali.

00:08:04.812 --> 00:08:05.963
He signed a promise

00:08:05.987 --> 00:08:08.738
to help the people of Bali
say no to plastic bags.

00:08:08.762 --> 00:08:09.916
And we are now friends,

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.336
and on a regular basis,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.657
we remind him and his team
of the promises he has made.

00:08:15.372 --> 00:08:16.523
And indeed,

00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:18.453
recently he stated and committed

00:08:18.477 --> 00:08:23.120
that Bali will be
plastic bag free by 2018.

00:08:23.144 --> 00:08:29.980
(Applause)

00:08:31.498 --> 00:08:36.115
IW: Also, at the International Airport
of Bali, one of our supporters

00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:40.701
is planning to start
a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.

00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:43.173
MW: Stop handing out free plastic bags

00:08:43.197 --> 00:08:44.893
and bring in your own reusable bag

00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:48.361
is our next message to change
that mindset of the public.

00:08:49.405 --> 00:08:51.102
IW: Our short-term campaign,

00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:52.558
"One Island / One Voice,"

00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:54.016
is all about this.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.719
We check and recognize
the shops and restaurants

00:08:56.743 --> 00:08:59.586
that have declared themselves
a plastic bag-free zone,

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.983
and we put this sticker at their entrance

00:09:02.007 --> 00:09:04.325
and publish their names on social media

00:09:04.349 --> 00:09:06.425
and some important magazines on Bali.

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:07.980
And conversely,

00:09:08.004 --> 00:09:10.829
that highlights those
who do not have the sticker.

00:09:10.853 --> 00:09:12.240
(Laughter)

00:09:12.731 --> 00:09:16.050
MW: So, why are we actually
telling you all of this?

00:09:16.673 --> 00:09:18.591
Well, partly, it is because we are proud

00:09:18.615 --> 00:09:20.686
of the results that,
together with our team,

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.066
we have been able to reach.

00:09:22.469 --> 00:09:24.557
But also because along the way,

00:09:24.581 --> 00:09:27.421
we have learned that kids can do things.

00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:29.099
We can make things happen.

00:09:29.891 --> 00:09:32.318
Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old

00:09:32.342 --> 00:09:33.901
when we started this.

00:09:33.925 --> 00:09:35.978
We never had a business plan,

00:09:36.002 --> 00:09:37.226
nor a fixed strategy,

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.169
nor any hidden agendas --

00:09:39.193 --> 00:09:41.633
just the idea in front of us

00:09:41.657 --> 00:09:43.770
and a group of friends working with us.

00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:46.441
All we wanted to do
was stop those plastic bags

00:09:46.465 --> 00:09:49.107
from wrapping and suffocating
our beautiful home.

00:09:49.933 --> 00:09:51.641
Kids have a boundless energy

00:09:51.665 --> 00:09:55.830
and a motivation to be the change
the world needs.

00:09:56.454 --> 00:10:01.179
IW: So to all the kids of this beautiful
but challenging world:

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.844
go for it!

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:04.623
Make that difference.

00:10:05.057 --> 00:10:07.476
We're not telling you
it's going to be easy.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.767
We're telling you
it's going to be worth it.

00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:14.592
Us kids may only be 25 percent
of the world's population,

00:10:14.616 --> 00:10:17.923
but we are 100 percent of the future.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.706
MW: We still have a lot of work to do,

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.395
but know that we still not stop

00:10:23.419 --> 00:10:27.844
until the first question asked
when arriving at the Bali airports will be

00:10:28.682 --> 00:10:30.016
Both: "Welcome to Bali,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.207
do you have nay plastic bags to declare?"

00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:33.644
(Laughter)

00:10:33.668 --> 00:10:36.404
Om shanti shanti shanti om.

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:37.579
Thank you.

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:47.396
(Applause)
