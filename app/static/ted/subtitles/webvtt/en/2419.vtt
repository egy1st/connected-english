WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.600
This is Pleurobot.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.016
Pleurobot is a robot that we designed
to closely mimic a salamander species

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.440
called Pleurodeles waltl.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.496
Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.560
and as you'll see later, it can also swim.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.471
So you might ask,
why did we design this robot?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.722
And in fact, this robot has been designed
as a scientific tool for neuroscience.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.896
Indeed, we designed it
together with neurobiologists

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.816
to understand how animals move,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.600
and especially how the spinal cord
controls locomotion.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.256
But the more I work in biorobotics,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.661
the more I'm really impressed
by animal locomotion.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.216
If you think of a dolphin swimming
or a cat running or jumping around,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.816
or even us as humans,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.656
when you go jogging or play tennis,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.920
we do amazing things.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.016
And in fact, our nervous system solves
a very, very complex control problem.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.136
It has to coordinate
more or less 200 muscles perfectly,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.840
because if the coordination is bad,
we fall over or we do bad locomotion.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.280
And my goal is to understand
how this works.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.000
There are four main components
behind animal locomotion.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.736
The first component is just the body,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.736
and in fact we should never underestimate

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.240
to what extent the biomechanics
already simplify locomotion in animals.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.376
Then you have the spinal cord,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.376
and in the spinal cord you find reflexes,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.856
multiple reflexes that create
a sensorimotor coordination loop

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360
between neural activity in the spinal cord
and mechanical activity.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.976
A third component
are central pattern generators.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.896
These are very interesting circuits
in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.536
that can generate, by themselves,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.296
very coordinated
rhythmic patterns of activity

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.696
while receiving
only very simple input signals.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.936
And these input signals

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.016
coming from descending modulation
from higher parts of the brain,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.736
like the motor cortex,
the cerebellum, the basal ganglia,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.896
will all modulate activity
of the spinal cord

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.376
while we do locomotion.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.616
But what's interesting is to what extent
just a low-level component,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.576
the spinal cord, together with the body,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.056
already solve a big part
of the locomotion problem.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.502
You probably know it by the fact
that you can cut the head off a chicken,

00:01:57.532 --> 00:01:58.913
it can still run for a while,

00:01:58.937 --> 00:02:01.476
showing that just the lower part,
spinal cord and body,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.373
already solve a big part of locomotion.

00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:05.856
Now, understanding how this works
is very complex,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.176
because first of all,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.820
recording activity in the spinal cord
is very difficult.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:12.616
It's much easier to implant electrodes
in the motor cortex

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.696
than in the spinal cord,
because it's protected by the vertebrae.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.536
Especially in humans, very hard to do.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.336
A second difficulty is that locomotion
is really due to a very complex

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.416
and very dynamic interaction
between these four components.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.680
So it's very hard to find out
what's the role of each over time.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.616
This is where biorobots like Pleurobot
and mathematical models

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.840
can really help.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.736
So what's biorobotics?

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.496
Biorobotics is a very active field
of research in robotics

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.976
where people want to
take inspiration from animals

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.456
to make robots to go outdoors,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.136
like service robots
or search and rescue robots

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.360
or field robots.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.576
And the big goal here
is to take inspiration from animals

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.936
to make robots that can handle
complex terrain --

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.576
stairs, mountains, forests,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.616
places where robots
still have difficulties

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.696
and where animals
can do a much better job.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.216
The robot can be a wonderful
scientific tool as well.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.860
There are some very nice projects
where robots are used,

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:08.856
like a scientific tool for neuroscience,
for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.000
And this is exactly
the purpose of Pleurobot.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.536
So what we do in my lab
is to collaborate with neurobiologists

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.776
like Jean-Marie Cabelguen,
a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.840
and we want to make spinal cord models
and validate them on robots.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.096
And here we want to start simple.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.096
So it's good to start with simple animals

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.376
like lampreys, which are
very primitive fish,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.896
and then gradually
go toward more complex locomotion,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.176
like in salamanders,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.696
but also in cats and in humans,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.920
in mammals.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.256
And here, a robot becomes
an interesting tool

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.216
to validate our models.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.256
And in fact, for me, Pleurobot
is a kind of dream becoming true.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.536
Like, more or less 20 years ago
I was already working on a computer

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.216
making simulations of lamprey
and salamander locomotion

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.776
during my PhD.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.176
But I always knew that my simulations
were just approximations.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.176
Like, simulating the physics in water
or with mud or with complex ground,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.856
it's very hard to simulate that
properly on a computer.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.920
Why not have a real robot
and real physics?

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.736
So among all these animals,
one of my favorites is the salamander.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.216
You might ask why,
and it's because as an amphibian,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.096
it's a really key animal
from an evolutionary point of view.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.176
It makes a wonderful link
between swimming,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.096
as you find it in eels or fish,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.240
and quadruped locomotion,
as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.816
And in fact, the modern salamander

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.216
is very close to the first
terrestrial vertebrate,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.776
so it's almost a living fossil,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.736
which gives us access to our ancestor,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.680
the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.616
So the salamander swims

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.136
by doing what's called
an anguilliform swimming gait,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.800
so they propagate a nice traveling wave
of muscle activity from head to tail.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.616
And if you place
the salamander on the ground,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.976
it switches to what's called
a walking trot gait.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.863
In this case, you have nice
periodic activation of the limbs

00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:50.496
which are very nicely coordinated

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.176
with this standing wave
undulation of the body,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.856
and that's exactly the gait
that you are seeing here on Pleurobot.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.856
Now, one thing which is very surprising
and fascinating in fact

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.016
is the fact that all this can be generated
just by the spinal cord and the body.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.040
So if you take
a decerebrated salamander --

00:05:06.064 --> 00:05:08.080
it's not so nice
but you remove the head --

00:05:08.104 --> 00:05:10.776
and if you electrically
stimulate the spinal cord,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.056
at low level of stimulation
this will induce a walking-like gait.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.536
If you stimulate a bit more,
the gait accelerates.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.456
And at some point, there's a threshold,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.016
and automatically,
the animal switches to swimming.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.416
This is amazing.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.936
Just changing the global drive,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.696
as if you are pressing the gas pedal

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.856
of descending modulation
to your spinal cord,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.880
makes a complete switch
between two very different gaits.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.016
And in fact, the same
has been observed in cats.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.056
If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.296
you can switch between
walk, trot and gallop.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.056
Or in birds, you can make a bird
switch between walking,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.536
at a low level of stimulation,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.376
and flapping its wings
at high-level stimulation.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.416
And this really shows that the spinal cord

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.856
is a very sophisticated
locomotion controller.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.336
So we studied salamander locomotion
in more detail,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.456
and we had in fact access
to a very nice X-ray video machine

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.056
from Professor Martin Fischer
in Jena University in Germany.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.656
And thanks to that,
you really have an amazing machine

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.136
to record all the bone motion
in great detail.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.416
That's what we did.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.616
So we basically figured out
which bones are important for us

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.656
and collected their motion in 3D.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.376
And what we did is collect
a whole database of motions,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.056
both on ground and in water,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.564
to really collect a whole database
of motor behaviors

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:20.833
that a real animal can do.

00:06:20.858 --> 00:06:24.008
And then our job as roboticists
was to replicate that in our robot.

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:27.416
So we did a whole optimization process
to find out the right structure,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.096
where to place the motors,
how to connect them together,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.000
to be able to replay
these motions as well as possible.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.040
And this is how Pleurobot came to life.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.616
So let's look at how close
it is to the real animal.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.456
So what you see here
is almost a direct comparison

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.176
between the walking
of the real animal and the Pleurobot.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.936
You can see that we have
almost a one-to-one exact replay

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.216
of the walking gait.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.840
If you go backwards and slowly,
you see it even better.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.896
But even better, we can do swimming.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.936
So for that we have a dry suit
that we put all over the robot --

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.056
(Laughter)

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.256
and then we can go in water
and start replaying the swimming gaits.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.616
And here, we were very happy,
because this is difficult to do.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.856
The physics of interaction are complex.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.296
Our robot is much bigger
than a small animal,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.376
so we had to do what's called
dynamic scaling of the frequencies

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.736
to make sure we had
the same interaction physics.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.176
But you see at the end,
we have a very close match,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.080
and we were very, very happy with this.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.696
So let's go to the spinal cord.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.016
So here what we did
with Jean-Marie Cabelguen

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.280
is model the spinal cord circuits.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.176
And what's interesting
is that the salamander

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.820
has kept a very primitive circuit,

00:07:34.844 --> 00:07:37.496
which is very similar
to the one we find in the lamprey,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.496
this primitive eel-like fish,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.256
and it looks like during evolution,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.216
new neural oscillators
have been added to control the limbs,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.656
to do the leg locomotion.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.856
And we know where
these neural oscillators are

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.136
but what we did was to make
a mathematical model

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.776
to see how they should be coupled

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.736
to allow this transition
between the two very different gaits.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.320
And we tested that on board of a robot.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.880
And this is how it looks.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.936
So what you see here
is a previous version of Pleurobot

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.056
that's completely controlled
by our spinal cord model

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.680
programmed on board of the robot.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.496
And the only thing we do

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.696
is send to the robot
through a remote control

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.216
the two descending signals
it normally should receive

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.840
from the upper part of the brain.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.176
And what's interesting is,
by playing with these signals,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.000
we can completely control
speed, heading and type of gait.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.816
For instance,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.416
when we stimulate at a low level,
we have the walking gait,

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.416
and at some point, if we stimulate a lot,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.600
very rapidly it switches
to the swimming gait.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.696
And finally, we can also
do turning very nicely

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.240
by just stimulating more one side
of the spinal cord than the other.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.816
And I think it's really beautiful

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.096
how nature has distributed control

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.976
to really give a lot of responsibility
to the spinal cord

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.656
so that the upper part of the brain
doesn't need to worry about every muscle.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.216
It just has to worry
about this high-level modulation,

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.816
and it's really the job of the spinal cord
to coordinate all the muscles.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.360
So now let's go to cat locomotion
and the importance of biomechanics.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.336
So this is another project

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.776
where we studied cat biomechanics,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.696
and we wanted to see how much
the morphology helps locomotion.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.336
And we found three important
criteria in the properties,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.680
basically, of the limbs.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.296
The first one is that a cat limb

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.016
more or less looks
like a pantograph-like structure.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.256
So a pantograph is a mechanical structure

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.680
which keeps the upper segment
and the lower segments always parallel.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.696
So a simple geometrical system
that kind of coordinates a bit

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.536
the internal movement of the segments.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.616
A second property of cat limbs
is that they are very lightweight.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.496
Most of the muscles are in the trunk,

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.416
which is a good idea,
because then the limbs have low inertia

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.216
and can be moved very rapidly.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.056
The last final important property is this
very elastic behavior of the cat limb,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.736
so to handle impacts and forces.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.096
And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.320
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.816
So this is Peter Eckert,
who does his PhD on this robot,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.896
and as you see, it's a cute little robot.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.176
It looks a bit like a toy,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.256
but it was really used
as a scientific tool

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.576
to investigate these properties
of the legs of the cat.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.216
So you see, it's very compliant,
very lightweight,

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.496
and also very elastic,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.296
so you can easily press it down
and it will not break.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.776
It will just jump, in fact.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.680
And this very elastic property
is also very important.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.056
And you also see a bit these properties

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.480
of these three segments
of the leg as pantograph.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.056
Now, what's interesting
is that this quite dynamic gait

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.976
is obtained purely in open loop,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.136
meaning no sensors,
no complex feedback loops.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.576
And that's interesting, because it means

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.616
that just the mechanics
already stabilized this quite rapid gait,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.816
and that really good mechanics
already basically simplify locomotion.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.136
To the extent that we can even
disturb a bit locomotion,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.816
as you will see in the next video,

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.736
where we can for instance do some exercise
where we have the robot go down a step,

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.376
and the robot will not fall over,

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.976
which was a surprise for us.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.416
This is a small perturbation.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.856
I was expecting the robot
to immediately fall over,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.316
because there are no sensors,
no fast feedback loop.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.536
But no, just the mechanics
stabilized the gait,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.136
and the robot doesn't fall over.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.296
Obviously, if you make the step bigger,
and if you have obstacles,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.976
you need the full control loops
and reflexes and everything.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.936
But what's important here
is that just for small perturbation,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.456
the mechanics are right.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.576
And I think this is
a very important message

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.791
from biomechanics and robotics
to neuroscience,

00:11:28.815 --> 00:11:33.495
saying don't underestimate to what extent
the body already helps locomotion.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.600
Now, how does this relate
to human locomotion?

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.600
Clearly, human locomotion is more complex
than cat and salamander locomotion,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.496
but at the same time, the nervous system
of humans is very similar

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.096
to that of other vertebrates.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.576
And especially the spinal cord

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.240
is also the key controller
for locomotion in humans.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.176
That's why, if there's a lesion
of the spinal cord,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.696
this has dramatic effects.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.496
The person can become
paraplegic or tetraplegic.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.896
This is because the brain
loses this communication

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.176
with the spinal cord.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.416
Especially, it loses
this descending modulation

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.360
to initiate and modulate locomotion.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.336
So a big goal of neuroprosthetics

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.736
is to be able to reactivate
that communication

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.200
using electrical or chemical stimulations.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.776
And there are several teams
in the world that do exactly that,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.016
especially at EPFL.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.536
My colleagues Grégoire Courtine
and Silvestro Micera,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.800
with whom I collaborate.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.056
But to do this properly,
it's very important to understand

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.816
how the spinal cord works,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.536
how it interacts with the body,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.040
and how the brain
communicates with the spinal cord.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.696
This is where the robots
and models that I've presented today

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.616
will hopefully play a key role

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.296
towards these very important goals.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.536
Thank you.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.120
(Applause)

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.736
Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen
in your lab other robots

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.216
that do things like swim in pollution

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.696
and measure the pollution while they swim.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.936
But for this one,

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.440
you mentioned in your talk,
like a side project,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.856
search and rescue,

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.056
and it does have a camera on its nose.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.576
Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot --

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.029
We have some spin-off projects

00:13:13.053 --> 00:13:16.496
where we would like to use the robots
to do search and rescue inspection,

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.096
so this robot is now seeing you.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.296
And the big dream is to,
if you have a difficult situation

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.936
like a collapsed building
or a building that is flooded,

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.296
and this is very dangerous
for a rescue team or even rescue dogs,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.216
why not send in a robot
that can crawl around, swim, walk,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.416
with a camera onboard
to do inspection and identify survivors

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.216
and possibly create
a communication link with the survivor.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.816
BG: Of course, assuming the survivors
don't get scared by the shape of this.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.136
AI: Yeah, we should probably
change the appearance quite a bit,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.976
because here I guess a survivor
might die of a heart attack

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.536
just of being worried
that this would feed on you.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.416
But by changing the appearance
and it making it more robust,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.496
I'm sure we can make
a good tool out of it.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.806
BG: Thank you very much.
Thank you and your team.
