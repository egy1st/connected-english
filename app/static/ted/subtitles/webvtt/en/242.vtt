00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.916
There is nothing bigger
or older than the universe.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.428
The questions
I would like to talk about are:

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.738
one, where did we come from?

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.253
How did the universe come into being?

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:23.976
Are we alone in the universe?

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:27.144
Is there alien life out there?

00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:30.613
What is the future of the human race?

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:33.976
Up until the 1920s,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.976
everyone thought the universe
was essentially static

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.976
and unchanging in time.

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:43.655
Then it was discovered
that the universe was expanding.

00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:47.829
Distant galaxies were moving away from us.

00:00:49.504 --> 00:00:53.253
This meant they must have been
closer together in the past.

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:56.356
If we extrapolate back,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.976
we find we must have
all been on top of each other

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.522
about 15 billion years ago.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:07.387
This was the Big Bang,
the beginning of the universe.

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:11.412
But was there anything
before the Big Bang?

00:01:12.483 --> 00:01:15.300
If not, what created the universe?

00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:20.714
Why did the universe emerge
from the Big Bang the way it did?

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.976
We used to think
that the theory of the universe

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.460
could be divided into two parts.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.976
First, there were the laws

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.664
like Maxwell's equations
and general relativity

00:01:33.688 --> 00:01:36.653
that determined the evolution
of the universe,

00:01:36.677 --> 00:01:39.975
given its state
over all of space at one time.

00:01:41.308 --> 00:01:45.976
And second, there was no question
of the initial state of the universe.

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:50.976
We have made good progress
on the first part,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.976
and now have the knowledge
of the laws of evolution

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.976
in all but the most extreme conditions.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.976
But until recently,
we have had little idea

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.126
about the initial conditions
for the universe.

00:02:04.237 --> 00:02:09.666
However, this division into laws
of evolution and initial conditions

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.611
depends on time and space
being separate and distinct.

00:02:14.674 --> 00:02:19.475
Under extreme conditions,
general relativity and quantum theory

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.000
allow time to behave
like another dimension of space.

00:02:27.612 --> 00:02:31.199
This removes the distinction
between time and space,

00:02:31.223 --> 00:02:36.346
and means the laws of evolution
can also determine the initial state.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.346
The universe can spontaneously
create itself out of nothing.

00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:50.976
Moreover, we can calculate
a probability that the universe

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.400
was created in different states.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:56.762
These predictions
are in excellent agreement

00:02:56.786 --> 00:03:02.958
with observations by the WMAP satellite
of the cosmic microwave background,

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.976
which is an imprint
of the very early universe.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.000
We think we have solved
the mystery of creation.

00:03:12.236 --> 00:03:14.768
Maybe we should patent the universe

00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:18.244
and charge everyone royalties
for their existence.

00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:24.354
I now turn to the second big question:

00:03:24.378 --> 00:03:28.000
are we alone, or is there
other life in the universe?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.665
We believe that life arose
spontaneously on the Earth,

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:40.539
so it must be possible for life
to appear on other suitable planets,

00:03:40.563 --> 00:03:44.157
of which there seem to be
a large number in the galaxy.

00:03:46.728 --> 00:03:49.525
But we don't know how life first appeared.

00:03:52.104 --> 00:03:54.976
We have two pieces
of observational evidence

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
on the probability of life appearing.

00:03:59.902 --> 00:04:06.000
The first is that we have fossils of algae
from 3.5 billion years ago.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.156
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.668
and was probably too hot
for about the first half billion years.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.255
So life appeared on Earth

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.931
within half a billion years
of it being possible,

00:04:26.955 --> 00:04:30.631
which is short compared
to the 10-billion-year lifetime

00:04:30.655 --> 00:04:32.273
of a planet of Earth type.

00:04:33.424 --> 00:04:38.115
This suggests that the probability
of life appearing is reasonably high.

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:42.494
If it was very low,
one would have expected it

00:04:42.518 --> 00:04:45.976
to take most
of the ten billion years available.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.730
On the other hand, we don't seem
to have been visited by aliens.

00:04:52.698 --> 00:04:55.571
I am discounting the reports of UFOs.

00:04:56.658 --> 00:04:59.874
Why would they appear
only to cranks and weirdos?

00:05:02.477 --> 00:05:06.542
If there is a government conspiracy
to suppress the reports

00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:10.976
and keep for itself the scientific
knowledge the aliens bring,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.396
it seems to have been a singularly
ineffective policy so far.

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:24.976
Furthermore, despite an extensive search
by the SETI project,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.976
we haven't heard any alien
television quiz shows.

00:05:30.134 --> 00:05:34.421
This probably indicates
that there are no alien civilizations

00:05:34.445 --> 00:05:36.691
at our stage of development

00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:40.000
within a radius
of a few hundred light years.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.976
Issuing an insurance policy

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.673
against abduction by aliens
seems a pretty safe bet.

00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:53.395
This brings me to the last
of the big questions:

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.545
the future of the human race.

00:05:56.661 --> 00:06:00.320
If we are the only intelligent
beings in the galaxy,

00:06:00.344 --> 00:06:03.629
we should make sure
we survive and continue.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.220
But we are entering an increasingly
dangerous period of our history.

00:06:15.964 --> 00:06:20.798
Our population and our use
of the finite resources of planet Earth

00:06:20.822 --> 00:06:22.894
are growing exponentially,

00:06:22.918 --> 00:06:27.917
along with our technical ability
to change the environment for good or ill.

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:34.455
But our genetic code

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.486
still carries the selfish
and aggressive instincts

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.590
that were of survival
advantage in the past.

00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.952
It will be difficult enough
to avoid disaster

00:06:47.976 --> 00:06:49.692
in the next hundred years,

00:06:49.716 --> 00:06:52.239
let alone the next thousand or million.

00:06:56.507 --> 00:06:59.618
Our only chance of long-term survival

00:06:59.642 --> 00:07:02.976
is not to remain inward-looking
on planet Earth,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.228
but to spread out into space.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.420
The answers to these big questions

00:07:10.444 --> 00:07:15.216
show that we have made remarkable progress
in the last hundred years.

00:07:16.296 --> 00:07:20.319
But if we want to continue
beyond the next hundred years,

00:07:20.343 --> 00:07:22.506
our future is in space.

00:07:24.563 --> 00:07:26.976
That is why I am in favor of manned --

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.713
or should I say, 
personned -- space flight.

00:07:35.906 --> 00:07:39.976
All of my life I have sought
to understand the universe

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.489
and find answers to these questions.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.338
I have been very lucky

00:07:45.362 --> 00:07:49.419
that my disability has not been
a serious handicap.

00:07:49.443 --> 00:07:54.082
Indeed, it has probably given me
more time than most people

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:56.376
to pursue the quest for knowledge.

00:08:00.006 --> 00:08:03.976
The ultimate goal is a complete
theory of the universe,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.254
and we are making good progress.

00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:11.920
Thank you for listening.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.814
Chris Anderson: Professor,
if you had to guess either way,

00:08:17.838 --> 00:08:21.644
do you now believe
that it is more likely than not

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:24.986
that we are alone in the Milky Way,

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:30.713
as a civilization of our level
of intelligence or higher?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.976
This answer took seven minutes,
and really gave me an insight

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.052
into the incredible act of generosity
this whole talk was for TED.

00:09:06.483 --> 00:09:10.976
Stephen Hawking: I think it quite likely
that we are the only civilization

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.335
within several hundred light years;

00:09:14.359 --> 00:09:17.772
otherwise we would have heard radio waves.

00:09:20.472 --> 00:09:24.952
The alternative is that civilizations
don't last very long,

00:09:24.976 --> 00:09:27.137
but destroy themselves.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.976
CA: Professor Hawking,
thank you for that answer.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.949
We will take it
as a salutary warning, I think,

00:09:34.973 --> 00:09:37.263
for the rest of our conference this week.

00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:42.267
Professor, we really thank you
for the extraordinary effort you made

00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:45.204
to share your questions with us today.

00:09:45.228 --> 00:09:46.880
Thank you very much indeed.

00:09:46.904 --> 00:09:48.716
(Applause)
