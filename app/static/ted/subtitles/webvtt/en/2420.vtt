00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.616
When I was first learning to meditate,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.696
the instruction was to simply
pay attention to my breath,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.800
and when my mind wandered,
to bring it back.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.000
Sounded simple enough.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.896
Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.256
sweating through T-shirts
in the middle of winter.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.616
I'd take naps every chance I got
because it was really hard work.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.640
Actually, it was exhausting.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.136
The instruction was simple enough

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.280
but I was missing something
really important.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.560
So why is it so hard to pay attention?

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.536
Well, studies show

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.736
that even when we're really
trying to pay attention to something --

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.336
like maybe this talk --

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.576
at some point,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.936
about half of us
will drift off into a daydream,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.040
or have this urge
to check our Twitter feed.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.880
So what's going on here?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.456
It turns out that we're fighting one
of the most evolutionarily-conserved

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.336
learning processes
currently known in science,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.576
one that's conserved

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.040
back to the most basic
nervous systems known to man.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.496
This reward-based learning process

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.696
is called positive
and negative reinforcement,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.280
and basically goes like this.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.896
We see some food that looks good,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.616
our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.136
We eat the food, we taste it --

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.376
it tastes good.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.936
And especially with sugar,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.216
our bodies send a signal
to our brain that says,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.720
"Remember what you're eating
and where you found it."

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.016
We lay down this context-dependent memory

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.496
and learn to repeat the process next time.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.736
See food,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.456
eat food, feel good,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.936
repeat.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.576
Trigger, behavior, reward.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.800
Simple, right?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.056
Well, after a while,
our creative brains say,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.296
"You know what?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.936
You can use this for more
than just remembering where food is.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.136
You know, next time you feel bad,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.600
why don't you try eating
something good so you'll feel better?"

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.736
We thank our brains for the great idea,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.336
try this and quickly learn

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.656
that if we eat chocolate or ice cream
when we're mad or sad,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.880
we feel better.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.016
Same process,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.776
just a different trigger.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.896
Instead of this hunger signal
coming from our stomach,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.896
this emotional signal -- feeling sad --

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.200
triggers that urge to eat.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.560
Maybe in our teenage years,

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.600
we were a nerd at school,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.296
and we see those rebel kids
outside smoking and we think,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.576
"Hey, I want to be cool."

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.800
So we start smoking.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.536
The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,
and that was no accident.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.776
See cool,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.096
smoke to be cool,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.936
feel good. Repeat.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.960
Trigger, behavior, reward.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.896
And each time we do this,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.936
we learn to repeat the process

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.200
and it becomes a habit.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.216
So later,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.856
feeling stressed out triggers
that urge to smoke a cigarette

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.280
or to eat something sweet.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.136
Now, with these same brain processes,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.056
we've gone from learning to survive

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.936
to literally killing ourselves
with these habits.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.216
Obesity and smoking

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.520
are among the leading preventable causes
of morbidity and mortality in the world.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.880
So back to my breath.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.096
What if instead of fighting our brains,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.656
or trying to force ourselves
to pay attention,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.696
we instead tapped into this natural,
reward-based learning process ...

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.920
but added a twist?

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.576
What if instead we just got really curious

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.096
about what was happening
in our momentary experience?

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.656
I'll give you an example.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.896
In my lab,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.256
we studied whether mindfulness training
could help people quit smoking.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.936
Now, just like trying to force myself
to pay attention to my breath,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.216
they could try to force
themselves to quit smoking.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.176
And the majority of them
had tried this before and failed --

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.120
on average, six times.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.456
Now, with mindfulness training,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.800
we dropped the bit about forcing
and instead focused on being curious.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.816
In fact, we even told them to smoke.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.816
What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.376
just be really curious
about what it's like when you do."

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.096
And what did they notice?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.816
Well here's an example
from one of our smokers.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.576
She said, "Mindful smoking:

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.216
smells like stinky cheese

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.856
and tastes like chemicals,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.080
YUCK!"

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.056
Now, she knew, cognitively
that smoking was bad for her,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.960
that's why she joined our program.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.216
What she discovered just by being
curiously aware when she smoked

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.376
was that smoking tastes like shit.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.080
(Laughter)

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.375
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.495
She moved from knowing in her head
that smoking was bad for her

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.976
to knowing it in her bones,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.296
and the spell of smoking was broken.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.680
She started to become
disenchanted with her behavior.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.056
Now, the prefrontal cortex,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.616
that youngest part of our brain
from an evolutionary perspective,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.696
it understands on an intellectual level
that we shouldn't smoke.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.536
And it tries its hardest
to help us change our behavior,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.896
to help us stop smoking,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.040
to help us stop eating that second,
that third, that fourth cookie.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.456
We call this cognitive control.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.280
We're using cognition
to control our behavior.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.176
Unfortunately,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.136
this is also the first part of our brain

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.176
that goes offline
when we get stressed out,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.456
which isn't that helpful.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.957
Now, we can all relate to this
in our own experience.

00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:08.136
We're much more likely to do things
like yell at our spouse or kids

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.776
when we're stressed out or tired,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.136
even though we know
it's not going to be helpful.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.680
We just can't help ourselves.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.296
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.536
we fall back into our old habits,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.416
which is why this disenchantment
is so important.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.096
Seeing what we get from our habits

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.296
helps us understand them
at a deeper level --

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.576
to know it in our bones

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.856
so we don't have to force
ourselves to hold back

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.616
or restrain ourselves from behavior.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.416
We're just less interested
in doing it in the first place.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.976
And this is what mindfulness is all about:

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.680
Seeing really clearly what we get
when we get caught up in our behaviors,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.136
becoming disenchanted on a visceral level

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.280
and from this disenchanted stance,
naturally letting go.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.416
This isn't to say that, poof,
magically we quit smoking.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.056
But over time, as we learn
to see more and more clearly

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.416
the results of our actions,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.080
we let go of old habits and form new ones.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.456
The paradox here

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.296
is that mindfulness is just
about being really interested

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.736
in getting close and personal

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.336
with what's actually happening
in our bodies and minds

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.976
from moment to moment.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.296
This willingness
to turn toward our experience

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.000
rather than trying to make unpleasant
cravings go away as quickly as possible.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.336
And this willingness
to turn toward our experience

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.216
is supported by curiosity,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.976
which is naturally rewarding.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.736
What does curiosity feel like?

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.960
It feels good.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.346
And what happens when we get curious?

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.816
We start to notice that cravings
are simply made up of body sensations --

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.096
oh, there's tightness, there's tension,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.776
there's restlessness --

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.240
and that these body
sensations come and go.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.856
These are bite-size pieces of experiences

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.896
that we can manage from moment to moment

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.056
rather than getting clobbered
by this huge, scary craving

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.456
that we choke on.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.976
In other words, when we get curious,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.736
we step out of our old,
fear-based, reactive habit patterns,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.976
and we step into being.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.896
We become this inner scientist

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.136
where we're eagerly awaiting
that next data point.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.696
Now, this might sound
too simplistic to affect behavior.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.176
But in one study,
we found that mindfulness training

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.096
was twice as good as gold standard therapy
at helping people quit smoking.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.560
So it actually works.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.616
And when we studied
the brains of experienced meditators,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.456
we found that parts of a neural network
of self-referential processing

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.056
called the default mode network

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.296
were at play.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.256
Now, one current hypothesis
is that a region of this network,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.496
called the posterior cingulate cortex,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.256
is activated not necessarily
by craving itself

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.896
but when we get caught up in it,
when we get sucked in,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.616
and it takes us for a ride.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.736
In contrast, when we let go --

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.136
step out of the process

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.656
just by being curiously aware
of what's happening --

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.800
this same brain region quiets down.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.416
Now we're testing app and online-based
mindfulness training programs

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.576
that target these core mechanisms

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.096
and, ironically, use the same technology
that's driving us to distraction

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.656
to help us step out
of our unhealthy habit patterns

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.696
of smoking, of stress eating
and other addictive behaviors.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.296
Now, remember that bit
about context-dependent memory?

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.216
We can deliver these tools
to peoples' fingertips

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.496
in the contexts that matter most.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.736
So we can help them

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.736
tap into their inherent capacity
to be curiously aware

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.680
right when that urge to smoke
or stress eat or whatever arises.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.456
So if you don't smoke or stress eat,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.135
maybe the next time you feel this urge
to check your email when you're bored,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.399
or you're trying to distract
yourself from work,

00:08:34.423 --> 00:08:38.222
or maybe to compulsively respond
to that text message when you're driving,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.936
see if you can tap into
this natural capacity,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.216
just be curiously aware

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.176
of what's happening in your body
and mind in that moment.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.656
It will just be another chance

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.336
to perpetuate one of our endless
and exhaustive habit loops ...

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.600
or step out of it.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.976
Instead of see text message,
compulsively text back,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.736
feel a little bit better --

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.216
notice the urge,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.696
get curious,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.656
feel the joy of letting go

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.880
and repeat.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.656
Thank you.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.040
(Applause)
