00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:02.253
I'm infatuated

00:00:02.277 --> 00:00:04.078
with this concept of impossible.

00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:10.100
So infatuated, that I have made it
my life's mission

00:00:10.124 --> 00:00:12.180
to make things not impossible.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.051
And the way that I go about doing that

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:19.352
is this mash-up of technology and story.

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:24.212
Technology, for me,
my past life as a producer,

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:28.950
was this space of animation
and design and graphics

00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:31.274
and things that came out of a computer,

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:34.005
but in a 3D way or a 2D way.

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:38.591
But the world that I play in
now is technology,

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.826
but it's technology
for the sake of humanity.

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:42.603
And what that means is:

00:00:42.627 --> 00:00:45.524
how do you take something
and crack it open

00:00:45.548 --> 00:00:47.224
and modify it

00:00:47.248 --> 00:00:49.858
and zip-tie it or duct-tape
it back together

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.428
and maybe reprogram it in a way

00:00:51.452 --> 00:00:54.715
so that it accomplishes
a fundamental social and human need?

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:59.860
And the way that I go about doing that

00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:01.944
is that, once you create that,

00:01:01.968 --> 00:01:04.135
then you make it
accessible to people, right?

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.531
If you make something
and no one has access to it,

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:07.707
then what's the point?

00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:10.828
So then we try to get that
out there as much as we can, right?

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:15.368
The story side, I look through this lens
called "Help one, help many."

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.688
And what this means is,
if I said to you guys today,

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:21.484
"Who here wants to help me cure hunger?"

00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:24.566
Who here has a clue how to do that?

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.228
And you're like, "Oh, yeah, um, yeah."

00:01:27.252 --> 00:01:29.212
Oh, you do. Good. Let's talk after this.

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:30.340
(Laughter)

00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:33.347
But that's big, right?
That's really, really big.

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:36.104
But if I said, "Hey,
when I was coming in today,

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:39.701
it was cold and there was a guy outside
and he looked hungry,

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:41.737
he looked like he needed something to eat.

00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.699
Let's everybody chip in a buck,
everybody put a buck in a hat,

00:01:44.723 --> 00:01:46.519
and let's go buy the guy a sandwich."

00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:47.928
Now we've helped one person,

00:01:47.952 --> 00:01:49.998
but maybe we put in a couple bucks.

00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:52.998
Now we can buy a couple sandwiches,
more sandwiches for people.

00:01:53.022 --> 00:01:54.506
That's how it starts to spread.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.299
You help one person, and then
it starts to spread to many.

00:01:57.323 --> 00:02:00.662
So the lens that I look through
with any project I'm about to take on,

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.763
I look through this lens of,
who is the one?

00:02:02.787 --> 00:02:04.884
Who is the one person
I focus that story on,

00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:06.931
that can then help many, many people?

00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:10.234
So I'm out to dinner,

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:13.739
and a friend says, "Hey, you've got
to check this guy out named Dr. Tom."

00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:15.510
So I went home and I researched him,

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.931
and what I found about this guy
is he's this doctor

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:21.748
in the Nuba Mountains, which is
this area between Sudan and South Sudan.

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:25.348
And he is the only doctor
within a 1,500 mile radius

00:02:25.372 --> 00:02:30.272
and he literally does everything
from deliver babies to appendectomies.

00:02:30.296 --> 00:02:31.641
If it's medical,

00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:33.793
he's the only guy who can do it.

00:02:33.817 --> 00:02:35.515
And so I'm learning about this guy,

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.574
and later on in the article it says,

00:02:37.598 --> 00:02:41.434
you know, the one thing he hates to do
is to perform amputations.

00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:44.239
Which begs the question,

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:45.916
why is he performing amputations?

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:49.632
And what I learned is that the area
of the Nuba Mountains,

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:51.197
especially the area where he is,

00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:54.155
is constantly being bombarded
by President Bashir,

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.870
the current reigning president of Sudan.

00:02:56.894 --> 00:02:59.314
And what he does is he runs
this campaign of terror

00:02:59.338 --> 00:03:02.296
over the public there, and he bombs them

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.669
with rolling these 55-gallon drums
filled with jet fuel and shrapnel

00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:08.931
out of the back of these big
turboprop planes.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.112
It's horrible.

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:12.710
They hit the ground, they make a crater,

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.628
shrapnel goes flying everywhere,

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.960
and so if you're in that path
of the shrapnel,

00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:18.376
not doing so good.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.905
So because of that,
there's foxholes everywhere.

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:22.881
People will jump into caves,

00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:24.573
there's this system.

00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:26.094
And then when the dust settles,

00:03:26.118 --> 00:03:28.522
people come out
and they carry on about their day.

00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:33.249
But there was one particular amputation
that Dr. Tom had to do,

00:03:33.273 --> 00:03:35.476
and he talked about
a young boy named Daniel

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.573
who was out tending
his family's goats and cows,

00:03:38.597 --> 00:03:40.932
he heard the bombers come,

00:03:40.956 --> 00:03:45.175
and he was out in the field,
so there was no foxhole to jump in.

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:48.951
And so he wrapped his arms
around a tree that was closest to him.

00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:50.919
The bomb went off not far from him.

00:03:50.943 --> 00:03:53.748
The tree protected his body
from the blast,

00:03:53.772 --> 00:03:55.567
but it blew off his arms.

00:03:56.566 --> 00:03:59.559
And so I'm reading this story,
and I was like, "Ohhhh."

00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:03.119
And what got me is what he said
when he woke up.

00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:06.793
He realized he was now
an armless Sudanese boy --

00:04:06.817 --> 00:04:09.766
and it's hard enough to stay alive
in Sudan with arms --

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.020
and he said, "If I could die, I would.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.870
Because now I'm going to be such
a burden to my family."

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:21.520
Look, everybody here
has experienced despair before,

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:24.842
but can you imagine actually
wanting to be dead

00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:27.661
because you don't want
to be a pain to your parents?

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.877
So, I'm reading this.

00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:32.457
This is all happening
at my kitchen counter,

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:36.142
and just down the hallway,
these guys are asleep.

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:37.321
My guys.

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:40.501
And I couldn't imagine them waking up
with that feeling of, like,

00:04:40.525 --> 00:04:42.065
"Oh, I wish I was dead."

00:04:42.863 --> 00:04:44.210
So I have a process.

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:46.797
And my process is:

00:04:47.484 --> 00:04:48.642
you commit,

00:04:49.783 --> 00:04:52.664
then you figure out how the heck
you're going to pull it off.

00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:53.695
(Laughter)

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:56.823
And I read this, and I saw this
about this young boy named Daniel,

00:04:56.847 --> 00:04:58.684
and I said, "I've got to do something.

00:04:58.708 --> 00:05:01.081
I don't know what,
but I've got to do something."

00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:03.587
So the way I work

00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:06.035
and the way I kind of look for things is,

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:10.107
I start to go, "Wait a second, I read
something or I did something about that."

00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:13.732
And we had just done an article
about this brilliant carpenter

00:05:13.756 --> 00:05:14.943
in South Africa,

00:05:14.967 --> 00:05:17.830
who accidentally cut his fingers off
in a table saw accident,

00:05:17.854 --> 00:05:19.783
and had to 3D print fingers for himself.

00:05:19.807 --> 00:05:22.347
And I'm like, "Wait --
if that guy's printing fingers,

00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:24.620
maybe we can come over
and use that finger thing

00:05:24.644 --> 00:05:25.897
to make an arm for Daniel.

00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:27.402
Maybe there's something there."

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:30.429
So when you see things
that are tangential or relative

00:05:30.453 --> 00:05:31.623
to what your problem is,

00:05:31.647 --> 00:05:33.666
that's what I call
"morsels of permission."

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.049
You look for little morsels
and bits and bobs here

00:05:36.073 --> 00:05:37.798
and you start to pull those together

00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:40.637
and put them all into a pile
and that's your end solution.

00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:43.501
So I invited all these
brilliant people to my house,

00:05:43.525 --> 00:05:45.010
people way smarter than myself,

00:05:45.034 --> 00:05:46.972
and we started to explore different ways

00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:48.785
that we could make an arm for Daniel.

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:51.303
And we played around
with different types of plastic.

00:05:51.327 --> 00:05:53.296
We played with 3D printing.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.879
We played with even balsa wood.

00:05:54.903 --> 00:05:56.743
And the result of the weekend ...

00:05:57.687 --> 00:05:59.732
was a gigantic failure.

00:06:00.762 --> 00:06:01.926
Nothing worked.

00:06:02.302 --> 00:06:04.183
Here's what kind of a failure it was.

00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:07.262
A friend of ours came over
and she was missing a left arm.

00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:09.560
We printed her a right arm.

00:06:09.584 --> 00:06:11.765
(Laughter)

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.482
That gives you a taste test
of how the weekend went.

00:06:15.506 --> 00:06:18.703
So I was going, right? I'm going.

00:06:19.124 --> 00:06:22.609
And Richard, the carpenter
who had cut his fingers off,

00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:24.711
had actually generously
come out to help us,

00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:27.127
and he said, "Mate,
I don't think you should go.

00:06:29.063 --> 00:06:32.038
First of all, you don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

00:06:32.062 --> 00:06:33.261
Sudan is gnarly,

00:06:33.285 --> 00:06:38.738
and you are going to be a big, tall,
bald, shining target walking around."

00:06:39.393 --> 00:06:41.265
And he goes, "And there's this thing --

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:42.440
you don't have an arm.

00:06:42.464 --> 00:06:43.814
There's that thing, too."

00:06:45.258 --> 00:06:47.295
He said, "You're still going, aren't you."

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:48.961
And I said, "Yeah, I've got to go.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.340
I'm going. Tickets are bought. I'm going."

00:06:51.364 --> 00:06:53.737
And he goes, "All right,
I figured you'd say that,

00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:57.148
So here's the deal: why don't you come
to my place in South Africa,

00:06:57.172 --> 00:06:58.665
I'll teach you how to 3D print,

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:00.337
I'll teach you everything I know,

00:07:00.361 --> 00:07:02.498
and then, if you're ready,
then off you go."

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:03.770
I said, "All right, deal."

00:07:03.794 --> 00:07:04.945
So I hopped in a plane.

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:07.228
I was petrified because
when I got on the plane,

00:07:07.252 --> 00:07:08.681
I didn't know how to 3D print.

00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:10.995
I'm going to Sudan
to make something for this boy

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:13.320
who I've never met,
but I'd never made it before.

00:07:13.344 --> 00:07:15.927
But I'm getting on this plane,
so here we go. Geronimo!

00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:17.581
I hop on, I go to Richard's place,

00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:20.686
he teaches me everything he knows:
he teaches me how to 3D print,

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.355
teaches me how to work with hands,

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:24.165
teaches me how to work with amputees,

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:27.975
and the details of the fingers
and how everything works.

00:07:28.556 --> 00:07:29.708
And he teaches me.

00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:32.212
So we're like, "All right,
here we go, it's working."

00:07:32.236 --> 00:07:33.525
He shows me how to do it.

00:07:33.549 --> 00:07:35.482
So I say goodbye to his family,

00:07:35.506 --> 00:07:37.269
I hop on a plane,

00:07:37.293 --> 00:07:38.956
I land in Sudan.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.290
That's not the plane.

00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:41.894
(Laughter)

00:07:41.918 --> 00:07:44.472
Otherwise, I wouldn't
be in front of you right now.

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:48.890
I land in Sudan, and the organization
that's with us takes us over

00:07:48.914 --> 00:07:51.282
to this little shed that we called home,

00:07:51.306 --> 00:07:52.684
and we just started to work.

00:07:52.708 --> 00:07:54.648
We started to work, and we cleaned it up

00:07:54.672 --> 00:07:56.181
and started getting it set up.

00:07:56.205 --> 00:07:57.391
And we started to print,

00:07:57.415 --> 00:07:59.875
and started to make the mold
of the arm for Daniel,

00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:02.971
and started to figure out
how it would work and how it would fit.

00:08:02.995 --> 00:08:05.713
I was nervous. I'm like,
"I've never done this before.

00:08:05.737 --> 00:08:08.955
You know, there's a thing in carpentry:
you measure twice, cut once.

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:10.994
I'm measuring seven times
and cutting once.

00:08:11.018 --> 00:08:12.642
And we go through this process,

00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:15.453
and literally everything
that could go wrong did.

00:08:15.477 --> 00:08:17.519
You guys know how 3D printing works?

00:08:17.543 --> 00:08:20.816
The filament -- it was so hot
it was melting to itself

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.738
before it got into the 3D printer.

00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:26.298
The bugs were dive-bombing
the printer and jamming it up.

00:08:26.322 --> 00:08:27.724
Everything was going wrong --

00:08:27.748 --> 00:08:30.465
the electricity was surging --
everything was going wrong.

00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:33.055
But every day we'd wake up,
and there's Daniel,

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:38.463
and he's like, "What's up?
How's it going, big, shiny, tall guy?"

00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:39.654
(Laughter)

00:08:40.297 --> 00:08:43.127
And so we just kept pushing through it.

00:08:43.801 --> 00:08:48.941
And then four days to the day
that I read the article about Dr. Tom,

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:51.297
we made an arm for Daniel.

00:08:51.908 --> 00:08:54.493
And Daniel fed himself
for the first time in two years.

00:08:55.158 --> 00:08:57.164
(Applause)

00:08:57.188 --> 00:08:58.401
Thank you.

00:08:58.425 --> 00:09:03.965
(Applause)

00:09:03.989 --> 00:09:05.139
And it was

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:06.926
awesome.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.047
It was awesome to watch him

00:09:09.071 --> 00:09:11.545
be able to now have that independence.

00:09:11.569 --> 00:09:14.358
But we didn't show up
just to help Daniel, right?

00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:16.622
It's, how do you make this bigger?

00:09:16.646 --> 00:09:18.287
How do you help many people?

00:09:18.794 --> 00:09:20.643
So, we didn't have a lot of time left,

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:23.406
but we started to teach
some of the locals in his village

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.725
how to use these printers.

00:09:24.749 --> 00:09:26.289
I started to teach them.

00:09:26.313 --> 00:09:28.639
And they'd never seen a 3D printer before.

00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:32.367
And we taught and we pushed them
through all of this stuff.

00:09:32.391 --> 00:09:34.081
I ended up having to get on a plane

00:09:34.105 --> 00:09:35.454
and fly back to Los Angeles.

00:09:35.478 --> 00:09:38.002
When I got on the plane, I'm like,
"I hope it works.

00:09:38.026 --> 00:09:40.949
But I didn't have enough time with them.
Is it going to work?"

00:09:40.973 --> 00:09:42.655
And I landed back in Los Angeles,

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:45.592
and I got off the plane -- it took me
four days to get back --

00:09:45.616 --> 00:09:47.307
I landed, and I turned on my phone,

00:09:47.331 --> 00:09:49.244
and Dr. Tom had sent me an email

00:09:49.268 --> 00:09:51.698
and said, "Hey, hope the trip
back wasn't too bad,

00:09:51.722 --> 00:09:54.291
but you'll be psyched to know

00:09:54.315 --> 00:09:55.573
while you were in the air,

00:09:55.597 --> 00:09:56.835
two more arms were made."

00:09:57.866 --> 00:10:01.144
And I'm walking through LAX just like,

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:03.105
"Yeah! Yes!"

00:10:03.129 --> 00:10:04.914
And people are kind of looking at me,

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.444
as they're walking their kids
and their strollers by.

00:10:07.468 --> 00:10:08.530
(Laughter)

00:10:08.554 --> 00:10:10.316
And the crazy thing is,

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.174
that we ended up creating the world's
first 3D printing prosthetic laboratory.

00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:15.916
Most arms cost 15 grand.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.811
The Daniel arm cost 100 bucks!

00:10:18.805 --> 00:10:20.415
And it's cheaper now!

00:10:22.332 --> 00:10:25.067
How did we pull it off
and why did we pull it off?

00:10:27.575 --> 00:10:28.895
We found our one.

00:10:29.617 --> 00:10:31.587
Right? We found our one.

00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:34.566
So the question that I ask you guys today

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.153
in that concept of help one, help many:

00:10:39.518 --> 00:10:40.701
Who is your one?

00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:43.137
And who is your Daniel?

00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:46.098
(Applause)

00:10:46.122 --> 00:10:47.596
Thank you, guys.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.690
(Applause)
