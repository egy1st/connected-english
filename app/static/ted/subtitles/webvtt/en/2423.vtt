00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:06.456
Our ability to create
and sustain economic growth

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.216
is the defining challenge of our time.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.776
Of course there are other challenges --

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.936
health care, disease burdens
and pandemics,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.760
environmental challenges

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.080
and, of course, radicalized terrorism.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.016
However,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.616
to the extent that we can actually
solve the economic growth challenge,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.976
it will take us a long way

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.600
to solving the challenges
that I've just elucidated.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.056
More importantly,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.576
unless and until we solve economic growth

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.616
and create sustainable,
long-term economic growth,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.056
we'll be unable to address

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.416
the seemingly intractable challenges
that continue to pervade the globe today,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.840
whether it's health care,
education or economic development.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.880
The fundamental question is this:

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.136
How are we going to create economic growth

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.736
in advanced and developed economies
like the United States and across Europe

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.816
at a time when they continue to struggle

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.640
to create economic growth
after the financial crisis?

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.256
They continue to underperform

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.400
and to see an erosion in the three
key drivers of economic growth:

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.360
capital, labor and productivity.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.576
In particular,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.536
these developed economies
continue to see debts and deficits,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.416
the decline and erosion
of both the quality and quantity of labor

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.720
and they also see productivity stalling.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.296
In a similar vein,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.736
how are we going to create
economic growth in the emerging markets,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.016
where 90 percent
of the world's population lives

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.576
and where, on average,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.120
70 percent of the population
is under the age of 25?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.096
In these countries,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.296
it is essential that they grow
at a minimum of seven percent a year

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.416
in order to put a dent in poverty

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.640
and to double per capita incomes
in one generation.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.576
And yet today,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.696
the largest emerging economies --

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.416
countries with at least
50 million people --

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.920
continue to struggle to reach
that seven percent magic mark.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.976
Worse than that,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.616
countries like India, Russia,
South Africa, Brazil and even China

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.136
are falling below
that seven percent number

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.000
and, in many cases, actually regressing.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.720
Economic growth matters.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.896
With economic growth,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.096
countries and societies
enter into a virtuous cycle

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.720
of upward mobility, opportunity
and improved living standards.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.056
Without growth,
countries contract and atrophy,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.296
not just in the annals
of economic statistics

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.840
but also in the meaning of life
and how lives are lived.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.320
Economic growth matters
powerfully for the individual.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.736
If growth wanes,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.776
the risk to human progress

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.216
and the risk of political
and social instability rises,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.800
and societies become dimmer,
coarser and smaller.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.296
The context matters.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.936
And countries in emerging markets

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.800
do not need to grow at the same
rates as developed countries.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.680
Now, I know some of you in this room
find this to be a risky proposition.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.536
There are some people here

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.096
who will turn around
and be quite disillusioned

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.896
by what's happened around the world

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.520
and basically ascribe that
to economic growth.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.736
You worry about the
overpopulation of the planet.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.656
And looking at the UN's
recent statistics and projections

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.376
that the world will have
11 billion people on the planet

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.976
before it plateaus in 2100,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.816
you're concerned about what that does
to natural resources --

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.960
arable land, potable water,
energy and minerals.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.120
You are also concerned about
the degradation of the environment.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.896
And you worry about how man,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.536
embodied in the corporate globalist,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.600
has become greedy and corrupt.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.936
But I'm here to tell you today
that economic growth

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.336
has been the backbone
of changes in living standards

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.320
of millions of people around the world.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.776
And more importantly,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.280
it's not just economic growth
that has been driven by capitalism.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.736
The definition of capitalism,
very simply put,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.816
is that the factors of production,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.216
such as trade and industry,
capital and labor,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.160
are left in the hands
of the private sector and not the state.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.416
It's really essential here
that we understand

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.456
that fundamentally the critique
is not for economic growth per se

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.536
but what has happened to capitalism.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.576
And to the extent that we need to create
economic growth over the long term,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.280
we're going to have to pursue it
with a better form of economic stance.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.216
Economic growth needs capitalism,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.920
but it needs it to work properly.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.136
And as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.120
the core of the capitalist system
has been defined by private actors.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.776
And even this, however,
is a very simplistic dichotomy.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.720
Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.776
When in practical experience,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.256
capitalism is much more of a spectrum.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.536
And we have countries such as China,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.976
which have practiced
more state capitalism,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.096
and we have countries
like the Unites States

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.720
which are more market capitalist.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.296
Our efforts to critique
the capitalist system, however,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.536
have tended to focus
on countries like China

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.960
that are in fact
not blatantly market capitalism.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.256
However, there is
a real reason and real concern

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.936
for us to now focus our attentions
on purer forms of capitalism,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.680
particularly those embodied
by the United States.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.056
This is really important

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.536
because this type of capitalism

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.816
has increasingly
been afforded the critique

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.256
that it is now fostering corruption

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.656
and, worse still,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.320
it's increasing income inequality --

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.840
the idea that the few are benefiting
at the expense of the many.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.976
The two really critical questions
that we need to address

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.696
is how can we fix capitalism

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.496
so that it can help create economic growth

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.880
but at the same time
can help to address social ills.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.096
In order to think about that framing,
we have to ask ourselves,

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.840
how does capitalism work today?

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.360
Very simplistically,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.736
capitalism is set on the basis
of an individual utility maximizer --

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.056
a selfish individual
who goes after what he or she wants.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.216
And only after they've
maximized their utility

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.736
do they then decide it's important

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.840
to provide support
to other social contracts.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.776
Of course, in this system
governments do tax,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.536
and they use part of their revenues
to fund social programs,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.416
recognizing that government's role
is not just regulation

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.720
but also to be arbiter of social goods.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.616
But nevertheless,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.976
this framework --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.976
this two-stage framework --

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.976
is the basis from which we must now start

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.600
to think about how we can
improve the capitalist model.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.920
I would argue that there are
two sides to this challenge.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.736
First of all,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.696
we can draw on the right-wing policies

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.576
to see what could be beneficial for us

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.720
to think about how
we can improve capitalism.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.696
In particular,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.456
right-leaning policies

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.936
have tended to focus on things
like conditional transfers,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.976
where we pay and reward people
for doing the things

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.456
that we actually think
can help enhance economic growth.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.696
For example,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.336
sending children to school,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.576
parents could earn money for that,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.976
or getting their children
inoculated or immunized,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.880
parents could get paid for doing that.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.456
Now, quite apart from the debate

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.776
on whether or not
we should be paying people

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.496
to do what we think they should do anyway,

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.696
the fact of the matter
is that pay for performance

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.136
has actually yielded some positive results

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.856
in places like Mexico,

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.136
in Brazil

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.760
and also in pilot programs in New York.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.016
But there are also benefits

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.400
and significant changes underway
on left-leaning policies.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.136
Arguments that government should
expand its role and responsibility

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.376
so that it's not so narrowly defined

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.895
and that government should be
much more of an arbiter

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.296
of the factors of production

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.720
have become commonplace
with the success of China.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.696
But also we've started to have debates

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.976
about how the role of the private sector

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.576
should move away
from just being a profit motive

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.096
and really be more engaged
in the delivery of social programs.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.336
Things like the corporate
social responsibility programs,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.336
albeit small in scale,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.240
are moving in that right direction.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.176
Of course, left-leaning policies
have also tended to blur the lines

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.880
between government,
NGOs and private sector.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.776
Two very good examples of this
are the 19th-century United States,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.416
when the infrastructure rollout

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.536
was really about
public-private partnerships.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.976
More recently, of course,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.616
the advent of the Internet
has also proven to the world

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.480
that public and private can work together
for the betterment of society.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.296
My fundamental message to you is this:

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.736
We cannot continue to try and solve
the world economic growth challenges

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.920
by being dogmatic
and being unnecessarily ideological.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.616
In order to create sustainable,
long-term economic growth

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.936
and solve the challenges and social ills
that continue to plague the world today,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.256
we're going to have to be
more broad-minded

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.800
about what might work.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.856
Ultimately,

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.016
we have to recognize
that ideology is the enemy of growth.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.256
Thank you.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.520
(Applause)

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.056
Bruno Giussani: I want to ask
a couple of questions, Dambisa,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.216
because one could react
to your last sentence

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.056
by saying growth is also an ideology,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.416
it's possibly the dominant
ideology of our times.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.536
What do you say
to those who react that way?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.016
DM: Well, I think that that's
completely legitimate,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.616
and I think that we're already
having that discussion.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.856
There's a lot of work
going on around happiness

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.376
and other metrics being used
for measuring people's success

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.216
and improvements in living standards.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.296
And so I think that we should be open

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.296
to what could deliver improvements
in people's living standards

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.576
and continue to reduce
poverty around the world.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.416
BG: So you're basically pleading
for rehabilitating growth,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.016
but the only way for that happen

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.376
without compromising
the capacity of the earth,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.936
to take us on a long journey,

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.616
is for economic growth

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.336
somehow to decouple
from the underlying use of resources.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.656
Do you see that happening?

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.216
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic
about human ability and ingenuity.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.416
I think if we start to constrain ourselves

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.496
using the finite, scarce
and depleting resources

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.776
that we know today,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.136
we could get quite negative

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.376
and quite concerned
about the way the world is.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.696
However, we've seen the Club of Rome,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.136
we've seen previous claims

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.496
that the world would be
running out of resources,

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.096
and it's not to argue
that those things are not valid.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.776
But I think, with ingenuity
we could see desalination,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.736
I think we could reinvest in energy,

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.896
so that we can actually
get better outcomes.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.136
And so in that sense,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.536
I'm much more optimistic
about what humans can do.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.976
BG: The thing that strikes me

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.376
about your proposals
for rehabilitating growth

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.016
and taking a different direction

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.096
is that you're kind of suggesting
to fix capitalism with more capitalism --

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.736
with putting a price tag
on good behavior as incentive

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.936
or developing a bigger role
for business in social issues.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.456
Is that what you're suggesting?

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.616
DM: I'm suggesting
we have to be open-minded.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.856
I think it is absolutely the case

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.336
that traditional models of economic growth

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.776
are not working the way
we would like them to.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.696
And I think it's no accident

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.016
that today the largest
economy in the world, the United States,

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.336
has democracy,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.456
liberal democracy,
as it's core political stance

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.656
and it has free market capitalism --

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.256
to the extent that it is free --

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.456
free market capitalism
as its economic stance.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.616
The second largest economy is China.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.776
It has deprioritized democracy

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.976
and it has state capitalism,
which is a completely different model.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.736
These two countries,
completely different political models

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.736
and completely different economic models,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.176
and yet they have the same
income inequality number

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.696
measured as a Gini coefficient.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.856
I think those are the debates
we should have,

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.016
because it's not clear at all

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.856
what model we should be adopting,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.216
and I think there needs to be
much more discourse

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.656
and much more humility
about what we know and what we don't know.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.056
BG: One last question.
The COP21 is going on in Paris.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.576
If you could send a tweet

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.896
to all the heads of state
and heads of delegations there,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.296
what would you say?

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.976
DM: Again, I would be very much
about being open-minded.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.216
As you're aware,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.336
the issues around
the environmental concerns

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.336
have been on the agenda many times now --

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.616
in Copenhagen,
'72 in Stockholm --

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.936
and we keep revisiting these issues

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.536
partly because there is not
a fundamental agreement,

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.816
in fact there's a schism

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.576
between what the developed
countries believe and want

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.936
and what emerging market countries want.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.176
Emerging market countries need
to continue to create economic growth

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.616
so that we don't have political
uncertainty in the those countries.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.776
Developed countries recognize

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.056
that they have a real,
important responsibility

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.896
not only just to manage
their CO2 emissions

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.096
and some of the degradation
that they're contributing to the world,

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.896
but also as trendsetters in R&amp;D.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.176
And so they have to come
to the table as well.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.656
But in essence, it cannot be a situation

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.816
where we start ascribing policies
to the emerging markets

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.696
without developed countries themselves

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.096
also taking quite a swipe
at what they're doing

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.896
both in demand and supply
in developed markets.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.016
BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.
DM: Thank you very much.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.483
