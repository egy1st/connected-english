00:00:01.023 --> 00:00:02.666
As a boy in Lima,

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.801
my grandfather told me a legend

00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:07.079
of the Spanish conquest of Peru.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.546
Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca,
had been captured and killed.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.553
Pizarro and his conquistadors
had grown rich,

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:17.763
and tales of their conquest
and glory had reached Spain

00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:23.162
and was bringing new waves of Spaniards,
hungry for gold and glory.

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:26.953
They would go into towns and ask the Inca,

00:00:26.977 --> 00:00:30.752
"Where's another civilization
we can conquer? Where's more gold?"

00:00:30.776 --> 00:00:34.155
And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them,

00:00:34.648 --> 00:00:36.257
"Go to the Amazon.

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:39.413
You'll find all the gold you want there.

00:00:39.437 --> 00:00:44.151
In fact, there is a city called Paititi --
El Dorado in Spanish --

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:46.802
made entirely of gold."

00:00:47.303 --> 00:00:49.199
The Spanish set off into the jungle,

00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:52.785
but the few that return
come back with stories,

00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:57.711
stories of powerful shamans,

00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:00.639
of warriors with poisoned arrows,

00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:04.441
of trees so tall they blotted out the sun,

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:09.217
spiders that ate birds,
snakes that swallowed men whole

00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:11.525
and a river that boiled.

00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:15.779
All this became a childhood memory.

00:01:15.803 --> 00:01:16.962
And years passed.

00:01:16.986 --> 00:01:19.461
I'm working on my PhD at SMU,

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:23.389
trying to understand
Peru's geothermal energy potential,

00:01:23.413 --> 00:01:25.459
when I remember this legend,

00:01:25.483 --> 00:01:27.332
and I began asking that question.

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:30.863
Could the boiling river exist?

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.339
I asked colleagues from universities,

00:01:34.363 --> 00:01:35.520
the government,

00:01:35.544 --> 00:01:37.037
oil, gas and mining companies,

00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:39.967
and the answer was a unanimous no.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.459
And this makes sense.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.698
You see, boiling rivers
do exist in the world,

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:48.181
but they're generally
associated with volcanoes.

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.796
You need a powerful heat source

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.186
to produce such a large
geothermal manifestation.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.414
And as you can see from the red dots
here, which are volcanoes,

00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:02.256
we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.098
nor in most of Peru.

00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:08.390
So it follows: We should not expect
to see a boiling river.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.748
Telling this same story
at a family dinner,

00:02:13.772 --> 00:02:16.242
my aunt tells me,

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:20.248
"But no, Andrés, I've been there.
I've swum in that river."

00:02:20.898 --> 00:02:24.535
(Laughter)

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:26.306
Then my uncle jumps in.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.060
"No, Andrés, she's not kidding.

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:33.067
You see, you can only swim in it
after a very heavy rain,

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:36.337
and it's protected by a powerful shaman.

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:38.678
Your aunt, she's friends with his wife."

00:02:39.257 --> 00:02:41.062
(Laughter)

00:02:41.086 --> 00:02:42.237
"¿Cómo?" ["Huh?"]

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:44.475
You know, despite all
my scientific skepticism,

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:48.931
I found myself hiking into the jungle,
guided by my aunt,

00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:52.852
over 700 kilometers away
from the nearest volcanic center,

00:02:52.876 --> 00:02:56.494
and well, honestly,
mentally preparing myself

00:02:56.518 --> 00:03:00.894
to behold the legendary
"warm stream of the Amazon."

00:03:02.671 --> 00:03:04.292
But then ...

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:05.638
I heard something,

00:03:07.255 --> 00:03:08.704
a low surge

00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:13.042
that got louder and louder

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.260
as we came closer.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.228
It sounded like ocean waves
constantly crashing,

00:03:20.252 --> 00:03:24.937
and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor,
coming up through the trees.

00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:28.260
And then, I saw this.

00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:32.260
I immediately grabbed for my thermometer,

00:03:32.284 --> 00:03:35.561
and the average temperatures in the river

00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:37.572
were 86 degrees C.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.807
This is not quite
the 100-degree C boiling

00:03:42.831 --> 00:03:45.708
but definitely close enough.

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:49.388
The river flowed hot and fast.

00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:53.829
I followed it upriver and was led by,
actually, the shaman's apprentice

00:03:53.853 --> 00:03:55.637
to the most sacred site on the river.

00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:57.067
And this is what's bizarre --

00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:59.073
It starts off as a cold stream.

00:03:59.502 --> 00:04:01.739
And here, at this site,

00:04:01.763 --> 00:04:03.930
is the home of the Yacumama,

00:04:03.954 --> 00:04:07.297
mother of the waters,
a giant serpent spirit

00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:09.394
who births hot and cold water.

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:14.427
And here we find a hot spring,

00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:19.809
mixing with cold stream water
underneath her protective motherly jaws

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:23.078
and thus bringing their legends to life.

00:04:24.283 --> 00:04:26.261
The next morning, I woke up and --

00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:28.504
(Laughter)

00:04:28.528 --> 00:04:30.559
I asked for tea.

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.823
I was handed a mug, a tea bag

00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:35.175
and, well, pointed towards the river.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:40.584
To my surprise, the water was clean
and had a pleasant taste,

00:04:40.608 --> 00:04:43.602
which is a little weird
for geothermal systems.

00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:45.989
What was amazing

00:04:46.013 --> 00:04:48.997
is that the locals had always
known about this place,

00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:52.725
and that I was by no means
the first outsider to see it.

00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:56.638
It was just part of their everyday life.

00:04:57.115 --> 00:04:59.809
They drink its water.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.388
They take in its vapor.

00:05:02.412 --> 00:05:04.103
They cook with it,

00:05:04.127 --> 00:05:05.637
clean with it,

00:05:05.661 --> 00:05:07.459
even make their medicines with it.

00:05:09.094 --> 00:05:10.840
I met the shaman,

00:05:10.864 --> 00:05:15.053
and he seemed like an extension
of the river and his jungle.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:17.672
He asked for my intentions

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:20.188
and listened carefully.

00:05:21.262 --> 00:05:24.373
Then, to my tremendous relief --

00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:27.944
I was freaking out,
to be honest with you --

00:05:27.968 --> 00:05:32.247
a smile began to snake across his face,
and he just laughed.

00:05:32.271 --> 00:05:34.568
(Laughter)

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:40.391
I had received the shaman's blessing
to study the river,

00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:43.819
on the condition that after I take
the water samples

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.359
and analyze them in my lab,

00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:47.193
wherever I was in the world,

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:52.031
that I pour the waters
back into the ground

00:05:52.055 --> 00:05:54.102
so that, as the shaman said,

00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:56.871
the waters could find their way back home.

00:05:59.272 --> 00:06:02.859
I've been back every year
since that first visit in 2011,

00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:06.308
and the fieldwork has been exhilarating,

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:10.129
demanding and at times dangerous.

00:06:10.913 --> 00:06:14.128
One story was even featured
in National Geographic Magazine.

00:06:14.152 --> 00:06:18.239
I was trapped on a small rock
about the size of a sheet of paper

00:06:18.263 --> 00:06:20.303
in sandals and board shorts,

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:22.733
in between an 80 degree C river

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:26.486
and a hot spring that, well,
looked like this, close to boiling.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.608
And on top of that,
it was Amazon rain forest.

00:06:31.206 --> 00:06:33.712
Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.

00:06:33.736 --> 00:06:37.298
The temperature differential
made it all white. It was a whiteout.

00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:40.361
Intense.

00:06:42.158 --> 00:06:44.596
Now, after years of work,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.262
I'll soon be submitting my geophysical
and geochemical studies for publication.

00:06:51.047 --> 00:06:55.022
And I'd like to share, today,
with all of you here, on the TED stage,

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:58.236
for the first time,
some of these discoveries.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.871
Well, first off, it's not a legend.

00:07:02.468 --> 00:07:03.642
Surprise!

00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:05.991
(Laughter)

00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:08.529
When I first started the research,

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.532
the satellite imagery was too
low-resolution to be meaningful.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.184
There were just no good maps.

00:07:13.754 --> 00:07:16.145
Thanks to the support
of the Google Earth team,

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.514
I now have this.

00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:24.601
Not only that, the indigenous name
of the river, Shanay-timpishka,

00:07:25.538 --> 00:07:28.268
"boiled with the heat of the sun,"

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.919
indicating that I'm not the first
to wonder why the river boils,

00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:38.170
and showing that humanity
has always sought to explain

00:07:38.194 --> 00:07:39.733
the world around us.

00:07:41.526 --> 00:07:43.924
So why does the river boil?

00:07:43.948 --> 00:07:48.361
(Bubbling sounds)

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.880
It actually took me three years
to get that footage.

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.484
Fault-fed hot springs.

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:59.258
As we have hot blood running
through our veins and arteries,

00:07:59.282 --> 00:08:04.330
so, too, the earth has hot water
running through its cracks and faults.

00:08:05.162 --> 00:08:08.757
Where these arteries come to the surface,
these earth arteries,

00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:11.155
we'll get geothermal manifestations:

00:08:11.179 --> 00:08:15.199
fumaroles, hot springs
and in our case, the boiling river.

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:20.559
What's truly incredible, though,
is the scale of this place.

00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:23.567
Next time you cross the road,
think about this.

00:08:24.527 --> 00:08:27.199
The river flows wider than a two-lane road

00:08:27.223 --> 00:08:29.087
along most of its path.

00:08:29.674 --> 00:08:35.017
It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.

00:08:36.223 --> 00:08:37.732
Truly impressive.

00:08:39.077 --> 00:08:42.077
There are thermal pools
larger than this TED stage,

00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:44.577
and that waterfall that you see there

00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:46.639
is six meters tall --

00:08:47.384 --> 00:08:50.676
and all with near-boiling water.

00:08:52.243 --> 00:08:54.299
We mapped the temperatures
along the river,

00:08:54.323 --> 00:08:57.441
and this was by far the most
demanding part of the fieldwork.

00:08:57.866 --> 00:09:01.553
And the results were just awesome.

00:09:01.577 --> 00:09:04.730
Sorry -- the geoscientist
in me coming out.

00:09:04.754 --> 00:09:07.180
And it showed this amazing trend.

00:09:07.204 --> 00:09:09.420
You see, the river starts off cold.

00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:12.439
It then heats up, cools back down,
heats up, cools back down,

00:09:12.463 --> 00:09:15.081
heats up again, and then has
this beautiful decay curve

00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:17.477
until it smashes into this cold river.

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:21.333
Now, I understand not all of you
are geothermal scientists,

00:09:21.357 --> 00:09:23.582
so to put it in more everyday terms:

00:09:24.225 --> 00:09:26.358
Everyone loves coffee.

00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:27.651
Yes? Good.

00:09:28.517 --> 00:09:32.200
Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,

00:09:32.224 --> 00:09:34.334
an extra-hot one, well, 60.

00:09:34.896 --> 00:09:37.067
So, put in coffee shop terms,

00:09:37.091 --> 00:09:39.654
the boiling river plots like this.

00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:41.900
There you have your hot coffee.

00:09:42.906 --> 00:09:44.630
Here you have your extra-hot coffee,

00:09:44.654 --> 00:09:46.828
and you can see
that there's a bit point there

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.840
where the river is still hotter
than even the extra-hot coffee.

00:09:49.864 --> 00:09:51.856
And these are average water temperatures.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.079
We took these in the dry season to ensure
the purest geothermal temperatures.

00:09:56.603 --> 00:09:59.223
But there's a magic number here
that's not being shown,

00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:01.777
and that number is 47 degrees C,

00:10:02.856 --> 00:10:05.378
because that's where things start to hurt,

00:10:05.402 --> 00:10:09.575
and I know this from very
personal experience.

00:10:10.186 --> 00:10:13.012
Above that temperature,
you don't want to get in that water.

00:10:13.036 --> 00:10:14.698
You need to be careful.

00:10:14.722 --> 00:10:16.037
It can be deadly.

00:10:16.704 --> 00:10:18.995
I've seen all sorts of animals fall in,

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:23.198
and what's shocking to me,
is the process is pretty much the same.

00:10:23.898 --> 00:10:26.579
So they fall in and the first thing
to go are the eyes.

00:10:26.603 --> 00:10:29.970
Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly.
They turn this milky-white color.

00:10:29.994 --> 00:10:31.344
The stream is carrying them.

00:10:31.368 --> 00:10:34.431
They're trying to swim out,
but their meat is cooking on the bone

00:10:34.455 --> 00:10:35.621
because it's so hot.

00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:37.490
So they're losing power, losing power,

00:10:37.514 --> 00:10:40.904
until finally they get to a point
where hot water goes into their mouths

00:10:40.928 --> 00:10:43.149
and they cook from the inside out.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.672
(Laughter)

00:10:48.696 --> 00:10:50.815
A bit sadistic, aren't we?

00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:52.179
Jeez.

00:10:53.362 --> 00:10:55.980
Leave them marinating for a little longer.

00:10:57.468 --> 00:11:00.196
What's, again, amazing
are these temperatures.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.698
They're similar to things that I've seen
on volcanoes all over the world

00:11:03.722 --> 00:11:06.259
and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.

00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:08.204
But here's the thing:

00:11:10.173 --> 00:11:15.172
the data is showing
that the boiling river exists

00:11:15.196 --> 00:11:17.486
independent of volcanism.

00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:21.911
It's neither magmatic
or volcanic in origin,

00:11:23.722 --> 00:11:29.925
and again, over 700 kilometers away
from the nearest volcanic center.

00:11:30.543 --> 00:11:34.909
How can a boiling river exist like this?

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.946
I've asked geothermal experts
and volcanologists for years,

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.787
and I'm still unable to find another
non-volcanic geothermal system

00:11:43.811 --> 00:11:45.378
of this magnitude.

00:11:47.121 --> 00:11:48.645
It's unique.

00:11:49.489 --> 00:11:52.931
It's special on a global scale.

00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:57.176
So, still -- how does it work?

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.596
Where do we get this heat?

00:12:01.186 --> 00:12:03.279
There's still more research to be done

00:12:03.303 --> 00:12:06.492
to better constrain the problem
and better understand the system,

00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:08.842
but from what the data is telling us now,

00:12:08.866 --> 00:12:12.230
it looks to be the result
of a large hydrothermal system.

00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:14.611
Basically, it works like this:

00:12:14.635 --> 00:12:17.943
So, the deeper you go
into the earth, the hotter it gets.

00:12:17.967 --> 00:12:20.595
We refer to this
as the geothermal gradient.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:26.388
The waters could be coming
from as far away as glaciers in the Andes,

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.411
then seeping down deep into the earth

00:12:28.435 --> 00:12:31.202
and coming out to form the boiling river

00:12:31.226 --> 00:12:34.233
after getting heated up
from the geothermal gradient,

00:12:35.311 --> 00:12:37.550
all due to this unique geologic setting.

00:12:38.587 --> 00:12:41.434
Now, we found
that in and around the river --

00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:42.951
this is working with colleagues

00:12:42.975 --> 00:12:45.062
from National Geographic,
Dr. Spencer Wells,

00:12:45.086 --> 00:12:47.796
and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis --

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.082
we genetically sequenced
the extremophile lifeforms

00:12:51.106 --> 00:12:55.710
living in and around the river,
and have found new lifeforms,

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:59.149
unique species living
in the boiling river.

00:13:00.264 --> 00:13:05.507
But again, despite all of these studies,
all of these discoveries and the legends,

00:13:06.499 --> 00:13:07.499
a question remains:

00:13:09.704 --> 00:13:12.624
What is the significance
of the boiling river?

00:13:14.601 --> 00:13:19.247
What is the significance
of this stationary cloud

00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:22.147
that always hovers
over this patch of jungle?

00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:25.983
And what is the significance

00:13:26.007 --> 00:13:28.990
of a detail in a childhood legend?

00:13:31.547 --> 00:13:34.655
To the shaman and his community,
it's a sacred site.

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:37.759
To me, as a geoscientist,

00:13:37.783 --> 00:13:40.626
it's a unique geothermal phenomenon.

00:13:42.074 --> 00:13:45.772
But to the illegal loggers
and cattle farmers,

00:13:45.796 --> 00:13:49.439
it's just another resource to exploit.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.607
And to the Peruvian government,
it's just another stretch

00:13:54.631 --> 00:14:00.575
of unprotected land ready for development.

00:14:02.186 --> 00:14:05.782
My goal is to ensure
that whoever controls this land

00:14:05.806 --> 00:14:09.924
understands the boiling river's
uniqueness and significance.

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.630
Because that's the question,

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.487
one of significance.

00:14:16.568 --> 00:14:18.897
And the thing there is,

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.191
we define significance.

00:14:22.998 --> 00:14:25.658
It's us. We have that power.

00:14:25.682 --> 00:14:28.410
We are the ones who draw that line

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:30.782
between the sacred and the trivial.

00:14:31.736 --> 00:14:34.012
And in this age,

00:14:34.036 --> 00:14:37.534
where everything seems mapped,
measured and studied,

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.756
in this age of information,

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:46.471
I remind you all that discoveries
are not just made

00:14:46.495 --> 00:14:51.058
in the black void of the unknown

00:14:52.153 --> 00:14:55.562
but in the white noise
of overwhelming data.

00:14:57.862 --> 00:15:00.847
There remains so much to explore.

00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.453
We live in an incredible world.

00:15:05.477 --> 00:15:06.996
So go out.

00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:10.163
Be curious.

00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:14.754
Because we do live in a world

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:18.819
where shamans still sing
to the spirits of the jungle,

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:22.240
where rivers do boil

00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:25.835
and where legends do come to life.

00:15:27.018 --> 00:15:28.199
Thank you very much.

00:15:28.223 --> 00:15:36.809
(Applause)
