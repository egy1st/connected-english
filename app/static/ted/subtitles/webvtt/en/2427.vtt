WEBVTT

00:00:00.823 --> 00:00:03.191
So I come from the tallest
people on the planet --

00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:04.365
the Dutch.

00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:07.069
It hasn't always been this way.

00:00:07.093 --> 00:00:10.307
In fact, all across the globe,
people have been gaining height.

00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:11.894
In the last 150 years,

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:13.079
in developed countries,

00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:15.611
on average, we have gotten
10 centimeters taller.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.918
And scientists have a lot
of theories about why this is,

00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:21.362
but almost all of them involve nutrition,

00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:23.670
namely the increase of dairy and meat.

00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:25.940
In the last 50 years,

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:28.838
global meat consumption
has more than quadrupled,

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.189
from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.

00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:36.436
Something similar has been going on
with milk and eggs.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.029
In every society where incomes have risen,
so has protein consumption.

00:00:41.053 --> 00:00:43.982
And we know that globally,
we are getting richer.

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:47.211
And as the middle class is on the rise,
so is our global population,

00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:52.186
from 7 billion of us today
to 9.7 billion by 2050,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.673
which means that by 2050,

00:00:53.697 --> 00:00:56.224
we are going to need at least
70 percent more protein

00:00:56.248 --> 00:00:58.681
than what is available to humankind today.

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:02.341
And the latest prediction of the UN
puts that population number,

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:04.825
by the end of this century, at 11 billion,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.809
which means that we are going
to need a lot more protein.

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.566
This challenge is staggering --

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.397
so much so, that recently,

00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:15.539
a team at Anglia Ruskin
Global Sustainability Institute suggested

00:01:15.563 --> 00:01:17.699
that if we don't change
our global policies

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:19.271
and food production systems,

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:22.557
our societies might actually collapse
in the next 30 years.

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:28.463
Currently, our ocean serves
as the main source of animal protein.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:32.169
Over 2.6 billion people
depend on it every single day.

00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:34.360
At the same time,

00:01:34.384 --> 00:01:37.035
our global fisheries
are two-and-a-half times larger

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:39.583
than what our oceans
can sustainably support,

00:01:39.607 --> 00:01:42.329
meaning that humans take
far more fish from the ocean

00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:44.657
than the oceans can naturally replace.

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:49.473
WWF recently published a report
showing that just in the last 40 years,

00:01:49.497 --> 00:01:52.087
our global marine life
has been slashed in half.

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:57.298
And another recent report suggests
that of our largest predatory species,

00:01:57.322 --> 00:01:59.670
such as swordfish and bluefin tuna,

00:01:59.694 --> 00:02:02.944
over 90 percent has disappeared
since the 1950s.

00:02:03.653 --> 00:02:07.426
And there are a lot of great, sustainable
fishing initiatives across the planet

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.056
working towards better practices
and better-managed fisheries.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.231
But ultimately,

00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:15.857
all of these initiatives are working
towards keeping current catch constant.

00:02:16.564 --> 00:02:17.715
It's unlikely,

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.529
even with the best-managed fisheries,

00:02:19.553 --> 00:02:22.516
that we are going to be able to take
much more from the ocean

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.695
than we do today.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.464
We have to stop plundering
our oceans the way we have.

00:02:26.488 --> 00:02:28.646
We need to alleviate the pressure on it.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.988
And we are at a point

00:02:30.012 --> 00:02:32.777
where if we push much harder
for more produce,

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:34.500
we might face total collapse.

00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:39.869
Our current systems are not going to feed
a growing global population.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.129
So how do we fix this?

00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:44.891
What's the world going to look like
in just 35 short years

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:48.514
when there's 2.7 billion more of us
sharing the same resources?

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:50.931
We could all become vegan.

00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:52.708
Sounds like a great idea,

00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:54.036
but it's not realistic

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.405
and it's impossibly hard
to mandate globally.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:03:00.013
People are eating animal protein
whether we like it or not.

00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:02.396
And suppose we fail to change our ways

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.546
and continue on the current path,

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.404
failing to meet demands.

00:03:06.428 --> 00:03:08.650
The World Health Organization
recently reported

00:03:08.674 --> 00:03:12.836
that 800 million people are suffering
from malnutrition and food shortage,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.271
which is due to that same
growing, global population

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:20.317
and the declining access to resources
like water, energy and land.

00:03:21.212 --> 00:03:23.272
It takes very little imagination

00:03:23.296 --> 00:03:28.246
to picture a world of global unrest,
riots and further malnutrition.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.896
People are hungry,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.958
and we are running dangerously low
on natural resources.

00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:34.884
For so, so many reasons,

00:03:34.908 --> 00:03:37.662
we need to change our global
food production systems.

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:39.679
We must do better

00:03:39.703 --> 00:03:40.868
and there is a solution.

00:03:40.892 --> 00:03:43.477
And that solution lies in aquaculture --

00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:47.447
the farming of fish, plants like seaweed,
shellfish and crustaceans.

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.290
As the great ocean hero
Jacques Cousteau once said,

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:53.188
"We must start using the ocean
as farmers instead of hunters.

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:56.742
That's what civilization is all about --
farming instead of hunting."

00:03:57.402 --> 00:03:59.830
Fish is the last food that we hunt.

00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:03.682
And why is it that we keep
hearing phrases like,

00:04:03.706 --> 00:04:05.389
"Life's too short for farmed fish,"

00:04:05.413 --> 00:04:07.001
or, "Wild-caught, of course!"

00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:09.374
over fish that we know
virtually nothing about?

00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:11.609
We don't know what it ate
during its lifetime,

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:13.825
and we don't know what
pollution it encounters.

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.739
And if it was a large predatory species,

00:04:15.773 --> 00:04:18.602
it might have gone through the coast
of Fukushima yesterday.

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:19.970
We don't know.

00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:21.337
Very few people realize

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:25.003
the traceability in fisheries
never goes beyond the hunter

00:04:25.027 --> 00:04:26.542
that caught the wild animal.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.003
But let's back up for a second

00:04:28.027 --> 00:04:30.614
and talk about why fish
is the best food choice.

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:31.789
It's healthy,

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.069
it prevents heart disease,

00:04:33.093 --> 00:04:34.536
it provides key amino acids

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.313
and key fatty acids like Omega-3s,

00:04:37.337 --> 00:04:40.214
which is very different from almost
any other type of meat.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.848
And aside from being healthy,

00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:44.469
it's also a lot more exciting and diverse.

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:47.676
Think about it -- most animal farming
is pretty monotonous.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.351
Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig,

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:54.452
and poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken --
pretty much sums it up.

00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:59.291
And then there's 500 species of fish
being farmed currently.

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:02.243
not that Western supermarkets
reflect that on their shelves,

00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:03.664
but that's beside that point.

00:05:03.688 --> 00:05:06.439
And you can farm fish
in a very healthy manner

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.479
that's good for us, good for the planet
and good for the fish.

00:05:10.062 --> 00:05:11.998
I know I sound fish-obsessed --

00:05:12.022 --> 00:05:14.148
(Laughter)

00:05:14.172 --> 00:05:15.323
Let me explain:

00:05:15.347 --> 00:05:18.506
My brilliant partner and wife,
Amy Novograntz, and I got involved

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.481
in aquaculture a couple of years ago.

00:05:20.505 --> 00:05:22.777
We were inspired by Sylvia Earle,

00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:25.097
who won the TED Prize in 2009.

00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:28.255
We actually met on Mission Blue I
in the Galapagos.

00:05:29.157 --> 00:05:31.094
Amy was there as the TED Prize Director;

00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:34.308
me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands
and concerned citizen,

00:05:34.332 --> 00:05:36.705
love to dive, passion for the oceans.

00:05:37.292 --> 00:05:39.626
Mission Blue truly changed our lives.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.801
We fell in love,

00:05:40.825 --> 00:05:42.301
got married

00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:44.566
and we came away really inspired,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.799
thinking we really want to do something
about ocean conservation --

00:05:47.823 --> 00:05:49.558
something that was meant to last,

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:52.138
that could make a real difference

00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:54.788
and something that we could do together.

00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:59.031
Little did we expect that that would
lead us to fish farming.

00:05:59.741 --> 00:06:01.839
But a few months after
we got off the boat,

00:06:01.863 --> 00:06:04.397
we got to a meeting
at Conservation International,

00:06:04.421 --> 00:06:08.448
where the Director General of WorldFish
was talking about aquaculture,

00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:12.218
asking a room full of environmentalists
to stop turning from it,

00:06:12.242 --> 00:06:14.003
realize what was going on

00:06:14.027 --> 00:06:15.448
and to really get involved

00:06:15.472 --> 00:06:17.584
because aquaculture has the potential

00:06:17.608 --> 00:06:20.694
to be just what our oceans
and populations need.

00:06:21.184 --> 00:06:23.067
We were stunned when we heard the stats

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:25.627
that we didn't know more
about this industry already

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:28.558
and excited about the chance
to help get it right.

00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:30.789
And to talk about stats --

00:06:30.813 --> 00:06:33.589
right now, the amount of fish
consumed globally,

00:06:33.613 --> 00:06:35.669
wild catch and farmed combined,

00:06:35.693 --> 00:06:38.025
is twice the tonnage
of the total amount of beef

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:39.922
produced on planet earth last year.

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:42.746
Every single fishing vessel combined,

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.701
small and large, across the globe,

00:06:44.725 --> 00:06:48.602
together produce about 65 million tons
of wild-caught seafood

00:06:48.626 --> 00:06:50.023
for human consumption.

00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:51.929
Aquaculture this year,

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.532
for the first time in history,

00:06:53.556 --> 00:06:56.413
actually produces more
than what we catch from the wild.

00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:58.025
But now this:

00:06:58.049 --> 00:06:59.403
Demand is going to go up.

00:07:00.157 --> 00:07:01.666
In the next 35 years,

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.685
we are going to need an additional
85 million tons to meet demand,

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:09.304
which is one-and-a-half times
as much, almost,

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.887
as what we catch globally
out of our oceans.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.466
An enormous number.

00:07:14.812 --> 00:07:17.911
It's safe to assume that that's not
going to come from the ocean.

00:07:17.935 --> 00:07:19.604
It needs to come from farming.

00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:21.478
And talk about farming --

00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:23.469
for farming you need resources.

00:07:24.313 --> 00:07:27.242
As a human needs to eat
to grow and stay alive,

00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:28.739
so does an animal.

00:07:28.763 --> 00:07:31.658
A cow needs to eat
eight to nine pounds of feed

00:07:31.682 --> 00:07:34.133
and drink almost 8,000 liters of water

00:07:34.157 --> 00:07:36.037
to create just one pound of meat.

00:07:36.535 --> 00:07:38.578
Experts agree that it's impossible

00:07:38.602 --> 00:07:41.754
to farm cows for every
inhabitant on this planet.

00:07:41.778 --> 00:07:44.516
We just don't have enough feed or water.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.294
And we can't keep cutting down
rain forests for it.

00:07:47.318 --> 00:07:50.827
And fresh water -- planet earth
has a very limited supply.

00:07:50.851 --> 00:07:52.962
We need something more efficient

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:55.867
to keep humankind alive on this planet.

00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:58.664
And now let's compare
that with fish farming.

00:07:59.164 --> 00:08:03.102
You can farm one pound of fish
with just one pound of feed,

00:08:03.126 --> 00:08:05.458
and depending on species, even less.

00:08:05.845 --> 00:08:07.075
And why is that?

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:10.868
Well, that's because fish,
first of all, float.

00:08:10.892 --> 00:08:14.478
They don't need to stand around all day
resisting gravity like we do.

00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:16.560
And most fish are cold-blooded --

00:08:16.584 --> 00:08:18.264
they don't need to heat themselves.

00:08:18.288 --> 00:08:19.456
Fish chills.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.101
(Laughter)

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.665
And it needs very little water,

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:23.967
which is counterintuitive,

00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:25.378
but as we say,

00:08:25.402 --> 00:08:27.796
it swims in it but it hardly drinks it.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.233
Fish are the most resource-efficient
animal protein available to humankind,

00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:33.692
aside from insects.

00:08:35.297 --> 00:08:36.911
How much we've learned since.

00:08:37.482 --> 00:08:40.919
For example, on top of that
65 million tons that's annually caught

00:08:40.943 --> 00:08:42.553
for human consumption,

00:08:42.577 --> 00:08:46.564
there's an additional 30 million tons
caught for animal feed,

00:08:46.588 --> 00:08:50.129
mostly sardines and anchovies
for the aquaculture industry

00:08:50.153 --> 00:08:52.190
that's turned into fish meal and fish oil.

00:08:52.602 --> 00:08:53.949
This is madness.

00:08:54.548 --> 00:08:58.120
Sixty-five percent of these fisheries,
globally, are badly managed.

00:08:58.144 --> 00:09:00.854
Some of the worst issues
of our time are connected to it.

00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:02.176
It's destroying our oceans.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.218
The worst slavery issues
imaginable are connected to it.

00:09:05.702 --> 00:09:08.512
Recently, an article came out of Stanford

00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:11.409
saying that if 50 percent
of the world's aquaculture industry

00:09:11.433 --> 00:09:12.735
would stop using fish meal,

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:14.409
our oceans would be saved.

00:09:14.837 --> 00:09:16.492
Now think about that for a minute.

00:09:16.516 --> 00:09:19.536
Now, we know that the oceans
have far more problems --

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.345
they have pollution,
there's acidification,

00:09:22.369 --> 00:09:23.952
coral reef destruction and so on.

00:09:23.976 --> 00:09:26.513
But it underlines the impact
of our fisheries,

00:09:26.537 --> 00:09:29.112
and it underlines how
interconnected everything is.

00:09:29.608 --> 00:09:33.224
Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation,

00:09:33.248 --> 00:09:36.282
climate change, food security and so on.

00:09:36.834 --> 00:09:38.336
In the search for alternatives,

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.415
the industry, on a massive scale,

00:09:40.439 --> 00:09:42.602
has reverted to plant-based alternatives

00:09:42.626 --> 00:09:45.479
like soy, industrial chicken waste,

00:09:45.503 --> 00:09:47.345
blood meal from slaughterhouses

00:09:47.369 --> 00:09:48.624
and so on.

00:09:48.648 --> 00:09:51.112
And we understand where
these choices come from,

00:09:51.136 --> 00:09:53.265
but this is not the right approach.

00:09:53.289 --> 00:09:54.544
It's not sustainable,

00:09:54.568 --> 00:09:55.742
it's not healthy.

00:09:55.766 --> 00:09:58.429
Have you ever seen a chicken
at the bottom of the ocean?

00:09:58.453 --> 00:09:59.804
Of course not.

00:09:59.828 --> 00:10:02.024
If you feed salmon soy with nothing else,

00:10:02.048 --> 00:10:03.810
it literally explodes.

00:10:04.463 --> 00:10:05.615
Salmon is a carnivore,

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:07.534
it has no way to digest soy.

00:10:09.049 --> 00:10:11.171
Now, fish farming is by far

00:10:11.195 --> 00:10:13.512
the best animal farming
available to humankind.

00:10:13.536 --> 00:10:15.908
But it's had a really bad reputation.

00:10:16.373 --> 00:10:18.552
There's been excessive use of chemicals,

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:21.756
there's been virus and disease
transfered to wild populations,

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.109
ecosystem destruction and pollution,

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:26.347
escaped fish breeding
with wild populations,

00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:28.371
altering the overall genetic pool,

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:30.861
and then of course, as just mentioned,

00:10:30.885 --> 00:10:32.964
the unsustainable feed ingredients.

00:10:33.396 --> 00:10:34.639
How blessed were the days

00:10:34.663 --> 00:10:37.110
when we could just enjoy
food that was on our plate,

00:10:37.134 --> 00:10:38.339
whatever it was.

00:10:38.825 --> 00:10:40.364
Once you know, you know.

00:10:40.388 --> 00:10:41.594
You can't go back.

00:10:41.618 --> 00:10:42.769
It's not fun.

00:10:42.793 --> 00:10:45.982
We really need a transparent food
system that we can trust,

00:10:46.006 --> 00:10:47.680
that produces healthy food.

00:10:48.726 --> 00:10:49.925
But the good news is

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:52.862
that decades of development and research

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:55.348
have led to a lot of new
technologies and knowledge

00:10:55.372 --> 00:10:57.184
that allow us to do a lot better.

00:10:57.208 --> 00:10:59.854
We can now farm fish
without any of these issues.

00:11:00.548 --> 00:11:03.429
I think of agriculture
before the green revolution --

00:11:03.453 --> 00:11:06.476
we are at aquaculture
and the blue revolution.

00:11:07.817 --> 00:11:09.054
New technologies means

00:11:09.078 --> 00:11:12.646
that we can now produce a feed
that's perfectly natural,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.854
with a minimal footprint

00:11:13.878 --> 00:11:17.823
that consists of microbes, insects,
seaweeds and micro-algae.

00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:19.992
Healthy for the people,

00:11:20.016 --> 00:11:21.167
healthy for the fish,

00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:22.512
healthy for the planet.

00:11:23.293 --> 00:11:24.443
Microbes, for example,

00:11:24.467 --> 00:11:27.316
can be a perfect alternative
for high-grade fish meal --

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.495
at scale.

00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:30.884
Insects are the --

00:11:30.908 --> 00:11:32.869
well, first of all, the perfect recycling

00:11:32.893 --> 00:11:34.623
because they're grown on food waste;

00:11:34.647 --> 00:11:35.799
but second,

00:11:35.823 --> 00:11:36.974
think of fly-fishing,

00:11:36.998 --> 00:11:40.311
and you know how logical
it actually is to use it as fish feed.

00:11:40.712 --> 00:11:42.735
You don't need large tracts of land for it

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:45.169
and you don't need
to cut down rain forests for it.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.959
And microbes and insects are actually
net water producers.

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:51.738
This revolution is starting as we speak,

00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:53.239
it just needs scale.

00:11:54.492 --> 00:11:57.559
We can now farm far more
species than ever before

00:11:57.583 --> 00:12:01.220
in controlled, natural conditions,
creating happy fish.

00:12:01.897 --> 00:12:03.181
I imagine, for example,

00:12:03.205 --> 00:12:08.813
a closed system that's performing
more efficiently than insect farming,

00:12:08.837 --> 00:12:12.081
where you can produce
healthy, happy, delicious fish

00:12:12.105 --> 00:12:13.477
with little or no effluent,

00:12:13.501 --> 00:12:15.961
almost no energy and almost no water

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:18.294
and a natural feed
with a minimal footprint.

00:12:19.084 --> 00:12:22.311
Or a system where you grow
up to 10 species next to each other --

00:12:22.335 --> 00:12:23.711
off of each other,

00:12:23.735 --> 00:12:25.175
mimicking nature.

00:12:25.918 --> 00:12:27.288
You need very little feed,

00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:28.534
very little footprint.

00:12:28.558 --> 00:12:32.459
I think of seaweed growing
off the effluent of fish, for example.

00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:37.248
There's great technologies
popping up all over the globe.

00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:39.753
From alternatives to battle disease

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:42.642
so we don't need antibiotics
and chemicals anymore,

00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:46.322
to automated feeders that feel
when the fish are hungry,

00:12:46.346 --> 00:12:49.637
so we can save on feed
and create less pollution.

00:12:50.016 --> 00:12:52.619
Software systems that gather
data across farms,

00:12:52.643 --> 00:12:54.529
so we can improve farm practices.

00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:57.983
There's really cool stuff
happening all over the globe.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.313
And make no mistake --
all of these things are possible

00:13:01.337 --> 00:13:04.472
at a cost that's competitive
to what a farmer spends today.

00:13:05.024 --> 00:13:08.971
Tomorrow, there will be no excuse
for anyone to not do the right thing.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:12.423
So somebody needs to connect the dots

00:13:12.447 --> 00:13:15.030
and give these developments
a big kick in the butt.

00:13:15.054 --> 00:13:18.071
And that's what we've been working on
the last couple of years,

00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:20.581
and that's what we need
to be working on together --

00:13:21.049 --> 00:13:23.400
rethinking everything from the ground up,

00:13:23.424 --> 00:13:25.943
with a holistic view
across the value chain,

00:13:25.967 --> 00:13:28.101
connecting all these things
across the globe,

00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:30.173
alongside great entrepreneurs

00:13:30.197 --> 00:13:32.770
that are willing to share
a collective vision.

00:13:33.474 --> 00:13:36.307
Now is the time to create
change in this industry

00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:38.542
and to push it into
a sustainable direction.

00:13:38.566 --> 00:13:39.988
This industry is still young,

00:13:40.012 --> 00:13:41.704
much of its growth is still ahead.

00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:44.875
It's a big task, but not
as far-fetched as you might think.

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:46.049
It's possible.

00:13:47.032 --> 00:13:49.209
So we need to take pressure off the ocean.

00:13:49.233 --> 00:13:50.780
We want to eat good and healthy.

00:13:50.804 --> 00:13:52.876
And if we eat an animal,
it needs to be one

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.558
that had a happy and healthy life.

00:13:54.582 --> 00:13:56.789
We need to have a meal that we can trust,

00:13:56.813 --> 00:13:58.026
live long lives.

00:13:58.577 --> 00:14:02.476
And this is not just for people
in San Francisco or Northern Europe --

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.346
this is for all of us.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.030
Even in the poorest countries,

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.564
it's not just about money.

00:14:07.588 --> 00:14:11.404
People prefer something fresh
and healthy that they can trust

00:14:11.428 --> 00:14:15.220
over something that comes from far away
that they know nothing about.

00:14:15.244 --> 00:14:16.560
We're all the same.

00:14:18.267 --> 00:14:19.418
The day will come

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:22.683
where people will realize -- no, demand --
farmed fish on their plate

00:14:22.727 --> 00:14:25.084
that's farmed well
and that's farmed healthy --

00:14:26.204 --> 00:14:27.458
and refuse anything less.

00:14:27.482 --> 00:14:28.851
You can help speed this up.

00:14:29.163 --> 00:14:31.521
Ask questions when you order seafood.

00:14:31.545 --> 00:14:33.402
Where does my fish come from?

00:14:33.426 --> 00:14:34.941
Who raised it,

00:14:34.965 --> 00:14:36.330
and what did it eat?

00:14:37.008 --> 00:14:40.667
Information about where your fish
comes from and how it was produced

00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:42.833
needs to be much more readily available.

00:14:43.663 --> 00:14:46.847
And consumers need to put pressure
on the aquaculture industry

00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:48.163
to do the right thing.

00:14:48.653 --> 00:14:50.696
So every time you order,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.687
ask for detail

00:14:52.711 --> 00:14:55.193
and show that you really care
about what you eat

00:14:55.217 --> 00:14:56.647
and what's been given to you.

00:14:56.999 --> 00:14:59.343
And eventually, they will listen.

00:14:59.367 --> 00:15:01.164
And all of us will benefit.

00:15:01.575 --> 00:15:02.726
Thank you.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.333
(Applause)
