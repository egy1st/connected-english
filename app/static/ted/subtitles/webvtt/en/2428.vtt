00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.056
15 years ago, I volunteered
to participate in a research study

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.616
that involved a genetic test.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.647
When I arrived at the clinic to be tested,

00:00:10.672 --> 00:00:12.320
I was handed a questionnaire.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.296
One of the very first questions
asked me to check a box for my race:

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.920
White, black, Asian, or Native American.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.560
I wasn't quite sure
how to answer the question.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.576
Was it aimed at measuring the diversity

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.176
of research participants'
social backgrounds?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.816
In that case, I would answer
with my social identity,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.840
and check the box for "black."

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.016
But what if the researchers
were interested in investigating

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.136
some association between ancestry
and the risk for certain genetic traits?

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.696
In that case, wouldn't they want to know
something about my ancestry,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.976
which is just as much European as African?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.616
And how could they make
scientific findings about my genes

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.680
if I put down my social identity
as a black woman?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.616
After all, I consider myself
a black woman with a white father

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.056
rather than a white woman
with a black mother

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.360
entirely for social reasons.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.256
Which racial identity I check

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.120
has nothing to do with my genes.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.456
Well, despite the obvious
importance of this question

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.976
to the study's scientific validity,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.536
I was told, "Don't worry about it,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.440
just put down however
you identify yourself."

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.576
So I check "black,"

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.296
but I had no confidence
in the results of a study

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.520
that treated a critical variable
so unscientifically.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.696
That personal experience
with the use of race in genetic testing

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.296
got me thinking:

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.040
Where else in medicine is race used
to make false biological predictions?

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.976
Well, I found out that race runs deeply
throughout all of medical practice.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.015
It shapes physicians' diagnoses,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.656
measurements, treatments,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.296
prescriptions,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.480
even the very definition of diseases.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.360
And the more I found out,
the more disturbed I became.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.816
Sociologists like me have long explained

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.736
that race is a social construction.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.256
When we identify people as black,
white, Asian, Native American, Latina,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.016
we're referring to social groupings

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.736
with made up demarcations
that have changed over time

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.296
and vary around the world.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.536
As a legal scholar, I've also studied

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.976
how lawmakers, not biologists,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.840
have invented the legal
definitions of races.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.096
And it's not just the view
of social scientists.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.736
You remember when the map
of the human genome

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.016
was unveiled at a White House
ceremony in June 2000?

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.656
President Bill Clinton famously declared,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.856
"I believe one of the great truths

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.056
to emerge from this triumphant expedition

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.896
inside the human genome

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.776
is that in genetic terms,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.616
human beings, regardless of race,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.160
are more than 99.9 percent the same."

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.496
And he might have added

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.216
that that less than one percent
of genetic difference

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.760
doesn't fall into racial boxes.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.096
Francis Collins, who led
the Human Genome Project

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.816
and now heads NIH,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.896
echoed President Clinton.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.856
"I am happy that today,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.720
the only race we're talking about
is the human race."

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.376
Doctors are supposed to practice
evidence-based medicine,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.336
and they're increasingly called
to join the genomic revolution.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.240
But their habit of treating patients
by race lags far behind.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.416
Take the estimate

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.696
of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.256
Doctors routinely interpret GFR,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.520
this important indicator
of kidney function, by race.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.079
As you can see in this lab test,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.896
the exact same creatinine level,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.696
the concentration
in the blood of the patient,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.176
automatically produces
a different GFR estimate

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.680
depending on whether or not
the patient is African-American.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.320
Why?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.536
I've been told it's based on an assumption

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.656
that African-Americans
have more muscle mass

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.880
than people of other races.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.696
But what sense does it make

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.176
for a doctor to automatically assume

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.080
I have more muscle mass
than that female bodybuilder?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.576
Wouldn't it be far more accurate
and evidence-based

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.616
to determine the muscle mass
of individual patients

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.680
just by looking at them?

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.776
Well, doctors tell me
they're using race as a shortcut.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.536
It's a crude but convenient proxy

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.816
for more important factors,
like muscle mass,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.216
enzyme level, genetic traits

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.520
they just don't have time to look for.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.376
But race is a bad proxy.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.536
In many cases, race adds
no relevant information at all.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.440
It's just a distraction.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.480
But race also tends to overwhelm
the clinical measures.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.120
It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.440
family illnesses,

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.776
their history, their own illnesses
they might have --

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.320
all more evidence-based
than the patient's race.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.696
Race can't substitute
for these important clinical measures

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.400
without sacrificing patient well-being.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.456
Doctors also tell me
race is just one of many factors

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.016
they take into account,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.176
but there are numerous medical tests,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.936
like the GFR,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.216
that use race categorically

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.216
to treat black, white,
Asian patients differently

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.320
just because of their race.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.176
Race medicine also leaves
patients of color especially vulnerable

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.000
to harmful biases and stereotypes.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.896
Black and Latino patients
are twice as likely

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.416
to receive no pain medication as whites

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.016
for the same painful long bone fractures

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.256
because of stereotypes

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.136
that black and brown people
feel less pain,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.096
exaggerate their pain,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.840
and are predisposed to drug addiction.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.976
The Food and Drug Administration has even
approved a race-specific medicine.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.416
It's a pill called BiDil

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.080
to treat heart failure in self-identified
African-American patients.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.816
A cardiologist developed this drug
without regard to race or genetics,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.096
but it became convenient

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.016
for commercial reasons

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.760
to market the drug to black patients.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.616
The FDA then allowed

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.696
the company, the drug company,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.336
to test the efficacy in a clinical trial

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.920
that only included
African-American subjects.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.536
It speculated

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.656
that race stood in as a proxy
for some unknown genetic factor

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.456
that affects heart disease

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.240
or response to drugs.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.016
But think about
the dangerous message it sent,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.496
that black people's bodies
are so substandard,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.216
a drug tested in them

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.720
is not guaranteed
to work in other patients.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.656
In the end, the drug company's
marketing scheme failed.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.656
For one thing, black patients
were understandably wary

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.056
of using a drug just for black people.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.016
One elderly black woman stood up
in a community meeting and shouted,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.496
"Give me what the white
people are taking!"

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.000
(Laughter)

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:39.360
And if you find race-specific
medicine surprising,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.135
wait until you learn

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.976
that many doctors in the United States

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.136
still use an updated version

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.056
of a diagnostic tool

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.536
that was developed by a physician
during the slavery era,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.856
a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.240
to justifications for slavery.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.216
Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.616
from the University
of Pennsylvania Medical School.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.216
He practiced in the Deep South
before the Civil War,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.360
and he was a well-known expert
on what was then called "Negro medicine."

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.336
He promoted the racial concept of disease,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.056
that people of different races
suffer from different diseases

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.720
and experience
common diseases differently.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.136
Cartwright argued in the 1850s

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.176
that slavery was beneficial
for black people

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.256
for medical reasons.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.176
He claimed that because black people
have lower lung capacity than whites,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.760
forced labor was good for them.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.096
He wrote in a medical journal,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.536
"It is the red vital blood
sent to the brain

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.896
that liberates their minds
when under the white man's control,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.656
and it is the want of sufficiency
of red vital blood

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.080
that chains their minds to ignorance
and barbarism when in freedom."

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.296
To support this theory,
Cartwright helped to perfect

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.160
a medical device for measuring breathing
called the spirometer

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.280
to show the presumed deficiency
in black people's lungs.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:25.416
Today, doctors still
uphold Cartwright's claim

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.056
the black people as a race

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.080
have lower lung capacity
than white people.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.576
Some even use a modern day spirometer

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.336
that actually has a button labeled "race"

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.016
so the machine adjusts the measurement

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.016
for each patient
according to his or her race.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.880
It's a well-known function
called "correcting for race."

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.360
The problem with race medicine
extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.376
Its focus on innate
racial differences in disease

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.496
diverts attention and resources

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.736
from the social determinants

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.736
that cause appalling
racial gaps in health:

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.080
lack of access
to high-quality medical care;

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.400
food deserts in poor neighborhoods;

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.440
exposure to environmental toxins;

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.280
high rates of incarceration;

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.280
and experiencing the stress
of racial discrimination.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.896
You see, race is not a biological category

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.336
that naturally produces
these health disparities

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.600
because of genetic difference.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.856
Race is a social category

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.536
that has staggering
biological consequences,

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.480
but because of the impact
of social inequality on people's health.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.296
Yet race medicine pretends
the answer to these gaps in health

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.536
can be found in a race-specific pill.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.296
It's much easier and more lucrative

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.080
to market a technological fix

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.816
for these gaps in health

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.640
than to deal with the structural
inequities that produce them.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.296
The reason I'm so passionate
about ending race medicine

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.376
isn't just because it's bad medicine.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.256
I'm also on this mission

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.216
because the way doctors practice medicine

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.880
continues to promote
a false and toxic view of humanity.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:42.936
Despite the many visionary breakthroughs
in medicine we've been learning about,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.576
there's a failure of imagination

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.320
when it comes to race.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.840
Would you imagine with me, just a moment:

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:58.720
What would happen if doctors
stopped treating patients by race?

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.896
Suppose they rejected

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.616
an 18th-century classification system

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.376
and incorporated instead
the most advanced knowledge

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.336
of human genetic diversity and unity,

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:19.520
that human beings cannot be categorized
into biological races?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.376
What if, instead of using race
as a crude proxy

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.776
for some more important factor,

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.920
doctors actually investigated
and addressed that more important factor?

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.856
What if doctors joined the forefront

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.616
of a movement to end
the structural inequities

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.856
caused by racism,

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.960
not by genetic difference?

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.520
Race medicine is bad medicine,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.296
it's poor science

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.680
and it's a false
interpretation of humanity.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.096
It is more urgent than ever

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.656
to finally abandon this backward legacy

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.096
and to affirm our common humanity

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:16.016
by ending the social inequalities
that truly divide us.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.256
Thank you.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.496
(Applause)

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.400
Thank you. Thanks.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.520
Thank you.
