WEBVTT

00:00:00.896 --> 00:00:02.579
So I'm a neurosurgeon.

00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:05.649
And like most of my colleagues,

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:09.329
I have to deal, every day,
with human tragedies.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.354
I realize how your life can change
from one second to the other

00:00:15.378 --> 00:00:19.423
after a major stroke
or after a car accident.

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:23.783
And what is very frustrating
for us neurosurgeons

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:28.427
is to realize that unlike
other organs of the body,

00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:31.930
the brain has very little
ability for self-repair.

00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:37.125
And after a major injury
of your central nervous system,

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:42.125
the patients often remain
with a severe handicap.

00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:45.416
And that's probably
the reason why I've chosen

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.103
to be a functional neurosurgeon.

00:00:49.144 --> 00:00:51.052
What is a functional neurosurgeon?

00:00:51.978 --> 00:00:56.338
It's a doctor who is trying to improve
a neurological function

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:58.679
through different surgical strategies.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.376
You've certainly heard of
one of the famous ones

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.486
called deep brain stimulation,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.362
where you implant an electrode
in the depths of the brain

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:12.962
in order to modulate a circuit of neurons

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:14.878
to improve a neurological function.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.396
It's really an amazing technology

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.787
in that it has improved
the destiny of patients

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:22.633
with Parkinson's disease,

00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:25.763
with severe tremor, with severe pain.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.456
However, neuromodulation
does not mean neuro-repair.

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:35.608
And the dream of functional neurosurgeons

00:01:35.632 --> 00:01:37.270
is to repair the brain.

00:01:39.222 --> 00:01:40.619
I think

00:01:40.643 --> 00:01:42.478
that we are approaching this dream.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.135
And I would like to show you

00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:47.096
that we are very close to this.

00:01:48.022 --> 00:01:51.133
And that with a little bit of help,

00:01:51.157 --> 00:01:54.524
the brain is able to help itself.

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.685
So the story started 15 years ago.

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:01.176
At that time, I was a chief resident

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.113
working days and nights
in the emergency room.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.828
I often had to take care
of patients with head trauma.

00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:13.654
You have to imagine that when a patient
comes in with a severe head trauma,

00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:15.977
his brain is swelling

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.981
and he's increasing
his intracranial pressure.

00:02:19.716 --> 00:02:21.945
And in order to save his life,

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.777
you have to decrease
this intracranial pressure.

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:25.952
And to do that,

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:29.896
you sometimes have to remove
a piece of swollen brain.

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:34.935
So instead of throwing away
these pieces of swollen brain,

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.448
we decided with Jean-François Brunet,

00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:39.385
who is a colleague of mine, a biologist,

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.583
to study them.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.150
What do I mean by that?

00:02:43.174 --> 00:02:47.207
We wanted to grow cells
from these pieces of tissue.

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:49.903
It's not an easy task.

00:02:50.577 --> 00:02:52.942
Growing cells from a piece of tissue

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:56.425
is a bit the same as growing
very small children

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:57.919
out from their family.

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.006
So you need to find the right nutrients,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.799
the warmth, the humidity

00:03:03.823 --> 00:03:07.059
and all the nice environments
to make them thrive.

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:09.894
So that's exactly what we had
to do with these cells.

00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:12.291
And after many attempts,

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.726
Jean-François did it.

00:03:15.372 --> 00:03:18.569
And that's what he saw
under his microscope.

00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:22.039
And that was, for us, a major surprise.

00:03:22.412 --> 00:03:23.563
Why?

00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:28.429
Because this looks exactly the same
as a stem cell culture,

00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:34.096
with large green cells
surrounding small, immature cells.

00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:38.422
And you may remember from biology class

00:03:38.446 --> 00:03:41.957
that stem cells are immature cells,

00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.860
able to turn into any type
of cell of the body.

00:03:47.423 --> 00:03:52.051
The adult brain has stem cells,
but they're very rare

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:56.454
and they're located
in deep and small niches

00:03:56.478 --> 00:03:58.495
in the depths of the brain.

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.221
So it was surprising to get
this kind of stem cell culture

00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:04.604
from the superficial part
of swollen brain we had

00:04:04.628 --> 00:04:06.245
in the operating theater.

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.875
And there was another
intriguing observation:

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.116
Regular stem cells
are very active cells --

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.713
cells that divide, divide,
divide very quickly.

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.729
And they never die,
they're immortal cells.

00:04:21.407 --> 00:04:23.798
But these cells behave differently.

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:26.846
They divide slowly,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.870
and after a few weeks of culture,

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:30.456
they even died.

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:34.973
So we were in front of a strange
new cell population

00:04:34.997 --> 00:04:38.091
that looked like stem cells
but behaved differently.

00:04:39.052 --> 00:04:43.496
And it took us a long time
to understand where they came from.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.065
They come from these cells.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.993
These blue and red cells are called
doublecortin-positive cells.

00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:54.747
All of you have them in your brain.

00:04:55.353 --> 00:04:59.253
They represent four percent
of your cortical brain cells.

00:04:59.857 --> 00:05:03.929
They have a very important role
during the development stage.

00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:05.708
When you were fetuses,

00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:09.129
they helped your brain to fold itself.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.635
But why do they stay in your head?

00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:14.778
This, we don't know.

00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:18.636
We think that they may
participate in brain repair

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.124
because we find them
in higher concentration

00:05:22.148 --> 00:05:23.300
close to brain lesions.

00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:24.942
But it's not so sure.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.212
But there is one clear thing --

00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:29.833
that from these cells,

00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:32.095
we got our stem cell culture.

00:05:33.363 --> 00:05:35.997
And we were in front
of a potential new source of cells

00:05:36.021 --> 00:05:37.472
to repair the brain.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.561
And we had to prove this.

00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:40.736
So to prove it,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.608
we decided to design
an experimental paradigm.

00:05:44.632 --> 00:05:47.855
The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.578
in a non-eloquent area of the brain,

00:05:50.602 --> 00:05:52.313
and then to culture the cells

00:05:52.337 --> 00:05:55.124
exactly the way Jean-François
did it in his lab.

00:05:55.148 --> 00:05:58.043
And then label them, to put color in them

00:05:58.067 --> 00:06:00.740
in order to be able
to track them in the brain.

00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:03.424
And the last step was to re-implant them

00:06:03.448 --> 00:06:05.231
in the same individual.

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:06.406
We call these

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.231
autologous grafts -- autografts.

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:12.045
So the first question we had,

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.310
"What will happen if we re-implant
these cells in a normal brain,

00:06:17.334 --> 00:06:20.192
and what will happen
if we re-implant the same cells

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:21.439
in a lesioned brain?"

00:06:21.463 --> 00:06:24.852
Thanks to the help
of professor Eric Rouiller,

00:06:24.876 --> 00:06:26.542
we worked with monkeys.

00:06:27.414 --> 00:06:29.854
So in the first-case scenario,

00:06:29.878 --> 00:06:33.383
we re-implanted the cells
in the normal brain

00:06:33.407 --> 00:06:38.442
and what we saw is that they completely
disappeared after a few weeks,

00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:41.420
as if they were taken from the brain,

00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:42.955
they go back home,

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:44.535
the space is already busy,

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:46.789
they are not needed there,
so they disappear.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.758
In the second-case scenario,

00:06:49.782 --> 00:06:51.013
we performed the lesion,

00:06:51.037 --> 00:06:54.177
we re-implanted exactly the same cells,

00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:58.274
and in this case, the cells remained --

00:06:58.298 --> 00:07:01.095
and they became mature neurons.

00:07:01.824 --> 00:07:05.611
And that's the image of what
we could observe under the microscope.

00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:08.189
Those are the cells
that were re-implanted.

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.786
And the proof they carry,

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.987
these little spots, those
are the cells that we've labeled

00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:16.843
in vitro, when they were in culture.

00:07:17.755 --> 00:07:19.955
But we could not stop here, of course.

00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:25.158
Do these cells also help a monkey
to recover after a lesion?

00:07:25.182 --> 00:07:30.664
So for that, we trained monkeys
to perform a manual dexterity task.

00:07:30.688 --> 00:07:33.706
They had to retrieve
food pellets from a tray.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.225
They were very good at it.

00:07:35.896 --> 00:07:39.368
And when they had reached
a plateau of performance,

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:45.687
we did a lesion in the motor cortex
corresponding to the hand motion.

00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:47.568
So the monkeys were plegic,

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.504
they could not move their hand anymore.

00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:53.719
And exactly the same as humans would do,

00:07:53.743 --> 00:07:56.669
they spontaneously recovered
to a certain extent,

00:07:56.693 --> 00:07:58.713
exactly the same as after a stroke.

00:07:58.737 --> 00:08:00.524
Patients are completely plegic,

00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:05.656
and then they try to recover
due to a brain plasticity mechanism,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.320
they recover to a certain extent,

00:08:07.344 --> 00:08:09.185
exactly the same for the monkey.

00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:12.653
So when we were sure that the monkey
had reached his plateau

00:08:12.677 --> 00:08:15.105
of spontaneous recovery,

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:17.704
we implanted his own cells.

00:08:18.287 --> 00:08:23.823
So on the left side, you see the monkey
that has spontaneously recovered.

00:08:25.426 --> 00:08:30.058
He's at about 40 to 50 percent
of his previous performance

00:08:30.082 --> 00:08:31.294
before the lesion.

00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:34.849
He's not so accurate, not so quick.

00:08:35.376 --> 00:08:38.835
And look now when we re-implant the cells:

00:08:38.859 --> 00:08:43.112
Two months after re-implantation,
the same individual.

00:08:45.255 --> 00:08:52.173
(Applause)

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.325
It was also very exciting results
for us, I tell you.

00:08:57.321 --> 00:09:01.027
Since that time, we've understood
much more about these cells.

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:03.971
We know that we can cryopreserve them,

00:09:03.995 --> 00:09:05.857
we can use them later on.

00:09:06.214 --> 00:09:10.104
We know that we can apply them
in other neuropathological models,

00:09:10.128 --> 00:09:12.097
like Parkinson's disease, for example.

00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:15.278
But our dream is still
to implant them in humans.

00:09:16.469 --> 00:09:20.219
And I really hope that I'll be able
to show you soon

00:09:21.605 --> 00:09:26.599
that the human brain is giving us
the tools to repair itself.

00:09:26.623 --> 00:09:27.943
Thank you.

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:33.953
(Applause)

00:09:33.977 --> 00:09:37.279
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,

00:09:37.303 --> 00:09:41.054
and I'm sure that right now, there are
several dozen people in the audience,

00:09:41.078 --> 00:09:42.284
possibly even a majority,

00:09:42.308 --> 00:09:45.056
who are thinking, "I know
somebody who can use this."

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.340
I do, in any case.

00:09:47.364 --> 00:09:49.660
And of course the question is,

00:09:49.684 --> 00:09:51.762
what are the biggest obstacles

00:09:51.786 --> 00:09:54.577
before you can go
into human clinical trials?

00:09:55.665 --> 00:10:01.171
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest
obstacles are regulations. (Laughs)

00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:03.957
So, from these exciting results,
you need to fill out

00:10:03.981 --> 00:10:07.218
about two kilograms of papers and forms

00:10:07.242 --> 00:10:10.290
to be able to go through these
kind of trials.

00:10:10.314 --> 00:10:12.946
BG: Which is understandable,
the brain is delicate, etc.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.328
JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time

00:10:15.352 --> 00:10:19.383
and a lot of patience and almost
a professional team to do it, you know?

00:10:19.407 --> 00:10:21.673
BG: If you project yourself --

00:10:21.697 --> 00:10:22.912
having done the research

00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:26.881
and having tried to get
permission to start the trials,

00:10:26.905 --> 00:10:30.084
if you project yourself out in time,

00:10:30.736 --> 00:10:34.434
how many years before
somebody gets into a hospital

00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:36.631
and this therapy is available?

00:10:37.555 --> 00:10:39.690
JB: So, it's very difficult to say.

00:10:39.714 --> 00:10:43.648
It depends, first,
on the approval of the trial.

00:10:43.672 --> 00:10:46.775
Will the regulation allow us
to do it soon?

00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:49.613
And then, you have to perform
this kind of study

00:10:49.637 --> 00:10:52.437
in a small group of patients.

00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:55.386
So it takes, already, a long time
to select the patients,

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.316
do the treatment

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.069
and evaluate if it's useful
to do this kind of treatment.

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:05.752
And then you have to deploy
this to a multicentric trial.

00:11:05.776 --> 00:11:09.938
You have to really prove
first that it's useful

00:11:09.962 --> 00:11:12.843
before offering this treatment
up for everybody.

00:11:12.867 --> 00:11:14.756
BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.574
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming
to TED and sharing this.

00:11:17.598 --> 00:11:18.749
BG: Thank you.

00:11:18.773 --> 00:11:21.444
(Applause)
