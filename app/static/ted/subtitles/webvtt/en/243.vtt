WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm giving a short slide show this morning

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that I'm giving for the very first time, so --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm actually trying to lower the bar.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Because I've cobbled this together

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to try to meet the challenge of this session.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that religion really properly understood

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
is not about belief, but about behavior.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
How dare we be optimistic?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
"You must become the change you wish to see in the world."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And the outcome about which

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
brings about new behavior. But the word "behavior"

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm a big advocate of changing

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the lightbulbs and buying hybrids,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
it is more important to change the laws.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we sometimes leave out the citizenship part

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
In order to solve the climate crisis,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
we have to solve the democracy crisis.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And we have one.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I was reminded of that recently, by a woman

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
who walked past the table I was sitting at,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
until I saw from the corner of my eye

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
she was walking from the opposite direction,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
also just staring at me. And so I said, "How do you do?"

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
you would look just like Al Gore." (Laughter)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Many years ago, when I was a young congressman,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And the military historians taught me,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
during that quest, that military conflicts are typically

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
put into three categories: local battles,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
global, world war -- strategic conflicts.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
a different approach,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
a different organizational model.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and most of what we think about

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
are local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
hazardous waste dumps. But there are also

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
regional environmental problems, like acid rain

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
from the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
to the Arctic, and from the Midwest

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
is the rare but all-important

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
global, or strategic, conflict.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
appropriately. We need a worldwide, global mobilization

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and a global transition to a low-carbon economy.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and political will. But the political will

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
has to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Let me show you these slides here.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
of course, is the North Polar ice cap.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Greenland remains. Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
This is what's happened in the last 28 years.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
To put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Here's what happened last fall

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that has really unnerved the researchers.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
doesn't look quite the same size --

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
but it is exactly the same size as the United States,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The amount that disappeared in 2005

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
The extra amount that disappeared last fall

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
but not as permanent ice, as thin ice --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
in summer in as little as five years.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Already, around the Arctic Circle --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:52.000
in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
of an area equivalent to the size of California.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
"They were the best of times,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
they were the worst of times": the most famous opening sentence

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
in English literature. I want to share briefly

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
They have exactly the same amount of carbon.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
deposited in the ground as coal, oil,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
natural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is 59 degrees on average. On Venus,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
it's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and putting it into the atmosphere.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It's three times hotter than Mercury,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
The global scientific community says:

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
man-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
thickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
You all know that. At the last

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
"How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent."

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
"more than 90 percent."

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
this could be variations in this energy

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
coming in from the sun." If that were true,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
the stratosphere would be heated as well as the

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
If it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Here's the stratosphere: cooler.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
CSI: Climate.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Now, here's the good news. Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that human activity is responsible

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
for global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
in a significant way. There has been progress,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
but here is the key: when given a list

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:36.000
of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
What is missing is a sense of urgency.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
If you agree with the factual analysis,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
but you don't feel the sense of urgency,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
where does that leave you?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono --

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
This is the winner.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
of the presidential candidates: two of them were about

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
the climate crisis. ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Fox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
From laughs to tears -- this is one of the older

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
tobacco commercials.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So here's what we're doing.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:37.000
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
But it's not just the developed nations.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
The developing countries are now following us

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and accelerating their pace. And actually,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
to where we were in 1965. And they're catching up

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
very dramatically. The total concentrations:

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
If the wealthy countries were completely missing

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
from the picture, we would still have this crisis.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
But we have given to the developing countries

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
the technologies and the ways of thinking

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia --

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
over thirty years.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '60s.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:00.000
'70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
We have the technologies.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this:

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
the struggle against poverty in the world

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
all has a single, very simple solution.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
People say, "What's the solution?" Here it is.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Put a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:39.000
to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck --

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and some things have changed

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
since the 19th century.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000
In the poor world, we have to integrate the responses

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
are mooted, if we do not solve the climate crisis.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.000
But responses can actually make a huge difference

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
in the poor countries. This is a proposal

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
that has been talked about a lot in Europe.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.000
solar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called "supergrid"

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
to supply all of the electrical power

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000
to Europe, largely from developing countries -- high-voltage DC currents.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
This is not pie in the sky; this can be done.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
We need to do it for our own economy.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
The latest figures show that the old model

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
is not working. There are a lot of great investments

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000
or shale oil, then you have a portfolio

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And it is based on an old model.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
that I personally think make sense.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
But geothermal, concentrating solar,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
advanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
You've seen this slide before, but there's a change.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
The only two countries that didn't ratify

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
-- and now there's only one. Australia had an election.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And there was a campaign in Australia

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
that involved television and Internet and radio commercials

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
to lift the sense of urgency for the people there.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
in every town and village and city in Australia.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Lot of other things contributed to it,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
but the new Prime Minister announced that

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
his very first priority would be to change Australia's position

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
on Kyoto, and he has. Now, they came to an awareness

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
partly because of the horrible drought that they have had.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
We can't wait for the kind of drought

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Australia had to change our political culture.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
just to localize this -- which is good news.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Now, to close, we heard a couple of days ago

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:20.000
about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
that it becomes banal or routine.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000
What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
in the United States of America

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
today especially, but also the rest of the world,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
have to somehow understand that history

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:52.000
has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
how to save her life while she was distracted

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
by the amazing experience that she was going through.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
We now have a culture of distraction.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
But we have a planetary emergency.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And we have to find a way to create,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
in the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
I wish I could find the words to convey this.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
This was another hero generation

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
that brought democracy to the planet.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000
We can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
we could be well on the way to solving this challenge.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
We have the capacity to do it.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:14.000
One final point: I'm optimistic, because I believe

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
we have the capacity, at moments of great challenge,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
that history is presenting to us.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
What a burden we have." I would like to ask you

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
to reframe that. How many generations

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
in all of human history have had the opportunity

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:07.000
to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000
A challenge that can pull from us

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:21.000
more than we knew we could do? I think we ought to approach

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
this challenge with a sense of profound joy

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
and gratitude that we are the generation

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
about which, a thousand years from now,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:43.000
philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000
by saying, they were the ones that found it within themselves

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
to solve this crisis and lay the basis

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
for a bright and optimistic human future.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Let's do that. Thank you very much.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Chris Anderson: For so many people at TED, there is deep pain

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
that basically a design issue

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
on a voting form --

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
like that in the last eight years in a position

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
where you could make these things come true.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
That hurts.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Al Gore: You have no idea. (Laughter)

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
CA: When you look at what the leading candidates

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's --

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
are you excited by their plans on global warming?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
AG: The answer to the question is hard for me

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
because, on the one hand, I think that

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
we should feel really great about the fact

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee --

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
John McCain, and both of the finalists

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
and forward-leaning position

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
and all three are very different from the approach taken

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
by the current administration. And I think

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
that all three have also been responsible in

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:07.000
putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that --

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
as illustrated by the questions --

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
that was put together by the

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions --

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
and, by the way, the debates have all been

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
"Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Every single debate has been sponsored by "Clean Coal."

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
"Now, even lower emissions!"

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
The richness and fullness of the dialogue

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
in our democracy has not laid the basis

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
So they're saying the right things and they may --

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
but let me tell you: when I came back from Kyoto

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000
in 1997, with a feeling of great happiness

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
that we'd gotten that breakthrough there,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
and then confronted the United States Senate,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000
to confirm, to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
has to be laid alongside what the people say.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
This challenge is part of the fabric

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
of our whole civilization.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization, literally.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.000
requires a scope, a scale, a speed of change

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
that is beyond what we have done in the past.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
So that's why I began by saying,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Demand -- change the light bulbs,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
but change the laws. Change the global treaties.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy -- this --

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Use the Internet. Go on the Internet.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Connect with people. Become very active as citizens.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Have a moratorium -- we shouldn't

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
have any new coal-fired generating plants

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
that aren't able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
quickly build these renewable sources.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Now, nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
that between now and November, it is possible.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
This Alliance for Climate Protection

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
is going to launch a nationwide campaign --

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
grassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
radio, newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
We need help. We need help.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
CA: In terms of your own personal role going forward,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Al, is there something more than that

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
you would like to be doing?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.000
AG: I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
to that question. What can I do?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Buckminster Fuller once wrote, "If the future

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
of all human civilization depended on me, what would I do?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
How would I be?" It does depend on all of us,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
but again, not just with the light bulbs.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.000
We, most of us here, are Americans. We have a democracy.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
We can change things, but we have to actively change.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
And that's hard to --

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
that's hard to create -- but it is coming.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
There's an old African proverb that some of you know

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone;

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:05.000
if you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
So we have to have a change in consciousness.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
A new appreciation for the privilege

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
that we have of undertaking this challenge.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
CA: Al Gore, thank you so much for coming to TED.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
AG: Thank you. Thank you very much.
