00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.456
On January 26, 2013,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.976
a band of al-Qaeda militants
entered the ancient city of Timbuktu

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.256
There, they set fire to a medieval library
of 30,000 manuscripts

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.056
written in Arabic
and several African languages

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.816
and ranging in subject from astronomy
to geography, history to medicine,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.536
including one book which records

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.480
perhaps the first treatment
for male erectile dysfunction.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.056
Unknown in the West,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.496
this was the collected wisdom
of an entire continent,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.600
the voice of Africa at a time when Africa
was thought not to have a voice at all.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.976
The mayor of Bamako,
who witnessed the event,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.936
called the burning of the manuscripts

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.200
"a crime against world cultural heritage."

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.416
And he was right --

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.880
or he would have been, if it weren't
for the fact that he was also lying.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.296
In fact, just before,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.456
African scholars had collected
a random assortment of old books

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.976
and left them out
for the terrorists to burn.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.936
Today, the collection
lies hidden in Bamako,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.336
the capital of Mali,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.456
moldering in the high humidity.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.336
What was rescued by ruse

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.096
is now once again in jeopardy,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.360
this time by climate.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.616
But Africa, and the far-flung
corners of the world,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.936
are not the only places,
or even the main places

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.256
in which manuscripts that could change
the history of world culture

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.800
are in jeopardy.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.656
Several years ago, I conducted
a survey of European research libraries

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.936
and discovered that,
at the barest minimum,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.176
there are 60,000 manuscripts

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.816
pre-1500

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.776
that are illegible
because of water damage,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.776
fading, mold and chemical reagents.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.776
The real number is likely double that,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.976
and that doesn't even count

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.616
Renaissance manuscripts
and modern manuscripts

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.760
and cultural heritage
objects such as maps.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.416
What if there were a technology

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.776
that could recover
these lost and unknown works?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.216
Imagine worldwide
how a trove of hundreds of thousands

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.176
of previously unknown texts

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.240
could radically transform
our knowledge of the past.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.296
Imagine what unknown classics
we would discover

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.656
which would rewrite the canons
of literature, history,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.120
philosophy, music --

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.376
or, more provocatively, that could
rewrite our cultural identities,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.760
building new bridges
between people and culture.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.056
These are the questions
that transformed me

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.896
from a medieval scholar,
a reader of texts,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.720
into a textual scientist.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.416
What an unsatisfying word "reader" is.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.016
For me, it conjures up
images of passivity,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.456
of someone sitting idly in an armchair

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.776
waiting for knowledge to come to him

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.496
in a neat little parcel.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.536
How much better to be
a participant in the past,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.736
an adventurer in an undiscovered country,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.160
searching for the hidden text.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.800
As an academic, I was a mere reader.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.976
I read and taught the same classics

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.136
that people had been reading
and teaching for hundreds of years --

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.176
Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch --

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.536
and with every scholarly article
that I published

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.760
I added to human knowledge
in ever-diminishing slivers of insight.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.336
What I wanted to be

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.456
was an archaeologist of the past,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.056
a discoverer of literature,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.976
an Indiana Jones without the whip --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.496
or, actually, with the whip.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.736
(Laughter)

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.456
And I wanted it not just for myself
but I wanted it for my students as well.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.376
And so six years ago,
I changed the direction of my career.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.416
At the time, I was working
on "The Chess of Love,"

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.296
the last important long poem
of the European Middle Ages

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.936
never to have been edited.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.976
And it wasn't edited because
it existed in only one manuscript

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.256
which was so badly damaged
during the firebombing of Dresden

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.496
in World War II

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.400
that generations of scholars
had pronounced it lost.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.856
For five years, I had been working
with an ultraviolet lamp

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.776
trying to recover traces of the writing

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.216
and I'd gone about as far
as technology at the time

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.616
could actually take me.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.736
And so I did what many people do.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.776
I went online,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.536
and there I learned about

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.136
how multispectral imaging had been used
to recover two lost treatises

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.056
of the famed Greek
mathematician Archimedes

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.616
from a 13th-century palimpsest.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.920
A palimpsest is a manuscript
which has been erased and overwritten.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.456
And so, out of the blue,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.536
I decided to write
to the lead imaging scientist

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.776
on the Archimedes palimpsest project,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.296
Professor Roger Easton,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.136
with a plan and a plea.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.200
And to my surprise,
he actually wrote back.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.656
With his help, I was able
to win a grant from the US government

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.696
to build a transportable,
multispectral imaging lab,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.536
And with this lab, I transformed
what was a charred and faded mess

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.560
into a new medieval classic.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.136
So how does multispectral
imaging actually work?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.616
Well, the idea
behind multispectral imaging

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.936
is something that anyone who is familiar
with infrared night vision goggles

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.336
will immediately appreciate:

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.856
that what we can see
in the visible spectrum of light

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.200
is only a tiny fraction
of what's actually there.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.920
The same is true with invisible writing.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.456
Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.976
between the ultraviolet and the infrared,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.056
and these are shown down
onto the manuscript from above

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.696
from banks of LEDs,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.576
and another multispectral light source

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.553
which comes up through
the individual leaves of the manuscript.

00:05:35.577 --> 00:05:40.096
Up to 35 images per sequence
per leaf are imaged this way

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.740
using a high-powered digital camera
equipped with a lens

00:05:42.764 --> 00:05:44.736
which is made out of quartz.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.856
There are about five
of these in the world.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.696
And once we capture these images,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.776
we feed them through
statistical algorithms

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.296
to further enhance and clarify them,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.696
using software which was originally
designed for satellite images

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.096
and used by people
like geospatial scientists

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.320
and the CIA.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.336
The results can be spectacular.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.536
You may already have heard
of what's been done

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.936
for the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.520
which are slowly gelatinizing.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.136
Using infrared, we've been able
to read even the darkest corners

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.880
of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.336
You may not be aware, however,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.096
of other Biblical texts
that are in jeopardy.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.536
Here, for example,
is a leaf from a manuscript

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.336
that we imaged,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.240
which is perhaps the most valuable
Christian Bible in the world.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.656
The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest
translation of the Gospels into Latin,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.280
and it dates from the first half
of the fourth century.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.816
This is the closest we can come

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.776
to the Bible at the time
of the foundation of Christendom

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.416
under Emperor Constantine,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.976
and at the time also
of the Council of Nicaea,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.496
when the basic creed of Christianity
was being agreed upon.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.776
This manuscript, unfortunately,
has been very badly damaged,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.016
and it's damaged because for centuries

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.496
it had been used and handled

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.216
in swearing in ceremonies in the church.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.896
In fact, that purple splotch
that you see in the upper left hand corner

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.216
is Aspergillus, which is a fungus

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.776
which originates in the unwashed hands

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.800
of a person with tuberculosis.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.696
Our imaging has enabled me
to make the first transcription

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.320
of this manuscript in 250 years.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.256
Having a lab that can travel
to collections where it's needed, however,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.760
is only part of the solution.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.336
The technology is expensive and very rare,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.576
and the imaging and image
processing skills are esoteric.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.296
That means that mounting recoveries

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.216
is beyond the reach of most researchers
and all but the wealthiest institutions.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.016
That's why I founded the Lazarus Project,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.696
a not-for-profit initiative

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.696
to bring multispectral imaging
to individual researchers

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.560
and smaller institutions
at little or no cost whatsoever.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.176
Over the past five years,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.056
our team of imaging scientists,
scholars and students

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.256
has travelled to seven different countries

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.136
and have recovered some of the world's
most valuable damaged manuscripts,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
included the Vercelli Book,
which is the oldest book of English,

00:08:14.184 --> 00:08:16.800
the Black Book of Carmarthen,
the oldest book of Welsh,

00:08:16.824 --> 00:08:20.296
and some of the most valuable
earliest Gospels

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.200
located in what is now
the former Soviet Georgia.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.560
So, spectral imaging
can recover lost texts.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.456
More subtly, though, it can recover
a second story behind every object,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.176
the story of how, when
and by whom a text was created,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.600
and, sometimes, what the author
was thinking at the time he wrote.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.696
Take, for example, a draft
of the Declaration of Independence

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.136
written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.589
which some colleagues of mine
imaged a few years ago

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:51.933
at the Library of Congress.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.056
Curators had noticed
that one word throughout

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.456
had been scratched out and overwritten.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.560
The word overwritten was "citizens."

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.840
Perhaps you can guess
what the word underneath was.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.376
"Subjects."

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.216
There, ladies and gentlemen,
is American democracy

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.320
evolving under the hand
of Thomas Jefferson.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.216
Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.576
which we imaged
at Yale's Beinecke Library.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.056
This was the map
that Columbus likely consulted

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.776
before he traveled to the New World

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.536
and which gave him his idea
of what Asia looked like

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.160
and where Japan was located.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.656
The problem with this map
is that its inks and pigments

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.776
had so degraded over time

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.936
that this large, nearly seven-foot map,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.040
made the world look like a giant desert.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.136
Until now, we had very little idea,
detailed idea, that is,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.816
of what Columbus knew of the world

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.760
and how world cultures were represented.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.376
The main legend of the map
was entirely illegible under normal light.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.656
Ultraviolet did very little for it.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.680
Multispectral gave us everything.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.216
In Asia, we learned of monsters
with ears so long

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.560
that they could cover
the creature's entire body.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.440
In Africa, about a snake
who could cause the ground to smoke.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.936
Like starlight, which can convey images

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.536
of the way the Universe
looked in the distant past,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.456
so multispectral light can take us back
to the first stuttering moments

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.760
of an object's creation.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.416
Through this lens, we witness
the mistakes, the changes of mind,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.336
the naïvetés, the uncensored thoughts,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.576
the imperfections of the human imagination

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.416
that allow these hallowed objects
and their authors

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.096
to become more real,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.640
that make history closer to us.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.040
What about the future?

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.656
There's so much of the past,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.896
and so few people
with the skills to rescue it

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.800
before these objects disappear forever.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.776
That's why I have begun to teach
this new hybrid discipline

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.696
that I call "textual science."

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.336
Textual science is a marriage

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.736
of the traditional skills
of a literary scholar --

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.296
the ability to read old languages
and old handwriting,

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.016
the knowledge of how texts are made

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.176
in order to be able
to place and date them --

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.936
with new techniques like imaging science,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.536
the chemistry of inks and pigments,

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.960
computer-aided optical
character recognition.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.336
Last year, a student in my class,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.576
a freshman,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.416
with a background in Latin and Greek,

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.776
was image-processing a palimpsest

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.520
that we had photographed
at a famous library in Rome.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.000
As he worked, tiny Greek writing
began to appear from behind the text.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.696
Everyone gathered around,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.376
and he read a line from a lost work

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.720
of the Greek comic dramatist Menander.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.456
This was the first time
in well over a thousand years

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.040
that those words
had been pronounced aloud.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.440
In that moment, he became a scholar.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is the future of the past.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.056
Thank you very much.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.080
(Applause)
