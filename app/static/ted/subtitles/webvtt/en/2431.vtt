00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.056
I believe big institutions

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.696
have unique potential to create change,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.696
and I believe that we as individuals

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.016
have unique power

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.760
to influence the direction
that those institutions take.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.056
Now, these beliefs did not
come naturally to me,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.656
because trusting big institutions,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.480
not really part of my family legacy.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.736
My mother escaped North Korea

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.616
when she was 10 years old.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.656
To do so, she had to elude
every big institution in her life:

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.536
repressive governments, occupying armies

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.480
and even armed border patrols.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.416
Later, when she decided she wanted
to emigrate to the United States,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.496
she had to defy an entire culture

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.040
that said the girls would never
be the best and brightest.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.616
Only because her name
happens to sound like a boy's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.896
was she able to finagle her way
into the government immigration exam

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.520
to come to the United States.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.976
Because of her bravery and passion,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.856
I've had all the opportunities
that she never did,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.400
and that has made my story so different.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.456
Instead of running away
from big institutions,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.296
I've actually run toward them.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.576
I've had the chance
over the course of my career

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.416
to work for The Wall Street Journal,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.656
the White House

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.656
and now one of the largest
financial institutions in the world,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.816
where I lead sustainable investing.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.256
Now, these institutions are like tankers,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.696
and working inside of them,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.336
I've come to appreciate
what large wakes they can leave,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.656
and I've become convinced

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.416
that the institution
of the global capital markets,

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.336
the nearly 290 trillion dollars
of stocks and bonds in the world,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.216
that that may be one
of our most powerful forces

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.816
for positive social change
at our disposal,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.080
if we ask it to be.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.776
Now, I know some of you are thinking,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.296
global capital markets,
positive social change,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.136
not usually in the same sentence
or even the same paragraph.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.496
I think many people think
of the capital markets

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.816
kind of like an ocean.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.656
It's a vast, impersonal,
uncaring force of nature

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.336
that is not affected
by our wishes or desires.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.696
So the best that our
little savings accounts

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.416
or retirement accounts can do

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.016
is to try to catch some waves
in the good cycles

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.801
and hope that we don't get
inundated in the turbulent ones,

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:13.056
but certainly our decisions on how
to steer our little retirement accounts

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.576
don't affect the tides,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.000
don't change the shape or size
or direction of the waves.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.016
But why is that?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.376
Because actually,
one third of this ocean of capital

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.016
actually belongs to individuals like us,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.096
and most of the rest
of the capital markets

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.336
is controlled by the institutions
that get their power and authority

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.136
and their capital from us,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.296
as members, participants,
beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.160
So if we are the ultimate owners
of the capital markets,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.360
why aren't we able
to make our voices heard?

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.920
Why can't we make some waves?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.856
So let me ask you a different question:

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.096
did any of you buy fair trade coffee

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.776
the last time you were
at a supermarket or at Starbucks?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.216
OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.896
and order the sustainably farmed trout

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.456
instead of the miso-glazed
Chilean sea bass

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.200
that you really wish you could have?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.840
Do any of you drive hybrid cars
or even electric cars?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.536
So why do we do these things?

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.416
Right? One electric car doesn't amount
to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.920
combustion engine vehicles.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.440
One fish is just one fish in the sea.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.336
And one cup of coffee

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.920
doesn't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.936
But we do these things
because we believe they matter,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.216
that our actions add up,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.136
that our choices might influence others

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.320
and collectively,
what an impact we can have.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.856
So, in my bag I have a coffee mug
that I bought a couple of years ago.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.816
It's a reusable mug.
It has all these things printed on it.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.936
Look at some of the things
that are on it, that it says.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.496
"This one cup can be used
again and again."

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.376
"This one cup may inspire others
to use one too."

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.696
"This one cup helps save the planet."

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.176
I had no idea this plastic cup
was so powerful.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.296
(Laughter)

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.216
So why do we think that our choice

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.056
of a four dollar shade-grown
fair trade artisanal cup of coffee

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.256
in a reusable mug matters,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.042
but what we do with 4,000 dollars
in our investment account

00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:10.466
for our IRA doesn't?

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.896
Why can't we tell the supermarket
and the capital markets

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.336
that we care,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.616
that we care about fair labor standards,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.976
that we care about sustainable
production methods

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.856
and about healthy communities?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.896
Why aren't we voting
with our investment dollars,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.560
but we would vote with our lattes?

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.736
So I think it has something
to do with the myths,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.976
the fables that we all carry around
in our collective consciousness.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.576
Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale
about the magic porridge pot?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.976
If you said to the pot,
"Boil, little pot, boil,"

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.296
it would fill up with sweet porridge.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.416
And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop,"

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.640
it would stop.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.616
But if you got the words wrong,
it wouldn't listen,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.400
and things could go terribly awry.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.376
So I think when it comes to markets,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.896
we have a little bit
of a similar fable in our heads.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.256
We believe that the markets
is this magic pot

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.136
that obeys only one command:

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.200
make more money.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.816
Only those words said exactly that way

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.680
will make the pot fill up with gold.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.976
Add in some extra words
like "protect the environment,"

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.640
the spell might not work.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.160
Put in the wrong words
like "promote social justice,"

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.576
and you might see your gold coins shrink

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.440
or even vanish entirely,
according to this fable.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.216
So we asked people,
what do you really think?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.456
And we actually went out and polled
a thousand individual investors,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.496
and we found something fascinating.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.016
Overwhelmingly,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.656
people wanted to add
those extra words into the formula.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.736
71 percent of people said yes,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.336
they were interested
in sustainable investing,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.296
which we define as taking the best
in class investment process

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.056
that you already have traditionally

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.136
and adding in the extra
information you get

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.416
when you think about the environment
and society and good governance.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.176
71 percent wanted that.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.856
72 percent said that they believe
that companies who did that

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.696
would actually do better financially.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.376
So people really do believe
that you can do well by doing good.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.816
But here was the weird thing:

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.376
54 percent of the people

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.576
still said if they put their money
in those kinds of stocks,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.720
they thought that they
would make less money.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.496
So is it true?

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.296
Do you get less sweet porridge
if you invest in shade-grown coffee

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.560
instead of drinking it?

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.016
Well, you know, the investors
in companies like Burt's Bees

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.816
or Ben &amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.816
Right? Both of those started out
as small, socially conscious companies

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.976
that ended up becoming
so popular with consumers

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.056
that the giants Unilever
and Clorox bought them

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.240
for hundreds of millions of dollars

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.080
each.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.376
But here's the important thing.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.736
Those corporations realized

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.696
that if they wanted to protect
the value of their investments,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.216
they had to preserve
that socially conscious mission.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.456
If they didn't keep adding in
those extra words

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.896
of environmentally friendly
and socially conscious,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.000
those brands wouldn't make more money.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.776
But maybe this is just the exception
the proves the rule, right?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.336
The serious companies
that fund our economy

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.656
and that fund our retirements
and that really make the world go round,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.120
they need to stick to making more money.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.656
So, Harvard Business School
actually researched this,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.442
and they found something fascinating.

00:07:19.466 --> 00:07:22.096
If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.776
in a portfolio of companies

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.016
that focused narrowly on making more money

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.976
quarter by quarter,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.416
that one dollar

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.296
would have grown
to 14 dollars and 46 cents.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.576
That's not bad until you consider

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.616
that if instead
you'd invested that same dollar

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.296
in a portfolio of companies

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.130
that focused on growing their business

00:07:42.154 --> 00:07:45.394
and on the most important
environmental and social issues,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.216
that one dollar would have grown

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.680
to 28 dollars and 36 cents.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.136
almost twice as much sweet porridge.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.136
Now, let's be clear, they didn't make
that outperformance

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.056
by giving away money
to seem like a nice corporate citizen.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.296
They did it by focusing on the things
that matter to their business,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.736
like wasting less energy and water

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.536
in their manufacturing processes;

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.936
like making sure the CEO contracts
had the CEOs incentivized

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.416
for the long-term results of the company
and the communities they served,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.816
not just quarterly results;

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.136
or building a first class culture

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.496
that would have higher employee loyalty,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.480
retention and productivity.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.736
Now, Harvard's not alone.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.776
Oxford also did a research study
where they examined 120 different studies

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.256
looking at the effect
of sustainability and economic results,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.056
and they found
time and time and time again

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.936
that the companies that cared
about these kinds of important things

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.000
actually had better
operational efficiency,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.416
lower cost of capital

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.680
and better performance
in their stock price.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.856
And then there's Al Gore.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.816
So 20 years ago, when I worked
for Al Gore in the White House,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.296
he was one of the early pioneers
pleading with businesses and governments

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.016
to pay attention to the challenges
of climate change.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.088
Post-White House, he opened
an investment firm called Generation,

00:09:01.112 --> 00:09:04.376
where he baked environmental
sustainability and other things

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.280
right into the core investment process.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.496
And at the time there was
a good bit of skepticism about his views.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.256
Ten years later, his track record
is one more proof point

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.976
that sustainable investing done right
can be sound investing.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.856
Far from making less sweet porridge

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.256
because he added
sustainability into the mix,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.960
he actually significantly
outperformed the benchmark.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.096
Now, sustainable investing,

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.000
the good news is
it doesn't require a magic spell

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.096
and it doesn't require
some investment secret,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.696
and it's not just for the elite.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.216
It is not just about private equity
for billionaires.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.193
It's not just groovy-sounding investments
like clean technology

00:09:42.217 --> 00:09:43.913
or microfinance in emerging markets

00:09:43.937 --> 00:09:46.160
or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.016
It's about stocks and bonds
and Fortune 500 companies.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.256
It's about mutual funds.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.736
It's about all the things

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.920
we already see in the market today.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.496
So here's why I'm convinced

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.656
that we collectively have the power

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.760
to make sustainable investing
the new normal.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.776
First, the proof points
are coming out all the time

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.816
that sustainable investing done right,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.056
preserving all the same
good principles of investing,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.040
the traditional sphere, can pay.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.336
It makes sense.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.776
Secondly,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.936
the biggest obstacle standing in our way

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.000
may actually just be in our heads.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.576
We just need to let go of that myth

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.856
that if you add your values
into your investment thinking,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.496
that you get less sweet porridge.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.176
And once you get rid of the fable,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.656
you can actually start appreciating
those facts we've been talking about.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.656
And third, the future is already here.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.656
Sustainable investment today
is a 20 trillion dollar market

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.056
and it's the fastest-growing segment
of the investment industry.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.296
In the United States,
it has grown enormously, as you can see.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.016
It now represents
one out of every six dollars

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.440
under professional management
in the United States.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.720
So what are we waiting for?

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.494
For me, it goes back to the inspiration
that I received from my mother.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.776
She knew that she wanted a life

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.440
where she would have the freedom
to make her own choices

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.496
and to have her voice heard
and write her own story.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.976
She was passionate about that goal

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.616
and she was clear that she would let
no army, no obstacle,

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.160
no big institution stand in her way.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.896
She made it to the States,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.656
and she became a teacher,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.376
an award-winning author

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.656
and a mother,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.376
and ended up sending
her daughters to Harvard.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.496
And these days, you can tell
that she is amply comfortable

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.576
holding court in the most powerful
institutions in the world.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.496
It seems almost too prophetic

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.816
that her name in Korean means

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.120
"passionate clarity."

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.936
Passionate clarity:

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.736
that's what I think we need
to drive change.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.096
Passion about the change
we want to see in the world,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.760
and clarity that we are able
to help chart the course.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.496
We have more opportunity today
than ever before

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.760
to make choices.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.040
We have more power than ever before
to make our voices heard.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.120
So change your perspective.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.936
Vote with your small change.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.840
Invest in the change
you want to see in the world.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.576
Change the fables

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.840
and change the markets.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.496
Thank you.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.320
(Applause)
