00:00:01.157 --> 00:00:02.421
Food crisis.

00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:04.023
It's in the news every day.

00:00:04.047 --> 00:00:05.369
But what is it?

00:00:05.393 --> 00:00:08.292
Some places in the world
it's too little food,

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:09.506
maybe too much.

00:00:09.963 --> 00:00:12.292
Other places, GMO is saving the world.

00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:14.609
Maybe GMO is the problem?

00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:18.817
Too much agricultural runoff
creating bad oceans, toxic oceans,

00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:20.478
attenuation of nutrition.

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:22.502
They go on and on.

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.144
And I find the current climate
of this discussion

00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:28.467
incredibly disempowering.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.551
So how do we bring that
to something that we understand?

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:35.738
How is this apple food crisis?

00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:38.809
You've all eaten an apple
in the last week, I'm sure.

00:00:39.468 --> 00:00:42.221
How old do you think it was
from when it was picked?

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:44.448
Two weeks?

00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:45.626
Two months?

00:00:46.887 --> 00:00:48.040
Eleven months --

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:51.419
the average age of an apple
in a grocery store in the United States.

00:00:51.443 --> 00:00:53.942
And I don't expect it
to be much different in Europe

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.446
or anywhere else in the world.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.634
We pick them,

00:00:56.658 --> 00:00:58.735
we put them in cold storage,

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.027
we gas the cold storage --

00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:01.948
there's actually documented proof

00:01:01.972 --> 00:01:04.215
of workers trying to go
into these environments

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.833
to retrieve an apple,

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:07.025
and dying,

00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:08.761
because the atmosphere

00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:12.750
that they slow down the process
of the apple with is also toxic to humans.

00:01:13.152 --> 00:01:15.051
How is it that none of you knew this?

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.579
Why didn't I know this?

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:19.294
Ninety percent of the quality
of that apple --

00:01:19.318 --> 00:01:22.278
all of the antioxidants -- are gone
by the time we get it.

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.902
It's basically a little ball of sugar.

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:28.908
How did we get so information poor

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:30.390
and how can we do better?

00:01:31.347 --> 00:01:34.203
I think what's missing is a platform.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.439
I know platforms -- I know computers,

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.582
they put me on the Internet
when I was young.

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:39.852
I did very weird things --

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:40.877
(Laughter)

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.052
on this platform.

00:01:42.076 --> 00:01:44.169
But I met people,
and I could express myself.

00:01:44.193 --> 00:01:46.207
How do you express yourself in food?

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:48.096
If we had a platform,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.267
we might feel empowered
to question: What if?

00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:53.156
For me, I questioned:

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.926
What if climate was democratic?

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.837
So, this is a map of climate in the world.

00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:03.201
The most productive areas in green,
the least productive in red.

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:04.914
They shift and they change,

00:02:04.938 --> 00:02:07.609
and Californian farmers
now become Mexican farmers.

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:10.831
China picks up land in Brazil
to grow better food,

00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:12.881
and we're a slave to climate.

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:17.113
What if each country had
its own productive climate?

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:19.732
What would that change about how we live?

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:23.217
What would that change
about quality of life and nutrition?

00:02:24.257 --> 00:02:27.552
The last generation's problem
was, we need more food

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:28.757
and we need it cheap.

00:02:29.194 --> 00:02:31.314
Welcome to your global farm.

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:33.798
We built a huge analog farm.

00:02:33.822 --> 00:02:35.252
All these traces --

00:02:35.276 --> 00:02:38.176
these are cars, planes,
trains and automobiles.

00:02:38.597 --> 00:02:41.782
It's a miracle that we feed
seven billion people

00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:44.851
with just a few of us involved
in the production of food.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:46.877
What if ...

00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:49.434
we built a digital farm?

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:50.621
A digital world farm.

00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:53.454
What if you could take this apple,

00:02:54.052 --> 00:02:55.762
digitize it somehow,

00:02:55.786 --> 00:02:58.254
send it through particles in the air

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.688
and reconstitute it on the other side?

00:03:01.337 --> 00:03:02.497
What if?

00:03:03.338 --> 00:03:05.013
Going through some of these quotes,

00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:07.079
you know, they inspire me to do what I do.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.258
First one:

00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:12.392
["Japanese farming has no youth,
no water, no land and no future."]

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:16.505
That's what I landed to the day
that I went to Minamisanriku,

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.102
one stop south of Fukushima,

00:03:18.126 --> 00:03:19.828
after the disaster.

00:03:19.852 --> 00:03:22.403
The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo,

00:03:22.427 --> 00:03:23.802
the land is contaminated,

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:26.147
they already import 70 percent
of their own food.

00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:28.311
But it's not unique to Japan.

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:32.146
Two percent of the American population
is involved in farming.

00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:36.633
What good answer comes
from two percent of any population?

00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:39.310
As we go around the world,

00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:42.945
50 percent of the African
population is under 18.

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.721
Eighty percent don't want to be farmers.

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:48.199
Farming is hard.

00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:52.482
The life of a small-shareholder
farmer is miserable.

00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:54.673
They go into the city.

00:03:54.697 --> 00:03:55.857
In India:

00:03:56.523 --> 00:03:59.713
farmers' families not being able
to have basic access to utilities,

00:03:59.737 --> 00:04:03.536
more farmer suicides this year
and the previous 10 before that.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.195
It's uncomfortable to talk about.

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.387
Where are they going?

00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:07.619
Into the city.

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.887
No young people, and everyone's headed in.

00:04:10.911 --> 00:04:14.882
So how do we build this platform
that inspires the youth?

00:04:15.687 --> 00:04:17.319
Welcome to the new tractor.

00:04:17.754 --> 00:04:19.581
This is my combine.

00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:21.523
A number of years ago now,

00:04:21.547 --> 00:04:23.709
I went to Bed Bath and Beyond
and Home Depot

00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:24.884
and I started hacking.

00:04:24.908 --> 00:04:26.123
And I built silly things

00:04:26.147 --> 00:04:27.298
and I made plants dance

00:04:27.322 --> 00:04:29.173
and I attached them to my computer

00:04:29.197 --> 00:04:30.487
and I killed them all --

00:04:30.966 --> 00:04:32.139
a lot.

00:04:32.163 --> 00:04:33.163
(Laughter)

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.383
I eventually got them to survive.

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:37.873
And I created one of the most
intimate relationships

00:04:37.897 --> 00:04:39.112
I've ever had in my life,

00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:42.241
because I was learning
the language of plants.

00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:44.326
I wanted to make it bigger.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.113
They said, "Knock yourself out, kid!

00:04:46.137 --> 00:04:49.038
Here's an old electronics room
that nobody wants.

00:04:49.062 --> 00:04:50.364
What can you do?"

00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:53.658
With my team, we built a farm
inside of the media lab,

00:04:53.682 --> 00:04:57.616
a place historically known
not for anything about biology

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.189
but everything about digital life.

00:05:00.213 --> 00:05:02.855
Inside of these 60 square feet,

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.005
we produced enough food to feed
about 300 people once a month --

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.181
not a lot of food.

00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:09.720
And there's a lot of interesting
technology in there.

00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:11.399
But the most interesting thing?

00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:13.931
Beautiful, white roots,

00:05:14.478 --> 00:05:16.899
deep, green colors

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.161
and a monthly harvest.

00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:22.229
Is this a new cafeteria?

00:05:22.787 --> 00:05:26.108
Is this a new retail experience?

00:05:26.132 --> 00:05:27.706
Is this a new grocery store?

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.611
I can tell you one thing for sure:

00:05:30.127 --> 00:05:31.277
this is the first time

00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:34.182
anybody in the media lab
ripped the roots off of anything.

00:05:34.613 --> 00:05:36.030
(Laughter)

00:05:36.528 --> 00:05:38.233
We get our salad in bags;

00:05:38.257 --> 00:05:39.993
there's nothing wrong with that.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.921
But what happens

00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:45.056
when you have an image-based
processing expert,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.495
a data scientist,

00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:48.392
a roboticist,

00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:50.459
ripping roots off and thinking,

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:52.363
"Huh. I know something about --

00:05:52.387 --> 00:05:54.580
I could make this happen, I want to try."

00:05:55.364 --> 00:05:57.639
In that process we would
bring the plants out

00:05:57.663 --> 00:05:59.572
and we would take some back to the lab,

00:05:59.596 --> 00:06:01.852
because if you grew it,
you don't throw it away;

00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:03.273
it's kind of precious to you.

00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:04.694
I have this weird tongue now,

00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:08.162
because I'm afraid to let anybody eat
anything until I've eaten it first,

00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:09.575
because I want it to be good.

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:10.845
So I eat lettuce every day

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:13.326
and I can tell the pH
of a lettuce within .1.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.355
(Laughter)

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.550
I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no,
no, you can't eat it today."

00:06:17.574 --> 00:06:20.719
(Applause)

00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:24.630
This lettuce that day was hyper sweet.

00:06:25.362 --> 00:06:27.910
It was hyper sweet
because the plant had been stressed

00:06:27.934 --> 00:06:31.063
and it created a chemical reaction
in the plant to protect itself:

00:06:31.087 --> 00:06:32.251
"I'm not going to die!"

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:35.404
And the plants not-going-to-die,
taste sweet to me.

00:06:36.683 --> 00:06:39.545
Technologists falling backwards
into plant physiology.

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.274
So we thought other people
needed to be able to try this.

00:06:42.298 --> 00:06:44.155
We want to see what people can create,

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:46.868
so we conceived of a lab
that could be shipped anywhere.

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:48.591
And then we built it.

00:06:50.095 --> 00:06:52.718
So on the facade
of the media lab is my lab,

00:06:52.742 --> 00:06:55.435
that has about 30 points
of sensing per plant.

00:06:56.035 --> 00:06:59.204
If you know about the genome or genetics,

00:06:59.228 --> 00:07:01.731
this is the phenome, right?

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:02.997
The phenomena.

00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:05.501
When you say, "I like
the strawberries from Mexico,"

00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:07.914
you really like the strawberries
from the climate

00:07:07.938 --> 00:07:10.026
that produced the expression
that you like.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.239
So if you're coding climate --

00:07:12.263 --> 00:07:15.564
this much CO2, this much O2 creates
a recipe -- you're coding

00:07:15.588 --> 00:07:18.863
the expression of that plant,
the nutrition of that plant,

00:07:18.887 --> 00:07:22.145
the size of that plant, the shape,
the color, the texture.

00:07:23.683 --> 00:07:24.868
We need data,

00:07:24.892 --> 00:07:26.673
so we put a bunch of sensors in there

00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:28.000
to tell us what's going on.

00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:29.606
If you think of your houseplants,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.125
and you look at your houseplant

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:33.161
and you're super sad, because you're like,

00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:35.201
"Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?"

00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:36.225
(Laughter)

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:39.481
Farmers develop the most beautiful
fortune-telling eyes

00:07:39.505 --> 00:07:41.676
by the time they're in their
late 60s and 70s.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.893
They can tell you when you
see that plant dying

00:07:43.917 --> 00:07:46.456
that it's a nitrogen deficiency,
a calcium deficiency

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.884
or it needs more humidity.

00:07:47.908 --> 00:07:50.223
Those beautiful eyes
are not being passed down.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.517
These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.295
We trend those data points over time.

00:07:56.805 --> 00:07:59.280
We correlate those data points
to individual plants.

00:07:59.304 --> 00:08:03.354
These are all the broccoli
in my lab that day, by IP address.

00:08:03.378 --> 00:08:04.516
(Laughter)

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.261
We have IP-addressable broccoli.

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:12.690
(Applause)

00:08:12.714 --> 00:08:15.389
So if that's not weird enough,

00:08:15.413 --> 00:08:17.902
you can click one
and you get a plant profile.

00:08:17.926 --> 00:08:20.942
And what this tells you
is downloadable progress on that plant,

00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:22.172
but not like you'd think,

00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:23.641
it's not just when it's ready.

00:08:23.665 --> 00:08:25.941
When does it achieve
the nutrition that I need?

00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:28.745
When does it achieve
the taste that I desire?

00:08:29.284 --> 00:08:30.960
Is it getting too much water?

00:08:30.984 --> 00:08:32.896
Is it getting too much sun?

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.084
Alerts.

00:08:34.108 --> 00:08:35.942
It can talk to me, it's conversant,

00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:37.330
we have a language.

00:08:38.043 --> 00:08:39.831
(Laughter)

00:08:39.855 --> 00:08:44.491
(Applause)

00:08:44.515 --> 00:08:49.294
I think of that as the first user
on the plant Facebook, right?

00:08:49.318 --> 00:08:50.524
That's a plant profile

00:08:50.548 --> 00:08:52.541
and that plant will start making friends.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:53.572
(Laughter)

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:56.215
And I mean it -- it will make
friends with other plants

00:08:56.239 --> 00:08:58.366
that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.588
less potassium.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.891
We're going to learn about a complexity

00:09:01.915 --> 00:09:03.532
that we can only guess at now.

00:09:04.048 --> 00:09:07.628
And they may not friend us back --
I don't know, they might friend us back,

00:09:07.652 --> 00:09:08.851
it depends on how we act.

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:10.833
So this is my lab now.

00:09:11.294 --> 00:09:13.032
It's a little bit more systematized,

00:09:13.056 --> 00:09:16.287
my background is designing data centers
in hospitals of all things,

00:09:16.311 --> 00:09:19.279
so I know a little bit about creating
a controlled environment.

00:09:19.303 --> 00:09:20.453
And so --

00:09:20.754 --> 00:09:22.397
inside of this environment,

00:09:22.421 --> 00:09:24.794
we're experimenting
with all kinds of things.

00:09:24.818 --> 00:09:29.026
This process, aeroponics, was developed
by NASA for Mir Space Station

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.598
for reducing the amount of water
they send into space.

00:09:31.622 --> 00:09:34.481
What it really does is give the plant
exactly what it wants:

00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:36.140
water, minerals and oxygen.

00:09:36.164 --> 00:09:37.656
Roots are not that complicated,

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.592
so when you give them that,
you get this amazing expression.

00:09:42.472 --> 00:09:45.545
It's like the plant has two hearts.

00:09:45.569 --> 00:09:47.234
And because it has two hearts,

00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.027
it grows four or five times faster.

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:51.811
It's a perfect world.

00:09:51.835 --> 00:09:55.048
We've gone a long way into technology
and seed for an adverse world

00:09:55.072 --> 00:09:56.937
and we're going to continue to do that,

00:09:56.961 --> 00:09:58.874
but we're going to have a new tool, too,

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.581
which is perfect world.

00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:02.284
So we've grown all kinds of things.

00:10:02.308 --> 00:10:06.116
These tomatoes hadn't been
in commercial production for 150 years.

00:10:06.515 --> 00:10:09.789
Do you know that we have
rare and ancient seed banks?

00:10:10.312 --> 00:10:12.054
Banks of seed.

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:13.235
It's amazing.

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:16.141
They have germplasm alive
and things that you've never eaten.

00:10:16.165 --> 00:10:19.446
I am the only person in this room
that's eaten that kind of tomato.

00:10:19.837 --> 00:10:22.838
Problem is it was a sauce tomato
and we don't know how to cook,

00:10:22.862 --> 00:10:25.218
so we ate a sauce tomato,
which is not that great.

00:10:25.242 --> 00:10:28.558
But we've done things with protein --
we've grown all kinds of things.

00:10:28.582 --> 00:10:29.755
We've grown humans --

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:31.421
(Laughter)

00:10:32.103 --> 00:10:33.835
Well maybe you could, but we didn't.

00:10:33.859 --> 00:10:35.455
But what we realized is,

00:10:35.479 --> 00:10:37.554
the tool was too big,
it was too expensive.

00:10:37.578 --> 00:10:39.582
I was starting to put them
around the world

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:41.423
and they were about 100,000 dollars.

00:10:41.447 --> 00:10:44.456
Finding somebody with 100 grand
in their back pocket isn't easy,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.060
so we wanted to make a small one.

00:10:46.084 --> 00:10:48.381
This project was actually
one of my student's --

00:10:48.405 --> 00:10:51.261
mechanical engineering
undergraduate, Camille.

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.383
So Camille and I and my team,

00:10:53.407 --> 00:10:55.265
we iterated all summer,

00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:57.709
how to make it cheaper,
how to make it work better,

00:10:57.733 --> 00:10:59.757
how to make it so other
people can make it.

00:10:59.781 --> 00:11:03.084
Then we dropped them off in schools,
seventh through eleventh grade.

00:11:03.108 --> 00:11:06.107
And if you want to be humbled,
try to teach a kid something.

00:11:06.131 --> 00:11:07.980
So I went into this school and I said,

00:11:08.004 --> 00:11:09.897
"Set it to 65 percent humidity."

00:11:09.921 --> 00:11:12.187
The seventh grader
said, "What's humidity?"

00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:14.076
And I said, "Oh, it's water in air."

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.544
He said, "There's no water
in air, you're an idiot."

00:11:16.568 --> 00:11:17.587
(Laughter)

00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:19.620
And I was like, "Alright, don't trust me.

00:11:19.644 --> 00:11:21.303
Actually -- don't trust me, right?

00:11:21.327 --> 00:11:22.478
Set it to 100.

00:11:22.502 --> 00:11:24.207
He sets it to 100 and what happens?

00:11:24.231 --> 00:11:27.005
It starts to condense, make a fog
and eventually drip.

00:11:27.457 --> 00:11:30.681
And he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain.

00:11:31.372 --> 00:11:33.002
Why didn't you just tell me that?"

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.996
(Laughter)

00:11:35.489 --> 00:11:38.332
We've created an interface
for this that's much like a game.

00:11:38.356 --> 00:11:39.672
They have a 3D environment,

00:11:39.696 --> 00:11:41.712
they can log into it anywhere in the world

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:43.519
on their smartphone, on their tablet.

00:11:43.543 --> 00:11:46.970
They have different parts of the bots --
the physical, the sensors.

00:11:46.994 --> 00:11:49.634
They select recipes that have
been created by other kids

00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:50.808
anywhere in the world.

00:11:50.832 --> 00:11:53.863
They select and activate that recipe,
they plant a seedling.

00:11:54.324 --> 00:11:56.161
While it's growing, they make changes.

00:11:56.185 --> 00:11:59.194
They're like, "Why does a plant
need CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad?

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:00.369
It kills people."

00:12:00.393 --> 00:12:01.764
Crank up CO2, plant dies.

00:12:02.404 --> 00:12:05.401
Or crank down CO2, plant does very well.

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:06.615
Harvest plant,

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.297
and you've created a new digital recipe.

00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:11.911
It's an iterative design and development

00:12:11.935 --> 00:12:13.847
and exploration process.

00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:15.283
They can download, then,

00:12:15.307 --> 00:12:18.024
all of the data about that new plant
that they developed

00:12:18.048 --> 00:12:20.334
or the new digital recipe
and what did it do --

00:12:20.358 --> 00:12:21.802
was it better or was it worse?

00:12:21.826 --> 00:12:23.952
Imagine these as little cores
of processing.

00:12:24.771 --> 00:12:26.738
We're going to learn so much.

00:12:27.764 --> 00:12:30.462
Here's one of the food computers,
as we call them,

00:12:30.486 --> 00:12:32.738
in a school in three weeks' time.

00:12:33.793 --> 00:12:35.232
This is three weeks of growth.

00:12:35.256 --> 00:12:37.100
But more importantly,

00:12:37.124 --> 00:12:41.084
it was the first time that this kid
ever thought he could be a farmer --

00:12:41.658 --> 00:12:43.774
or that he would want to be a farmer.

00:12:44.187 --> 00:12:46.202
So, we've open-sourced all of this.

00:12:46.226 --> 00:12:49.312
It's all online; go home, try to build
your first food computer.

00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:51.725
It's going to be difficult --
I'm just telling you.

00:12:51.749 --> 00:12:53.813
We're in the beginning,
but it's all there.

00:12:53.837 --> 00:12:56.536
It's very important to me
that this is easily accessible.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.407
We're going to keep making it more so.

00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:00.374
These are farmers,

00:13:01.016 --> 00:13:02.993
electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,

00:13:03.017 --> 00:13:05.050
environmental engineer,
computer scientist,

00:13:05.074 --> 00:13:07.668
plant scientist,
economist, urban planners.

00:13:08.214 --> 00:13:10.968
On one platform, doing
what they're good at.

00:13:10.992 --> 00:13:12.816
But we got a little too big.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.672
This is my new facility
that I'm just starting.

00:13:15.696 --> 00:13:17.536
This warehouse could be anywhere.

00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:19.353
That's why I chose it.

00:13:19.718 --> 00:13:21.341
And inside of this warehouse

00:13:21.365 --> 00:13:23.734
we're going to build something
kind of like this.

00:13:23.758 --> 00:13:25.220
These exist right now.

00:13:25.244 --> 00:13:26.471
Take a look at it.

00:13:28.053 --> 00:13:29.384
These exist, too.

00:13:30.034 --> 00:13:31.314
One grows greens,

00:13:31.338 --> 00:13:32.919
one grows Ebola vaccine.

00:13:34.212 --> 00:13:38.126
Pretty amazing that plants
and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.646
is one of the reasons
we're getting ahead of Ebola.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.654
The plants are producing
the protein that's Ebola resistant.

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:47.621
So pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals,

00:13:47.645 --> 00:13:49.161
all they way down to lettuce.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.558
But these two things look nothing alike,

00:13:51.582 --> 00:13:53.859
and that's where I am with my field.

00:13:53.883 --> 00:13:55.272
Everything is different.

00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:58.939
We're in that weird "We're alright" stage

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.826
and it's like, "Here's my black box --"

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.001
"No, buy mine."

00:14:02.025 --> 00:14:05.386
"No, no, no -- I've got intellectual
property that's totally valuable.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.610
Don't buy his, buy mine."

00:14:06.634 --> 00:14:08.919
And the reality is,
we're just at the beginning,

00:14:08.943 --> 00:14:11.086
in a time when society is shifting, too.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.825
When we ask for more, cheaper food,

00:14:12.849 --> 00:14:16.189
we're now asking for better,
environmentally friendly food.

00:14:16.654 --> 00:14:21.967
And when you have McDonald's advertising
what's in the Chicken McNugget,

00:14:21.991 --> 00:14:24.086
the most mysterious
food item of all time --

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.847
they are now basing
their marketing plan on that --

00:14:26.871 --> 00:14:28.341
everything is changing.

00:14:28.365 --> 00:14:29.887
So into the world now.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.569
Personal food computers,

00:14:32.764 --> 00:14:33.914
food servers

00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:36.672
and food data centers

00:14:38.434 --> 00:14:40.853
run on the open phenome.

00:14:41.245 --> 00:14:44.474
Think open genome, but we're going
to put little climate recipes,

00:14:44.498 --> 00:14:45.659
like Wikipedia,

00:14:45.683 --> 00:14:49.164
that you can pull down, actuate and grow.

00:14:51.275 --> 00:14:53.005
What does this look like in a world?

00:14:53.029 --> 00:14:55.164
You remember the world
connected by strings?

00:14:55.188 --> 00:14:56.735
We start having beacons.

00:14:57.338 --> 00:14:59.424
We start sending information about food,

00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:00.767
rather than sending food.

00:15:01.249 --> 00:15:02.967
This is not just my fantasy,

00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:05.029
this is where we're already deploying.

00:15:05.578 --> 00:15:07.267
Food computers, food servers,

00:15:07.291 --> 00:15:08.727
soon-to-be food data centers,

00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:11.165
connecting people together
to share information.

00:15:12.723 --> 00:15:18.080
The future of food is not about fighting
over what's wrong with this.

00:15:18.556 --> 00:15:20.382
We know what's wrong with this.

00:15:21.128 --> 00:15:25.643
The future of food is about networking
the next one billion farmers

00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.941
and empowering them with a platform

00:15:27.965 --> 00:15:29.985
to ask and answer the question,

00:15:30.693 --> 00:15:32.028
"What if?"

00:15:32.052 --> 00:15:33.223
Thank you.

00:15:33.247 --> 00:15:42.080
(Applause)
