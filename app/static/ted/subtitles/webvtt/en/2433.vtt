WEBVTT

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.520
There are a few things
that all of us need.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.680
We all need air to breathe.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.696
We need clean water to drink.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.736
We need food to eat.
We need shelter and love.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.920
You know. Love is great, too.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.856
And we all need a safe place to pee.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.656
(Laughter) Yeah?

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.616
As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly
into the gender binary,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.120
if I could change the world tomorrow

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.056
to make it easier for me to navigate,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.296
the very first thing I would do

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.256
is blink and create single stall,
gender-neutral bathrooms

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.936
in all public places.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.720
(Applause)

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.656
Trans people and trans issues,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.616
they've been getting a lot
of mainstream media attention lately.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.376
And this is a great and necessary thing,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.856
but most of that attention
has been focused

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.296
on a very few individuals,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.160
most of whom are kinda rich

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.376
and pretty famous,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.336
and probably don't have to worry that much
anymore about where they're going to pee

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.536
in between classes
at their community college,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.296
or where they're going to get changed
into their gym strip

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.696
at their public high school.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.376
Fame and money insulates
these television star trans people

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.256
from most of the everyday challenges

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.560
that the rest of us
have to tackle on a daily basis.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.680
Public bathrooms.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.080
They've been a problem for me
since as far back as I can remember,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.416
first when I was just a little baby tomboy

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.136
and then later as a masculine-appearing,
predominantly estrogen-based organism.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.216
(Laughter)

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.136
Now, today as a trans person,
public bathrooms and change rooms

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.520
are where I am most likely
to be questioned or harassed.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.576
I've often been verbally
attacked behind their doors.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.336
I've been hauled out by security guards
with my pants still halfway pulled up.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.736
I've been stared at,
screamed at, whispered about,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.496
and one time I got smacked in the face
by a little old lady's purse

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.096
that from the looks of the shiner
I took home that day

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.896
I am pretty certain contained at least
70 dollars of rolled up small change

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.896
and a large hard candy collection.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.560
(Laughter)

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.960
And I know what some of you are thinking,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.320
and you're mostly right.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.640
I can and do just use the men's room
most of the time these days.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.840
But that doesn't solve
my change room dilemmas, does it?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.840
And I shouldn't have to use the men's room
because I'm not a man.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.400
I'm a trans person.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.056
And now we've got
these fearmongering politicians

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.256
that keep trying to pass
these bathroom bills.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.616
Have you heard about these?

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.416
They try to legislate
to try and force people like myself

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.136
to use the bathroom
that they deem most appropriate

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.696
according to the gender
I was assigned at birth.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.216
And if these politicians
ever get their way,

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.736
in Arizona or California or Florida

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.136
or just last week in Houston, Texas,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.360
or Ottawa,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.680
well then, using the men's room
will not be a legal option for me either.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.595
And every time one of these politicians
brings one of these bills to the table,

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.656
I can't help but wonder, you know,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.216
just who will and exactly how would we
go about enforcing laws like these. Right?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.896
Panty checks?

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.576
Really.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.520
Genital inspections outside
of bath change rooms at public pools?

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.176
There's no legal
or ethical or plausible way

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.920
to enforce laws like these anyway.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.136
They exist only to foster fear

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.440
and promote transphobia.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.360
They don't make anyone safer.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.920
But they do for sure make the world
more dangerous for some of us.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.856
And meanwhile, our trans children suffer.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.416
They drop out of school,
or they opt out of life altogether.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.376
Trans people, especially trans
and gender-nonconforming youth

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.856
face additional challenges
when accessing pools and gyms,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.576
but also universities,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.360
hospitals, libraries.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.240
Don't even get me started
on how they treat us in airports.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.680
If we don't move now

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.416
to make sure that these places

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.496
are truly open and accessible to everyone,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.800
then we just need to get honest

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.160
and quit calling them public places.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.520
We need to just admit

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.496
that they are really only open for people

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.640
who fit neatly
into one of two gender boxes,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.800
which I do not.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.000
I never have.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.280
And this starts very early.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.560
I know a little girl.
She's the daughter of a friend of mine.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.816
She's a self-identified tomboy.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.936
I'm talking about cowboy boots

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.736
and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks
and bug jars, the whole nine yards.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.216
One time I asked her
what her favorite color was.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.536
She told me, "Camouflage."

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.920
(Laughter)

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.816
So that awesome little kid,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.656
she came home from school last October

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.936
from her half day of preschool

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.016
with soggy pants on because the other kids
at school were harassing her

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.440
when she tried to use the girls' bathroom.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.296
And the teacher had already instructed her
to stay out of the boys' bathroom.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.856
And she had drank two glasses
of that red juice

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.336
at the Halloween party,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.800
and I mean, who can resist
that red juice, right? It's so good.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.000
And she couldn't hold her pee any longer.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.000
Her and her classmates
were four years old.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.696
They already felt empowered enough

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.920
to police her use
of the so-called public bathrooms.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.736
She was four years old.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.856
She had already been taught
the brutal lesson

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.216
that there was
no bathroom door at preschool

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.440
with a sign on it
that welcomed people like her.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.640
She'd already learned that bathrooms
were going to be a problem,

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.640
and that problem started with her

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.040
and was hers alone.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.720
So my friend asked me
to talk to her little daughter,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.760
and I did.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.200
I wanted to tell her

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.266
that me and her mom
were going to march on down

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.216
and talk to that school,
and the problem was going to go away,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.616
but I knew that wasn't true.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.456
I wanted to tell her that it was all
going to get better when she got older,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.680
but I couldn't.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.920
So I asked her to tell me
the story of what had happened,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.360
asked her to tell me how it made her feel.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.920
"Mad and sad,"

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.960
she told me.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.120
So I told her

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.240
that she wasn't alone

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.376
and that it wasn't right
what had happened to her,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.016
and then she asked me
if I had ever peed in my pants before.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.040
I said yes, I had,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.416
but not for a really long time.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.656
(Laughter)

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.016
Which of course was a lie,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.776
because you know
how you hit, like, 42 or 43,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.776
and sometimes you just,
I don't know, you pee a little bit

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.056
when you cough or sneeze,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.256
when you're running upstairs,
or you're stretching.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.816
Don't lie.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.576
It happens. Right?

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.776
She doesn't need to know that, I figure.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.696
(Laughter)

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.280
I told her, when you get older,
your bladder is going to grow bigger, too.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.416
When you get old like me,

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.376
you're going to be able
to hold your pee for way longer,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.600
I promised her.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.800
"Until you can get home?"

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.400
she asked me.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.960
I said, "Yes,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.679
until you can get home."

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.840
She seemed to take some comfort in that.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.576
So let's just build some single stall,
gender-neutral bathrooms

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.280
with a little bench for getting changed
into your gym clothes.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.440
We can't change the world overnight

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.616
for our children,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.096
but we can give them
a safe and private place

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.576
to escape that world,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.800
if only for just a minute.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.640
This we can do.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.800
So let's just do it.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.136
And if you are one of those people
who is sitting out there right now

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.176
already coming up with a list of reasons
in your head why this is not a priority,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.336
or it's too expensive,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.976
or telling yourself that giving
a trans person a safe place to pee

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.656
or get changed in

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:36.576
supports a lifestyle choice
that you feel offends your morality,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.200
or your masculinity,

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.256
or your religious beliefs,

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.536
then let me just appeal

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.976
to the part of your heart
that probably, hopefully,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.680
does care about
the rest of the population.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.800
If you can't bring yourself
to care enough about people like me,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.216
then what about women and girls

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.776
with body image issues?

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.400
What about anyone
with body image stuff going on?

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.976
What about that boy at school
who is a foot shorter than his classmates,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.856
whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey?

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.816
Oh, grade eight,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.016
what a cruel master you can be.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.240
Right?

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.000
What about people with anxiety issues?

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.536
What about people with disabilities
or who need assistance in there?

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.056
What about folks with bodies
who, for whatever reason,

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.496
don't fit into the mainstream idea
of what a body should look like?

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.616
How many of us still feel shy

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.176
or afraid to disrobe
in front of our peers,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.776
and how many of us allow that fear

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.056
to keep us from something as important

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.200
as physical exercise?

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.640
Would all those people not benefit

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.680
from these single stall facilities?

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.960
We can't change
transphobic minds overnight,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.216
but we can give everybody

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.360
a place to get changed in

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.080
so that we can all get to work

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.480
