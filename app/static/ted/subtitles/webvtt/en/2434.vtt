00:00:00.844 --> 00:00:03.437
As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:06.920
It was this wild place
full of color and life,

00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:11.032
home to these alien-looking,
fantastical creatures.

00:00:11.056 --> 00:00:13.474
I pictured big sharks
ruling the food chain

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.702
and saw graceful sea turtles
dancing across coral reefs.

00:00:16.726 --> 00:00:18.741
As a marine biologist turned photographer,

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:21.585
I've spent most of my career
looking for places

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.839
as magical as those I used
to dream about when I was little.

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:26.630
As you can see,

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:29.280
I began exploring bodies of water
at a fairly young age.

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:31.320
But the first time
I truly went underwater,

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:32.745
I was about 10 years old.

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:35.416
And I can still vividly remember
furiously finning

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.915
to reach this old, encrusted
cannon on a shallow coral reef.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.107
And when I finally managed
to grab hold of it,

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.216
I looked up, and I was instantly
surrounded by fish

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.189
in all colors of the rainbow.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.816
That was the day
I fell in love with the ocean.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.205
Thomas Peschak

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:51.912
Conservation Photographer

00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:54.641
In my 40 years on this planet,

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:56.523
I've had the great privilege to explore

00:00:56.547 --> 00:00:58.635
some of its most incredible seascapes

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.647
for National Geographic Magazine

00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:02.298
and the Save Our Seas Foundation.

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:05.438
I've photographed everything
from really, really big sharks

00:01:05.462 --> 00:01:08.655
to dainty ones that fit
in the palm of your hand.

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.631
I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath
of humpback whales

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:13.266
feeding just feet away from me

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.114
in the cold seas off Canada's
Great Bear Rainforest.

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:19.075
And I've been privy to the mating rituals
of green sea turtles

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:20.437
in the Mozambique Channel.

00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:24.185
Everyone on this planet affects
and is affected by the ocean.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.962
And the pristine seas
I used to dream of as a child

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.678
are becoming harder and harder to find.

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:31.797
They are becoming more compressed

00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:33.667
and more threatened.

00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:36.245
As we humans continue to maintain our role

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:38.610
as the leading predator on earth,

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:43.053
I've witnessed and photographed
many of these ripple effects firsthand.

00:01:43.077 --> 00:01:46.249
For a long time, I thought
I had to shock my audience

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:48.582
out of their indifference
with disturbing images.

00:01:48.606 --> 00:01:50.506
And while this approach has merits,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.876
I have come full circle.

00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:54.987
I believe that the best way
for me to effect change

00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:56.608
is to sell love.

00:01:56.632 --> 00:01:58.679
I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts

00:01:58.703 --> 00:02:00.188
and as a photographer,

00:02:00.212 --> 00:02:02.022
I have the rare opportunity

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:04.368
to reveal animals and entire ecosystems

00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:07.433
that lie hidden beneath
the ocean's surface.

00:02:07.457 --> 00:02:10.242
You can't love something
and become a champion for it

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:12.401
if you don't know it exists.

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:16.647
Uncovering this -- that is the power
of conservation photography.

00:02:17.154 --> 00:02:19.154
(Music)

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:23.361
I've visited hundreds of marine locations,

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:25.311
but there are a handful of seascapes

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:27.349
that have touched me incredibly deeply.

00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:31.646
The first time I experienced
that kind of high

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.063
was about 10 years ago,

00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:35.922
off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.

00:02:35.946 --> 00:02:37.292
And every June and July,

00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:39.725
enormous shoals of sardines
travel northwards

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.074
in a mass migration
we call the Sardine Run.

00:02:42.098 --> 00:02:44.707
And boy, do those fish
have good reason to run.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:49.020
In hot pursuit are hoards
of hungry and agile predators.

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:50.902
Common dolphins hunt together

00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:53.847
and they can separate some
of the sardines from the main shoal

00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:55.275
and they create bait balls.

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.987
They drive and trap the fish upward
against the ocean surface

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.579
and then they rush in to dine

00:03:00.603 --> 00:03:03.414
on this pulsating and movable feast.

00:03:03.438 --> 00:03:05.234
Close behind are sharks.

00:03:05.258 --> 00:03:06.413
Now, most people believe

00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:08.814
that sharks and dolphins
are these mortal enemies,

00:03:08.838 --> 00:03:11.610
but during the Sardine Run,
they actually coexist.

00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:15.805
In fact, dolphins actually
help sharks feed more effectively.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.411
Without dolphins, the bait balls
are more dispersed

00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:23.173
and sharks often end up
with what I call a sardine donut,

00:03:23.197 --> 00:03:24.657
or a mouth full of water.

00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:28.722
Now, while I've had a few spicy moments
with sharks on the sardine run,

00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:30.812
I know they don't see me as prey.

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:34.039
However, I get bumped and tail-slapped
just like any other guest

00:03:34.063 --> 00:03:35.832
at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:40.714
From the shores of Africa we travel east,

00:03:40.738 --> 00:03:42.839
across the vastness
that is the Indian Ocean

00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:46.755
to the Maldives, an archipelago
of coral islands.

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.317
And during the stormy southwest monsoon,

00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:51.651
manta rays from all across the archipelago

00:03:51.675 --> 00:03:54.928
travel to a tiny speck
in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.

00:03:54.952 --> 00:03:56.135
Armies of crustaceans,

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.373
most no bigger than the size
of your pupils,

00:03:58.397 --> 00:04:01.582
are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:04.968
When plankton concentrations
become patchy,

00:04:04.992 --> 00:04:06.178
manta rays feed alone

00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:08.914
and they somersault themselves
backwards again and again,

00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:11.289
very much like a puppy
chasing its own tail.

00:04:11.757 --> 00:04:13.757
(Music)

00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:17.504
However, when plankton densities increase,

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:21.727
the mantas line up head-to-tail
to form these long feeding chains,

00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:25.075
and any tasty morsel that escapes
the first or second manta in line

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.555
is surely to be gobbled up
by the next or the one after.

00:04:29.912 --> 00:04:31.808
As plankton levels peak in the bay,

00:04:31.832 --> 00:04:34.037
the mantas swim closer and closer together

00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:36.422
in a unique behavior
we call cyclone feeding.

00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:39.122
And as they swirl in tight formation,

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:40.817
this multi-step column of mantas

00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:44.718
creates its own vortex, sucking in
and delivering the plankton

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:47.550
right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:51.916
The experience of diving
amongst such masses of hundreds of rays

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.968
is truly unforgettable.

00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.881
(Music)

00:05:42.248 --> 00:05:43.929
When I first photographed Hanifaru,

00:05:43.953 --> 00:05:45.515
the site enjoyed no protection

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.162
and was threatened by development.

00:05:47.186 --> 00:05:49.289
And working with NGOs
like the Manta Trust,

00:05:49.313 --> 00:05:51.194
my images eventually helped Hanifaru

00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:53.645
become a marine-protected area.

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.745
Now, fisherman from neighboring islands,

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:57.439
they once hunted these manta rays

00:05:57.463 --> 00:06:00.087
to make traditional drums
from their skins.

00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:03.786
Today, they are the most ardent
conservation champions

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.087
and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy

00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:09.824
in excess of 8 million dollars
every single year.

00:06:11.182 --> 00:06:13.531
I have always wanted
to travel back in time

00:06:13.555 --> 00:06:16.145
to an era where maps were mostly blank

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.098
or they read, "There be dragons."

00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:21.706
And today, the closest I've come
is visiting remote atolls

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.422
in the western Indian Ocean.

00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:26.667
Far, far away from shipping lanes
and fishing fleets,

00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:30.025
diving into these waters
is a poignant reminder

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:32.477
of what our oceans once looked like.

00:06:32.501 --> 00:06:35.130
Very few people have heard
of Bassas da India,

00:06:35.154 --> 00:06:38.575
a tiny speck of coral
in the Mozambique Channel.

00:06:39.202 --> 00:06:42.345
Its reef forms a protective outer barrier

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:45.045
and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:46.584
for Galapagos sharks.

00:06:46.608 --> 00:06:51.215
These sharks are anything but shy,
even during the day.

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:53.858
I had a bit of a hunch
that they'd be even bolder

00:06:53.882 --> 00:06:55.493
and more abundant at night.

00:06:56.072 --> 00:06:58.072
(Music)

00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:06.052
Never before have I encountered

00:07:06.076 --> 00:07:09.349
so many sharks on a single coral outcrop.

00:07:09.373 --> 00:07:12.378
Capturing and sharing moments like this --

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.084
that reminds me why I chose my path.

00:07:17.488 --> 00:07:21.246
Earlier this year, I was on assignment
for National Geographic Magazine

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.888
in Baja California.

00:07:22.912 --> 00:07:25.649
And about halfway down the peninsula
on the Pacific side

00:07:25.673 --> 00:07:27.112
lies San Ignacio Lagoon,

00:07:27.136 --> 00:07:29.650
a critical calving ground for gray whales.

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:33.940
For 100 years, this coast was the scene
of a wholesale slaughter,

00:07:33.964 --> 00:07:36.376
where more than 20,000
gray whales were killed,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.674
leaving only a few hundred survivors.

00:07:38.698 --> 00:07:41.368
Today the descendents of these same whales

00:07:41.392 --> 00:07:43.255
nudge their youngsters to the surface

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:46.334
to play and even interact with us.

00:07:47.247 --> 00:07:49.247
(Music)

00:07:56.577 --> 00:08:00.997
This species truly has made
a remarkable comeback.

00:08:02.568 --> 00:08:05.539
Now, on the other side
of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo,

00:08:05.563 --> 00:08:07.236
a sleepy fishing village.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.694
Decades of overfishing
had brought them close to collapse.

00:08:10.718 --> 00:08:13.178
In 1995, local fisherman
convinced the authorities

00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:15.454
to proclaim their waters a marine reserve.

00:08:15.478 --> 00:08:19.031
But what happened next
was nothing short of miraculous.

00:08:19.055 --> 00:08:23.325
In 2005, after only
a single decade of protection,

00:08:23.349 --> 00:08:27.842
scientists measured the largest
recovery of fish ever recorded.

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:30.277
But don't take my word
for it -- come with me.

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:33.039
On a single breath, swim with me in deep,

00:08:33.063 --> 00:08:36.095
into one of the largest
and densest schools of fish

00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:38.692
I have ever encountered.

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:41.485
(Music)

00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:53.969
We all have the ability
to be creators of hope.

00:08:53.993 --> 00:08:55.921
And through my photography,

00:08:55.945 --> 00:08:59.408
I want to pass on the message
that it is not too late for our oceans.

00:08:59.432 --> 00:09:02.867
And particularly, I want to focus
on nature's resilience

00:09:02.891 --> 00:09:06.877
in the face of 7.3 billion people.

00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:08.718
My hope is that in the future,

00:09:08.742 --> 00:09:10.692
I will have to search much, much harder

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.901
to make photographs like this,

00:09:12.925 --> 00:09:15.010
while creating images that showcase

00:09:15.034 --> 00:09:18.053
our respectful coexistence with the ocean.

00:09:18.077 --> 00:09:21.478
Those will hopefully become
an everyday occurrence for me.

00:09:22.836 --> 00:09:25.111
To thrive and survive in my profession,

00:09:25.135 --> 00:09:28.128
you really have to be a hopeless optimist.

00:09:28.152 --> 00:09:30.173
And I always operate on the assumption

00:09:30.197 --> 00:09:33.302
that the next great picture
that will effect change

00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:35.129
is right around the corner,

00:09:35.153 --> 00:09:37.486
behind the next coral head,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.112
inside the next lagoon

00:09:39.136 --> 00:09:41.785
or possibly, in the one after it.

00:09:42.673 --> 00:09:44.673
(Music)
