WEBVTT

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.793
All right, I want to see a show of hands:

00:00:02.817 --> 00:00:05.216
how many of you have
unfriended someone on Facebook

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.096
because they said something offensive
about politics or religion,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.256
childcare, food?

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.216
(Laughter)

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.056
And how many of you
know at least one person that you avoid

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.360
because you just don't want
to talk to them?

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.936
(Laughter)

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.176
You know, it used to be that in order
to have a polite conversation,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.416
we just had to follow the advice
of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady":

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.256
Stick to the weather and your health.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.656
But these days, with climate change
and anti-vaxxing, those subjects --

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.976
(Laughter)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.296
are not safe either.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.760
So this world that we live in,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.096
this world in which every conversation

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.296
has the potential
to devolve into an argument,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.606
where our politicians
can't speak to one another

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.936
and where even the most trivial of issues

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.936
have someone fighting both passionately
for it and against it, it's not normal.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.056
Pew Research did a study
of 10,000 American adults,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.816
and they found that at this moment,
we are more polarized,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.136
we are more divided,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.936
than we ever have been in history.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.536
We're less likely to compromise,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.736
which means we're
not listening to each other.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.296
And we make decisions about where to live,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.936
who to marry and even
who our friends are going to be,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.056
based on what we already believe.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.056
Again, that means
we're not listening to each other.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.416
A conversation requires a balance
between talking and listening,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.096
and somewhere along the way,
we lost that balance.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.016
Now, part of that is due to technology.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.616
The smartphones that you all
either have in your hands

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.296
or close enough that you could
grab them really quickly.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.616
According to Pew Research,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.536
about a third of American teenagers
send more than a hundred texts a day.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.136
And many of them, almost most of them,
are more likely to text their friends

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.240
than they are to talk
to them face to face.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.136
There's this great piece in The Atlantic.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.016
It was written by a high school teacher
named Paul Barnwell.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.176
And he gave his kids
a communication project.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.936
He wanted to teach them how to speak
on a specific subject without using notes.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.865
And he said this: "I came to realize..."

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.176
(Laughter)

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.376
"I came to realize
that conversational competence

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.496
might be the single
most overlooked skill we fail to teach.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.816
Kids spend hours each day engaging
with ideas and each other through screens,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.696
but rarely do they have an opportunity

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.296
to hone their interpersonal
communications skills.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.496
It might sound like a funny question,
but we have to ask ourselves:

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.456
Is there any 21st-century skill

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.056
more important than being able to sustain
coherent, confident conversation?"

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.296
Now, I make my living talking to people:

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.576
Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.016
billionaires, kindergarten teachers,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.736
heads of state, plumbers.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.808
I talk to people that I like.
I talk to people that I don't like.

00:02:39.832 --> 00:02:43.616
I talk to some people that I disagree with
deeply on a personal level.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.416
But I still have
a great conversation with them.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.336
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes
or so teaching you how to talk

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.720
and how to listen.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.416
Many of you have already heard
a lot of advice on this,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.416
things like look the person in the eye,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.256
think of interesting topics
to discuss in advance,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.056
look, nod and smile to show
that you're paying attention,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.976
repeat back what you just heard
or summarize it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.736
So I want you to forget all of that.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.976
It is crap.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.016
(Laughter)

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.296
There is no reason to learn
how to show you're paying attention

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.976
if you are in fact paying attention.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.856
(Laughter)

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.776
(Applause)

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.456
Now, I actually use the exact
same skills as a professional interviewer

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.416
that I do in regular life.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.896
So, I'm going to teach you
how to interview people,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.736
and that's actually going to help you
learn how to be better conversationalists.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.136
Learn to have a conversation

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.496
without wasting your time,
without getting bored,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.816
and, please God,
without offending anybody.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.056
We've all had really great conversations.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.256
We've had them before.
We know what it's like.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.976
The kind of conversation where you
walk away feeling engaged and inspired,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.456
or where you feel
like you've made a real connection

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.576
or you've been perfectly understood.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.816
There is no reason

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.096
why most of your interactions
can't be like that.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.336
So I have 10 basic rules.
I'm going to walk you through all of them,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.096
but honestly, if you just choose
one of them and master it,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.856
you'll already enjoy better conversations.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.096
Number one: Don't multitask.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.296
And I don't mean
just set down your cell phone

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.176
or your tablet or your car keys
or whatever is in your hand.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.096
I mean, be present.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.376
Be in that moment.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.016
Don't think about your argument
you had with your boss.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.656
Don't think about what
you're going to have for dinner.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.736
If you want to get out
of the conversation,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.136
get out of the conversation,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.296
but don't be half in it
and half out of it.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.896
Number two: Don't pontificate.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.096
If you want to state your opinion

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.056
without any opportunity for response
or argument or pushback or growth,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.536
write a blog.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.616
(Laughter)

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.016
Now, there's a really good reason
why I don't allow pundits on my show:

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.816
Because they're really boring.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.698
If they're conservative, they're going to
hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.

00:05:02.722 --> 00:05:04.696
If they're liberal, they're going to hate

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.936
big banks and oil corporations
and Dick Cheney.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.216
Totally predictable.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.936
And you don't want to be like that.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.496
You need to enter every conversation
assuming that you have something to learn.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.656
The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.096
that true listening requires
a setting aside of oneself.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.440
And sometimes that means
setting aside your personal opinion.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.496
He said that sensing this acceptance,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.776
the speaker will become
less and less vulnerable

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.656
and more and more likely
to open up the inner recesses

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.336
of his or her mind to the listener.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.120
Again, assume that you have
something to learn.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.560
Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet
knows something that you don't."

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.576
I put it this way:

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.760
Everybody is an expert in something.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.976
Number three: Use open-ended questions.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.056
In this case, take a cue from journalists.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.176
Start your questions with who,
what, when, where, why or how.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.896
If you put in a complicated question,
you're going to get a simple answer out.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.256
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.456
you're going to respond to the most
powerful word in that sentence,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.816
which is "terrified," and the answer is
"Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.840
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."

00:06:13.864 --> 00:06:16.936
Let them describe it.
They're the ones that know.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.936
Try asking them things like,
"What was that like?"

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.416
"How did that feel?"

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.736
Because then they might have to stop
for a moment and think about it,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.736
and you're going to get
a much more interesting response.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.080
Number four: Go with the flow.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.536
That means thoughts
will come into your mind

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.616
and you need to let them
go out of your mind.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.616
We've heard interviews often

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.096
in which a guest is talking
for several minutes

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.536
and then the host comes back in
and asks a question

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.976
which seems like it comes out of nowhere,
or it's already been answered.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.936
That means the host probably
stopped listening two minutes ago

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.376
because he thought
of this really clever question,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.416
and he was just bound
and determined to say that.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.416
And we do the exact same thing.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.056
We're sitting there having
a conversation with someone,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.536
and then we remember that time
that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.896
(Laughter)

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.536
And we stop listening.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.616
Stories and ideas
are going to come to you.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.520
You need to let them come and let them go.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.800
Number five: If you don't know,
say that you don't know.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.096
Now, people on the radio,
especially on NPR,

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.056
are much more aware
that they're going on the record,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.656
and so they're more careful
about what they claim to be an expert in

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.816
and what they claim to know for sure.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.216
Do that. Err on the side of caution.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.000
Talk should not be cheap.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.320
Number six: Don't equate
your experience with theirs.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.056
If they're talking
about having lost a family member,

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.936
don't start talking about the time
you lost a family member.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.816
If they're talking about the trouble
they're having at work,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.176
don't tell them about
how much you hate your job.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.136
It's not the same. It is never the same.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.936
All experiences are individual.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.640
And, more importantly,
it is not about you.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.016
You don't need to take that moment
to prove how amazing you are

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.440
or how much you've suffered.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.176
Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once
what his IQ was, and he said,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.080
"I have no idea. People who brag
about their IQs are losers."

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.056
(Laughter)

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.440
Conversations are not
a promotional opportunity.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.800
Number seven:

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.816
Try not to repeat yourself.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.216
It's condescending,
and it's really boring,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.896
and we tend to do it a lot.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.856
Especially in work conversations
or in conversations with our kids,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.136
we have a point to make,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.559
so we just keep rephrasing it
over and over.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.856
Don't do that.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.176
Number eight: Stay out of the weeds.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.015
Frankly, people don't care

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.655
about the years, the names,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.616
the dates, all those details

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.096
that you're struggling
to come up with in your mind.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.320
They don't care.
What they care about is you.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.480
They care about what you're like,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.776
what you have in common.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.440
So forget the details. Leave them out.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.096
Number nine:

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.376
This is not the last one,
but it is the most important one.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.600
Listen.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.376
I cannot tell you how many
really important people have said

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.296
that listening is perhaps the most,
the number one most important skill

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.536
that you could develop.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.456
Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.016
"If your mouth is open,
you're not learning."

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.320
And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man
ever listened his way out of a job."

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.136
(Laughter)

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.360
Why do we not listen to each other?

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.880
Number one, we'd rather talk.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.296
When I'm talking, I'm in control.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.776
I don't have to hear anything
I'm not interested in.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.176
I'm the center of attention.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.096
I can bolster my own identity.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.496
But there's another reason:

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.976
We get distracted.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.536
The average person talks
at about 225 word per minute,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.856
but we can listen at up to
500 words per minute.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.856
So our minds are filling in
those other 275 words.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.056
And look, I know,
it takes effort and energy

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.376
to actually pay attention to someone,

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.376
but if you can't do that,
you're not in a conversation.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.256
You're just two people shouting out
barely related sentences

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.536
in the same place.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.456
(Laughter)

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.976
You have to listen to one another.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.896
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.856
He said, "Most of us don't listen
with the intent to understand.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.560
We listen with the intent to reply."

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.816
One more rule, number 10,
and it's this one: Be brief.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.336
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt;
short enough to retain interest,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.776
but long enough to cover
the subject. -- My Sister]

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.016
(Laughter)

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.456
(Applause)

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.800
All of this boils down to the same
basic concept, and it is this one:

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.176
Be interested in other people.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.616
You know, I grew up
with a very famous grandfather,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.696
and there was kind of a ritual in my home.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.176
People would come over
to talk to my grandparents,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.056
and after they would leave,
my mother would come over to us,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.056
and she'd say, "Do you know who that was?

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.936
She was the runner-up to Miss America.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.656
He was the mayor of Sacramento.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.856
She won a Pulitzer Prize.
He's a Russian ballet dancer."

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.256
And I kind of grew up assuming

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.040
everyone has some hidden,
amazing thing about them.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.560
And honestly, I think
it's what makes me a better host.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.096
I keep my mouth shut
as often as I possibly can,

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.536
I keep my mind open,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.056
and I'm always prepared to be amazed,

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.040
and I'm never disappointed.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.616
You do the same thing.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.056
Go out, talk to people,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.296
listen to people,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.800
and, most importantly,
be prepared to be amazed.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.656
Thanks.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.960
(Applause)
