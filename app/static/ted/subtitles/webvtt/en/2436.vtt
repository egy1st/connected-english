00:00:00.811 --> 00:00:04.132
So you go to the doctor
and get some tests.

00:00:04.674 --> 00:00:07.294
The doctor determines
that you have high cholesterol

00:00:07.318 --> 00:00:10.489
and you would benefit
from medication to treat it.

00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:12.537
So you get a pillbox.

00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:14.704
You have some confidence,

00:00:14.728 --> 00:00:17.665
your physician has some confidence
that this is going to work.

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.242
The company that invented it did
a lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA.

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:24.373
They studied it very carefully,
skeptically, they approved it.

00:00:24.397 --> 00:00:26.286
They have a rough idea of how it works,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.763
they have a rough idea
of what the side effects are.

00:00:28.787 --> 00:00:29.937
It should be OK.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.682
You have a little more
of a conversation with your physician

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:36.669
and the physician is a little worried
because you've been blue,

00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:37.986
haven't felt like yourself,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.741
you haven't been able to enjoy things
in life quite as much as you usually do.

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:44.951
Your physician says, "You know,
I think you have some depression.

00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:48.107
I'm going to have to give
you another pill."

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:51.417
So now we're talking
about two medications.

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:54.545
This pill also -- millions
of people have taken it,

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.200
the company did studies,
the FDA looked at it -- all good.

00:00:58.823 --> 00:01:00.880
Think things should go OK.

00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:03.101
Think things should go OK.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.564
Well, wait a minute.

00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:08.105
How much have we studied
these two together?

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.930
Well, it's very hard to do that.

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:13.084
In fact, it's not traditionally done.

00:01:13.108 --> 00:01:18.626
We totally depend on what we call
"post-marketing surveillance,"

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.530
after the drugs hit the market.

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:23.844
How can we figure out
if bad things are happening

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:25.225
between two medications?

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:27.279
Three? Five? Seven?

00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:30.123
Ask your favorite person
who has several diagnoses

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:31.981
how many medications they're on.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.110
Why do I care about this problem?

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:35.291
I care about it deeply.

00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:39.619
I'm an informatics and data science guy
and really, in my opinion,

00:01:39.643 --> 00:01:43.388
the only hope -- only hope --
to understand these interactions

00:01:43.412 --> 00:01:46.468
is to leverage lots
of different sources of data

00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:50.048
in order to figure out
when drugs can be used together safely

00:01:50.072 --> 00:01:51.849
and when it's not so safe.

00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:54.666
So let me tell you a data science story.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.844
And it begins with my student Nick.

00:01:56.868 --> 00:01:59.248
Let's call him "Nick,"
because that's his name.

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:00.864
(Laughter)

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.089
Nick was a young student.

00:02:02.113 --> 00:02:05.192
I said, "You know, Nick, we have
to understand how drugs work

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:07.842
and how they work together
and how they work separately,

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.788
and we don't have a great understanding.

00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:12.217
But the FDA has made available
an amazing database.

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:13.940
It's a database of adverse events.

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:15.963
They literally put on the web --

00:02:15.987 --> 00:02:19.106
publicly available, you could all
download it right now --

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.757
hundreds of thousands
of adverse event reports

00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:26.541
from patients, doctors,
companies, pharmacists.

00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:28.314
And these reports are pretty simple:

00:02:28.338 --> 00:02:30.996
it has all the diseases
that the patient has,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.787
all the drugs that they're on,

00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:36.629
and all the adverse events,
or side effects, that they experience.

00:02:36.653 --> 00:02:40.089
It is not all of the adverse events
that are occurring in America today,

00:02:40.113 --> 00:02:42.691
but it's hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of drugs.

00:02:42.715 --> 00:02:44.014
So I said to Nick,

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:45.864
"Let's think about glucose.

00:02:45.888 --> 00:02:49.455
Glucose is very important,
and we know it's involved with diabetes.

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.449
Let's see if we can understand
glucose response.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.931
I sent Nick off. Nick came back.

00:02:56.248 --> 00:02:58.034
"Russ," he said,

00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:03.463
"I've created a classifier that can
look at the side effects of a drug

00:03:03.487 --> 00:03:05.538
based on looking at this database,

00:03:05.562 --> 00:03:09.833
and can tell you whether that drug
is likely to change glucose or not."

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.873
He did it. It was very simple, in a way.

00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:14.532
He took all the drugs
that were known to change glucose

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:16.945
and a bunch of drugs
that don't change glucose,

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.857
and said, "What's the difference
in their side effects?

00:03:19.881 --> 00:03:24.733
Differences in fatigue? In appetite?
In urination habits?"

00:03:24.757 --> 00:03:27.717
All those things conspired
to give him a really good predictor.

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:30.289
He said, "Russ, I can predict
with 93 percent accuracy

00:03:30.313 --> 00:03:31.885
when a drug will change glucose."

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.325
I said, "Nick, that's great."

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.245
He's a young student,
you have to build his confidence.

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.659
"But Nick, there's a problem.

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:41.643
It's that every physician in the world
knows all the drugs that change glucose,

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:43.705
because it's core to our practice.

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.451
So it's great, good job,
but not really that interesting,

00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:49.006
definitely not publishable."

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.044
(Laughter)

00:03:50.068 --> 00:03:52.618
He said, "I know, Russ.
I thought you might say that."

00:03:52.642 --> 00:03:53.794
Nick is smart.

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.023
"I thought you might say that,
so I did one other experiment.

00:03:57.047 --> 00:03:59.975
I looked at people in this database
who were on two drugs,

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:04.421
and I looked for signals similar,
glucose-changing signals,

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:06.069
for people taking two drugs,

00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:11.662
where each drug alone
did not change glucose,

00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:14.146
but together I saw a strong signal."

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.319
And I said, "Oh! You're clever.
Good idea. Show me the list."

00:04:17.343 --> 00:04:19.597
And there's a bunch of drugs,
not very exciting.

00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:23.553
But what caught my eye
was, on the list there were two drugs:

00:04:23.577 --> 00:04:26.970
paroxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant;

00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:31.326
and pravastatin, or Pravachol,
a cholesterol medication.

00:04:31.936 --> 00:04:36.219
And I said, "Huh. There are millions
of Americans on those two drugs."

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:37.489
In fact, we learned later,

00:04:37.513 --> 00:04:43.545
15 million Americans on paroxetine
at the time, 15 million on pravastatin,

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.386
and a million, we estimated, on both.

00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:48.021
So that's a million people

00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:50.498
who might be having some problems
with their glucose

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:53.728
if this machine-learning mumbo jumbo
that he did in the FDA database

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.006
actually holds up.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.957
But I said, "It's still not publishable,

00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:59.277
because I love what you did
with the mumbo jumbo,

00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:00.547
with the machine learning,

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:04.435
but it's not really standard-of-proof
evidence that we have."

00:05:05.618 --> 00:05:07.207
So we have to do something else.

00:05:07.231 --> 00:05:10.107
Let's go into the Stanford
electronic medical record.

00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:12.195
We have a copy of it
that's OK for research,

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.265
we removed identifying information.

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:17.084
And I said, "Let's see if people
on these two drugs

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.877
have problems with their glucose."

00:05:19.242 --> 00:05:21.449
Now there are thousands
and thousands of people

00:05:21.473 --> 00:05:24.932
in the Stanford medical records
that take paroxetine and pravastatin.

00:05:24.956 --> 00:05:26.755
But we needed special patients.

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.376
We needed patients who were on one of them
and had a glucose measurement,

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.849
then got the second one and had
another glucose measurement,

00:05:34.873 --> 00:05:38.488
all within a reasonable period of time --
something like two months.

00:05:38.512 --> 00:05:41.671
And when we did that,
we found 10 patients.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:47.130
However, eight out of the 10
had a bump in their glucose

00:05:47.154 --> 00:05:49.799
when they got the second P --
we call this P and P --

00:05:49.823 --> 00:05:51.133
when they got the second P.

00:05:51.157 --> 00:05:53.719
Either one could be first,
the second one comes up,

00:05:53.743 --> 00:05:56.590
glucose went up
20 milligrams per deciliter.

00:05:56.614 --> 00:05:57.772
Just as a reminder,

00:05:57.796 --> 00:06:00.121
you walk around normally,
if you're not diabetic,

00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:01.504
with a glucose of around 90.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.604
And if it gets up to 120, 125,

00:06:03.628 --> 00:06:07.078
your doctor begins to think
about a potential diagnosis of diabetes.

00:06:07.102 --> 00:06:10.093
So a 20 bump -- pretty significant.

00:06:10.601 --> 00:06:12.505
I said, "Nick, this is very cool.

00:06:13.616 --> 00:06:15.669
But, I'm sorry, we still
don't have a paper,

00:06:15.693 --> 00:06:18.272
because this is 10 patients
and -- give me a break --

00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:19.541
it's not enough patients."

00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:20.871
So we said, what can we do?

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:23.871
And we said, let's call our friends
at Harvard and Vanderbilt,

00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:26.482
who also -- Harvard in Boston,
Vanderbilt in Nashville,

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:29.327
who also have electronic
medical records similar to ours.

00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:31.371
Let's see if they can find
similar patients

00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:34.671
with the one P, the other P,
the glucose measurements

00:06:34.695 --> 00:06:36.295
in that range that we need.

00:06:36.787 --> 00:06:41.742
God bless them, Vanderbilt
in one week found 40 such patients,

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:42.955
same trend.

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:47.424
Harvard found 100 patients, same trend.

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:51.729
So at the end, we had 150 patients
from three diverse medical centers

00:06:51.753 --> 00:06:55.050
that were telling us that patients
getting these two drugs

00:06:55.074 --> 00:06:57.777
were having their glucose bump
somewhat significantly.

00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:01.127
More interestingly,
we had left out diabetics,

00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:03.468
because diabetics already
have messed up glucose.

00:07:03.492 --> 00:07:05.730
When we looked
at the glucose of diabetics,

00:07:05.754 --> 00:07:09.189
it was going up 60 milligrams
per deciliter, not just 20.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.212
This was a big deal, and we said,
"We've got to publish this."

00:07:13.236 --> 00:07:14.415
We submitted the paper.

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:16.550
It was all data evidence,

00:07:16.574 --> 00:07:19.057
data from the FDA, data from Stanford,

00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:21.027
data from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard.

00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:23.447
We had not done a single real experiment.

00:07:24.495 --> 00:07:25.791
But we were nervous.

00:07:26.201 --> 00:07:29.931
So Nick, while the paper
was in review, went to the lab.

00:07:29.955 --> 00:07:32.417
We found somebody
who knew about lab stuff.

00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:33.834
I don't do that.

00:07:33.858 --> 00:07:36.275
I take care of patients,
but I don't do pipettes.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.473
They taught us how to feed mice drugs.

00:07:40.864 --> 00:07:43.278
We took mice and we gave them
one P, paroxetine.

00:07:43.302 --> 00:07:45.810
We gave some other mice pravastatin.

00:07:45.834 --> 00:07:49.429
And we gave a third group
of mice both of them.

00:07:49.893 --> 00:07:53.839
And lo and behold, glucose went up
20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter

00:07:53.863 --> 00:07:55.034
in the mice.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:58.216
So the paper was accepted
based on the informatics evidence alone,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.134
but we added a little note at the end,

00:08:00.158 --> 00:08:03.057
saying, oh by the way,
if you give these to mice, it goes up.

00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:05.589
That was great, and the story
could have ended there.

00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:07.610
But I still have six and a half minutes.

00:08:07.634 --> 00:08:10.441
(Laughter)

00:08:10.465 --> 00:08:13.280
So we were sitting around
thinking about all of this,

00:08:13.304 --> 00:08:16.039
and I don't remember who thought
of it, but somebody said,

00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:19.264
"I wonder if patients
who are taking these two drugs

00:08:19.288 --> 00:08:22.841
are noticing side effects
of hyperglycemia.

00:08:22.865 --> 00:08:24.361
They could and they should.

00:08:24.761 --> 00:08:26.638
How would we ever determine that?"

00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:28.994
We said, well, what do you do?

00:08:29.018 --> 00:08:31.598
You're taking a medication,
one new medication or two,

00:08:31.622 --> 00:08:33.160
and you get a funny feeling.

00:08:33.184 --> 00:08:34.335
What do you do?

00:08:34.359 --> 00:08:35.510
You go to Google

00:08:35.534 --> 00:08:38.883
and type in the two drugs you're taking
or the one drug you're taking,

00:08:38.907 --> 00:08:40.510
and you type in "side effects."

00:08:40.534 --> 00:08:41.890
What are you experiencing?

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:43.390
So we said OK,

00:08:43.414 --> 00:08:46.470
let's ask Google if they will share
their search logs with us,

00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:48.327
so that we can look at the search logs

00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:50.916
and see if patients are doing
these kinds of searches.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.215
Google, I am sorry to say,
denied our request.

00:08:54.819 --> 00:08:55.970
So I was bummed.

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:59.160
I was at a dinner with a colleague
who works at Microsoft Research

00:08:59.184 --> 00:09:01.125
and I said, "We wanted to do this study,

00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:03.029
Google said no, it's kind of a bummer."

00:09:03.053 --> 00:09:05.139
He said, "Well, we have
the Bing searches."

00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:09.678
(Laughter)

00:09:10.805 --> 00:09:12.072
Yeah.

00:09:12.096 --> 00:09:13.247
That's great.

00:09:13.271 --> 00:09:14.422
Now I felt like I was --

00:09:14.446 --> 00:09:15.446
(Laughter)

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.882
I felt like I was talking to Nick again.

00:09:18.437 --> 00:09:21.061
He works for one of the largest
companies in the world,

00:09:21.085 --> 00:09:23.291
and I'm already trying
to make him feel better.

00:09:23.315 --> 00:09:25.760
But he said, "No, Russ --
you might not understand.

00:09:25.784 --> 00:09:27.284
We not only have Bing searches,

00:09:27.308 --> 00:09:30.648
but if you use Internet Explorer
to do searches at Google,

00:09:30.672 --> 00:09:32.563
Yahoo, Bing, any ...

00:09:32.587 --> 00:09:36.230
Then, for 18 months, we keep that data
for research purposes only."

00:09:36.254 --> 00:09:38.190
I said, "Now you're talking!"

00:09:38.214 --> 00:09:40.412
This was Eric Horvitz,
my friend at Microsoft.

00:09:40.436 --> 00:09:42.131
So we did a study

00:09:42.155 --> 00:09:46.774
where we defined 50 words
that a regular person might type in

00:09:46.798 --> 00:09:48.400
if they're having hyperglycemia,

00:09:48.424 --> 00:09:53.186
like "fatigue," "loss of appetite,"
"urinating a lot," "peeing a lot" --

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.977
forgive me, but that's one
of the things you might type in.

00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:58.791
So we had 50 phrases
that we called the "diabetes words."

00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:00.878
And we did first a baseline.

00:10:00.902 --> 00:10:03.606
And it turns out
that about .5 to one percent

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.612
of all searches on the Internet
involve one of those words.

00:10:06.636 --> 00:10:08.378
So that's our baseline rate.

00:10:08.402 --> 00:10:12.545
If people type in "paroxetine"
or "Paxil" -- those are synonyms --

00:10:12.569 --> 00:10:13.784
and one of those words,

00:10:13.808 --> 00:10:18.698
the rate goes up to about two percent
of diabetes-type words,

00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:21.766
if you already know
that there's that "paroxetine" word.

00:10:22.191 --> 00:10:26.738
If it's "pravastatin," the rate goes up
to about three percent from the baseline.

00:10:27.171 --> 00:10:31.561
If both "paroxetine" and "pravastatin"
are present in the query,

00:10:31.585 --> 00:10:33.254
it goes up to 10 percent,

00:10:33.278 --> 00:10:36.739
a huge three- to four-fold increase

00:10:36.763 --> 00:10:40.152
in those searches with the two drugs
that we were interested in,

00:10:40.176 --> 00:10:43.742
and diabetes-type words
or hyperglycemia-type words.

00:10:44.216 --> 00:10:45.481
We published this,

00:10:45.505 --> 00:10:46.971
and it got some attention.

00:10:46.995 --> 00:10:48.773
The reason it deserves attention

00:10:48.797 --> 00:10:53.109
is that patients are telling us
their side effects indirectly

00:10:53.133 --> 00:10:54.289
through their searches.

00:10:54.313 --> 00:10:56.451
We brought this
to the attention of the FDA.

00:10:56.475 --> 00:10:57.744
They were interested.

00:10:57.768 --> 00:11:01.374
They have set up social media
surveillance programs

00:11:01.398 --> 00:11:03.149
to collaborate with Microsoft,

00:11:03.173 --> 00:11:05.967
which had a nice infrastructure
for doing this, and others,

00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:07.273
to look at Twitter feeds,

00:11:07.297 --> 00:11:09.013
to look at Facebook feeds,

00:11:09.037 --> 00:11:10.348
to look at search logs,

00:11:10.372 --> 00:11:15.281
to try to see early signs that drugs,
either individually or together,

00:11:15.305 --> 00:11:16.894
are causing problems.

00:11:16.918 --> 00:11:19.092
What do I take from this?
Why tell this story?

00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:20.323
Well, first of all,

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:24.384
we have now the promise
of big data and medium-sized data

00:11:24.408 --> 00:11:27.326
to help us understand drug interactions

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.770
and really, fundamentally, drug actions.

00:11:29.794 --> 00:11:31.207
How do drugs work?

00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:34.067
This will create and has created
a new ecosystem

00:11:34.091 --> 00:11:37.358
for understanding how drugs work
and to optimize their use.

00:11:38.303 --> 00:11:40.962
Nick went on; he's a professor
at Columbia now.

00:11:40.986 --> 00:11:45.058
He did this in his PhD
for hundreds of pairs of drugs.

00:11:45.082 --> 00:11:47.599
He found several
very important interactions,

00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:48.837
and so we replicated this

00:11:48.861 --> 00:11:51.435
and we showed that this
is a way that really works

00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:53.798
for finding drug-drug interactions.

00:11:54.282 --> 00:11:56.016
However, there's a couple of things.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.086
We don't just use pairs
of drugs at a time.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.579
As I said before, there are patients
on three, five, seven, nine drugs.

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:07.623
Have they been studied with respect
to their nine-way interaction?

00:12:07.647 --> 00:12:11.855
Yes, we can do pair-wise,
A and B, A and C, A and D,

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:16.165
but what about A, B, C,
D, E, F, G all together,

00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:17.951
being taken by the same patient,

00:12:17.975 --> 00:12:20.093
perhaps interacting with each other

00:12:20.117 --> 00:12:23.895
in ways that either makes them
more effective or less effective

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:26.251
or causes side effects
that are unexpected?

00:12:26.275 --> 00:12:28.102
We really have no idea.

00:12:28.126 --> 00:12:31.882
It's a blue sky, open field
for us to use data

00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:34.408
to try to understand
the interaction of drugs.

00:12:34.848 --> 00:12:36.218
Two more lessons:

00:12:36.242 --> 00:12:40.441
I want you to think about the power
that we were able to generate

00:12:40.465 --> 00:12:45.176
with the data from people who had
volunteered their adverse reactions

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.469
through their pharmacists,
through themselves, through their doctors,

00:12:48.493 --> 00:12:52.160
the people who allowed the databases
at Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt,

00:12:52.184 --> 00:12:53.611
to be used for research.

00:12:53.929 --> 00:12:55.374
People are worried about data.

00:12:55.398 --> 00:12:58.585
They're worried about their privacy
and security -- they should be.

00:12:58.609 --> 00:12:59.760
We need secure systems.

00:12:59.784 --> 00:13:03.190
But we can't have a system
that closes that data off,

00:13:03.214 --> 00:13:05.966
because it is too rich of a source

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.961
of inspiration, innovation and discovery

00:13:09.985 --> 00:13:11.563
for new things in medicine.

00:13:12.494 --> 00:13:14.288
And the final thing I want to say is,

00:13:14.312 --> 00:13:17.669
in this case we found two drugs
and it was a little bit of a sad story.

00:13:17.693 --> 00:13:19.614
The two drugs actually caused problems.

00:13:19.638 --> 00:13:21.113
They increased glucose.

00:13:21.137 --> 00:13:23.583
They could throw somebody into diabetes

00:13:23.607 --> 00:13:25.901
who would otherwise not be in diabetes,

00:13:25.925 --> 00:13:29.100
and so you would want to use
the two drugs very carefully together,

00:13:29.124 --> 00:13:30.275
perhaps not together,

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:32.639
make different choices
when you're prescribing.

00:13:32.663 --> 00:13:34.509
But there was another possibility.

00:13:34.533 --> 00:13:36.877
We could have found
two drugs or three drugs

00:13:36.901 --> 00:13:39.162
that were interacting in a beneficial way.

00:13:39.616 --> 00:13:42.328
We could have found new effects of drugs

00:13:42.352 --> 00:13:44.512
that neither of them has alone,

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:47.029
but together, instead
of causing a side effect,

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:49.478
they could be a new and novel treatment

00:13:49.502 --> 00:13:51.384
for diseases that don't have treatments

00:13:51.408 --> 00:13:53.415
or where the treatments are not effective.

00:13:53.439 --> 00:13:55.834
If we think about drug treatment today,

00:13:55.858 --> 00:13:57.610
all the major breakthroughs --

00:13:57.634 --> 00:14:01.931
for HIV, for tuberculosis,
for depression, for diabetes --

00:14:01.955 --> 00:14:04.785
it's always a cocktail of drugs.

00:14:04.809 --> 00:14:06.539
And so the upside here,

00:14:06.563 --> 00:14:09.412
and the subject for a different
TED Talk on a different day,

00:14:09.436 --> 00:14:12.029
is how can we use the same data sources

00:14:12.053 --> 00:14:15.616
to find good effects
of drugs in combination

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.815
that will provide us new treatments,

00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:19.691
new insights into how drugs work

00:14:19.715 --> 00:14:23.501
and enable us to take care
of our patients even better?

00:14:23.525 --> 00:14:24.691
Thank you very much.

00:14:24.715 --> 00:14:28.214
(Applause)
