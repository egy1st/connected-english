00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.056
I'm a textile artist

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.056
most widely known for starting
the yarn bombing movement.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.016
Yarn bombing is when you take
knitted or crocheted material

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.376
out into the urban environment,
graffiti-style --

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.616
or, more specifically,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.936
without permission and unsanctioned.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.816
But when I started this over 10 years ago,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.376
I didn't have a word for it,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.536
I didn't have any
ambitious notions about it,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.096
I had no visions of grandeur.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.496
All I wanted to see was something
warm and fuzzy and human-like

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.960
on the cold, steel, gray facade
that I looked at everyday.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.759
So I wrapped the door handle.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.160
I call this the Alpha Piece.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.440
Little did I know that this tiny piece
would change the course of my life.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.976
So clearly the reaction was interesting.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.524
It intrigued me and I thought,
"What else could I do?"

00:00:44.548 --> 00:00:48.736
Could I do something in the public domain
that would get the same reaction?

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.320
So I wrapped the stop sign
pole near my house.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.296
The reaction was wild.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.376
People would park their cars

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.776
and get out of their cars and stare at it,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.736
and scratch their heads and stare at it,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.256
and take pictures of it
and take pictures next to it,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.256
and all of that was really exciting to me

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.296
and I wanted to do every stop sign pole
in the neighborhood.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920
And the more that I did,
the stronger the reaction.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.296
So at this point I'm smitten.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.576
I'm hooked.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.856
This was all seductive.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.616
I found my new passion

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.760
and the urban environment
was my playground.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.360
So this is some of my early work.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.056
I was very curious about this idea
of enhancing the ordinary,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.816
the mundane, even the ugly,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.496
and not taking away its identity
or its functionality

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.896
but just giving it a well-tailored
suit out of knitting.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.656
And this was fun for me.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.936
It was really fun
to take inanimate objects

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.640
and have them come to life.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.856
So ...

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.736
I think we all see the humor in this,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.976
but --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.096
(Laughter)

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.816
I was at a point where
I wanted to take it seriously.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.096
I wanted to analyze it.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.856
I wanted to know why I was letting
this take over my life,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.336
why I was passionate about it,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.896
why were other people
reacting so strongly to it.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.200
And I realized something.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.696
We all live in this
fast-paced, digital world,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.280
but we still crave and desire
something that's relatable.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.416
I think we've all become desensitized

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.016
by our overdeveloped
cities that we live in,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.816
and billboards and advertisements,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.456
and giant parking lots,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.336
and we don't even complain
about that stuff anymore.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.616
So when you stumble upon

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.976
a stop sign pole
that's wrapped in knitting

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.696
and it seems so out of place

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.576
and then gradually -- weirdly --

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.416
you find a connection to it,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.656
that is the moment.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.896
That is the moment I love

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.360
and that is the moment
I love to share with others.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.416
So at this point, my curiosity grew.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.216
It went from the fire hydrants
and the stop sign poles

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.193
to what else can I do with this material.

00:02:42.217 --> 00:02:46.216
Can I do something big
and large-scale and insurmountable?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.720
So that's when the bus happened.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.256
This was a real game changer for me.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.096
I'll always have a soft spot
in my heart for this one.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.296
At this point, people
were recognizing my work

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.816
but there wasn't much out there

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.216
that was wrapped in knitting
that was large-scale,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.496
and this definitely was the first
city bus to be wrapped in knitting.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.256
So at this point, I'm experiencing,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.336
or I'm witnessing something interesting.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.776
I may have started yarn bombing
but I certainly don't own it anymore.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.336
It had reached global status.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.551
People from all over the world
were doing this.

00:03:16.575 --> 00:03:19.766
And I know this because I would travel
to certain parts of the world

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.956
that I'd never been to,

00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:24.115
and I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole
and I knew I didn't wrap it.

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.256
So as I pursued
my own goals with my art --

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.200
this is a lot of my recent work --

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.376
so was yarn bombing.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.856
Yarn bombing was also growing.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.216
And that experience showed me
the hidden power of this craft

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.976
and showed me

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.880
that there was this common language
I had with the rest of the world.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.616
It was through this granny hobby --

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.776
this unassuming hobby --

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.696
that I found commonality with people

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.280
that I never thought
I'd have a connection with.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.896
So as I tell my story today,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.376
I'd also like to convey to you

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.816
that hidden power can be found
in the most unassuming places,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.080
and we all possess skills
that are just waiting to be discovered.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.776
If you think about our hands,
these tools that are connected to us,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.176
and what they're capable of doing --

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.856
building houses and furniture,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.456
and painting giant murals --

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.136
and most of the time
we hold a controller or a cell phone.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.736
And I'm totally guilty of this as well.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.056
But if you think about it,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.296
what would happen
if you put those things down?

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.280
What would you make?
What would you create with your own hands?

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.336
A lot of people think
that I am a master knitter

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.416
but I actually couldn't knit
a sweater to save my life.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.576
But I did something
interesting with knitting

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.416
that had never been done before.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.896
I also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.336
in the sense that I wasn't
formally trained to do this --

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.976
I'm a math major actually.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.856
So I didn't think
this was in the cards for me,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.816
but I also know that I didn't
stumble upon this.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.296
And when this happened to me,
I held on tight,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.240
I fought for it and I'm proud to say
that I am a working artist today.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.800
So as we ponder the future,

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.471
know that your future
might not be so seamless.

00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:08.496
And one day, you might
be as bored as I was

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.896
and knit a door handle
to change your world forever.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.136
Thank you.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.976
(Applause)
