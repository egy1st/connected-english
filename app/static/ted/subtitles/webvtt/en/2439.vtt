WEBVTT

00:00:00.873 --> 00:00:04.080
1.3 billion years ago,

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:07.174
in a distant, distant galaxy,

00:00:07.198 --> 00:00:10.552
two black holes locked into a spiral,

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.655
falling inexorably towards each other

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:14.608
and collided,

00:00:14.632 --> 00:00:17.575
converting three Suns' worth of stuff

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.428
into pure energy in a tenth of a second.

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.801
For that brief moment in time,

00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:27.950
the glow was brighter than all the stars

00:00:27.974 --> 00:00:29.635
in all the galaxies

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.683
in all of the known Universe.

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:33.814
It was a very

00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:35.377
big

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.551
bang.

00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:41.111
But they didn't release
their energy in light.

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.491
I mean, you know, they're black holes.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:50.070
All that energy was pumped
into the fabric of space and time itself,

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:53.707
making the Universe explode
in gravitational waves.

00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:56.825
Let me give you a sense
of the timescale at work here.

00:00:57.317 --> 00:00:59.928
1.3 billion years ago,

00:00:59.952 --> 00:01:03.067
Earth had just managed to evolve
multicellular life.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.902
Since then, Earth has made and evolved

00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:13.317
corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people
and even -- God save us -- the Internet.

00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:16.578
And about 25 years ago,

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:18.620
a particularly audacious set of people --

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:24.023
Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne
and Ronald Drever at Caltech --

00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:25.841
decided that it would be really neat

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:28.578
to build a giant laser detector

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:30.984
with which to search
for the gravitational waves

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.260
from things like colliding black holes.

00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:36.414
Now, most people thought they were nuts.

00:01:37.287 --> 00:01:41.201
But enough people realized
that they were brilliant nuts

00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:46.264
that the US National Science Foundation
decided to fund their crazy idea.

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:49.633
So after decades of development,

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:52.136
construction and imagination

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.144
and a breathtaking amount of hard work,

00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:59.319
they built their detector, called LIGO:

00:01:59.343 --> 00:02:03.040
The Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory.

00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:05.961
For the last several years,

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:09.584
LIGO's been undergoing
a huge expansion in its accuracy,

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:12.600
a tremendous improvement
in its detection ability.

00:02:12.624 --> 00:02:14.970
It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:18.362
In early September of 2015,

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.861
LIGO turned on for a final test run

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:24.739
while they sorted out
a few lingering details.

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:30.256
And on September 14 of 2015,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.771
just days after the detector
had gone live,

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:38.629
the gravitational waves
from those colliding black holes

00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:40.128
passed through the Earth.

00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:43.016
And they passed through you and me.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.611
And they passed through the detector.

00:02:47.143 --> 00:02:49.644
(Audio) Scott Hughes:
There's two moments in my life

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.359
more emotionally intense than that.

00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:52.922
One is the birth of my daughter.

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:57.033
The other is when I had to say goodbye
to my father when he was terminally ill.

00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:01.222
You know, it was the payoff
of my career, basically.

00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:08.146
Everything I'd been working on --
it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs)

00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:13.586
Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend
and collaborator, Scott Hughes,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.801
a theoretical physicist at MIT,

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.610
who has been studying
gravitational waves from black holes

00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:22.163
and the signals that they could impart
on observatories like LIGO,

00:03:22.187 --> 00:03:24.202
for the past 23 years.

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:28.648
So let me take a moment to tell you
what I mean by a gravitational wave.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.557
A gravitational wave is a ripple

00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:35.010
in the shape of space and time.

00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:37.479
As the wave passes by,

00:03:37.503 --> 00:03:39.882
it stretches space and everything in it

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.065
in one direction,

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:43.080
and compresses it in the other.

00:03:43.893 --> 00:03:46.942
This has led to countless instructors
of general relativity

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:50.898
doing a really silly dance to demonstrate
in their classes on general relativity.

00:03:50.922 --> 00:03:53.679
"It stretches and expands,
it stretches and expands."

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.256
So the trouble with gravitational waves

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.898
is that they're very weak;
they're preposterously weak.

00:04:01.302 --> 00:04:04.700
For example, the waves that hit us
on September 14 --

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:09.418
and yes, every single one of you
stretched and compressed

00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:11.012
under the action of that wave --

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:14.639
when the waves hit, they stretched
the average person

00:04:14.663 --> 00:04:17.774
by one part in 10 to the 21.

00:04:17.798 --> 00:04:20.670
That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:21.860
and a one.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:26.984
That's why everyone thought
the LIGO people were nuts.

00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:33.405
Even with a laser detector five kilometers
long -- and that's already crazy --

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:36.307
they would have to measure
the length of those detectors

00:04:37.078 --> 00:04:41.059
to less than one thousandth
of the radius of the nucleus

00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:42.241
of an atom.

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:44.105
And that's preposterous.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.624
So towards the end
of his classic text on gravity,

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:51.270
LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:55.495
described the hunt
for gravitational waves as follows:

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:58.670
He said, "The technical difficulties
to be surmounted

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:01.007
in constructing such detectors

00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:02.296
are enormous.

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:05.646
But physicists are ingenious,

00:05:06.408 --> 00:05:09.408
and with the support
of a broad lay public,

00:05:09.972 --> 00:05:12.947
all obstacles will surely be overcome."

00:05:14.138 --> 00:05:17.658
Thorne published that in 1973,

00:05:17.682 --> 00:05:21.006
42 years before he succeeded.

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:24.408
Now, coming back to LIGO,

00:05:24.432 --> 00:05:27.646
Scott likes to say that LIGO
acts like an ear

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.248
more than it does like an eye.

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.839
I want to explain what that means.

00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:34.185
Visible light has a wavelength, a size,

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.782
that's much smaller
than the things around you,

00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:38.305
the features on people's faces,

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:41.082
the size of your cell phone.

00:05:41.582 --> 00:05:42.789
And that's really useful,

00:05:42.813 --> 00:05:46.020
because it lets you make an image
or a map of the things around you,

00:05:46.044 --> 00:05:48.432
by looking at the light
coming from different spots

00:05:48.456 --> 00:05:49.607
in the scene about you.

00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:51.574
Sound is different.

00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:55.561
Audible sound has a wavelength
that can be up to 50 feet long.

00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:57.362
And that makes it really difficult --

00:05:57.386 --> 00:06:00.426
in fact, in practical purposes,
impossible -- to make an image

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.268
of something you really care about.

00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:03.632
Your child's face.

00:06:04.777 --> 00:06:08.907
Instead, we use sound
to listen for features like pitch

00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.049
and tone and rhythm and volume

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:15.446
to infer a story behind the sounds.

00:06:16.065 --> 00:06:17.919
That's Alice talking.

00:06:17.943 --> 00:06:19.476
That's Bob interrupting.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.750
Silly Bob.

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:24.854
So, the same is true
of gravitational waves.

00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:30.752
We can't use them to make simple images
of things out in the Universe.

00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:32.452
But by listening to changes

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:35.919
in the amplitude and frequency
of those waves,

00:06:35.943 --> 00:06:39.002
we can hear the story
that those waves are telling.

00:06:40.224 --> 00:06:41.765
And at least for LIGO,

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:45.987
the frequencies that it can hear
are in the audio band.

00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:50.563
So if we convert the wave patterns
into pressure waves and air, into sound,

00:06:51.121 --> 00:06:53.899
we can literally hear
the Universe speaking to us.

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:59.220
For example, listening to gravity,
just in this way,

00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:01.934
can tell us a lot about the collision
of two black holes,

00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.752
something my colleague Scott has spent
an awful lot of time thinking about.

00:07:05.776 --> 00:07:08.247
(Audio) SH: If the two black holes
are non-spinning,

00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:10.016
you get a very simple chirp: whoop!

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:14.122
If the two bodies are spinning
very rapidly, I have that same chirp,

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:15.868
but with a modulation on top of it,

00:07:15.892 --> 00:07:18.257
so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!

00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:22.832
It's sort of the vocabulary of spin
imprinted on this waveform.

00:07:23.213 --> 00:07:26.500
AA: So on September 14, 2015,

00:07:26.524 --> 00:07:29.450
a date that's definitely
going to live in my memory,

00:07:29.474 --> 00:07:31.719
LIGO heard this:

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:33.273
[Whirring sound]

00:07:34.416 --> 00:07:39.296
So if you know how to listen,
that is the sound of --

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.534
(Audio) SH: ... two black holes,
each of about 30 solar masses,

00:07:42.558 --> 00:07:44.250
that were whirling around at a rate

00:07:44.274 --> 00:07:46.815
comparable to what goes on
in your blender.

00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:50.133
AA: It's worth pausing here
to think about what that means.

00:07:50.157 --> 00:07:53.442
Two black holes, the densest thing
in the Universe,

00:07:53.466 --> 00:07:55.646
one with a mass of 29 Suns

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.457
and one with a mass of 36 Suns,

00:07:58.481 --> 00:08:01.154
whirling around each other
100 times per second

00:08:01.178 --> 00:08:02.336
before they collide.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.073
Just imagine the power of that.

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:06.057
It's fantastic.

00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:09.922
And we know it because we heard it.

00:08:11.827 --> 00:08:14.207
That's the lasting importance of LIGO.

00:08:15.049 --> 00:08:18.758
It's an entirely new way
to observe the Universe

00:08:18.782 --> 00:08:20.639
that we've never had before.

00:08:20.663 --> 00:08:23.727
It's a way that lets us hear the Universe

00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:25.361
and hear the invisible.

00:08:27.496 --> 00:08:29.794
And there's a lot out there
that we can't see --

00:08:30.556 --> 00:08:32.184
in practice or even in principle.

00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:34.217
So supernova, for example:

00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:38.685
I would love to know why very massive
stars explode in supernovae.

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:39.860
They're very useful;

00:08:39.884 --> 00:08:42.228
we've learned a lot
about the Universe from them.

00:08:42.252 --> 00:08:45.259
The problem is, all the interesting
physics happens in the core,

00:08:45.283 --> 00:08:47.788
and the core is hidden behind
thousands of kilometers

00:08:47.812 --> 00:08:49.887
of iron and carbon and silicon.

00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:52.216
We'll never see through it,
it's opaque to light.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.156
Gravitational waves go through iron
as if it were glass --

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.635
totally transparent.

00:08:58.512 --> 00:09:00.909
The Big Bang: I would love
to be able to explore

00:09:00.933 --> 00:09:03.772
the first few moments of the Universe,

00:09:03.796 --> 00:09:05.444
but we'll never see them,

00:09:05.468 --> 00:09:09.774
because the Big Bang itself
is obscured by its own afterglow.

00:09:10.703 --> 00:09:12.322
With gravitational waves,

00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:15.830
we should be able to see
all the way back to the beginning.

00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:18.219
Perhaps most importantly,

00:09:18.243 --> 00:09:20.681
I'm positive that there
are things out there

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.891
that we've never seen

00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:24.668
that we may never be able to see

00:09:24.692 --> 00:09:26.533
and that we haven't even imagined --

00:09:27.969 --> 00:09:30.358
things that we'll only
discover by listening.

00:09:31.255 --> 00:09:33.915
And in fact, even
in that very first event,

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:36.985
LIGO found things that we didn't expect.

00:09:37.564 --> 00:09:41.055
Here's my colleague and one of the key
members of the LIGO collaboration,

00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:44.717
Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT,
addressing exactly that:

00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:47.951
(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars
which produce the black holes

00:09:47.975 --> 00:09:49.237
that we observed here

00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:51.039
are the dinosaurs of the Universe.

00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:54.738
They're these massive things
that are old, from prehistoric times,

00:09:54.762 --> 00:09:57.408
and the black holes are kind of like
the dinosaur bones

00:09:57.432 --> 00:09:59.050
with which we do this archeology.

00:09:59.074 --> 00:10:01.622
So it lets us really get
a whole nother angle

00:10:01.646 --> 00:10:03.527
on what's out there in the Universe

00:10:03.551 --> 00:10:06.314
and how the stars came to be,
and in the end, of course,

00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:09.037
how we came to be out of this whole mess.

00:10:10.304 --> 00:10:11.956
AA: Our challenge now

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.074
is to be as audacious as possible.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.742
Thanks to LIGO, we know how
to build exquisite detectors

00:10:18.766 --> 00:10:20.335
that can listen to the Universe,

00:10:20.359 --> 00:10:23.430
to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.078
Our job is to dream up and build
new observatories --

00:10:27.102 --> 00:10:29.133
a whole new generation of observatories --

00:10:29.157 --> 00:10:31.156
on the ground, in space.

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:36.385
I mean, what could be more glorious
than listening to the Big Bang itself?

00:10:36.973 --> 00:10:38.711
Our job now is to dream big.

00:10:39.552 --> 00:10:40.783
Dream with us.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:41.966
Thank you.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.513
