00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.896
What started as a platform for hobbyists

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.856
is poised to become
a multibillion-dollar industry.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.936
Inspection, environmental monitoring,
photography and film and journalism:

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.136
these are some of the potential
applications for commercial drones,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.776
and their enablers
are the capabilities being developed

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.736
at research facilities around the world.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.376
For example, before aerial
package delivery

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.216
entered our social consciousness,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.216
an autonomous fleet of flying machines
built a six-meter-tall tower

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.176
composed of 1,500 bricks

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.136
in front of a live audience
at the FRAC Centre in France,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.736
and several years ago,
they started to fly with ropes.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.176
By tethering flying machines,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.976
they can achieve high speeds
and accelerations in very tight spaces.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.096
They can also autonomously build
tensile structures.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.536
Skills learned include how to carry loads,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.016
how to cope with disturbances,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.136
and in general, how to interact
with the physical world.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.496
Today we want to show you some
new projects that we've been working on.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.456
Their aim is to push the boundary
of what can be achieved

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.016
with autonomous flight.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.496
Now, for a system to function
autonomously,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.976
it must collectively know the location
of its mobile objects in space.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.896
Back at our lab at ETH Zurich,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.776
we often use external cameras
to locate objects,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.776
which then allows us to focus our efforts

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.456
on the rapid development
of highly dynamic tasks.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.536
For the demos you will see today, however,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.856
we will use new localization technology
developed by Verity Studios,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.496
a spin-off from our lab.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.136
There are no external cameras.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.216
Each flying machine uses onboard sensors
to determine its location in space

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.680
and onboard computation
to determine what its actions should be.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.456
The only external commands
are high-level ones

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.000
such as "take off" and "land."

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.456
This is a so-called tail-sitter.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.936
It's an aircraft that tries
to have its cake and eat it.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.216
Like other fixed-wing aircraft,
it is efficient in forward flight,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.455
much more so than helicopters
and variations thereof.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.896
Unlike most other
fixed-wing aircraft, however,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.416
it is capable of hovering,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.576
which has huge advantages
for takeoff, landing

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.840
and general versatility.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.576
There is no free lunch, unfortunately.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.536
One of the limitations with tail-sitters

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.536
is that they're susceptible
to disturbances such as wind gusts.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.256
We're developing new control
architectures and algorithms

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.680
that address this limitation.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.816
The idea is for the aircraft to recover

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.480
no matter what state it finds itself in,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.320
and through practice,
improve its performance over time.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.000
(Applause)

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.200
OK.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.696
When doing research,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.696
we often ask ourselves
fundamental abstract questions

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.280
that try to get at the heart of a matter.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.456
For example, one such question would be,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.496
what is the minimum number of moving parts
needed for controlled flight?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.096
Now, there are practical reasons

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.736
why you may want to know
the answer to such a question.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.016
Helicopters, for example,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.896
are affectionately known
as machines with a thousand moving parts

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.600
all conspiring to do you bodily harm.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.496
It turns out that decades ago,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.696
skilled pilots were able to fly
remote-controlled aircraft

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.616
that had only two moving parts:

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.480
a propeller and a tail rudder.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.120
We recently discovered
that it could be done with just one.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.856
This is the monospinner,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.136
the world's mechanically simplest
controllable flying machine,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.936
invented just a few months ago.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.096
It has only one moving part, a propeller.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.696
It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.255
no other actuators,
no other control surfaces,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.560
just a simple propeller.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.375
Even though it's mechanically simple,

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.896
there's a lot going on
in its little electronic brain

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.136
to allow it to fly in a stable fashion
and to move anywhere it wants in space.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.616
Even so, it doesn't yet have

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.976
the sophisticated algorithms
of the tail-sitter,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
which means that in order
to get it to fly,

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.744
I have to throw it just right.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.816
And because the probability
of me throwing it just right is very low,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.736
given everybody watching me,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.216
what we're going to do instead

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.416
is show you a video
that we shot last night.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.000
(Laughter)

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.640
(Applause)

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.816
If the monospinner
is an exercise in frugality,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.296
this machine here, the omnicopter,
with its eight propellers,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.400
is an exercise in excess.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.056
What can you do with all this surplus?

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.461
The thing to notice
is that it is highly symmetric.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.776
As a result, it is ambivalent
to orientation.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.496
This gives it an extraordinary capability.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.736
It can move anywhere it wants in space

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.496
irrespective of where it is facing

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.320
and even of how it is rotating.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.416
It has its own complexities,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.096
mainly having to do
with the interacting flows

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.360
from its eight propellers.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.536
Some of this can be modeled,
while the rest can be learned on the fly.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.760
Let's take a look.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.520
(Applause)

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.625
If flying machines are going
to enter part of our daily lives,

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:46.126
they will need to become
extremely safe and reliable.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.136
This machine over here

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.296
is actually two separate
two-propeller flying machines.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.056
This one wants to spin clockwise.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.576
This other one wants
to spin counterclockwise.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.936
When you put them together,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.560
they behave like one
high-performance quadrocopter.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.296
If anything goes wrong, however --

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.776
a motor fails, a propeller fails,
electronics, even a battery pack --

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.136
the machine can still fly,
albeit in a degraded fashion.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.680
We're going to demonstrate this to you now
by disabling one of its halves.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.400
(Applause)

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.656
This last demonstration

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.120
is an exploration of synthetic swarms.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.536
The large number of autonomous,
coordinated entities

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.296
offers a new palette
for aesthetic expression.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.296
We've taken commercially available
micro quadcopters,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.816
each weighing less
than a slice of bread, by the way,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.256
and outfitted them
with our localization technology

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.856
and custom algorithms.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.976
Because each unit
knows where it is in space

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.376
and is self-controlled,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.600
there is really no limit to their number.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.280
(Applause)

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.840
(Applause)

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.680
(Applause)

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.056
Hopefully, these demonstrations
will motivate you to dream up

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.480
new revolutionary roles
for flying machines.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.656
That ultrasafe one over there for example

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.696
has aspirations to become
a flying lampshade on Broadway.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.776
(Laughter)

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.976
The reality is that it is
difficult to predict

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.640
the impact of nascent technology.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.976
And for folks like us, the real reward
is the journey and the act of creation.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.416
It's a continual reminder

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.360
of how wonderful and magical
the universe we live in is,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.776
that it allows creative, clever creatures

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.320
to sculpt it in such spectacular ways.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.576
The fact that this technology

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.016
has such huge commercial
and economic potential

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.456
is just icing on the cake.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.696
Thank you.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.960
(Applause)
