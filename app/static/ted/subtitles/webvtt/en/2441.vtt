WEBVTT

00:00:00.806 --> 00:00:04.986
I was excited to be a part
of the "Dream" theme,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.389
and then I found out I'm leading off
the "Nightmare?" section of it.

00:00:08.413 --> 00:00:11.948
(Laughter)

00:00:11.972 --> 00:00:16.438
And certainly there are things
about the climate crisis that qualify.

00:00:16.462 --> 00:00:18.725
And I have some bad news,

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.915
but I have a lot more good news.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.336
I'm going to propose three questions

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.100
and the answer to the first one

00:00:27.124 --> 00:00:29.491
necessarily involves a little bad news.

00:00:29.515 --> 00:00:34.924
But -- hang on, because the answers
to the second and third questions

00:00:34.948 --> 00:00:37.061
really are very positive.

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:41.447
So the first question is,
"Do we really have to change?"

00:00:42.106 --> 00:00:47.231
And of course, the Apollo Mission,
among other things

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:49.576
changed the environmental movement,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.432
really launched the modern
environmental movement.

00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:56.913
18 months after this Earthrise picture
was first seen on earth,

00:00:56.937 --> 00:00:59.537
the first Earth Day was organized.

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:02.300
And we learned a lot about ourselves

00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:05.214
looking back at our planet from space.

00:01:05.238 --> 00:01:07.031
And one of the things that we learned

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:09.498
confirmed what the scientists
have long told us.

00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:11.564
One of the most essential facts

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:14.408
about the climate crisis
has to do with the sky.

00:01:14.432 --> 00:01:16.208
As this picture illustrates,

00:01:16.232 --> 00:01:19.273
the sky is not the vast
and limitless expanse

00:01:19.297 --> 00:01:22.129
that appears when we look up
from the ground.

00:01:22.153 --> 00:01:26.006
It is a very thin shell of atmosphere

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.425
surrounding the planet.

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:33.645
That right now is the open sewer
for our industrial civilization

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:35.549
as it's currently organized.

00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:39.195
We are spewing 110 million tons

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.187
of heat-trapping global warming pollution
into it every 24 hours,

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:45.767
free of charge, go ahead.

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.028
And there are many sources
of the greenhouse gases,

00:01:49.052 --> 00:01:51.292
I'm certainly not going
to go through them all.

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:53.010
I'm going to focus on the main one,

00:01:53.034 --> 00:01:57.422
but agriculture is involved,
diet is involved, population is involved.

00:01:57.446 --> 00:01:59.929
Management of forests, transportation,

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.021
the oceans, the melting of the permafrost.

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:04.864
But I'm going to focus
on the heart of the problem,

00:02:04.888 --> 00:02:09.403
which is the fact that we still rely
on dirty, carbon-based fuels

00:02:09.427 --> 00:02:15.866
for 85 percent of all the energy
that our world burns every year.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.566
And you can see from this image
that after World War II,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.498
the emission rates
started really accelerating.

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:25.851
And the accumulated amount
of man-made, global warming pollution

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:27.401
that is up in the atmosphere now

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:31.159
traps as much extra heat energy
as would be released

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:36.632
by 400,000 Hiroshima-class
atomic bombs exploding

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.669
every 24 hours, 365 days a year.

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.312
Fact-checked over and over again,

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:44.533
conservative, it's the truth.

00:02:44.557 --> 00:02:46.653
Now it's a big planet, but --

00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:49.132
(Explosion sound)

00:02:49.156 --> 00:02:50.779
that is a lot of energy,

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:56.206
particularly when you multiply it
400,000 times per day.

00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:58.390
And all that extra heat energy

00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:01.390
is heating up the atmosphere,
the whole earth system.

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:03.364
Let's look at the atmosphere.

00:03:03.388 --> 00:03:04.678
This is a depiction

00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:10.167
of what we used to think of as
the normal distribution of temperatures.

00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:13.278
The white represents
normal temperature days;

00:03:13.302 --> 00:03:16.343
1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:18.247
The blue are cooler than average days,

00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:20.522
the red are warmer than average days.

00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:24.704
But the entire curve has moved
to the right in the 1980s.

00:03:24.728 --> 00:03:26.879
And you'll see
in the lower right-hand corner

00:03:26.903 --> 00:03:29.346
the appearance of statistically
significant numbers

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.948
of extremely hot days.

00:03:30.972 --> 00:03:32.945
In the 90s, the curve shifted further.

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.660
And in the last 10 years,
you see the extremely hot days

00:03:36.684 --> 00:03:40.351
are now more numerous
than the cooler than average days.

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:45.831
In fact, they are 150 times more common
on the surface of the earth

00:03:45.855 --> 00:03:49.236
than they were just 30 years ago.

00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:52.783
So we're having
record-breaking temperatures.

00:03:52.807 --> 00:03:56.130
Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years
ever measured with instruments

00:03:56.154 --> 00:03:57.693
have been in this young century.

00:03:57.717 --> 00:04:00.250
The hottest of all was last year.

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:03.771
Last month was the 371st month in a row

00:04:03.795 --> 00:04:05.962
warmer than the 20th-century average.

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:09.166
And for the first time,
not only the warmest January,

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.251
but for the first time, it was more
than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:16.357
than the average.

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:20.285
These higher temperatures
are having an effect on animals,

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:23.372
plants, people, ecosystems.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:28.318
But on a global basis, 93 percent
of all the extra heat energy

00:04:28.342 --> 00:04:29.758
is trapped in the oceans.

00:04:30.116 --> 00:04:32.323
And the scientists can measure
the heat buildup

00:04:32.347 --> 00:04:33.616
much more precisely now

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.871
at all depths: deep, mid-ocean,

00:04:35.895 --> 00:04:37.935
the first few hundred meters.

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:40.554
And this, too, is accelerating.

00:04:40.578 --> 00:04:42.207
It goes back more than a century.

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:46.618
And more than half of the increase
has been in the last 19 years.

00:04:46.642 --> 00:04:47.965
This has consequences.

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:49.532
The first order of consequence:

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:51.510
the ocean-based storms get stronger.

00:04:51.534 --> 00:04:53.986
Super Typhoon Haiyan
went over areas of the Pacific

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.329
five and a half degrees Fahrenheit
warmer than normal

00:04:57.353 --> 00:04:59.846
before it slammed into Tacloban,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.893
as the most destructive storm
ever to make landfall.

00:05:03.917 --> 00:05:08.537
Pope Francis, who has made
such a difference to this whole issue,

00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:10.866
visited Tacloban right after that.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.469
Superstorm Sandy went over
areas of the Atlantic

00:05:13.493 --> 00:05:15.851
nine degrees warmer than normal

00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:18.762
before slamming into
New York and New Jersey.

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:23.122
The second order of consequences
are affecting all of us right now.

00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:28.877
The warmer oceans are evaporating
much more water vapor into the skies.

00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:32.731
Average humidity worldwide
has gone up four percent.

00:05:32.755 --> 00:05:35.448
And it creates these atmospheric rivers.

00:05:35.472 --> 00:05:38.490
The Brazilian scientists
call them "flying rivers."

00:05:38.514 --> 00:05:43.257
And they funnel all of that
extra water vapor over the land

00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:48.543
where storm conditions trigger
these massive record-breaking downpours.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:51.307
This is from Montana.

00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:53.654
Take a look at this storm last August.

00:05:53.678 --> 00:05:55.997
As it moves over Tucson, Arizona.

00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:59.805
It literally splashes off the city.

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:03.032
These downpours are really unusual.

00:06:03.056 --> 00:06:06.207
Last July in Houston, Texas,

00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.185
it rained for two days,
162 billion gallons.

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:13.272
That represents more than two days
of the full flow of Niagara Falls

00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:14.541
in the middle of the city,

00:06:14.565 --> 00:06:16.468
which was, of course, paralyzed.

00:06:16.492 --> 00:06:20.840
These record downpours are creating
historic floods and mudslides.

00:06:20.864 --> 00:06:24.278
This one is from Chile last year.

00:06:25.175 --> 00:06:28.318
And you'll see that warehouse going by.

00:06:28.342 --> 00:06:30.946
There are oil tankers cars going by.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.906
This is from Spain last September,

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.024
you could call this the running
of the cars and trucks, I guess.

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:40.693
Every night on the TV news now
is like a nature hike

00:06:40.717 --> 00:06:42.248
through the Book of Revelation.

00:06:42.575 --> 00:06:44.966
(Laughter)

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.351
I mean, really.

00:06:47.056 --> 00:06:49.702
The insurance industry
has certainly noticed,

00:06:49.726 --> 00:06:51.946
the losses have been mounting up.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.568
They're not under any illusions
about what's happening.

00:06:55.972 --> 00:07:01.242
And the causality requires
a moment of discussion.

00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:04.580
We're used to thinking of linear cause
and linear effect --

00:07:04.604 --> 00:07:05.755
one cause, one effect.

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:08.581
This is systemic causation.

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:11.248
As the great Kevin Trenberth says,

00:07:11.272 --> 00:07:12.732
"All storms are different now.

00:07:12.756 --> 00:07:14.995
There's so much extra energy
in the atmosphere,

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:16.684
there's so much extra water vapor.

00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:19.701
Every storm is different now."

00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:24.066
So, the same extra heat pulls
the soil moisture out of the ground

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.500
and causes these deeper, longer,
more pervasive droughts

00:07:28.524 --> 00:07:30.614
and many of them are underway right now.

00:07:30.638 --> 00:07:32.152
It dries out the vegetation

00:07:32.176 --> 00:07:35.838
and causes more fires
in the western part of North America.

00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:39.321
There's certainly been evidence
of that, a lot of them.

00:07:39.345 --> 00:07:40.496
More lightning,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.302
as the heat energy builds up,
there's a considerable amount

00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:46.146
of additional lightning also.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:53.578
These climate-related disasters also have
geopolitical consequences

00:07:53.602 --> 00:07:55.412
and create instability.

00:07:55.436 --> 00:08:00.712
The climate-related historic drought
that started in Syria in 2006

00:08:00.736 --> 00:08:03.688
destroyed 60 percent
of the farms in Syria,

00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:06.053
killed 80 percent of the livestock,

00:08:06.077 --> 00:08:10.296
and drove 1.5 million climate refugees
into the cities of Syria,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.549
where they collided with another
1.5 million refugees

00:08:13.573 --> 00:08:15.589
from the Iraq War.

00:08:15.985 --> 00:08:20.210
And along with other factors,
that opened the gates of Hell

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:23.414
that people are trying to close now.

00:08:23.438 --> 00:08:25.852
The US Defense Department has long warned

00:08:25.876 --> 00:08:28.174
of consequences from the climate crisis,

00:08:28.198 --> 00:08:32.725
including refugees,
food and water shortages

00:08:32.749 --> 00:08:34.629
and pandemic disease.

00:08:34.653 --> 00:08:39.382
Right now we're seeing microbial diseases
from the tropics spread

00:08:39.406 --> 00:08:40.666
to the higher latitudes;

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.308
the transportation revolution has had
a lot to do with this.

00:08:44.332 --> 00:08:47.997
But the changing conditions
change the latitudes and the areas

00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:51.854
where these microbial diseases
can become endemic

00:08:51.878 --> 00:08:56.617
and change the range of the vectors,
like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them.

00:08:56.641 --> 00:09:00.109
The Zika epidemic now --

00:09:00.133 --> 00:09:02.050
we're better positioned in North America

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:06.764
because it's still a little too cool
and we have a better public health system.

00:09:06.788 --> 00:09:11.088
But when women in some regions
of South and Central America

00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:13.823
are advised not to get pregnant
for two years --

00:09:13.847 --> 00:09:17.120
that's something new,
that ought to get our attention.

00:09:17.961 --> 00:09:21.109
The Lancet, one of the two greatest
medical journals in the world,

00:09:21.133 --> 00:09:25.363
last summer labeled this
a medical emergency now.

00:09:25.387 --> 00:09:28.049
And there are many factors because of it.

00:09:28.073 --> 00:09:30.870
This is also connected
to the extinction crisis.

00:09:30.894 --> 00:09:34.441
We're in danger of losing 50 percent
of all the living species on earth

00:09:34.465 --> 00:09:35.788
by the end of this century.

00:09:35.812 --> 00:09:38.574
And already, land-based plants and animals

00:09:38.598 --> 00:09:40.246
are now moving towards the poles

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.653
at an average rate of 15 feet per day.

00:09:44.661 --> 00:09:45.971
Speaking of the North Pole,

00:09:45.995 --> 00:09:51.265
last December 29, the same storm
that caused historic flooding

00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:52.938
in the American Midwest,

00:09:52.962 --> 00:09:55.145
raised temperatures at the North Pole

00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:57.799
50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal,

00:09:57.823 --> 00:10:00.261
causing the thawing of the North Pole

00:10:00.285 --> 00:10:04.897
in the middle of the long,
dark, winter, polar night.

00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:08.503
And when the land-based ice
of the Arctic melts,

00:10:08.527 --> 00:10:10.245
it raises sea level.

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:14.014
Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph
from Svalbard illustrates this.

00:10:14.474 --> 00:10:16.434
It's more dangerous coming off Greenland

00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:18.464
and particularly, Antarctica.

00:10:18.488 --> 00:10:23.178
The 10 largest risk cities
for sea-level rise by population

00:10:23.202 --> 00:10:25.941
are mostly in South and Southeast Asia.

00:10:25.965 --> 00:10:30.074
When you measure it by assets at risk,
number one is Miami:

00:10:30.098 --> 00:10:32.721
three and a half trillion dollars at risk.

00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:34.416
Number three: New York and Newark.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.736
I was in Miami last fall
during the supermoon,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.871
one of the highest high-tide days.

00:10:40.895 --> 00:10:44.027
And there were fish from the ocean
swimming in some of the streets

00:10:44.051 --> 00:10:46.202
of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale

00:10:46.226 --> 00:10:47.400
and Del Rey.

00:10:47.424 --> 00:10:50.398
And this happens regularly
during the highest-tide tides now.

00:10:50.422 --> 00:10:53.037
Not with rain -- they call it
"sunny-day flooding."

00:10:53.061 --> 00:10:57.612
It comes up through the storm sewers.

00:10:57.636 --> 00:11:02.000
And the Mayor of Miami
speaks for many when he says

00:11:02.024 --> 00:11:06.247
it is long past time this can be viewed
through a partisan lens.

00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:09.407
This is a crisis
that's getting worse day by day.

00:11:09.431 --> 00:11:11.752
We have to move beyond partisanship.

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:15.038
And I want to take a moment
to honor these House Republicans --

00:11:15.062 --> 00:11:16.116
(Applause)

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.973
who had the courage last fall

00:11:18.997 --> 00:11:23.431
to step out and take a political risk,

00:11:23.455 --> 00:11:26.194
by telling the truth
about the climate crisis.

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:29.375
So the cost of the climate
crisis is mounting up,

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:33.067
there are many of these aspects
I haven't even mentioned.

00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:35.064
It's an enormous burden.

00:11:35.088 --> 00:11:36.652
I'll mention just one more,

00:11:36.676 --> 00:11:41.403
because the World Economic Forum
last month in Davos,

00:11:41.427 --> 00:11:44.444
after their annual survey
of 750 economists,

00:11:44.468 --> 00:11:47.328
said the climate crisis is now
the number one risk

00:11:47.352 --> 00:11:49.181
to the global economy.

00:11:49.205 --> 00:11:50.523
So you get central bankers

00:11:50.547 --> 00:11:53.317
like Mark Carney, the head
of the UK Central Bank,

00:11:53.341 --> 00:11:57.377
saying the vast majority
of the carbon reserves are unburnable.

00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:59.147
Subprime carbon.

00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:02.462
I'm not going to remind you what happened
with subprime mortgages,

00:12:02.486 --> 00:12:04.088
but it's the same thing.

00:12:04.112 --> 00:12:06.827
If you look at all of the carbon fuels
that were burned

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.521
since the beginning
of the industrial revolution,

00:12:09.545 --> 00:12:13.061
this is the quantity burned
in the last 16 years.

00:12:13.085 --> 00:12:16.664
Here are all the ones that are proven
and left on the books,

00:12:16.688 --> 00:12:18.476
28 trillion dollars.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.709
The International Energy Agency
says only this amount can be burned.

00:12:22.733 --> 00:12:25.622
So the rest, 22 trillion dollars --

00:12:25.646 --> 00:12:26.843
unburnable.

00:12:27.303 --> 00:12:29.536
Risk to the global economy.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.597
That's why divestment movement
makes practical sense

00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.201
and is not just a moral imperative.

00:12:35.225 --> 00:12:39.395
So the answer to the first question,
"Must we change?"

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:41.343
is yes, we have to change.

00:12:41.367 --> 00:12:43.119
Second question, "Can we change?"

00:12:43.143 --> 00:12:45.464
This is the exciting news!

00:12:45.488 --> 00:12:48.993
The best projections
in the world 16 years ago

00:12:49.017 --> 00:12:53.048
were that by 2010, the world
would be able to install

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:55.239
30 gigawatts of wind capacity.

00:12:55.263 --> 00:13:00.254
We beat that mark
by 14 and a half times over.

00:13:00.278 --> 00:13:04.062
We see an exponential curve
for wind installations now.

00:13:04.086 --> 00:13:07.661
We see the cost coming down dramatically.

00:13:07.685 --> 00:13:10.935
Some countries -- take Germany,
an industrial powerhouse

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:14.327
with a climate not that different
from Vancouver's, by the way --

00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:15.986
one day last December,

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.448
got 81 percent of all its energy
from renewable resources,

00:13:19.472 --> 00:13:21.105
mainly solar and wind.

00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:24.430
A lot of countries are getting
more than half on an average basis.

00:13:24.454 --> 00:13:25.612
More good news:

00:13:25.636 --> 00:13:28.659
energy storage,
from batteries particularly,

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:30.277
is now beginning to take off

00:13:30.301 --> 00:13:34.094
because the cost has been
coming down very dramatically

00:13:34.118 --> 00:13:35.891
to solve the intermittency problem.

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:38.426
With solar, the news is even
more exciting!

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.799
The best projections 14 years ago
were that we would install

00:13:41.823 --> 00:13:44.370
one gigawatt per year by 2010.

00:13:44.394 --> 00:13:49.014
When 2010 came around,
we beat that mark by 17 times over.

00:13:49.038 --> 00:13:52.623
Last year, we beat it by 58 times over.

00:13:52.647 --> 00:13:55.887
This year, we're on track
to beat it 68 times over.

00:13:55.911 --> 00:13:57.101
We're going to win this.

00:13:57.125 --> 00:13:58.859
We are going to prevail.

00:13:58.883 --> 00:14:02.966
The exponential curve on solar
is even steeper and more dramatic.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.919
When I came to this stage 10 years ago,

00:14:04.943 --> 00:14:06.338
this is where it was.

00:14:06.894 --> 00:14:10.448
We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough

00:14:10.472 --> 00:14:13.661
in the emergence
of these exponential curves.

00:14:13.685 --> 00:14:16.909
(Applause)

00:14:16.933 --> 00:14:20.430
And the cost has come down
10 percent per year

00:14:20.454 --> 00:14:21.753
for 30 years.

00:14:21.777 --> 00:14:24.075
And it's continuing to come down.

00:14:24.099 --> 00:14:26.745
Now, the business community
has certainly noticed this,

00:14:26.769 --> 00:14:29.578
because it's crossing
the grid parity point.

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:32.854
Cheaper solar penetration rates
are beginning to rise.

00:14:32.878 --> 00:14:36.394
Grid parity is understood
as that line, that threshold,

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:40.292
below which renewable electricity
is cheaper than electricity

00:14:40.316 --> 00:14:42.534
from burning fossil fuels.

00:14:42.558 --> 00:14:45.251
That threshold is a little bit
like the difference

00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:49.385
between 32 degrees Fahrenheit
and 33 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:50.995
or zero and one Celsius.

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:53.043
It's a difference of more than one degree,

00:14:53.067 --> 00:14:55.768
it's the difference between ice and water.

00:14:55.792 --> 00:14:59.736
And it's the difference between markets
that are frozen up,

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.292
and liquid flows of capital
into new opportunities for investment.

00:15:04.316 --> 00:15:07.921
This is the biggest
new business opportunity

00:15:07.945 --> 00:15:09.477
in the history of the world,

00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:12.649
and two-thirds of it
is in the private sector.

00:15:12.673 --> 00:15:16.109
We are seeing an explosion
of new investment.

00:15:16.133 --> 00:15:21.701
Starting in 2010, investments globally
in renewable electricity generation

00:15:21.725 --> 00:15:23.258
surpassed fossils.

00:15:23.282 --> 00:15:25.698
The gap has been growing ever since.

00:15:25.722 --> 00:15:28.670
The projections for the future
are even more dramatic,

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:32.293
even though fossil energy
is now still subsidized

00:15:32.317 --> 00:15:35.544
at a rate 40 times larger than renewables.

00:15:35.568 --> 00:15:39.658
And by the way, if you add
the projections for nuclear on here,

00:15:39.682 --> 00:15:42.303
particularly if you assume
that the work many are doing

00:15:42.327 --> 00:15:45.041
to try to break through to safer
and more acceptable,

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:46.904
more affordable forms of nuclear,

00:15:46.928 --> 00:15:49.371
this could change even more dramatically.

00:15:49.934 --> 00:15:52.890
So is there any precedent
for such a rapid adoption

00:15:52.914 --> 00:15:54.643
of a new technology?

00:15:54.667 --> 00:15:57.127
Well, there are many,
but let's look at cell phones.

00:15:57.151 --> 00:16:00.524
In 1980, AT&amp;T, then Ma Bell,

00:16:00.548 --> 00:16:02.941
commissioned McKinsey to do
a global market survey

00:16:02.965 --> 00:16:06.581
of those clunky new mobile phones
that appeared then.

00:16:06.605 --> 00:16:09.768
"How many can we sell
by the year 2000?" they asked.

00:16:09.792 --> 00:16:12.360
McKinsey came back and said, "900,000."

00:16:12.384 --> 00:16:14.456
And sure enough,
when the year 2000 arrived,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.058
they did sell 900,000 --
in the first three days.

00:16:17.082 --> 00:16:20.994
And for the balance of the year,
they sold 120 times more.

00:16:21.018 --> 00:16:25.394
And now there are more cell connections
than there are people in the world.

00:16:25.418 --> 00:16:29.887
So, why were they not only wrong,
but way wrong?

00:16:29.911 --> 00:16:32.311
I've asked that question myself, "Why?"

00:16:32.335 --> 00:16:33.338
(Laughter)

00:16:33.362 --> 00:16:35.595
And I think the answer is in three parts.

00:16:36.122 --> 00:16:39.511
First, the cost came down much faster
than anybody expected,

00:16:39.535 --> 00:16:42.042
even as the quality went up.

00:16:42.066 --> 00:16:46.338
And low-income countries, places
that did not have a landline grid --

00:16:46.362 --> 00:16:48.590
they leap-frogged to the new technology.

00:16:48.614 --> 00:16:51.678
The big expansion has been
in the developing counties.

00:16:51.702 --> 00:16:55.450
So what about the electricity grids
in the developing world?

00:16:55.474 --> 00:16:57.204
Well, not so hot.

00:16:57.228 --> 00:16:59.526
And in many areas, they don't exist.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.696
There are more people
without any electricity at all in India

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.842
than the entire population
of the United States of America.

00:17:05.866 --> 00:17:07.370
So now we're getting this:

00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:09.232
solar panels on grass huts

00:17:09.256 --> 00:17:12.194
and new business models
that make it affordable.

00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:17.103
Muhammad Yunus financed
this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.

00:17:17.127 --> 00:17:18.835
This is a village market.

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:21.749
Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying
country in the world:

00:17:21.773 --> 00:17:24.185
two systems per minute
on average, night and day.

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:25.398
And we have all we need:

00:17:25.422 --> 00:17:27.714
enough energy from the Sun
comes to the earth

00:17:27.738 --> 00:17:33.101
every hour to supply the full world's
energy needs for an entire year.

00:17:33.125 --> 00:17:35.298
It's actually a little bit
less than an hour.

00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:38.654
So the answer to the second question,
"Can we change?"

00:17:38.678 --> 00:17:40.601
is clearly "Yes."

00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:43.397
And it's an ever-firmer "yes."

00:17:43.421 --> 00:17:46.029
Last question, "Will we change?"

00:17:46.053 --> 00:17:48.045
Paris really was a breakthrough,

00:17:48.069 --> 00:17:49.732
some of the provisions are binding

00:17:49.756 --> 00:17:51.794
and the regular reviews will matter a lot.

00:17:51.818 --> 00:17:54.069
But nations aren't waiting,
they're going ahead.

00:17:54.093 --> 00:17:56.608
China has already announced
that starting next year,

00:17:56.632 --> 00:17:59.615
they're adopting a nationwide
cap and trade system.

00:17:59.639 --> 00:18:02.782
They will likely link up
with the European Union.

00:18:02.806 --> 00:18:05.298
The United States
has already been changing.

00:18:05.322 --> 00:18:07.372
All of these coal plants were proposed

00:18:07.396 --> 00:18:09.926
in the next 10 years and canceled.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.869
All of these existing
coal plants were retired.

00:18:12.893 --> 00:18:15.910
All of these coal plants have had
their retirement announced.

00:18:15.934 --> 00:18:18.262
All of them -- canceled.

00:18:18.286 --> 00:18:19.776
We are moving forward.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.268
Last year -- if you look at
all of the investment

00:18:22.292 --> 00:18:25.235
in new electricity generation
in the United States,

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:27.925
almost three-quarters
was from renewable energy,

00:18:27.949 --> 00:18:30.461
mostly wind and solar.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:33.632
We are solving this crisis.

00:18:33.656 --> 00:18:38.555
The only question is:
how long will it take to get there?

00:18:38.579 --> 00:18:43.196
So, it matters that a lot
of people are organizing

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.358
to insist on this change.

00:18:45.382 --> 00:18:49.166
Almost 400,000 people
marched in New York City

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.037
before the UN special session on this.

00:18:52.061 --> 00:18:54.065
Many thousands, tens of thousands,

00:18:54.089 --> 00:18:56.962
marched in cities around the world.

00:18:56.986 --> 00:19:01.129
And so, I am extremely optimistic.

00:19:01.153 --> 00:19:03.708
As I said before,
we are going to win this.

00:19:03.732 --> 00:19:05.699
I'll finish with this story.

00:19:06.218 --> 00:19:08.810
When I was 13 years old,

00:19:08.834 --> 00:19:12.265
I heard that proposal by President Kennedy

00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:14.840
to land a person on the Moon
and bring him back safely

00:19:14.864 --> 00:19:16.029
in 10 years.

00:19:16.053 --> 00:19:19.037
And I heard adults
of that day and time say,

00:19:19.061 --> 00:19:22.578
"That's reckless, expensive,
may well fail."

00:19:22.602 --> 00:19:24.779
But eight years and two months later,

00:19:24.803 --> 00:19:28.065
in the moment that Neil Armstrong
set foot on the Moon,

00:19:28.089 --> 00:19:32.679
there was great cheer that went up
in NASA's mission control in Houston.

00:19:32.703 --> 00:19:35.163
Here's a little-known fact about that:

00:19:35.187 --> 00:19:37.392
the average age of the systems engineers,

00:19:37.416 --> 00:19:40.592
the controllers in the room
that day, was 26,

00:19:40.616 --> 00:19:42.175
which means, among other things,

00:19:42.199 --> 00:19:45.449
their age, when they heard
that challenge, was 18.

00:19:45.473 --> 00:19:48.675
We now have a moral challenge

00:19:48.699 --> 00:19:52.229
that is in the tradition of others
that we have faced.

00:19:52.253 --> 00:19:55.907
One of the greatest poets
of the last century in the US,

00:19:55.931 --> 00:19:57.280
Wallace Stevens,

00:19:57.304 --> 00:19:59.122
wrote a line that has stayed with me:

00:19:59.146 --> 00:20:01.629
"After the final 'no,'
there comes a 'yes,'

00:20:01.653 --> 00:20:04.634
and on that 'yes',
the future world depends."

00:20:04.658 --> 00:20:06.943
When the abolitionists
started their movement,

00:20:06.967 --> 00:20:09.174
they met with no after no after no.

00:20:09.198 --> 00:20:10.474
And then came a yes.

00:20:10.498 --> 00:20:12.887
The Women's Suffrage
and Women's Rights Movement

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:16.506
met endless no's, until finally,
there was a yes.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.301
The Civil Rights Movement,
the movement against apartheid,

00:20:19.325 --> 00:20:22.916
and more recently, the movement
for gay and lesbian rights

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.345
here in the United States and elsewhere.

00:20:25.369 --> 00:20:27.545
After the final "no" comes a "yes."

00:20:27.569 --> 00:20:32.702
When any great moral challenge
is ultimately resolved

00:20:32.726 --> 00:20:36.581
into a binary choice
between what is right and what is wrong,

00:20:36.605 --> 00:20:40.734
the outcome is fore-ordained
because of who we are as human beings.

00:20:40.758 --> 00:20:44.611
Ninety-nine percent of us,
that is where we are now

00:20:44.635 --> 00:20:47.127
and it is why we're going to win this.

00:20:47.151 --> 00:20:49.089
We have everything we need.

00:20:49.113 --> 00:20:52.528
Some still doubt that we have
the will to act,

00:20:52.552 --> 00:20:57.242
but I say the will to act is itself
a renewable resource.

00:20:57.266 --> 00:20:58.473
Thank you very much.

00:20:58.497 --> 00:21:01.968
(Applause)

00:21:35.319 --> 00:21:38.502
Chris Anderson: You've got this incredible
combination of skills.

00:21:38.526 --> 00:21:41.487
You've got this scientist mind
that can understand

00:21:41.511 --> 00:21:43.812
the full range of issues,

00:21:43.836 --> 00:21:47.488
and the ability to turn it
into the most vivid language.

00:21:47.512 --> 00:21:50.395
No one else can do that,
that's why you led this thing.

00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:53.830
It was amazing to see it 10 years ago,
it was amazing to see it now.

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:56.029
Al Gore: Well, you're nice
to say that, Chris.

00:21:56.053 --> 00:21:59.214
But honestly, I have a lot
of really good friends

00:21:59.238 --> 00:22:02.957
in the scientific community
who are incredibly patient

00:22:02.981 --> 00:22:05.752
and who will sit there
and explain this stuff to me

00:22:05.776 --> 00:22:07.110
over and over and over again

00:22:07.134 --> 00:22:10.730
until I can get it
into simple enough language

00:22:10.754 --> 00:22:11.966
that I can understand it.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.918
And that's the key to trying
to communicate.

00:22:15.497 --> 00:22:19.182
CA: So, your talk. First part: terrifying,

00:22:19.206 --> 00:22:21.143
second part: incredibly hopeful.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:27.111
How do we know that all those graphs,
all that progress, is enough

00:22:27.135 --> 00:22:29.863
to solve what you showed
in the first part?

00:22:29.887 --> 00:22:33.415
AG: I think that the crossing --

00:22:33.439 --> 00:22:36.452
you know, I've only been
in the business world for 15 years.

00:22:36.476 --> 00:22:39.754
But one of the things I've learned
is that apparently it matters

00:22:39.778 --> 00:22:42.942
if a new product or service
is more expensive

00:22:42.966 --> 00:22:45.120
than the incumbent, or cheaper than.

00:22:45.144 --> 00:22:47.699
Turns out, it makes a difference
if it's cheaper than.

00:22:47.723 --> 00:22:48.818
(Laughter)

00:22:48.842 --> 00:22:51.536
And when it crosses that line,

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.456
then a lot of things really change.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.425
We are regularly surprised
by these developments.

00:22:56.449 --> 00:22:58.996
The late Rudi Dornbusch,
the great economist said,

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.816
"Things take longer to happen
then you think they will,

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.798
and then they happen much faster
than you thought they could."

00:23:04.822 --> 00:23:06.520
I really think that's where we are.

00:23:06.544 --> 00:23:10.221
Some people are using the phrase
"The Solar Singularity" now,

00:23:10.245 --> 00:23:13.538
meaning when it gets
below the grid parity,

00:23:13.562 --> 00:23:15.610
unsubsidized in most places,

00:23:15.634 --> 00:23:17.276
then it's the default choice.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:23.290
Now, in one of the presentations
yesterday, the jitney thing,

00:23:23.314 --> 00:23:28.421
there is an effort to use
regulations to slow this down.

00:23:28.445 --> 00:23:31.584
And I just don't think it's going to work.

00:23:32.608 --> 00:23:35.004
There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley,

00:23:35.028 --> 00:23:37.109
who's the Chairman
of the Atlanta Tea Party.

00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:39.310
They enlisted her
in this effort to put a tax

00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:41.457
on solar panels and regulations.

00:23:41.481 --> 00:23:43.600
And she had just put
solar panels on her roof

00:23:43.624 --> 00:23:45.490
and she didn't understand the request.

00:23:45.514 --> 00:23:47.279
(Laughter)

00:23:47.303 --> 00:23:50.781
And so she went and formed
an alliance with the Sierra Club

00:23:50.805 --> 00:23:54.858
and they formed a new organization
called the Green Tea Party.

00:23:54.882 --> 00:23:55.884
(Laughter)

00:23:55.908 --> 00:23:56.909
(Applause)

00:23:56.933 --> 00:23:58.421
And they defeated the proposal.

00:23:58.445 --> 00:24:01.671
So, finally, the answer
to your question is,

00:24:01.695 --> 00:24:04.728
this sounds a little corny
and maybe it's a cliché,

00:24:04.752 --> 00:24:08.268
but 10 years ago -- and Christiana
referred to this --

00:24:08.292 --> 00:24:14.199
there are people in this audience
who played an incredibly significant role

00:24:14.223 --> 00:24:17.024
in generating those exponential curves.

00:24:17.048 --> 00:24:19.572
And it didn't work out economically
for some of them,

00:24:19.596 --> 00:24:22.650
but it kick-started
this global revolution.

00:24:22.674 --> 00:24:26.453
And what people in this audience do now

00:24:26.477 --> 00:24:28.982
with the knowledge
that we are going to win this.

00:24:29.006 --> 00:24:33.236
But it matters a lot how fast we win it.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.617
CA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful.

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:37.316
If this turns out to be the year,

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.168
that the partisan thing changes,

00:24:40.192 --> 00:24:43.570
as you said, it's no longer
a partisan issue,

00:24:43.594 --> 00:24:47.760
but you bring along people
from the other side together,

00:24:47.784 --> 00:24:51.069
backed by science, backed by these kinds
of investment opportunities,

00:24:51.093 --> 00:24:53.201
backed by reason that you win the day --

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:55.584
boy, that's really exciting.

00:24:55.608 --> 00:24:56.776
Thank you so much.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.307
AG: Thank you so much
for bringing me back to TED.

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.482
Thank you!

00:25:00.506 --> 00:25:03.112
(Applause)
