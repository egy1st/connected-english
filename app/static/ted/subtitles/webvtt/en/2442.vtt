00:00:01.015 --> 00:00:03.039
What do you think when you look at me?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.500
A woman of faith? An expert?

00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:08.674
Maybe even a sister.

00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:11.678
Or oppressed,

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:13.213
brainwashed,

00:00:13.237 --> 00:00:14.625
a terrorist.

00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:19.607
Or just an airport security line delay.

00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:22.080
That one's actually true.

00:00:22.104 --> 00:00:23.660
(Laughter)

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:26.907
If some of your perceptions were negative,
I don't really blame you.

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:29.051
That's just how the media
has been portraying

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:30.605
people who look like me.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.035
One study found

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.804
that 80 percent of news coverage
about Islam and Muslims is negative.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:41.064
And studies show that Americans
say that most don't know a Muslim.

00:00:41.088 --> 00:00:43.944
I guess people don't talk
to their Uber drivers.

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:45.886
(Laughter)

00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:50.964
Well, for those of you
who have never met a Muslim,

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:52.833
it's great to meet you.

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:55.688
Let me tell you who I am.

00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:59.834
I'm a mom, a coffee lover --

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:01.686
double espresso, cream on the side.

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:03.442
I'm an introvert.

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.096
I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.462
And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:16.137
But not like Lady Gaga says,
because baby, I wasn't born this way.

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:18.487
It was a choice.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.985
When I was 17, I decided to come out.

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.840
No, not as a gay person
like some of my friends,

00:01:26.864 --> 00:01:28.364
but as a Muslim,

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:31.459
and decided to start wearing
the hijab, my head covering.

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:35.236
My feminist friends were aghast:

00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:38.492
"Why are you oppressing yourself?"

00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:40.968
The funny thing was,

00:01:40.992 --> 00:01:45.960
it was actually at that time
a feminist declaration of independence

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:50.856
from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.526
to conform to a perfect
and unattainable standard of beauty.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:02:00.104
I didn't just passively accept
the faith of my parents.

00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:02.864
I wrestled with the Quran.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:07.816
I read and reflected
and questioned and doubted

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.049
and, ultimately, believed.

00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:15.868
My relationship with God --
it was not love at first sight.

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:20.488
It was a trust and a slow surrender

00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:23.525
that deepened with every
reading of the Quran.

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:27.935
Its rhythmic beauty
sometimes moves me to tears.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.104
I see myself in it.
I feel that God knows me.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.661
Have you ever felt like someone sees you,
completely understands you

00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:40.336
and yet loves you anyway?

00:02:40.923 --> 00:02:42.553
That's how it feels.

00:02:43.773 --> 00:02:46.453
And so later, I got married,

00:02:46.477 --> 00:02:48.341
and like all good Egyptians,

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:50.824
started my career as an engineer.

00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:52.848
(Laughter)

00:02:54.602 --> 00:02:58.444
I later had a child,
after getting married,

00:02:59.603 --> 00:03:03.181
and I was living essentially
the Egyptian-American dream.

00:03:06.448 --> 00:03:10.881
And then that terrible morning
of September, 2001.

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:17.363
I think a lot of you probably remember
exactly where you were that morning.

00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.888
I was sitting in my kitchen
finishing breakfast,

00:03:22.912 --> 00:03:26.541
and I look up on the screen
and see the words "Breaking News."

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:30.466
There was smoke,
airplanes flying into buildings,

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.253
people jumping out of buildings.

00:03:33.277 --> 00:03:34.940
What was this?

00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:36.810
An accident?

00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:39.647
A malfunction?

00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:44.171
My shock quickly turned to outrage.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.795
Who would do this?

00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:49.831
And I switch the channel and I hear,

00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:51.782
"... Muslim terrorist ...,"

00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:54.188
"... in the name of Islam ...,"

00:03:54.212 --> 00:03:56.561
"... Middle-Eastern descent ...,"

00:03:56.585 --> 00:03:58.396
"... jihad ...,"

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.871
"... we should bomb Mecca."

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:01.450
Oh my God.

00:04:03.232 --> 00:04:07.056
Not only had my country been attacked,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.422
but in a flash,

00:04:08.446 --> 00:04:12.352
somebody else's actions
had turned me from a citizen

00:04:12.376 --> 00:04:13.798
to a suspect.

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:19.958
That same day, we had to drive
across Middle America

00:04:19.982 --> 00:04:23.389
to move to a new city
to start grad school.

00:04:24.908 --> 00:04:26.991
And I remember sitting
in the passenger seat

00:04:27.015 --> 00:04:28.990
as we drove in silence,

00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:32.457
crouched as low as I could go in my seat,

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:37.999
for the first time in my life,
afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.

00:04:38.943 --> 00:04:42.086
We moved into our apartment
that night in a new town

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.879
in what felt like
a completely different world.

00:04:45.928 --> 00:04:49.882
And then I was hearing
and seeing and reading

00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:52.603
warnings from national
Muslim organizations

00:04:52.627 --> 00:04:55.558
saying things like,
"Be alert," "Be aware,"

00:04:56.312 --> 00:04:59.428
"Stay in well-lit areas,"
"Don't congregate."

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.071
I stayed inside all week.

00:05:02.988 --> 00:05:05.732
And then it was Friday that same week,

00:05:05.756 --> 00:05:09.152
the day that Muslims
congregate for worship.

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:14.601
And again the warnings were,
"Don't go that first Friday,

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:16.347
it could be a target."

00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:20.163
And I was watching the news,
wall-to-wall coverage.

00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:23.052
Emotions were so raw, understandably,

00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:26.194
and I was also hearing
about attacks on Muslims,

00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:29.596
or people who were perceived
to be Muslim, being pulled out

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.842
and beaten in the street.

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:32.980
Mosques were actually firebombed.

00:05:33.004 --> 00:05:34.992
And I thought, we should just stay home.

00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:38.525
And yet, something didn't feel right.

00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:41.768
Because those people
who attacked our country

00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:44.109
attacked our country.

00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:49.417
I get it that people were angry
at the terrorists.

00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:51.562
Guess what? So was I.

00:05:52.897 --> 00:05:56.034
And so to have to explain yourself
all the time isn't easy.

00:05:58.193 --> 00:06:01.073
I don't mind questions. I love questions.

00:06:01.582 --> 00:06:03.771
It's the accusations that are tough.

00:06:04.583 --> 00:06:07.230
Today we hear people actually
saying things like,

00:06:08.278 --> 00:06:11.084
"There's a problem in this country,
and it's called Muslims.

00:06:11.108 --> 00:06:12.946
When are we going to get rid of them?"

00:06:13.504 --> 00:06:16.716
So, some people want to ban Muslims
and close down mosques.

00:06:17.197 --> 00:06:20.255
They talk about my community
kind of like we're a tumor

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.920
in the body of America.

00:06:21.944 --> 00:06:25.205
And the only question is,
are we malignant or benign?

00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:28.847
You know, a malignant tumor
you extract altogether,

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:34.048
and a benign tumor
you just keep under surveillance.

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:39.332
The choices don't make sense,
because it's the wrong question.

00:06:39.893 --> 00:06:43.794
Muslims, like all other Americans,
aren't a tumor in the body of America,

00:06:43.818 --> 00:06:45.293
we're a vital organ.

00:06:46.109 --> 00:06:47.110
(Applause)

00:06:47.134 --> 00:06:48.293
Thank you.

00:06:48.317 --> 00:06:51.537
(Applause)

00:06:53.937 --> 00:06:56.503
Muslims are inventors and teachers,

00:06:56.527 --> 00:06:59.565
first responders and Olympic athletes.

00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:03.741
Now, is closing down mosques
going to make America safer?

00:07:04.194 --> 00:07:07.270
It might free up some parking spots,

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:08.937
but it will not end terrorism.

00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:12.587
Going to a mosque regularly
is actually linked

00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:16.517
to having more tolerant views
of people of other faiths

00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:18.563
and greater civic engagement.

00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:22.842
And as one police chief
in the Washington, DC area

00:07:22.866 --> 00:07:24.017
recently told me,

00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:26.901
people don't actually
get radicalized at mosques.

00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:31.017
They get radicalized in their basement
or bedroom, in front of a computer.

00:07:32.526 --> 00:07:35.356
And what you find
about the radicalization process

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.003
is it starts online,

00:07:37.027 --> 00:07:38.598
but the first thing that happens

00:07:38.622 --> 00:07:41.616
is the person gets cut off
from their community,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.282
from even their family,

00:07:43.306 --> 00:07:46.074
so that the extremist group
can brainwash them

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:50.396
into believing that they,
the terrorists, are the true Muslims,

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.436
and everyone else who abhors
their behavior and ideology

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.131
are sellouts or apostates.

00:07:57.607 --> 00:07:59.862
So if we want to prevent radicalization,

00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:03.284
we have to keep people
going to the mosque.

00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:08.493
Now, some will still argue
Islam is a violent religion.

00:08:08.517 --> 00:08:13.466
After all, a group like ISIS
bases its brutality on the Quran.

00:08:14.318 --> 00:08:17.652
Now, as a Muslim, as a mother,
as a human being,

00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:22.397
I think we need to do everything we can
to stop a group like ISIS.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.600
But we would be giving in
to their narrative

00:08:28.624 --> 00:08:33.756
if we cast them as representatives
of a faith of 1.6 billion people.

00:08:34.373 --> 00:08:37.866
(Applause)

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.326
Thank you.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:45.093
ISIS has as much to do with Islam

00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:48.168
as the Ku Klux Klan has to do
with Christianity.

00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:53.158
(Applause)

00:08:54.795 --> 00:08:59.831
Both groups claim to base
their ideology on their holy book.

00:09:00.349 --> 00:09:03.373
But when you look at them,
they're not motivated

00:09:03.397 --> 00:09:05.681
by what they read in their holy book.

00:09:05.705 --> 00:09:10.852
It's their brutality that makes them
read these things into the scripture.

00:09:12.098 --> 00:09:15.748
Recently, a prominent imam
told me a story that really took me aback.

00:09:15.772 --> 00:09:17.511
He said that a girl came to him

00:09:17.535 --> 00:09:19.924
because she was thinking
of going to join ISIS.

00:09:20.556 --> 00:09:22.604
And I was really surprised and asked him,

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:25.874
had she been in contact
with a radical religious leader?

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.193
And he said the problem
was quite the opposite,

00:09:28.217 --> 00:09:31.944
that every cleric that she had
talked to had shut her down

00:09:31.968 --> 00:09:35.565
and said that her rage,
her sense of injustice in the world,

00:09:35.589 --> 00:09:37.674
was just going to get her in trouble.

00:09:37.698 --> 00:09:41.379
And so with nowhere to channel
and make sense of this anger,

00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:43.418
she was a prime target to be exploited

00:09:43.442 --> 00:09:46.091
by extremists promising her a solution.

00:09:46.605 --> 00:09:50.871
What this imam did was to connect her
back to God and to her community.

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:56.166
He didn't shame her for her rage --
instead, he gave her constructive ways

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.727
to make real change in the world.

00:09:58.751 --> 00:10:03.443
What she learned at that mosque
prevented her from going to join ISIS.

00:10:04.983 --> 00:10:06.238
I've told you a little bit

00:10:06.262 --> 00:10:09.052
about how Islamophobia
affects me and my family.

00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:11.616
But how does it impact ordinary Americans?

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.545
How does it impact everyone else?

00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:19.335
How does consuming fear 24 hours a day
affect the health of our democracy,

00:10:19.359 --> 00:10:21.007
the health of our free thought?

00:10:21.527 --> 00:10:25.398
Well, one study -- actually,
several studies in neuroscience --

00:10:25.422 --> 00:10:29.283
show that when we're afraid,
at least three things happen.

00:10:29.857 --> 00:10:33.978
We become more accepting
of authoritarianism,

00:10:34.002 --> 00:10:36.450
conformity and prejudice.

00:10:37.194 --> 00:10:42.981
One study showed that when subjects
were exposed to news stories

00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:45.989
that were negative about Muslims,

00:10:46.013 --> 00:10:50.128
they became more accepting
of military attacks on Muslim countries

00:10:50.152 --> 00:10:54.168
and policies that curtail the rights
of American Muslims.

00:10:54.192 --> 00:10:56.349
Now, this isn't just academic.

00:10:56.373 --> 00:11:00.765
When you look at when
anti-Muslim sentiment spiked

00:11:01.555 --> 00:11:05.103
between 2001 and 2013,

00:11:05.127 --> 00:11:06.694
it happened three times,

00:11:06.718 --> 00:11:08.943
but it wasn't around terrorist attacks.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:13.687
It was in the run up to the Iraq War
and during two election cycles.

00:11:14.155 --> 00:11:18.699
So Islamophobia isn't just
the natural response to Muslim terrorism

00:11:18.723 --> 00:11:20.722
as I would have expected.

00:11:21.218 --> 00:11:25.696
It can actually be a tool
of public manipulation,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.703
eroding the very foundation
of a free society,

00:11:29.727 --> 00:11:33.851
which is rational
and well-informed citizens.

00:11:34.605 --> 00:11:37.136
Muslims are like canaries
in the coal mine.

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.346
We might be the first to feel it,

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.407
but the toxic air of fear
is harming us all.

00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:49.804
(Applause)

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.979
And assigning collective guilt

00:11:54.003 --> 00:11:56.841
isn't just about having
to explain yourself all the time.

00:11:57.777 --> 00:12:01.425
Deah and his wife Yusor
were a young married couple

00:12:01.449 --> 00:12:03.448
living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina,

00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:05.071
where they both went to school.

00:12:05.686 --> 00:12:08.101
Deah was an athlete.

00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:11.657
He was in dental school,
talented, promising ...

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.478
And his sister would tell me
that he was the sweetest,

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:18.537
most generous human being she knew.

00:12:18.561 --> 00:12:22.415
She was visiting him there
and he showed her his resume,

00:12:22.439 --> 00:12:23.701
and she was amazed.

00:12:23.725 --> 00:12:27.955
She said, "When did my baby brother
become such an accomplished young man?"

00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:33.684
Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit
to her brother and his new wife,

00:12:34.237 --> 00:12:35.514
their neighbor,

00:12:36.732 --> 00:12:38.873
Craig Stephen Hicks,

00:12:38.897 --> 00:12:40.642
murdered them,

00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:45.447
as well as Yusor's sister, Razan,
who was visiting for the afternoon,

00:12:45.471 --> 00:12:47.230
in their apartment,

00:12:47.754 --> 00:12:49.509
execution style,

00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:53.489
after posting anti-Muslim statements
on his Facebook page.

00:12:54.058 --> 00:12:55.802
He shot Deah eight times.

00:12:57.254 --> 00:13:01.289
So bigotry isn't just immoral,
it can even be lethal.

00:13:02.355 --> 00:13:03.676
So, back to my story.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.400
What happened after 9/11?

00:13:05.424 --> 00:13:08.552
Did we go to the mosque
or did we play it safe and stay home?

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.272
Well, we talked it over,

00:13:11.296 --> 00:13:13.985
and it might seem like
a small decision, but to us,

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:17.865
it was about what kind of America
we wanted to leave for our kids:

00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:21.269
one that would control us by fear

00:13:21.293 --> 00:13:24.787
or one where we were practicing
our religion freely.

00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:26.659
So we decided to go to the mosque.

00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:29.566
And we put my son in his car seat,

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.281
buckled him in, and we drove silently,
intensely, to the mosque.

00:13:33.305 --> 00:13:37.182
I took him out, I took off my shoes,
I walked into the prayer hall

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:40.179
and what I saw made me stop.

00:13:41.271 --> 00:13:42.899
The place was completely full.

00:13:43.492 --> 00:13:45.680
And then the imam made an announcement,

00:13:45.704 --> 00:13:49.970
thanking and welcoming our guests,

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:52.778
because half the congregation

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.561
were Christians, Jews,
Buddhists, atheists,

00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:59.005
people of faith and no faith,

00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:03.930
who had come not to attack us,
but to stand in solidarity with us.

00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:11.390
(Applause)

00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:15.722
I just break down at this time.

00:14:16.674 --> 00:14:21.218
These people were there because they chose
courage and compassion

00:14:21.242 --> 00:14:23.340
over panic and prejudice.

00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:26.398
What will you choose?

00:14:27.122 --> 00:14:32.143
What will you choose
at this time of fear and bigotry?

00:14:33.397 --> 00:14:35.108
Will you play it safe?

00:14:35.914 --> 00:14:38.213
Or will you join those who say

00:14:38.237 --> 00:14:40.225
we are better than that?

00:14:40.249 --> 00:14:41.400
Thank you.

00:14:41.424 --> 00:14:45.748
(Applause)

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.274
Thank you so much.

00:15:00.497 --> 00:15:04.841
Helen Walters: So Dalia,
you seem to have struck a chord.

00:15:04.865 --> 00:15:06.402
But I wonder,

00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:08.885
what would you say to those
who might argue

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:10.666
that you're giving a TED Talk,

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.245
you're clearly a deep thinker,

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:14.276
you work at a fancy think tank,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.413
you're an exception, you're not the rule.

00:15:16.437 --> 00:15:18.209
What would you say to those people?

00:15:18.841 --> 00:15:21.763
Dalia Mogahed: I would say,
don't let this stage distract you,

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:22.992
I'm completely ordinary.

00:15:23.821 --> 00:15:25.066
I'm not an exception.

00:15:25.447 --> 00:15:27.467
My story is not unusual.

00:15:27.491 --> 00:15:30.474
I am as ordinary as they come.

00:15:30.498 --> 00:15:34.696
When you look at Muslims
around the world --

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.551
and I've done this, I've done
the largest study ever done

00:15:37.575 --> 00:15:39.117
on Muslims around the world --

00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:40.591
people want ordinary things.

00:15:40.615 --> 00:15:42.440
They want prosperity for their family,

00:15:42.464 --> 00:15:43.615
they want jobs

00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:45.245
and they want to live in peace.

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:48.315
So I am not in any way an exception.

00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:51.190
When you meet people who seem
like an exception to the rule,

00:15:51.214 --> 00:15:53.540
oftentimes it's that the rule is broken,

00:15:54.292 --> 00:15:56.512
not that they're an exception to it.

00:15:56.536 --> 00:15:58.996
HW: Thank you so much.
Dalia Mogahed.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.694
(Applause)
