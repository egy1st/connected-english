00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.904
Today I wanted to --
well, this morning --

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.920
I want to talk about the future
of human-driven transportation;

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.880
about how we can cut congestion,
pollution and parking

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.960
by getting more people into fewer cars;

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.160
and how we can do it
with the technology that's in our pockets.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.696
And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ...

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.120
not self-driving cars.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.200
But to get started we've got
to go back over 100 years.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.280
Because it turns out
there was an Uber way before Uber.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.336
And if it had survived,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.520
the future of transportation
would probably already be here.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.400
So let me introduce you to the jitney.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.440
In 1914 it was created or invented
by a guy named LP Draper.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.135
He was a car salesman from LA,
and he had an idea.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.656
Well, he was cruising around
downtown Los Angeles,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.056
my hometown,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.416
and he saw trolleys

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.080
with long lines of people trying
to get to where they wanted to go.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.696
He said, well, why don't
I just put a sign on my car

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.656
that takes people wherever
they want to go for a jitney --

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.040
that was slang for a nickel.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.680
And so people jumped on board,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.240
and not just in Los Angeles
but across the country.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.896
And within one year,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.600
by 1915,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.040
there were 50,000
rides per day in Seattle,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.976
45,000 rides per day in Kansas

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.696
and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480
To give you some perspective,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.080
Uber in Los Angeles

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.680
is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ...

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.560
100 years later.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.280
And so these are the trolley guys,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.416
the existing transportation
monopoly at the time.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.416
They were clearly not happy
about the jitney juggernaut.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.455
And so they got to work

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.096
and they went to cities across the country

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.920
and got regulations put in place
to slow down the growth of the jitney.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.016
And there were all kinds of regulations.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.296
There were licenses --
often they were pricey.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.736
In some cities,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.136
if you were a jitney driver,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.360
you were required to be
in the jitney for 16 hours a day.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.256
In other cities,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.080
they required two jitney
drivers for one jitney.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.016
But there was a really
interesting regulation

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.920
which was they had to
put a backseat light --

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.816
install it in every Jitney --

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.776
to stop a new pernicious innovation
which they called spooning.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.016
(Laughter)

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.216
All right. So what happened?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.336
Well, within a year
this thing had taken off.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.200
But the jitney, by 1919, was regulated
completely out of existence.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.080
That's unfortunate ...

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.696
because, well, when you can't share a car,
then you have to own one.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.736
And car ownership skyrocketed

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.296
and it's no wonder that by 2007,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.880
there was a car for every man,
woman and child in the United States.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.640
And that phenomenon had gone global.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.760
In China by 2011,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.920
there were more car sales
happening in China than in the US.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.256
Now, all this private ownership
of course had a public cost.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.136
In the US, we spend
7 billion hours a year,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.120
wasted, sitting in traffic.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.720
160 billion dollars in lost productivity,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.976
of course also sitting in traffic,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.936
and one-fifth of all
of our carbon footprint

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.120
is spewed out in the air
by those cars that we're sitting in.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.216
Now, that's only four percent
of our problem though.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.456
Because if you have to own a car

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.920
then that means 96 percent of the time
your car is sitting idle.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.576
And so, up to 30 percent
of our land and our space

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.896
is used storing these hunks of steel.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.856
We even have skyscrapers built for cars.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.800
That's the world we live in today.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.800
Now, cities have been dealing
with this problem for decades.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.055
It's called mass transit.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.616
And even in a city like New York City,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.856
one of the most densely
populated in the world

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.536
and one of the most sophisticated
mass transit systems in the world,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.920
there are still 2.5 million cars
that go over those bridges every day.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.680
Why is that?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.480
Well, it's because mass transit
hasn't yet figured out

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.960
how to get to everybody's doorstep.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.496
And so back in San Francisco,
where I live,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.856
the situation's much worse,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.480
in fact, much worse around the world.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.456
And so the beginning
of Uber in 2010 was --

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.976
well, we just wanted
to push a button and get a ride.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.296
We didn't have any grand ambitions.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.656
But it just turned out

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.576
that lots of people wanted
to push a button and get a ride,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.160
and ultimately what we started to see
was a lot of duplicate rides.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.136
We saw a lot of people

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.176
pushing the same button at the same time

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.656
going essentially to the same place.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.256
And so we started thinking about,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.960
well, how do we make those two trips
and turn them into one.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.176
Because if we did,
that ride would be a lot cheaper --

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.680
up to 50 percent cheaper --

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.416
and of course for the city

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.496
you've got a lot more people
and a lot fewer cars.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.896
And so the big question for us was:

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.216
would it work?

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.616
Could you have a cheaper ride

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.480
cheap enough that people
would be willing to share it?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.600
And the answer, fortunately,
is a resounding yes.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.776
In San Francisco,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.456
before uberPOOL, we had --

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.856
well, everybody would take their car
wherever the heck they wanted.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.400
And the bright colors
is where we have the most cars.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.016
And once we introduced uberPOOL,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.320
well, you see there's not
as many bright colors.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.336
More people getting around
the city in fewer cars,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.416
taking cars off the road.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.360
It looks like uberPOOL is working.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.680
And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.040
eight months ago.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.600
And since then, we've taken
7.9 million miles off the roads

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.480
and we've taken 1.4 thousand
metric tons of CO2 out of the air.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.216
But the part that I'm really --

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.840
(Applause)

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.976
But my favorite statistic --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.256
remember, I'm from LA,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.536
I spent years of my life

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.896
sitting behind the wheel,
going, "How do we fix this?" --

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.656
my favorite part
is that eight months later,

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.720
we have added 100,000 new people
that are carpooling every week.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.040
Now, in China everything is supersized,

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.096
and so we're doing 15 million
uberPOOL trips per month,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.176
that's 500,000 per day.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.176
And of course we're seeing
that exponential growth happen.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.296
In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.696
And when I talk to my team,
we don't talk about,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:22.080
"Hey, well, 100,000 people
carpooling every week and we're done."

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.080
How do we get that to a million?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.040
And in China, well,
that could be several million.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.936
And so uberPOOL is a very great
solution for urban carpooling.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.896
But what about the suburbs?

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.296
This is the street
where I grew up in Los Angeles,

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.836
it's actually a suburb
called Northridge, California,

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.136
and, well --

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.760
look, those mailboxes,
they kind of just go on forever.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.000
And every morning at about the same time,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.736
cars roll of out their driveway,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.520
most of them, one person in the car,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.576
and they go to work,
they go to their place of work.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.856
So the question for us is:

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.120
well, how do we turn

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.136
all of these commuter cars --

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.440
and literally there's
tens of millions of them --

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.160
how do we turn all these
commuter cars into shared cars?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.280
Well, we have something for this that we
recently launched called uberCOMMUTE.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.593
You get up in the morning,
get ready for work, get your coffee,

00:08:20.617 --> 00:08:21.896
go to your car

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.936
and you light up the Uber app,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.456
and all of a sudden,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.200
you become an Uber driver.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.736
And we'll match you up
with one of your neighbors

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.960
on your way to work

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.360
and it's a really great thing.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.280
There's just one hitch ...

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.000
it's called regulation.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.655
So 54 cents a mile, what is that?

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.736
Well, that is what the US government

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.920
has determined that the cost
of owning a car is per mile.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.696
You can pick up anybody
in the United States

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.296
and take them wherever they want to go
at a moment's notice,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.816
for 54 cents a mile or less.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.160
But if you charge 60 cents a mile,
you're a criminal.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.056
But what if for 60 cents a mile

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.656
we could get half a million more people
carpooling in Los Angeles?

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.216
And what if at 60 cents a mile

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.400
we could get 50 million people
carpooling in the United States?

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.216
If we could,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.160
it's obviously something we should do.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.600
And so it goes back
to the lesson of the jitney.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.056
If by 1915 this thing was taking off,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.576
imagine without
the regulations that happened,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.320
if that thing could just keep going.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.016
How would our cities be different today?

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.736
Would we have parks
in the place of parking lots?

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.656
Well, we lost that chance.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.736
But technology has given us
another opportunity.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.960
Now, I'm as excited as anybody else
about self-driving cars

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.376
but do we have to really wait
five, 10 or even 20 years

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.720
to make our new cities a reality?

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.376
With the technology in our pockets today,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.200
and a little smart regulation,

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.400
we can turn every car into a shared car,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.040
and we can reclaim our cities
starting today.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.776
Thank you.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.880
(Applause)

00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:25.536
Chris Anderson: Travis, thank you.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.846
Travis Kalanick: Thank you.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:31.416
CA: You know -- I mean the company
you've built is absolutely astounding.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.296
You only just talked
about a small part of it here --

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.536
a powerful part --

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.256
the idea of turning cars
into public transport like that,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.496
it's cool.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.336
But I've got a couple other questions

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.776
because I know they're
out there on people's minds.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.136
So first of all, last week I think it was,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.976
I switched on my phone
and tried to book an Uber

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.056
and I couldn't find the app.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.496
You had this very radical,
very bold, brave redesign.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.936
TK: Sure.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.176
CA: How did it go?

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.896
Did you notice other people
not finding the app that day?

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.616
Are you going to win people over
for this redesign?

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.696
TK: Well, first I should
probably just say,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.896
well, what we were trying to accomplish.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.816
And I think if you know
a little bit about our history,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.776
it makes a lot more sense.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.016
Which is, when we first got started,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.416
it was just black cars.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.096
It was literally you push a button
and get an S-Class.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.736
And so what we did

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.096
was almost what I would call
an immature version of a luxury brand

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.976
that looked like a badge on a luxury car.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.816
And as we've gone worldwide

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.176
and gone from S-Classes
to auto rickshaws in India,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.336
it became something
that was important for us

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.736
to be more accessible,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.296
to be more hyperlocal,

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.656
to be about the cities we were in

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.176
and that's what you see
with the patterns and colors.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.456
And to be more iconic,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.096
because a U doesn't mean
anything in Sanskrit,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.576
and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.816
And so that was
a little bit what it was about.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.736
Now, when you first
roll out something like that,

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.296
I mean, your hands are sweating,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.536
you've got --

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.216
you know, you're a little worried.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.856
What we saw is a lot of people --

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.176
actually, at the beginning,
we saw a lot more people opening the app

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.343
because they were curious
what they would find when they opened it.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.240
And our numbers were slightly up
from what we expected.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.696
CA: OK, that's cool.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.536
Now, so you, yourself,
are something of an enigma, I would say.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.336
Your supporters and investors,
who have been with you the whole way,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.736
believe that the only chance

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.976
of sort of taking on
the powerful, entrenched interests

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.096
of taxi industry and so forth,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.776
is to have someone who is
a fierce, relentless competitor,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.520
which you've certainly proved to be.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.376
Some people feel you've almost
taken that culture too far,

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.376
and you know --
like a year or two ago

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.216
there was a huge controversy
where a lot of women got upset.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:54.176
How did it feel like
inside the company during that period?

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.376
Did you notice a loss of business?

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.936
Did you learn anything from that?

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.216
TK: Well, look, I think --

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.856
I've been an entrepreneur
since I've been in high school

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.696
and you have --

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.216
In various different ways
an entrepreneur will see hard times

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.496
and for us,

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.576
it was about a year and a half ago,

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.320
and for us it was hard times, too.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.080
Now, inside, we felt like --

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.536
I guess at the end of the day

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.816
we felt like we were
good people doing good work,

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.840
but on the outside that wasn't evident.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.136
And so there was a lot that we had to do

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.016
to sort of --

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.896
We'd gone from a very small company --

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.016
I mean if you go literally
two and a half years ago,

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.176
our company was 400 people,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.280
and today it's 6,500.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.776
And so when you go through that growth,

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.816
you have to sort of cement
your cultural values

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.640
and talk about them all of the time.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.376
And make sure that people
are constantly checking

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.896
to say, "Are we good people
doing good work?"

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.576
And if you check those boxes,

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.600
the next part of that
is making sure you're telling your story.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.296
And I think we learned a lot of lessons

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.496
but I think at the end of it
we came out stronger.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.040
But it was certainly a difficult period.

00:14:08.151 --> 00:14:10.056
CA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.816
you're facing people
who occasionally give you a hard time.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.616
Some Uber drivers
in New York and elsewhere

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.896
are mad as hell now
because you changed the fees

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.800
and they can barely -- they claim --
barely afford the deal anymore.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.216
How --

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.536
You know, you said
that you started this originally --

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.816
just the coolness of pressing a button
and summoning a ride.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.096
This thing's taken off,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.336
you're affecting the whole global
economy, basically, at this point.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.656
You're being forced to be,
whether you want it or not,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.136
a kind of global visionary
who's changing the world.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.816
I mean -- who are you?

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.056
Do you want that?

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.856
Are you ready to go with that
and be what that takes?

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.216
TK: Well, there's a few things
packed in that question, so --

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.016
(Laughter)

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.536
First is on the pricing side --

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.176
I mean, keep in mind, right?

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.096
UberX, when we first started,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.920
was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper
than our black car product.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.640
It's now

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.600
in many cities, half the price of a taxi.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.456
And we have all the data to show

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.656
that the divers are making more per hour
than they would as taxi drivers.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.696
What happens is when the price goes down,

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.256
people are more likely to take Uber

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.138
at different times of the day
than they otherwise would have,

00:15:26.162 --> 00:15:29.456
and they're more likely to use it
in places they wouldn't have before.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.616
And what that means for a driver
is wherever he or she drops somebody off,

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.896
they're much more likely
to get a pickup and get back in.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.456
And so what that means
is more trips per hour,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.896
more minutes of the hour
where they're productive

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.816
and actually, earnings come up.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.896
And we have cities where we've done
literally five or six price cuts

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.696
and have seen those price cuts
go up over time.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.256
So even in New York --

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.256
We have a blog post
we call "4 Septembers" --

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.496
compare the earnings

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.656
September after September after September.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.920
Same month every year.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.496
And we see the earnings going up over time

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.216
as the price comes down.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.536
And there's a perfect price point --
you can't go down forever.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.896
And in those places
where we bring the price down

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.656
but we don't see those earnings pop,

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.056
we bring the prices back up.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.216
So that addresses that first part.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.896
And then the enigma and all of this --

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.536
I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.120
is one that gets really excited
about solving hard problems.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.440
And the way I like to describe it
is it's kind of like a math professor.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.536
You know? If a math professor
doesn't have hard problems to solve,

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.600
that's a really sad math professor.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.776
And so at Uber we like the hard problems

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.016
and we like getting excited
about those and solving them.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.976
But we don't want just any math problem,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.416
we want the hardest ones
that we can possibly find,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.416
and we want the one that if you solve it,

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.240
there's a little bit of a wow factor.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.496
CA: In a couple years' time --

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.520
say five years' time, I don't know when --

00:16:59.544 --> 00:17:02.736
you roll out your incredible
self-driving cars,

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.256
at probably a lower cost
than you currently pay for an Uber ride.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.376
What do you say to your army
of a million drivers plus at that time?

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.296
TK: Explain that again --
at which time?

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.776
CA: At the time when
self-driving cars are coming --

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.256
TK: Sure, sure, sure.
Sorry, I missed that.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.935
CA: What do you say to a driver?

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.935
TK: Well, look, I think
the first part is it's going to take --

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.816
it's likely going to take a lot longer

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.136
than I think some of the hype
or media might expect.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.376
That's part one.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.616
Part two is it's going to also take --

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.496
there's going to be a long transition.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.736
These cars will work
in certain places and not in others.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.936
For us it's an interesting
challenge, right?

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.640
Because, well --

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.496
Google's been investing
in this since 2007,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.336
Tesla's going to be doing it,
Apple's going to be doing it,

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.416
the manufacturers
are going to be doing it.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.600
This is a world that's going to exist,
and for good reason.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.936
A million people die a year in cars.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.496
And we already looked at the billions
or even trillions of hours worldwide

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.776
that people are spending sitting in them,
driving frustrated, anxious.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.736
And think about the quality
of life that improves

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.696
when you give people their time back

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.296
and it's not so anxiety-ridden.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.736
So I think there's a lot of good.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.616
And so the way we think about it
is that it's a challenge,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.096
but one for optimistic leadership,

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.936
Where instead of resisting --

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.176
resisting technology,

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.000
maybe like the taxi industry,
or the trolley industry --

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.256
we have to embrace it
or be a part of the future.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.416
But how do we optimistically
lead through it?

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.376
Are there ways to partner with cities?

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.136
Are there ways to have education systems,
vocational training, etc.,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.576
for that transition period.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.096
It will take a lot longer
than I think we all expect,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.776
especially that transition period.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.216
But it is a world that's going to exist,

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.240
and it is going to be a better world.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.776
CA: Travis, what you're building
is absolutely incredible

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.136
and I'm hugely grateful to you
for coming to TED and sharing so openly.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.216
Thank you so much.
TK: Thank you very much.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.720
(Applause)
