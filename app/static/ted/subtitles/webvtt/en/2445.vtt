00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.096
When I moved to Harare in 1985,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.896
social justice was at the core
of Zimbabwe's national health policy.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.616
The new government emerged
from a long war of independence

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.456
and immediately proclaimed
a socialist agenda:

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.856
health care services, primary education

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.736
became essentially free.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.616
A massive expansion
of rural health centers

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.336
placed roughly 80 percent
of the population

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.536
less than a two-hour walk
from these facilities,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.336
a truly remarkable accomplishment.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.016
In 1980, the year of independence,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.216
25 percent of Zimbabwean children
were fully immunized.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.536
By 1990, a mere decade later,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.280
this proportion stood at 80 percent.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.096
I felt tremendously privileged
to be part of this transformation,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.576
a revolution.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.440
The excitement,
the camaraderie, was palpable.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.456
Working side by side
with brilliant Zimbabweans --

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.416
scientists, doctors, activists --

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.416
I felt connected not only
to an African independence movement,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.920
but to a global progressive
public health movement.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.016
But there were daunting challenges.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.616
Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case
in 1985, the year I arrived.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.416
I had taken care of a few patients
with AIDS in the early 1980s,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.960
when I did my medical training
at Harlem Hospital, but --

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.760
we had no idea
what lay in store for Africa.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.336
Infection rate stood at about
two percent in my early days there.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.176
These would soar

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.576
to one out of every four adults

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.040
by the time I left Harare 17 years later.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.216
By the mid-1990s,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.376
I'd told hundreds of people
in the prime of life

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.616
that they were HIV-positive.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.736
I saw colleagues and friends die,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.760
my students, hospital patients, die.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.136
In response, my colleagues and I
set up a clinic.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.696
We did condom demonstrations.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.136
We launched school education
and workplace interventions.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.736
We did research. We counseled
the partners of infected men

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.376
about how to protect themselves.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.936
We worked hard, and at the time,
I believed that I was doing my best.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.056
I was providing excellent treatment,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.280
such as it was.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.000
But I was not talking
about structural change.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.376
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan
has spoken candidly

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.456
about his personal failure

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.336
leading to the Rwandan genocide.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.416
In 1994, he was head
of the UN peacekeeping department.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.976
At a 10-year memorial for the genocide,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.056
he reflected, "I believed at the time
I was doing my best,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.976
but I realized after the genocide

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.960
that there was more
I could and should have done

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.240
to sound the alarm and rally support."

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.440
The AIDS epidemic caught
the health community unprepared,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.496
and today, when the World
Health Organization estimates

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.856
that 39 million people
have lost their lives to this disease,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.976
I'm not alone in feeling
remorse and regret

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.480
at not having done more earlier.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.016
But while living in Zimbabwe,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.736
I didn't see my role
as an advocacy or a political one.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.696
I was there for my technical skills,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.176
both my clinical and my research
epidemiology skills.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.176
And in my mind, my job
was to take care of patients

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.336
and to do research to better understand
the population patterns of transmission,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.080
and I hoped that we'd slow
the spread of the virus.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.696
I was aware that socially marginalized
populations were at disproportionate risk

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.736
of getting and dying of AIDS.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.816
And on the sugar plantations,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.616
which really more closely
resembled feudal fiefdoms

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.616
than any modern enterprise,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.296
60 percent of pregnant women

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.360
tested HIV-positive.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.176
I worked to show how getting infected
was not a moral failure

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.976
but instead related
to a culture of male superiority,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.536
to forced migrant labor
and to colonialism.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.360
Whites were largely unscathed.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.896
As health professionals,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.176
our tools were pitifully weak:

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.056
imploring people to change
their individual behaviors,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.936
use condoms, reduce number of partners.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.560
Infection rates climbed,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.176
and when treatment
became available in the West,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.616
treatment that remains
our most potent weapon

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.336
against this virus,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.736
it was unaffordable
to the public sector across Africa.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.000
I didn't speak out

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.176
about the unequal access
to these life-saving drugs

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.856
or about the underlying
economic and political systems

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.736
that were driving infection rates

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.960
in such huge swaths of the population.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.936
I rationalized my silence

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.896
by reminding myself
that I was a guest in the country,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.856
that sounding the alarm
could even get me kicked out,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.536
keep me from doing good work,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.056
taking care of my patients,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.840
doing much-needed research.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.896
So I didn't speak out

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.040
about the government's
early stance on AIDS.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.616
I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.816
Many doctors, health professionals,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.720
may think I did nothing wrong.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.536
Our pact with our patients,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.296
the Hippocratic Oath and its variants,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.280
is about the sanctity
of the patient-doctor relationship.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.680
And I did everything I could

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.240
for each and every patient of mine.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.376
But I knew

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.136
that epidemics emerge
along the fissures of our society,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.176
reflecting not only biology,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.816
but more importantly
patterns of marginalization, exclusion,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.000
discrimination related to race,
gender, sexuality, class and more.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.320
It was true of AIDS.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.520
It was true just recently of Ebola.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.416
Medical anthropologists
such as Paul Farmer,

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.376
who worked on AIDS in Haiti,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.800
call this structural violence:

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.536
structural because inequities are embedded

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.536
in the political and economic
organization of our social world,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.920
often in ways that are invisible
to those with privilege and power;

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.496
and violence because its impact --

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.960
premature deaths,
suffering, illness -- is violent.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.016
We do little for our patients

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.896
if we fail to recognize

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.856
these social injustices.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:23.216
Sounding the alarm is the first step
towards doing public health right,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.296
and it's how we may rally support

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.400
to break through
and create real change together.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.480
So these days, I'm not staying quiet.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.016
I'm speaking up about a lot of things,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.696
even when it makes listeners
uncomfortable,

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.640
even when it makes me uncomfortable.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.456
And a lot of this
is about racial disparities

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.440
and institutionalized racism,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.776
things that we're not supposed
to have in this country anymore,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.136
certainly not in the practice of medicine

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.376
or public health.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.600
But we have them,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.480
and we pay for them in lives cut short.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.976
That's why sounding the alarm

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.776
about the impact of racism on health
in the United States,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.096
the ongoing institutional
and interpersonal violence

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.096
that people of color face,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.456
compounded by our tragic legacy

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.400
of 250 years of slavery,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.240
90 years of Jim Crow

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.696
and 60 years of imperfect equality,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.096
sounding the alarm about this

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.456
is central to doing my job right

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.919
as New York City's Health Commissioner.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.376
In New York City, premature mortality --
that's death before the age of 65 --

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.176
is 50 percent higher
for black men than white ones.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.016
A black woman in 2012

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.776
faced more than 10 times
the risk of dying related to childbirth

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.120
as a white woman.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.896
And though we've made enormous strides

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.976
in reducing infant mortality rates,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.536
a black baby still faces

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.120
nearly three times the risk
of death in its first year of life

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.680
as compared to a white baby.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.760
New York City's not exceptional.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.096
These statistics are paralleled

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.320
by statistics found
across the United States.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.496
A recent New York Times analysis

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:40.320
reported that there are 1.5 million
missing black men across the country.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.720
They noted that more than one

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.896
out of every six black men

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.216
who today should be
between the ages of 25 and 54 years

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.160
have disappeared from daily life,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.560
lost either to prison or premature death.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.376
There is great injustice

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.376
in the daily and disproportionate violence
faced by young black men,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:12.480
the focus of recent protests
under the banner #BlackLivesMatter.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.736
But we have to remember

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.176
that enduring and disparate rates

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.136
and the occurrence and outcome
of common medical conditions --

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.296
heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV --

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.576
diseases that may kill slowly and quietly

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.840
and take even more
black lives prematurely.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.736
As the #BlackLivesMatter
movement unfolded,

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.296
I felt frustrated and angry

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.616
that the medical community

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.096
has been reluctant
to even use the word "racism"

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.816
in our research and our work.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.720
You've probably felt something
every time I've said it.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.776
Our medical students
held die-ins in their white coats,

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.816
but the medical community
has largely stood by passively

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.256
as ongoing discrimination
continues to affect

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.096
the disease profile and mortality.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.896
And I worry

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.456
that the trend towards personalized
and precision medicine,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.656
looking for biological or genetic targets
to better tailor treatment,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.696
may inadvertently cause us
to lose sight of the big picture,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.216
that it is the daily context,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.936
where a person lives, grows,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.416
works, loves,

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.336
that most importantly
determines population health,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.000
and for too many of us, poor health.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.280
As health professionals in our daily work,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.736
whether in the clinic or doing research,

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.280
we are witness to great injustice:

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.936
the homeless person
who is unable to follow medical advice

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.376
because he has more pressing priorities;

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.136
the transgender youth
who is contemplating suicide

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.776
because our society is just so harsh;

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.856
the single mother who has been made
to feel that she is responsible

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.440
for the poor health of her child.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.376
Our role as health professionals

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.560
is not just to treat our patients

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.720
but to sound the alarm

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.400
and advocate for change.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.576
Rightfully or not,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.576
our societal position
gives our voices great credibility,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.080
and we shouldn't waste that.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.040
I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe,

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.936
and I've promised myself

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.576
that as New York City's
Health Commissioner,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.896
I will use every opportunity I have

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.776
to sound the alarm

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.256
and rally support for health equity.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.056
I will speak out against racism,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.216
and I hope you will join me,

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.576
and I will join you
when you speak out against sexism

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.856
or any other form of inequality.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.296
It's time for us to rise up

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.016
and collectively speak up

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.600
about structural inequality.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.936
We don't have to have all the answers

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.560
to call for change.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.440
We just need courage.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.560
The health of our patients,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.160
the health of us all, depends on it.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.480
(Applause)
