WEBVTT

00:00:00.781 --> 00:00:02.337
I want to tell you the story

00:00:02.362 --> 00:00:06.119
about the time I almost got kidnapped

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:09.119
in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.

00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:13.105
It's the day after graduating
from design school

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.614
and I'm having a yard sale.

00:00:14.638 --> 00:00:17.331
And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:19.468
and he starts looking through my stuff.

00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:21.918
And he buys a piece of art that I made.

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:26.085
And it turns out he's alone
in town for the night,

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.662
driving cross-country on a road trip

00:00:28.686 --> 00:00:30.469
before he goes into the Peace Corps.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.496
So I invite him out for a beer

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:35.623
and he tells me all about his passion

00:00:35.647 --> 00:00:37.695
for making a difference in the world.

00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:40.086
Now it's starting to get late,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.067
and I'm getting pretty tired.

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:44.404
As I motion for the tab,

00:00:44.428 --> 00:00:46.575
I make the mistake of asking him,

00:00:47.493 --> 00:00:49.281
"So where are you staying tonight?"

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:52.114
And he makes it worse by saying,

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:54.718
"Actually, I don't have a place."

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:57.982
And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:00.212
What do you do?

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:02.284
We've all been there, right?

00:01:03.212 --> 00:01:04.848
Do I offer to host this guy?

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.483
But, I just met him -- I mean,

00:01:07.507 --> 00:01:09.333
he says he's going to the Peace Corps,

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:11.992
but I don't really know if he's going
to the Peace Corps

00:01:12.016 --> 00:01:14.896
and I don't want to end up kidnapped
in the trunk of a Miata.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.094
That's a small trunk!

00:01:18.062 --> 00:01:20.155
So then I hear myself saying,

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.203
"Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on
in my living room."

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.547
And the voice in my head goes,

00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:26.889
"Wait, what?"

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:30.515
That night, I'm laying in bed,

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.746
I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,

00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:36.477
"Oh my god, what have I done?

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:39.656
There's a complete stranger
sleeping in my living room.

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:42.315
What if he's psychotic?"

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:44.329
My anxiety grows so much,

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:46.213
I leap out of bed,

00:01:46.237 --> 00:01:48.930
I sneak on my tiptoes to the door,

00:01:48.954 --> 00:01:50.779
and I lock the bedroom door.

00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:54.168
It turns out he was not psychotic.

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:56.423
We've kept in touch ever since.

00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:58.737
And the piece of art
he bought at the yard sale

00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.250
is hanging in his classroom;
he's a teacher now.

00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:04.812
This was my first hosting experience,

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:07.720
and it completely changed my perspective.

00:02:09.198 --> 00:02:13.960
Maybe the people that my childhood
taught me to label as strangers

00:02:13.984 --> 00:02:16.440
were actually friends waiting
to be discovered.

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:21.487
The idea of hosting people on airbeds
gradually became natural to me

00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:23.170
and when I moved to San Francisco,

00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:24.789
I brought the airbed with me.

00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:26.742
So now it's two years later.

00:02:27.172 --> 00:02:30.051
I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,

00:02:30.075 --> 00:02:33.349
my roommate moves out,
and then the rent goes up.

00:02:34.248 --> 00:02:37.051
And then I learn there's a design
conference coming to town,

00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:38.866
and all the hotels are sold out.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.370
And I've always believed
that turning fear into fun

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:43.902
is the gift of creativity.

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:50.060
So here's what I pitch my best friend
and my new roommate Brian Chesky:

00:02:50.084 --> 00:02:52.384
"Brian, thought of a way
to make a few bucks --

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:54.891
turning our place into 'designers
bed and breakfast,'

00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:57.694
offering young designers who come
to town a place to crash,

00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:00.165
complete with wireless Internet,
a small desk space,

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.205
sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:03.400
Ha!"

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:08.074
We built a basic website
and Airbed and Breakfast was born.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.945
Three lucky guests got to stay

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.540
on a 20-dollar airbed
on the hardwood floor.

00:03:14.052 --> 00:03:16.524
But they loved it, and so did we.

00:03:17.024 --> 00:03:19.406
I swear, the ham
and Swiss cheese omelets we made

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.437
tasted totally different
because we made them for our guests.

00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:25.800
We took them on adventures
around the city,

00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:28.436
and when we said goodbye
to the last guest,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.943
the door latch clicked,

00:03:30.927 --> 00:03:32.927
Brian and I just stared at each other.

00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:37.270
Did we just discover
it was possible to make friends

00:03:37.294 --> 00:03:38.872
while also making rent?

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.999
The wheels had started to turn.

00:03:42.023 --> 00:03:43.674
My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,

00:03:43.698 --> 00:03:46.015
joined as engineering co-founder.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.619
And we buckled down to see

00:03:48.643 --> 00:03:50.546
if we could turn this into a business.

00:03:51.956 --> 00:03:53.686
Here's what we pitched investors:

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:57.814
"We want to build a website

00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:01.380
where people publicly post pictures
of their most intimate spaces,

00:04:01.404 --> 00:04:03.261
their bedrooms, the bathrooms --

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:06.711
the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed
when people come over.

00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:08.406
And then, over the Internet,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.863
they're going to invite complete strangers
to come sleep in their homes.

00:04:11.887 --> 00:04:13.292
It's going to be huge!"

00:04:13.316 --> 00:04:15.482
(Laughter)

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:18.763
We sat back, and we waited
for the rocket ship to blast off.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.098
It did not.

00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:25.506
No one in their right minds
would invest in a service

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.102
that allows strangers
to sleep in people's homes.

00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:29.278
Why?

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.220
Because we've all been taught
as kids, strangers equal danger.

00:04:34.038 --> 00:04:37.585
Now, when you're faced with a problem,
you fall back on what you know,

00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:39.379
and all we really knew was design.

00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:43.212
In art school, you learn
that design is much more

00:04:43.236 --> 00:04:46.449
than the look and feel of something --
it's the whole experience.

00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:48.532
We learned to do that for objects,

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:52.840
but here, we were aiming
to build Olympic trust

00:04:52.864 --> 00:04:54.674
between people who had never met.

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.242
Could design make that happen?

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.697
Is it possible to design for trust?

00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:06.802
I want to give you a sense
of the flavor of trust

00:05:06.826 --> 00:05:08.682
that we were aiming to achieve.

00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:11.122
I've got a 30-second experiment

00:05:11.146 --> 00:05:13.594
that will push you past your comfort zone.

00:05:13.618 --> 00:05:15.879
If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:21.654
OK, I need you to take out your phones.

00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:28.366
Now that you have your phone out,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.119
I'd like you to unlock your phone.

00:05:33.807 --> 00:05:37.624
Now hand your unlocked phone
to the person on your left.

00:05:37.648 --> 00:05:41.353
(Laughter)

00:05:49.734 --> 00:05:52.547
That tiny sense of panic
you're feeling right now --

00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:54.246
(Laughter)

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.600
is exactly how hosts feel the first time
they open their home.

00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:01.338
Because the only thing
more personal than your phone

00:06:01.362 --> 00:06:02.561
is your home.

00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:04.890
People don't just see your messages,

00:06:04.914 --> 00:06:06.173
they see your bedroom,

00:06:06.197 --> 00:06:07.787
your kitchen, your toilet.

00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:13.481
Now, how does it feel holding
someone's unlocked phone?

00:06:14.185 --> 00:06:15.933
Most of us feel really responsible.

00:06:17.017 --> 00:06:20.818
That's how most guests feel
when they stay in a home.

00:06:20.842 --> 00:06:23.785
And it's because of this
that our company can even exist.

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:27.094
By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?

00:06:27.118 --> 00:06:30.576
(Laughter)

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.197
Would you tell Twitter
he's running for President?

00:06:33.221 --> 00:06:35.222
(Laughter)

00:06:35.246 --> 00:06:37.784
(Applause)

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:45.977
OK, you can hand your phones back now.

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:54.840
So now that you've experienced
the kind of trust challenge

00:06:54.864 --> 00:06:56.104
we were facing,

00:06:56.128 --> 00:06:59.257
I'd love to share a few discoveries
we've made along the way.

00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:02.270
What if we changed one small thing

00:07:02.294 --> 00:07:04.338
about the design of that experiment?

00:07:04.362 --> 00:07:08.145
What if your neighbor had introduced
themselves first, with their name,

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.034
where they're from, the name
of their kids or their dog?

00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:15.217
Imagine that they had 150 reviews
of people saying,

00:07:15.241 --> 00:07:17.646
"They're great at holding
unlocked phones!"

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.527
(Laughter)

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:25.906
Now how would you feel
about handing your phone over?

00:07:27.784 --> 00:07:28.936
It turns out,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.412
a well-designed reputation system
is key for building trust.

00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:35.961
And we didn't actually
get it right the first time.

00:07:35.985 --> 00:07:38.730
It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.

00:07:39.447 --> 00:07:43.833
Eventually, we learned to wait
until both guests and hosts

00:07:43.857 --> 00:07:45.961
left the review before we reveal them.

00:07:47.107 --> 00:07:50.199
Now, here's a discovery
we made just last week.

00:07:50.984 --> 00:07:52.888
We did a joint study with Stanford,

00:07:52.912 --> 00:07:55.906
where we looked at people's
willingness to trust someone

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.396
based on how similar they are in age,
location and geography.

00:08:01.467 --> 00:08:04.427
The research showed, not surprisingly,

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:06.395
we prefer people who are like us.

00:08:08.094 --> 00:08:10.929
The more different somebody is,

00:08:10.953 --> 00:08:12.280
the less we trust them.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.153
Now, that's a natural social bias.

00:08:16.532 --> 00:08:18.886
But what's interesting is what happens

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.868
when you add reputation into the mix,

00:08:20.892 --> 00:08:22.732
in this case, with reviews.

00:08:23.398 --> 00:08:25.415
Now, if you've got
less than three reviews,

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.819
nothing changes.

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:29.646
But if you've got more than 10,

00:08:30.527 --> 00:08:32.443
everything changes.

00:08:32.467 --> 00:08:36.695
High reputation beats high similarity.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.029
The right design can actually
help us overcome

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:43.235
one of our most deeply rooted biases.

00:08:45.247 --> 00:08:48.355
Now we also learned that building
the right amount of trust

00:08:48.379 --> 00:08:50.632
takes the right amount of disclosure.

00:08:51.275 --> 00:08:54.537
This is what happens when a guest
first messages a host.

00:08:55.862 --> 00:08:59.752
If you share too little, like, "Yo,"

00:09:00.886 --> 00:09:02.483
acceptance rates go down.

00:09:02.507 --> 00:09:04.624
And if you share too much, like,

00:09:04.648 --> 00:09:06.341
"I'm having issues with my mother,"

00:09:06.365 --> 00:09:07.515
(Laughter)

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:09.531
acceptance rates also go down.

00:09:10.372 --> 00:09:12.317
But there's a zone that's just right,

00:09:12.341 --> 00:09:16.639
like, "Love the artwork in your place.
Coming for vacation with my family."

00:09:16.663 --> 00:09:19.972
So how do we design for just
the right amount of disclosure?

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.115
We use the size of the box
to suggest the right length,

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:27.377
and we guide them with prompts
to encourage sharing.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.256
We bet our whole company

00:09:32.145 --> 00:09:33.789
on the hope that,

00:09:33.813 --> 00:09:35.696
with the right design,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.989
people would be willing to overcome
the stranger-danger bias.

00:09:39.918 --> 00:09:41.300
What we didn't realize

00:09:41.324 --> 00:09:43.758
is just how many people

00:09:43.782 --> 00:09:46.157
were ready and waiting
to put the bias aside.

00:09:47.823 --> 00:09:50.574
This is a graph that shows
our rate of adoption.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.455
There's three things happening here.

00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:57.796
The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.

00:09:58.841 --> 00:10:00.961
The second is the efforts of our team.

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:05.582
And third is the existence
of a previously unsatisfied need.

00:10:07.099 --> 00:10:09.476
Now, things have been going pretty well.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.292
Obviously, there are times
when things don't work out.

00:10:13.647 --> 00:10:15.611
Guests have thrown unauthorized parties

00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:16.904
and trashed homes.

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:20.784
Hosts have left guests
stranded in the rain.

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:25.625
In the early days, I was customer service,

00:10:26.213 --> 00:10:28.506
and those calls came
right to my cell phone.

00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:32.392
I was at the front lines
of trust breaking.

00:10:33.496 --> 00:10:36.044
And there's nothing worse
than those calls,

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:38.297
it hurts to even think about them.

00:10:39.113 --> 00:10:41.806
And the disappointment
in the sound of someone's voice

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.569
was and, I would say, still is

00:10:44.593 --> 00:10:47.033
our single greatest motivator
to keep improving.

00:10:48.073 --> 00:10:53.185
Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights
we've ever hosted,

00:10:53.932 --> 00:10:57.272
less than a fraction of a percent
have been problematic.

00:10:58.447 --> 00:11:00.776
Turns out, people
are justified in their trust.

00:11:01.705 --> 00:11:03.927
And when trust works out right,

00:11:03.951 --> 00:11:06.251
it can be absolutely magical.

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:10.087
We had a guest stay
with a host in Uruguay,

00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:11.719
and he suffered a heart attack.

00:11:12.274 --> 00:11:14.267
The host rushed him to the hospital.

00:11:15.354 --> 00:11:18.288
They donated their own blood
for his operation.

00:11:19.342 --> 00:11:21.892
Let me read you his review.

00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:24.252
(Laughter)

00:11:29.053 --> 00:11:31.332
"Excellent house for sedentary travelers

00:11:31.356 --> 00:11:33.599
prone to myocardial infarctions.

00:11:33.623 --> 00:11:35.868
(Laughter)

00:11:36.557 --> 00:11:40.504
The area is beautiful and has
direct access to the best hospitals.

00:11:40.528 --> 00:11:42.012
(Laughter)

00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:45.565
Javier and Alejandra instantly
become guardian angels

00:11:45.589 --> 00:11:48.295
who will save your life
without even knowing you.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.082
They will rush you to the hospital
in their own car while you're dying

00:11:53.106 --> 00:11:56.413
and stay in the waiting room
while the doctors give you a bypass.

00:11:57.268 --> 00:12:00.554
They don't want you to feel lonely,
they bring you books to read.

00:12:00.578 --> 00:12:04.605
And they let you stay at their house
extra nights without charging you.

00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:05.859
Highly recommended!"

00:12:05.883 --> 00:12:08.336
(Applause)

00:12:14.342 --> 00:12:16.591
Of course, not every stay is like that.

00:12:17.089 --> 00:12:19.787
But this connection beyond the transaction

00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:22.572
is exactly what the sharing
economy is aiming for.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.809
Now, when I heard that term,

00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:28.759
I have to admit, it tripped me up.

00:12:28.783 --> 00:12:31.306
How do sharing
and transactions go together?

00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:34.960
So let's be clear; it is about commerce.

00:12:35.832 --> 00:12:38.156
But if you just called it
the rental economy,

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.777
it would be incomplete.

00:12:40.576 --> 00:12:44.905
The sharing economy is commerce
with the promise of human connection.

00:12:45.612 --> 00:12:47.473
People share a part of themselves,

00:12:48.513 --> 00:12:50.158
and that changes everything.

00:12:51.428 --> 00:12:53.853
You know how most travel today is, like,

00:12:53.877 --> 00:12:55.608
I think of it like fast food --

00:12:55.632 --> 00:12:57.643
it's efficient and consistent,

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:01.623
at the cost of local and authentic.

00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:05.740
What if travel were like
a magnificent buffet

00:13:05.764 --> 00:13:07.413
of local experiences?

00:13:07.437 --> 00:13:09.733
What if anywhere you visited,

00:13:10.392 --> 00:13:12.637
there was a central marketplace of locals

00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:15.303
offering to get you thoroughly drunk

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:19.252
on a pub crawl in neighborhoods
you didn't even know existed.

00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:24.003
Or learning to cook from the chef
of a five-star restaurant?

00:13:25.082 --> 00:13:29.746
Today, homes are designed around
the idea of privacy and separation.

00:13:30.246 --> 00:13:33.703
What if homes were designed
to be shared from the ground up?

00:13:34.433 --> 00:13:35.787
What would that look like?

00:13:37.673 --> 00:13:40.401
What if cities embraced
a culture of sharing?

00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:46.510
I see a future of shared cities
that bring us community and connection

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.745
instead of isolation and separation.

00:13:49.878 --> 00:13:51.859
In South Korea, in the city of Seoul,

00:13:51.883 --> 00:13:53.566
they've actually even started this.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.466
They've repurposed hundreds
of government parking spots

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.934
to be shared by residents.

00:13:58.866 --> 00:14:01.463
They're connecting students
who need a place to live

00:14:01.487 --> 00:14:03.855
with empty-nesters who have extra rooms.

00:14:04.918 --> 00:14:08.582
And they've started an incubator
to help fund the next generation

00:14:08.606 --> 00:14:10.297
of sharing economy start-ups.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.176
Tonight, just on our service,

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.544
785,000 people

00:14:21.803 --> 00:14:24.583
in 191 countries

00:14:26.976 --> 00:14:29.257
will either stay in a stranger's home

00:14:30.154 --> 00:14:32.228
or welcome one into theirs.

00:14:34.014 --> 00:14:36.913
Clearly, it's not as crazy
as we were taught.

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:40.783
We didn't invent anything new.

00:14:41.568 --> 00:14:43.853
Hospitality has been around forever.

00:14:46.568 --> 00:14:49.698
There's been many other
websites like ours.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.327
So, why did ours eventually take off?

00:14:56.513 --> 00:14:58.319
Luck and timing aside,

00:14:59.311 --> 00:15:01.933
I've learned that you can take
the components of trust,

00:15:01.957 --> 00:15:03.522
and you can design for that.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.371
Design can overcome our most deeply rooted

00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:11.974
stranger-danger bias.

00:15:11.998 --> 00:15:13.759
And that's amazing to me.

00:15:14.304 --> 00:15:15.805
It blows my mind.

00:15:17.184 --> 00:15:19.762
I think about this every time
I see a red Miata go by.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.688
Now, we know design won't solve
all the world's problems.

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.294
But if it can help out with this one,

00:15:30.318 --> 00:15:31.907
if it can make a dent in this,

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:37.745
it makes me wonder,
what else can we design for next?

00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:41.492
Thank you.

00:15:41.516 --> 00:15:47.142
(Applause)
