00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.695
So a few years ago,

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.656
I did something really brave,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.360
or some would say really stupid.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.160
I ran for Congress.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.776
For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.856
as a fundraiser, as an organizer,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.080
but in my heart, I always wanted to run.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.136
The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.056
She had never lost a race,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.960
and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.536
But in my mind, this was my way

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.056
to make a difference,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.200
to disrupt the status quo.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.320
The polls, however,
told a very different story.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.136
My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.080
that there was no way that I could win.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.096
But I ran anyway,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.296
and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.400
I swore I was going to win.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.616
I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.976
the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.600
and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.696
I raised money from everyone I knew,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.616
including Indian aunties

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.360
that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.416
But on election day, the polls were right,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.480
and I only got 19 percent of the vote,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.656
and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.096
now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.136
on 6,321 votes.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.440
Don't do the math.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.480
It was humiliating.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.976
Now, before you get the wrong idea,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.440
this is not a talk
about the importance of failure.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.680
Nor is it about leaning in.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.616
I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.096
because I was 33 years old

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.856
and it was the first time
in my entire life

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.536
that I had done something
that was truly brave,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.240
where I didn't worry about being perfect.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.096
And I'm not alone:

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.856
so many women I talk to tell me

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.776
that they gravitate
towards careers and professions

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.896
that they know
they're going to be great in,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.296
that they know they're
going to be perfect in,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.136
and it's no wonder why.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.216
Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.016
We're taught to smile pretty,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.560
play it safe, get all A's.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.016
Boys, on the other hand,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.816
are taught to play rough, swing high,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.600
crawl to the top of the monkey bars
and then just jump off headfirst.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.776
And by the time they're adults,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.576
whether they're negotiating a raise
or even asking someone out on a date,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.496
they're habituated
to take risk after risk.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.760
They're rewarded for it.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.856
It's often said in Silicon Valley,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.160
no one even takes you seriously
unless you've had two failed start-ups.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.416
In other words,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.536
we're raising our girls to be perfect,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.880
and we're raising our boys to be brave.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.760
Some people worry
about our federal deficit,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.600
but I, I worry about our bravery deficit.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.696
Our economy, our society,
we're just losing out

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.240
because we're not raising
our girls to be brave.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.296
The bravery deficit is why
women are underrepresented in STEM,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.256
in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.840
and pretty much everywhere you look.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.176
In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.856
looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.480
that was too difficult for them.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.176
She found that bright girls
were quick to give up.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.920
The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.256
Bright boys, on the other hand,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.976
found the difficult material
to be a challenge.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.736
They found it energizing.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.960
They were more likely
to redouble their efforts.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.920
What's going on?

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.016
Well, at the fifth grade level,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.696
girls routinely outperform boys
in every subject,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.856
including math and science,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.720
so it's not a question of ability.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.680
The difference is in how boys
and girls approach a challenge.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.279
And it doesn't just end in fifth grade.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.976
An HP report found
that men will apply for a job

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.640
if they meet only 60 percent
of the qualifications,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.736
but women, women will apply

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.336
only if they meet 100 percent
of the qualifications.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.640
100 percent.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.056
This study is usually invoked
as evidence that, well,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.800
women need a little more confidence.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.856
But I think it's evidence

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.016
that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.576
and they're overly cautious.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.416
(Applause)

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.496
And even when we're ambitious,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.296
even when we're leaning in,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.536
that socialization of perfection

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.640
has caused us to take
less risks in our careers.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.896
And so those 600,000 jobs
that are open right now

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.160
in computing and tech,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.696
women are being left behind,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.376
and it means our economy
is being left behind

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.576
on all the innovation and problems
women would solve

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.336
if they were socialized to be brave

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.440
instead of socialized to be perfect.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.896
(Applause)

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.256
So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.336
and what I found
is that by teaching them to code

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.520
I had socialized them to be brave.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.456
Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.656
of trying to get the right command
in the right place,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.096
with sometimes just a semicolon

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.440
making the difference
between success and failure.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.336
Code breaks and then it falls apart,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.776
and it often takes many, many tries

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.096
until that magical moment

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.200
when what you're trying
to build comes to life.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.240
It requires perseverance.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.360
It requires imperfection.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.536
We immediately see in our program

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.896
our girls' fear of not getting it right,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.160
of not being perfect.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.016
Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.016
During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.016
a student will call her over
and she'll say,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.056
"I don't know what code to write."

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.016
The teacher will look at her screen,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.920
and she'll see a blank text editor.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.456
If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.560
spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.576
But if she presses undo a few times,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.320
she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.096
She tried, she came close,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.200
but she didn't get it exactly right.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.656
Instead of showing
the progress that she made,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.640
she'd rather show nothing at all.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.000
Perfection or bust.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.200
It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.031
but it's not enough
just to teach them to code.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.911
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia

00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:15.696
and teaches intro to Java

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.400
tells me about his office hours
with computer science students.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.376
When the guys are struggling
with an assignment,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.976
they'll come in and they'll say,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.360
"Professor, there's something
wrong with my code."

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.376
The girls will come in and say,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.440
"Professor, there's something
wrong with me."

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.816
We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection,

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.456
but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.320
that lets girls know
that they are not alone.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.040
Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.936
I can't tell you how many women tell me,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.736
"I'm afraid to raise my hand,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.896
I'm afraid to ask a question,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.296
because I don't want to be the only one

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.760
who doesn't understand,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.040
the only one who is struggling.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.736
When we teach girls to be brave

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.056
and we have a supportive network
cheering them on,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.096
they will build incredible things,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.840
and I see this every day.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.136
Take, for instance,
two of our high school students

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.536
who built a game called Tampon Run --

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.016
yes, Tampon Run --

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.456
to fight against the menstruation taboo

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.680
and sexism in gaming.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.416
Or the Syrian refugee

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.960
who dared show her love
for her new country

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.799
by building an app
to help Americans get to the polls.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.015
Or a 16-year-old girl
who built an algorithm

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:48.096
to help detect whether a cancer
is benign or malignant

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.496
in the off chance
that she can save her daddy's life

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.080
because he has cancer.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.400
These are just
three examples of thousands,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.216
thousands of girls who have been
socialized to be imperfect,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.193
who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance.

00:09:07.217 --> 00:09:09.216
And whether they become coders

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.896
or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.240
they will not defer their dreams.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.440
And those dreams have never been
more important for our country.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.456
For the American economy,
for any economy to grow,

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.616
to truly innovate,

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.840
we cannot leave behind
half our population.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.336
We have to socialize our girls
to be comfortable with imperfection,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.280
and we've got to do it now.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.616
We cannot wait for them
to learn how to be brave like I did

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.720
when I was 33 years old.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.576
We have to teach them
to be brave in schools

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.336
and early in their careers,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.496
when it has the most potential
to impact their lives

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.536
and the lives of others,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.336
and we have to show them
that they will be loved and accepted

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.416
not for being perfect

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.080
but for being courageous.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.656
And so I need each of you
to tell every young woman you know --

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.096
your sister, your niece,
your employee, your colleague --

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.680
to be comfortable with imperfection,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.856
because when we teach
girls to be imperfect,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.456
and we help them leverage it,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.376
we will build a movement
of young women who are brave

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.776
and who will build
a better world for themselves

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.440
and for each and every one of us.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.376
Thank you.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.320
(Applause)

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.280
Thank you.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.976
Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.680
It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.416
Tell me how it's going.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.696
How many girls
are involved now in your program?

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.376
Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
So in 2012, we taught 20 girls.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.936
This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.216
(Applause)

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.296
And that number is really powerful,

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.616
because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.216
Like, the problem is so bad

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.720
that we can make
that type of change quickly.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.816
CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.016
who are welcoming
graduates from your program?

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.016
RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.096
from Twitter to Facebook

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.616
to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney,

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.536
I mean, every single company out there.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.976
And if you're not signed up,
I'm going to find you,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.976
because we need every single tech company

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.776
to embed a Girls Who Code
classroom in their office.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.776
CA: And you have some stories
back from some of those companies

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.705
that when you mix in more gender balance

00:11:46.729 --> 00:11:50.176
in the engineering teams,
good things happen.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.496
RS: Great things happen.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.936
I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
to think about the fact

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.816
that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.896
Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.336
We own the Internet,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.816
and we should be building
the companies of tomorrow.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.016
And I think when companies
have diverse teams,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.456
and they have incredible women
that are part of their engineering teams,

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.896
they build awesome things,
and we see it every day.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.656
CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
You're doing incredibly important work.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.976
This whole community is cheering you on.
More power to you. Thank you.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.216
RS: Thank you.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.080
(Applause)
