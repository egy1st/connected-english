WEBVTT

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.256
There are times when I feel
really quite ashamed

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.520
to be a European.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.055
In the last year,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.656
more than a million people
arrived in Europe in need of our help,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.960
and our response,
frankly, has been pathetic.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.320
There are just so many contradictions.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.816
We mourn the tragic death

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.000
of two-year-old Alan Kurdi,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.856
and yet, since then,
more than 200 children

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240
have subsequently drowned
in the Mediterranean.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.416
We have international treaties

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.656
that recognize that refugees
are a shared responsibility,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.736
and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.400
hosts more Syrians
than the whole of Europe combined.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.720
We lament the existence
of human smugglers,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.776
and yet we make that the only viable route

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.880
to seek asylum in Europe.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.696
We have labor shortages,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.176
and yet we exclude people who fit
our economic and demographic needs

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.040
from coming to Europe.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.936
We proclaim our liberal values
in opposition to fundamentalist Islam,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.160
and yet --

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.216
we have repressive policies

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.560
that detain child asylum seekers,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.960
that separate children
from their families,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.720
and that seize property from refugees.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.200
What are we doing?

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.056
How has the situation come to this,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.880
that we've adopted such an inhumane
response to a humanitarian crisis?

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.696
I don't believe
it's because people don't care,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.896
or at least I don't want to believe
it's because people don't care.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.736
I believe it's because
our politicians lack a vision,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.376
a vision for how to adapt
an international refugee system

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.536
created over 50 years ago

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.360
for a changing and globalized world.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.336
And so what I want to do
is take a step back

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.776
and ask two really fundamental questions,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.256
the two questions we all need to ask.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.576
First, why is the current
system not working?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.000
And second, what can we do to fix it?

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.816
So the modern refugee regime

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.920
was created in the aftermath
of the Second World War by these guys.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.136
Its basic aim is to ensure

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.376
that when a state fails,
or worse, turns against its own people,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.976
people have somewhere to go,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.656
to live in safety and dignity
until they can go home.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.960
It was created precisely for situations
like the situation we see in Syria today.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.536
Through an international convention
signed by 147 governments,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.576
the 1951 Convention
on the Status of Refugees,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.776
and an international organization, UNHCR,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.576
states committed to reciprocally
admit people onto their territory

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.120
who flee conflict and persecution.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.280
But today, that system is failing.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.360
In theory, refugees
have a right to seek asylum.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.840
In practice, our immigration policies
block the path to safety.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.616
In theory, refugees have a right
to a pathway to integration,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.680
or return to the country
they've come from.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.600
But in practice, they get stuck
in almost indefinite limbo.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.320
In theory, refugees
are a shared global responsibility.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.376
In practice, geography means
that countries proximate the conflict

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.000
take the overwhelming majority
of the world's refugees.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.456
The system isn't broken
because the rules are wrong.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.400
It's that we're not applying them
adequately to a changing world,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.840
and that's what we need to reconsider.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.936
So I want to explain to you a little bit
about how the current system works.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.120
How does the refugee regime actually work?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.336
But not from a top-down
institutional perspective,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.680
rather from the perspective of a refugee.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.696
So imagine a Syrian woman.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.320
Let's call her Amira.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.760
And Amira to me represents
many of the people I've met in the region.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.896
Amira, like around 25 percent
of the world's refugees,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.200
is a woman with children,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.096
and she can't go home
because she comes from this city

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.136
that you see before you, Homs,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.896
a once beautiful and historic city

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.416
now under rubble.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.280
And so Amira can't go back there.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.336
But Amira also has no hope
of resettlement to a third country,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.856
because that's a lottery ticket

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.320
only available to less than one percent
of the world's refugees.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.136
So Amira and her family

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.336
face an almost impossible choice.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.760
They have three basic options.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.520
The first option is that Amira
can take her family to a camp.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.680
In the camp, she might get assistance,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.856
but there are very few prospects
for Amira and her family.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.136
Camps are in bleak, arid locations,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.400
often in the desert.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.736
In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.160
you can hear the shells
across the border in Syria at nighttime.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.176
There's restricted economic activity.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.360
Education is often of poor quality.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.296
And around the world,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.416
some 80 percent of refugees
who are in camps

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.976
have to stay for at least five years.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.896
It's a miserable existence,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.296
and that's probably why, in reality,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.920
only nine percent of Syrians
choose that option.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.976
Alternatively, Amira can head
to an urban area

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.040
in a neighboring country,
like Amman or Beirut.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.040
That's an option that about 75 percent
of Syrian refugees have taken.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.920
But there, there's
great difficulty as well.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.016
Refugees in such urban areas
don't usually have the right to work.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.000
They don't usually get
significant access to assistance.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.136
And so when Amira and her family
have used up their basic savings,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.840
they're left with very little
and likely to face urban destitution.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.120
So there's a third alternative,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.640
and it's one that increasing
numbers of Syrians are taking.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.016
Amira can seek some hope for her family

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.776
by risking their lives
on a dangerous and perilous journey

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.296
to another country,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.840
and it's that which we're seeing
in Europe today.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.696
Around the world, we present refugees
with an almost impossible choice

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.536
between three options:

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.760
encampment, urban destitution
and dangerous journeys.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.840
For refugees, that choice is
the global refugee regime today.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.240
But I think it's a false choice.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.840
I think we can reconsider that choice.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.800
The reason why we limit those options

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.520
is because we think

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.456
that those are the only options
that are available to refugees,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.680
and they're not.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.616
Politicians frame the issue
as a zero-sum issue,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.576
that if we benefit refugees,
we're imposing costs on citizens.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.656
We tend to have a collective assumption

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.336
that refugees are an inevitable cost
or burden to society.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.440
But they don't have to.
They can contribute.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.296
So what I want to argue

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.296
is there are ways in which we can
expand that choice set

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.336
and still benefit everyone else:

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.216
the host states and communities,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.560
our societies and refugees themselves.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.056
And I want to suggest four ways

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.920
we can transform the paradigm
of how we think about refugees.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.960
All four ways have one thing in common:

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.216
they're all ways in which we take
the opportunities of globalization,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.296
mobility and markets,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.560
and update the way we think
about the refugee issue.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.976
The first one I want to think about

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
is the idea of enabling environments,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.576
and it starts from
a very basic recognition

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.296
that refugees are human beings
like everyone else,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.720
but they're just
in extraordinary circumstances.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.256
Together with my colleagues in Oxford,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.936
we've embarked on
a research project in Uganda

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.000
looking at the economic lives of refugees.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.896
We chose Uganda not because
it's representative of all host countries.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.400
It's not. It's exceptional.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.336
Unlike most host countries
around the world,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.816
what Uganda has done

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.216
is give refugees economic opportunity.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.600
It gives them the right to work.
It gives them freedom of movement.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.096
And the results of that are extraordinary

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.720
both for refugees and the host community.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.456
In the capital city, Kampala,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.895
we found that 21 percent of refugees
own a business that employs other people,

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.376
and 40 percent of those employees

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.376
are nationals of the host country.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.576
In other words, refugees are making jobs

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.240
for citizens of the host country.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.256
Even in the camps,
we found extraordinary examples

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.840
of vibrant, flourishing
and entrepreneurial businesses.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.136
For example, in a settlement
called Nakivale,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.136
we found examples of Congolese refugees

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.696
running digital music exchange businesses.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.496
We found a Rwandan
who runs a business that's available

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.256
to allow the youth to play computer games

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.040
on recycled games consoles
and recycled televisions.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.256
Against the odds of extreme constraint,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.600
refugees are innovating,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.749
and the gentleman you see before you
is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.856
Demou-Kay arrived
in the settlement with very little,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.176
but he wanted to be a filmmaker.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.136
So with friends and colleagues,
he started a community radio station,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.896
he rented a video camera,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.416
and he's now making films.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.416
He made two documentary films

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.416
with and for our team,

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.760
and he's making a successful business
out of very little.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.616
It's those kinds of examples

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.376
that should guide
our response to refugees.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.736
Rather than seeing refugees

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.016
as inevitably dependent
upon humanitarian assistance,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.440
we need to provide them
with opportunities for human flourishing.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.426
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food

00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:07.216
are all important in the emergency phase,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.840
but we need to also look beyond that.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.536
We need to provide opportunities
to connectivity, electricity,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.840
education, the right to work,

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.120
access to capital and banking.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.696
All the ways in which we take for granted

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.856
that we are plugged in
to the global economy

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.440
can and should apply to refugees.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.760
The second idea I want to discuss
is economic zones.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.056
Unfortunately, not every
host country in the world

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.120
takes the approach Uganda has taken.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.816
Most host countries don't open up
their economies to refugees

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.040
in the same way.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.960
But there are still pragmatic
alternative options that we can use.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.696
Last April, I traveled to Jordan
with my colleague,

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.680
the development economist Paul Collier,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.256
and we brainstormed an idea
while we were there

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.736
with the international community
and the government,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.096
an idea to bring jobs to Syrians

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.736
while supporting Jordan's
national development strategy.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.560
The idea is for an economic zone,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.616
one in which we could potentially
integrate the employment of refugees

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.120
alongside the employment
of Jordanian host nationals.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.256
And just 15 minutes away
from the Zaatari refugee camp,

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.416
home to 83,000 refugees,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.456
is an existing economic zone

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.200
called the King Hussein
Bin Talal Development Area.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.696
The government has spent
over a hundred million dollars

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.536
connecting it to the electricity grid,
connecting it to the road network,

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.176
but it lacked two things:

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.936
access to labor and inward investment.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.856
So what if refugees
were able to work there

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.696
rather than being stuck in camps,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.736
able to support their families and develop
skills through vocational training

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.200
before they go back to Syria?

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.136
We recognized that
that could benefit Jordan,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.936
whose development strategy
requires it to make the leap

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.776
as a middle income country
to manufacturing.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.496
It could benefit refugees,
but it could also contribute

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.896
to the postconflict
reconstruction of Syria

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.696
by recognizing that we need
to incubate refugees

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.280
as the best source
of eventually rebuilding Syria.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.816
We published the idea
in the journal Foreign Affairs.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.056
King Abdullah has picked up on the idea.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.056
It was announced at the London
Syria Conference two weeks ago,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.680
and a pilot will begin in the summer.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.720
(Applause)

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.816
The third idea that I want to put to you

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.456
is preference matching
between states and refugees

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.616
to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes
you see here in the selfie

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.520
featuring Angela Merkel
and a Syrian refugee.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.440
What we rarely do is ask refugees
what they want, where they want to go,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.816
but I'd argue we can do that

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.920
and still make everyone better off.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.776
The economist Alvin Roth has developed
the idea of matching markets,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.040
ways in which the preference ranking
of the parties shapes an eventual match.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.776
My colleagues Will Jones
and Alex Teytelboym

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.936
have explored ways in which that idea
could be applied to refugees,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.496
to ask refugees to rank
their preferred destinations,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.296
but also allow states to rank
the types of refugees they want

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.136
on skills criteria or language criteria

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.856
and allow those to match.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.976
Now, of course
you'd need to build in quotas

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.256
on things like diversity
and vulnerability,

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.816
but it's a way of increasing
the possibilities of matching.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.336
The matching idea
has been successfully used

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.496
to match, for instance,
students with university places,

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.016
to match kidney donors with patients,

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.176
and it underlies the kind of algorithms
that exist on dating websites.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.296
So why not apply that
to give refugees greater choice?

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.368
It could also be used
at the national level,

00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:47.376
where one of the great challenges we face

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.136
is to persuade local communities
to accept refugees.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.616
And at the moment,
in my country, for instance,

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.816
we often send engineers to rural areas
and farmers to the cities,

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.696
which makes no sense at all.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.296
So matching markets offer a potential way
to bring those preferences together

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.256
and listen to the needs and demands
of the populations that host

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.120
and the refugees themselves.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.560
The fourth idea I want to put to you
is of humanitarian visas.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.936
Much of the tragedy and chaos
we've seen in Europe

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.960
was entirely avoidable.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.496
It stems from a fundamental contradiction
in Europe's asylum policy,

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.896
which is the following:

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.416
that in order to seek asylum in Europe,

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.456
you have to arrive spontaneously
by embarking on those dangerous journeys

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.680
that I described.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.256
But why should those journeys be necessary
in an era of the budget airline

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.696
and modern consular capabilities?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.056
They're completely unnecessary journeys,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.856
and last year, they led to the deaths
of over 3,000 people

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.360
on Europe's borders
and within European territory.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.976
If refugees were simply allowed

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.776
to travel directly
and seek asylum in Europe,

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.096
we would avoid that,

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.656
and there's a way of doing that

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.976
through something
called a humanitarian visa,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.536
that allows people
to collect a visa at an embassy

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.696
or a consulate in a neighboring country

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.616
and then simply pay their own way

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.200
through a ferry or a flight to Europe.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.976
It costs around a thousand euros

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.416
to take a smuggler
from Turkey to the Greek islands.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.896
It costs 200 euros to take a budget
airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.696
If we allowed refugees to do that,
it would have major advantages.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.000
It would save lives,

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.696
it would undercut
the entire market for smugglers,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.056
and it would remove the chaos
we see from Europe's front line

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.136
in areas like the Greek islands.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.400
It's politics that prevents us doing that
rather than a rational solution.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.216
And this is an idea that has been applied.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.896
Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.216
where over 2,000 Syrians
have been able to get humanitarian visas,

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.616
enter Brazil, and claim refugee status
on arrival in Brazil.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.536
And in that scheme,
every Syrian who has gone through it

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.520
has received refugee status
and been recognized as a genuine refugee.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.400
There is a historical precedent
for it as well.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.256
Between 1922 and 1942,

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.056
these Nansen passports
were used as travel documents

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:21.616
to allow 450,000 Assyrians,
Turks and Chechens

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.136
to travel across Europe

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.920
and claim refugee status
elsewhere in Europe.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.256
And the Nansen
International Refugee Office

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.136
received the Nobel Peace Prize

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.120
in recognition of this
being a viable strategy.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.216
So all four of these ideas
that I've presented you

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.560
are ways in which we can expand
Amira's choice set.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.176
They're ways in which we can have
greater choice for refugees

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.016
beyond those basic,
impossible three options

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.256
I explained to you

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.360
and still leave others better off.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.336
In conclusion,
we really need a new vision,

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.136
a vision that enlarges
the choices of refugees

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.696
but recognizes that they
don't have to be a burden.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.175
There's nothing inevitable
about refugees being a cost.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.455
Yes, they are a humanitarian
responsibility,

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.096
but they're human beings
with skills, talents, aspirations,

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.800
with the ability to make
contributions -- if we let them.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.760
In the new world,

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.576
migration is not going to go away.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.576
What we've seen in Europe
will be with us for many years.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.415
People will continue to travel,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.296
they'll continue to be displaced,

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:30.816
and we need to find rational,
realistic ways of managing this --

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.856
not based on the old logics
of humanitarian assistance,

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.976
not based on logics of charity,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.616
but building on the opportunities

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.016
offered by globalization,
markets and mobility.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.456
I'd urge you all to wake up
and urge our politicians

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.336
to wake up to this challenge.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.616
Thank you very much.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:56.524
(Applause)
