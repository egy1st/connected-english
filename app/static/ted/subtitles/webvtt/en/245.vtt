00:00:01.278 --> 00:00:05.499
So, as researchers, something
that we often do is use immense resources

00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:08.802
to achieve certain capabilities,
or achieve certain goals.

00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:11.361
And this is essential
to the progress of science,

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:13.710
or exploration of what is possible.

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:15.742
But it creates this unfortunate situation

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.782
where a tiny, tiny fraction of the world

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:19.902
can actually participate
in this exploration

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:21.747
or can benefit from that technology.

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.176
Something that motivates me,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.413
and gets me really excited
about my research,

00:00:25.437 --> 00:00:27.143
is when I see simple opportunities

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:30.967
to drastically change that distribution
and make the technology accessible

00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:33.100
to a much wider percentage
of the population.

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:36.656
I'm going to show you two videos
that have gotten a lot of attention

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.450
that I think embody this philosophy.

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:40.907
And they actually use
the Nintendo Wii Remote.

00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:43.472
For those of you who aren't
familiar with this device,

00:00:43.496 --> 00:00:46.193
it's a $40 video game controller.

00:00:46.217 --> 00:00:49.362
And it's mostly advertised
for its motion-sensing capabilities:

00:00:49.386 --> 00:00:52.028
so you can swing a tennis racket,
or hit a baseball bat.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.410
But what actually interests me a lot more

00:00:54.434 --> 00:00:56.592
is the fact that in the tip
of each controller

00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:59.406
is a relatively high-performing
infrared camera.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.889
And I'm going to show you
two demos of why this is useful.

00:01:03.913 --> 00:01:06.817
So here, I have my computer
set up with the projector,

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.198
and I have a Wii Remote
sitting on top of it.

00:01:09.222 --> 00:01:13.080
And, for example, if you're in a school
that doesn't have a lot money,

00:01:13.104 --> 00:01:14.531
probably a lot of schools,

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:18.237
or if you're in an office environment,
and you want an interactive whiteboard,

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:20.911
normally these cost
about two to three thousand dollars.

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:24.685
So I'm going to show you
how to create one with a Wii Remote.

00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:28.651
Now, this requires
another piece of hardware,

00:01:28.675 --> 00:01:30.243
which is this infrared pen.

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:33.077
You can probably make
this yourself for about five dollars

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:34.933
with a quick trip to the Radio Shack.

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:37.515
It's got a battery,
a button and an infrared LED --

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:38.697
you guys can't see it --

00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:40.952
but it turns on
whenever I push the button.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:45.514
Now, what this means is
that if I run this piece of software,

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:49.951
the camera sees the infrared dot,

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:54.160
and I can register the location
of the camera pixels

00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:55.327
to the projector pixels.

00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:58.033
And now this is like
an interactive whiteboard surface.

00:01:58.057 --> 00:01:59.779
(Applause)

00:01:59.803 --> 00:02:03.692
So for about $50 of hardware,
you can have your own whiteboard.

00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:05.899
This is Adobe Photoshop.

00:02:05.923 --> 00:02:11.588
(Applause)

00:02:11.612 --> 00:02:12.668
Thank you.

00:02:12.692 --> 00:02:14.325
(Laughter)

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.960
The software for this
I've actually put on my website

00:02:16.984 --> 00:02:18.991
and have let people download it for free.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:21.386
In the three months
this project has been public,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.678
it's been downloaded
over half a million times.

00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:25.943
So teachers and students
all around the world

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:27.313
are already using this.

00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:32.736
(Applause)

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.053
Although it does do it for 50 dollars,

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:37.134
there are some limitations
of this approach.

00:02:37.158 --> 00:02:40.560
You get about 80 percent of the way there,
for one percent of the cost.

00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:43.362
Another nice thing is that a camera
can see multiple dots,

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:46.849
so this is actually a multi-touch,
interactive whiteboard system as well.

00:02:46.873 --> 00:02:49.071
(Applause)

00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:50.223
For the second demo,

00:02:50.247 --> 00:02:52.871
I have this Wii Remote
that's actually next to the TV.

00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:57.095
So it's pointing away from the display,
rather than pointing at the display.

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.382
And why this is interesting

00:02:59.406 --> 00:03:03.120
is that if you put on, say,
a pair of safety glasses,

00:03:03.144 --> 00:03:04.958
that have two infrared dots in them,

00:03:04.982 --> 00:03:10.235
they are going to give the computer
an approximation of your head location.

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:11.561
And why this is interesting

00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:14.728
is I have this sort of application
running on the computer monitor,

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:17.284
which has a 3D room,
with some targets floating in it.

00:03:17.308 --> 00:03:19.547
And you can see that it
looks like a 3D room.

00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:22.918
kind of like a video game,
it sort of looks 3D,

00:03:22.942 --> 00:03:25.409
but for the most part,
the image looks pretty flat,

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:27.291
and bound to the surface of the screen.

00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:29.415
But if we turn on head tracking --

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.505
the computer can change
the image that's on the screen

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:37.545
and make it respond to the head movements.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:38.950
So let's switch back to that.

00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:41.976
(Laughter)

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.864
(Applause)

00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:55.864
So this has actually
been a little bit startling

00:03:55.888 --> 00:03:57.522
to the game-development community.

00:03:57.546 --> 00:03:59.368
(Laughter)

00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:02.248
Because this is about 10 dollars
of additional hardware

00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:04.131
if you already have a Nintendo Wii.

00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:06.440
So I'm looking forward
to seeing some games,

00:04:06.464 --> 00:04:08.959
and actually Louis Castle,
that's him down there,

00:04:08.983 --> 00:04:12.622
last week announced that Electronic Arts,
one of the largest game publishers,

00:04:12.646 --> 00:04:15.647
is releasing a game in May
that has a little Easter egg feature

00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:17.964
for supporting this type of head tracking.

00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:19.914
And that's from less than five months

00:04:19.938 --> 00:04:23.064
from a prototype in my lab
to a major commercial product.

00:04:23.088 --> 00:04:28.581
(Applause)

00:04:28.605 --> 00:04:29.834
Thank you.

00:04:29.858 --> 00:04:32.097
(Applause)

00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:34.520
But actually, to me,
what's almost more interesting

00:04:34.544 --> 00:04:36.116
than either of these two projects

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.435
is how people actually
found out about them.

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:41.999
YouTube has really changed the way,
or changed the speed,

00:04:42.023 --> 00:04:43.357
in which a single individual

00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:45.608
can actually spread
an idea around the world.

00:04:45.632 --> 00:04:48.632
I'm doing some research
in my lab with a video camera,

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:51.609
and within the first week,
a million people had seen this work,

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:55.224
and literally within days,
engineers, teachers and students

00:04:55.248 --> 00:04:58.439
from around the world were already
posting their own YouTube videos

00:04:58.463 --> 00:05:01.823
of them using my system
or derivatives of this work.

00:05:01.847 --> 00:05:04.387
So I hope to see more
of that in the future,

00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:07.983
and hope online video distribution
to be embraced by the research community.

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.260
So thank you very much.

00:05:09.284 --> 00:05:12.773
(Applause)
