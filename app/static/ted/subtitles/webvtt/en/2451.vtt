WEBVTT

00:00:00.823 --> 00:00:02.109
There we were,

00:00:03.354 --> 00:00:06.738
souls and bodies packed
into a Texas church

00:00:07.428 --> 00:00:09.649
on the last night of our lives.

00:00:10.856 --> 00:00:12.699
Packed into a room just like this,

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:18.294
but with creaky wooden pews
draped in worn-down red fabric,

00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:21.958
with an organ to my left
and a choir at my back

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:24.862
and a baptism pool
built into the wall behind them.

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:28.271
A room like this, nonetheless.

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:32.060
With the same great feelings of suspense,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.568
the same deep hopes for salvation,

00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:38.379
the same sweat in the palms

00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:41.894
and the same people
in the back not paying attention.

00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:43.845
(Laughter)

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.416
This was December 31, 1999,

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:51.536
the night of the Second Coming of Christ,

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:54.692
and the end of the world as I knew it.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.648
I had turned 12 that year

00:00:57.672 --> 00:00:59.991
and had reached the age of accountability.

00:01:00.742 --> 00:01:02.542
And once I stopped complaining

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.017
about how unfair it was
that Jesus would return

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:08.530
as soon as I had to be accountable
for all that I had done,

00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:11.517
I figured I had better get
my house in order very quickly.

00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:14.391
So I went to church as often as I could.

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:19.247
I listened for silence as anxiously
as one might listen for noise,

00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:22.361
trying to be sure that the Lord
hadn't pulled a fast one on me

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:23.960
and decided to come back early.

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:26.304
And just in case he did,

00:01:26.988 --> 00:01:28.614
I built a backup plan,

00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:33.158
by reading the "Left Behind" books
that were all the rage at the time.

00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:35.115
And I found in their pages

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.880
that if I was not taken
in the rapture at midnight,

00:01:37.904 --> 00:01:39.158
I had another shot.

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.005
All I had to do was avoid
taking the mark of the beast,

00:01:43.808 --> 00:01:46.920
fight off demons, plagues
and the Antichrist himself.

00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:48.131
It would be hard --

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:51.324
(Laughter)

00:01:51.348 --> 00:01:52.906
but I knew I could do it.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.433
(Laughter)

00:01:54.457 --> 00:01:56.245
But planning time was over now.

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:58.085
It was 11:50pm.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:59.271
We had 10 minutes left,

00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:02.289
and my pastor called us
out of the pews and down to the altar

00:02:02.313 --> 00:02:06.449
because he wanted to be praying
when midnight struck.

00:02:07.808 --> 00:02:09.818
So every faction of the congregation

00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:11.145
took its place.

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.915
The choir stayed in the choir stand,

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.412
the deacons and their wives --

00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:16.939
or the Baptist Bourgeoisie
as I like to call them --

00:02:16.963 --> 00:02:18.249
(Laughter)

00:02:18.273 --> 00:02:20.480
took first position in front of the altar.

00:02:20.504 --> 00:02:22.189
You see, in America,

00:02:22.824 --> 00:02:25.885
even the Second Coming of Christ
has a VIP section.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.239
(Laughter)

00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:30.263
(Applause)

00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:35.576
And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.529
were the elderly --

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:42.441
these men and women whose young backs
had been bent under hot suns

00:02:42.465 --> 00:02:44.446
in the cotton fields of East Texas,

00:02:45.137 --> 00:02:48.853
and whose skin seemed to be burnt
a creaseless noble brown,

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.551
just like the clay of East Texas,

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.604
and whose hopes and dreams
for what life might become

00:02:53.628 --> 00:02:54.779
outside of East Texas

00:02:54.803 --> 00:02:56.446
had sometimes been bent and broken

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.969
even further than their backs.

00:02:57.993 --> 00:03:01.873
Yes, these men and women
were the stars of the show for me.

00:03:02.742 --> 00:03:05.080
They had waited their whole lives
for this moment,

00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:09.079
just as their medieval predecessors
had longed for the end of the world,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.897
and just as my grandmother
waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show

00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:15.166
to come on Channel 8
every day at 4 o'clock.

00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:18.191
And as she made her way to the altar,

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:20.310
I snuck right in behind her,

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:22.308
because I knew for sure

00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:24.408
that my grandmother was going to heaven.

00:03:25.126 --> 00:03:29.431
And I thought that if I held on
to her hand during this prayer,

00:03:30.282 --> 00:03:32.155
I might go right on with her.

00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:34.301
So I held on

00:03:34.802 --> 00:03:36.468
and I closed my eyes

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.220
to listen,

00:03:38.678 --> 00:03:39.828
to wait.

00:03:40.314 --> 00:03:41.838
And the prayers got louder.

00:03:42.428 --> 00:03:44.869
And the shouts of response
to the call of the prayer

00:03:44.893 --> 00:03:46.296
went up higher even still.

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:49.126
And the organ rolled on in
to add the dirge.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.343
And the heat came on to add to the sweat.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.976
And my hand gripped firmer,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.013
so I wouldn't be the one
left in the field.

00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:56.236
My eyes clenched tighter

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.232
so I wouldn't see the wheat
being separated from the chaff.

00:03:59.256 --> 00:04:01.625
And then a voice rang out above us:

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.443
"Amen."

00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:06.628
It was over.

00:04:08.044 --> 00:04:09.346
I looked at the clock.

00:04:10.643 --> 00:04:11.936
It was after midnight.

00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:15.018
I looked at the elder believers

00:04:15.697 --> 00:04:17.565
whose savior had not come,

00:04:18.205 --> 00:04:21.022
who were too proud to show
any signs of disappointment,

00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:23.439
who had believed too much and for too long

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.585
to start doubting now.

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:29.842
But I was upset on their behalf.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.339
They had been duped,

00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:33.872
hoodwinked, bamboozled,

00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:35.921
and I had gone right along with them.

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.030
I had prayed their prayers,

00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:41.000
I had yielded not to temptation
as best I could.

00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:43.444
I had dipped my head not once, but twice

00:04:44.074 --> 00:04:46.439
in that snot-inducing baptism pool.

00:04:46.463 --> 00:04:47.726
I had believed.

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:50.531
Now what?

00:04:51.706 --> 00:04:54.821
I got home just in time
to turn on the television

00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:57.289
and watch Peter Jennings
announce the new millennium

00:04:57.313 --> 00:04:59.002
as it rolled in around the world.

00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:03.841
It struck me that it would have
been strange anyway,

00:05:03.865 --> 00:05:06.245
for Jesus to come back again and again

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:07.905
based on the different time zones.

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:13.242
(Laughter)

00:05:15.037 --> 00:05:17.210
And this made me feel
even more ridiculous --

00:05:18.354 --> 00:05:19.555
hurt, really.

00:05:21.076 --> 00:05:24.245
But there on that night,
I did not stop believing.

00:05:25.197 --> 00:05:26.781
I just believed a new thing:

00:05:27.487 --> 00:05:29.919
that it was possible not to believe.

00:05:30.894 --> 00:05:33.306
It was possible the answers
I had were wrong,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.677
that the questions themselves were wrong.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:39.263
And now, where there was once
a mountain of certitude,

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:42.583
there was, running right down
to its foundation,

00:05:43.168 --> 00:05:44.721
a spring of doubt,

00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:47.461
a spring that promised rivers.

00:05:48.357 --> 00:05:51.490
I can trace the whole drama of my life

00:05:51.514 --> 00:05:53.140
back to that night in that church

00:05:53.164 --> 00:05:55.246
when my savior did not come for me;

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.591
when the thing I believed most certainly

00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:01.325
turned out to be, if not a lie,

00:06:01.841 --> 00:06:03.461
then not quite the truth.

00:06:04.355 --> 00:06:08.150
And even though most of you
prepared for Y2K in a very different way,

00:06:08.937 --> 00:06:11.322
I'm convinced that you are here

00:06:11.346 --> 00:06:15.254
because some part of you has done
the same thing that I have done

00:06:15.278 --> 00:06:17.301
since the dawn of this new century,

00:06:18.014 --> 00:06:20.460
since my mother left
and my father stayed away

00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:22.165
and my Lord refused to come.

00:06:22.867 --> 00:06:24.354
And I held out my hand,

00:06:24.378 --> 00:06:27.330
reaching for something to believe in.

00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:31.479
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,

00:06:32.318 --> 00:06:34.832
with the faith that my journey
from Oak Cliff, Texas

00:06:34.856 --> 00:06:38.545
was a chance to leave behind
all the challenges I had known,

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.400
the broken dreams
and broken bodies I had seen.

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:46.079
But when I found myself back home
one winter break,

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:49.208
with my face planted in the floor,

00:06:50.268 --> 00:06:52.603
my hands tied behind my back

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.512
and a burglar's gun pressed to my head,

00:06:55.536 --> 00:06:59.379
I knew that even the best education
couldn't save me.

00:07:00.181 --> 00:07:03.293
I held on when I showed up
at Lehman Brothers

00:07:03.317 --> 00:07:05.331
as an intern in 2008.

00:07:07.048 --> 00:07:11.715
(Laughter)

00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:13.054
So hopeful --

00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:16.340
(Laughter)

00:07:16.364 --> 00:07:18.383
that I called home to inform my family

00:07:18.407 --> 00:07:19.957
that we'd never be poor again.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.071
(Laughter)

00:07:22.767 --> 00:07:24.801
But as I witnessed this temple of finance

00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:26.640
come crashing down before my eyes,

00:07:26.664 --> 00:07:29.940
I knew that even the best job
couldn't save me.

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:36.452
I held on when I showed up
in Washington DC as a young staffer,

00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:38.701
who had heard a voice
call out from Illinois,

00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:40.853
saying, "It's been a long time coming,

00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:45.372
but in this election, change
has come to America."

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.291
But as the Congress ground to a halt

00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:50.033
and the country ripped at the seams

00:07:50.057 --> 00:07:52.490
and hope and change
began to feel like a cruel joke,

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:55.821
I knew that even
the political second coming

00:07:55.845 --> 00:07:57.068
could not save me.

00:07:57.856 --> 00:08:02.316
I had knelt faithfully at the altar
of the American Dream,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.518
praying to the gods of my time

00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:06.411
of success,

00:08:06.834 --> 00:08:07.984
and money,

00:08:08.358 --> 00:08:09.508
and power.

00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:12.037
But over and over again,

00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:15.662
midnight struck, and I opened my eyes

00:08:15.686 --> 00:08:18.154
to see that all of these gods were dead.

00:08:19.447 --> 00:08:20.828
And from that graveyard,

00:08:20.852 --> 00:08:22.297
I began the search once more,

00:08:22.321 --> 00:08:23.591
not because I was brave,

00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:27.020
but because I knew
that I would either believe

00:08:27.044 --> 00:08:28.271
or I would die.

00:08:28.963 --> 00:08:31.754
So I took a pilgrimage
to yet another mecca,

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:33.755
Harvard Business School --

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:36.283
(Laughter)

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:40.192
this time, knowing that I could not
simply accept the salvation

00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:41.446
that it claimed to offer.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.065
No, I knew there'd be more work to do.

00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:49.276
The work began in the dark corner
of a crowded party,

00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:53.552
in the late night of an early,
miserable Cambridge winter,

00:08:54.457 --> 00:08:56.493
when three friends and I asked a question

00:08:56.517 --> 00:08:59.167
that young folks searching
for something real have asked

00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:00.958
for a very long time:

00:09:00.982 --> 00:09:02.656
"What if we took a road trip?"

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.724
(Laughter)

00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:08.729
We didn't know where'd we go
or how we'd get there,

00:09:08.753 --> 00:09:10.514
but we knew we had to do it.

00:09:11.108 --> 00:09:14.124
Because all our lives we yearned,
as Jack Kerouac wrote,

00:09:14.148 --> 00:09:18.100
to "sneak out into the night
and disappear somewhere,"

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.044
and go find out what everybody was doing

00:09:21.068 --> 00:09:22.340
all over the country.

00:09:23.242 --> 00:09:25.519
So even though there were
other voices who said

00:09:25.543 --> 00:09:27.996
that the risk was too great
and the proof too thin,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.376
we went on anyhow.

00:09:30.354 --> 00:09:35.626
We went on 8,000 miles across America
in the summer of 2013,

00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:39.798
through the cow pastures of Montana,
through the desolation of Detroit,

00:09:39.822 --> 00:09:41.445
through the swamps of New Orleans,

00:09:41.469 --> 00:09:44.071
where we found and worked
with men and women

00:09:44.095 --> 00:09:45.780
who were building small businesses

00:09:45.804 --> 00:09:48.749
that made purpose their bottom line.

00:09:49.962 --> 00:09:52.648
And having been trained
at the West Point of capitalism,

00:09:52.672 --> 00:09:54.776
this struck us as a revolutionary idea.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.816
(Laughter)

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.824
And this idea spread,

00:09:58.412 --> 00:10:02.150
growing into a nonprofit
called MBAs Across America,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.229
a movement that landed me here
on this stage today.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.797
It spread because we found
a great hunger in our generation

00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:14.264
for purpose, for meaning.

00:10:15.317 --> 00:10:18.015
It spread because we found
countless entrepreneurs

00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:19.947
in the nooks and crannies of America

00:10:19.971 --> 00:10:22.424
who were creating jobs and changing lives

00:10:22.448 --> 00:10:23.977
and who needed a little help.

00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:28.368
But if I'm being honest, it also spread

00:10:28.392 --> 00:10:30.094
because I fought to spread it.

00:10:31.204 --> 00:10:33.447
There was no length
to which I would not go

00:10:33.471 --> 00:10:34.627
to preach this gospel,

00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:37.487
to get more people to believe

00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:39.910
that we could bind the wounds
of a broken country,

00:10:39.934 --> 00:10:42.091
one social business at a time.

00:10:43.116 --> 00:10:46.289
But it was this journey of evangelism

00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:49.497
that led me to the rather different gospel

00:10:50.136 --> 00:10:52.772
that I've come to share with you today.

00:10:53.867 --> 00:10:57.079
It began one evening almost a year ago

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:01.393
at the Museum of Natural History
in New York City,

00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:05.123
at a gala for alumni
of Harvard Business School.

00:11:06.341 --> 00:11:08.876
Under a full-size replica of a whale,

00:11:09.573 --> 00:11:11.924
I sat with the titans of our time

00:11:11.948 --> 00:11:14.669
as they celebrated their peers
and their good deeds.

00:11:15.727 --> 00:11:17.011
There was pride in a room

00:11:17.035 --> 00:11:19.914
where net worth
and assets under management

00:11:19.938 --> 00:11:22.317
surpassed half a trillion dollars.

00:11:23.196 --> 00:11:25.203
We looked over all that we had made,

00:11:25.863 --> 00:11:27.028
and it was good.

00:11:27.927 --> 00:11:29.914
(Laughter)

00:11:30.868 --> 00:11:32.296
But it just so happened,

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:34.145
two days later,

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.693
I had to travel up the road to Harlem,

00:11:37.455 --> 00:11:39.894
where I found myself
sitting in an urban farm

00:11:39.918 --> 00:11:41.703
that had once been a vacant lot,

00:11:42.416 --> 00:11:45.316
listening to a man named Tony
tell me of the kids

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.898
that showed up there every day.

00:11:47.944 --> 00:11:51.267
All of them lived below the poverty line.

00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:55.495
Many of them carried
all of their belongings in a backpack

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:57.704
to avoid losing them
in a homeless shelter.

00:11:58.432 --> 00:12:01.680
Some of them came to Tony's program,

00:12:01.704 --> 00:12:03.051
called Harlem Grown,

00:12:03.677 --> 00:12:06.024
to get the only meal they had each day.

00:12:07.465 --> 00:12:12.080
Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown
with money from his pension,

00:12:12.954 --> 00:12:15.207
after 20 years as a cab driver.

00:12:16.232 --> 00:12:18.551
He told me that he didn't give
himself a salary,

00:12:19.342 --> 00:12:23.184
because despite success,
the program struggled for resources.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.100
He told me that he would take any help

00:12:26.665 --> 00:12:27.822
that he could get.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.136
And I was there as that help.

00:12:32.863 --> 00:12:37.158
But as I left Tony,
I felt the sting and salt of tears

00:12:37.838 --> 00:12:39.375
welling up in my eyes.

00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:42.474
I felt the weight of revelation

00:12:43.187 --> 00:12:46.319
that I could sit in one room on one night,

00:12:47.206 --> 00:12:51.308
where a few hundred people
had half a trillion dollars,

00:12:52.187 --> 00:12:54.248
and another room, two days later,

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.117
just 50 blocks up the road,

00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:00.215
where a man was going without a salary

00:13:00.897 --> 00:13:03.791
to get a child her only meal of the day.

00:13:04.887 --> 00:13:08.417
And it wasn't the glaring inequality
that made me want to cry,

00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:11.252
it wasn't the thought of hungry,
homeless kids,

00:13:11.276 --> 00:13:13.112
it wasn't rage toward the one percent

00:13:13.136 --> 00:13:15.414
or pity toward the 99.

00:13:15.787 --> 00:13:19.572
No, I was disturbed
because I had finally realized

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.599
that I was the dialysis

00:13:22.623 --> 00:13:25.820
for a country that needed
a kidney transplant.

00:13:26.647 --> 00:13:30.316
I realized that my story
stood in for all those

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.182
who were expected to pick
themselves up by their bootstraps,

00:13:33.206 --> 00:13:35.352
even if they didn't have any boots;

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.855
that my organization stood in

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:41.629
for all the structural, systemic help
that never went to Harlem

00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:43.598
or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward;

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:48.401
that my voice stood in
for all those voices

00:13:49.098 --> 00:13:54.241
that seemed too unlearned,
too unwashed, too unaccommodated.

00:13:55.273 --> 00:13:56.538
And the shame of that,

00:13:57.721 --> 00:13:59.108
that shame washed over me

00:13:59.132 --> 00:14:01.993
like the shame of sitting
in front of the television,

00:14:02.898 --> 00:14:05.397
watching Peter Jennings
announce the new millennium

00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:06.629
again

00:14:06.653 --> 00:14:07.803
and again

00:14:08.257 --> 00:14:09.407
and again.

00:14:09.796 --> 00:14:10.946
I had been duped,

00:14:12.084 --> 00:14:13.234
hoodwinked,

00:14:13.696 --> 00:14:14.846
bamboozled.

00:14:15.403 --> 00:14:18.477
But this time, the false savior was me.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.302
You see, I've come a long way 
from that altar

00:14:23.326 --> 00:14:25.422
on the night I thought
the world would end,

00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:28.576
from a world where people spoke in tongues

00:14:29.107 --> 00:14:31.745
and saw suffering
as a necessary act of God

00:14:32.222 --> 00:14:34.290
and took a text to be infallible truth.

00:14:34.314 --> 00:14:35.839
Yes, I've come so far

00:14:36.607 --> 00:14:39.143
that I'm right back where I started.

00:14:40.103 --> 00:14:42.318
Because it simply is not true to say

00:14:42.342 --> 00:14:44.223
that we live in an age of disbelief --

00:14:44.247 --> 00:14:48.563
no, we believe today just as much
as any time that came before.

00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:52.252
Some of us may believe
in the prophecy of Brené Brown

00:14:52.276 --> 00:14:53.452
or Tony Robbins.

00:14:54.003 --> 00:14:56.103
We may believe in the bible
of The New Yorker

00:14:56.127 --> 00:14:57.737
or the Harvard Business Review.

00:14:58.146 --> 00:14:59.725
We may believe most deeply

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.752
when we worship right here
at the church of TED,

00:15:03.347 --> 00:15:05.528
but we desperately want to believe,

00:15:05.552 --> 00:15:07.098
we need to believe.

00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:10.186
We speak in the tongues
of charismatic leaders

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.402
that promise to solve all our problems.

00:15:12.426 --> 00:15:16.506
We see suffering as a necessary act
of the capitalism that is our god,

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.762
we take the text of technological progress

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.233
to be infallible truth.

00:15:22.034 --> 00:15:25.650
And we hardly realize
the human price we pay

00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:28.762
when we fail to question one brick,

00:15:29.692 --> 00:15:32.641
because we fear it might shake
our whole foundation.

00:15:33.677 --> 00:15:35.278
But if you are disturbed

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.210
by the unconscionable things
that we have come to accept,

00:15:39.777 --> 00:15:42.683
then it must be questioning time.

00:15:43.987 --> 00:15:48.034
So I have not a gospel
of disruption or innovation

00:15:48.058 --> 00:15:49.508
or a triple bottom line.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.985
I do not have a gospel of faith
to share with you today, in fact.

00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:58.967
I have and I offer a gospel of doubt.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.020
The gospel of doubt does not ask
that you stop believing,

00:16:03.737 --> 00:16:05.657
it asks that you believe a new thing:

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.737
that it is possible not to believe.

00:16:09.512 --> 00:16:11.682
It is possible the answers
we have are wrong,

00:16:11.706 --> 00:16:14.289
it is possible the questions
themselves are wrong.

00:16:14.313 --> 00:16:18.135
Yes, the gospel of doubt means
that it is possible that we,

00:16:18.619 --> 00:16:20.745
on this stage, in this room,

00:16:21.178 --> 00:16:22.335
are wrong.

00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:25.044
Because it raises the question, "Why?"

00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:28.964
With all the power
that we hold in our hands,

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:32.368
why are people still suffering so bad?

00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:37.764
This doubt leads me to share
that we are putting my organization,

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.054
MBAs Across America,

00:16:39.078 --> 00:16:40.706
out of business.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.222
We have shed our staff
and closed our doors

00:16:43.246 --> 00:16:45.274
and we will share our model freely

00:16:45.298 --> 00:16:48.184
with anyone who sees
their power to do this work

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.056
without waiting for our permission.

00:16:50.434 --> 00:16:52.755
This doubt compels me

00:16:53.236 --> 00:16:55.009
to renounce the role of savior

00:16:55.033 --> 00:16:56.428
that some have placed on me,

00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:59.996
because our time is too short
and our odds are too long

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.800
to wait for second comings,

00:17:01.824 --> 00:17:05.308
when the truth is that
there will be no miracles here.

00:17:06.305 --> 00:17:08.049
And this doubt, it fuels me,

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:10.028
it gives me hope

00:17:10.606 --> 00:17:12.856
that when our troubles overwhelm us,

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.879
when the paths laid out for us
seem to lead to our demise,

00:17:18.528 --> 00:17:21.556
when our healers bring
no comfort to our wounds,

00:17:22.286 --> 00:17:24.617
it will not be our blind faith --

00:17:25.423 --> 00:17:27.810
no, it will be our humble doubt

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.041
that shines a little light
into the darkness of our lives

00:17:32.065 --> 00:17:33.298
and of our world

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.039
and lets us raise our voice to whisper

00:17:36.833 --> 00:17:37.983
or to shout

00:17:38.437 --> 00:17:40.152
or to say simply,

00:17:40.176 --> 00:17:41.326
very simply,

00:17:41.706 --> 00:17:44.222
"There must be another way."

00:17:45.011 --> 00:17:46.162
Thank you.

00:17:46.186 --> 00:18:06.408
(Applause)
