00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.256
In case you are wondering,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.880
no, I'm not wearing a dress,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.160
and no, I'm not saying
what I'm wearing underneath.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.296
(Laughter)

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.240
This is a gho.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.360
This is my national dress.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.960
This is how all men dress in Bhutan.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.200
That is how our women dress.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.496
Like our women,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.600
we men get to wear pretty bright colors,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.240
but unlike our women,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.816
we get to show off our legs.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.856
(Laughter)

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.296
Our national dress is unique,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.520
but this is not the only thing
that's unique about my country.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.176
Our promise to remain
carbon neutral is also unique,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.416
and this is what I'd like
to speak about today,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.800
our promise to remain carbon neutral.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.680
But before I proceed,
I should set you the context.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.160
I should tell you our story.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.240
Bhutan is a small country
in the Himalayas.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.296
We've been called Shangri-La,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.000
even the last Shangri-La.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.456
But let me tell you right off the bat,
we are not Shangri-La.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.216
My country is not one big monastery

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.896
populated with happy monks.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.576
(Laughter)

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.296
The reality is that
there are barely 700,000 of us

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.256
sandwiched between two
of the most populated countries on earth,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.440
China and India.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.536
The reality is that we are a small,
underdeveloped country

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.360
doing our best to survive.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.400
But we are doing OK. We are surviving.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.120
In fact, we are thriving,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.360
and the reason we are thriving
is because we've been blessed

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.096
with extraordinary kings.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.136
Our enlightened monarchs
have worked tirelessly

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.016
to develop our country,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.616
balancing economic growth carefully

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.536
with social development,
environmental sustainability

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.416
and cultural preservation,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.919
all within the framework
of good governance.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.056
We call this holistic approach
to development

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.800
"Gross National Happiness," or GNH.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.456
Back in the 1970s,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.016
our fourth king famously
pronounced that for Bhutan,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.576
Gross National Happiness is more important
than Gross National Product.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.480
(Applause)

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.600
Ever since,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.080
all development in Bhutan
is driven by GNH,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.976
a pioneering vision
that aims to improve the happiness

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.840
and well-being of our people.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.936
But that's easier said than done,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.880
especially when you are one
of the smallest economies in the world.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.680
Our entire GDP is less
than two billion dollars.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.416
I know that some of you here
are worth more --

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.696
(Laughter)

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.256
individually

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.760
than the entire economy of my country.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.856
So our economy is small,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.690
but here is where it gets interesting.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.760
Education is completely free.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.416
All citizens are guaranteed
free school education,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.416
and those that work hard
are given free college education.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.896
Healthcare is also completely free.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.976
Medical consultation,
medical treatment, medicines:

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.880
they are all provided by the state.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.640
We manage this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.720
because we use our limited
resources very carefully,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.256
and because we stay faithful
to the core mission of GNH,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.080
which is development with values.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.496
Our economy is small,
and we must strengthen it.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.696
Economic growth is important,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.856
but that economic growth must not come
from undermining our unique culture

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.960
or our pristine environment.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.360
Today, our culture is flourishing.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.776
We continue to celebrate
our art and architecture,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.400
food and festivals,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.960
monks and monasteries.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.640
And yes, we celebrate
our national dress, too.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.000
This is why I can wear my gho with pride.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.440
Here's a fun fact:

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.120
you're looking
at the world's biggest pocket.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.096
(Laughter)

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.136
It starts here,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.336
goes around the back,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.840
and comes out from inside here.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.896
In this pocket

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.936
we store all manner of personal goods

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.880
from phones and wallets

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.296
to iPads, office files and books.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.536
(Laughter)

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.256
(Applause)

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.816
But sometimes --

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.840
sometimes even precious cargo.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.800
So our culture is flourishing,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.016
but so is our environment.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.440
72 percent of my country
is under forest cover.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.416
Our constitution demands
that a minimum of 60 percent

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.136
of Bhutan's total land
shall remain under forest cover

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.376
for all time.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.920
(Applause)

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.600
Our constitution,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.800
this constitution,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.240
imposes forest cover on us.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.096
Incidentally, our king
used this constitution

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.880
to impose democracy on us.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.816
You see, we the people
didn't want democracy.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.816
We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.640
and we certainly didn't fight for it.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.976
Instead, our king imposed democracy on us

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.840
by insisting that he include it
in the constitution.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.760
But he went further.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.120
He included provisions in the constitution

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.360
that empower the people
to impeach their kings,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.616
and included provisions in here
that require all our kings to retire

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.080
at the age of 65.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.896
(Applause)

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.240
Fact is, we already have
a king in retirement:

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.136
our previous king, the Great Fourth,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.616
retired 10 years ago

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.920
at the peak of his popularity.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.680
He was all of 51 years at that time.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.400
So as I was saying,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.896
72 percent of our country
is under forest cover,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.160
and all that forest is pristine.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.096
That's why we are one of the few remaining

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.136
global biodiversity hotspots in the world,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.520
and that's why we are
a carbon neutral country.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.696
In a world that is threatened
with climate change,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.640
we are a carbon neutral country.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.240
Turns out, it's a big deal.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.296
Of the 200-odd countries
in the world today,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.080
it looks like we are the only one

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.800
that's carbon neutral.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.480
Actually, that's not quite accurate.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.880
Bhutan is not carbon neutral.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.240
Bhutan is carbon negative.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.536
Our entire country generates
2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.400
but our forests, they sequester
more than three times that amount,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.856
so we are a net carbon sink

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.800
for more than four million tons
of carbon dioxide each year.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.416
But that's not all.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.536
(Applause)

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.656
We export most
of the renewable electricity

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.840
we generate from our fast-flowing rivers.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.576
So today, the clean energy that we export

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.680
offsets about six million tons
of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.176
By 2020, we'll be exporting
enough electricity

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.880
to offset 17 million tons
of carbon dioxide.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.936
And if we were to harness
even half our hydropower potential,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.000
and that's exactly what we are working at,

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.496
the clean, green energy that we export

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.640
would offset something like
50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.200
That is more CO2 than what the entire city
of New York generates in one year.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.256
So inside our country,
we are a net carbon sink.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.816
Outside, we are offsetting carbon.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.200
And this is important stuff.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.039
You see, the world is getting warmer,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.120
and climate change is a reality.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.680
Climate change is affecting my country.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.720
Our glaciers are melting,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.856
causing flash floods and landslides,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.320
which in turn are causing disaster
and widespread destruction in our country.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.200
I was at that lake recently.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.000
It's stunning.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.216
That's how it looked 10 years ago,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.840
and that's how it looked 20 years ago.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.160
Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.680
It was a solid glacier.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.560
A few years ago, a similar lake

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.160
breached its dams

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.160
and wreaked havoc in the valleys below.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.376
That destruction
was caused by one glacier lake.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.320
We have 2,700 of them to contend with.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.880
The point is this:

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.616
my country and my people have done nothing

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.520
to contribute to global warming,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.040
but we are already bearing the brunt
of its consequences.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.576
And for a small, poor country,
one that is landlocked and mountainous,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.360
it is very difficult.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.936
But we are not going to sit
on our hands doing nothing.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.360
We will fight climate change.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.480
That's why we have promised
to remain carbon neutral.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.816
We first made this promise in 2009

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.600
during COP 15 in Copenhagen,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.000
but nobody noticed.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.616
Governments were so busy
arguing with one another

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.576
and blaming each other
for causing climate change,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.256
that when a small country
raised our hands and announced,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.376
"We promise to remain
carbon neutral for all time,"

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.600
nobody heard us.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.080
Nobody cared.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.200
Last December in Paris,

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.736
at COP 21, we reiterated our promise

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.320
to remain carbon neutral
for all time to come.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.080
This time, we were heard.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.280
We were noticed, and everybody cared.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.136
What was different in Paris
was that governments came round together

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.776
to accept the realities of climate change,

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.160
and were willing to come together
and act together and work together.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.160
All countries, from the very small
to the very large,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.360
committed to reduce
the greenhouse gas emissions.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.776
The UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.560
says that if these so-called
intended commitments are kept,

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.616
we'd be closer
to containing global warming

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.000
by two degrees Celsius.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.640
By the way,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.376
I've requested the TED organizers here

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.280
to turn up the heat in here
by two degrees,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.336
so if some of you
are feeling warmer than usual,

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.560
you know who to blame.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.160
It's crucial that all of us
keep our commitments.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.056
As far as Bhutan is concerned,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.520
we will keep our promise
to remain carbon neutral.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.600
Here are some of the ways we are doing it.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.600
We are providing free electricity
to our rural farmers.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.536
The idea is that, with free electricity,
they will no longer have to use firewood

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.760
to cook their food.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.336
We are investing in sustainable transport

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.816
and subsidizing the purchase
of electric vehicles.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.976
Similarly, we are subsidizing
the cost of LED lights,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.296
and our entire government
is trying to go paperless.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.816
We are cleaning up our entire country
through Clean Bhutan, a national program,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.976
and we are planting trees
throughout our country

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.440
through Green Bhutan,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.280
another national program.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.496
But it is our protected areas

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.840
that are at the core
of our carbon neutral strategy.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.536
Our protected areas are our carbon sink.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.360
They are our lungs.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.376
Today, more than half
our country is protected,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.776
as national parks, nature reserves

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.720
and wildlife sanctuaries.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.496
But the beauty is that we've connected
them all with one another

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.440
through a network of biological corridors.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.376
Now, what this means

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.320
is that our animals are free
to roam throughout our country.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.176
Take this tiger, for example.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.896
It was spotted
at 250 meters above sea level

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.240
in the hot, subtropical jungles.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.016
Two years later, that same tiger

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.536
was spotted near 4,000 meters

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.080
in our cold alpine mountains.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.040
Isn't that awesome?

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.776
(Applause)

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.640
We must keep it that way.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.560
We must keep our parks awesome.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.536
So every year, we set aside resources
to prevent poaching, hunting,

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.936
mining and pollution in our parks,

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.096
and resources to help communities
who live in those parks

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.616
manage their forests,

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.096
adapt to climate change,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.120
and lead better lives while continuing
to live in harmony with Mother Nature.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.840
But that is expensive.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.376
Over the next few years,
our small economy won't have the resources

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.120
to cover all the costs that are required
to protect our environment.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.176
In fact, when we run the numbers,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.896
it looks like it'll take us
at least 15 years

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.080
before we can fully finance
all our conservation efforts.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.520
But neither Bhutan,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.920
nor the world

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.640
can afford to spend 15 years
going backwards.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.840
This is why His Majesty the King

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.360
started Bhutan For Life.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.896
Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.320
It gives us breathing room.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.496
It is essentially a funding mechanism

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.456
to look after our parks,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.920
to protect our parks,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.560
until our government
can take over on our own fully.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.496
The idea is to raise a transition fund

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.840
from individual donors,
corporations and institutions,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.376
but the deal is closed only
after predetermined conditions are met

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.000
and all funds committed.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.840
So multiparty, single closing:

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.520
an idea we borrowed from Wall Street.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.976
This means that individual donors
can commit without having to worry

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.960
that they'll be left
supporting an underfunded plan.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.736
It's something like a Kickstarter project,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.136
only with a 15-year time horizon

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.480
and millions of tons
of carbon dioxide at stake.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.120
Once the deal is closed,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.376
we use the transition fund
to protect our parks,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.576
giving our government time
to increase our own funding gradually

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.616
until the end of the 15-year period.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:06.200
After that, our government
guarantees full funding forever.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.320
We are almost there.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.640
We expect to close later this year.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.336
Naturally, I'm pretty excited.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.000
(Applause)

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:26.320
The World Wildlife Fund
is our principle partner in this journey,

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.016
and I want to give them a big shoutout

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.360
for the excellent work
they are doing in Bhutan

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.416
and across the world.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.016
(Applause)

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.000
Whew, it is getting warm in here.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.320
I thank you for listening to our story,

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.656
a story of how we are keeping
our promise to remain carbon neutral,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.400
a story of how we are keeping
our country pristine,

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:06.040
for ourselves, our children,

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.839
for your children and for the world.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.640
But we are not here
to tell stories, are we?

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.400
We are here to dream together.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:21.079
So in closing, I'd like to share
one more dream that I have.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.816
What if we could mobilize
our leadership and our resources,

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.496
our influence and our passion,

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.816
to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea
to other countries

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.280
so that they too

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.920
can conserve their
protected areas for all time.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.922
After all, there are many other countries
who face the same issues that we face.

00:17:41.946 --> 00:17:44.136
They too have natural resources

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.080
that can help win the world's fight
for sustainability,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.056
only they may not have the ability
to invest in them now.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.520
So what if we set up Earth For Life,

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.200
a global fund, to kickstart
the Bhutan For Life throughout the world?

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.800
I invite you to help me,

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.176
to carry this dream beyond our borders

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.640
to all those who care
about our planet's future.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.160
After all, we're here to dream together,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.776
to work together,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.400
to fight climate change together,
to protect our planet together.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.840
Because the reality is

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.680
we are in it together.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.800
Some of us might dress differently,

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.760
but we are in it together.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.000
Thank you very much,

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.216
and kadrin chhe la. Thank you.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.856
(Applause)

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
