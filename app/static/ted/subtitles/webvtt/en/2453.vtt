00:00:00.777 --> 00:00:02.662
The following are my opinions,

00:00:02.686 --> 00:00:04.693
and do not reflect
the opinions or policies

00:00:04.717 --> 00:00:06.701
of any particular prosecutor's office.

00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:08.069
(Laughter)

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:11.122
I am a prosecutor.

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:12.692
I believe in law and order.

00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:16.361
I am the adopted son of a police officer,
a Marine and a hairdresser.

00:00:17.139 --> 00:00:20.079
I believe in accountability

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.818
and that we should all be safe
in our communities.

00:00:24.145 --> 00:00:26.463
I love my job

00:00:26.487 --> 00:00:27.952
and the people that do it.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.474
I just think that it's our responsibility

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:31.664
to do it better.

00:00:33.213 --> 00:00:35.262
By a show of hands,

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:38.000
how many of you, by the age of 25,

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:39.888
had either acted up in school,

00:00:39.912 --> 00:00:42.651
went somewhere you were
specifically told to stay out of,

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.887
or drank alcohol before your legal age?

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:47.790
(Laughter)

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:48.964
All right.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.759
How many of you shoplifted,

00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:53.783
tried an illegal drug

00:00:53.807 --> 00:00:55.486
or got into a physical fight --

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.949
yes, even with a sibling?

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.600
Now, how many of you
ever spent one day in jail

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:04.419
for any of those decisions?

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:11.443
How many of you sitting here today

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.278
think that you're a danger to society

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:16.622
or should be defined by those actions
of youthful indiscretion?

00:01:17.907 --> 00:01:19.300
(Laughter)

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:21.834
Point taken.

00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:25.809
When we talk about
criminal justice reform,

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:28.355
we often focus on a few things,

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:32.465
and that's what I want
to talk to you about today.

00:01:32.783 --> 00:01:35.170
But first I'm going to --
since you shared with me,

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:37.361
I'm going to give you
a confession on my part.

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:38.789
I went to law school

00:01:38.813 --> 00:01:40.082
to make money.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.796
I had no interest
in being a public servant,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.507
I had no interest in criminal law,

00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:48.061
and I definitely didn't think
that I would ever be a prosecutor.

00:01:48.888 --> 00:01:51.894
Near the end of my first year
of law school, I got an internship

00:01:51.918 --> 00:01:54.897
in the Roxbury Division
of Boston Municipal Court.

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:58.441
I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished
neighborhood in Boston,

00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:02.057
plagued by gun violence and drug crime.

00:02:03.835 --> 00:02:08.612
My life and my legal career changed
the first day of that internship.

00:02:09.973 --> 00:02:13.895
I walked into a courtroom,
and I saw an auditorium of people

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.752
who, one by one, would approach
the front of that courtroom

00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:18.512
to say two words and two words only:

00:02:18.536 --> 00:02:19.686
"Not guilty."

00:02:20.352 --> 00:02:22.611
They were predominately black and brown.

00:02:24.152 --> 00:02:26.662
And then a judge, a defense
attorney and a prosecutor

00:02:26.686 --> 00:02:30.421
would make life-altering decisions
about that person without their input.

00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:33.281
They were predominately white.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.393
As each person, one by one,
approached the front of that courtroom,

00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:39.995
I couldn't stop but think:

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.170
How did they get here?

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:42.908
I wanted to know their stories.

00:02:43.773 --> 00:02:46.873
And as the prosecutor
read the facts of each case,

00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:49.525
I was thinking to myself,

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.294
we could have predicted that.

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.850
That seems so preventable...

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.734
not because I was an expert
in criminal law,

00:02:57.758 --> 00:02:59.805
but because it was common sense.

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:03.169
Over the course of the internship,

00:03:03.193 --> 00:03:05.347
I began to recognize
people in the auditorium,

00:03:05.371 --> 00:03:07.463
not because they were
criminal masterminds

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.487
but because they were
coming to us for help

00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:11.711
and we were sending them out without any.

00:03:13.774 --> 00:03:17.353
My second year of law school I worked
as a paralegal for a defense attorney,

00:03:17.377 --> 00:03:20.666
and in that experience I met many
young men accused of murder.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.913
Even in our "worst," I saw human stories.

00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:27.518
And they all contained childhood trauma,

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:29.778
victimization, poverty, loss,

00:03:29.802 --> 00:03:31.500
disengagement from school,

00:03:31.524 --> 00:03:34.659
early interaction with the police
and the criminal justice system,

00:03:34.683 --> 00:03:37.389
all leading to a seat in a courtroom.

00:03:37.862 --> 00:03:40.852
Those convicted of murder
were condemned to die in prison,

00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:44.994
and it was during those meetings
with those men that I couldn't fathom

00:03:45.018 --> 00:03:46.805
why we would spend so much money

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.551
to keep this one person in jail
for the next 80 years

00:03:49.575 --> 00:03:51.582
when we could have reinvested it up front,

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:55.084
and perhaps prevented the whole thing
from happening in the first place.

00:03:55.108 --> 00:03:59.242
(Applause)

00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:02.060
My third year of law school,

00:04:02.084 --> 00:04:04.712
I defended people accused
of small street crimes,

00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:05.887
mostly mentally ill,

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:07.062
mostly homeless,

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:08.237
mostly drug-addicted,

00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:09.564
all in need of help.

00:04:11.194 --> 00:04:12.901
They would come to us,

00:04:12.925 --> 00:04:15.241
and we would send them away
without that help.

00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:19.503
They were in need of our assistance.

00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:23.014
But we weren't giving them any.

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:28.066
Prosecuted, adjudged and defended

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.226
by people who knew nothing about them.

00:04:32.493 --> 00:04:35.949
The staggering inefficiency is what
drove me to criminal justice work.

00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:39.326
The unfairness of it all
made me want to be a defender.

00:04:40.382 --> 00:04:43.366
The power dynamic
that I came to understand

00:04:44.156 --> 00:04:45.860
made me become a prosecutor.

00:04:47.383 --> 00:04:50.314
I don't want to spend a lot of time
talking about the problem.

00:04:50.338 --> 00:04:52.678
We know the criminal justice
system needs reform,

00:04:52.702 --> 00:04:55.908
we know there are 2.3 million
people in American jails and prisons,

00:04:55.932 --> 00:04:58.511
making us the most incarcerated
nation on the planet.

00:04:58.535 --> 00:05:01.812
We know there's another seven million
people on probation or parole,

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:04.050
we know that the criminal justice system

00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:06.082
disproportionately affects
people of color,

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:07.730
particularly poor people of color.

00:05:07.754 --> 00:05:10.508
And we know there are system failures
happening everywhere

00:05:10.532 --> 00:05:12.302
that bring people to our courtrooms.

00:05:12.326 --> 00:05:13.588
But what we do not discuss

00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:16.294
is how ill-equipped our prosecutors
are to receive them.

00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:19.175
When we talk about
criminal justice reform,

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.506
we, as a society, focus on three things.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.342
We complain, we tweet, we protest

00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:25.495
about the police, about sentencing laws

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:26.874
and about prison.

00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:32.296
We rarely, if ever, talk
about the prosecutor.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.010
In the fall of 2009,

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:39.761
a young man was arrested
by the Boston Police Department.

00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:42.088
He was 18 years old,
he was African American

00:05:42.112 --> 00:05:44.317
and he was a senior
at a local public school.

00:05:44.706 --> 00:05:46.630
He had his sights set on college

00:05:46.654 --> 00:05:50.378
but his part-time, minimum-wage job
wasn't providing the financial opportunity

00:05:50.402 --> 00:05:51.892
he needed to enroll in school.

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:54.136
In a series of bad decisions,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.765
he stole 30 laptops from a store
and sold them on the Internet.

00:05:58.424 --> 00:05:59.913
This led to his arrest

00:05:59.937 --> 00:06:04.193
and a criminal complaint
of 30 felony charges.

00:06:05.677 --> 00:06:09.225
The potential jail time he faced is what
stressed Christopher out the most.

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:11.343
But what he had little understanding of

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:14.677
was the impact a criminal record
would have on his future.

00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:18.204
I was standing in arraignments that day

00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:20.324
when Christopher's case
came across my desk.

00:06:20.348 --> 00:06:22.864
And at the risk of sounding
dramatic, in that moment,

00:06:22.888 --> 00:06:24.839
I had Christopher's life in my hands.

00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:27.756
I was 29 years old,
a brand-new prosecutor,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.876
and I had little appreciation
for how the decisions I would make

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.486
would impact Christopher's life.

00:06:34.906 --> 00:06:36.722
Christopher's case was a serious one

00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:38.627
and it needed to be dealt with as such,

00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:41.690
but I didn't think branding him
a felon for the rest of his life

00:06:41.714 --> 00:06:42.872
was the right answer.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.663
For the most part,
prosecutors step onto the job

00:06:46.687 --> 00:06:49.338
with little appreciation
of the impact of our decisions,

00:06:49.362 --> 00:06:50.671
regardless of our intent.

00:06:50.695 --> 00:06:52.210
Despite our broad discretion,

00:06:52.234 --> 00:06:55.406
we learn to avoid risk at all cost,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.168
rendering our discretion

00:06:57.192 --> 00:06:58.476
basically useless.

00:06:59.971 --> 00:07:02.363
History has conditioned us
to believe that somehow,

00:07:02.387 --> 00:07:05.174
the criminal justice system
brings about accountability

00:07:05.198 --> 00:07:06.528
and improves public safety,

00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:08.259
despite evidence to the contrary.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.744
We're judged internally and externally
by our convictions and our trial wins,

00:07:12.768 --> 00:07:16.266
so prosecutors aren't really
incentivized to be creative

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.397
at our case dispositions,

00:07:18.421 --> 00:07:21.568
or to take risks on people
we might not otherwise.

00:07:22.666 --> 00:07:24.163
We stick to an outdated method,

00:07:24.187 --> 00:07:27.318
counterproductive to achieving
the very goal that we all want,

00:07:27.342 --> 00:07:29.297
and that's safer communities.

00:07:30.004 --> 00:07:33.815
Yet most prosecutors standing in my space
would have arraigned Christopher.

00:07:34.897 --> 00:07:38.275
They have little appreciation
for what we can do.

00:07:38.299 --> 00:07:41.409
Arraigning Christopher
would give him a criminal record,

00:07:42.426 --> 00:07:44.536
making it harder for him to get a job,

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.709
setting in motion a cycle

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:49.589
that defines the failing
criminal justice system today.

00:07:52.073 --> 00:07:54.058
With a criminal record and without a job,

00:07:54.082 --> 00:07:58.603
Christopher would be unable to find
employment, education or stable housing.

00:07:58.627 --> 00:08:00.746
Without those protective
factors in his life,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.140
Christopher would be more likely
to commit further, more serious crime.

00:08:04.164 --> 00:08:07.289
The more contact Christopher had
with the criminal justice system,

00:08:07.313 --> 00:08:09.857
the more likely it would be
that he would return again

00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:11.850
and again and again --

00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:15.678
all at tremendous social cost
to his children, to his family

00:08:15.702 --> 00:08:16.853
and to his peers.

00:08:16.877 --> 00:08:18.182
And, ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:21.681
it is a terrible public safety
outcome for the rest of us.

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:26.784
When I came out of law school,

00:08:26.808 --> 00:08:29.014
I did the same thing as everybody else.

00:08:29.546 --> 00:08:32.002
I came out as a prosecutor
expected to do justice,

00:08:32.026 --> 00:08:34.529
but I never learned what
justice was in my classes --

00:08:34.553 --> 00:08:35.703
none of us do.

00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:37.353
None of us do.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.447
And yet, prosecutors
are the most powerful actors

00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:43.081
in the criminal justice system.

00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:45.922
Our power is virtually boundless.

00:08:45.946 --> 00:08:47.399
In most cases, not the judge,

00:08:47.423 --> 00:08:49.153
not the police, not the legislature,

00:08:49.177 --> 00:08:51.550
not the mayor, not the governor,
not the President

00:08:51.574 --> 00:08:53.510
can tell us how to prosecute our cases.

00:08:55.006 --> 00:08:58.122
The decision to arraign Christopher
and give him a criminal record

00:08:58.146 --> 00:08:59.375
was exclusively mine.

00:09:00.343 --> 00:09:03.829
I would choose whether to prosecute
him for 30 felonies, for one felony,

00:09:03.853 --> 00:09:05.004
for a misdemeanor,

00:09:05.028 --> 00:09:06.205
or at all.

00:09:06.229 --> 00:09:09.205
I would choose whether to leverage
Christopher into a plea deal

00:09:09.229 --> 00:09:11.258
or take the case to trial, and ultimately,

00:09:11.282 --> 00:09:14.273
I would be in a position to ask
for Christopher to go to jail.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.589
These are decisions that prosecutors
make every day unfettered,

00:09:20.613 --> 00:09:23.422
and we are unaware and untrained

00:09:23.446 --> 00:09:26.360
of the grave consequences
of those decisions.

00:09:28.498 --> 00:09:29.820
One night this past summer,

00:09:29.844 --> 00:09:33.746
I was at a small gathering
of professional men of color

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.357
from around the city.

00:09:35.381 --> 00:09:38.338
As I stood there stuffing
free finger sandwiches into my mouth,

00:09:38.362 --> 00:09:39.845
as you do as public servant --

00:09:39.869 --> 00:09:40.885
(Laughter)

00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:42.472
I noticed across the room,

00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:46.295
a young man waving and smiling
at me and approaching me.

00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:50.551
And I recognized him,
but I couldn't place from where,

00:09:50.575 --> 00:09:54.163
and before I knew it,
this young man was hugging me.

00:09:55.134 --> 00:09:56.521
And thanking me.

00:09:57.766 --> 00:10:00.067
"You cared about me,
and you changed my life."

00:10:01.339 --> 00:10:02.829
It was Christopher.

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:05.522
See, I never arraigned Christopher.

00:10:05.546 --> 00:10:07.146
He never faced a judge or a jail,

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.749
he never had a criminal record.

00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:10.891
Instead, I worked with Christopher;

00:10:10.915 --> 00:10:13.634
first on being accountable
for his actions,

00:10:13.658 --> 00:10:16.747
and then, putting him in a position
where he wouldn't re-offend.

00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:20.618
We recovered 75 percent
of the computers that he sold

00:10:20.642 --> 00:10:22.145
and gave them back to Best Buy,

00:10:22.169 --> 00:10:23.773
and came up with a financial plan

00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:26.012
to repay for the computers
we couldn't recover.

00:10:26.036 --> 00:10:27.751
Christopher did community service.

00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:31.054
He wrote an essay reflecting on how
this case could impact his future

00:10:31.078 --> 00:10:32.429
and that of the community.

00:10:32.453 --> 00:10:33.660
He applied to college,

00:10:33.684 --> 00:10:34.944
he obtained financial aid,

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.529
and he went on to graduate
from a four-year school.

00:10:38.523 --> 00:10:45.007
(Applause)

00:10:45.574 --> 00:10:48.014
After we finished hugging,
I looked at his name tag,

00:10:48.038 --> 00:10:51.287
to learn that Christopher was the manager
of a large bank in Boston.

00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:54.611
Christopher had accomplished --
and making a lot more money than me --

00:10:54.635 --> 00:10:55.636
(Laughter)

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.166
He had accomplished all of this

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.285
in the six years since I had first
seen him in Roxbury Court.

00:11:00.909 --> 00:11:03.976
I can't take credit for Christopher's
journey to success,

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:07.889
but I certainly did my part
to keep him on the path.

00:11:08.992 --> 00:11:12.071
There are thousands
of Christophers out there,

00:11:12.593 --> 00:11:14.374
some locked in our jails and prisons.

00:11:14.398 --> 00:11:16.263
We need thousands of prosecutors

00:11:16.287 --> 00:11:19.111
to recognize that and to protect them.

00:11:20.508 --> 00:11:24.024
An employed Christopher is better
for public safety than a condemned one.

00:11:24.462 --> 00:11:27.105
It's a bigger win for all of us.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:31.519
In retrospect, the decision not
to throw the book at Christopher

00:11:31.543 --> 00:11:32.694
makes perfect sense.

00:11:32.718 --> 00:11:34.930
When I saw him that first day
in Roxbury Court,

00:11:34.954 --> 00:11:36.826
I didn't see a criminal standing there.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.645
I saw myself -- a young person
in need of intervention.

00:11:39.669 --> 00:11:43.982
As an individual caught selling a large
quantity of drugs in my late teens,

00:11:44.006 --> 00:11:46.931
I knew firsthand the power of opportunity

00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:49.841
as opposed to the wrath
of the criminal justice system.

00:11:52.341 --> 00:11:56.252
Along the way, with the help
and guidance of my district attorney,

00:11:56.276 --> 00:11:59.249
my supervisor and judges,

00:11:59.273 --> 00:12:01.800
I learned the power of the prosecutor

00:12:01.824 --> 00:12:04.546
to change lives instead of ruining them.

00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:08.179
And that's how we do it in Boston.

00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:12.751
We helped a woman who was arrested
for stealing groceries to feed her kids

00:12:12.775 --> 00:12:13.925
get a job.

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:17.549
Instead of putting an abused
teenager in adult jail

00:12:17.573 --> 00:12:19.026
for punching another teenager,

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.940
we secured mental health treatment
and community supervision.

00:12:22.288 --> 00:12:23.935
A runaway girl who was arrested

00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:26.062
for prostituting, to survive
on the streets,

00:12:26.086 --> 00:12:28.827
needed a safe place to live and grow --

00:12:28.851 --> 00:12:30.854
something we could help her with.

00:12:30.878 --> 00:12:32.354
I even helped a young man

00:12:32.378 --> 00:12:35.481
who was so afraid of the older gang kids
showing up after school,

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:38.180
that one morning instead
of a lunchbox into his backpack,

00:12:38.204 --> 00:12:39.829
he put a loaded 9-millimeter.

00:12:41.467 --> 00:12:45.503
We would spend our time that we'd
normally take prepping our cases

00:12:45.527 --> 00:12:47.694
for months and months
for trial down the road

00:12:47.718 --> 00:12:51.619
by coming up with real solutions
to the problems as they presented.

00:12:52.699 --> 00:12:54.985
Which is the better way to spend our time?

00:12:55.969 --> 00:12:58.703
How would you prefer
your prosecutors to spend theirs?

00:12:59.901 --> 00:13:02.269
Why are we spending 80 billion dollars

00:13:02.293 --> 00:13:04.735
on a prison industry
that we know is failing,

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:08.323
when we could take that money
and reallocate it into education,

00:13:08.347 --> 00:13:09.756
into mental health treatment,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.277
into substance abuse treatment

00:13:11.301 --> 00:13:14.359
and to community investment
so we can develop our neighborhoods?

00:13:14.383 --> 00:13:20.899
(Applause)

00:13:21.616 --> 00:13:23.220
So why should this matter to you?

00:13:23.244 --> 00:13:26.362
Well, one, we're spending a lot of money.

00:13:27.294 --> 00:13:28.531
Our money.

00:13:29.063 --> 00:13:31.469
It costs 109,000 dollars in some states

00:13:31.493 --> 00:13:33.083
to lock up a teenager for a year,

00:13:33.107 --> 00:13:37.559
with a 60 percent chance that that person
will return to the very same system.

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:41.006
That is a terrible return on investment.

00:13:42.706 --> 00:13:44.980
Number two: it's the right thing to do.

00:13:45.004 --> 00:13:47.959
If prosecutors were a part
of creating the problem,

00:13:47.983 --> 00:13:50.212
it's incumbent on us to create a solution

00:13:50.236 --> 00:13:52.283
and we can do that using other disciplines

00:13:52.307 --> 00:13:54.823
that have already done the data
and research for us.

00:13:54.847 --> 00:13:56.016
And number three:

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.641
your voice and your vote
can make that happen.

00:13:58.665 --> 00:14:01.345
The next time there's a local
district attorney's election

00:14:01.369 --> 00:14:02.521
in your jurisdiction,

00:14:02.545 --> 00:14:04.039
ask candidates these questions.

00:14:04.063 --> 00:14:07.250
One: What are you doing to make
me and my neighbors safer?

00:14:07.274 --> 00:14:09.654
Two: What data are you collecting,

00:14:09.678 --> 00:14:11.899
and how are you training your prosecutors

00:14:11.923 --> 00:14:13.594
to make sure that it's working?

00:14:13.618 --> 00:14:14.783
And number three:

00:14:14.807 --> 00:14:16.663
If it's not working for everybody,

00:14:16.687 --> 00:14:18.241
what are you doing to fix it?

00:14:18.562 --> 00:14:20.274
If they can't answer the questions,

00:14:20.298 --> 00:14:22.185
they shouldn't be doing the job.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.697
Each one of you that raised your hand
at the beginning of this talk

00:14:26.721 --> 00:14:30.159
is a living, breathing example
of the power of opportunity,

00:14:30.183 --> 00:14:31.334
of intervention,

00:14:31.358 --> 00:14:32.509
of support

00:14:32.533 --> 00:14:33.814
and of love.

00:14:33.838 --> 00:14:36.739
While each of you may have faced
your own brand of discipline

00:14:36.763 --> 00:14:38.876
for whatever malfeasances you committed,

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.765
barely any of you needed a day in jail

00:14:40.789 --> 00:14:42.868
to make you the people
that you are today --

00:14:42.892 --> 00:14:44.954
some of the greatest minds on the planet.

00:14:45.748 --> 00:14:47.627
Every day, thousands of times a day,

00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:50.597
prosecutors around the United States
wield power so great

00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:52.361
that it can bring about catastrophe

00:14:52.385 --> 00:14:54.963
as quickly as it can
bring about opportunity,

00:14:54.987 --> 00:14:56.219
intervention,

00:14:56.243 --> 00:14:57.402
support

00:14:57.426 --> 00:14:59.544
and yes, even love.

00:15:00.758 --> 00:15:03.664
Those qualities are the hallmarks
of a strong community,

00:15:03.688 --> 00:15:05.482
and a strong community is a safe one.

00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:06.962
If our communities are broken,

00:15:06.986 --> 00:15:09.083
don't let the lawyers
that you elect fix them

00:15:09.107 --> 00:15:11.290
with outdated, inefficient,
expensive methods.

00:15:11.314 --> 00:15:14.957
Demand more; vote for the prosecutor
who's helping people stay out of jail,

00:15:14.981 --> 00:15:16.133
not putting them in.

00:15:16.157 --> 00:15:17.308
Demand better.

00:15:17.332 --> 00:15:19.338
You deserve it, your children deserve it,

00:15:19.362 --> 00:15:21.800
the people who are tied up
in the system deserve it,

00:15:21.824 --> 00:15:22.976
but most of all,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.247
the people that we are sworn to protect
and do justice for demand it.

00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:27.422
We must,

00:15:27.446 --> 00:15:28.828
we must do better.

00:15:28.852 --> 00:15:30.009
Thank you.

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:32.010
(Applause)

00:15:34.549 --> 00:15:35.988
Thank you.

00:15:36.012 --> 00:15:38.218
(Applause)

00:15:39.213 --> 00:15:41.489
Thank you very much.
