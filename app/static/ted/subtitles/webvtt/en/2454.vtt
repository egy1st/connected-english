00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.816
In India, we have these huge families.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.416
I bet a lot of you all
must have heard about it.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.280
Which means that there are
a lot of family events.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.720
So as a child, my parents
used to drag me to these family events.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.376
But the one thing
that I always looked forward to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.440
was playing around with my cousins.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.456
And there was always this one uncle

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.736
who used to be there,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.616
always ready, jumping around with us,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.136
having games for us,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.960
making us kids have the time of our lives.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.256
This man was extremely successful:

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.280
he was confident and powerful.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.320
But then I saw this hale and hearty person
deteriorate in health.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.520
He was diagnosed with Parkinson's.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.816
Parkinson's is a disease that causes
degeneration of the nervous system,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.816
which means that this person
who used to be independent

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.080
suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee,
because of tremors, much more difficult.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.456
My uncle started using a walker to walk,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.696
and to take a turn,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.776
he literally had to take
one step at a time, like this,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.040
and it took forever.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.416
So this person, who used to be
the center of attention

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.496
in every family gathering,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.600
was suddenly hiding behind people.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.760
He was hiding from the pitiful look
in people's eyes.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.520
And he's not the only one in the world.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.776
Every year, 60,000 people
are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.840
and this number is only rising.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.776
As designers, we dream that our designs
solve these multifaceted problems,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.616
one solution that solves it all,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.920
but it need not always be like that.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.496
You can also target simple problems

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.440
and create small solutions for them
and eventually make a big impact.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.496
So my aim here was
to not cure Parkinson's,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.696
but to make their everyday tasks
much more simple,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.120
and then make an impact.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.600
Well, the first thing I targeted
was tremors, right?

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.976
My uncle told me that he had stopped
drinking coffee or tea in public

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.479
just out of embarrassment,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.480
so, well, I designed the no-spill cup.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.936
It works just purely on its form.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.216
The curve on top deflects the liquid
back inside every time they have tremors,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.080
and this keeps the liquid inside
compared to a normal cup.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.720
But the key here is that it is not tagged
as a Parkinson's patient product.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.456
It looks like a cup that could be used
by you, me, any clumsy person,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.480
and that makes it much more comforting
for them to use, to blend in.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.576
So, well, one problem solved,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.840
many more to go.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.056
All this while, I was interviewing him,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.616
questioning him,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.336
and then I realized that I was getting
very superficial information,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.176
or just answers to my questions.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.360
But I really needed to dig deeper
to get a new perspective.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.736
So I thought, well,
let's observe him in his daily tasks,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.120
while he's eating, while he's watching TV.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.856
And then, when I was actually
observing him walking to his dining table,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.056
it struck me, this man who finds it
so difficult to walk on flat land,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.800
how does he climb a staircase?

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.016
Because in India we do not have
a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.056
like in the developed countries.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.200
One actually has to climb the stairs.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.176
So he told me,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.200
"Well, let me show you how I do it."

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.920
Let's take a look at what I saw.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.616
So he took really long
to reach this position,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.496
and then all this while, I'm thinking,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.456
"Oh my God, is he really going to do it?

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.376
Is he really, really going to do it
without his walker?"

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.600
And then ...

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.600
(Laughter)

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.840
And the turns, he took them so easily.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.480
So -- shocked?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.400
Well, I was too.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.296
So this person who could not
walk on flat land

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.400
was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.375
On researching this, I realized that
it's because it's a continuous motion.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.536
There's this other man
who also suffers from the same symptoms

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.976
and uses a walker,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.096
but the moment he's put on a cycle,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.816
all his symptoms vanish,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.920
because it is a continuous motion.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.856
So the key for me was to translate
this feeling of walking on a staircase

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.280
back to flat land.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.816
And a lot of ideas
were tested and tried on him,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.360
but the one that finally worked
was this one. Let's take a look.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.496
(Laughter)

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.976
(Applause)

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.456
He walked faster, right?

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.680
(Applause)

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.016
I call this the staircase illusion,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.616
and actually when the staircase illusion
abruptly ended, he froze,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.656
and this is called freezing of gait.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.896
So it happens a lot,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.856
so why not have a staircase illusion
flowing through all their rooms,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.240
making them feel much more confident?

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.096
You know, technology is not always it.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.896
What we need are human-centered solutions.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.136
I could have easily
made it into a projection,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.496
or a Google Glass, or something like that.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.840
But I stuck to simple print on the floor.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.296
This print could be taken into hospitals

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.720
to make them feel much more welcome.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.696
What I wish to do
is make every Parkinson's patient

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.176
feel like my uncle felt that day.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.880
He told me that I made him feel
like his old self again.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.120
"Smart" in today's world
has become synonymous to high tech,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.120
and the world is only getting
smarter and smarter day by day.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.480
But why can't smart be something
that's simple and yet effective?

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.296
All we need is a little bit of empathy
and some curiosity,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.576
to go out there, observe.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.496
But let's not stop at that.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.176
Let's find these complex problems.
Don't be scared of them.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.776
Break them, boil them down
into much smaller problems,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.296
and then find simple solutions for them.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.336
Test these solutions, fail if needed,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.520
but with newer insights to make it better.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.496
Imagine what we all could do
if we all came up with simple solutions.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.000
What would the world be like
if we combined all our simple solutions?

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.896
Let's make a smarter world,
but with simplicity.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.136
Thank you.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.200
(Applause)
