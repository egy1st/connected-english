00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.880
So, this is a story

00:00:02.904 --> 00:00:04.833
about how we know what we know.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.825
It's a story about this woman,

00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:10.547
Natalia Rybczynski.

00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:12.960
She's a paleobiologist,

00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:16.813
which means she specializes
in digging up really old dead stuff.

00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:20.339
(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah,
I had someone call me "Dr. Dead Things."

00:00:20.363 --> 00:00:22.992
Latif Nasser: And I think
she's particularly interesting

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:24.930
because of where she digs that stuff up,

00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:29.149
way above the Arctic Circle
in the remote Canadian tundra.

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:32.956
Now, one summer day in 2006,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.171
she was at a dig site called
the Fyles Leaf Bed,

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:40.773
which is less than 10 degrees latitude
away from the magnetic north pole.

00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:43.524
(Audio) NR: Really, it's not
going to sound very exciting,

00:00:43.548 --> 00:00:47.578
because it was a day of walking
with your backpack and your GPS

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:51.680
and notebook and just picking up
anything that might be a fossil.

00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:54.379
LN: And at some point,
she noticed something.

00:00:54.403 --> 00:00:56.570
(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored,

00:00:56.594 --> 00:00:58.529
about the size of the palm of my hand.

00:00:58.553 --> 00:01:00.847
It was just lying on the surface.

00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:04.323
LN: And at first she thought
it was just a splinter of wood,

00:01:04.347 --> 00:01:06.640
because that's the sort of thing
people had found

00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:10.083
at the Fyles Leaf Bed before --
prehistoric plant parts.

00:01:10.107 --> 00:01:12.575
But that night, back at camp ...

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.869
(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens,

00:01:14.893 --> 00:01:17.290
I'm looking a little bit
more closely and realizing

00:01:17.314 --> 00:01:19.718
it doesn't quite look
like this has tree rings.

00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:21.306
Maybe it's a preservation thing,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.604
but it looks really like ...

00:01:23.628 --> 00:01:24.829
bone.

00:01:24.853 --> 00:01:27.742
LN: Huh. So over the next four years,

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.700
she went to that spot over and over,

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:36.260
and eventually collected 30 fragments
of that exact same bone,

00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:37.945
most of them really tiny.

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:42.958
(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot.
It fits in a small Ziploc bag.

00:01:42.982 --> 00:01:46.339
LN: And she tried to piece them
together like a jigsaw puzzle.

00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:48.386
But it was challenging.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.230
(Audio) NR: It's broken up
into so many little tiny pieces,

00:01:51.254 --> 00:01:55.512
I'm trying to use sand and putty,
and it's not looking good.

00:01:55.536 --> 00:02:00.703
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:02.316
LN: Ooh!
NR: Yeah, right?

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.780
(Laughter)

00:02:03.804 --> 00:02:06.547
LN: It turns out it was way easier
to do it virtually.

00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:09.341
(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical
when it all fits together.

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:11.564
LN: How certain were you
that you had it right,

00:02:11.588 --> 00:02:13.733
that you had put it together
in the right way?

00:02:13.757 --> 00:02:16.771
Was there a potential that you'd
put it together a different way

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:18.737
and have, like, a parakeet or something?

00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:20.126
(Laughter)

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.790
(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no.
No, we got this.

00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:28.083
LN: What she had, she discovered,
was a tibia, a leg bone,

00:02:28.107 --> 00:02:32.107
and specifically, one that belonged
to a cloven-hoofed mammal,

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:34.980
so something like a cow or a sheep.

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.464
But it couldn't have been either of those.

00:02:37.488 --> 00:02:39.271
It was just too big.

00:02:39.822 --> 00:02:43.886
(Audio) NR: The size of this thing,
it was huge. It's a really big animal.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.768
LN: So what animal could it be?

00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:49.871
Having hit a wall, she showed
one of the fragments

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:52.467
to some colleagues of hers in Colorado,

00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:53.751
and they had an idea.

00:02:54.244 --> 00:02:59.291
(Audio) NR: We took a saw,
and we nicked just the edge of it,

00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:05.706
and there was this really interesting
smell that comes from it.

00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:09.284
LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.

00:03:09.308 --> 00:03:11.941
It was a smell that Natalia recognized

00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:15.908
from cutting up skulls
in her gross anatomy lab:

00:03:15.932 --> 00:03:17.096
collagen.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.777
Collagen is what gives
structure to our bones.

00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:21.959
And usually, after so many years,

00:03:21.983 --> 00:03:23.134
it breaks down.

00:03:23.158 --> 00:03:27.506
But in this case, the Arctic had acted
like a natural freezer and preserved it.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.813
Then a year or two later,
Natalia was at a conference in Bristol,

00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:35.031
and she saw that a colleague
of hers named Mike Buckley

00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:40.895
was demoing this new process
that he called "collagen fingerprinting."

00:03:41.284 --> 00:03:44.927
It turns out that different species
have slightly different structures

00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:46.103
of collagen,

00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:48.943
so if you get a collagen profile
of an unknown bone,

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:51.161
you can compare it
to those of known species,

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:53.723
and, who knows, maybe you get a match.

00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:57.825
So she shipped him one of the fragments,

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.143
FedEx.

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:02.977
(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it.
It's kind of important.

00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:04.254
(Laughter)

00:04:04.278 --> 00:04:05.469
LN: And he processed it,

00:04:05.493 --> 00:04:09.855
and compared it to 37 known
and modern-day mammal species.

00:04:10.674 --> 00:04:11.951
And he found a match.

00:04:12.824 --> 00:04:17.436
It turns out that
the 3.5 million-year-old bone

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.090
that Natalia had dug
out of the High Arctic

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:22.923
belonged to ...

00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:25.348
a camel.

00:04:25.372 --> 00:04:27.103
(Laughter)

00:04:27.127 --> 00:04:31.425
(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what?
That's amazing -- if it's true.

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.501
LN: So they tested
a bunch of the fragments,

00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:35.769
and they got the same result for each one.

00:04:36.197 --> 00:04:41.617
However, based on the size
of the bone that they found,

00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:48.004
it meant that this camel was 30 percent
larger than modern-day camels.

00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:51.218
So this camel would have been
about nine feet tall,

00:04:51.242 --> 00:04:52.440
weighed around a ton.

00:04:52.464 --> 00:04:53.515
(Audience reacts)

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:54.588
Yeah.

00:04:54.612 --> 00:04:58.105
Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.271
(Laughter)

00:05:02.396 --> 00:05:04.714
Now, when you hear the word "camel,"

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:08.663
what may come to mind is one of these,

00:05:09.507 --> 00:05:12.871
the Bactrian camel
of East and Central Asia.

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.380
But chances are the postcard image
you have in your brain

00:05:16.404 --> 00:05:19.959
is one of these, the dromedary,

00:05:19.983 --> 00:05:22.411
quintessential desert creature --

00:05:22.435 --> 00:05:26.754
hangs out in sandy, hot places
like the Middle East and the Sahara,

00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:28.258
has a big old hump on its back

00:05:28.282 --> 00:05:30.799
for storing water
for those long desert treks,

00:05:30.823 --> 00:05:34.204
has big, broad feet to help it
tromp over sand dunes.

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:40.930
So how on earth would one of these guys
end up in the High Arctic?

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.506
Well, scientists have known
for a long time, turns out,

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.092
even before Natalia's discovery,

00:05:47.116 --> 00:05:52.734
that camels are actually
originally American.

00:05:52.758 --> 00:05:58.458
(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)

00:05:58.482 --> 00:05:59.941
(Laughter)

00:05:59.965 --> 00:06:01.496
They started here.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.354
For nearly 40 of the 45 million years
that camels have been around,

00:06:06.378 --> 00:06:09.537
you could only find them in North America,

00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:12.814
around 20 different species, maybe more.

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:16.083
(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup,
would they look different?

00:06:16.107 --> 00:06:18.542
NR: Yeah, you're going to have
different body sizes.

00:06:18.566 --> 00:06:20.478
You'll have some with really long necks,

00:06:20.502 --> 00:06:22.747
so they're actually
functionally like giraffes.

00:06:23.345 --> 00:06:26.417
LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.

00:06:26.441 --> 00:06:30.025
(Audio) NR: The really primitive,
early ones would have been really small,

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:32.552
almost like rabbits.

00:06:32.576 --> 00:06:35.423
LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?

00:06:35.447 --> 00:06:36.884
(Audio) NR: The earliest ones.

00:06:36.908 --> 00:06:39.143
So those ones you probably
would not recognize.

00:06:39.167 --> 00:06:41.357
LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.

00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:43.425
(Audio) NR: I know,
wouldn't that be great?

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:44.621
(Laughter)

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:47.304
LN: And then about three
to seven million years ago,

00:06:47.328 --> 00:06:50.136
one branch of camels
went down to South America,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.114
where they became llamas and alpacas,

00:06:53.138 --> 00:06:56.060
and another branch crossed over
the Bering Land Bridge

00:06:56.084 --> 00:06:57.520
into Asia and Africa.

00:06:57.544 --> 00:06:59.965
And then around the end
of the last ice age,

00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:03.088
North American camels went extinct.

00:07:03.893 --> 00:07:06.313
So, scientists knew all of that already,

00:07:06.337 --> 00:07:12.413
but it still doesn't fully explain
how Natalia found one so far north.

00:07:12.437 --> 00:07:17.111
Like, this is, temperature-wise,
the polar opposite of the Sahara.

00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:19.636
Now to be fair,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.343
three and a half million years ago,

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:25.466
it was on average 22 degrees Celsius
warmer than it is now.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.425
So it would have been boreal forest,

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:32.363
so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.

00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:36.559
But still, like, they would have
six-month-long winters

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:38.806
where the ponds would freeze over.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.298
You'd have blizzards.

00:07:40.322 --> 00:07:43.933
You'd have 24 hours a day
of straight darkness.

00:07:43.957 --> 00:07:46.938
Like, how ... How?

00:07:46.962 --> 00:07:51.120
How is it that one of these
Saharan superstars

00:07:51.144 --> 00:07:54.375
could ever have survived
those arctic conditions?

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:57.375
(Laughter)

00:07:57.399 --> 00:08:01.087
Natalia and her colleagues
think they have an answer.

00:08:01.632 --> 00:08:03.642
And it's kind of brilliant.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:11.233
What if the very features that we imagine
make the camel so well-suited

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:13.225
to places like the Sahara,

00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:16.661
actually evolved to help it
get through the winter?

00:08:17.448 --> 00:08:22.145
What if those broad feet were meant
to tromp not over sand,

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:25.189
but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:28.593
What if that hump --
which, huge news to me,

00:08:28.617 --> 00:08:30.991
does not contain water, it contains fat --

00:08:31.015 --> 00:08:32.594
(Laughter)

00:08:32.618 --> 00:08:36.219
was there to help the camel
get through that six-month-long winter,

00:08:36.243 --> 00:08:37.920
when food was scarce?

00:08:37.944 --> 00:08:41.657
And then, only later, long after
it crossed over the land bridge

00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:46.099
did it retrofit those winter features
for a hot desert environment?

00:08:46.123 --> 00:08:50.197
Like, for instance, the hump
may be helpful to camels in hotter climes

00:08:50.221 --> 00:08:52.693
because having all your fat in one place,

00:08:52.717 --> 00:08:55.458
like a, you know, fat backpack,

00:08:55.482 --> 00:08:58.010
means that you don't have
to have that insulation

00:08:58.034 --> 00:08:59.793
all over the rest of your body.

00:08:59.817 --> 00:09:02.067
So it helps heat dissipate easier.

00:09:02.555 --> 00:09:05.396
It's this crazy idea,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.967
that what seems like proof of the camel's
quintessential desert nature

00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:14.691
could actually be proof
of its High Arctic past.

00:09:15.832 --> 00:09:19.542
Now, I'm not the first person
to tell this story.

00:09:19.566 --> 00:09:24.516
Others have told it as a way
to marvel at evolutionary biology

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.893
or as a keyhole into the future
of climate change.

00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:31.092
But I love it for a totally
different reason.

00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:34.513
For me, it's a story about us,

00:09:34.537 --> 00:09:36.505
about how we see the world

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:38.833
and about how that changes.

00:09:39.658 --> 00:09:43.030
So I was trained as a historian.

00:09:43.054 --> 00:09:47.307
And I've learned that, actually,
a lot of scientists are historians, too.

00:09:47.331 --> 00:09:48.880
They make sense of the past.

00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:54.229
They tell the history of our universe,
of our planet, of life on this planet.

00:09:54.741 --> 00:09:56.218
And as a historian,

00:09:56.242 --> 00:10:00.613
you start with an idea in your mind
of how the story goes.

00:10:01.196 --> 00:10:03.681
(Audio) NR: We make up stories
and we stick with it,

00:10:03.705 --> 00:10:05.427
like the camel in the desert, right?

00:10:05.451 --> 00:10:07.897
That's a great story!
It's totally adapted for that.

00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:10.150
Clearly, it always lived there.

00:10:10.174 --> 00:10:14.476
LN: But at any moment, you could
uncover some tiny bit of evidence.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.699
You could learn some tiny thing

00:10:16.723 --> 00:10:20.682
that forces you to reframe
everything you thought you knew.

00:10:20.706 --> 00:10:24.484
Like, in this case, this one scientist
finds this one shard

00:10:24.508 --> 00:10:26.255
of what she thought was wood,

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:31.317
and because of that, science has a totally
new and totally counterintuitive theory

00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:34.956
about why this absurd
Dr. Seuss-looking creature

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.512
looks the way it does.

00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:41.940
And for me, it completely upended
the way I think of the camel.

00:10:41.964 --> 00:10:46.346
It went from being
this ridiculously niche creature

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.719
suited only to this
one specific environment,

00:10:48.743 --> 00:10:54.031
to being this world traveler
that just happens to be in the Sahara,

00:10:54.055 --> 00:10:57.180
and could end up virtually anywhere.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:03.855
(Applause)

00:11:14.396 --> 00:11:15.854
This is Azuri.

00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:19.469
Azuri, hi, how are you doing?

00:11:19.493 --> 00:11:22.041
OK, here, I've got
one of these for you here.

00:11:22.065 --> 00:11:24.111
(Laughter)

00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:28.318
So Azuri is on a break
from her regular gig

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:30.565
at the Radio City Music Hall.

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:32.738
(Laughter)

00:11:32.762 --> 00:11:34.344
That's not even a joke.

00:11:34.717 --> 00:11:36.454
Anyway --

00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:40.835
But really, Azuri is here
as a living reminder

00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:45.106
that the story of our world
is a dynamic one.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.837
It requires our willingness
to readjust, to reimagine.

00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:54.138
(Laughter)

00:11:54.162 --> 00:11:55.613
Right, Azuri?

00:11:55.637 --> 00:12:02.053
And, really, that we're all
just one shard of bone away

00:12:02.077 --> 00:12:04.307
from seeing the world anew.

00:12:04.926 --> 00:12:06.086
Thank you very much.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:12.531
(Applause)
