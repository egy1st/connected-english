00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.296
I come from one of the most liberal,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.536
tolerant, progressive places
in the United States,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.760
Seattle, Washington.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.376
And I grew up with a family
of great Seattlites.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.216
My mother was an artist,
my father was a college professor,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.776
and I am truly grateful for my upbringing,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.296
because I always felt completely
comfortable designing my life

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.280
exactly as I saw fit.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.336
And in point of fact,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.456
I took a route that was not exactly
what my parents had in mind.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.400
When I was 19, I dropped out of college --

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.176
dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560
(Laughter)

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.936
And I went on the road
as a professional French horn player,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.656
which was my lifelong dream.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.576
I played chamber music
all over the United States and Europe,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.376
and I toured for a couple of years

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.376
with a great jazz guitar player
named Charlie Bird.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.976
And by the end of my 20s,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.176
I wound up as a member of the Barcelona
Symphony Orchestra in Spain.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.416
What a great life.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.016
And you know, my parents never complained.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.016
They supported me all the way through it.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.936
It wasn't their dream.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.103
They used to tell
their neighbors and friends,

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:14.176
"Our son, he's taking a gap decade."

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.040
(Laughter)

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.776
And --

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.696
There was, however, one awkward
conversation about my lifestyle

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.176
that I want to tell you about.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.976
I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.696
and I was visiting
my parents for Christmas,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.400
and I was cooking dinner with my mother,
and we were alone in the kitchen.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.056
And she was quiet, too quiet.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.536
Something was wrong.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.080
And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.016
And she said, "Your dad and I
are really worried about you."

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.936
And I said, "What?"
I mean, what could it be, at this point?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.760
And she said, "I want you to be
completely honest with me:

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.616
have you been voting for Republicans?"

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.840
(Laughter)

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.056
Now, the truth is,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.456
I wasn't really political,
I was just a French horn player.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.015
But I had a bit of an epiphany,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.896
and they had detected it,
and it was causing some confusion.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.600
You see, I had become
an enthusiast for capitalism,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.816
and I want to tell you why that is.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.976
It stems from a lifelong interest of mine

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.960
in, believe it or not, poverty.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.256
See, when I was a kid
growing up in Seattle,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.896
I remember the first time
I saw real poverty.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.296
We were a lower middle class family,
but that's of course not real poverty.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.056
That's not even close.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.496
The first time I saw poverty,
and poverty's face,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.336
was when I was six
or seven years old, early 1970s.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.896
And it was like a lot of you,
kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.296
It was a picture in the National
Geographic Magazine

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.616
of a kid who was my age in East Africa,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.216
and there were flies on his face
and a distended belly.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.160
And he wasn't going to make it,
and I knew that, and I was helpless.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.696
Some of you remember that picture,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.736
not exactly that picture,
one just like it.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.560
It introduced the West
to grinding poverty around the world.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.016
Well, that vision kind of haunted me
as I grew up and I went to school

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.816
and I dropped out and dropped in

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.800
and started my family.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:27.496
And I wondered, what happened to that kid?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.200
Or to people just like him
all over the world?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.976
And so I started to study,
even though I wasn't in college,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.416
I was looking for the answer:

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.536
what happened to the world's
poorest people?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.816
Has it gotten worse?
Has it gotten better? What?

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.616
And I found the answer,
and it changed my life,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.200
and I want to share it with you.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.240
See --

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.016
most Americans believe
that poverty has gotten worse

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.176
since we were children,
since they saw that vision.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.856
If you ask Americans, "Has poverty
gotten worse or better around the world?",

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.216
70 percent will say that hunger
has gotten worse since the early 1970s.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.736
But here's the truth.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.456
Here's the epiphany that I had
that changed my thinking.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.240
From 1970 until today,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.736
the percentage of the world's population

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.776
living in starvation levels,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.456
living on a dollar a day or less,
obviously adjusted for inflation,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.696
that percentage has declined

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.400
by 80 percent.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.056
There's been an 80 percent decline
in the world's worst poverty

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.296
since I was a kid.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.896
And I didn't even know about it.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.800
This, my friends, that's a miracle.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.616
That's something we ought to celebrate.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.896
It's the greatest antipoverty achievement
in the history of mankind,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.456
and it happened in our lifetimes.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.016
(Applause)

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.896
So when I learned this, I asked,
what did that? What made it possible?

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.736
Because if you don't know why,
you can't do it again.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.096
If you want to replicate it

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.656
and get the next two billion
people out of poverty,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.456
because that's what we're talking about:
since I was a kid,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.296
two billion of the least of these,
our brothers and sisters,

00:05:03.316 --> 00:05:04.856
have been pulled out of poverty.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.366
I want the next two billion,
so I've got to know why.

00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:09.016
And I went in search of an answer.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.696
And it wasn't a political answer,
because I didn't care.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.376
You know what, I still don't care.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.216
I wanted the best answer
from mainstream economists

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.360
left, right and center.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.080
And here it is.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.816
Here are the reasons.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.576
There are five reasons that two billion
of our brothers and sisters

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.976
have been pulled out of poverty
since I was a kid.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.520
Number one: globalization.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.176
Number two: free trade.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.536
Number three: property rights.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.096
Number four: rule of law.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.096
Number five: entrepreneurship.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.376
It was the free enterprise system
spreading around the world

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.176
after 1970 that did that.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.616
Now, I'm not naive.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.096
I know that free enterprise isn't perfect,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.256
and I know that free enterprise
isn't everything we need

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.496
to build a better world.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.056
But that is great.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.416
And that's beyond politics.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.536
Here's what I learned.
This is the epiphany.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.576
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.136
At its best, it's about aspiration,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.856
which is what so many people
on this stage talk about,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.096
is the aspiration that comes from dreams

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.376
that are embedded
in the free enterprise system.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.576
And we've got to share it
with more people.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.816
Now, I want to tell you
about a second epiphany

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.336
that's related to that first one

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.416
that I think can bring us progress,
not just around the world,

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.680
but right here at home.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.856
The best quote I've ever heard

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.456
to summarize the thoughts
that I've just given you

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.536
about pulling people out of poverty

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.656
is as follows:

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.536
"Free markets have created more wealth
than any system in history.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.360
They have lifted billions out of poverty."

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.656
Who said it?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.080
It sounds like Milton Friedman
or Ronald Reagan.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.000
Wrong.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.720
President Barack Obama said that.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.040
Why do I know it by heart?

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.400
Because he said it to me.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.136
Crazy.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.840
And I said, "Hallelujah."

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.296
But more than that, I said,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.016
"What an opportunity."

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.536
You know what I was thinking?

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.016
It was at an event
that we were doing on the subject

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.976
at Georgetown University in May of 2015.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.776
And I thought, this is the solution

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.296
to the biggest problem
facing America today. What?

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.096
It's coming together around these ideas,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.856
liberals and conservatives,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.960
to help people who need us the most.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.776
Now, I don't have to tell anybody
in this room that we're in a crisis,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.376
in America and many countries around
the world with political polarization.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.296
It's risen to critical, crisis levels.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.720
It's unpleasant. It's not right.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.976
There was an article last year

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.616
in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.120
which is one of the most
prestigious scientific journals

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.336
published in the West.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.816
And it was an article in 2014

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.256
on political motive asymmetry.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.995
What's that? That's what psychologists
call the phenomenon

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:08.939
of assuming that your ideology
is based in love

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.320
but your opponents' ideology
is based in hate.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.736
It's common in world conflict.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.800
You expect to see this between
Palestinians and Israelis, for example.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.816
What the authors of this article found

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.456
was that in America today,
a majority of Republicans and Democrats

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.056
suffer from political motive asymmetry.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.936
A majority of people in our country today
who are politically active believe

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.376
that they are motivated by love
but the other side is motivated by hate.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.936
Think about it. Think about it.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.135
Most people are walking around saying,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.336
"You know, my ideology
is based on basic benevolence,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.576
I want to help people,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.400
but the other guys,
they're evil and out to get me."

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.496
You can't progress as a society
when you have this kind of asymmetry.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.720
It's impossible.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.816
How do we solve it?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.496
Well, first, let's be honest:
there are differences.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.216
Let's not minimize the differences.
That would be really naïve.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.296
There's a lot of good research on this.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.456
A veteran of the TED stage
is my friend Jonathan Haidt.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.536
He's a psychology professor
at New York University.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.496
He does work on the ideology
and values and morals of different people

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.760
to see how they differ.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.170
And he's shown, for example,
that conservatives and liberals

00:09:23.194 --> 00:09:26.210
have a very different emphasis
on what they think is important.

00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:29.536
For example, Jon Haidt has shown

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.536
that liberals care about poverty

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.440
59 percent more than they care
about economic liberty.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.776
And conservatives
care about economic liberty

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.960
28 percent more
than they care about poverty.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.976
Irreconcilable differences, right?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
We'll never come together. Wrong.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.896
That is diversity
in which lies our strength.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.056
Remember what pulled up the poor.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.136
It was the obsession with poverty,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.376
accompanied by the method
of economic freedom

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.016
spreading around the world.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.576
We need each other, in other words,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.220
if we want to help people and get the next
two billion people out of poverty.

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:11.524
There's no other way.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.896
Hmm.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.400
How are we going to get that?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.016
It's a tricky thing, isn't it.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.256
We need innovative thinking.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.936
A lot of it's on this stage.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.120
Social entrepreneurship.
Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.616
We need investment overseas

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.016
in a sustainable, responsible,
ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.856
But you know what we really need?

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.496
We need a new day in flexible ideology.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.080
We need to be less predictable.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.896
Don't we?

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.496
Do you ever feel like your own ideology
is starting to get predictable?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.256
Kinda conventional?

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.416
Do you ever feel like you're always
listening to people who agree with you?

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.176
Why is that dangerous?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.776
Because when we talk
in this country about economics,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.456
on the right, conservatives,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.120
you're always talking about taxes
and regulations and big government.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.616
And on the left, liberals,
you're talking about economics,

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.896
it's always about income inequality.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.336
Right? Now those are important things,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.616
really important to me,
really important to you.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.176
But when it comes to lifting people up

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.656
who are starving and need us today,
those are distractions.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.096
We need to come together
around the best ways

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.456
to mitigate poverty
using the best tools at our disposal,

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.976
and that comes only when conservatives
recognize that they need liberals

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.616
and their obsession with poverty,

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:42.760
and liberals need conservatives
and their obsession with free markets.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.736
That's the diversity in which lies
the future strength of this country,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.720
if we choose to take it.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.816
So how are we going to do it?
How are we going to do it together?

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.000
I've got to have some action items,
not just for you but for me.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.296
Number one. Action item number one:

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.536
remember, it's not good enough
just to tolerate people who disagree.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.256
It's not good enough.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.176
We have to remember that we need
people who disagree with us,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.536
because there are people
who need all of us

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.000
who are still waiting for these tools.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.976
Now, what are you going to do?
How are you going to express that?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.936
Where does this start? It starts here.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.216
You know, all of us
in this room, we're blessed.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.296
We're blessed with people
who listen to us.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.216
We're blessed with prosperity.
We're blessed with leadership.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.640
When people hear us,
with the kind of unpredictable ideology,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.616
then maybe people will listen.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.816
Maybe progress will start at that point.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.600
That's number one. Number two.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.960
Number two: I'm asking you
and I'm asking me

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.056
to be the person specifically
who blurs the lines,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.360
who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.416
If you're a conservative,

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.976
be the conservative
who is always going on about poverty

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.816
and the moral obligation
to be a warrior for the poor.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.536
And if you're a liberal,
be a liberal who is always talking

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.136
about the beauty of free markets
to solve our problems

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.760
when we use them responsibly.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.056
If we do that, we get two things.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.656
Number one: we get to start
to work on the next two billion

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.216
and be the solution
that we've seen so much of in the past

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.136
and we need to see more of in the future.
That's what we get.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.136
And the second is
that we might just be able

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.816
to take the ghastly holy war of ideology
that we're suffering under in this country

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.096
and turn it into a competition of ideas

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.096
based on solidarity and mutual respect.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.976
And then maybe, just maybe,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.680
we'll all realize that our big differences

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.480
aren't really that big after all.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.616
Thank you.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:01.468
(Applause)
