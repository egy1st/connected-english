00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.936
Hannah is excited to be going to college.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.736
She couldn't wait
to get out of her parents' house,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.776
to prove to them that she's an adult,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.480
and to prove to her new friends
that she belongs.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.936
She heads to a campus party

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.496
where she sees a guy
that she has a crush on.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.880
Let's call him Mike.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.520
The next day, Hannah wakes up
with a pounding headache.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.960
She can only remember
the night in flashes.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.176
But what she does remember is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.040
throwing up in the hall
outside Mike's room

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.536
and staring at the wall silently
while he was inside her,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.840
wanting it to stop,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.480
then shakily stumbling home.

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:44.856
She doesn't feel good about what happened,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.600
but she thinks, "Maybe this is just
what sex in college is?"

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.056
One in five women and one in 13 men
will be sexually assaulted

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.200
at some point during their college career
in the United States.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.936
Less than 10 percent will ever report
their assault to their school

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.456
or to the police.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.400
And those who do, on average,
wait 11 months to make the report.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.736
Hannah initially just feels like dealing
with what happened on her own.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.336
But when she sees Mike
taking girls home from parties,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.600
she's worried about them.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.856
After graduation, Hannah learns

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.920
that she was one of five women
who Mike did the exact same thing to.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.256
And this is not an unlikely scenario

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.336
because 90 percent of sexual assaults

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.600
are committed by repeat offenders.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.816
But with such low reporting rates,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.656
it's fairly unlikely that even
repeat perpetrators will be reported,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.216
much less anything happen if they are.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.376
In fact, only six percent
of assaults reported to the police

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.280
end with the assailant
spending a single day in prison.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.480
Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance
that they'll get away with it.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.816
This means there's practically
no deterrent to assault

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.320
in the United States.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.496
Now, I'm an infectious disease
epidemiologist by training.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.616
I'm interested in systems and networks

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.640
and where we can concentrate
our resources to do the most good.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.320
So this, to me, is a tragic
but a solvable problem.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.416
So when the issue of campus assault
started hitting the news a few years ago,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.816
it felt like a unique opportunity
to make a change.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.040
And so we did.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.336
We started by talking
to college survivors.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.360
And what they wish they'd had
in college is pretty simple;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.416
they wanted a website,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.576
one they could use
at the time and place

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.040
that felt safest to them

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.776
with clearly written information
about their reporting options,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.936
with the ability to electronically
report their assault,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.576
rather than having the first step

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.480
to go in and talk to someone
who may or may not believe them.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.376
With the option to create
a secure, timestamped document

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.896
of what happened to them,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.960
preserving evidence
even if they don't want to report yet.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.536
And lastly, and perhaps most critically,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.576
with the ability to report their assault

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.240
only if someone else
reported the same assailant.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.056
You see, knowing that you weren't
the only one changes everything.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.416
It changes the way
you frame your own experience,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.896
it changes the way
you think about your perpetrator,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.736
it means that if you do come forward,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.800
you'll have someone else's back
and they'll have yours.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.336
We created a website
that actually does this

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.376
and we launched it [...] in August,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.000
on two college campuses.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.496
And we included a unique matching system

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.456
where if Mike's first victim
had come forward,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.256
saved her record,
entered into the matching system

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.536
and named Mike,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.936
and Mike's second victim
had done the same thing

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.616
a few months later,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.976
they would have matched

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.496
and the verified contact information
of both survivors

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.256
would have been sent
to the authorities at the same time

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.320
for investigation and follow up.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.296
If a system like this had existed
for Hannah and her peers,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.856
it's more likely
that they would have reported,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.656
that they would have been believed,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.936
and that Mike would have been
kicked off campus,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.960
gone to jail, or at least
gotten the help that he needed.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.416
And if we were able to stop
repeat offenders like Mike

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.056
after just their second assault
following a match,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.696
survivors like Hannah
would never even be assaulted

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.000
in the first place.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.856
We could prevent
59 percent of sexual assaults

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.960
just by stopping
repeat perpetrators earlier on.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.776
And because we're creating
a real deterrent to assault,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.936
for perhaps the first time,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.320
maybe the Mikes of the world
would never even try to assault anyone.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.616
The type of system I'm describing,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.016
the type of system that survivors want

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.576
is a type of information escrow,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.816
meaning an entity that holds on
to information for you

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.296
and only releases it to a third party

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.896
when certain pre-agreed upon
conditions are met,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.120
such as a match.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.336
The application that we built
is for college campuses.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.416
But the same type of system
could be used in the military

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.840
or even the workplace.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.256
We don't have to live in a world

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.440
where 99 percent of rapists
get away with it.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.536
We can create one

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.496
where those who do wrong
are held accountable,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.936
where survivors get the support
and justice they deserve,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.856
where the authorities
get the information they need,

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.776
and where there's a real deterrent

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.440
to violating the rights
of another human being.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.336
Thank you.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.320
(Applause)
