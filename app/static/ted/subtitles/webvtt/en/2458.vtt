00:00:00.645 --> 00:00:02.015
So in college,

00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:04.913
I was a government major,

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:07.399
which means I had to write
a lot of papers.

00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:09.471
Now, when a normal student writes a paper,

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:11.868
they might spread the work out
a little like this.

00:00:11.892 --> 00:00:13.043
So, you know --

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:14.724
(Laughter)

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.575
you get started maybe a little slowly,

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.567
but you get enough done in the first week

00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:20.422
that, with some heavier days later on,

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:22.603
everything gets done, things stay civil.

00:00:22.627 --> 00:00:23.829
(Laughter)

00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:26.124
And I would want to do that like that.

00:00:26.148 --> 00:00:27.342
That would be the plan.

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.856
I would have it all ready to go,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.374
but then, actually, the paper
would come along,

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.339
and then I would kind of do this.

00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:36.733
(Laughter)

00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:38.900
And that would happen every single paper.

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:43.520
But then came my 90-page senior thesis,

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.831
a paper you're supposed
to spend a year on.

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:49.474
And I knew for a paper like that,
my normal work flow was not an option.

00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:50.899
It was way too big a project.

00:00:50.923 --> 00:00:52.076
So I planned things out,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.305
and I decided I kind of had
to go something like this.

00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:57.233
This is how the year would go.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.224
So I'd start off light,

00:00:59.248 --> 00:01:01.566
and I'd bump it up in the middle months,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.216
and then at the end,
I would kick it up into high gear

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.679
just like a little staircase.

00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:07.765
How hard could it be
to walk up the stairs?

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:09.552
No big deal, right?

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.900
But then, the funniest thing happened.

00:01:12.924 --> 00:01:14.235
Those first few months?

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:15.958
They came and went,

00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:17.567
and I couldn't quite do stuff.

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:19.440
So we had an awesome new revised plan.

00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:20.631
(Laughter)

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:21.814
And then --

00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:23.720
(Laughter)

00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:26.528
But then those middle months
actually went by,

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:28.734
and I didn't really write words,

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:30.593
and so we were here.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.076
And then two months turned into one month,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.725
which turned into two weeks.

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:37.058
And one day I woke up

00:01:37.724 --> 00:01:40.343
with three days until the deadline,

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:43.433
still not having written a word,

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:45.516
and so I did the only thing I could:

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.147
I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:50.447
pulling not one but two all-nighters --

00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.040
humans are not supposed to pull
two all-nighters --

00:01:54.373 --> 00:01:56.366
sprinted across campus,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.876
dove in slow motion,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.956
and got it in just at the deadline.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.004
I thought that was the end of everything.

00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:03.587
But a week later I get a call,

00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:05.097
and it's the school.

00:02:05.757 --> 00:02:07.396
And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?"

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.888
And I say, "Yeah."

00:02:08.912 --> 00:02:11.252
And they say, "We need
to talk about your thesis."

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:12.531
And I say, "OK."

00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:14.690
And they say,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.126
"It's the best one we've ever seen."

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.855
(Laughter)

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:22.704
(Applause)

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.247
That did not happen.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.409
(Laughter)

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:31.056
It was a very, very bad thesis.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.354
(Laughter)

00:02:33.378 --> 00:02:37.478
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment
when all of you thought,

00:02:37.502 --> 00:02:39.407
"This guy is amazing!"

00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:40.779
(Laughter)

00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:42.470
No, no, it was very, very bad.

00:02:43.343 --> 00:02:46.751
Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.

00:02:46.775 --> 00:02:48.518
I write the blog Wait But Why.

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:52.278
And a couple of years ago,
I decided to write about procrastination.

00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:55.586
My behavior has always perplexed
the non-procrastinators around me,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.298
and I wanted to explain
to the non-procrastinators of the world

00:02:59.322 --> 00:03:01.429
what goes on in the heads
of procrastinators,

00:03:01.453 --> 00:03:02.893
and why we are the way we are.

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:04.073
Now, I had a hypothesis

00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:06.952
that the brains of procrastinators
were actually different

00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:08.933
than the brains of other people.

00:03:09.698 --> 00:03:11.889
And to test this, I found an MRI lab

00:03:11.913 --> 00:03:14.345
that actually let me scan both my brain

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.024
and the brain of a proven
non-procrastinator,

00:03:17.048 --> 00:03:18.483
so I could compare them.

00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:20.708
I actually brought them here
to show you today.

00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:24.269
I want you to take a look carefully
to see if you can notice a difference.

00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:26.607
I know that if you're not
a trained brain expert,

00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:28.894
it's not that obvious,
but just take a look, OK?

00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:31.046
So here's the brain
of a non-procrastinator.

00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:34.109
(Laughter)

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:35.284
Now ...

00:03:36.325 --> 00:03:37.639
here's my brain.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.006
(Laughter)

00:03:43.713 --> 00:03:45.277
There is a difference.

00:03:45.904 --> 00:03:48.292
Both brains have a Rational
Decision-Maker in them,

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:49.968
but the procrastinator's brain

00:03:49.992 --> 00:03:52.978
also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:55.304
Now, what does this mean
for the procrastinator?

00:03:55.328 --> 00:03:57.769
Well, it means everything's fine
until this happens.

00:03:57.793 --> 00:04:00.415
[This is a perfect time
to get some work done.] [Nope!]

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.372
So the Rational Decision-Maker
will make the rational decision

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:05.292
to do something productive,

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:07.266
but the Monkey doesn't like that plan,

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.798
so he actually takes the wheel,

00:04:08.822 --> 00:04:11.703
and he says, "Actually, let's read
the entire Wikipedia page

00:04:11.727 --> 00:04:13.863
of the Nancy Kerrigan/
Tonya Harding scandal,

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:16.018
because I just remembered
that that happened.

00:04:16.042 --> 00:04:17.058
(Laughter)

00:04:17.082 --> 00:04:18.240
Then --

00:04:18.264 --> 00:04:19.527
(Laughter)

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.589
Then we're going to go over to the fridge,

00:04:21.613 --> 00:04:24.479
to see if there's anything new
in there since 10 minutes ago.

00:04:24.503 --> 00:04:27.141
After that, we're going to go
on a YouTube spiral

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:30.415
that starts with videos
of Richard Feynman talking about magnets

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.155
and ends much, much later
with us watching interviews

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:35.059
with Justin Bieber's mom.

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:37.271
(Laughter)

00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:39.058
"All of that's going to take a while,

00:04:39.082 --> 00:04:42.584
so we're not going to really have room
on the schedule for any work today.

00:04:42.608 --> 00:04:43.771
Sorry!"

00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:44.960
(Sigh)

00:04:46.325 --> 00:04:49.694
Now, what is going on here?

00:04:51.481 --> 00:04:54.172
The Instant Gratification Monkey
does not seem like a guy

00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:55.450
you want behind the wheel.

00:04:55.474 --> 00:04:57.419
He lives entirely in the present moment.

00:04:57.443 --> 00:05:00.271
He has no memory of the past,
no knowledge of the future,

00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:01.992
and he only cares about two things:

00:05:02.016 --> 00:05:03.699
easy and fun.

00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:07.430
Now, in the animal world, that works fine.

00:05:07.454 --> 00:05:08.662
If you're a dog

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:12.257
and you spend your whole life doing
nothing other than easy and fun things,

00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.446
you're a huge success!

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.381
(Laughter)

00:05:15.405 --> 00:05:16.691
And to the Monkey,

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.063
humans are just another animal species.

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:24.593
You have to keep well-slept, well-fed
and propagating into the next generation,

00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:26.903
which in tribal times
might have worked OK.

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:29.777
But, if you haven't noticed,
now we're not in tribal times.

00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:33.934
We're in an advanced civilization,
and the Monkey does not know what that is.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.239
Which is why we have
another guy in our brain,

00:05:36.263 --> 00:05:38.628
the Rational Decision-Maker,

00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:41.679
who gives us the ability to do things
no other animal can do.

00:05:41.703 --> 00:05:43.624
We can visualize the future.

00:05:43.648 --> 00:05:45.400
We can see the big picture.

00:05:45.424 --> 00:05:46.774
We can make long-term plans.

00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:49.281
And he wants to take
all of that into account.

00:05:50.138 --> 00:05:51.829
And he wants to just have us do

00:05:51.853 --> 00:05:54.801
whatever makes sense
to be doing right now.

00:05:54.825 --> 00:05:56.214
Now, sometimes it makes sense

00:05:56.238 --> 00:05:58.267
to be doing things that are easy and fun,

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.442
like when you're having dinner
or going to bed

00:06:00.466 --> 00:06:02.294
or enjoying well-earned leisure time.

00:06:02.318 --> 00:06:03.768
That's why there's an overlap.

00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:05.536
Sometimes they agree.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.382
But other times, it makes much more sense

00:06:08.406 --> 00:06:12.008
to be doing things that are harder
and less pleasant,

00:06:12.032 --> 00:06:13.572
for the sake of the big picture.

00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:15.485
And that's when we have a conflict.

00:06:16.017 --> 00:06:17.332
And for the procrastinator,

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:19.865
that conflict tends to end
a certain way every time,

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.609
leaving him spending a lot of time
in this orange zone,

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:27.960
an easy and fun place that's entirely
out of the Makes Sense circle.

00:06:27.984 --> 00:06:30.263
I call it the Dark Playground.

00:06:30.287 --> 00:06:31.911
(Laughter)

00:06:31.935 --> 00:06:35.063
Now, the Dark Playground is a place

00:06:35.087 --> 00:06:38.279
that all of you procrastinators
out there know very well.

00:06:38.892 --> 00:06:40.696
It's where leisure activities happen

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.030
at times when leisure activities
are not supposed to be happening.

00:06:44.418 --> 00:06:46.308
The fun you have in the Dark Playground

00:06:46.332 --> 00:06:48.815
isn't actually fun,
because it's completely unearned,

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:52.054
and the air is filled with guilt,
dread, anxiety, self-hatred --

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.196
all of those good procrastinator feelings.

00:06:54.703 --> 00:06:58.179
And the question is, in this situation,
with the Monkey behind the wheel,

00:06:58.203 --> 00:07:01.796
how does the procrastinator ever get
himself over here to this blue zone,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.101
a less pleasant place, but where
really important things happen?

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:10.162
Well, turns out the procrastinator
has a guardian angel,

00:07:10.186 --> 00:07:13.394
someone who's always looking
down on him and watching over him

00:07:13.418 --> 00:07:14.848
in his darkest moments --

00:07:14.872 --> 00:07:16.967
someone called the Panic Monster.

00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:20.069
(Laughter)

00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:27.246
Now, the Panic Monster
is dormant most of the time,

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.172
but he suddenly wakes up
anytime a deadline gets too close

00:07:31.196 --> 00:07:33.241
or there's danger of public embarrassment,

00:07:33.265 --> 00:07:35.776
a career disaster or some other
scary consequence.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.972
And importantly, he's the only thing
the Monkey is terrified of.

00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:44.574
Now, he became very relevant
in my life pretty recently,

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:47.844
because the people of TED
reached out to me about six months ago

00:07:47.868 --> 00:07:49.889
and invited me to do a TED Talk.

00:07:49.913 --> 00:07:52.341
(Laughter)

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.965
Now, of course, I said yes.

00:07:56.989 --> 00:08:00.794
It's always been a dream of mine
to have done a TED Talk in the past.

00:08:00.818 --> 00:08:04.790
(Laughter)

00:08:04.814 --> 00:08:08.511
(Applause)

00:08:12.203 --> 00:08:14.172
But in the middle of all this excitement,

00:08:14.196 --> 00:08:17.497
the Rational Decision-Maker seemed
to have something else on his mind.

00:08:17.521 --> 00:08:20.069
He was saying, "Are we clear
on what we just accepted?

00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:23.342
Do we get what's going to be now
happening one day in the future?

00:08:23.366 --> 00:08:25.633
We need to sit down
and work on this right now."

00:08:25.657 --> 00:08:28.922
And the Monkey said, "Totally agree,
but let's just open Google Earth

00:08:28.946 --> 00:08:32.106
and zoom in to the bottom of India,
like 200 feet above the ground,

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.751
and scroll up for two and a half hours
til we get to the top of the country,

00:08:35.775 --> 00:08:37.753
so we can get a better feel for India."

00:08:37.777 --> 00:08:42.212
(Laughter)

00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:44.634
So that's what we did that day.

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:47.328
(Laughter)

00:08:48.604 --> 00:08:52.500
As six months turned into four
and then two and then one,

00:08:52.524 --> 00:08:55.619
the people of TED decided
to release the speakers.

00:08:55.643 --> 00:08:58.255
And I opened up the website,
and there was my face

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.635
staring right back at me.

00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:01.259
And guess who woke up?

00:09:01.283 --> 00:09:04.398
(Laughter)

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.880
So the Panic Monster
starts losing his mind,

00:09:07.904 --> 00:09:10.650
and a few seconds later,
the whole system's in mayhem.

00:09:10.674 --> 00:09:13.120
(Laughter)

00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.612
And the Monkey -- remember,
he's terrified of the Panic Monster --

00:09:18.636 --> 00:09:19.794
boom, he's up the tree!

00:09:19.818 --> 00:09:20.969
And finally,

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:23.589
finally, the Rational Decision-Maker
can take the wheel

00:09:23.613 --> 00:09:25.331
and I can start working on the talk.

00:09:25.355 --> 00:09:27.643
Now, the Panic Monster explains

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:31.148
all kinds of pretty insane
procrastinator behavior,

00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:33.506
like how someone like me
could spend two weeks

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.374
unable to start the opening
sentence of a paper,

00:09:37.398 --> 00:09:40.169
and then miraculously find
the unbelievable work ethic

00:09:40.193 --> 00:09:43.289
to stay up all night
and write eight pages.

00:09:44.385 --> 00:09:47.367
And this entire situation,
with the three characters --

00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:49.411
this is the procrastinator's system.

00:09:50.096 --> 00:09:53.521
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.

00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:57.607
This is what I decided to write about
on the blog a couple of years ago.

00:09:57.631 --> 00:10:00.602
When I did, I was amazed by the response.

00:10:00.626 --> 00:10:02.779
Literally thousands of emails came in,

00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:05.580
from all different kinds of people
from all over the world,

00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:07.342
doing all different kinds of things.

00:10:07.366 --> 00:10:10.332
These are people who were nurses,
bankers, painters, engineers

00:10:10.356 --> 00:10:12.678
and lots and lots of PhD students.

00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:14.703
(Laughter)

00:10:14.727 --> 00:10:17.015
And they were all writing,
saying the same thing:

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:18.991
"I have this problem too."

00:10:19.015 --> 00:10:22.844
But what struck me was the contrast
between the light tone of the post

00:10:22.868 --> 00:10:24.963
and the heaviness of these emails.

00:10:24.987 --> 00:10:28.070
These people were writing
with intense frustration

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:30.856
about what procrastination
had done to their lives,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.910
about what this Monkey had done to them.

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:37.868
And I thought about this, and I said,

00:10:37.892 --> 00:10:41.004
well, if the procrastinator's system
works, then what's going on?

00:10:41.028 --> 00:10:43.514
Why are all of these people
in such a dark place?

00:10:43.538 --> 00:10:46.836
Well, it turns out that there's
two kinds of procrastination.

00:10:47.987 --> 00:10:50.821
Everything I've talked about today,
the examples I've given,

00:10:50.845 --> 00:10:51.996
they all have deadlines.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.318
And when there's deadlines,

00:10:53.342 --> 00:10:56.267
the effects of procrastination
are contained to the short term

00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:58.204
because the Panic Monster gets involved.

00:10:58.228 --> 00:11:00.282
But there's a second kind
of procrastination

00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:02.793
that happens in situations
when there is no deadline.

00:11:02.817 --> 00:11:05.507
So if you wanted a career
where you're a self-starter --

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:07.944
something in the arts,
something entrepreneurial --

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:11.493
there's no deadlines on those things
at first, because nothing's happening,

00:11:11.517 --> 00:11:13.761
not until you've gone out
and done the hard work

00:11:13.785 --> 00:11:15.411
to get momentum, get things going.

00:11:15.435 --> 00:11:18.513
There's also all kinds of important things
outside of your career

00:11:18.537 --> 00:11:20.142
that don't involve any deadlines,

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:23.431
like seeing your family or exercising
and taking care of your health,

00:11:23.455 --> 00:11:24.859
working on your relationship

00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:27.564
or getting out of a relationship
that isn't working.

00:11:27.588 --> 00:11:32.736
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism
of doing these hard things

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.645
is the Panic Monster, that's a problem,

00:11:34.669 --> 00:11:37.469
because in all of these
non-deadline situations,

00:11:37.493 --> 00:11:39.121
the Panic Monster doesn't show up.

00:11:39.145 --> 00:11:40.597
He has nothing to wake up for,

00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:43.319
so the effects of procrastination,
they're not contained;

00:11:43.343 --> 00:11:45.083
they just extend outward forever.

00:11:45.953 --> 00:11:48.693
And it's this long-term
kind of procrastination

00:11:48.717 --> 00:11:51.798
that's much less visible
and much less talked about

00:11:51.822 --> 00:11:54.723
than the funnier, short-term
deadline-based kind.

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:57.850
It's usually suffered
quietly and privately.

00:11:58.816 --> 00:11:59.970
And it can be the source

00:11:59.994 --> 00:12:03.729
of a huge amount of long-term
unhappiness, and regrets.

00:12:04.576 --> 00:12:07.448
And I thought, that's why
those people are emailing,

00:12:07.472 --> 00:12:09.974
and that's why they're
in such a bad place.

00:12:09.998 --> 00:12:12.742
It's not that they're cramming
for some project.

00:12:12.766 --> 00:12:16.187
It's that long-term procrastination
has made them feel like a spectator,

00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:18.250
at times, in their own lives.

00:12:18.594 --> 00:12:21.576
The frustration is not
that they couldn't achieve their dreams;

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.689
it's that they weren't even
able to start chasing them.

00:12:24.713 --> 00:12:28.896
So I read these emails
and I had a little bit of an epiphany --

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:33.582
that I don't think
non-procrastinators exist.

00:12:33.979 --> 00:12:37.215
That's right -- I think all of you
are procrastinators.

00:12:37.898 --> 00:12:39.812
Now, you might not all be a mess,

00:12:39.836 --> 00:12:41.186
like some of us,

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.739
(Laughter)

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:46.079
and some of you may have
a healthy relationship with deadlines,

00:12:46.103 --> 00:12:48.627
but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick

00:12:48.651 --> 00:12:50.491
is when the deadlines aren't there.

00:12:51.249 --> 00:12:53.281
Now, I want to show you one last thing.

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:55.678
I call this a Life Calendar.

00:12:56.352 --> 00:13:00.631
That's one box for every week
of a 90-year life.

00:13:01.345 --> 00:13:02.934
That's not that many boxes,

00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.932
especially since we've already
used a bunch of those.

00:13:06.607 --> 00:13:11.739
So I think we need to all take a long,
hard look at that calendar.

00:13:12.977 --> 00:13:15.990
We need to think about what
we're really procrastinating on,

00:13:16.014 --> 00:13:19.379
because everyone is procrastinating
on something in life.

00:13:20.782 --> 00:13:23.812
We need to stay aware
of the Instant Gratification Monkey.

00:13:25.455 --> 00:13:27.947
That's a job for all of us.

00:13:28.669 --> 00:13:30.969
And because there's not
that many boxes on there,

00:13:30.993 --> 00:13:33.283
it's a job that should
probably start today.

00:13:33.307 --> 00:13:36.307
Well, maybe not today, but ...

00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:37.972
(Laughter)

00:13:37.996 --> 00:13:39.146
You know.

00:13:39.576 --> 00:13:40.726
Sometime soon.

00:13:41.393 --> 00:13:42.602
Thank you.

00:13:42.626 --> 00:13:50.624
(Applause)
