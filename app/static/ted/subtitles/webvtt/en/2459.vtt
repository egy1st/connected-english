WEBVTT

00:00:01.072 --> 00:00:04.786
Today's computers are so amazing

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.931
that we fail to notice
how terrible they really are.

00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:12.570
I'd like to talk to you today
about this problem,

00:00:12.594 --> 00:00:15.265
and how we can fix it with neuroscience.

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:20.073
First, I'd like to take you back
to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:21.884
that had a profound impact on me.

00:00:22.437 --> 00:00:25.611
I was sitting in a dive bar
outside of Columbia University,

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.543
where I studied computer science
and neuroscience,

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:31.635
and I was having this great conversation
with a fellow student

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.962
about the power of holograms
to one day replace computers.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.479
And just as we were getting
to the best part of the conversation,

00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:40.065
of course, his phone lights up.

00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:45.046
And he pulls it towards himself,
and he looks down and he starts typing.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.253
And then he forces his eyeballs
back up to mine and he goes,

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:50.380
"Keep going. I'm with you."

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:52.761
But of course his eyes were glazed over,

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:54.128
and the moment was dead.

00:00:54.964 --> 00:00:56.184
Meanwhile across the bar,

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:58.492
I noticed another student
holding his phone,

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.961
this time towards a group.

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:02.745
He was swiping through
pictures on Instagram,

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.303
and these kids were laughing hysterically.

00:01:05.327 --> 00:01:08.846
And that dichotomy
between how crappy I was feeling

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.648
and how happy they were feeling
about the same technology,

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:13.050
really got me thinking.

00:01:13.074 --> 00:01:15.407
And the more I thought of it,
the more I realized

00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:19.203
it was clearly not the digital information
that was the bad guy here,

00:01:19.227 --> 00:01:22.934
it was simply the display position
that was separating me from my friend

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.179
and that was binding those kids together.

00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:27.807
See, they were connected around something,

00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:31.229
just like our ancestors
who evolved their social cognitions

00:01:31.253 --> 00:01:33.298
telling stories around the campfire.

00:01:33.857 --> 00:01:36.201
And that's exactly what tools
should do, I think.

00:01:36.225 --> 00:01:37.704
They should extend our bodies.

00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:40.397
And I think computers today
are doing quite the opposite.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.167
Whether you're sending
an email to your wife

00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:45.213
or you're composing a symphony

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:46.841
or just consoling a friend,

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:49.211
you're doing it in pretty
much the same way.

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:51.468
You're hunched over these rectangles,

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:54.243
fumbling with buttons and menus
and more rectangles.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.756
And I think this is the wrong way,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.208
I think we can start using
a much more natural machine.

00:02:00.232 --> 00:02:03.750
We should use machines that bring
our work back into the world.

00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:06.793
We should use machines that use
the principles of neuroscience

00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:10.816
to extend our senses
versus going against them.

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:14.092
Now it just so happens
that I have such a machine here.

00:02:14.116 --> 00:02:15.273
It's called the Meta 2.

00:02:15.297 --> 00:02:16.487
Let's try it out.

00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:28.430
Now in front of me right now,
I can see the audience,

00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:30.488
and I can see my very hands.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:33.203
And in three, two, one,

00:02:33.227 --> 00:02:35.979
we're going to see an immersive
hologram appear,

00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:38.283
a very realistic hologram
appear in front of me,

00:02:38.307 --> 00:02:40.871
of our very glasses I'm wearing
on my head right now.

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:43.736
And of course this could be
anything that we're shopping for

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.911
or learning from,

00:02:44.935 --> 00:02:46.278
and I can use my hands

00:02:46.302 --> 00:02:50.410
to very nicely kind of move
it around with fine control.

00:02:50.434 --> 00:02:53.629
And I think Iron Man would be proud.

00:02:54.643 --> 00:02:57.021
We're going to come back
to this in just a bit.

00:02:57.783 --> 00:02:59.947
(Applause)

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:02.882
Now if you're anything like me,
your mind is already reeling

00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:06.207
with the possibilities of what we can do
with this kind of technology,

00:03:06.231 --> 00:03:07.389
so let's look at a few.

00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:08.563
My mom is an architect,

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:10.492
so naturally the first thing I imagined

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:12.997
was laying out a building in 3D space

00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:15.413
instead of having to use
these 2D floor plans.

00:03:15.437 --> 00:03:17.902
She's actually touching graphics right now

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:19.703
and selecting an interior decor.

00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:23.091
This was all shot through a GoPro
through our very glasses.

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:25.730
And this next use case
is very personal to me,

00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:29.168
it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's
glass brain project,

00:03:29.192 --> 00:03:31.083
courtesy of UCSF.

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:32.802
As a neuroscience student,

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:34.223
I would always fantasize

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:39.686
about the ability to learn and memorize
these complex brain structures

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.877
with an actual machine,

00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.203
where I could touch and play
with the various brain structures.

00:03:44.535 --> 00:03:48.061
Now what you're seeing
is called augmented reality,

00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:51.036
but to me, it's part
of a much more important story --

00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:58.203
a story of how we can begin
to extend our bodies with digital devices,

00:03:58.227 --> 00:04:00.711
instead of the other way around.

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:03.203
Now ...

00:04:03.227 --> 00:04:06.589
in the next few years, humanity's
going to go through a shift, I think.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:09.826
We're going to start putting
an entire layer of digital information

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.285
on the real world.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.318
Just imagine for a moment

00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:15.602
what this could mean for storytellers,

00:04:15.626 --> 00:04:16.941
for painters,

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.123
for brain surgeons,

00:04:19.147 --> 00:04:20.964
for interior decorators

00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:23.099
and maybe for all of us here today.

00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:25.711
And what I think we need
to do as a community,

00:04:25.735 --> 00:04:27.727
is really try and make an effort

00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:30.642
to imagine how we can
create this new reality

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:33.364
in a way that extends
the human experience,

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:35.356
instead of gamifying our reality

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.443
or cluttering it with digital information.

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:39.589
And that's what I'm very passionate about.

00:04:40.318 --> 00:04:42.479
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.

00:04:42.503 --> 00:04:43.670
In about five years --

00:04:43.694 --> 00:04:45.320
this is not the smallest device --

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:46.512
in about five years,

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.464
these are all going to look like
strips of glass on our eyes

00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:50.807
that project holograms.

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:54.736
And just like we don't care so much
about which phone we buy

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.181
in terms of the hardware -- we buy it
for the operating system --

00:04:58.205 --> 00:04:59.364
as a neuroscientist,

00:04:59.388 --> 00:05:03.431
I always dreamt of building
the iOS of the mind, if you will.

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:07.417
And it's very, very important
that we get this right,

00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:09.735
because we might be living
inside of these things

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.447
for at least as long as we've lived

00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:14.112
with the Windows graphical user interface.

00:05:14.136 --> 00:05:15.453
And I don't know about you,

00:05:15.477 --> 00:05:17.985
but living inside of Windows scares me.

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.329
(Laughter)

00:05:19.353 --> 00:05:23.243
To isolate the single most intuitive
interface out of infinity,

00:05:23.267 --> 00:05:25.947
we use neuroscience to drive
our design guidelines,

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:29.561
instead of letting a bunch of designers
fight it out in the boardroom.

00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:32.234
And the principle we all revolve around

00:05:32.258 --> 00:05:35.266
is what's called the "Neural Path
of Least Resistance."

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.421
At every turn, we're connecting
the iOS of the brain with our brain

00:05:39.445 --> 00:05:41.831
on, for the first time, our brain's terms.

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:46.247
In other words, we're trying to create
a zero learning-curve computer.

00:05:46.738 --> 00:05:50.073
We're building a system
that you've always known how to use.

00:05:50.097 --> 00:05:52.990
Here are the first three
design guidelines that we employ

00:05:53.014 --> 00:05:55.345
in this brand-new form of user experience.

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:58.763
First and foremost,
you are the operating system.

00:05:58.787 --> 00:06:01.494
Traditional file systems
are complex and abstract,

00:06:01.518 --> 00:06:04.109
and they take your brain
extra steps to decode them.

00:06:04.133 --> 00:06:06.938
We're going against the Neural Path
of Least Resistance.

00:06:06.962 --> 00:06:09.160
Meanwhile, in augmented reality,

00:06:09.184 --> 00:06:14.159
you can of course place
your holographic TED panel over here,

00:06:14.183 --> 00:06:17.734
and your holographic email
on the other side of the desk,

00:06:17.758 --> 00:06:23.581
and your spatial memory evolved just fine
to go ahead and retrieve them.

00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:26.633
You could put your holographic Tesla
that you're shopping for --

00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:30.162
or whatever model my legal team
told me to put in right before the show.

00:06:30.186 --> 00:06:31.188
(Laughter)

00:06:31.212 --> 00:06:33.944
Perfect. And your brain knows
exactly how to get it back.

00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:37.216
The second interface guideline
we call "touch to see."

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.300
What do babies do when they see
something that grabs their interest?

00:06:42.712 --> 00:06:44.428
They try and reach out and touch it.

00:06:44.452 --> 00:06:47.519
And that's exactly how the natural
machine should work as well.

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:50.927
Turns out the visual system
gets a fundamental boost

00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:53.360
from a sense we call proprioception --

00:06:53.384 --> 00:06:55.629
that's the sense
of our body parts in space.

00:06:55.653 --> 00:06:59.463
So by touching our work directly,
we're not only going to control it better,

00:06:59.487 --> 00:07:02.065
we're also going to understand
it much more deeply.

00:07:02.637 --> 00:07:04.299
Hence, touch to see.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:06.718
But it's not enough
to experience things ourselves.

00:07:06.742 --> 00:07:08.969
We're inherently these social primates.

00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:11.105
And this leads me to our third guideline,

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:13.926
the holographic campfire
from our first story.

00:07:14.537 --> 00:07:16.451
Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests

00:07:16.475 --> 00:07:20.023
that we can connect with each other
and with our work much better

00:07:20.047 --> 00:07:23.032
if we can see each other's
faces and hands in 3D.

00:07:23.056 --> 00:07:24.893
So if you look at the video behind me,

00:07:24.917 --> 00:07:29.226
you can see two Meta users
playing around with the same hologram,

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.965
making eye contact,
connected around this thing,

00:07:31.989 --> 00:07:34.680
instead of being distracted
by external devices.

00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:40.624
Let's go ahead and try this again
with neuroscience in mind.

00:07:44.127 --> 00:07:47.471
So again, our favorite interface,
the iOS of the mind.

00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:50.226
I'm going to now take a step further

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.000
and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses

00:07:53.024 --> 00:07:54.744
and leave it right here by the desk.

00:07:54.768 --> 00:07:56.490
I'm now with you, I'm in the moment,

00:07:56.514 --> 00:07:57.666
we're connecting.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.608
My spatial memory kicks in,
and I can go ahead and grab it

00:08:00.632 --> 00:08:02.733
and bring it right back here, reminding me

00:08:02.757 --> 00:08:04.643
that I am the operating system.

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:07.047
And now my proprioception is working,

00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:10.867
and I can go ahead and explode
these glasses into a thousand parts

00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:15.281
and touch the very sensor
that is currently scanning my hand.

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:17.266
But it's not enough to see things alone,

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.262
so in a second, my co-founder Ray
is going to make a 3D call --

00:08:20.286 --> 00:08:21.444
Ray?

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:22.954
(Ringing)

00:08:23.387 --> 00:08:24.883
Hey Ray, how's it going?

00:08:24.907 --> 00:08:28.335
Guys, I can see this guy
in front me in full 3D.

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:30.656
And he is photo-realistic.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.976
(Applause)

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.152
Thank you.

00:08:33.176 --> 00:08:37.157
My mirror-neuron subsystem suggests
that this is going to replace phones

00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:38.577
in not too long.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.419
Ray, how's it going?

00:08:40.443 --> 00:08:42.808
Ray: Great. We're live today.

00:08:42.832 --> 00:08:44.381
(Applause)

00:08:44.405 --> 00:08:46.517
MG: Ray, give the crowd a gift

00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:49.176
of the holographic brain
we saw from the video earlier.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.358
Guys, this is not only
going to change phones,

00:08:51.382 --> 00:08:54.192
it's also going to change
the way we collaborate.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.963
Thank you so much.

00:08:55.987 --> 00:08:57.145
Thanks, Ray.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:58.320
Ray: You're welcome.

00:08:58.344 --> 00:08:59.351
(Applause)

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:04.323
MG: So folks, this is the message
that I discovered in that bar in 2011:

00:09:04.347 --> 00:09:08.488
The future of computers is not
locked inside one of these screens.

00:09:08.944 --> 00:09:11.711
It's right here, inside of us.

00:09:13.876 --> 00:09:17.455
(Applause)

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:20.836
So if there's one idea that I could
leave you with here today,

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.916
it's that the natural machine
is not some figment of the future,

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.973
it's right here in 2016.

00:09:26.447 --> 00:09:29.222
Which is why all hundred of us at Meta,

00:09:29.246 --> 00:09:30.921
including the administrative staff,

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.387
the executives,

00:09:32.411 --> 00:09:34.134
the designers, the engineers --

00:09:34.158 --> 00:09:36.060
before TED2017,

00:09:36.084 --> 00:09:39.741
we're all going to be throwing
away our external monitors

00:09:39.765 --> 00:09:44.885
and replacing them with a truly
and profoundly more natural machine.

00:09:44.909 --> 00:09:46.100
Thank you very much.

00:09:46.124 --> 00:09:47.925
(Applause)

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:51.372
Thank you, appreciate it.

00:09:53.501 --> 00:09:54.658
Thanks, guys.

00:09:57.928 --> 00:10:00.772
Chris Anderson: So help
me out on one thing,

00:10:00.796 --> 00:10:03.424
because there've been a few
augmented reality demos

00:10:03.448 --> 00:10:06.154
shown over the last year or so out there.

00:10:06.178 --> 00:10:08.587
And there's sometimes
a debate among technologists

00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:12.316
about, are we really seeing
the real thing on-screen?

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.080
There's this issue of field of view,

00:10:14.104 --> 00:10:17.570
that somehow the technology
is showing a broader view

00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:20.515
than you would actually see
wearing the glasses.

00:10:21.086 --> 00:10:22.809
Were we seeing the real deal there?

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:24.246
MG: Absolutely the real deal.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.427
Not only that,

00:10:25.451 --> 00:10:28.788
we took extra measures to shoot it
with a GoPro through the actual lens

00:10:28.812 --> 00:10:30.865
in the various videos
that you've seen here.

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:33.465
We want to try to simulate
the experience for the world

00:10:33.489 --> 00:10:35.682
that we're actually seeing
through the glasses,

00:10:35.706 --> 00:10:36.857
and not cut any corners.

00:10:36.881 --> 00:10:38.905
CA: Thank you so much for showing us that.

00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:40.754
MG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that.
