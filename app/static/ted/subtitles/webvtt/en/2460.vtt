00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.080
In 1962 at Rice University,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.176
JFK told the country about a dream he had,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.096
a dream to put a person on the moon
by the end of the decade.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.520
The eponymous moonshot.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.696
No one knew if it was possible to do

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.080
but he made sure a plan was put in place
to do it if it was possible.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.336
That's how great dreams are.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.816
Great dreams aren't just visions,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.520
they're visions coupled to strategies
for making them real.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.496
I have the incredible good fortune
to work at a moonshot factory.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.816
At X -- formerly called Google X --

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.536
you'll find an aerospace engineer
working alongside a fashion designer

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.280
and former military ops commanders
brainstorming with laser experts.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.536
These inventors, engineers and makers
are dreaming up technologies

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.320
that we hope can make the world
a wonderful place.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.736
We use the word "moonshots"
to remind us to keep our visions big --

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.456
to keep dreaming.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.936
And we use the word "factory"
to remind ourselves

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.056
that we want to have concrete visions --

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.376
concrete plans to make them real.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.336
Here's our moonshot blueprint.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.576
Number one:

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.016
we want to find
a huge problem in the world

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.296
that affects many millions of people.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.816
Number two:

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.640
we want to find or propose a radical
solution for solving that problem.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.856
And then number three:

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.856
there has to be some reason to believe

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.936
that the technology
for such a radical solution

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.400
could actually be built.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.496
But I have a secret for you.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.760
The moonshot factory is a messy place.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.416
But rather than avoid the mess,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.976
pretend it's not there,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.840
we've tried to make that our strength.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.896
We spend most of our time breaking things

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.880
and trying to prove that we're wrong.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.960
That's it, that's the secret.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.216
Run at all the hardest
parts of the problem first.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.295
Get excited and cheer,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.759
"Hey! How are we going
to kill our project today?"

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.640
We've got this interesting balance going

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.096
where we allow our unchecked
optimism to fuel our visions.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.576
But then we also harness
enthusiastic skepticism

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.640
to breathe life, breathe reality
into those visions.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.256
I want to show you a few of the projects

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.976
that we've had to leave behind
on the cutting room floor,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.576
and also a few of the gems

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.296
that at least so far,
have not only survived that process,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.080
but have been accelerated by it.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.176
Last year we killed a project
in automated vertical farming.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.216
This is some of the lettuce that we grew.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.816
One in nine people in the world
suffers from undernourishment.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.936
So this is a moonshot
that needs to happen.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.616
Vertical farming uses 10 times less water

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.776
and a hundred times less land
than conventional farming.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.960
And because you can grow the food
close to where it's consumed,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.880
you don't have to
transport it large distances.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.456
We made progress in a lot of the areas

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.096
like automated harvesting
and efficient lighting.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.576
But unfortunately,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.656
we couldn't get staple crops
like grains and rice to grow this way.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.200
So we killed the project.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.480
Here's another huge problem.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.416
We pay enormous costs in resources
and environmental damage

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.656
to ship goods worldwide.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.256
Economic development
of landlocked countries

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.856
is limited by lack
of shipping infrastructure.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.496
The radical solution?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.720
A lighter-than-air,
variable-buoyancy cargo ship.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.616
This has the potential to lower,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.256
at least overall,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.816
the cost, time and carbon
footprint of shipping

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.120
without needing runways.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.936
We came up with this clever set
of technical breakthroughs

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.896
that together might make it possible
for us to lower the cost enough

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.056
that we could actually make these ships --

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.720
inexpensively enough in volume.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.079
But however cheap they would
have been to make in volume

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.176
it turned out that it was going to cost
close to 200 million dollars

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.320
to design and build the first one.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.336
200 million dollars
is just way too expensive.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.176
Because X is structured
with these tight feedback loops

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.856
of making mistakes
and learning and new designs,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.616
we can't spend 200 million dollars

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.376
to get the first data point

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.960
about whether we're
on the right track or not.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.936
If there's an Achilles' heel
in one our projects,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.256
we want to know it now, up front,
not way down the road.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.960
So we killed this project, too.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.616
Discovering a major flaw in a project

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.776
doesn't always mean
that it ends the project.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.976
Sometimes it actually gets us
onto a more productive path.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.936
This is our fully self-driving
vehicle prototype,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.120
which we built without
a steering wheel or break pedal.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.200
But that wasn't actually
our goal when we started.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.656
With 1.2 million people dying
on the roads globally every year,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.496
building a car that drives itself
was a natural moonshot to take.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.120
Three and a half years ago,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.496
when we had these Lexus,
retrofitted, self-driving cars in testing,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.176
they were doing so well,
we gave them out to other Googlers

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.440
to find out what they thought
of the experience.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.256
And what we discovered

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.896
was that our plan to have the cars
do almost all the driving

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.816
and just hand over to the users
in case of emergency

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.920
was a really bad plan.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.856
It wasn't safe

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.016
because the users didn't do their job.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.480
They didn't stay alert

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.216
in case the car needed
to hand control back to them.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.256
This was a major crisis for the team.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.320
It sent them back to the drawing board.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.680
And they came up
with a beautiful, new perspective.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.320
Aim for a car where
you're truly a passenger.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.536
You tell the car where you want to go,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.816
you push a button

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.000
and it takes you
from point A to point B by itself.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.016
We're really grateful

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.576
that we had this insight
as early on in the project as we did.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.560
And it's shaped everything
we've done since then.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.536
And now our cars have self-driven
more than 1.4 million miles,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.176
and they're out everyday

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.240
on the streets of Mountain View,
California and Austin, Texas.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.976
The cars team shifted their perspective.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.056
This is one of X's mantras.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.880
Sometimes shifting your perspective
is more powerful than being smart.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.376
Take wind energy.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.736
It's one of my favorite examples
of perspective shifting.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.616
There's no way that we're going to build

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.040
a better standard wind turbine
than the experts in that industry.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.616
But we found a way
to get up higher into the sky,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.456
and so get access to faster,
more consistent winds,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.136
and so more energy without needing
hundreds of tons of steel to get there.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.496
Our Makani energy kite
rises up from its perch

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.536
by spinning up those
propellers along its wing.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.880
And it pulls out a tether as it rises,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.536
pulling energy up through the tether.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.416
Once the tether's all the way out,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.600
it goes into crosswind circles in the sky.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.680
And now those propellers that lifted it up
have become flying turbines.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.080
And that sends energy
back down the tether.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.736
We haven't yet found
a way to kill this project.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.856
And the longer it survives that pressure,
the more excited we get

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.336
that this could become
a cheaper and more deployable form

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.280
of wind energy for the world.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.560
Probably the craziest sounding project
we have is Project Loon.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.856
We're trying to make
balloon-powered Internet.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.960
A network of balloons in the stratosphere

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.896
that beam an internet connection down
to rural and remote areas of the world.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.816
This could bring online
as many as four billion more people,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.080
who today have little
or no internet connection.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.015
But you can't just take a cell tower,

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.936
strap it to a balloon
and stick it in the sky.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.336
The winds are too strong,
it would be blown away.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.760
And the balloons are too high up
to tie it to the ground.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.240
Here comes the crazy moment.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.096
What if, instead,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.336
we let the balloons drift

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.200
and we taught them how to sail the winds
to go where the needed to go?

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.896
It turns out the stratosphere has winds

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.016
that are going in quite different
speeds and directions in thin strata.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.920
So we hoped that using smart algorithms
and wind data from around the world,

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.256
we could maneuver the balloons a bit,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.376
getting them to go up and down
just a tiny bit in the stratosphere

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.016
to grab those winds going
in those different directions and speeds.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.336
The idea is to have enough balloons

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.216
so as one balloon floats out of your area,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.976
there's another balloon
ready to float into place,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.616
handing off the internet connection,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.096
just like your phone
hands off between cell towers

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.760
as you drive down the freeway.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.176
We get how crazy that vision sounds --

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.936
there's the name of the project
to remind us of that.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.296
So since 2012,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:57.096
the Loon team has prioritized
the work that seems the most difficult

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.960
and so the most likely
to kill their project.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.456
The first thing that they did

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.696
was try to get a Wi-Fi connection
from a balloon in the stratosphere

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.840
down to an antenna on the ground.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.936
It worked.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.675
And I promise you there were bets
that it wasn't going to.

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:15.939
So we kept going.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.256
Could we get the balloon
to talk directly to handsets,

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.640
so that we didn't need the antenna
as an intermediary receiver?

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.920
Yeah.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.296
Could we get the balloon
bandwidth high enough

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.056
so it was a real Internet connection?

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.040
So that people could have
something more than just SMS?

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.456
The early tests weren't even
a megabit per second,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.896
but now we can do
up to 15 megabits per second.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.240
Enough to watch a TED Talk.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.936
Could we get the balloons
to talk to each other through the sky

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.816
so that we could reach our signal
deeper into rural areas?

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.376
Check.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:04.056
Could we get balloons the size of a house
to stay up for more than 100 days,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.376
while costing less than five percent

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.960
of what traditional, long-life
balloons have cost to make?

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.536
Yes. In the end.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.600
But I promise you, you name it,
we had to try it to get there.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.320
We made round, silvery balloons.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.640
We made giant pillow-shaped balloons.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.280
We made balloons the size of a blue whale.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.376
We busted a lot of balloons.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.016
(Laughter)

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.096
Since one of the things that was
most likely to kill the Loon project

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.176
was whether we could guide
the balloons through the sky,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.960
one of our most important experiments
was putting a balloon inside a balloon.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.080
So there are two compartments here,
one with air and then one with helium.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.216
The balloon pumps air in
to make itself heavier,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.600
or lets air out to make it lighter.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.816
And these weight changes
allow it to rise or fall,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.576
and that simple movement of the balloon
is its steering mechanism.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.256
It floats up or down,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.200
hoping to grab winds going in the speed
and direction that it wants.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.120
But is that good enough
for it to navigate through the world?

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.336
Barely at first,

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.736
but better all the time.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.840
This particular balloon,
our latest balloon,

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.240
can navigate a two-mile
vertical stretch of sky

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.336
and can sail itself to within 500 meters
of where it wants to go

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.960
from 20,000 kilometers away.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.576
We have lots more to do

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.176
in terms of fine-tuning
the system and reducing costs.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.216
But last year,
a balloon built inexpensively

00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.376
went around the world
19 times over 187 days.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.840
So we're going to keep going.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.440
(Applause)

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.776
Our balloons today

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.160
are doing pretty much everything
a complete system needs to do.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.016
We're in discussions
with telcos around the world,

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.376
and we're going to fly
over places like Indonesia

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.136
for real service testing this year.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.720
This probably all sounds
too good to be true,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.000
and you're right.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.056
Being audacious

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.736
and working on big, risky things

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.240
makes people inherently uncomfortable.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.120
You cannot yell at people
and force them to fail fast.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.536
People resist. They worry.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.616
"What will happen to me if I fail?

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.120
Will people laugh at me?

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.320
Will I be fired?"

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.576
I started with our secret.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.480
I'm going to leave you
with how we actually make it happen.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.936
The only way to get people
to work on big, risky things --

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.696
audacious ideas --

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.656
and have them run at all
the hardest parts of the problem first,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.560
is if you make that the path
of least resistance for them.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.240
We work hard at X to make it safe to fail.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.936
Teams kill their ideas
as soon as the evidence is on the table

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.520
because they're rewarded for it.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.976
They get applause from their peers.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.880
Hugs and high fives
from their manager, me in particular.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.656
They get promoted for it.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:45.936
We have bonused every single person
on teams that ended their projects,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.976
from teams as small as two
to teams of more than 30.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.920
We believe in dreams
at the moonshot factory.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.336
But enthusiastic skepticism

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.816
is not the enemy of boundless optimism.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.520
It's optimism's perfect partner.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.600
It unlocks the potential in every idea.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.480
We can create the future
that's in our dreams.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.696
Thank you very much.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:19.742
(Applause)
