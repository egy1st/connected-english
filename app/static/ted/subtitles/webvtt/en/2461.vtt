WEBVTT

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.460
Thousands of years from now,

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:06.325
we'll look back at the first
century of computing

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.398
as a fascinating but very peculiar time --

00:00:11.096 --> 00:00:16.102
the only time in history where humans
were reduced to live in 2D space,

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:20.045
interacting with technology
as if we were machines;

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:25.286
a singular, 100-year period
in the vastness of time

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.998
where humans communicated,

00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:30.673
were entertained and managed their lives

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.371
from behind a screen.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:37.976
Today, we spend most of our time
tapping and looking at screens.

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:42.349
What happened to interacting
with each other?

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.711
I don't know about you, but I feel limited

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:49.283
inside this 2D world
of monitors and pixels.

00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:51.816
And it is this very limitation

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.256
and my desire to connect with people

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.268
that inspires me as a creator.

00:00:56.292 --> 00:00:59.643
Put simply: I want
to create a new reality,

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:05.374
a reality where technology brings
us infinitely closer to each other,

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:08.588
a reality where people, not devices,

00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:10.080
are the center of everything.

00:01:10.998 --> 00:01:17.177
I dream of a reality where technology
senses what we see, touch and feel;

00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:21.035
a reality where technology
no longer gets in our way,

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:23.804
but instead embraces who we are.

00:01:24.328 --> 00:01:25.932
I dream of technology

00:01:26.728 --> 00:01:28.447
on a human path.

00:01:28.878 --> 00:01:30.886
We have all experienced technology

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.212
that enables people
to act more like people,

00:01:34.236 --> 00:01:39.013
products that enable natural interactions,
voice controls or biometrics.

00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:46.624
This is the next step in the evolution.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.285
This is Microsoft HoloLens,

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.882
the first fully untethered
holographic computer.

00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:57.837
Devices like this will bring
3D holographic content

00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:59.780
right into our world,

00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:01.861
enhancing the way we experience life

00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:04.598
beyond our ordinary range of perceptions.

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:09.257
Now, I'm not thinking
about a distant future.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.458
I'm talking about today.

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:15.102
We are already seeing
car companies like Volvo

00:02:15.126 --> 00:02:18.053
designing cars differently with HoloLens;

00:02:18.077 --> 00:02:22.808
universities like Case Western
redefining the way medical students learn;

00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:24.252
and my personal favorite,

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:30.091
NASA is using HoloLens
to let scientists explore planets

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:31.345
holographically.

00:02:31.932 --> 00:02:33.218
Now, this is important.

00:02:34.194 --> 00:02:36.636
By bringing holograms into our world,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.285
I'm not just talking about a new device
or a better computer.

00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:45.801
I'm talking about freeing ourselves
from the 2D confines

00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:48.308
of traditional computing.

00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:50.937
Put it this way:

00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:55.181
temporally adjusted, we're like
cave people in computer terms.

00:02:55.878 --> 00:02:57.792
We've barely discovered charcoal

00:02:57.816 --> 00:03:01.996
and started drawing
the first stick figures in our cave.

00:03:02.925 --> 00:03:07.250
Now, this is the perspective
I apply to my work every single day.

00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:09.967
And now for the next few minutes,

00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:14.290
I invite all of you to apply
the same perspective

00:03:14.314 --> 00:03:15.707
to the journey ahead of us.

00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:22.381
Now, as I put this HoloLens on,

00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:24.584
let me explain the setup a little bit.

00:03:24.608 --> 00:03:29.980
It's probably the most risky demo
we have ever done on any stage

00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:31.238
with HoloLens,

00:03:31.262 --> 00:03:34.562
and I can't think of a better place
to do it than here at TED.

00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:38.995
Momentarily, I am going
to be seeing holograms

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.341
right on this stage,

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:42.621
just as clearly as I can see all of you.

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:46.283
Now at the same time,
we have also this special camera

00:03:46.307 --> 00:03:48.003
that just walked in onstage

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:51.259
so that all of you can share
in this experience with me

00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:52.695
up on all the monitors.

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:55.272
So let's start our journey.

00:03:55.296 --> 00:03:57.732
And what better place
to begin our journey,

00:03:57.756 --> 00:04:00.859
than in the computer cave of 2D.

00:04:02.978 --> 00:04:07.169
Let's explore the world
all around us with this new lens,

00:04:07.193 --> 00:04:10.607
and understand the computer world
from a brand new perspective.

00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:16.123
The computer universe
is both marvelous and primitive.

00:04:16.933 --> 00:04:19.548
It's a universe based on causality.

00:04:20.112 --> 00:04:23.280
As developers, we dream
the different causes

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.580
and then we program the different effects.

00:04:26.084 --> 00:04:28.965
Double click on an icon, that's a cause.

00:04:29.582 --> 00:04:32.243
Open an application, that's an effect.

00:04:33.264 --> 00:04:37.511
Now when we compare this
to our physical universe,

00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:39.550
it is overly constraining,

00:04:39.574 --> 00:04:42.018
because our universe is not digital.

00:04:42.747 --> 00:04:44.638
Our universe is analog.

00:04:44.662 --> 00:04:48.777
Our universe doesn't think
in terms of zero or one,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.979
true or false, or black or white.

00:04:52.663 --> 00:04:56.909
We exist in a world
governed by quantum physics,

00:04:56.933 --> 00:05:01.276
a universe of zero and one
both at the same time,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.392
a reality based on infinite
probabilities and shades of gray.

00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:10.946
You can see how these two worlds collide.

00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:17.051
So why are screens so pervasive
in our analog life?

00:05:18.366 --> 00:05:20.967
We see screens from the moment we wake up,

00:05:20.991 --> 00:05:22.672
to the moment we fall asleep.

00:05:23.174 --> 00:05:24.334
Why?

00:05:24.666 --> 00:05:27.821
I think it's because computers
give us superpowers.

00:05:28.393 --> 00:05:32.099
Within the digital universe,
we have the power to displace space

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.874
and the power to displace time.

00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:37.717
It doesn't matter if you're using
technology for entertainment,

00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:39.966
productivity or communication.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.861
Think of it this way:

00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:43.265
let's all go home tonight

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.955
and watch our favorite show on television.

00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:50.004
This is theater -- time
and space displaced.

00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:52.734
As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk,

00:05:52.758 --> 00:05:56.075
I'm going to immediately call
my lovely family in Seattle.

00:05:59.261 --> 00:06:01.142
That's displacement of space.

00:06:02.088 --> 00:06:04.311
Now, these are such great superpowers

00:06:04.335 --> 00:06:07.284
that we put up with
the two-dimensional limitations

00:06:07.308 --> 00:06:09.097
of our current digital world.

00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:10.636
But what if we didn't have to?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.360
What if we could have
these same digital powers

00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:17.005
in our world?

00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:20.362
You can already see glimmers of this,

00:06:20.386 --> 00:06:23.038
but I believe our children's children

00:06:23.062 --> 00:06:27.005
will grow up in a world
devoid of 2D technology.

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:30.494
It's remarkable to dream of this world,

00:06:30.518 --> 00:06:34.707
a world where technology
truly understands us --

00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:37.261
where we live, work and communicate --

00:06:37.285 --> 00:06:40.407
with tools that enhance
the human experience,

00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:44.618
not machines that limit our humanity.

00:06:46.642 --> 00:06:47.896
So how do we get there?

00:06:49.182 --> 00:06:53.272
For me, the answer required
looking at the problem

00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:54.771
from a different perspective.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.736
It required sensing the world
from the perspective of a machine.

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:06.031
If you're a machine trying
to sense our world,

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:08.359
how would you actually
break the problem down?

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.832
You'd probably try to classify things

00:07:11.856 --> 00:07:13.021
as a human,

00:07:14.205 --> 00:07:15.380
an environment

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:18.189
or an object.

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:24.202
But how would that machine
then interact with reality?

00:07:25.063 --> 00:07:26.688
And I can think of three ways.

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.878
First, as a machine,

00:07:28.902 --> 00:07:32.820
I would observe or I would input reality.

00:07:33.847 --> 00:07:36.529
Speech recognition
and biometric authentication

00:07:36.553 --> 00:07:39.813
are great examples of a machine
interacting with humans

00:07:39.837 --> 00:07:41.552
from an input perspective.

00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:44.772
Secondly, as a machine,

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:49.907
I could place digital information,
or output information,

00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:51.096
into reality.

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:56.611
Holograms are examples of a machine
interacting with an environment

00:07:56.635 --> 00:07:58.095
from an output perspective.

00:07:58.968 --> 00:08:01.086
Finally, as a machine,

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.642
I could exchange energy
with the world via haptics.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.392
Now, imagine being able to feel
the temperature of a virtual object,

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:13.635
or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:16.492
and having it push you back
with equal force.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:18.676
With this perspective,

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:24.148
we are able to collapse reality
into a simple matrix.

00:08:24.172 --> 00:08:25.323
Now here's a secret:

00:08:25.347 --> 00:08:27.405
as an engineer, I get really excited

00:08:27.429 --> 00:08:30.283
anytime I can reduce
something to the matrix.

00:08:30.783 --> 00:08:32.822
From self-driving cars

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.435
to smartphones

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:36.781
to this holographic computer on my head,

00:08:36.805 --> 00:08:40.587
machines are becoming capable
of understanding our world.

00:08:41.293 --> 00:08:43.828
And they are starting to interact with us

00:08:43.852 --> 00:08:46.967
in significantly more personal ways.

00:08:48.197 --> 00:08:51.822
Now, imagine having granular control

00:08:51.846 --> 00:08:53.682
over everything in the world.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.465
Move the dial one way,

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.145
and you get reality.

00:09:01.268 --> 00:09:03.351
Move the dial the other way,

00:09:05.582 --> 00:09:08.103
and you get virtual reality.

00:09:09.748 --> 00:09:14.839
Now, imagine dialing
your entire environment

00:09:14.863 --> 00:09:17.996
between virtual and real worlds.

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:23.877
I love it down here.

00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:28.130
Now, imagine if I could look at all of you

00:09:28.154 --> 00:09:31.564
and dial from real humans into elves.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.524
When technology truly
understands our world,

00:09:35.548 --> 00:09:39.195
it will again transform
the ways we interact,

00:09:39.219 --> 00:09:42.147
the ways we work and the ways we play.

00:09:47.238 --> 00:09:48.949
Less than half a century ago,

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.877
two courageous men landed on the moon,

00:09:52.696 --> 00:09:56.507
using computers that were less powerful
than the phones in your pockets.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.221
Six hundred million humans watched them

00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:03.008
on grainy, black-and-white televisions.

00:10:03.579 --> 00:10:04.737
And the world?

00:10:05.096 --> 00:10:07.491
The world was mesmerized.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.356
Now imagine how our children
and their children

00:10:12.986 --> 00:10:16.523
will experience the continued
exploration of space

00:10:16.547 --> 00:10:20.498
with technology
that understands this world.

00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:25.689
We already live in a world where
real-time universal translators exist.

00:10:26.174 --> 00:10:31.309
And I can squint, and I can already
see holographic telepresence

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:32.507
in our near future.

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:36.158
In fact, since we've been lucky
with our demo so far,

00:10:36.182 --> 00:10:38.491
let's try doing something else
even more crazy.

00:10:39.153 --> 00:10:41.906
I invite you to experience,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.967
for the first time anywhere in the world,

00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:47.476
here on the TED stage,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.818
a real-life holographic teleportation,

00:10:51.953 --> 00:10:55.660
between me and my friend,
Dr. Jeffrey Norris,

00:10:55.684 --> 00:10:58.482
from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:00.540
Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff.

00:11:02.514 --> 00:11:03.680
Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex.

00:11:03.704 --> 00:11:06.807
Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked.
How are you doing today, Jeff?

00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:08.934
(Applause)

00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.022
JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:14.498
AK: So, can you tell us a little bit,
Jeff, about where you are?

00:11:16.197 --> 00:11:19.198
JN: Well, I'm actually in three places.

00:11:19.222 --> 00:11:22.103
I'm standing in a room across the street,

00:11:22.127 --> 00:11:25.131
while I'm standing on this stage with you,

00:11:25.155 --> 00:11:29.957
while I'm standing on Mars,
a hundred million miles away.

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:33.673
AK: Wow, a hundred million
miles away. This is crazy!

00:11:33.697 --> 00:11:36.483
Can you tell us a little bit more
about where all this data

00:11:36.507 --> 00:11:38.196
from Mars is coming from?

00:11:40.005 --> 00:11:41.457
JN: Absolutely.

00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:45.567
This is a precise
holographic replica of Mars,

00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:48.771
built from data captured
by the Curiosity Mars Rover,

00:11:48.795 --> 00:11:51.850
that I can explore as easily
as a place on Earth.

00:11:53.056 --> 00:11:56.310
Humans are natural explorers.

00:11:56.334 --> 00:11:58.895
We can instantly
understand an environment,

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.666
just by being present in it.

00:12:01.773 --> 00:12:03.793
We've built tools like our Mars Rover

00:12:03.817 --> 00:12:07.417
to extend our vision
and lengthen our reach.

00:12:07.441 --> 00:12:09.552
But for decades,

00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:13.541
we've explored from a seat
behind screens and keyboards.

00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:17.628
Now, we're leaping over all of that,

00:12:17.652 --> 00:12:20.855
over the giant antennas
and the relay satellites

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:23.154
and the vastness between worlds

00:12:23.178 --> 00:12:28.286
to take our first steps on this landscape
as if we were truly there.

00:12:29.502 --> 00:12:32.090
Today, a group of scientists
on our mission

00:12:32.114 --> 00:12:35.498
are seeing Mars as never before --

00:12:35.522 --> 00:12:38.839
an alien world made
a little more familiar,

00:12:38.863 --> 00:12:42.418
because they're finally exploring it
as humans should.

00:12:43.225 --> 00:12:47.911
But our dreams don't have to end
with making it just like being there.

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:50.349
When we dial this real world
to the virtual,

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:52.672
we can do magical things.

00:12:53.092 --> 00:12:55.483
We can see in invisible wavelengths

00:12:55.507 --> 00:12:58.292
or teleport to the top of a mountain.

00:12:58.882 --> 00:13:03.447
Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals
in a rock just by touching it.

00:13:05.003 --> 00:13:06.661
We're taking the first steps.

00:13:07.177 --> 00:13:10.927
But we want the whole world
to join us in taking the next,

00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:13.714
because this is not a journey for a few,

00:13:13.738 --> 00:13:15.253
but for all of us.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.225
AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing.

00:13:18.249 --> 00:13:20.986
Thank you so much for joining us
on the TED stage today.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:27.723
(Applause)

00:13:27.747 --> 00:13:30.459
JN: Thank you Alex, bye bye.

00:13:30.483 --> 00:13:31.656
AK: Bye, Jeff.

00:13:38.562 --> 00:13:44.866
(Applause)

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:49.121
I dream about this future

00:13:49.145 --> 00:13:50.873
every single day.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.831
I take inspiration from our ancestors.

00:13:54.855 --> 00:13:57.380
We used to live in tribes
where we interacted,

00:13:57.404 --> 00:13:59.800
communicated and worked together.

00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:05.502
We are all beginning to build technology
that will enable us to return

00:14:05.526 --> 00:14:08.849
to the humanity that brought us
where we are today --

00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:14.536
technology that will let us stop living
inside this 2D world

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.568
of monitors and pixels,

00:14:16.592 --> 00:14:21.339
and let us start remembering
what it feels like

00:14:21.363 --> 00:14:24.949
to live in our 3D world.

00:14:25.938 --> 00:14:29.526
It's a phenomenal time to be human.

00:14:30.147 --> 00:14:31.320
Thank you.

00:14:31.344 --> 00:14:36.413
(Applause)

00:14:36.437 --> 00:14:38.934
Helen Walters: Thanks so much.
I have some questions.

00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.109
AK: OK.

00:14:40.133 --> 00:14:42.555
HW: So there's been
some talk in the press.

00:14:42.579 --> 00:14:45.605
And I'll just ask you straight,
then we have a straight answer.

00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:48.311
There's been talk about the difference
between the demos

00:14:48.335 --> 00:14:50.517
and the reality of the commercial product.

00:14:50.541 --> 00:14:52.492
Talk about this field of view issue.

00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:56.835
Is this type of experience what someone
who buys the product will get?

00:14:56.859 --> 00:14:58.818
AK: It's a great question,

00:14:58.842 --> 00:15:01.493
Or, said better, this is a question
we've been receiving

00:15:01.517 --> 00:15:04.180
in the media for possibly the last year.

00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:06.951
If you do your research,
I haven't answered that question.

00:15:06.975 --> 00:15:08.381
I've purposely ignored it,

00:15:08.405 --> 00:15:10.919
because ultimately,
it's the wrong question to ask.

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:17.959
That's the equivalent of me showing
holograms to someone for the first time,

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:21.793
and you then saying,
"What's the size of your television?"

00:15:21.817 --> 00:15:24.511
The field of view for the product
is almost irrelevant.

00:15:24.535 --> 00:15:28.033
What we should be talking about
is the density of lights,

00:15:28.057 --> 00:15:29.843
or radiance, that shows up.

00:15:29.867 --> 00:15:33.238
Better said, what the angular resolution
is of the things that you see.

00:15:33.262 --> 00:15:35.262
So from that perspective, what you saw --

00:15:35.286 --> 00:15:37.349
you know, the camera
is wearing a HoloLens.

00:15:37.373 --> 00:15:39.357
So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.

00:15:39.381 --> 00:15:42.947
HW: But the camera has a different lens
on it than our eye. Right?

00:15:42.971 --> 00:15:45.891
AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it.

00:15:45.915 --> 00:15:48.836
It's seeing a much wider view
than the human eye is.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.165
So if you think about the points of light
that show up radially

00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:54.703
from the vision of the camera,

00:15:54.727 --> 00:15:56.448
which is the thing that matters:

00:15:56.472 --> 00:15:59.030
how many points of light
can I get in a given volume?

00:15:59.054 --> 00:16:03.181
That's the same as I get
on this HoloLens as I will on that one.

00:16:03.205 --> 00:16:08.186
Now, this camera sees
a much wider view of the world, right?

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.433
HW: Jesus Christ!

00:16:09.457 --> 00:16:10.458
(Laughter)

00:16:10.482 --> 00:16:12.561
AK: He did show up!
I told you he'd show up.

00:16:12.585 --> 00:16:13.784
Come this way.

00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:15.672
(Laughter)

00:16:15.696 --> 00:16:16.918
HW: Oh, shit.

00:16:17.723 --> 00:16:19.731
AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris.

00:16:20.199 --> 00:16:23.817
HW: I knew something was happening,
but I really wasn't sure what.

00:16:23.841 --> 00:16:25.588
AK: So in short: to be super crisp,

00:16:25.612 --> 00:16:28.628
the camera that you see on the screen
has a wider field of view

00:16:28.652 --> 00:16:29.850
than the human eye.

00:16:29.874 --> 00:16:33.081
But the angular resolution
of the holograms that you see,

00:16:33.105 --> 00:16:37.074
the points of light per unit of area,

00:16:37.098 --> 00:16:38.264
are actually the same.

00:16:38.288 --> 00:16:41.427
HW: So you spent -- Jeff,
I'll get to you in a minute --

00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:46.031
so you spent a lot of time
mapping the stage --

00:16:46.055 --> 00:16:47.405
AK: That's right.

00:16:47.429 --> 00:16:48.603
HW: So help me out here:

00:16:48.627 --> 00:16:50.596
if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home,

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.557
I don't need to map my apartment, right?

00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:56.694
AK: The HoloLens maps in real time
at about five frames per second,

00:16:56.718 --> 00:16:59.119
with this technology
that we call spatial mapping.

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:01.170
So in your home, as soon as you put it on,

00:17:01.194 --> 00:17:04.124
holograms will start showing up,
and you'll start placing them

00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:05.939
and they'll start learning your home.

00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:09.472
In a stage environment where we're trying
to get something on my head

00:17:09.496 --> 00:17:11.647
to communicate with something over there

00:17:11.671 --> 00:17:15.642
with all of the wireless connectivity
that usually brings all conferences down,

00:17:15.666 --> 00:17:19.630
we don't take the risk
of trying to do this live.

00:17:20.027 --> 00:17:23.081
So what we do is pre-map the stage
at five frames per second

00:17:23.105 --> 00:17:25.129
with the same spatial-mapping technology

00:17:25.153 --> 00:17:27.140
that you'll use with the product at home,

00:17:27.164 --> 00:17:28.315
and then we store it,

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.793
so that when there's shenanigans
of wireless in an environment like this,

00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:34.834
between the camera's HoloLens
and the one on my head,

00:17:34.858 --> 00:17:36.451
we don't have things disappear.

00:17:36.475 --> 00:17:39.904
Because ultimately, the holograms
are coming from this HoloLens,

00:17:39.928 --> 00:17:41.968
and that one is just viewing the HoloLens.

00:17:41.992 --> 00:17:43.917
So if I lose connectivity,

00:17:43.941 --> 00:17:46.468
you would stop seeing
beautiful things on the screen.

00:17:46.492 --> 00:17:48.055
HW: And it was beautiful.

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:49.254
Um ... Jeff?

00:17:50.538 --> 00:17:51.713
JN: Yes?

00:17:52.367 --> 00:17:54.028
HW: Hi.

00:17:55.543 --> 00:17:56.794
AK: I'll take a step back.

00:17:56.818 --> 00:17:59.748
HW: So Jeff, you were on Mars,

00:17:59.772 --> 00:18:02.279
you were here, you were
in a room across the street.

00:18:02.303 --> 00:18:06.505
Tell me more about the fact that,
with holograms, you have sight

00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:09.230
but you don't have touch,
you don't have smell.

00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:11.790
Is this scientifically useful now?

00:18:12.824 --> 00:18:14.552
That's my question for a hologram.

00:18:15.044 --> 00:18:16.840
JN: Thanks for the question.

00:18:16.864 --> 00:18:19.377
Absolutely, I believe
that these technologies

00:18:19.401 --> 00:18:21.425
are scientifically useful right now,

00:18:21.449 --> 00:18:26.053
and that's why we're using them
in multiple parts of our work at NASA.

00:18:26.077 --> 00:18:29.696
So we're using it to improve
the ways that we explore Mars.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.181
We're also using it for our astronauts
on the space station.

00:18:33.205 --> 00:18:35.657
We're even using it now to design

00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:37.866
the next generation of our spacecraft.

00:18:38.834 --> 00:18:41.868
HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away.
Thank you very much.

00:18:41.892 --> 00:18:44.101
(Laughter)

00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:47.612
Alex, really, that was amazing.
Thank you so much.

00:18:47.636 --> 00:18:48.794
AK: Thank you.

00:18:48.818 --> 00:18:50.079
HW: Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:50.103 --> 00:18:52.669
(Applause)
