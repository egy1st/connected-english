WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.640
It began with one question:

00:00:05.222 --> 00:00:10.360
If Africa was a bar, what would
your country be drinking or doing?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.456
I kicked it off with a guess
about South Africa,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.536
which wasn't exactly
according to the rules

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.080
because South Africa's not my country.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.896
But alluding to the country's
continual attempts

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.256
to build a postracial society

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.576
after being ravaged
for decades by apartheid,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.936
I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa
would be drinking all kinds of alcohol

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.320
and begging them
to get along in its stomach.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.656
And then I waited.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.136
And then I had that funny feeling
where I wondered if I crossed the line.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.336
So, I sent out a few other tweets
about my own country

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.920
and a few other African countries
I'm familiar with.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.656
And then I waited again,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.056
but this time

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.496
I read through almost every tweet
I had ever tweeted

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.256
to convince myself,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.376
no, to remind myself that I'm really funny

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.519
and that if nobody gets it, that's fine.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.176
But luckily,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.416
I didn't have to do that for very long.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.480
Very soon, people were participating.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.536
In fact, by the end of that week in July,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.096
the hashtag #ifafricawasabar

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.816
would have garnered around 60,000 tweets,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.496
lit up the continent

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.680
and made its way to publications
all over the world.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.400
People were using the hashtag
to do many different things.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.456
To poke fun at their stereotypes:

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.096
[#IfAfricaWasABar
Nigeria would be outside explaining

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.896
that he will pay the entrance fee,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.336
all he needs is
the bouncer's account details.]

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.576
(Laughter)

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.976
To criticize government spending:

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.576
[#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be
ordering bottles it can't pronounce

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.456
running a tab it won't be able to pay]

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.056
To make light of geopolitical tensions:

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.456
[#IfAfricaWasABar
South Sudan would be the new guy

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.696
with serious anger management issues.]

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.576
To remind us that even in Africa

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.056
there are some countries
we don't know exist:

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.456
[#IfAfricaWasABar
Lesotho would be that person

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.496
who nobody really knows
but is always in the pictures.]

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.776
And also to make fun of the countries
that don't think that they're in Africa:

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.816
[#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya,
Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.056
be like "What the hell
are we doing here?!!"]

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.976
(Laughter)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.096
And to note the countries
that had made a big turnaround:

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.136
[#ifAfricawasabar
Rwanda would be that girl

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.776
that comes with no money and no transport
but leaves drunk, happy and rich]

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.480
But most importantly,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.000
people were using the hashtag to connect.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.520
People were connecting
over their Africanness.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.296
So for one week in July,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.040
Twitter became a real African bar.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.976
And I was really thrilled,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.360
mainly because I realized
that Pan-Africanism could work,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.496
that we had before us,
between us, at our fingertips

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.976
a platform that just needed a small spark

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.400
to light in us a hunger for each other.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.296
My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.056
I'm 22 years old

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.400
and I am Pan-Africanist by birth.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.656
Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.056
because my parents are
from two different African countries.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.816
My father's from a country
called Botswana in southern Africa.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.856
It's only slightly bigger than Germany.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.976
This year we celebrate
our 50th year of stable democracy.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.576
And it has some very progressive
social policies.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.616
My mother's country
is the Kingdom of Swaziland.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.856
It's a very, very small country,
also in southern Africa.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.960
It is Africa's last complete monarchy.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.336
So it's been ruled by a king
and a royal family

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.776
in line with their tradition,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.120
for a very long time.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.856
On paper, these countries
seem very different.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.416
And when I was a kid,
I could see the difference.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.896
It rained a lot in one country,
it didn't rain quite as much in the other.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.296
But outside of that,
I didn't really realize

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.200
why it mattered that my parents
were from two different places.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.896
But it would go on
to have a very peculiar effect on me.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.656
You see, I was born in one country

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.079
and raised in the other.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.656
When we moved to Botswana,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.616
I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.216
and nothing else.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.936
So I was being introduced to my new home,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.216
my new cultural identity,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.256
as a complete outsider,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.536
incapable of comprehending
anything that was being said to me

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.976
by the family and country whose traditions
I was meant to move forward.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.216
But very soon, I would shed SiSwati.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.496
And when I would go back to Swaziland,

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.120
I would be constantly confronted
by how very non-Swazi I was becoming.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.496
Add to that my entry
into Africa's private school system,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.160
whose entire purpose
is to beat the Africanness out of you,

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.680
and I would have
a very peculiar adolescence.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.096
But I think that my interest
in ideas of identity was born here,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.376
in the strange intersection
of belonging to two places at once

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.496
but not really belonging
to either one very well

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.720
and belonging to this vast space
in between and around simultaneously.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.760
I became obsessed with the idea
of a shared African identity.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.336
Since then, I have continued
to read about politics

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.776
and geography and identity
and what all those things mean.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.536
I've also held on to a deep curiosity
about African philosophies.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.816
When I began to read,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.256
I gravitated towards the works
of black intellectuals

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.736
like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.576
who tackled complex ideas

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.656
like decolonization
and black consciousness.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.896
And when I thought, at 14,
that I had digested these grand ideas,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.976
I moved on to the speeches
of iconic African statesmen

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.016
like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.456
and Congo's Patrice Lumumba.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.856
I read every piece of African fiction
that I could get my hands on.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.536
So when Twitter came,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.736
I hopped on with the enthusiasm
of a teenage girl

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.240
whose friends are super, super bored
of hearing about all this random stuff.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.616
The year was 2011

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.696
and all over southern Africa
and the whole continent,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.616
affordable data packages
for smartphones and Internet surfing

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.456
became much easier to get.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.936
So my generation, we were sending
messages to each other on this platform

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.416
that just needed 140 characters
and a little bit of creativity.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.856
On long commutes to work,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.336
in lectures that some of us
should have been paying attention to,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.936
on our lunch breaks,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.976
we would communicate as much as we could

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.200
about the everyday realities
of being young and African.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.376
But of course, this luxury
was not available to everybody.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.096
So this meant that if you were
a teenage girl in Botswana

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.176
and you wanted
to have fun on the Internet,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.856
one, you had to tweet in English.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.656
Two, you had to follow more than just
the three other people you knew online.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.736
You had to follow South Africans,
Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.536
And suddenly, your whole world opened up.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.896
And my whole world did open up.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.736
I followed vibrant Africans
who were travelling around the continent,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.216
taking pictures of themselves

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.336
and posting them
under the hashtag #myafrica.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.816
Because at that time,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.896
if you were to search Africa
on Twitter or on Google

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.176
or any kind of social media,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.976
you would think that the entire continent
was just pictures of animals

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.496
and white guys drinking cocktails
in hotel resorts.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.776
(Laughter)

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.336
But Africans were using this platform

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.416
to take some kind of ownership
of the tourism sectors.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.456
It was Africans taking selfies
on the beaches of Nigeria.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.440
It was Africans
in cocktail bars in Nairobi.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.517
And these were the same Africans
that I began to meet

00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:07.976
in my own travels around the continent.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.976
We would discuss African literature,
politics, economic policy.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.136
But almost invariably, every single time,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.520
we would end up discussing Twitter.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.600
And that's when I realized what this was.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.416
We were standing in the middle
of something amazing,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.736
because for the first time ever

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.816
young Africans could discuss
the future of our continent in real time,

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.240
without the restriction of borders,
finances and watchful governments.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.655
Because the little known truth is

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.536
many Africans know a lot less
about other African countries

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.640
than some Westerners
might know about Africa as a whole.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.736
This is by accident,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.896
but sometimes, it's by design.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.856
For example, in apartheid South Africa,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.376
black South Africans
were constantly being bombarded

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.496
with this message that any country
ruled by black people

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.496
was destined for failure.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.056
And this was done to convince them

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.736
that they were much better off
under crushing white rule

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.120
than they were living
in a black and free nation.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.856
Add to that Africa's colonial,
archaic education system,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.856
which has been unthinkingly
carried over from the 1920s --

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.176
and at the age of 15,
I could name all the various causes

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.256
of the wars that had happened
in Europe in the past 200 years,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.120
but I couldn't name the president
of my neighboring country.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.496
And to me, this doesn't make any sense

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.536
because whether we like it or not,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.200
the fates of African people
are deeply intertwined.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.176
When disaster hits, when turmoil hits,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.336
we share the consequences.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.336
When Burundians flee political turmoil,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.696
they go to us,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.736
to other African countries.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.520
Africa has six of the world's
largest refugee centers.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.976
What was once a Burundian problem

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.016
becomes an African problem.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.616
So to me, there are no Sudanese problems

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.056
or South African problems
or Kenyan problems,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.656
only African problems

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.000
because eventually, we share the turmoil.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.336
So if we share the problems,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.600
why aren't we doing a better job
of sharing the successes?

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.416
How can we do that?

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.696
Well, in the long term,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.576
we can shoot towards
increasing inter-African trade,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.136
removing borders
and putting pressure on leaders

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.560
to fulfill regional agreements
they've already signed.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.336
But I think that the biggest way
for Africa to share its successes

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.800
is to foster something
I like to call social Pan-Africanism.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.176
Now, political Pan-Africanism
already exists,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.800
so I'm not inventing anything
totally new here.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.936
But political Pan-Africanism

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.496
is usually the African unity
of the political elite.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.856
And who does that benefit?

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.640
Well, African leaders, almost exclusively.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.176
No, what I'm talking about

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.280
is the Pan-Africanism
of the ordinary African.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.896
Young Africans like me,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.896
we are bursting with creative energy,

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.416
with innovative ideas.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.816
But with bad governance
and shaky institutions,

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.496
all of this potential could go to waste.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.056
On a continent where more
than a handful of leaders

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.936
have been in power longer

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.360
than the majority
of the populations has been alive,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.160
we are in desperate need of something new,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.480
something that works.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.960
And I think that thing
is social Pan-Africanism.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.696
My dream is that young Africans

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.256
stop allowing borders and circumstance
to suffocate our innovation.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.616
My dream is that when a young African
comes up with something brilliant,

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.056
they don't say, "Well,
this wouldn't work in my country,"

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.496
and then give up.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.176
My dream is that young Africans
begin to realize

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.520
that the entire continent
is our canvas, is our home.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.256
Using the Internet,
we can begin to think collaboratively,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.856
we can begin to innovate together.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.456
In Africa, we say,
"If you want to go fast, you go alone,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.336
but if you want to go far,
you go together."

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:26.120
And I believe that social Pan-Africanism
is how we can go far together.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.496
And this is already happening.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.496
Access to these online networks
has given young Africans

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.896
something we've always
had to violently take: a voice.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.816
We now have a platform.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.776
Before now, if you wanted
to hear from the youth in Africa,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.536
you waited for the 65-year-old
minister of youth --

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.856
(Laughter)

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.400
to wake up in the morning,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.040
take his heartburn medication

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.256
and then tell you the plans
he has for your generation

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.760
in 20 years time.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:04.336
Before now, if you wanted to be heard
by your possibly tyrannical government,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.736
you were pushed to protest,
suffer the consequences

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.416
and have your fingers crossed

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.960
that some Western paper somewhere
might make someone care.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.376
But now we have opportunities
to back each other up

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.616
in ways we never could before.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.376
We support South African students

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.016
who are marching against
ridiculously high tertiary fees.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.376
We support Zimbabwean women
who are marching to parliament.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.840
We support Angolan journalists
who are being illegally detained.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.696
For the first time ever,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.176
African pain and African aspiration

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.496
has the ability to be witnessed

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.136
by those who can empathize
with it the most:

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.440
other Africans.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.856
I believe that with
a social Pan-Africanist thinking

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.920
and using the Internet as a tool,

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.776
we can begin to rescue each other,

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.376
and ultimately, to rescue ourselves.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.616
Thank you.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:09.548
(Applause)
