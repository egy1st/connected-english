WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.816
It has been 128 years

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.400
since the last country
in the world abolished slavery

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.656
and 53 years

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.760
since Martin Luther King pronounced
his "I Have A Dream" speech.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.976
But we still live in a world

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.200
where the color of our skin
not only gives a first impression,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.760
but a lasting one that remains.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.376
I was born in a family full of colors.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.416
My father is the son of a maid

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.520
from whom he inherited
an intense dark chocolate tone.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.976
He was adopted by those
who I know as my grandparents.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.256
The matriarch, my grandma,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.880
has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.296
My grandpa was somewhere between
a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.960
like my uncle and my cousin.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.536
My mother is a cinnamon-skin
daughter of a native Brazilian,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.240
with a pinch of hazel and honey,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.856
and a man [who is]
a mix of coffee with milk,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.600
but with a lot of coffee.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.656
She has two sisters.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.576
One in a toasted-peanut skin

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.016
and the other,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.576
also adopted,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.496
more on the beige side,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.816
like a pancake.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.216
(Laughter)

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.096
Growing up in this family,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.720
color was never important for me.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.040
Outside home, however,
things were different soon.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.880
Color had many other meanings.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.936
I remember my first
drawing lessons in school

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.896
as a bunch of contradictory feelings.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.856
It was exciting and creative

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.680
but I never understood
the unique flesh-colored pencil.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.735
I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.536
My skin was brown,
and people said I was black.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.720
I was seven years old
with a mess of colors in my head.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.160
Later,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.376
when I took my cousin to school,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.800
I was usually taken for the nanny.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.976
By helping in the kitchen
at a friend's party,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.120
people thought I was the maid.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.696
I was even treated like a prostitute

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.240
just because I was walking alone
on the beach with European friends.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.256
And many times,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.856
visiting my grandma or friends
in upper class buildings,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.816
I was invited not to use
the main elevator.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.216
Because in the end,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.936
with this color and this hair,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.880
I cannot belong to some places.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.616
In some way,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.176
I get to used to it and accept part of it.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.000
However, something inside of me
keeps revolving and struggling.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.880
Years later I married a Spaniard.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.616
But not any Spaniard.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.536
I chose one with the skin color
of a lobster when sunburnt.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.576
(Laughter)

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.936
Since then, a new question
started to chase me.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.320
What will be the color of your children?

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.680
As you can understand,
this is my last concern.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.976
But thinking about it,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.936
with my previous background,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.056
my story led me to make
my personal exercise as a photographer.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.920
And that is how Humanae was born.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.576
Humanae is a pursuit
to highlight our true colors,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.256
rather than the untrue

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.696
white, red, black or yellow
associated with race.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.056
It's a kind of game to question our codes.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.136
It's a work in progress
from a personal story to a global history.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.880
I portray the subjects
in a white background.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.776
Then I choose an 11-pixel
square from the nose,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.440
paint the background,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.320
and look for the corresponding color
in the industrial palette, Pantone.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.456
I started with my family and friends,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.376
then more and more people
joined the adventure,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.160
thanks to public calls
coming through the social media.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.016
I thought that the main space
to show my work was the Internet

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.576
because I want an open concept
that invites everybody

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.880
to push the share button
in both the computer and their brain.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.120
The snowball started to roll.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.000
The project had a great welcome --

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.216
invitations, exhibitions,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.976
physical formats,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
galleries and museums ...

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.536
just happened.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.120
And among them, my favorite:

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.320
when Humanae occupies public spaces

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.480
and appears in the street,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.040
it fosters a popular debate

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.280
and creates a feeling of community.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.896
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.536
in 13 different countries,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.616
19 different cities around the world.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.176
Just to mention some of them --

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.736
from someone included in the Forbes list,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.216
to refugees who crossed
the Mediterranean by boat.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.656
In Paris, from the UNESCO
Headquarters to a shelter.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.600
And students both in Switzerland
and favelas in Rio de Janeiro.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.336
All kinds of beliefs,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.896
gender identities

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.520
or physical impairments,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.136
a newborn or terminally ill.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.000
We all together build Humanae.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.640
Those portraits make us rethink
how we see each other.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.976
When modern science
is questioning the race concept,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.880
what does it mean for us
to be black, white, yellow, red?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.080
Is it the eye, the nose,
the mouth, the hair?

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.056
Or does it have to do with our origin,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.336
nationality

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.720
or bank account?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.240
This personal exercise
turned out to be a discovery.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:57.856
Suddenly I realized that Humanae
was useful for many people.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.136
It represents a sort of mirror

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.720
for those who cannot find
themselves reflected in any label.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.616
It was amazing

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.000
that people started to share
their thoughts about the work with me.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.056
I have hundreds of that,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.880
I will share with you, too.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.880
A mother of 11 years --

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.400
A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.856
"Very good for me as a tool
to work on her confidence,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.936
as this past weekend

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.896
one of her girlfriends argued with her
that she does not belong

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.160
and should not be allowed
to live in Norway.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.936
So your work has
a very special place in my heart

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.760
and it's very important for me."

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.560
A woman shared her portrait
on Facebook and wrote,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.856
"All my life,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.976
people from across the globe
had difficulties to place me in a group,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.456
a stereotype,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.776
a box.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.976
Perhaps we should stop.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.136
Instead of framing, ask the individual,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.456
'How would you label yourself?'

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.296
Then I would say,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.336
'Hi. I'm Massiel.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.896
I'm a Dominican-Dutch,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.936
I grew up in a mixed family

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.840
and I'm a bisexual woman.' "

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.976
Besides these unexpected
and touching reactions,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.656
Humanae finds a new life
in a different variety of fields.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.840
Just to show you some examples,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.895
illustrators and art students

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:38.015
using it as a reference
for their sketches and their studies.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.080
It's a collection of faces.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.776
Researchers in the fields of anthropology,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.096
physics and neuroscience

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.256
use Humanae with different
scientific approaches

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.896
related to human ethnicity,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.656
optophysiology,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.416
face recognition

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.640
or Alzheimer's.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.416
One of the most important
impacts of the project

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.096
is that Humanae was chosen
to be the cover of Foreign Affairs,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.200
one of the most relevant
political publications.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.256
And talking about foreign affairs,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.000
I found the perfect
ambassadors for my project ...

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.896
teachers.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.880
They are the ones that use Humanae
as a tool for educational purposes.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.336
Their passion encourages me
to go back to drawing classes,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.200
but this time as a teacher myself.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.656
My students,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.936
both adults and kids,

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.736
paint their self-portraits,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.240
trying to discover
their own unique color.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.736
As a photographer,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:04.360
I realize that I can be a channel
for others to communicate.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.856
As an individual,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.160
as Angélica,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.256
every time I take a picture,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.480
I feel that I am sitting
in front of a therapist.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.416
All the frustration, fear and loneliness

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.880
that I once felt ...

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.600
becomes love.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.800
The last country --

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.016
the last country in the world
who abolished slavery

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.360
is the country where I was born,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.120
Brazil.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.200
We still have to work hard
to abolish discrimination.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.056
That remains a common practice worldwide,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.680
and that will not disappear by itself.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.736
Thank you.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:11.830
(Applause)

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.080
Thank you.
