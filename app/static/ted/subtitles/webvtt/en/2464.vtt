00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.635
Chris Anderson: This is such
a strange thing.

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.817
Your software, Linux,
is in millions of computers,

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:10.388
it probably powers much of the Internet.

00:00:10.412 --> 00:00:12.175
And I think that there are, like,

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.544
a billion and a half active
Android devices out there.

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:18.169
Your software is in every
single one of them.

00:00:18.808 --> 00:00:19.958
It's kind of amazing.

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:25.017
You must have some amazing
software headquarters driving all this.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:28.347
That's what I thought -- and I was shocked
when I saw a picture of it.

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:29.571
I mean, this is --

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.845
this is the Linux world headquarters.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.859
(Laughter)

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:37.889
(Applause)

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:40.199
Linus Torvalds: It really
doesn't look like much.

00:00:40.223 --> 00:00:41.899
And I have to say,

00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:45.743
the most interesting part in this picture,

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:47.470
that people mostly react to,

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:48.937
is the walking desk.

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:51.660
It is the most interesting
part in my office

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.644
and I'm not actually using it anymore.

00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:55.960
And I think the two things are related.

00:00:57.206 --> 00:00:59.531
The way I work is ...

00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:05.594
I want to not have external stimulation.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.437
You can kind of see,
on the walls are this light green.

00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:15.925
I'm told that at mental institutions
they use that on the walls.

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:16.996
(Laughter)

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.805
It's like a calming color,

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.946
it's not something
that really stimulates you.

00:01:23.064 --> 00:01:27.489
What you can't see is the computer here,
you only see the screen,

00:01:27.513 --> 00:01:30.894
but the main thing I worry
about in my computer is --

00:01:30.918 --> 00:01:34.253
it doesn't have to be big
and powerful, although I like that --

00:01:34.277 --> 00:01:37.109
it really has to be completely silent.

00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:39.986
I know people who work for Google

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.217
and they have their own
small data center at home,

00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:44.393
and I don't do that.

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:48.122
My office is the most
boring office you'll ever see.

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:51.660
And I sit there alone in the quiet.

00:01:52.136 --> 00:01:54.173
If the cat comes up,

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.034
it sits in my lap.

00:01:56.058 --> 00:01:58.248
And I want to hear the cat purring,

00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:01.446
not the sound of the fans in the computer.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.779
CA: So this is astonishing,

00:02:02.803 --> 00:02:05.481
because working this way,

00:02:05.505 --> 00:02:08.493
you're able to run this vast
technology empire --

00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:09.738
it is an empire --

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:13.462
so that's an amazing testament
to the power of open source.

00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:17.662
Tell us how you got
to understand open source

00:02:17.686 --> 00:02:19.938
and how it lead
to the development of Linux.

00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:23.051
LT: I mean, I still work alone.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:26.642
Really -- I work alone in my house,

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.056
often in my bathrobe.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.641
When a photographer shows up, I dress up,

00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:31.951
so I have clothes on.

00:02:31.975 --> 00:02:33.212
(Laughter)

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.308
And that's how I've always worked.

00:02:35.332 --> 00:02:37.340
I mean, this was how I started Linux, too.

00:02:37.364 --> 00:02:41.013
I did not start Linux
as a collaborative project.

00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:45.915
I started it as one
in a series of many projects

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.896
I had done at the time for myself,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.822
partly because I needed the end result,

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:54.148
but even more because I just
enjoyed programming.

00:02:54.172 --> 00:02:58.546
So it was about the end of the journey,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.916
which, 25 years later,
we still have not reached.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.657
But it was really about the fact
that I was looking for a project on my own

00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.510
and there was no open source,
really, on my radar at all.

00:03:09.988 --> 00:03:12.000
And what happened is ...

00:03:12.668 --> 00:03:17.220
the project grows and becomes something
you want to show off to people.

00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:22.669
Really, this is more of a, "Wow,
look at what I did!"

00:03:22.693 --> 00:03:25.248
And trust me -- it was not
that great back then.

00:03:26.128 --> 00:03:28.002
I made it publicly available,

00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:30.132
and it wasn't even
open source at that point.

00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:35.325
At that point it was source that was open,
but there was no intention

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.463
behind using the kind of open-source
methodology that we think of today

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:41.638
to improve it.

00:03:41.662 --> 00:03:42.813
It was more like,

00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:45.774
"Look, I've been working
on this for half a year,

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.198
I'd love to have comments."

00:03:48.717 --> 00:03:50.717
And other people approached me.

00:03:51.217 --> 00:03:52.869
At the University of Helsinki,

00:03:52.893 --> 00:03:56.608
I had a friend who was one
of the open source --

00:03:56.632 --> 00:04:00.288
it was called mainly
"free software" back then --

00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:04.586
and he actually introduced me
to the notion that, hey,

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.967
you can use these open-source
licenses that had been around.

00:04:12.114 --> 00:04:14.155
And I thought about it for a while.

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.670
I was actually worried about the whole
commercial interests coming in.

00:04:17.694 --> 00:04:22.168
I mean, that's one of the worries
I think most people who start out have,

00:04:22.192 --> 00:04:27.152
is that they worry about somebody
taking advantage of their work, right?

00:04:27.603 --> 00:04:30.859
And I decided, "What the hell?"

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.890
And --

00:04:32.914 --> 00:04:34.209
CA: And then at some point,

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:36.693
someone contributed
some code that you thought,

00:04:36.717 --> 00:04:39.888
"Wow, that really is interesting,
I would not have thought of that.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.563
This could actually improve this."

00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:44.112
LT: It didn't even start
by people contributing code,

00:04:44.136 --> 00:04:47.115
it was more that people
started contributing ideas.

00:04:47.748 --> 00:04:50.994
And just the fact that somebody else
takes a look at your project --

00:04:51.018 --> 00:04:53.566
and I'm sure it's true
of other things, too,

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.427
but it's definitely true in code --

00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:58.950
is that somebody else
takes an interest in your code,

00:04:58.974 --> 00:05:01.496
looks at it enough to actually
give you feedback

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.409
and give you ideas.

00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:05.134
That was a huge thing for me.

00:05:05.158 --> 00:05:08.350
I was 21 at the time, so I was young,

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:11.611
but I had already programmed
for half my life, basically.

00:05:12.372 --> 00:05:16.344
And every project before that
had been completely personal

00:05:16.368 --> 00:05:19.475
and it was a revelation when people
just started commenting,

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:22.800
started giving feedback on your code.

00:05:22.824 --> 00:05:26.596
And even before they started
giving code back,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.361
that was, I think, one of the big
moments where I said,

00:05:29.385 --> 00:05:31.258
"I love other people!"

00:05:31.282 --> 00:05:32.439
Don't get me wrong --

00:05:32.463 --> 00:05:34.087
I'm actually not a people person.

00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:37.476
(Laughter)

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.052
I don't really love other people --

00:05:40.076 --> 00:05:41.096
(Laughter)

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.746
But I love computers,

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.985
I love interacting with other
people on email,

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.341
because it kind of gives you that buffer.

00:05:48.365 --> 00:05:54.866
But I do love other people who comment
and get involved in my project.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.543
And it made it so much more.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:06:00.107
CA: So was there a moment
when you saw what was being built

00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:02.338
and it suddenly started taking off,

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.652
and you thought, "Wait a sec,
this actually could be something huge,

00:06:05.676 --> 00:06:08.588
not just a personal project
that I'm getting nice feedback on,

00:06:08.612 --> 00:06:12.932
but a kind of explosive development
in the whole technology world"?

00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:14.980
LT: Not really.

00:06:15.004 --> 00:06:18.576
I mean, the big point for me, really,
was not when it was becoming huge,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.734
it was when it was becoming little.

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:25.226
The big point for me was not being alone

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.967
and having 10, maybe 100
people being involved --

00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:30.470
that was a big point.

00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:33.533
Then everything else was very gradual.

00:06:33.557 --> 00:06:37.816
Going from 100 people to a million people
is not a big deal -- to me.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.673
Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're --

00:06:39.697 --> 00:06:40.698
(Laughter)

00:06:40.722 --> 00:06:43.440
If you want to sell your result
then it's a huge deal --

00:06:43.464 --> 00:06:44.615
don't get me wrong.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.766
But if you're interested in the technology

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.645
and you're interested in the project,

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:50.550
the big part was getting the community.

00:06:50.574 --> 00:06:52.198
Then the community grew gradually.

00:06:52.222 --> 00:06:55.570
And there's actually not
a single point where I went like,

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.342
"Wow, that just took off!" because it --

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:01.690
I mean -- it took a long time, relatively.

00:07:01.714 --> 00:07:04.690
CA: So all the technologists
that I talk to really credit you

00:07:04.714 --> 00:07:07.588
with massively changing their work.

00:07:07.612 --> 00:07:09.235
And it's not just Linux,

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:10.705
it's this thing called Git,

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:14.741
which is this management system
for software development.

00:07:14.765 --> 00:07:17.550
Tell us briefly about that
and your role in that.

00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:20.270
LT: So one of the issues we had,

00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:23.346
and this took a while to start to appear,

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.525
is when you ...

00:07:25.708 --> 00:07:31.040
When you grow from having 10 people
or 100 people working on a project

00:07:31.064 --> 00:07:33.452
to having 10,000 people, which --

00:07:33.476 --> 00:07:36.942
I mean, right now we're in the situation
where just on the kernel,

00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:40.140
we have 1,000 people involved
in every single release

00:07:40.164 --> 00:07:43.750
and that's every two months,
roughly two or three months.

00:07:44.336 --> 00:07:46.757
Some of those people don't do a lot.

00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:49.364
There's a lot of people
who make small, small changes.

00:07:49.388 --> 00:07:51.634
But to maintain this,

00:07:51.658 --> 00:07:54.547
the scale changes how
you have to maintain it.

00:07:54.571 --> 00:07:56.969
And we went through a lot of pain.

00:07:58.713 --> 00:08:05.242
And there are whole projects
that do only source-code maintenance.

00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:08.558
CVS is the one that used to be
the most commonly used,

00:08:08.582 --> 00:08:12.479
and I hated CVS with a passion
and refused to touch it

00:08:12.503 --> 00:08:15.566
and tried something else
that was radical and interesting

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.246
and everybody else hated.

00:08:19.004 --> 00:08:20.378
CA: (Laughs)

00:08:20.402 --> 00:08:22.490
LT: And we were in this bad spot,

00:08:22.514 --> 00:08:25.331
where we had thousands of people
who wanted to participate,

00:08:25.355 --> 00:08:30.396
but in many ways,
I was the kind of break point,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.944
where I could not scale to the point

00:08:32.968 --> 00:08:35.768
where I could work
with thousands of people.

00:08:35.792 --> 00:08:38.244
So Git is my second big project,

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:42.806
which was only created for me
to maintain my first big project.

00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:45.680
And this is literally how I work.

00:08:45.704 --> 00:08:48.209
I don't code for --

00:08:48.233 --> 00:08:49.955
well, I do code for fun --

00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:52.360
but I want to code
for something meaningful

00:08:52.384 --> 00:08:56.431
so every single project I've ever done
has been something I needed

00:08:56.455 --> 00:08:57.831
and --

00:08:57.855 --> 00:09:01.288
CA: So really, both Linux
and Git kind of arose

00:09:01.312 --> 00:09:03.648
almost as an unintended consequence

00:09:03.672 --> 00:09:06.343
of your desire not to have
to work with too many people.

00:09:06.367 --> 00:09:07.518
LT: Absolutely. Yes.

00:09:07.542 --> 00:09:08.622
(Laughter)

00:09:08.646 --> 00:09:10.296
CA: That's amazing.
LT: Yeah.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.812
(Applause)

00:09:11.836 --> 00:09:15.227
And yet, you're the man
who's transformed technology

00:09:15.251 --> 00:09:16.568
not just once but twice,

00:09:16.592 --> 00:09:19.175
and we have to try
and understand why it is.

00:09:19.199 --> 00:09:20.883
You've given us some clues, but ...

00:09:20.907 --> 00:09:25.548
Here's a picture of you as a kid,
with a Rubik's Cube.

00:09:25.572 --> 00:09:29.692
You mentioned that you've been
programming since you were like 10 or 11,

00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:31.081
half your life.

00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:34.921
Were you this sort of computer
genius, you know, übernerd,

00:09:34.945 --> 00:09:37.430
were you the star at school
who could do everything?

00:09:37.454 --> 00:09:38.986
What were you like as a kid?

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.623
LT: Yeah, I think I was
the prototypical nerd.

00:09:42.647 --> 00:09:43.916
I mean, I was ...

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.092
I was not a people person back then.

00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:49.696
That's my younger brother.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.507
I was clearly more interested
in the Rubik's Cube

00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:54.056
than my younger brother.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.167
(Laughter)

00:09:55.191 --> 00:09:58.311
My younger sister,
who's not in the picture,

00:09:58.335 --> 00:10:00.749
when we had family meetings --

00:10:00.773 --> 00:10:04.565
and it's not a huge family, but I have,
like, a couple of cousins --

00:10:04.589 --> 00:10:07.453
she would prep me beforehand.

00:10:07.477 --> 00:10:10.043
Like, before I stepped
into the room she would say,

00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:12.610
"OK. That's so-and-so ..."

00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:16.254
Because I was not --

00:10:16.278 --> 00:10:17.493
I was a geek.

00:10:17.517 --> 00:10:18.683
I was into computers,

00:10:18.707 --> 00:10:19.866
I was into math,

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.041
I was into physics.

00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:22.216
I was good at that.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.026
I don't think I was
particularly exceptional.

00:10:25.554 --> 00:10:27.945
Apparently, my sister said

00:10:27.969 --> 00:10:34.820
that my biggest exceptional quality
was that I would not let go.

00:10:35.618 --> 00:10:38.175
CA: OK, so let's go there,
because that's interesting.

00:10:38.199 --> 00:10:39.373
You would not let go.

00:10:39.397 --> 00:10:42.262
So that's not about being
a geek and being smart,

00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:45.391
that's about being ... stubborn?

00:10:45.415 --> 00:10:46.942
LT: That's about being stubborn.

00:10:46.966 --> 00:10:48.354
That's about, like,

00:10:49.093 --> 00:10:51.293
just starting something

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:56.767
and not saying, "OK, I'm done,
let's do something else --

00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:57.978
Look: shiny!"

00:10:58.954 --> 00:11:02.335
And I notice that in many
other parts in my life, too.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.720
I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.

00:11:06.744 --> 00:11:10.856
And I worked for the same
company, in Silicon Valley,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.594
for the whole time.

00:11:12.618 --> 00:11:14.156
That is unheard of.

00:11:15.204 --> 00:11:16.971
That's not how Silicon Valley works.

00:11:16.995 --> 00:11:20.574
The whole point of Silicon Valley
is that people jump between jobs

00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:23.225
to kind of mix up the pot.

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:25.129
And that's not the kind of person I am.

00:11:25.153 --> 00:11:27.724
CA: But during the actual
development of Linux itself,

00:11:27.748 --> 00:11:32.044
that stubbornness sometimes brought
you in conflict with other people.

00:11:32.445 --> 00:11:34.099
Talk about that a bit.

00:11:34.123 --> 00:11:39.667
Was that essential to sort of maintain
the quality of what was being built?

00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:41.856
How would you describe what happened?

00:11:42.392 --> 00:11:44.475
LT: I don't know if it's essential.

00:11:45.239 --> 00:11:48.384
Going back to the "I'm not
a people person," --

00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:50.196
sometimes I'm also ...

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.633
shall we say,

00:11:53.657 --> 00:11:57.077
"myopic" when it comes
to other people's feelings,

00:11:57.667 --> 00:12:02.945
and that sometimes makes you
say things that hurt other people.

00:12:02.969 --> 00:12:06.737
And I'm not proud of that.

00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:07.875
(Applause)

00:12:07.899 --> 00:12:09.697
But, at the same time, it's --

00:12:10.978 --> 00:12:14.054
I get people who tell me
that I should be nice.

00:12:14.796 --> 00:12:20.464
And then when I try to explain to them
that maybe you're nice,

00:12:20.488 --> 00:12:22.742
maybe you should be more aggressive,

00:12:22.766 --> 00:12:26.308
they see that as me being not nice.

00:12:26.332 --> 00:12:28.442
(Laughter)

00:12:28.466 --> 00:12:30.634
What I'm trying to say
is we are different.

00:12:30.658 --> 00:12:32.468
I'm not a people person;

00:12:32.492 --> 00:12:34.598
it's not something
I'm particularly proud of,

00:12:34.622 --> 00:12:36.162
but it's part of me.

00:12:36.186 --> 00:12:38.891
And one of the things
I really like about open source

00:12:38.915 --> 00:12:44.707
is it really allows different
people to work together.

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:46.455
We don't have to like each other --

00:12:46.479 --> 00:12:48.682
and sometimes we really
don't like each other.

00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:52.193
Really -- I mean, there are very,
very heated arguments.

00:12:52.217 --> 00:12:55.209
But you can, actually,
you can find things that --

00:12:56.327 --> 00:12:58.554
you don't even agree to disagree,

00:12:58.578 --> 00:13:01.624
it's just that you're interested
in really different things.

00:13:01.648 --> 00:13:04.551
And coming back to the point
where I said earlier

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:08.868
that I was afraid of commercial people
taking advantage of your work,

00:13:08.892 --> 00:13:11.491
it turned out, and very
quickly turned out,

00:13:11.515 --> 00:13:14.481
that those commercial people
were lovely, lovely people.

00:13:14.505 --> 00:13:18.211
And they did all the things that I was not
at all interested in doing,

00:13:18.235 --> 00:13:20.292
and they had completely different goals.

00:13:20.316 --> 00:13:25.639
And they used open source in ways
that I just did not want to go.

00:13:25.663 --> 00:13:27.925
But because it was open
source they could do it,

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:30.301
and it actually works
really beautifully together.

00:13:30.325 --> 00:13:32.349
And I actually think
it works the same way.

00:13:32.373 --> 00:13:35.578
You need to have the people-people,
the communicators,

00:13:35.602 --> 00:13:37.029
the warm and friendly people

00:13:37.053 --> 00:13:38.775
who like --

00:13:38.799 --> 00:13:40.241
(Laughter)

00:13:40.265 --> 00:13:43.315
really want to hug you
and get you into the community.

00:13:43.339 --> 00:13:44.910
But that's not everybody.

00:13:44.934 --> 00:13:46.366
And that's not me.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.847
I care about the technology.

00:13:47.871 --> 00:13:49.752
There are people who care about the UI.

00:13:49.776 --> 00:13:52.846
I can't do UI to save my life.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.891
I mean, if I was stranded on an island

00:13:55.915 --> 00:13:59.315
and the only way to get off that island
was the make a pretty UI,

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:00.502
I'd die there.

00:14:00.526 --> 00:14:01.677
(Laughter)

00:14:01.701 --> 00:14:03.840
So there's different kinds of people,

00:14:03.864 --> 00:14:06.729
and I'm not making excuses,
I'm trying to explain.

00:14:06.753 --> 00:14:08.419
CA: Now, when we talked last week,

00:14:08.443 --> 00:14:10.928
you talked about some
other trait that you have,

00:14:10.952 --> 00:14:12.543
which I found really interesting.

00:14:12.567 --> 00:14:13.950
It's this idea called taste.

00:14:13.974 --> 00:14:15.976
And I've just got a couple of images here.

00:14:16.354 --> 00:14:20.357
I think this is an example of not
particularly good taste in code,

00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:23.372
and this one is better taste,

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:25.459
which one can immediately see.

00:14:25.483 --> 00:14:27.456
What is the difference between these two?

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:29.821
LT: So this is --

00:14:29.845 --> 00:14:32.522
How many people here actually have coded?

00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:35.191
CA: Oh my goodness.

00:14:35.215 --> 00:14:36.370
LT: So I guarantee you,

00:14:36.394 --> 00:14:37.939
everybody who raised their hand,

00:14:37.963 --> 00:14:40.584
they have done what's called
a singly-linked list.

00:14:40.608 --> 00:14:42.617
And it's taught --

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:46.706
This, the first not very
good taste approach,

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:50.797
is basically how it's taught to be done
when you start out coding.

00:14:50.821 --> 00:14:52.865
And you don't have to understand the code.

00:14:52.889 --> 00:14:54.945
The most interesting part to me

00:14:54.969 --> 00:14:57.158
is the last if statement.

00:14:58.933 --> 00:15:01.193
Because what happens
in a singly-linked list --

00:15:01.217 --> 00:15:04.867
this is trying to remove
an existing entry from a list --

00:15:04.891 --> 00:15:08.733
and there's a difference
between if it's the first entry

00:15:08.757 --> 00:15:10.756
or whether it's an entry in the middle.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.385
Because if it's the first entry,

00:15:12.409 --> 00:15:15.425
you have to change
the pointer to the first entry.

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:16.647
If it's in the middle,

00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:19.092
you have to change the pointer
of a previous entry.

00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:21.140
So they're two completely different cases.

00:15:21.164 --> 00:15:22.316
CA: And that's better.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.521
LT: And this is better.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.263
It does not have the if statement.

00:15:26.637 --> 00:15:28.850
And it doesn't really matter --

00:15:28.874 --> 00:15:32.075
I don't want you understand
why it doesn't have the if statement,

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:33.441
but I want you to understand

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:36.090
that sometimes you can see
a problem in a different way

00:15:36.114 --> 00:15:39.468
and rewrite it so that
a special case goes away

00:15:39.492 --> 00:15:41.369
and becomes the normal case.

00:15:41.393 --> 00:15:42.932
And that's good code.

00:15:43.328 --> 00:15:44.878
But this is simple code.

00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:46.251
This is CS 101.

00:15:46.275 --> 00:15:49.131
This is not important --
although, details are important.

00:15:49.798 --> 00:15:53.876
To me, the sign of people
I really want to work with

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.573
is that they have good taste,
which is how ...

00:15:57.295 --> 00:15:58.892
I sent you this stupid example

00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:01.260
that is not relevant
because it's too small.

00:16:01.743 --> 00:16:03.885
Good taste is much bigger than this.

00:16:03.909 --> 00:16:07.930
Good taste is about really
seeing the big patterns

00:16:07.954 --> 00:16:12.412
and kind of instinctively knowing
what's the right way to do things.

00:16:12.436 --> 00:16:15.093
CA: OK, so we're putting
the pieces together here now.

00:16:15.736 --> 00:16:17.203
You have taste,

00:16:18.057 --> 00:16:20.394
in a way that's meaningful
to software people.

00:16:20.418 --> 00:16:21.569
You're --

00:16:21.593 --> 00:16:23.409
(Laughter)

00:16:23.433 --> 00:16:25.994
LT: I think it was meaningful
to some people here.

00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:30.884
CA: You're a very smart computer coder,

00:16:30.908 --> 00:16:32.605
and you're hellish stubborn.

00:16:33.622 --> 00:16:35.208
But there must be something else.

00:16:35.232 --> 00:16:36.855
I mean, you've changed the future.

00:16:36.879 --> 00:16:39.842
You must have the ability
of these grand visions of the future.

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:41.127
You're a visionary, right?

00:16:41.151 --> 00:16:43.742
LT: I've actually felt slightly
uncomfortable at TED

00:16:43.766 --> 00:16:45.926
for the last two days,

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.545
because there's a lot
of vision going on, right?

00:16:48.569 --> 00:16:50.266
And I am not a visionary.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.519
I do not have a five-year plan.

00:16:52.543 --> 00:16:53.901
I'm an engineer.

00:16:53.925 --> 00:16:55.185
And I think it's really --

00:16:55.209 --> 00:16:57.528
I mean -- I'm perfectly
happy with all the people

00:16:57.552 --> 00:17:00.303
who are walking around
and just staring at the clouds

00:17:00.327 --> 00:17:03.178
and looking at the stars
and saying, "I want to go there."

00:17:03.202 --> 00:17:04.654
But I'm looking at the ground,

00:17:04.678 --> 00:17:07.533
and I want to fix the pothole
that's right in front of me

00:17:07.557 --> 00:17:08.917
before I fall in.

00:17:08.941 --> 00:17:10.560
This is the kind of person I am.

00:17:10.584 --> 00:17:11.695
(Cheers)

00:17:11.719 --> 00:17:13.031
(Applause)

00:17:13.055 --> 00:17:16.666
CA: So you spoke to me last week
about these two guys.

00:17:17.358 --> 00:17:19.793
Who are they and how
do you relate to them?

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:23.841
LT: Well, so this is kind
of cliché in technology,

00:17:23.865 --> 00:17:25.872
the whole Tesla versus Edison,

00:17:25.896 --> 00:17:30.837
where Tesla is seen as the visionary
scientist and crazy idea man.

00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:33.643
And people love Tesla.

00:17:33.667 --> 00:17:36.654
I mean, there are people who name
their companies after him.

00:17:36.678 --> 00:17:37.828
(Laughter)

00:17:39.365 --> 00:17:41.977
The other person there is Edison,

00:17:42.001 --> 00:17:45.508
who is actually often vilified
for being kind of pedestrian

00:17:45.532 --> 00:17:47.453
and is --

00:17:47.477 --> 00:17:50.199
I mean, his most famous quote is,

00:17:50.223 --> 00:17:54.937
"Genius is one percent inspiration
and 99 percent perspiration."

00:17:55.394 --> 00:17:56.847
And I'm in the Edison camp,

00:17:56.871 --> 00:17:59.055
even if people don't always like him.

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:02.098
Because if you actually compare the two,

00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:06.655
Tesla has kind of this mind
grab these days,

00:18:06.679 --> 00:18:08.678
but who actually changed the world?

00:18:09.853 --> 00:18:13.235
Edison may not have been a nice person,

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.391
he did a lot of things --

00:18:16.415 --> 00:18:18.844
he was maybe not so intellectual,

00:18:18.868 --> 00:18:21.095
not so visionary.

00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:24.780
But I think I'm more
of an Edison than a Tesla.

00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:28.107
CA: So our theme at TED
this week is dreams --

00:18:28.131 --> 00:18:29.478
big, bold, audacious dreams.

00:18:29.502 --> 00:18:31.304
You're really the antidote to that.

00:18:31.328 --> 00:18:33.437
LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.

00:18:33.461 --> 00:18:34.612
CA: That's good.

00:18:34.636 --> 00:18:35.716
(Laughter)

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.345
We embrace you, we embrace you.

00:18:39.046 --> 00:18:41.795
Companies like Google and many
others have made, arguably,

00:18:41.819 --> 00:18:44.025
like, billions of dollars
out of your software.

00:18:44.049 --> 00:18:45.200
Does that piss you off?

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:46.375
LT: No.

00:18:46.399 --> 00:18:49.033
No, it doesn't piss me off
for several reasons.

00:18:49.057 --> 00:18:51.067
And one of them is, I'm doing fine.

00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:52.387
I'm really doing fine.

00:18:52.942 --> 00:18:54.526
But the other reason is --

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:59.877
I mean, without doing the whole
open source and really letting go thing,

00:18:59.901 --> 00:19:02.127
Linux would never have been what it is.

00:19:02.151 --> 00:19:07.247
And it's brought experiences
I don't really enjoy, public talking,

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:09.422
but at the same time,
this is an experience.

00:19:09.446 --> 00:19:10.726
Trust me.

00:19:11.238 --> 00:19:16.381
So there's a lot of things going on
that make me a very happy man

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.934
and thinking I did the right choices.

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.870
CA: Is the open source idea --

00:19:20.894 --> 00:19:22.530
this is, I think we'll end here --

00:19:22.554 --> 00:19:26.608
is the open source idea
fully realized now in the world,

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:29.650
or is there more that it could go,

00:19:29.674 --> 00:19:31.689
are there more things that it could do?

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:34.972
LT: So, I'm of two minds there.

00:19:34.996 --> 00:19:39.482
I think one reason open source
works so well in code

00:19:39.506 --> 00:19:41.915
is that at the end of the day,

00:19:41.939 --> 00:19:45.185
code tends to be somewhat black and white.

00:19:45.209 --> 00:19:49.366
There's often a fairly good way to decide,

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:53.336
this is done correctly
and this is not done well.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.738
Code either works or it doesn't,

00:19:55.762 --> 00:20:00.370
which means that there's less
room for arguments.

00:20:00.394 --> 00:20:04.025
And we have arguments despite this, right?

00:20:04.049 --> 00:20:05.964
In many other areas --

00:20:05.988 --> 00:20:09.729
I mean, people have talked about
open politics and things like that --

00:20:09.753 --> 00:20:12.702
and it's really hard sometimes to say

00:20:12.726 --> 00:20:16.483
that, yes, you can apply the same
principles in some other areas

00:20:16.507 --> 00:20:21.946
just because the black and white
turns into not just gray,

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.573
but different colors.

00:20:24.339 --> 00:20:28.705
So, obviously open source in science
is making a comeback.

00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:30.363
Science was there first.

00:20:30.387 --> 00:20:33.054
But then science ended up
being pretty closed,

00:20:33.078 --> 00:20:36.702
with very expensive journals
and some of that going on.

00:20:36.726 --> 00:20:40.562
And open source is making
a comeback in science,

00:20:40.586 --> 00:20:44.733
with things like arXiv and open journals.

00:20:47.262 --> 00:20:49.215
Wikipedia changed the world, too.

00:20:49.239 --> 00:20:50.693
So there are other examples,

00:20:50.717 --> 00:20:52.350
I'm sure there are more to come.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.227
CA: But you're not a visionary,

00:20:55.251 --> 00:20:57.204
and so it's not up to you to name them.

00:20:57.228 --> 00:20:58.387
LT: No.

00:20:58.411 --> 00:20:59.459
(Laughter)

00:20:59.483 --> 00:21:01.447
It's up to you guys to make them, right?

00:21:01.471 --> 00:21:02.734
CA: Exactly.

00:21:02.758 --> 00:21:03.916
Linus Torvalds,

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.185
thank you for Linux,
thank you for the Internet,

00:21:06.209 --> 00:21:08.074
thank you for all those Android phones.

00:21:08.098 --> 00:21:11.295
Thank you for coming here to TED
and revealing so much of yourself.

00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:12.471
LT: Thank you.

00:21:12.495 --> 00:21:16.935
(Applause)
