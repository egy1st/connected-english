WEBVTT

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.635
I'm here to talk to you today

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.771
about a story that we have all
been conditioned to believe

00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:07.335
is not possible.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.657
It's a story about a living,
breathing start-up

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.076
flourishing in an unlikely environment:

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.926
the United States government.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.584
Now, this start-up is fundamentally
beginning to disrupt

00:00:16.608 --> 00:00:19.096
the way government does
business from the inside out.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.620
But before I get there,
let's start with the problem.

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:25.343
For me, the problem begins
with a number: 137.

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:29.417
137 is the average number of days

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:32.852
a veteran has to wait to have benefits
processed by the VA.

00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:35.008
137 days.

00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:37.787
Now, in order to file that application
in the first place,

00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:41.399
she has to navigate
over 1,000 different websites

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:44.216
and over 900 different call-in numbers,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.441
all owned and operated
by the United States government.

00:00:48.073 --> 00:00:50.925
Now, we live in times
of incredible change.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.716
The private sector is constantly changing

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.505
and improving itself all the time.

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:58.967
For that matter, it's removing
every single inconvenience in my life

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.784
that I could possibly think of.

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:03.363
I could be sitting on my couch
in my apartment,

00:01:03.387 --> 00:01:06.429
and from my phone, I can order
a warm, gluten-free meal

00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:09.432
that can arrive at my door
in less than 10 minutes.

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:13.679
But meanwhile, a working mother
who depends on food stamps

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:15.764
to support her family

00:01:15.788 --> 00:01:18.927
has to complete an arduous,
complicated application

00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:21.412
which she might not even
be able to do online.

00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:25.578
And the inability of her to do that same
work from her couch means

00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:28.682
that she might be having to take
days or hours off of work

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:30.094
that she can't spare.

00:01:31.173 --> 00:01:33.689
And this growing dichotomy

00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:36.007
between the beneficiaries
of the tech revolution

00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:37.426
and those it's left behind

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.972
is one of the greatest
challenges of our time --

00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:44.385
(Applause)

00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:49.862
Because government's failure
to deliver digital services that work

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:54.440
is disproportionately impacting
the very people who need it most.

00:01:54.464 --> 00:01:57.083
It's impacting the students
trying to go to college,

00:01:57.107 --> 00:01:59.161
the single mothers
trying to get health care,

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.962
the veterans coming home from battle.

00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:04.058
They can't get what they need
when they need it.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:05.468
And for these Americans,

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:09.147
government is more than just
a presidential election every four years.

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.237
Government is a lifeline
that provides services they need

00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:14.586
and depend on and deserve.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.777
Which is, quite frankly,

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:18.984
why government needs to get
its shit together and catch up.

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:20.167
Just saying.

00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:23.501
(Applause)

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.871
Now, this wasn't always a problem
I was passionate about.

00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:29.655
When I joined President Obama's
campaign in 2008,

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.836
we brought the tech industry's
best practices into politics.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.591
We earned more money,

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:36.336
we engaged more volunteers

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.034
and we earned more votes
than any political campaign in history.

00:02:40.058 --> 00:02:43.840
We were a cutting-edge start-up
that changed the game of politics forever.

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:46.123
So when the President asked
a small group of us

00:02:46.147 --> 00:02:48.998
to bring that very same disruption
directly into government,

00:02:49.022 --> 00:02:50.889
I knew it wasn't going to be easy work,

00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:53.671
but I was eager and showed up
ready to get to work.

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:57.441
Now, on my first day in DC,

00:02:57.465 --> 00:02:59.975
my first day in government,

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.940
I walked into the office
and they handed me a laptop.

00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:05.424
And the laptop was running Windows 98.

00:03:05.448 --> 00:03:06.822
(Laughter)

00:03:06.846 --> 00:03:10.538
I mean, three entire presidential
elections had come and gone

00:03:10.562 --> 00:03:13.919
since the government had updated
the operating system on that computer.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.354
Three elections!

00:03:16.093 --> 00:03:17.638
Which is when we realized

00:03:17.662 --> 00:03:21.726
this problem was a whole lot bigger
than we ever could have imagined.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.506
Let me paint the picture for you.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.073
The federal government is the largest
institution in the world.

00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:32.669
It spends over 86 billion dollars
a year -- 86 billion --

00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:34.346
on federal IT projects.

00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:35.914
For context:

00:03:35.938 --> 00:03:38.859
that is more than the entire
venture capital industry spends

00:03:38.883 --> 00:03:40.679
annually -- on everything.

00:03:41.547 --> 00:03:43.389
Now, the problem here

00:03:43.413 --> 00:03:47.524
is that we the taxpayers
are not getting what we pay for,

00:03:47.548 --> 00:03:51.365
because 94 percent of federal IT projects

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.604
are over budget or behind schedule.

00:03:53.628 --> 00:03:55.064
94 percent!

00:03:55.088 --> 00:03:56.577
For those of you keeping score,

00:03:56.601 --> 00:03:58.910
yes, the number 94 is very close to 100.

00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:00.402
(Laughter)

00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:02.600
There's another problem:

00:04:02.624 --> 00:04:06.388
40 percent of those never end up
seeing the light of day.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.990
They are completely scrapped or abandoned.

00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:13.772
Now, this is a very existentially
painful moment for any organization,

00:04:13.796 --> 00:04:16.193
because it means as government
continues to operate

00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:17.432
as it's programmed to do,

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:19.071
failure is nearly inevitable.

00:04:19.482 --> 00:04:22.946
And when the status quo
is the riskiest option,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.018
that means there is simply no other choice

00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:26.784
than radical disruption.

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.257
So, what do we do about it?

00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:32.416
How do we fix this?

00:04:33.065 --> 00:04:35.682
Well, the irony of all of this

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:38.979
is that we actually don't have to look
any further than our backyard,

00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:42.868
because right here in America
are the very ideas, the very people,

00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:45.562
who have swept our world
into a radically different place

00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:47.252
than it was two decades ago.

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:49.557
So what would it look like

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.921
if it was actually as easy to get
student loans or veterans' benefits

00:04:52.945 --> 00:04:55.787
as it is to order cat food to my house?

00:04:56.358 --> 00:04:58.124
What would it look like

00:04:58.628 --> 00:05:02.561
if there was an easy pathway
for the very entrepreneurs and innovators

00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:04.348
who have disrupted our tech sector

00:05:04.372 --> 00:05:06.387
to come and disrupt their government?

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:09.119
Well, my friends,
here's where we get to talk

00:05:09.143 --> 00:05:11.790
about some of the exciting
new formulas we've discovered

00:05:11.814 --> 00:05:13.487
for creating change in government.

00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:15.742
Enter the United States Digital Service.

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:19.799
The United States Digital Service
is a new network of start-ups,

00:05:19.823 --> 00:05:21.378
a team of teams,

00:05:21.402 --> 00:05:25.282
organizing themselves across government
to create radical change.

00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:29.675
The mission of the United States
Digital Service is to help government

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.787
deliver world-class digital services

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:36.340
for students, immigrants,
children, the elderly -- everybody --

00:05:36.364 --> 00:05:38.759
at dramatically lower costs.

00:05:39.664 --> 00:05:43.139
We are essentially trying to build
a more awesome government,

00:05:43.163 --> 00:05:45.264
for the people, by the people, today.

00:05:45.288 --> 00:05:47.138
We don't care -- (Applause) Thank you.

00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:49.354
(Applause)

00:05:49.378 --> 00:05:51.869
Who doesn't want a more
awesome government, right?

00:05:52.632 --> 00:05:55.130
We don't care about politics.

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:57.344
We care about making
government work better,

00:05:57.368 --> 00:05:59.430
because it's the only one we've got.

00:05:59.454 --> 00:06:01.224
(Applause)

00:06:01.883 --> 00:06:05.106
Now, you can think of our team --
well, it's pretty funny --

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.182
you can think
of our team a little bit like

00:06:07.206 --> 00:06:09.816
the Peace Corps meets DARPA
meets SEAL Team 6.

00:06:10.316 --> 00:06:12.079
We're like the Peace Corps for nerds,

00:06:12.103 --> 00:06:15.076
but instead of traveling to crazy,
interesting, far-off places,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.489
you spend a lot of time indoors,
behind computers,

00:06:17.513 --> 00:06:19.758
helping restore the fabric
of our democracy.

00:06:19.782 --> 00:06:21.501
(Laughter)

00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:26.173
Now, this team -- our playbook
for the United States Digital Service

00:06:26.197 --> 00:06:27.537
is pretty simple.

00:06:28.053 --> 00:06:31.657
The first play is we recruit
the very best talent

00:06:31.681 --> 00:06:33.394
our country has to offer,

00:06:33.418 --> 00:06:36.423
and recruit them for short tours
of duty inside government.

00:06:36.447 --> 00:06:39.949
These are the very people who have helped
build the products and companies

00:06:39.973 --> 00:06:43.356
that have made our tech sector amongst
the most innovative in the world.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.549
Second, we pair these incredible
people from the tech core

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:49.439
with the dedicated civil servants
already inside government

00:06:49.463 --> 00:06:51.581
on the ground creating change.

00:06:51.605 --> 00:06:55.491
Third, we strategically deploy them
in a targeted formation

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:58.675
at the most mission-critical,
life-changing, important services

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:00.206
that government offers.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.873
And finally, we give them
massive air cover,

00:07:02.897 --> 00:07:04.772
from the leadership inside the agencies

00:07:04.796 --> 00:07:07.162
all the way up to the President himself,

00:07:07.186 --> 00:07:09.707
to transform these services
for the better.

00:07:10.437 --> 00:07:13.252
Now, this team is beginning to disrupt

00:07:13.276 --> 00:07:15.949
how government does business
from the inside out.

00:07:16.538 --> 00:07:19.545
If you study classic
patterns of disruption,

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:22.228
one very common pattern is rather simple.

00:07:22.252 --> 00:07:25.855
It's to take something that has become
routine and standard in one industry

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:28.419
and apply it to another
where it's a radical departure

00:07:28.443 --> 00:07:29.712
from the status quo.

00:07:29.736 --> 00:07:33.052
Think about what Airbnb took
that was normal from hospitality

00:07:33.076 --> 00:07:35.264
and revolutionized my apartment.

00:07:36.058 --> 00:07:38.924
The United States Digital Service
is doing exactly that.

00:07:38.948 --> 00:07:42.242
We are taking what Silicon Valley
and the private sector has learned

00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:43.568
through a ton of hard work

00:07:43.592 --> 00:07:46.203
about how to build
planetary-scale digital services

00:07:46.227 --> 00:07:48.091
that delight users at lower cost,

00:07:48.115 --> 00:07:49.955
and we're applying that to government,

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:52.875
where it is a radical departure
from the status quo.

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:54.923
Now, the good news is:

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:56.879
it's starting to work.

00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:00.198
We know this because we can
already see the results

00:08:00.222 --> 00:08:03.859
from some of our early projects,
like the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov,

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.473
when that went off the rails.

00:08:05.497 --> 00:08:09.201
Fixing Healthcare.gov was the first place
that we ran this play,

00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:11.082
and today we are taking that same play

00:08:11.106 --> 00:08:12.852
and scaling it across a large number

00:08:12.876 --> 00:08:16.284
of government's most important
citizen-facing services.

00:08:17.077 --> 00:08:19.324
Now, if I can take a moment

00:08:19.348 --> 00:08:21.451
and brag about the team for a second --

00:08:21.475 --> 00:08:24.062
it is the highest
concentration of badasses

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:26.290
I could have ever dreamed of.

00:08:26.314 --> 00:08:30.142
We have top talent from Google,
Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes,

00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:32.327
all on staff today,

00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:35.675
all choosing to join their government.

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:36.939
And what's incredible is,

00:08:36.963 --> 00:08:40.898
everybody is as eager and kind
as they are intelligent.

00:08:40.922 --> 00:08:44.382
And I might add, by the way,
over half of us are women.

00:08:44.406 --> 00:08:48.511
(Applause)

00:08:51.244 --> 00:08:53.583
The best way to understand this strategy

00:08:53.607 --> 00:08:55.867
is actually to walk through
a couple of examples

00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:57.621
of how it's working out in the wild.

00:08:57.645 --> 00:08:59.657
I'm going to give you
two examples quickly.

00:08:59.681 --> 00:09:01.497
The first one is about immigration.

00:09:01.986 --> 00:09:05.601
This, my friends, is your typical
immigration application.

00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:06.788
Yes, you guessed it --

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:09.286
it's almost entirely paper-based.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.461
In the best case,

00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:13.293
the application takes about six
to eight months to process.

00:09:13.317 --> 00:09:17.150
It is physically shipped thousands
of miles -- thousands of miles! --

00:09:17.174 --> 00:09:19.614
between no less than six
processing centers.

00:09:20.188 --> 00:09:21.558
Now, little story:

00:09:22.168 --> 00:09:23.319
about a decade ago,

00:09:23.343 --> 00:09:26.220
the government thought
that if it brought this system online,

00:09:26.244 --> 00:09:29.118
it could save taxpayer dollars
and provide a better service,

00:09:29.142 --> 00:09:30.293
which was a great idea.

00:09:30.317 --> 00:09:33.058
So, the typical government process began.

00:09:33.922 --> 00:09:38.263
Six years and 1.2 billion dollars later,

00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:40.568
no working product was delivered --

00:09:40.592 --> 00:09:42.678
1.2 billion with a "B."

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.022
Now at this point, the agency responsible,

00:09:46.046 --> 00:09:47.969
US Citizenship and Immigration Services,

00:09:47.993 --> 00:09:50.757
could have kept pouring money
into the failing program.

00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:52.424
Sadly, that's what often happens.

00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:54.051
That's the status quo today.

00:09:54.075 --> 00:09:55.236
But they didn't.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.478
The dedicated civil servants
inside the agency

00:09:57.502 --> 00:09:59.801
decided to stand up and call for change.

00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:02.473
We deployed a small team
of just six people,

00:10:02.497 --> 00:10:04.179
and what many people don't know is

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:07.134
that's the same size as the rescue
effort of Healthcare.gov --

00:10:07.158 --> 00:10:08.379
just six people.

00:10:08.403 --> 00:10:10.234
And that team jumped in, side-by-side,

00:10:10.258 --> 00:10:12.972
to support the agency
in transitioning this project

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:16.749
into more modern business practices,
more modern development practices.

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:18.381
Now, in non-tech speak,

00:10:18.405 --> 00:10:22.387
what that basically means
is taking big, multi-year projects

00:10:22.411 --> 00:10:24.726
and breaking them up
into bite-sized chunks,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.386
so that way we can reduce the risk

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.047
and actually start to see results
every couple of weeks,

00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:31.232
instead of waiting
in a black box for years.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:34.462
So within less than three months
of our team being on the ground,

00:10:34.486 --> 00:10:37.731
we were already able to push
our first products to production.

00:10:38.152 --> 00:10:40.764
The first one, this is the form I-90.

00:10:40.788 --> 00:10:44.184
This is used to file
for your replacement green card.

00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:45.773
Now, for immigrant visa holders,

00:10:45.797 --> 00:10:48.685
a replacement green card is a big deal.

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:50.967
Your green card is your proof
of identification,

00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:52.380
it's your work authorization,

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:54.853
it's the proof that you can
be here in this country.

00:10:54.877 --> 00:10:58.098
So waiting six months while the government
processes the replacement

00:10:58.122 --> 00:10:59.322
is not cool.

00:10:59.346 --> 00:11:01.037
I'm excited to tell you that today,

00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:04.218
you can now, for the first time,
file for a replacement green card

00:11:04.242 --> 00:11:07.445
entirely online without anyone
touching a piece of paper.

00:11:07.469 --> 00:11:09.487
It is faster, it is cheaper,

00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:11.908
and it's a better user experience
for the applicant

00:11:11.932 --> 00:11:13.820
and the government employees alike.

00:11:13.844 --> 00:11:17.361
(Applause)

00:11:20.677 --> 00:11:21.828
Another one, quickly.

00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:25.099
Last fall, we just released
a brand-new practice civics test.

00:11:25.123 --> 00:11:27.363
So as part of becoming a US citizen,

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:29.737
you have to pass a civics test.

00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:34.099
For anyone who has taken this test,
it can be quite the stressful process.

00:11:34.123 --> 00:11:38.710
So our team released a very easy,
simple-to-use tool in plain language

00:11:38.734 --> 00:11:40.890
to help people prepare,

00:11:40.914 --> 00:11:42.588
to help ease their nerves,

00:11:42.612 --> 00:11:44.342
to help them feel more confident

00:11:44.366 --> 00:11:47.797
in taking the next step
in pursuing their American dream.

00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:50.732
Because all of this work,
all of this work on immigration,

00:11:50.756 --> 00:11:54.591
is about taking complicated processes
and making them more human.

00:11:55.527 --> 00:11:58.557
The other day, one of the dedicated
civil servants on the ground

00:11:58.581 --> 00:12:01.459
said something incredibly profound.

00:12:01.483 --> 00:12:04.706
She said that she's never been
this hopeful or optimistic

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.443
about a project in her entire
time in government.

00:12:08.101 --> 00:12:10.468
And she's been doing this for 30 years.

00:12:11.285 --> 00:12:13.706
That is exactly the kind of hope
and culture change

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:14.998
we are trying to create.

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:18.919
For my second example, I want to bring
it back to veterans for a second,

00:12:18.943 --> 00:12:20.893
and what we are doing to build them a VA

00:12:20.917 --> 00:12:23.732
that is worthy of their service
and their sacrifice.

00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:26.297
I'm proud to say
that just a few months ago,

00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:28.217
we released a brand-new beta

00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:30.309
of a new website, Vets.gov.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.905
Vets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website

00:12:32.929 --> 00:12:36.665
that brings all of the online services
a veteran needs into one place.

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:39.404
One website, not thousands.

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:43.165
The site is a work in progress,
but it's significant progress,

00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:45.776
because it's designed
with the users who matter most:

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.705
the veterans themselves.

00:12:47.729 --> 00:12:50.522
This might sound incredibly obvious,
because it should be,

00:12:50.546 --> 00:12:52.768
but sadly, this isn't
normal for government.

00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:56.236
Far too often, product decisions
are made by committees of stakeholders

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.942
who do their best to represent
the interests of the user,

00:12:58.966 --> 00:13:01.270
but they're not necessarily
the users themselves.

00:13:01.294 --> 00:13:03.835
So our team at the VA went out,
we looked at the data,

00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:05.523
we talked to veterans themselves

00:13:05.547 --> 00:13:07.135
and we started simple and small,

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:10.543
with the two most important services
that matter most to them:

00:13:10.567 --> 00:13:13.346
education benefits
and disability benefits.

00:13:13.873 --> 00:13:16.517
I'm proud to say that they are
live on the site today,

00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:19.079
and as the team continues
to streamline more services,

00:13:19.103 --> 00:13:21.954
they will be ported over here,
and the old sites, shut down.

00:13:21.978 --> 00:13:26.344
(Applause)

00:13:27.596 --> 00:13:31.668
To me, this is what change
looks like in 2016.

00:13:32.493 --> 00:13:34.267
When you walk out of the Oval Office,

00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:36.632
the first time I was ever
there, I noticed a quote

00:13:36.656 --> 00:13:38.623
the President had embroidered on the rug.

00:13:38.647 --> 00:13:40.552
It's the classic JFK quote.

00:13:40.576 --> 00:13:44.943
It says, "No problem of human destiny
is beyond human beings."

00:13:45.882 --> 00:13:47.232
It's true.

00:13:47.256 --> 00:13:50.399
We have the tools to solve these problems.

00:13:50.423 --> 00:13:53.708
We have the tools to come together
as a society, as a country,

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:55.693
and to fix this together.

00:13:56.073 --> 00:13:57.690
Yes, it's hard.

00:13:58.034 --> 00:14:00.137
It's particularly hard
when we have to fight,

00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:04.215
when we have to refuse to succumb
to the belief that things won't change.

00:14:04.626 --> 00:14:06.356
But in my experience,

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.840
it's often the hardest things
that are the most worth doing,

00:14:09.864 --> 00:14:11.669
because if we don't do them,

00:14:11.693 --> 00:14:13.106
who will?

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.138
This is on us,

00:14:15.162 --> 00:14:17.058
all of us, together,

00:14:17.082 --> 00:14:20.273
because government is not
an abstract institution or a concept.

00:14:20.686 --> 00:14:23.265
Our government is us.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:28.039
(Applause)

00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:30.590
Today, it is no longer a question

00:14:30.614 --> 00:14:32.518
of if change is possible.

00:14:33.422 --> 00:14:35.359
The question is not, "Can we?"

00:14:36.367 --> 00:14:37.986
The question is, "Will we?"

00:14:38.912 --> 00:14:40.292
Will you?

00:14:40.316 --> 00:14:41.484
Thank you.

00:14:41.508 --> 00:14:45.096
(Applause)

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.310
Thank you.

00:14:46.334 --> 00:14:49.580
(Applause)
