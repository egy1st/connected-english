00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.626
When I was seven years old,

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.761
some well-meaning adult asked me
what I wanted to be when I grew up.

00:00:06.785 --> 00:00:08.803
Proudly, I said: "An artist."

00:00:08.827 --> 00:00:10.188
"No, you don't," he said,

00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:12.494
"You can't make a living being an artist!"

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:15.990
My little seven-year-old
Picasso dreams were crushed.

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:17.686
But I gathered myself,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.569
went off in search of a new dream,

00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:22.451
eventually settling on being a scientist,

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:25.119
perhaps something like
the next Albert Einstein.

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:27.724
(Laughter)

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.087
I have always loved math and science,

00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:31.622
later, coding.

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:34.665
And so I decided to study
computer programming in college.

00:00:35.312 --> 00:00:36.463
In my junior year,

00:00:36.487 --> 00:00:40.278
my computer graphics professor
showed us these wonderful short films.

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:44.128
It was the first computer animation
any of us had ever seen.

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.346
I watched these films
in wonder, transfixed,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.581
fireworks going off in my head,

00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:52.403
thinking, "That is what
I want to do with my life."

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.539
The idea that all the math, science
and code I had been learning

00:00:56.563 --> 00:00:59.701
could come together to create
these worlds and characters

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.587
and stories I connected with,

00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:03.142
was pure magic for me.

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:06.015
Just two years later, I started working

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.058
at the place that made those films,
Pixar Animation Studios.

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:11.812
It was here I learned how
we actually execute those films.

00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:13.462
To create our movies,

00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:16.255
we create a three-dimensional
world inside the computer.

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:20.525
We start with a point that makes
a line that makes a face

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.257
that creates characters,

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.953
or trees and rocks
that eventually become a forest.

00:01:25.326 --> 00:01:27.438
And because it's
a three-dimensional world,

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.858
we can move a camera
around inside that world.

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.417
I was fascinated by all of it.

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.722
But then I got my first taste of lighting.

00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:40.230
Lighting in practice is placing lights
inside this three-dimensional world.

00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:42.974
I actually have icons of lights
I move around in there.

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:44.720
Here you can see I've added a light,

00:01:44.744 --> 00:01:47.608
I'm turning on the rough version
of lighting in our software,

00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:48.863
turn on shadows

00:01:48.887 --> 00:01:50.291
and placing the light.

00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:51.482
As I place a light,

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:54.218
I think about what it might
look like in real life,

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:58.168
but balance that out with what we need
artistically and for the story.

00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:02.131
So it might look like this at first,

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.569
but as we adjust this and move that

00:02:04.593 --> 00:02:06.138
in weeks of work,

00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:08.377
in rough form it might look like this,

00:02:09.252 --> 00:02:11.401
and in final form, like this.

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:20.357
There's this moment in lighting
that made me fall utterly in love with it.

00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:22.131
It's where we go from this

00:02:22.807 --> 00:02:24.021
to this.

00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:26.581
It's the moment where
all the pieces come together,

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:29.208
and suddenly the world comes to life

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:31.620
as if it's an actual place that exists.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.716
This moment never gets old,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.608
especially for that little seven-year-old
girl that wanted to be an artist.

00:02:37.632 --> 00:02:38.785
As I learned to light,

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.340
I learned about using light
to help tell story,

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:44.173
to set the time of day,

00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:46.810
to create the mood,

00:02:47.978 --> 00:02:49.879
to guide the audience's eye,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.009
how to make a character look appealing

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:54.990
or stand out in a busy set.

00:02:56.224 --> 00:02:57.534
Did you see WALL-E?

00:02:57.558 --> 00:02:58.597
(Laughter)

00:02:58.621 --> 00:02:59.834
There he is.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.713
As you can see,

00:03:02.737 --> 00:03:05.444
we can create any world that we want
inside the computer.

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:08.166
We can make a world with monsters,

00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:10.666
with robots that fall in love,

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.335
we can even make pigs fly.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.772
(Laughter)

00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:20.138
While this is an incredible thing,

00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:22.637
this untethered artistic freedom,

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.643
it can create chaos.

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:27.518
It can create unbelievable worlds,

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:29.026
unbelievable movement,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.200
things that are jarring to the audience.

00:03:31.224 --> 00:03:33.985
So to combat this, we tether
ourselves with science.

00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:36.406
We use science and the world we know

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.780
as a backbone,

00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:41.278
to ground ourselves in something
relatable and recognizable.

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:44.335
"Finding Nemo" is an excellent
example of this.

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.004
A major portion of the movie
takes place underwater.

00:03:47.028 --> 00:03:49.278
But how do you make it look underwater?

00:03:49.302 --> 00:03:50.933
In early research and development,

00:03:50.957 --> 00:03:54.855
we took a clip of underwater footage
and recreated it in the computer.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.140
Then we broke it back down

00:03:56.164 --> 00:03:58.938
to see which elements make up
that underwater look.

00:03:59.526 --> 00:04:01.133
One of the most critical elements

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:03.339
was how the light travels
through the water.

00:04:03.363 --> 00:04:06.159
So we coded up a light
that mimics this physics --

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:07.927
first, the visibility of the water,

00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:10.060
and then what happens with the color.

00:04:10.503 --> 00:04:14.045
Objects close to the eye
have their full, rich colors.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.272
As light travels deeper into the water,

00:04:16.296 --> 00:04:18.206
we lose the red wavelengths,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.574
then the green wavelengths,

00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:21.948
leaving us with blue at the far depths.

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:25.766
In this clip you can see
two other important elements.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.812
The first is the surge and swell,

00:04:27.836 --> 00:04:29.553
or the invisible underwater current

00:04:29.577 --> 00:04:32.762
that pushes the bits of particulate
around in the water.

00:04:32.786 --> 00:04:34.803
The second is the caustics.

00:04:34.827 --> 00:04:36.337
These are the ribbons of light,

00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:38.385
like you might see
on the bottom of a pool,

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.959
that are created when the sun
bends through the crests

00:04:40.983 --> 00:04:43.657
of the ripples and waves
on the ocean's surface.

00:04:45.038 --> 00:04:46.336
Here we have the fog beams.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.015
These give us color depth cues,

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.134
but also tells which direction is up

00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:52.434
in shots where we don't
see the water surface.

00:04:52.788 --> 00:04:54.907
The other really cool thing
you can see here

00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:58.091
is that we lit that particulate
only with the caustics,

00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:00.773
so that as it goes in and out
of those ribbons of light,

00:05:00.797 --> 00:05:02.310
it appears and disappears,

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:05.403
lending a subtle, magical
sparkle to the underwater.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.072
You can see how we're using the science --

00:05:09.096 --> 00:05:11.972
the physics of water,
light and movement --

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:14.042
to tether that artistic freedom.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.891
But we are not beholden to it.

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:18.714
We considered each of these elements

00:05:18.738 --> 00:05:21.752
and which ones had to be
scientifically accurate

00:05:21.776 --> 00:05:25.858
and which ones we could push and pull
to suit the story and the mood.

00:05:25.882 --> 00:05:29.691
We realized early on that color
was one we had some leeway with.

00:05:29.715 --> 00:05:32.327
So here's a traditionally colored
underwater scene.

00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:35.192
But here, we can take Sydney Harbor
and push it fairly green

00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:37.476
to suit the sad mood of what's happening.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:41.574
In this scene, it's really important
we see deep into the underwater,

00:05:41.598 --> 00:05:44.265
so we understand what
the East Australian Current is,

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.677
that the turtles are diving into
and going on this roller coaster ride.

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:49.638
So we pushed the visibility of the water

00:05:49.662 --> 00:05:52.365
well past anything you would
ever see in real life.

00:05:52.843 --> 00:05:54.005
Because in the end,

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:58.653
we are not trying to recreate
the scientifically correct real world,

00:05:58.677 --> 00:06:00.717
we're trying to create a believable world,

00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:04.688
one the audience can immerse
themselves in to experience the story.

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:08.067
We use science to create
something wonderful.

00:06:08.522 --> 00:06:12.818
We use story and artistic touch
to get us to a place of wonder.

00:06:13.578 --> 00:06:16.054
This guy, WALL-E, is a great
example of that.

00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:18.508
He finds beauty in the simplest things.

00:06:18.532 --> 00:06:21.621
But when he came in to lighting,
we knew we had a big problem.

00:06:21.978 --> 00:06:25.423
We got so geeked-out on making
WALL-E this convincing robot,

00:06:25.447 --> 00:06:28.827
that we made his binoculars
practically optically perfect.

00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:30.381
(Laughter)

00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:35.322
His binoculars are one of the most
critical acting devices he has.

00:06:35.346 --> 00:06:38.888
He doesn't have a face or even
traditional dialogue, for that matter.

00:06:38.912 --> 00:06:41.839
So the animators were heavily
dependent on the binoculars

00:06:41.863 --> 00:06:44.116
to sell his acting and emotions.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.219
We started lighting and we realized

00:06:46.243 --> 00:06:50.457
the triple lenses inside his binoculars
were a mess of reflections.

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:53.042
He was starting to look glassy-eyed.

00:06:53.066 --> 00:06:54.790
(Laughter)

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:58.228
Now, glassy-eyed
is a fundamentally awful thing

00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:00.268
when you are trying
to convince an audience

00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:03.775
that a robot has a personality
and he's capable of falling in love.

00:07:04.498 --> 00:07:08.022
So we went to work on these optically
perfect binoculars,

00:07:08.046 --> 00:07:11.748
trying to find a solution that would
maintain his true robot materials

00:07:11.772 --> 00:07:13.763
but solve this reflection problem.

00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:15.554
So we started with the lenses.

00:07:15.578 --> 00:07:16.970
Here's the flat-front lens,

00:07:16.994 --> 00:07:18.500
we have a concave lens

00:07:18.524 --> 00:07:19.781
and a convex lens.

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:21.910
And here you see all three together,

00:07:21.934 --> 00:07:23.819
showing us all these reflections.

00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:25.838
We tried turning them down,

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.558
we tried blocking them,

00:07:27.582 --> 00:07:29.022
nothing was working.

00:07:29.786 --> 00:07:30.937
You can see here,

00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:34.085
sometimes we needed something specific
reflected in his eyes --

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:35.260
usually Eve.

00:07:35.284 --> 00:07:38.815
So we couldn't just use some faked
abstract image on the lenses.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:40.989
So here we have Eve on the first lens,

00:07:41.013 --> 00:07:43.064
we put Eve on the second lens,

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.333
it's not working.

00:07:44.357 --> 00:07:45.517
We turn it down,

00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:47.217
it's still not working.

00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:49.571
And then we have our eureka moment.

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:53.411
We add a light to WALL-E
that accidentally leaks into his eyes.

00:07:54.092 --> 00:07:57.482
You can see it light up
these gray aperture blades.

00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:01.560
Suddenly, those aperture blades
are poking through that reflection

00:08:01.584 --> 00:08:03.369
the way nothing else has.

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:07.508
Now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye.

00:08:07.532 --> 00:08:10.181
As humans we have the white of our eye,

00:08:10.205 --> 00:08:11.356
the colored iris

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.601
and the black pupil.

00:08:12.948 --> 00:08:16.289
Now WALL-E has the black of an eye,

00:08:16.313 --> 00:08:17.840
the gray aperture blades

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:19.283
and the black pupil.

00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:23.331
Suddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul,

00:08:23.355 --> 00:08:26.233
like there's a character
with emotion inside.

00:08:28.038 --> 00:08:29.855
Later in the movie towards the end,

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:31.357
WALL-E loses his personality,

00:08:31.381 --> 00:08:32.959
essentially going dead.

00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:36.910
This is the perfect time to bring back
that glassy-eyed look.

00:08:37.553 --> 00:08:40.033
In the next scene,
WALL-E comes back to life.

00:08:40.057 --> 00:08:43.240
We bring that light back to bring
the aperture blades back,

00:08:43.264 --> 00:08:46.724
and he returns to that sweet,
soulful robot we've come to love.

00:08:50.444 --> 00:08:51.808
(Video) WALL-E: Eva?

00:08:54.841 --> 00:08:57.961
Danielle Feinberg: There's a beauty
in these unexpected moments --

00:08:57.985 --> 00:09:01.551
when you find the key
to unlocking a robot's soul,

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:04.738
the moment when you discover
what you want to do with your life.

00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:08.437
The jellyfish in "Finding Nemo"
was one of those moments for me.

00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:12.052
There are scenes in every movie
that struggle to come together.

00:09:12.076 --> 00:09:14.011
This was one of those scenes.

00:09:14.035 --> 00:09:16.169
The director had a vision for this scene

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:20.001
based on some wonderful footage
of jellyfish in the South Pacific.

00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:22.996
As we went along,

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.473
we were floundering.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:26.586
The reviews with the director

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.299
turned from the normal
look-and-feel conversation

00:09:29.323 --> 00:09:33.450
into more and more questions
about numbers and percentages.

00:09:34.085 --> 00:09:35.776
Maybe because unlike normal,

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.053
we were basing it on
something in real life,

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:40.662
or maybe just because we had lost our way.

00:09:40.686 --> 00:09:43.797
But it had become about using
our brain without our eyes,

00:09:43.821 --> 00:09:45.676
the science without the art.

00:09:46.251 --> 00:09:49.430
That scientific tether
was strangling the scene.

00:09:50.534 --> 00:09:52.380
But even through all the frustrations,

00:09:52.404 --> 00:09:54.439
I still believed it could be beautiful.

00:09:54.463 --> 00:09:56.122
So when it came in to lighting,

00:09:56.146 --> 00:09:57.377
I dug in.

00:09:58.149 --> 00:10:01.440
As I worked to balance
the blues and the pinks,

00:10:01.464 --> 00:10:04.280
the caustics dancing
on the jellyfish bells,

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:06.478
the undulating fog beams,

00:10:06.502 --> 00:10:08.924
something promising began to appear.

00:10:09.686 --> 00:10:12.913
I came in one morning and checked
the previous night's work.

00:10:12.937 --> 00:10:14.413
And I got excited.

00:10:14.437 --> 00:10:16.545
And then I showed it
to the lighting director

00:10:16.569 --> 00:10:17.744
and she got excited.

00:10:17.768 --> 00:10:22.184
Soon, I was showing to the director
in a dark room full of 50 people.

00:10:22.563 --> 00:10:23.826
In director review,

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.908
you hope you might get some nice words,

00:10:26.349 --> 00:10:28.645
then you get some notes
and fixes, generally.

00:10:29.408 --> 00:10:31.845
And then, hopefully, you get a final,

00:10:31.869 --> 00:10:33.917
signaling to move on to the next stage.

00:10:34.462 --> 00:10:37.830
I gave my intro, and I played
the jellyfish scene.

00:10:38.703 --> 00:10:42.555
And the director was silent
for an uncomfortably long amount of time.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.747
Just long enough for me to think,

00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:47.627
"Oh no, this is doomed."

00:10:48.919 --> 00:10:50.679
And then he started clapping.

00:10:51.381 --> 00:10:53.773
And then the production
designer started clapping.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.384
And then the whole room was clapping.

00:11:02.285 --> 00:11:05.371
This is the moment
that I live for in lighting.

00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:07.558
The moment where it all comes together

00:11:07.582 --> 00:11:10.229
and we get a world that we can believe in.

00:11:10.718 --> 00:11:14.606
We use math, science and code
to create these amazing worlds.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.876
We use storytelling and art
to bring them to life.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.451
It's this interweaving of art and science

00:11:22.475 --> 00:11:26.138
that elevates the world
to a place of wonder,

00:11:26.162 --> 00:11:27.795
a place with soul,

00:11:27.819 --> 00:11:29.589
a place we can believe in,

00:11:30.262 --> 00:11:33.603
a place where the things
you imagine can become real --

00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:38.283
and a world where a girl suddenly realizes

00:11:38.307 --> 00:11:40.467
not only is she a scientist,

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:41.806
but also an artist.

00:11:42.544 --> 00:11:43.695
Thank you.

00:11:43.719 --> 00:11:46.999
(Applause)
