00:00:00.838 --> 00:00:03.021
Cancer affects all of us --

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:06.412
especially the ones that come
back over and over again,

00:00:06.436 --> 00:00:09.432
the highly invasive
and drug-resistant ones,

00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:11.835
the ones that defy medical treatment,

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.375
even when we throw our best drugs at them.

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:18.167
Engineering at the molecular level,

00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:20.839
working at the smallest of scales,

00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:23.386
can provide exciting new ways

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.338
to fight the most aggressive
forms of cancer.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.737
Cancer is a very clever disease.

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:31.923
There are some forms of cancer,

00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:36.682
which, fortunately, we've learned
how to address relatively well

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:40.098
with known and established
drugs and surgery.

00:00:40.627 --> 00:00:42.604
But there are some forms of cancer

00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:44.860
that don't respond to these approaches,

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:47.512
and the tumor survives or comes back,

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:49.665
even after an onslaught of drugs.

00:00:50.053 --> 00:00:54.047
We can think of these
very aggressive forms of cancer

00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:56.937
as kind of supervillains in a comic book.

00:00:57.455 --> 00:01:00.160
They're clever, they're adaptable,

00:01:00.184 --> 00:01:02.993
and they're very good at staying alive.

00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:06.406
And, like most supervillains these days,

00:01:06.996 --> 00:01:10.906
their superpowers come
from a genetic mutation.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.682
The genes that are modified
inside these tumor cells

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:20.973
can enable and encode for new
and unimagined modes of survival,

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.472
allowing the cancer cell to live through

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:25.861
even our best chemotherapy treatments.

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.296
One example is a trick
in which a gene allows a cell,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.804
even as the drug approaches the cell,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.039
to push the drug out,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.023
before the drug can have any effect.

00:01:40.047 --> 00:01:43.733
Imagine -- the cell effectively
spits out the drug.

00:01:44.393 --> 00:01:47.323
This is just one example
of the many genetic tricks

00:01:47.347 --> 00:01:49.947
in the bag of our supervillain, cancer.

00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:52.131
All due to mutant genes.

00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:57.438
So, we have a supervillain
with incredible superpowers.

00:01:57.462 --> 00:02:00.584
And we need a new and powerful
mode of attack.

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:04.788
Actually, we can turn off a gene.

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:08.669
The key is a set of molecules
known as siRNA.

00:02:09.143 --> 00:02:12.746
siRNA are short sequences of genetic code

00:02:13.253 --> 00:02:16.334
that guide a cell to block a certain gene.

00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:20.557
Each siRNA molecule
can turn off a specific gene

00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:22.151
inside the cell.

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:25.313
For many years since its discovery,

00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:27.287
scientists have been very excited

00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:30.668
about how we can apply
these gene blockers in medicine.

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:32.934
But, there is a problem.

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.418
siRNA works well inside the cell.

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:38.848
But if it gets exposed to the enzymes

00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:41.372
that reside in our bloodstream
or our tissues,

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:43.251
it degrades within seconds.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.085
It has to be packaged, protected
through its journey through the body

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.179
on its way to the final target
inside the cancer cell.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.057
So, here's our strategy.

00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:58.271
First, we'll dose the cancer cell
with siRNA, the gene blocker,

00:02:58.295 --> 00:02:59.891
and silence those survival genes,

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:02.003
and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug.

00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:04.179
But how do we carry that out?

00:03:04.764 --> 00:03:06.544
Using molecular engineering,

00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:10.893
we can actually design a superweapon

00:03:11.648 --> 00:03:13.899
that can travel through the bloodstream.

00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:16.919
It has to be tiny enough
to get through the bloodstream,

00:03:16.943 --> 00:03:19.814
it's got to be small enough
to penetrate the tumor tissue,

00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:24.513
and it's got to be tiny enough
to be taken up inside the cancer cell.

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.651
To do this job well,

00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:31.480
it has to be about one one-hundredth
the size of a human hair.

00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:35.605
Let's take a closer look
at how we can build this nanoparticle.

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:39.543
First, let's start
with the nanoparticle core.

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:43.367
It's a tiny capsule that contains
the chemotherapy drug.

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:47.566
This is the poison that will
actually end the tumor cell's life.

00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:51.937
Around this core, we'll wrap a very thin,

00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:54.794
nanometers-thin blanket of siRNA.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.452
This is our gene blocker.

00:03:57.093 --> 00:04:00.682
Because siRNA is strongly
negatively charged,

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:02.263
we can protect it

00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:07.012
with a nice, protective layer
of positively charged polymer.

00:04:07.503 --> 00:04:10.760
The two oppositely charged
molecules stick together

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:12.220
through charge attraction,

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:14.378
and that provides us
with a protective layer

00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:17.453
that prevents the siRNA
from degrading in the bloodstream.

00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:19.406
We're almost done.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.890
(Laughter)

00:04:20.914 --> 00:04:24.992
But there is one more big obstacle
we have to think about.

00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:27.408
In fact, it may be the biggest
obstacle of all.

00:04:27.432 --> 00:04:29.406
How do we deploy this superweapon?

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.984
I mean, every good weapon
needs to be targeted,

00:04:32.008 --> 00:04:36.073
we have to target this superweapon
to the supervillain cells

00:04:36.097 --> 00:04:38.047
that reside in the tumor.

00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:41.344
But our bodies have a natural
immune-defense system:

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:43.867
cells that reside in the bloodstream

00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:46.236
and pick out things that don't belong,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.559
so that it can destroy or eliminate them.

00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:53.019
And guess what? Our nanoparticle
is considered a foreign object.

00:04:53.718 --> 00:04:57.817
We have to sneak our nanoparticle
past the tumor defense system.

00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:04.095
We have to get it past this mechanism
of getting rid of the foreign object

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:05.539
by disguising it.

00:05:05.563 --> 00:05:09.908
So we add one more
negatively charged layer

00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:11.256
around this nanoparticle,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.718
which serves two purposes.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.108
First, this outer layer is one
of the naturally charged,

00:05:17.132 --> 00:05:20.845
highly hydrated polysaccharides
that resides in our body.

00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:26.289
It creates a cloud of water molecules
around the nanoparticle

00:05:26.313 --> 00:05:29.384
that gives us an invisibility
cloaking effect.

00:05:30.257 --> 00:05:32.974
This invisibility cloak allows
the nanoparticle

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:34.604
to travel through the bloodstream

00:05:34.628 --> 00:05:37.393
long and far enough to reach the tumor,

00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:39.556
without getting eliminated by the body.

00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:44.513
Second, this layer contains molecules

00:05:44.537 --> 00:05:47.736
which bind specifically to our tumor cell.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.710
Once bound, the cancer cell
takes up the nanoparticle,

00:05:52.734 --> 00:05:57.108
and now we have our nanoparticle
inside the cancer cell

00:05:57.132 --> 00:05:58.805
and ready to deploy.

00:05:59.304 --> 00:06:01.541
Alright! I feel the same way. Let's go!

00:06:01.565 --> 00:06:07.747
(Applause)

00:06:08.057 --> 00:06:11.283
The siRNA is deployed first.

00:06:12.287 --> 00:06:13.913
It acts for hours,

00:06:13.937 --> 00:06:18.505
giving enough time to silence
and block those survival genes.

00:06:19.398 --> 00:06:23.336
We have now disabled
those genetic superpowers.

00:06:23.725 --> 00:06:26.954
What remains is a cancer cell
with no special defenses.

00:06:26.978 --> 00:06:29.880
Then, the chemotherapy drug
comes out of the core

00:06:29.904 --> 00:06:33.488
and destroys the tumor cell
cleanly and efficiently.

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:36.565
With sufficient gene blockers,

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.799
we can address many
different kinds of mutations,

00:06:39.823 --> 00:06:42.184
allowing the chance to sweep out tumors,

00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:44.399
without leaving behind any bad guys.

00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:47.527
So, how does our strategy work?

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:53.504
We've tested these nanostructure
particles in animals

00:06:53.528 --> 00:06:57.111
using a highly aggressive form
of triple-negative breast cancer.

00:06:57.135 --> 00:06:59.690
This triple-negative breast cancer
exhibits the gene

00:06:59.714 --> 00:07:03.189
that spits out cancer drug
as soon as it is delivered.

00:07:03.742 --> 00:07:08.913
Usually, doxorubicin -- let's call
it "dox" -- is the cancer drug

00:07:08.937 --> 00:07:11.746
that is the first line of treatment
for breast cancer.

00:07:12.178 --> 00:07:17.948
So, we first treated our animals
with a dox core, dox only.

00:07:18.661 --> 00:07:20.868
The tumor slowed their rate of growth,

00:07:20.892 --> 00:07:22.332
but they still grew rapidly,

00:07:22.356 --> 00:07:24.684
doubling in size
over a period of two weeks.

00:07:25.297 --> 00:07:28.395
Then, we tried
our combination superweapon.

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:33.827
A nanolayer particle with siRNA
against the chemo pump,

00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:36.846
plus, we have the dox in the core.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.185
And look -- we found that not only
did the tumors stop growing,

00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:43.725
they actually decreased in size

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:46.164
and were eliminated in some cases.

00:07:46.188 --> 00:07:49.444
The tumors were actually regressing.

00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:56.841
(Applause)

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.628
What's great about this approach
is that it can be personalized.

00:08:01.652 --> 00:08:04.488
We can add many different layers of siRNA

00:08:04.512 --> 00:08:08.070
to address different mutations
and tumor defense mechanisms.

00:08:08.094 --> 00:08:11.379
And we can put different drugs
into the nanoparticle core.

00:08:11.946 --> 00:08:15.153
As doctors learn how to test patients

00:08:15.177 --> 00:08:18.951
and understand certain
tumor genetic types,

00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:22.717
they can help us determine which patients
can benefit from this strategy

00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:25.019
and which gene blockers we can use.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.313
Ovarian cancer strikes
a special chord with me.

00:08:29.337 --> 00:08:31.310
It is a very aggressive cancer,

00:08:31.334 --> 00:08:34.219
in part because it's discovered
at very late stages,

00:08:34.243 --> 00:08:35.690
when it's highly advanced

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:37.990
and there are a number
of genetic mutations.

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:41.555
After the first round of chemotherapy,

00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:45.969
this cancer comes back
for 75 percent of patients.

00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:49.159
And it usually comes back
in a drug-resistant form.

00:08:50.215 --> 00:08:51.909
High-grade ovarian cancer

00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:54.100
is one of the biggest
supervillains out there.

00:08:54.124 --> 00:08:56.036
And we're now directing our superweapon

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.376
toward its defeat.

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:00.637
As a researcher,

00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:03.516
I usually don't get to work with patients.

00:09:04.164 --> 00:09:06.581
But I recently met a mother

00:09:06.605 --> 00:09:11.502
who is an ovarian cancer survivor,
Mimi, and her daughter, Paige.

00:09:12.257 --> 00:09:16.361
I was deeply inspired
by the optimism and strength

00:09:16.385 --> 00:09:18.478
that both mother and daughter displayed

00:09:19.495 --> 00:09:22.187
and by their story of courage and support.

00:09:23.119 --> 00:09:26.522
At this event, we spoke
about the different technologies

00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:27.925
directed at cancer.

00:09:28.355 --> 00:09:29.664
And Mimi was in tears

00:09:29.688 --> 00:09:32.515
as she explained how learning
about these efforts

00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:34.749
gives her hope for future generations,

00:09:34.773 --> 00:09:36.658
including her own daughter.

00:09:37.449 --> 00:09:38.863
This really touched me.

00:09:39.524 --> 00:09:42.703
It's not just about building
really elegant science.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.239
It's about changing people's lives.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.541
It's about understanding
the power of engineering

00:09:49.565 --> 00:09:51.446
on the scale of molecules.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.553
I know that as students like Paige
move forward in their careers,

00:09:55.577 --> 00:09:57.017
they'll open new possibilities

00:09:57.041 --> 00:10:00.431
in addressing some of the big
health problems in the world --

00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:05.454
including ovarian cancer, neurological
disorders, infectious disease --

00:10:06.104 --> 00:10:10.045
just as chemical engineering has
found a way to open doors for me,

00:10:10.437 --> 00:10:13.071
and has provided a way of engineering

00:10:13.095 --> 00:10:16.627
on the tiniest scale,
that of molecules,

00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:19.214
to heal on the human scale.

00:10:19.797 --> 00:10:20.955
Thank you.

00:10:20.979 --> 00:10:29.539
(Applause)
