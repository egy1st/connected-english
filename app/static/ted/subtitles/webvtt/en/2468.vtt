00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.256
Extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.976
and it is my job,
my responsibility, as an astronomer

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.320
to remind people that alien hypotheses
should always be a last resort.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.576
Now, I want to tell you
a story about that.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.176
It involves data from a NASA mission,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.160
ordinary people and one of the most
extraordinary stars in our galaxy.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.400
It began in 2009 with the launch
of NASA's Kepler mission.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.056
Kepler's main scientific objective

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.056
was to find planets
outside of our solar system.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.656
It did this by staring
at a single field in the sky,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.520
this one, with all the tiny boxes.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.896
And in this one field,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.336
it monitored the brightness
of over 150,000 stars

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.776
continuously for four years,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.440
taking a data point every 30 minutes.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.496
It was looking for what
astronomers call a transit.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.536
This is when the planet's orbit
is aligned in our line of sight,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.696
just so that the planet
crosses in front of a star.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.096
And when this happens,
it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.840
which you can see as a dip in this curve.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.016
And so the team at NASA
had developed very sophisticated computers

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.760
to search for transits
in all the Kepler data.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.056
At the same time
of the first data release,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.200
astronomers at Yale
were wondering an interesting thing:

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.600
What if computers missed something?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.720
And so we launched the citizen
science project called Planet Hunters

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.960
to have people look at the same data.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.376
The human brain has an amazing ability
for pattern recognition,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.616
sometimes even better than a computer.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.176
However, there was a lot
of skepticism around this.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.736
My colleague, Debra Fischer,
founder of the Planet Hunters project,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.736
said that people at the time were saying,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.880
"You're crazy. There's no way
that a computer will miss a signal."

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.776
And so it was on, the classic
human versus machine gamble.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.976
And if we found one planet,
we would be thrilled.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.456
When I joined the team four years ago,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.920
we had already found a couple.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.016
And today, with the help
of over 300,000 science enthusiasts,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.816
we have found dozens,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.096
and we've also found
one of the most mysterious stars

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.320
in our galaxy.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.496
So to understand this,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.720
let me show you what a normal transit
in Kepler data looks like.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.056
On this graph on the left-hand side
you have the amount of light,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.936
and on the bottom is time.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.016
The white line
is light just from the star,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.416
what astronomers call a light curve.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.296
Now, when a planet transits a star,
it blocks out a little bit of this light,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.776
and the depth of this transit
reflects the size of the object itself.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.416
And so, for example, let's take Jupiter.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.576
Planets don't get
much bigger than Jupiter.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.376
Jupiter will make a one percent drop
in a star's brightness.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.576
Earth, on the other hand,
is 11 times smaller than Jupiter,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.416
and the signal
is barely visible in the data.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.720
So back to our mystery.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.400
A few years ago, Planet Hunters were
sifting through data looking for transits,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.160
and they spotted a mysterious signal
coming from the star KIC 8462852.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.936
The observations in May of 2009
were the first they spotted,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.818
and they started talking about this
in the discussion forums.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.416
They said and object like Jupiter

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.336
would make a drop like this
in the star's light,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.696
but they were also saying it was giant.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.936
You see, transits normally
only last for a few hours,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.080
and this one lasted for almost a week.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.416
They were also saying
that it looks asymmetric,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.696
meaning that instead of the clean,
U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.216
it had this strange slope
that you can see on the left side.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.576
This seemed to indicate

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.976
that whatever was getting in the way
and blocking the starlight

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.920
was not circular like a planet.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.136
There are few more dips that happened,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.520
but for a couple of years,
it was pretty quiet.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.560
And then in March of 2011, we see this.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.216
The star's light drops
by a whole 15 percent,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.416
and this is huge compared to a planet,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.440
which would only make a one percent drop.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.016
We described this feature
as both smooth and clean.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.056
It also is asymmetric,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.736
having a gradual dimming
that lasts almost a week,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.920
and then it snaps right back up to normal
in just a matter of days.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.176
And again, after this, not much happens

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.896
until February of 2013.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.536
Things start to get really crazy.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.056
There is a huge complex of dips
in the light curve that appear,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.216
and they last for like a hundred days,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.480
all the way up
into the Kepler mission's end.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.256
These dips have variable shapes.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.496
Some are very sharp, and some are broad,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.776
and they also have variable durations.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.960
Some last just for a day or two,
and some for more than a week.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.456
And there's also up and down trends
within some of these dips,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.160
almost like several independent events
were superimposed on top of each other.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.136
And at this time, this star drops
in its brightness over 20 percent.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.303
This means that whatever
is blocking its light

00:05:29.327 --> 00:05:33.767
has an area of over 1,000 times
the area of our planet Earth.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.440
This is truly remarkable.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.736
And so the citizen scientists,
when they saw this,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.456
they notified the science team
that they found something weird enough

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.920
that it might be worth following up.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.736
And so when the science team looked at it,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.141
we're like, "Yeah, there's probably
just something wrong with the data."

00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:54.696
But we looked really, really, really hard,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.120
and the data were good.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.776
And so what was happening
had to be astrophysical,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.456
meaning that something in space
was getting in the way

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.880
and blocking starlight.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.456
And so at this point,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.056
we set out to learn
everything we could about the star

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.000
to see if we could find any clues
to what was going on.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.896
And the citizen scientists
who helped us in this discovery,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.456
they joined along for the ride

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.560
watching science in action firsthand.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.456
First, somebody said, you know,
what if this star was very young

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.080
and it still had the cloud of material
it was born from surrounding it.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.456
And then somebody else said,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.256
well, what if the star
had already formed planets,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.496
and two of these planets had collided,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.640
similar to the Earth-Moon forming event.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.976
Well, both of these theories
could explain part of the data,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.416
but the difficulties were that the star
showed no signs of being young,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.376
and there was no glow
from any of the material

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.496
that was heated up by the star's light,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.376
and you would expect this
if the star was young

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.960
or if there was a collision
and a lot of dust was produced.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.416
And so somebody else said,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.416
well, how about a huge swarm of comets

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.096
that are passing by this star
in a very elliptical orbit?

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.520
Well, it ends up that this is actually
consistent with our observations.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.256
But I agree, it does feel
a little contrived.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.576
You see, it would take hundreds of comets

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.240
to reproduce what we're observing.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.776
And these are only the comets

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.416
that happen to pass
between us and the star.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.896
And so in reality, we're talking
thousands to tens of thousands of comets.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.376
But of all the bad ideas we had,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.536
this one was the best.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.496
And so we went ahead
and published our findings.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.736
Now, let me tell you, this was one
of the hardest papers I ever wrote.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.096
Scientists are meant to publish results,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.280
and this situation was far from that.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.096
And so we decided
to give it a catchy title,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.296
and we called it: "Where's The Flux?"

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.400
I will let you work out the acronym.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.880
(Laughter)

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.536
So this isn't the end of the story.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.736
Around the same time
I was writing this paper,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.896
I met with a colleague
of mine, Jason Wright,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.136
and he was also writing a paper
on Kepler data.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.336
And he was saying that with Kepler's
extreme precision,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.216
it could actually detect
alien megastructures around stars,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.440
but it didn't.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.480
And then I showed him this weird data
that our citizen scientists had found,

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.775
and he said to me,

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.576
"Aw crap, Tabby.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.559
Now I have to rewrite my paper."

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.640
So yes, the natural
explanations were weak,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.056
and we were curious now.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.256
So we had to find a way
to rule out aliens.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.136
So together, we convinced
a colleague of ours

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.416
who works on SETI, the Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.360
that this would be
an extraordinary target to pursue.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.856
We wrote a proposal to observe the star

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.056
with the world's largest radio telescope
at the Green Bank Observatory.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.456
A couple months later,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.720
news of this proposal
got leaked to the press

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.216
and now there are thousands of articles,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.376
over 10,000 articles, on this star alone.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.240
And if you search Google Images,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.120
this is what you'll find.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.096
Now, you may be wondering,
OK, Tabby, well,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.976
how do aliens actually explain
this light curve?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.296
OK, well, imagine a civilization
that's much more advanced than our own.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.640
In this hypothetical circumstance,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.336
this civilization would have exhausted
the energy supply of their home planet,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.536
so where could they get more energy?

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.360
Well, they have a host star
just like we have a sun,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.296
and so if they were able
to capture more energy from this star,

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.280
then that would solve their energy needs.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.216
So they would go
and build huge structures.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.016
These giant megastructures,

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.760
like ginormous solar panels,
are called Dyson spheres.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.736
This image above

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.936
are lots of artists' impressions
of Dyson spheres.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.976
It's really hard to provide perspective
on the vastness of these things,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.816
but you can think of it this way.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.880
The Earth-Moon distance
is a quarter of a million miles.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.936
The simplest element
on one of these structures

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.400
is 100 times that size.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.720
They're enormous.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.496
And now imagine one of these structures
in motion around a star.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.616
You can see how it would produce
anomalies in the data

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.856
such as uneven, unnatural looking dips.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.856
But it remains that even
alien megastructures

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.296
cannot defy the laws of physics.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.760
You see, anything that uses
a lot of energy

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.560
is going to produce heat,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.816
and we don't observe this.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.536
But it could be something as simple

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.016
as they're just reradiating it away
in another direction,

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.240
just not at Earth.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.440
Another idea that's one
of my personal favorites

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.096
is that we had just witnessed
an interplanetary space battle

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.120
and the catastrophic
destruction of a planet.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.776
Now, I admit that this
would produce a lot of dust

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.696
that we don't observe.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.056
But if we're already invoking aliens
in this explanation,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.776
then who is to say they didn't
efficiently clean up all this mess

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.336
for recycling purposes?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.376
(Laughter)

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.360
You can see how this quickly
captures your imagination.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.016
Well, there you have it.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.256
We're in a situation that could unfold

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.696
to be a natural phenomenon
we don't understand

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.280
or an alien technology
we don't understand.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.840
Personally, as a scientist,
my money is on the natural explanation.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.360
But don't get me wrong, I do think
it would be awesome to find aliens.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.320
Either way, there is something new
and really interesting to discover.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.896
So what happens next?

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.576
We need to continue to observe this star

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.016
to learn more about what's happening.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.616
But professional astronomers, like me,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.456
we have limited resources
for this kind of thing,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.400
and Kepler is on to a different mission.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.616
And I'm happy to say that once again,

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.760
citizen scientists have come in
and saved the day.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.336
You see, this time,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.240
amateur astronomers
with their backyard telescopes

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.096
stepped up immediately
and started observing this star nightly

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.616
at their own facilities,

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.440
and I am so excited to see what they find.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.696
What's amazing to me is that this star
would have never been found by computers

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.360
because we just weren't looking
for something like this.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.656
And what's more exciting

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.320
is that there's more data to come.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.176
There are new missions that are coming up

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.880
that are observing millions more stars

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.240
all over the sky.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.800
And just think: What will it mean
when we find another star like this?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.600
And what will it mean
if we don't find another star like this?

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.496
Thank you.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:33.441
(Applause)
