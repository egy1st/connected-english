00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.816
People returning to work
after a career break:

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.016
I call them relaunchers.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.896
These are people who have taken
career breaks for elder care,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.736
for childcare reasons,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.456
pursuing a personal interest

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.680
or a personal health issue.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.536
Closely related are
career transitioners of all kinds:

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.896
veterans, military spouses,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.336
retirees coming out of retirement

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.080
or repatriating expats.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.695
Returning to work
after a career break is hard

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.736
because of a disconnect
between the employers

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.656
and the relaunchers.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.656
Employers can view hiring people
with a gap on their resume

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.776
as a high-risk proposition,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.656
and individuals on career break
can have doubts about their abilities

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.256
to relaunch their careers,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.600
especially if they've been out
for a long time.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.080
This disconnect is a problem
that I'm trying to help solve.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.160
Now, successful relaunchers
are everywhere and in every field.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.416
This is Sami Kafala.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.176
He's a nuclear physicist in the UK

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.120
who took a five-year career break
to be home with his five children.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.096
The Singapore press recently wrote
about nurses returning to work

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.176
after long career breaks.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.216
And speaking of long career breaks,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.520
this is Mimi Kahn.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.296
She's a social worker
in Orange County, California,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.656
who returned to work
in a social services organization

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.456
after a 25-year career break.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.840
That's the longest career break
that I'm aware of.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.816
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.680
took a five-year career break
early in her career.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.920
And this is Tracy Shapiro,
who took a 13-year career break.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.336
Tracy answered a call for essays
by the Today Show

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.776
from people who were trying
to return to work

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.640
but having a difficult time of it.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.616
Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five
who loved her time at home,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.176
but she had gone through a divorce
and needed to return to work,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.136
plus she really wanted
to bring work back into her life

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.800
because she loved working.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.096
Tracy was doing what so many of us do

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.856
when we feel like we've put in
a good day in the job search.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.856
She was looking for a finance
or accounting role,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.576
and she had just spent
the last nine months

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.896
very diligently researching
companies online

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.680
and applying for jobs with no results.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.856
I met Tracy in June of 2011,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.416
when the Today Show asked me
if I could work with her

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.600
to see if I could help her
turn things around.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.616
The first thing I told Tracy
was she had to get out of the house.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.376
I told her she had to go public
with her job search

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.240
and tell everyone she knew
about her interest in returning to work.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.456
I also told her, "You are going
to have a lot of conversations

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.056
that don't go anywhere.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.336
Expect that, and don't
be discouraged by it.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.936
There will be a handful

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.800
that ultimately lead
to a job opportunity."

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.296
I'll tell you what happened
with Tracy in a little bit,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.749
but I want to share with you
a discovery that I made

00:03:05.773 --> 00:03:07.496
when I was returning to work

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.616
after my own career break of 11 years
out of the full-time workforce.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.880
And that is, that people's view of you
is frozen in time.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.976
What I mean by this is,
when you start to get in touch with people

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.736
and you get back in touch
with those people from the past,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.016
the people with whom you worked
or went to school,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.776
they are going to remember you as you were

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.616
before your career break.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.136
And that's even if your sense of self
has diminished over time,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.256
as happens with so many of us

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.176
the farther removed we are
from our professional identities.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.896
So for example,
you might think of yourself

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.400
as someone who looks like this.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.096
This is me, crazy after a day
of driving around in my minivan.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.320
Or here I am in the kitchen.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.296
But those people from the past,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.536
they don't know about any of this.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.096
They only remember you as you were,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.296
and it's a great confidence boost
to be back in touch with these people

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.960
and hear their enthusiasm
about your interest in returning to work.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.536
There's one more thing I remember vividly
from my own career break.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.935
And that was that I hardly kept up
with the business news.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.576
My background is in finance,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.016
and I hardly kept up with any news

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.976
when I was home caring
for my four young children.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.376
So I was afraid I'd go into an interview

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.760
and start talking about a company
that didn't exist anymore.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.736
So I had to resubscribe
to the Wall Street Journal

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.216
and read it for a good six months
cover to cover before I felt

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.160
like I had a handle on what was going on
in the business world again.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.536
I believe relaunchers
are a gem of the workforce,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.296
and here's why.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.136
Think about our life stage:

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.816
for those of us who took career breaks
for childcare reasons,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.816
we have fewer or no maternity leaves.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.336
We did that already.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.696
We have fewer spousal
or partner job relocations.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.176
We're in a more settled time of life.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.016
We have great work experience.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.056
We have a more mature perspective.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.656
We're not trying to find ourselves
at an employer's expense.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.896
Plus we have an energy,
an enthusiasm about returning to work

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.840
precisely because we've been
away from it for a while.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.216
On the flip side, I speak with employers,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.776
and here are two concerns
that employers have

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.696
about hiring relaunchers.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.776
The first one is, employers
are worried that relaunchers

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.840
are technologically obsolete.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.656
Now, I can tell you,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.256
having been technologically
obsolete myself at one point,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.960
that it's a temporary condition.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.656
I had done my financial analysis
so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.616
I don't know if anyone
can even remember back that far,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.856
but I had to relearn it on Excel.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.960
It actually wasn't that hard.
A lot of the commands are the same.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.816
I found PowerPoint much more challenging,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.000
but now I use PowerPoint all the time.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.616
I tell relaunchers that employers
expect them to come to the table

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.136
with a working knowledge
of basic office management software.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.896
And if they're not up to speed,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.296
then it's their
responsibility to get there.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.520
And they do.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.576
The second area of concern
that employers have about relaunchers

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.800
is they're worried that relaunchers
don't know what they want to do.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.656
I tell relaunchers that they need
to do the hard work

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.176
to figure out whether their interests
and skills have changed

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.776
or have not changed

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.616
while they have been on career break.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.896
That's not the employer's job.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.496
It's the relauncher's responsibility
to demonstrate to the employer

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.440
where they can add the most value.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.840
Back in 2010 I started noticing something.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.536
I had been tracking
return to work programs since 2008,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.856
and in 2010, I started noticing

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.776
the use of a short-term
paid work opportunity,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.256
whether it was called
an internship or not,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.616
but an internship-like experience,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.776
as a way for professionals
to return to work.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.576
I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.896
start corporate reentry
internship programs.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.360
I saw a returning engineer,
a nontraditional reentry candidate,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.936
apply for an entry-level
internship program in the military,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.320
and then get a permanent job afterward.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.576
I saw two universities
integrate internships

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.640
into mid-career executive
education programs.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.016
So I wrote a report
about what I was seeing,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.016
and it became this article
for Harvard Business Review

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.936
called "The 40-Year-Old Intern."

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.576
I have to thank the editors
there for that title,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.976
and also for this artwork

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.336
where you can see the 40-year-old intern
in the midst of all the college interns.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.536
And then, courtesy of Fox Business News,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.736
they called the concept
"The 50-Year-Old Intern."

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.576
(Laughter)

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.456
So five of the biggest
financial services companies

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.616
have reentry internship programs
for returning finance professionals.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.936
And at this point,
hundreds of people have participated.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.736
These internships are paid,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.496
and the people who move on
to permanent roles

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.200
are commanding competitive salaries.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.136
And now, seven of the biggest
engineering companies

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.456
are piloting reentry internship programs
for returning engineers

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.200
as part of an initiative
with the Society of Women Engineers.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.400
Now, why are companies embracing
the reentry internship?

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.416
Because the internship allows the employer

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.456
to base their hiring decision
on an actual work sample

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.535
instead of a series of interviews,

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.296
and the employer does not have to make
that permanent hiring decision

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.120
until the internship period is over.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.536
This testing out period
removes the perceived risk

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.136
that some managers attach
to hiring relaunchers,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.816
and they are attracting
excellent candidates

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.680
who are turning into great hires.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.200
Think about how far we have come.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.536
Before this, most employers
were not interested

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.896
in engaging with relaunchers at all.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.416
But now, not only
are programs being developed

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.976
specifically with relaunchers in mind,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.496
but you can't even apply
for these programs

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.200
unless you have a gap on your résumé.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.936
This is the mark of real change,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.216
of true institutional shift,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.776
because if we can solve
this problem for relaunchers,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.096
we can solve it for other
career transitioners too.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.056
In fact, an employer just told me

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.576
that their veterans return to work program

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.976
is based on their reentry
internship program.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.016
And there's no reason why there can't be
a retiree internship program.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.520
Different pool, same concept.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.856
So let me tell you
what happened with Tracy Shapiro.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.456
Remember that she had to tell
everyone she knew

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.480
about her interest in returning to work.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.976
Well, one critical conversation
with another parent in her community

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.096
led to a job offer for Tracy,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.896
and it was an accounting job
in a finance department.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.240
But it was a temp job.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.256
The company told her
there was a possibility

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.816
it could turn into something more,
but no guarantees.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.200
This was in the fall of 2011.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.736
Tracy loved this company,
and she loved the people

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.816
and the office was less
than 10 minutes from her house.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.056
So even though she had a second job offer

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.976
at another company
for a permanent full-time role,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.216
she decided to take her chances
with this internship

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.000
and hope for the best.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.376
Well, she ended up blowing away
all of their expectations,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.896
and the company not only
made her a permanent offer

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.016
at the beginning of 2012,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.656
but they made it even more
interesting and challenging,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.800
because they knew what Tracy could handle.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.856
Fast forward to 2015,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.456
Tracy's been promoted.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.896
They've paid for her
to get her MBA at night.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.240
She's even hired another relauncher
to work for her.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.216
Tracy's temp job was a tryout,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.896
just like an internship,

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.160
and it ended up being a win
for both Tracy and her employer.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.976
Now, my goal is to bring
the reentry internship concept

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.736
to more and more employers.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.576
But in the meantime,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.816
if you are returning to work
after a career break,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.856
don't hesitate to suggest an internship
or an internship-like arrangement

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.496
to an employer that does not have
a formal reentry internship program.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.816
Be their first success story,

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.480
and you can be the example
for more relaunchers to come.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.136
Thank you.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:48.325
(Applause)
