00:00:01.596 --> 00:00:04.318
Here are two reasons companies fail:

00:00:05.208 --> 00:00:07.167
they only do more of the same,

00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:10.659
or they only do what's new.

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:16.513
To me the real, real
solution to quality growth

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:20.102
is figuring out the balance
between two activities:

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:22.698
exploration and exploitation.

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:24.704
Both are necessary,

00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:27.441
but it can be too much of a good thing.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.386
Consider Facit.

00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:33.465
I'm actually old enough to remember them.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.657
Facit was a fantastic company.

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.472
They were born deep in the Swedish forest,

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:42.002
and they made the best
mechanical calculators in the world.

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:43.900
Everybody used them.

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:48.977
And what did Facit do when
the electronic calculator came along?

00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:52.414
They continued doing exactly the same.

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:56.671
In six months, they went
from maximum revenue ...

00:00:56.695 --> 00:00:57.931
and they were gone.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.800
Gone.

00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:03.696
To me, the irony about the Facit story

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.986
is hearing about the Facit engineers,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.093
who had bought cheap, small
electronic calculators in Japan

00:01:12.117 --> 00:01:15.778
that they used to double-check
their calculators.

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:17.215
(Laughter)

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:19.887
Facit did too much exploitation.

00:01:20.422 --> 00:01:22.876
But exploration can go wild, too.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.051
A few years back,

00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:28.101
I worked closely alongside
a European biotech company.

00:01:28.447 --> 00:01:30.806
Let's call them OncoSearch.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.487
The company was brilliant.

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:37.129
They had applications that promised
to diagnose, even cure,

00:01:37.153 --> 00:01:39.645
certain forms of blood cancer.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.720
Every day was about
creating something new.

00:01:43.744 --> 00:01:46.248
They were extremely innovative,

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.148
and the mantra was,
"When we only get it right,"

00:01:49.172 --> 00:01:51.830
or even, "We want it perfect."

00:01:52.687 --> 00:01:54.544
The sad thing is,

00:01:54.568 --> 00:01:56.466
before they became perfect --

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.419
even good enough --

00:01:58.443 --> 00:02:00.037
they became obsolete.

00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:04.352
OncoSearch did too much exploration.

00:02:05.602 --> 00:02:11.357
I first heard about exploration
and exploitation about 15 years ago,

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.881
when I worked as a visiting
scholar at Stanford University.

00:02:15.428 --> 00:02:18.144
The founder of the idea is Jim March.

00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:22.551
And to me the power of the idea
is its practicality.

00:02:23.168 --> 00:02:24.823
Exploration.

00:02:24.847 --> 00:02:28.217
Exploration is about
coming up with what's new.

00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:30.003
It's about search,

00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:31.470
it's about discovery,

00:02:31.494 --> 00:02:33.056
it's about new products,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.921
it's about new innovations.

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:38.595
It's about changing our frontiers.

00:02:39.408 --> 00:02:42.843
Our heroes are people
who have done exploration:

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:44.208
Madame Curie,

00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:45.390
Picasso,

00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:46.588
Neil Armstrong,

00:02:46.612 --> 00:02:48.771
Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.545
I come from Norway;

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.353
all our heroes are explorers,
and they deserve to be.

00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:00.430
We all know that exploration is risky.

00:03:00.454 --> 00:03:02.273
We don't know the answers,

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:04.368
we don't know if we're going to find them,

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.669
and we know that the risks are high.

00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:08.584
Exploitation is the opposite.

00:03:08.608 --> 00:03:11.685
Exploitation is taking
the knowledge we have

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.504
and making good, better.

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:17.647
Exploitation is about making
our trains run on time.

00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:21.972
It's about making good products
faster and cheaper.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.944
Exploitation is not risky --

00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:27.072
in the short term.

00:03:27.595 --> 00:03:29.401
But if we only exploit,

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:31.818
it's very risky in the long term.

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:36.261
And I think we all have memories
of the famous pop groups

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:39.236
who keep singing the same songs
again and again,

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.325
until they become obsolete
or even pathetic.

00:03:44.204 --> 00:03:46.448
That's the risk of exploitation.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:52.432
So if we take a long-term
perspective, we explore.

00:03:53.427 --> 00:03:56.604
If we take a short-term
perspective, we exploit.

00:03:57.693 --> 00:04:00.144
Small children, they explore all day.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.675
All day it's about exploration.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.739
As we grow older,

00:04:04.763 --> 00:04:08.641
we explore less because we have
more knowledge to exploit on.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.763
The same goes for companies.

00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:16.570
Companies become,
by nature, less innovative

00:04:16.594 --> 00:04:18.483
as they become more competent.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.493
And this is, of course,
a big worry to CEOs.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.919
And I hear very often questions
phrased in different ways.

00:04:27.943 --> 00:04:29.101
For example,

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:33.673
"How can I both effectively run
and reinvent my company?"

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:36.451
Or, "How can I make sure

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:40.836
that our company changes
before we become obsolete

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.474
or are hit by a crisis?"

00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:46.140
So, doing one well is difficult.

00:04:46.164 --> 00:04:49.931
Doing both well as the same time is art --

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:52.800
pushing both exploration and exploitation.

00:04:53.138 --> 00:04:54.634
So one thing we've found

00:04:54.658 --> 00:05:01.354
is only about two percent of companies
are able to effectively explore

00:05:01.378 --> 00:05:04.723
and exploit at the same time, in parallel.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.454
But when they do,

00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:09.427
the payoffs are huge.

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:12.726
So we have lots of great examples.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.466
We have NestlÃ© creating Nespresso,

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.512
we have Lego going into animated films,

00:05:18.536 --> 00:05:20.942
Toyota creating the hybrids,

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:23.437
Unilever pushing into sustainability --

00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:26.642
there are lots of examples,
and the benefits are huge.

00:05:27.812 --> 00:05:30.348
Why is balancing so difficult?

00:05:30.846 --> 00:05:33.476
I think it's difficult
because there are so many traps

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.150
that keep us where we are.

00:05:35.975 --> 00:05:38.338
So I'll talk about two,
but there are many.

00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:42.086
So let's talk about
the perpetual search trap.

00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:44.428
We discover something,

00:05:44.452 --> 00:05:47.307
but we don't have the patience
or the persistence

00:05:47.331 --> 00:05:49.659
to get at it and make it work.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:52.828
So instead of staying with it,
we create something new.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.152
But the same goes for that,

00:05:54.176 --> 00:05:55.927
then we're in the vicious circle

00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:59.263
of actually coming up with ideas
but being frustrated.

00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:02.701
OncoSearch was a good example.

00:06:02.725 --> 00:06:05.548
A famous example is, of course, Xerox.

00:06:06.607 --> 00:06:08.707
But we don't only see this in companies.

00:06:08.731 --> 00:06:11.245
We see this in the public sector as well.

00:06:11.726 --> 00:06:17.448
We all know that any kind
of effective reform of education,

00:06:17.472 --> 00:06:19.899
research, health care, even defense,

00:06:19.923 --> 00:06:23.326
takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:26.578
But still, we change much more often.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.975
We really don't give them the chance.

00:06:30.424 --> 00:06:33.444
Another trap is the success trap.

00:06:34.808 --> 00:06:37.555
Facit fell into the success trap.

00:06:38.275 --> 00:06:41.525
They literally held
the future in their hands,

00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:42.763
but they couldn't see it.

00:06:42.787 --> 00:06:46.542
They were simply so good
at making what they loved doing,

00:06:46.566 --> 00:06:48.232
that they wouldn't change.

00:06:49.187 --> 00:06:50.480
We are like that, too.

00:06:50.504 --> 00:06:53.251
When we know something well,
it's difficult to change.

00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:56.170
Bill Gates has said:

00:06:57.016 --> 00:07:00.016
"Success is a lousy teacher.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.614
It seduces us into thinking
we cannot fail."

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:06.367
That's the challenge with success.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:11.340
So I think there are some lessons,
and I think they apply to us.

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:13.105
And they apply to our companies.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.960
The first lesson is:
get ahead of the crisis.

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.518
And any company that's able to innovate

00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:24.338
is actually able to also buy
an insurance in the future.

00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:27.572
Netflix -- they could so easily
have been content

00:07:27.596 --> 00:07:30.460
with earlier generations of distribution,

00:07:30.484 --> 00:07:33.041
but they always -- and I think
they will always --

00:07:33.065 --> 00:07:35.040
keep pushing for the next battle.

00:07:35.572 --> 00:07:37.937
I see other companies that say,

00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:42.402
"I'll win the next innovation cycle,
whatever it takes."

00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:46.517
Second one: think in multiple time scales.

00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:48.256
I'll share a chart with you,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.138
and I think it's a wonderful one.

00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:52.174
Any company we look at,

00:07:52.198 --> 00:07:53.997
taking a one-year perspective

00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:56.298
and looking at the valuation
of the company,

00:07:56.322 --> 00:07:59.701
innovation typically accounts
for only about 30 percent.

00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:01.574
So when we think one year,

00:08:01.598 --> 00:08:03.880
innovation isn't really that important.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.058
Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective
on the same company --

00:08:08.082 --> 00:08:13.260
suddenly, innovation and ability
to renew account for 70 percent.

00:08:14.253 --> 00:08:15.730
But companies can't choose.

00:08:15.754 --> 00:08:19.660
They need to fund the journey
and lead the long term.

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:21.922
Third:

00:08:22.304 --> 00:08:23.541
invite talent.

00:08:23.974 --> 00:08:26.522
I don't think it's possible for any of us

00:08:26.546 --> 00:08:31.076
to be able to balance exploration
and exploitation by ourselves.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.806
I think it's a team sport.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.219
I think we need to allow challenging.

00:08:36.273 --> 00:08:41.163
I think the mark of a great company
is being open to be challenged,

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:45.410
and the mark of a good corporate board
is to constructively challenge.

00:08:46.264 --> 00:08:49.870
I think that's also what
good parenting is about.

00:08:50.858 --> 00:08:53.339
Last one: be skeptical of success.

00:08:54.133 --> 00:09:00.466
Maybe it's useful to think back
at the old triumph marches in Rome,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.986
when the generals, after a big victory,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.361
were given their celebration.

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:09.489
Riding into Rome on the carriage,

00:09:09.513 --> 00:09:13.735
they always had a companion
whispering in their ear,

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:16.245
"Remember, you're only human."

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:20.677
So I hope I made the point:

00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:23.723
balancing exploration and exploitation

00:09:23.747 --> 00:09:25.194
has a huge payoff.

00:09:25.218 --> 00:09:27.779
But it's difficult,
and we need to be conscious.

00:09:28.338 --> 00:09:32.783
I want to just point out two questions
that I think are useful.

00:09:33.397 --> 00:09:36.801
First question is,
looking at your own company:

00:09:37.446 --> 00:09:41.756
In which areas do you see
that the company is at the risk

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.024
of falling into success traps,

00:09:44.048 --> 00:09:46.579
of just going on autopilot?

00:09:47.105 --> 00:09:50.286
And what can you do to challenge?

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:53.242
Second question is:

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.791
When did I explore something new last,

00:09:57.815 --> 00:10:00.068
and what kind of effect did it have on me?

00:10:00.814 --> 00:10:03.028
Is that something I should do more of?

00:10:03.596 --> 00:10:04.845
In my case, yes.

00:10:06.657 --> 00:10:08.668
So let me leave you with this.

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:11.973
Whether you're an explorer by nature

00:10:11.997 --> 00:10:15.899
or whether you tend to exploit
what you already know,

00:10:15.923 --> 00:10:20.007
don't forget: the beauty
is in the balance.

00:10:21.392 --> 00:10:22.552
Thank you.

00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:25.197
(Applause)
