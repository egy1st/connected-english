00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.336
So there are lands
few and far between on Earth itself

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.680
that are hospitable to humans
by any measure,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.120
but survive we have.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.056
Our primitive ancestors, when they found
their homes and livelihood endangered,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.216
they dared to make their way
into unfamiliar territories

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.080
in search of better opportunities.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.976
And as the descendants of these explorers,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.280
we have their nomadic blood
coursing through our own veins.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.496
But at the same time,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.616
distracted by our bread and circuses

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.000
and embroiled in the wars
that we have waged on each other,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.000
it seems that we have forgotten
this desire to explore.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.160
We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.960
for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.816
and so content are we
with our living conditions

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.256
that we have grown complacent
and just too busy

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.200
to notice that its resources are finite,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.280
and that our Sun's life is also finite.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.176
While Mars and all the movies
made in its name

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.216
have reinvigorated
the ethos for space travel,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.616
few of us seem to truly realize
that our species' fragile constitution

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.040
is woefully unprepared
for long duration journeys into space.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.416
Let us take a trek
to your local national forest

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.256
for a quick reality check.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.976
So just a quick show of hands here:

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.576
how many of you think you would be able
to survive in this lush wilderness

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.800
for a few days?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.296
Well, that's a lot of you.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.520
How about a few weeks?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.256
That's a decent amount.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.480
How about a few months?

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.096
That's pretty good too.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.776
Now, let us imagine
that this local national forest

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.760
experiences an eternal winter.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.240
Same questions: how many of you think you
would be able to survive for a few days?

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.696
That's quite a lot.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.920
How about a few weeks?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.096
So for a fun twist, let us imagine
that the only source of water available

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.520
is trapped as frozen blocks
miles below the surface.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.176
Soil nutrients are so minimal
that no vegetation can be found,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.400
and of course hardly any atmosphere
exists to speak of.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.376
Such examples are only a few
of the many challenges we would face

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.240
on a planet like Mars.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.176
So how do we steel ourselves for voyages
whose destinations are so far removed

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.680
from a tropical vacation?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.160
Will we continuously ship supplies
from Planet Earth?

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.336
Build space elevators,
or impossible miles of transport belts

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.000
that tether your planet of choice
to our home planet?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.880
And how do we grow things like food
that grew up on Earth like us?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.640
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.960
In our species' journey
to find a new home under a new sun,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.576
we are more likely than not
going to be spending much time

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.160
in the journey itself,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.456
in space,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.160
on a ship, a hermetic flying can,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.840
possibly for many generations.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.896
The longest continuous amount of time
that any human has spent in space

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.800
is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.936
From astronauts' experiences in space,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.736
we know that spending time
in a microgravity environment

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.336
means bone loss, muscle atrophy,
cardiovascular problems,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.936
among many other complications

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.280
that range for the physiological
to the psychological.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.616
And what about macrogravity,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.136
or any other variation
in gravitational pull

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.080
of the planet that we find ourselves on?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.096
In short, our cosmic voyages
will be fraught with dangers

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.720
both known and unknown.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.976
So far we've been looking to this
new piece of mechanical technology

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.256
or that great next generation robot

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.720
as part of a lineup to ensure
our species safe passage in space.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.536
Wonderful as they are,
I believe the time has come

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.816
for us to complement
these bulky electronic giants

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.680
with what nature has already invented:

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.696
the microbe,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.936
a single-celled organism that is itself
a self-generating, self-replenishing,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.160
living machine.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.176
It requires fairly little to maintain,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.096
offers much flexibility in design

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.440
and only asks to be carried
in a single plastic tube.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.256
The field of study that has enabled us
to utilize the capabilities of the microbe

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.880
is known as synthetic biology.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.536
It comes from molecular biology,
which has given us antibiotics, vaccines

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.856
and better ways to observe
the physiological nuances

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.080
of the human body.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.496
Using the tools of synthetic biology,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.456
we can now edit the genes
of nearly any organism,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.416
microscopic or not,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.840
with incredible speed and fidelity.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.656
Given the limitations
of our man-made machines,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.656
synthetic biology will be a means for us
to engineer not only our food,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.416
our fuel and our environment,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.736
but also ourselves

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.376
to compensate
for our physical inadequacies

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.560
and to ensure our survival in space.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.216
To give you an example

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.056
of how we can use synthetic biology
for space exploration,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.000
let us return to the Mars environment.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.896
The Martian soil composition is similar
to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.800
with trace amounts of organic material.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.656
Let's say, hypothetically,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.416
what if martian soil
could actually support plant growth

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.280
without using Earth-derived nutrients?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.456
The first question
we should probably ask is,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.856
how would we make
our plants cold-tolerant?

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.976
Because, on average,
the temperature on Mars

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.760
is a very uninviting
negative 60 degrees centigrade.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.776
The next question we should ask is,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.256
how do we make
our plants drought-tolerant?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.096
Considering that most of the water
that forms as frost

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.960
evaporates more quickly
than I can say the word "evaporate."

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.720
Well, it turns out
we've already done things like this.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.776
By borrowing genes
for anti-freeze protein from fish

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.976
and genes for drought tolerance
from other plants like rice

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.696
and then stitching them
into the plants that need them,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.680
we now have plants that can tolerate
most droughts and freezes.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.096
They're known on Earth as GMOs,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.920
or genetically modified organisms,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.040
and we rely on them to feed
all the mouths of human civilization.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.576
Nature does stuff like this already,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.136
without our help.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.240
We have simply found
more precise ways to do it.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.960
So why would we want to change
the genetic makeup of plants for space?

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.696
Well, to not do so
would mean needing to engineer

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.136
endless acres of land
on an entirely new planet

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.656
by releasing trillions of gallons
of atmospheric gasses

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.720
and then constructing
a giant glass dome to contain it all.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.536
It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.080
that quickly becomes
a high-cost cargo transport mission.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.696
One of the best ways to ensure

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.816
that we will have the food supplies
and the air that we need

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.936
is to bring with us organisms
that have been engineered

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.520
to adapt to new and harsh environments.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.736
In essence, using engineered organisms
to help us terraform a planet

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.800
both in the short and long term.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.400
These organisms can then also
be engineered to make medicine or fuel.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.656
So we can use synthetic biology
to bring highly engineered plants with us,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.920
but what else can we do?

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.736
Well, I mentioned earlier
that we, as a species,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.080
were evolved uniquely for planet Earth.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.416
That fact has not changed much
in the last five minutes

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.880
that you were sitting here
and I was standing there.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.176
And so, if we were to dump
any of us on Mars right this minute,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.696
even given ample food, water, air

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.936
and a suit,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.336
we are likely to experience
very unpleasant health problems

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.656
from the amount of ionizing radiation
that bombards the surface

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.520
of planets like Mars that have little
or nonexistent atmosphere.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.296
Unless we plan
to stay holed up underground

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.960
for the duration of our stay
on every new planet,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.056
we must find better ways
of protecting ourselves

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.736
without needing to resort
to wearing a suit of armor

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.216
that weighs something
equal to your own body weight,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.520
or needing to hide behind a wall of lead.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.840
So let us appeal
to nature for inspiration.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.296
Among the plethora of life here on Earth,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.176
there's a subset of organisms
known as extremophiles,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.176
or lovers of extreme living conditions,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.656
if you'll remember
from high school biology.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.160
And among these organisms is a bacterium
by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.416
It is known to be able to withstand cold,
dehydration, vacuum, acid,

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.640
and, most notably, radiation.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.135
While its radiation
tolerance mechanisms are known,

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.559
we have yet to adapt
the relevant genes to mammals.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.136
To do so is not particularly easy.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.976
There are many facets
that go into its radiation tolerance,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.240
and it's not as simple
as transferring one gene.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.216
But given a little bit of human ingenuity

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.496
and a little bit of time,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.960
I think to do so is not very hard either.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.760
Even if we borrow just a fraction
of its ability to tolerate radiation,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.416
it would be infinitely better
than what we already have,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.400
which is just the melanin in our skin.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.576
Using the tools of synthetic biology,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.616
we can harness Deinococcus
radiodurans' ability

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.360
to thrive under otherwise
very lethal doses of radiation.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.240
As difficult as it is to see,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.240
homo sapiens, that is humans,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.496
evolves every day,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.440
and still continues to evolve.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.136
Thousands of years of human evolution

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.136
has not only given us
humans like Tibetans,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.736
who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.696
but also Argentinians,
who can ingest and metabolize arsenic,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.520
the chemical element
that can kill the average human being.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.056
Every day, the human body evolves
by accidental mutations

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.936
that equally accidentally
allow certain humans

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.200
to persevere in dismal situations.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.040
But, and this is a big but,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.656
such evolution requires two things
that we may not always have,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.120
or be able to afford,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.360
and they are death and time.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.576
In our species' struggle
to find our place in the universe,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.056
we may not always have the time necessary

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.616
for the natural evolution
of extra functions

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.640
for survival on non-Earth planets.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.856
We're living in what E.O. Wilson
has termed the age of gene circumvention,

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.256
during which we remedy our genetic defects
like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.880
with temporary external supplements.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.496
But with every passing day,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.696
we approach the age
of volitional evolution,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.696
a time during which we as a species

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.600
will have the capacity to decide
for ourselves our own genetic destiny.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.056
Augmenting the human body
with new abilities

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.160
is no longer a question of how,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.120
but of when.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.496
Using synthetic biology

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.616
to change the genetic makeup
of any living organisms,

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.856
especially our own,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.200
is not without its moral
and ethical quandaries.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.800
Will engineering ourselves
make us less human?

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.216
But then again, what is humanity

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.760
but star stuff
that happens to be conscious?

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.640
Where should human genius direct itself?

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.560
Surely it is a bit of a waste
to sit back and marvel at it.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.136
How do we use our knowledge

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.416
to protect ourselves
from the external dangers

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.080
and then protect ourselves from ourselves?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.816
I pose these questions

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.016
not to engender the fear of science

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.416
but to bring to light
the many possibilities

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.840
that science has afforded
and continues to afford us.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.736
We must coalesce as humans
to discuss and embrace the solutions

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.960
not only with caution

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.600
but also with courage.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.800
Mars is a destination,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.040
but it will not be our last.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.856
Our true final frontier
is the line we must cross

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.600
in deciding what we can and should make
of our species' improbable intelligence.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.120
Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.536
Our path to the stars
will be rife with trials

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.536
that will bring us to question
not only who we are

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.320
but where we will be going.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.736
The answers will lie in our choice
to use or abandon the technology

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.856
that we have gleaned from life itself,

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.736
and it will define us for the remainder
of our term in this universe.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.976
Thank you.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.619
(Applause)
