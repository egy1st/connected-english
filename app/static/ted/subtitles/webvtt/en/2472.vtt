00:00:00.644 --> 00:00:02.478
OK, so, confession:

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:07.103
I've always been weirdly
obsessed with advertising.

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:11.306
I remember watching
Saturday morning cartoons,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.463
paying more attention to the commercials

00:00:13.487 --> 00:00:14.794
than to the shows,

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:17.908
trying to figure out how they were trying
to get inside my head.

00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:20.011
Ultimately, that led me to my dream job.

00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:23.313
I became a partner
at a big New York ad agency.

00:00:23.337 --> 00:00:29.526
But then, all of that suddenly changed
on February 23, 1997,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.898
when my little brother Matt
was shot in the head

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:35.747
in a shooting that happened
on the observation deck

00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:37.887
of the Empire State Building.

00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:43.073
Suddenly, my family was thrown
into the middle of a nightmare,

00:00:43.097 --> 00:00:47.227
being told that my brother
was going to die,

00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.927
actually being given the opportunity
to say goodbye to him,

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:53.301
then several emergency brain surgeries

00:00:53.325 --> 00:00:55.976
and now what's amounted, for Matt,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.246
to a lifetime spent courageously
recovering from a traumatic brain injury.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.284
He is definitely my hero.

00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:07.443
But as much as (Applause) --
yeah, deserves it --

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:12.573
(Applause)

00:01:12.597 --> 00:01:18.200
But as much as this tragedy
was a nightmare for my family,

00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:20.775
I often think about how much worse
it could have been;

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.858
in fact, how much worse
it is for the 90 families every day

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:27.762
who aren't as fortunate,

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:33.994
who lose loved ones -- brothers,
sisters, sons, daughters, parents.

00:01:34.018 --> 00:01:36.519
They don't all make national headlines.

00:01:36.543 --> 00:01:38.185
In fact, most of them don't.

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.281
They go largely unnoticed,

00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:46.904
in a nation that's kind of come to accept
a disgraceful national epidemic

00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:50.326
as some kind of new normal.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.146
So I quit my job in advertising

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.272
to try and do something about
this disgraceful national epidemic,

00:01:58.296 --> 00:01:59.493
because I came to realize

00:01:59.517 --> 00:02:02.630
that the challenges
to preventing gun violence

00:02:02.654 --> 00:02:06.319
are actually the same ones
that made me love advertising,

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:08.826
which is to try to figure out
how to engage people.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.453
Only instead of doing it to sell products,

00:02:11.477 --> 00:02:13.257
doing it to save lives.

00:02:13.726 --> 00:02:18.649
And that comes down to
finding common ground,

00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:22.682
where what I want overlaps
with what you want.

00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:25.912
And you might be surprised to learn,
when it comes to gun violence,

00:02:25.936 --> 00:02:27.983
just how much common ground there is.

00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:30.992
Let's look, for example,
at people who love to hunt,

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:34.198
a sport enjoyed by millions across the US.

00:02:34.222 --> 00:02:36.862
It's a proud tradition. Families.

00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:38.040
In some places,

00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:41.316
the first day of hunting season
is actually a school holiday.

00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:43.261
What do hunters want?

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:45.633
Well, they want to hunt.
They love their guns.

00:02:45.657 --> 00:02:46.857
They believe deeply

00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.373
in the Second Amendment right
to own those guns.

00:02:49.397 --> 00:02:51.676
But that doesn't mean
there isn't common ground.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.128
In fact, there's a lot of it,

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:58.556
starting with the basic idea
of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.394
This isn't about taking
certain guns away from all people.

00:03:03.418 --> 00:03:06.294
It's about keeping all guns
away from certain people,

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:09.783
and it's the people that, it turns out,
we all agree shouldn't have guns:

00:03:09.807 --> 00:03:12.287
convicted violent criminals,
domestic abusers,

00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.181
the dangerously mentally ill.

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:16.356
We can all appreciate

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.287
how Brady background checks
have been incredibly effective

00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:21.579
in keeping guns
out of those dangerous hands.

00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:26.010
In 20 years, Brady background checks
at federally licensed firearm dealers

00:03:26.034 --> 00:03:29.799
have blocked 2.4 million gun sales

00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:32.988
to those people that we all agree
shouldn't have guns.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:37.386
(Applause)

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.607
And whether you love guns or hate guns,
you probably also appreciate

00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:44.807
that there shouldn't be thousands
of gun sales every day

00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:46.677
at guns shows or online

00:03:46.701 --> 00:03:48.560
without those Brady background checks,

00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:51.584
just like there shouldn't be two lines
to get on an airplane --

00:03:51.608 --> 00:03:54.232
one with security
and one with no security.

00:03:54.256 --> 00:03:55.407
And --

00:03:55.431 --> 00:03:58.933
(Applause)

00:03:58.957 --> 00:04:02.720
And the numbers show the overwhelming
agreement among the American public:

00:04:02.744 --> 00:04:07.027
90 percent of Americans support
expanding Brady background checks

00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:09.685
to all gun sales -- including
90 percent of Republicans,

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.629
more than 80 percent of gun owners,

00:04:11.653 --> 00:04:13.905
more than 70 percent of NRA members.

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:15.843
This is not a controversial idea.

00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:19.443
In fact, only six percent
of the American public disagrees.

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:21.832
That's about the percentage
of the American public

00:04:21.856 --> 00:04:24.045
that believes the moon landing was a fake.

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:25.434
(Laughter)

00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:28.430
And it's also about the percentage
that believes the government

00:04:28.454 --> 00:04:32.413
is putting mind-controlling technology
in our TV broadcast signals.

00:04:32.437 --> 00:04:35.264
That's the extent to which we agree
about background checks.

00:04:35.288 --> 00:04:38.836
But what about the 300 million guns

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.256
already out there in homes across America?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.050
Well first, it's important to realize

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:47.412
that those guns are mostly
in the hands and homes

00:04:47.436 --> 00:04:50.376
of decent, law-abiding people
like you and me,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.671
who want what we all want --
including keeping our families safe.

00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:58.680
In fact, that's why more and more people
are choosing to own guns.

00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:03.039
Ten years ago, 42 percent
of the American public

00:05:03.063 --> 00:05:07.340
believed -- incorrectly -- that a gun
makes your home safer.

00:05:07.364 --> 00:05:11.007
Today, that number is 63 percent.

00:05:11.784 --> 00:05:12.936
Why?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.158
I kind of hate to say it,

00:05:14.182 --> 00:05:16.772
because it gets to the dark
underbelly of advertising,

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:19.224
which is if you tell
a big enough lie enough times,

00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:21.089
eventually that lie becomes the truth.

00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:23.060
And that's exactly what's happened here.

00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:25.626
The corporate gun lobby
has spent billions of dollars

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.975
blocking the CDC from doing research
into the public health epidemic

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:30.660
of gun violence;

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:32.844
blocking pediatricians
from talking to parents

00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:34.679
about the dangers of guns in the home;

00:05:34.703 --> 00:05:37.072
blocking smart-gun technology
and other technology

00:05:37.096 --> 00:05:39.767
that would prevent kids
from firing parents' guns

00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:41.354
and would save lives.

00:05:41.812 --> 00:05:44.081
They're desperate to hide the truth,

00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:48.383
because they view the truth
as a threat to their bottom line.

00:05:48.407 --> 00:05:49.568
And every day,

00:05:49.592 --> 00:05:51.187
people are dying as a result.

00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:53.702
And a lot of those people are children.

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:56.445
Every day in the US,

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.658
nine kids are just shot unintentionally.

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:05.452
900 children and teens
take their own lives every year.

00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:09.226
And here's the thing:
they're almost all with a parent's gun.

00:06:09.874 --> 00:06:16.235
Even two-thirds of school shootings
happen with a gun taken from the home,

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.944
including the terrible tragedy

00:06:17.968 --> 00:06:19.244
at Sandy Hook.

00:06:19.562 --> 00:06:21.525
I meet so many of these parents;

00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:23.929
it's the most heartbreaking
part of my job.

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.913
These are not bad people.

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:32.691
They're just living with the unimaginable
consequences of a very bad decision,

00:06:32.715 --> 00:06:35.586
made based on very bad information

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.498
that was put into their minds
by very bad people,

00:06:38.522 --> 00:06:41.727
who know good and well
the misery that they're causing,

00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:44.108
but just don't care.

00:06:44.577 --> 00:06:47.039
And the result is a nightmare --

00:06:47.063 --> 00:06:49.633
not only for families like mine,

00:06:49.657 --> 00:06:53.026
but for, really, at the end
of the day, all of us.

00:06:53.472 --> 00:06:56.386
But I'm not here to talk
about the nightmare of gun violence.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.446
I'm here to talk about our dream,
and it's a dream we all share,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.946
which is the dream
of a better, safer, future.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.672
For my organization,
for the Brady Campaign,

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:07.284
that dream is reflected in the bold goal

00:07:07.308 --> 00:07:12.078
to cut the number of gun deaths
in the US in half by 2025.

00:07:12.102 --> 00:07:14.604
And I hope to leave
all of you here tonight

00:07:14.628 --> 00:07:20.501
with a strong sense of exactly why
that dream is so absolutely within reach.

00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:21.891
Because folks,

00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:24.727
for every great movement around the world,

00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:27.538
there's a moment
where you can look back and say,

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:30.446
"That's when things
really started to change."

00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:32.289
And I'm here to say

00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:35.234
that for the movement
to end gun violence in America,

00:07:35.258 --> 00:07:37.840
that moment is here.

00:07:38.308 --> 00:07:43.969
(Applause)

00:07:43.993 --> 00:07:46.874
We are so clearly at a tipping point,

00:07:46.898 --> 00:07:50.009
because the American public
has come together by the millions

00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:52.247
like never before,
based on that common ground,

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.666
to say, "Enough."

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.897
Enough of the mass shootings
in malls and movie theaters

00:07:56.921 --> 00:07:58.827
and churches and schools.

00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:03.744
Enough of the daily terror
of gun violence in homes and streets

00:08:03.768 --> 00:08:06.975
that's claimed the lives of women
and young black men

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:08.421
in staggering proportions.

00:08:08.445 --> 00:08:10.228
Enough of easy access to guns

00:08:10.252 --> 00:08:12.728
by the people that we all agree
shouldn't have them.

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:15.787
And enough of a small group
of craven politicians

00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:18.100
putting the interests
of the corporate gun lobby

00:08:18.124 --> 00:08:21.123
ahead of the people
they have been elected to represent.

00:08:21.147 --> 00:08:22.298
Enough.

00:08:22.322 --> 00:08:28.476
(Applause)

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.404
And the really exciting thing is,
it's not just the usual suspects like me

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:33.960
that are saying it anymore.

00:08:33.984 --> 00:08:35.888
It's so much bigger than that.

00:08:35.912 --> 00:08:37.063
And if you want proof,

00:08:37.087 --> 00:08:40.639
let's start where most conversations
in the US seem to start --

00:08:40.663 --> 00:08:42.067
with Kim Kardashian.

00:08:42.091 --> 00:08:43.281
(Laughter)

00:08:43.305 --> 00:08:45.424
And here's the thing:
it's not really a joke.

00:08:45.448 --> 00:08:47.321
I mean, think about when issues change.

00:08:47.345 --> 00:08:50.114
It's when they go from being
political and advocacy issues

00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:51.544
to being part of pop culture,

00:08:51.568 --> 00:08:55.137
voices coming from everywhere,
celebrities using their platforms,

00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:56.762
musicians, athletes.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.042
The NBA has come forward.

00:08:58.066 --> 00:09:00.720
Conservative pundits that you never
would have imagined

00:09:00.744 --> 00:09:01.895
have come forward.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:03.461
There's real cultural change --

00:09:03.485 --> 00:09:05.851
I even hear there's a TED Talk
about it this year.

00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:10.420
That's the extent to which
this cultural change is happening.

00:09:10.444 --> 00:09:14.372
And yes, Kim Kardashian has made
an unsolicited passionate appeal

00:09:14.396 --> 00:09:17.510
to her 35 million Twitter followers

00:09:17.534 --> 00:09:19.882
for expanded background checks.

00:09:19.906 --> 00:09:22.821
Let's look at the political elections
that are heating up.

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:25.702
This used to be the classic
third-rail issue for Democrats.

00:09:25.726 --> 00:09:27.440
Couldn't run from it fast enough.

00:09:27.464 --> 00:09:29.147
Now candidates are running on it.

00:09:29.171 --> 00:09:32.138
Some are being forced
to reverse very bad positions

00:09:32.162 --> 00:09:36.384
they defended very comfortably,
until very recently.

00:09:36.408 --> 00:09:38.038
For somebody like me,

00:09:38.062 --> 00:09:43.124
watching people wave around
their negative NRA ratings --

00:09:43.148 --> 00:09:46.367
it's almost surreal to watch.

00:09:46.391 --> 00:09:50.114
We're still outfunded, yes,
by the corporate gun lobby,

00:09:50.138 --> 00:09:52.507
and ultimately that needs to change.

00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:53.692
But you know what?

00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:58.075
We're smarter and we're scrappier,
and we have the truth on our side.

00:09:58.099 --> 00:09:59.819
And we're on offense.

00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:03.253
You know, they say that the Internet
democratizes information.

00:10:03.277 --> 00:10:07.015
Social media and some
of the organizing tools that plug into it

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.912
have democratized activism.

00:10:08.936 --> 00:10:12.303
It's allowed us to show what 90 percent
support really looks like.

00:10:12.327 --> 00:10:13.574
Sometimes I think of it --

00:10:13.598 --> 00:10:16.835
you know, we're converging
and attacking instantly by the millions,

00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:18.462
kind of like white blood cells.

00:10:18.486 --> 00:10:23.045
It's enabled us to start to really
close -- and this is the bottom line --

00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:25.275
close that disgraceful disconnect

00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:27.711
between what the American public wants

00:10:27.735 --> 00:10:29.982
and what our elected leaders
are doing about it.

00:10:30.006 --> 00:10:31.530
Until recently,

00:10:31.554 --> 00:10:34.806
the narrative in Congress
was that calls from the other side,

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.990
from that six percent,

00:10:36.014 --> 00:10:39.194
outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one.

00:10:39.218 --> 00:10:41.257
We're flipping that narrative on its head.

00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:43.891
After that recent terrible tragedy
in San Bernardino,

00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:45.720
we jammed Congressional switchboards.

00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:51.117
We put 15,000 calls
into Congress in 24 hours.

00:10:51.141 --> 00:10:52.292
And you know what?

00:10:52.316 --> 00:10:53.467
We got a vote on a bill

00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:56.705
that nobody thought was going to see
the light of day anytime soon.

00:10:56.729 --> 00:10:59.570
We're seeing real movement
to repeal some of the most evil,

00:10:59.594 --> 00:11:04.233
ugly gun lobby legislation
passed over the last dark decade.

00:11:04.257 --> 00:11:07.164
The stranglehold of the gun lobby
is clearly being broken.

00:11:07.188 --> 00:11:10.490
We've seen President Obama's
historic executive actions.

00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:11.904
They don't go all the way,

00:11:11.928 --> 00:11:13.515
but they are going to save lives,

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:15.586
because they expand
Brady background checks

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.182
to thousands of gun sales
that didn't have them previously.

00:11:19.206 --> 00:11:22.214
And we're marching across the country --
we're not just waiting

00:11:22.238 --> 00:11:25.623
for Congress to act; that would almost
be the definition of insanity.

00:11:25.647 --> 00:11:27.292
We're marching across the country,

00:11:27.316 --> 00:11:29.915
state by state, marriage-equality style.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.513
And you know what? We're winning.

00:11:31.537 --> 00:11:35.204
Congress is almost always
the last to wake up and realize

00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:37.417
that it's on the wrong side of history.

00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:41.062
And when they do, it's always
because the American public shakes them.

00:11:41.086 --> 00:11:43.268
And that's exactly
what we're doing right now,

00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:44.830
as we're in this tipping point.

00:11:44.854 --> 00:11:48.803
You know, recently I was flying
cross-country to give a speech

00:11:48.827 --> 00:11:52.259
to a large group like this,
although far less intimidating,

00:11:52.283 --> 00:11:56.024
and the woman sitting next to me
happened to be binge-watching

00:11:56.048 --> 00:12:00.976
one of my all-time favorite
TV shows, "Mad Men,"

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.214
a period TV show about advertising

00:12:03.238 --> 00:12:05.056
in the 1960s.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.677
And as I was trying to think
about how to end my remarks,

00:12:08.701 --> 00:12:10.976
I'd glance up at her screen
every now and then,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.293
and it seemed that every time I did,

00:12:13.317 --> 00:12:17.642
I'd see somebody smoking
in an office or around children

00:12:17.666 --> 00:12:20.079
or while pregnant or drinking and driving

00:12:20.103 --> 00:12:24.074
or driving without seat belts
or sexually harassing a coworker.

00:12:24.098 --> 00:12:26.472
And ultimately it dawned on me:

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.858
what tremendous inspiration

00:12:27.882 --> 00:12:31.841
to those of us who have this dream
to end gun violence.

00:12:31.865 --> 00:12:34.436
I mean, think about how much
the world has changed

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.239
in a relatively short period of time,

00:12:37.263 --> 00:12:40.896
how all those behaviors that were once
considered commonplace or normal --

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.137
some even glamorous or sexy --

00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:47.268
have become stigmatized
in just a generation or two,

00:12:47.292 --> 00:12:51.316
once they became conversations
about our common ground.

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:56.613
That is the magnitude of the change
we have the potential to create

00:12:56.637 --> 00:12:58.272
around gun violence.

00:12:58.296 --> 00:12:59.860
And that's my dream,

00:12:59.884 --> 00:13:01.352
that maybe someday,

00:13:01.376 --> 00:13:06.871
some period TV show will depict
the terrible nightmare of gun violence,

00:13:06.895 --> 00:13:10.269
and a future generation of children
might only be able to imagine

00:13:10.293 --> 00:13:12.142
how terrible it must have been.

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.317
Thank you.

00:13:13.341 --> 00:13:19.055
(Applause)

00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:20.230
Thank you.

00:13:20.254 --> 00:13:21.747
(Applause)

00:13:21.771 --> 00:13:22.922
Thank you.

00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:25.849
(Applause)
