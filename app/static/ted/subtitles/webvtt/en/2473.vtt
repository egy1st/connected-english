00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.142
So, there's an actor
called Dustin Hoffman.

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:07.619
And years ago, he made this movie
which some of you may have heard of,

00:00:07.643 --> 00:00:08.833
called "The Graduate."

00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:11.874
And there's two key scenes in that movie.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.653
The first one is the seduction scene.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:16.670
I'm not going to talk about that tonight.

00:00:16.694 --> 00:00:18.161
(Laughter)

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:22.775
The second scene is where he's taken out
by the old guy to the pool,

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:27.818
and as a young college graduate,
the old guy basically says one word,

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:29.031
just one word.

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.127
And of course, all of you know
what that word is.

00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:33.341
It's "plastics."

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.531
(Laughter)

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.122
And the only problem with that is,
it was completely the wrong advice.

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:40.633
(Laughter)

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.377
Let me tell you why it was so wrong.

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:45.194
The word should have been "silicon."

00:00:46.163 --> 00:00:48.187
And the reason it should have been silicon

00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:53.392
is because the basic patents
for semiconductors had already been made,

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:54.793
had already been filed,

00:00:54.817 --> 00:00:56.582
and they were already building them.

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:59.693
So Silicon Valley was just
being built in 1967,

00:00:59.717 --> 00:01:01.525
when this movie was released.

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:03.637
And the year after the movie was released,

00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:04.826
Intel was founded.

00:01:05.327 --> 00:01:08.153
So had the graduate heard
the right one word,

00:01:08.177 --> 00:01:11.709
maybe he would have ended up
onstage -- oh, I don't know --

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:12.891
maybe with these two.

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:15.794
(Laughter)

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:21.666
So as you're thinking of that,

00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:26.064
let's see what bit of advice
we might want to give

00:01:26.088 --> 00:01:29.678
so that your next graduate doesn't become
a Tupperware salesman.

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:31.582
(Laughter)

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:35.351
So in 2015, what word of advice
would you give people,

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:38.016
when you took a college
graduate out by the pool

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.930
and you said one word, just one word?

00:01:40.698 --> 00:01:42.698
I think the answer would be "lifecode."

00:01:43.312 --> 00:01:44.471
So what is "lifecode?"

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:47.232
Lifecode is the various ways
we have of programming life.

00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:49.091
So instead of programming computers,

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:51.788
we're using things to program viruses

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:53.836
or retroviruses or proteins

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.668
or DNA or RNA

00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:59.144
or plants or animals,
or a whole series of creatures.

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:02.162
And as you're thinking
about this incredible ability

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:04.439
to make life do what you want it to do,

00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:06.580
what it's programmed to do,

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:08.397
what you end up doing

00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:11.866
is taking what we've been doing
for thousands of years,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.011
which is breeding, changing,

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.106
mixing, matching

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.139
all kinds of life-forms,

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:20.624
and we accelerate it.

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:22.148
And this is not something new.

00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:24.472
This humble mustard weed has been modified

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.168
so that if you change it in one way,
you get broccoli.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.240
And if you change it
in a second way, you get kale.

00:02:31.764 --> 00:02:33.780
And if you change it in a third way,

00:02:33.804 --> 00:02:35.073
you get cauliflower.

00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:39.014
So when you go to these
all-natural, organic markets,

00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:40.618
you're really going to a place

00:02:40.642 --> 00:02:44.601
where people have been changing
the lifecode of plants for a long time.

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:46.628
The difference today,

00:02:46.652 --> 00:02:48.897
to pick a completely
politically neutral term --

00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:50.612
[Intelligent design]

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:51.793
(Laughter)

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:54.223
We're beginning to practice
intelligent design.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.057
That means that instead
of doing this at random

00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:59.137
and seeing what happens over generations,

00:02:59.161 --> 00:03:02.847
we're inserting specific genes,
we're inserting specific proteins,

00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:06.078
and we're changing lifecode
for very deliberate purposes.

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:09.839
And that allows us to accelerate
how this stuff happens.

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:12.211
Let me just give you one example.

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:17.823
Some of you occasionally
might think about sex.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.528
And we kind of take it for granted
how we've changed sex.

00:03:22.552 --> 00:03:25.460
So we think it's perfectly normal
and natural to change it.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.299
What's happened with sex over time is --

00:03:28.323 --> 00:03:31.011
normally, sex equals baby, eventually.

00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:33.481
But in today's world,

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:36.384
sex plus pill equals no baby.

00:03:36.408 --> 00:03:37.892
(Laughter)

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:40.654
And again, we think
that's perfectly normal and natural,

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:43.528
but that has not been the case
for most of human history.

00:03:43.552 --> 00:03:45.203
And it's not the case for animals.

00:03:45.608 --> 00:03:47.590
What it is does is it gives us control,

00:03:47.614 --> 00:03:50.053
so sex becomes separate from conception.

00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:53.400
And as you're thinking
of the consequences of that,

00:03:53.424 --> 00:03:55.088
then we've been playing with stuff

00:03:55.112 --> 00:03:57.423
that's a little bit more
advanced, like art.

00:03:57.447 --> 00:03:59.525
Not in the sense
of painting and sculpture,

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.226
but in the sense of assisted
reproductive technologies.

00:04:05.405 --> 00:04:07.841
So what are assisted
reproductive technologies?

00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:11.583
Assisted reproductive technologies
are things like in vitro fertilization.

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:15.838
And when you do in vitro fertilization,
there's very good reasons to do it.

00:04:15.862 --> 00:04:18.982
Sometimes you just
can't conceive otherwise.

00:04:19.622 --> 00:04:20.777
But when you do that,

00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:24.863
what you’re doing is separating
sex, conception, baby.

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:28.690
So you haven't just taken control
of when you have a baby,

00:04:28.714 --> 00:04:32.038
you've separated when the baby
and where the baby is fertilized.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.922
So you've separated the baby

00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:36.651
from the body from the act.

00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:40.412
And as you're thinking
of other things we've been doing,

00:04:40.436 --> 00:04:42.294
think about twins.

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:45.149
So you can freeze sperm,
you can freeze eggs,

00:04:45.173 --> 00:04:46.870
you can freeze fertilized eggs.

00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:49.543
And what does that mean?

00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:52.061
Well, that's a good thing
if you're a cancer patient.

00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:55.089
You're about to go under chemotherapy
or under radiation,

00:04:55.113 --> 00:04:56.343
so you save these things.

00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:57.604
You don't irradiate them.

00:04:58.072 --> 00:05:00.398
But if you can save them
and you can freeze them,

00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:02.524
and you can have a surrogate mother,

00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:04.707
it means that you've
decoupled sex from time.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.628
It means you can have twins
born -- oh, in 50 years?

00:05:11.287 --> 00:05:14.976
(Laughter)

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.257
In a hundred years?

00:05:17.342 --> 00:05:18.630
Two hundred years?

00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:22.353
And these are three
really profound changes

00:05:22.377 --> 00:05:23.976
that are not, like, future stuff.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.117
This is stuff we take for granted today.

00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:29.840
So this lifecode stuff
turns out to be a superpower.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.856
It turns out to be this incredibly
powerful way of changing viruses,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.064
of changing plants, of changing animals,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.094
perhaps even of evolving ourselves.

00:05:40.118 --> 00:05:43.860
It's something that Steve Gullans and I
have been thinking about for a while.

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:45.908
Let's have some risks.

00:05:46.408 --> 00:05:50.552
Like every powerful technology,
like electricity, like an automobile,

00:05:50.576 --> 00:05:53.885
like computers, this stuff
potentially can be misused.

00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:56.202
And that scares a lot of people.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.785
And as you apply these technologies,

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:01.061
you can even turn human
beings into chimeras.

00:06:01.815 --> 00:06:04.354
Remember the Greek myth
where you mix animals?

00:06:04.378 --> 00:06:06.036
Well, some of these treatments

00:06:06.388 --> 00:06:08.634
actually end up changing your blood type.

00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:13.585
Or they'll put male cells
in a female body or vice versa,

00:06:14.326 --> 00:06:15.914
which sounds absolutely horrible

00:06:15.938 --> 00:06:18.215
until you realize, the reason
you're doing that

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:21.644
is you're substituting bone marrow
during cancer treatments.

00:06:21.668 --> 00:06:23.916
So by taking somebody else's bone marrow,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.632
you may be changing
some fundamental aspects of yourself,

00:06:26.656 --> 00:06:28.544
but you're also saving your life.

00:06:28.568 --> 00:06:30.714
And as you're thinking about this stuff,

00:06:30.738 --> 00:06:32.908
here's something
that happened 20 years ago.

00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:34.862
This is Emma Ott.

00:06:34.886 --> 00:06:37.695
She's a recent college admittee.

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:39.624
She's studying accounting.

00:06:39.648 --> 00:06:43.012
She played two varsity sports.
She graduated as a valedictorian.

00:06:43.687 --> 00:06:45.707
And that's not particularly extraordinary,

00:06:45.731 --> 00:06:49.302
except that she's the first human being
born to three parents.

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:51.395
Why?

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.585
Because she had a deadly
mitochondrial disease

00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:55.094
that she might have inherited.

00:06:55.118 --> 00:06:57.499
So when you swap out a third person's DNA

00:06:57.523 --> 00:06:59.251
and you put it in there,

00:06:59.275 --> 00:07:00.832
you save the lives of people.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.221
But you also are doing
germline engineering,

00:07:04.245 --> 00:07:08.388
which means her kids,
if she has kids, will be saved

00:07:08.412 --> 00:07:09.822
and won't go through this.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.337
And [their] kids will be saved,

00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:13.196
and their grandchildren will be saved,

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.417
and this passes on.

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:16.554
That makes people nervous.

00:07:16.578 --> 00:07:18.928
So 20 years ago,
the various authorities said,

00:07:18.952 --> 00:07:20.871
why don't we study this for a while?

00:07:21.903 --> 00:07:25.717
There are risks to doing stuff,
and there are risks to not doing stuff,

00:07:25.741 --> 00:07:29.089
because there were a couple dozen people
saved by this technology,

00:07:29.113 --> 00:07:32.097
and then we've been thinking about it
for the next 20 years.

00:07:33.002 --> 00:07:34.185
So as we think about it,

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:38.019
as we take the time to say, "Hey,
maybe we should have longer studies,

00:07:38.043 --> 00:07:40.444
maybe we should do this,
maybe we should do that,"

00:07:40.468 --> 00:07:44.277
there are consequences to acting,
and there are consequences to not acting.

00:07:45.203 --> 00:07:46.896
Like curing deadly diseases --

00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:49.926
which, by the way,
is completely unnatural.

00:07:50.997 --> 00:07:54.079
It is normal and natural
for humans to be felled

00:07:54.103 --> 00:07:58.172
by massive epidemics of polio,
of smallpox, of tuberculosis.

00:07:58.196 --> 00:08:01.839
When we put vaccines into people,
we are putting unnatural things

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:03.229
into their body

00:08:03.253 --> 00:08:07.362
because we think the benefit
outweighs the risk.

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:11.842
Because we've built unnatural plants,
unnatural animals,

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:14.039
we can feed about seven billion people.

00:08:14.413 --> 00:08:17.585
We can do things
like create new life-forms.

00:08:18.302 --> 00:08:21.819
And as you create new life-forms,
again, that sounds terribly scary

00:08:21.843 --> 00:08:23.524
and terribly bothersome,

00:08:23.548 --> 00:08:26.992
until you realize that those life-forms
live on your dining room table.

00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:30.036
Those flowers you've got
on your dining room table --

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.229
there's not a lot
that's natural about them,

00:08:32.253 --> 00:08:35.345
because people have been breeding
the flowers to make this color,

00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:37.129
to be this size, to last for a week.

00:08:37.153 --> 00:08:39.542
You don't usually give
your loved one wildflowers

00:08:39.566 --> 00:08:42.533
because they don't last
a whole lot of time.

00:08:44.532 --> 00:08:45.770
What all this does

00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:48.596
is it flips Darwin completely on his head.

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:50.900
See, for four billion years,

00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:53.989
what lived and died on this planet
depended on two principles:

00:08:54.608 --> 00:08:57.132
on natural selection and random mutation.

00:08:58.016 --> 00:09:00.643
And so what lived and died,
what was structured,

00:09:01.167 --> 00:09:02.850
has now been flipped on its head.

00:09:04.262 --> 00:09:05.461
And what we've done

00:09:05.485 --> 00:09:08.096
is created this completely
parallel evolutionary system

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.449
where we are practicing unnatural
selection and non-random mutation.

00:09:11.473 --> 00:09:13.168
So let me explain these things.

00:09:13.192 --> 00:09:14.581
This is natural selection.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.495
This is unnatural selection.

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:19.141
(Laughter)

00:09:19.903 --> 00:09:22.547
So what happens with this stuff is,

00:09:22.571 --> 00:09:25.285
we started breeding wolves
thousands of years ago

00:09:25.309 --> 00:09:27.499
in central Asia to turn them into dogs.

00:09:27.523 --> 00:09:29.817
And then we started
turning them into big dogs

00:09:29.841 --> 00:09:31.592
and into little dogs.

00:09:31.616 --> 00:09:33.403
But if you take one of the chihuahuas

00:09:33.427 --> 00:09:36.275
you see in the Hermès bags on Fifth Avenue

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:38.956
and you let it loose on the African plain,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.964
you can watch natural selection happen.

00:09:40.988 --> 00:09:43.669
(Laughter)

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:49.236
Few things on Earth
are less natural than a cornfield.

00:09:50.188 --> 00:09:53.761
You will never, under any scenario,
walk through a virgin forest

00:09:53.785 --> 00:09:56.470
and see the same plant
growing in orderly rows

00:09:56.494 --> 00:09:57.818
at the same time,

00:09:57.842 --> 00:09:59.453
nothing else living there.

00:10:00.398 --> 00:10:01.557
When you do a cornfield,

00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:03.628
you're selecting what lives and what dies.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.419
And you're doing that
through unnatural selection.

00:10:06.443 --> 00:10:09.580
It's the same with a wheat field,
it's the same with a rice field.

00:10:09.604 --> 00:10:12.219
It's the same with a city,
it's the same with a suburb.

00:10:12.243 --> 00:10:14.138
In fact, half the surface of Earth

00:10:14.162 --> 00:10:15.669
has been unnaturally engineered

00:10:15.693 --> 00:10:18.876
so that what lives and what dies
there is what we want,

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.363
which is the reason why
you don't have grizzly bears

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.314
walking through downtown Manhattan.

00:10:25.077 --> 00:10:26.936
How about this random mutation stuff?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.403
Well, this is random mutation.

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:29.767
This is Antonio Alfonseca.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.061
He's otherwise known
as the Octopus, his nickname.

00:10:33.085 --> 00:10:35.359
He was the Relief Pitcher
of the Year in 2000.

00:10:35.955 --> 00:10:38.719
And he had a random mutation
that gave him six fingers

00:10:38.743 --> 00:10:40.971
on each hand,

00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:43.637
which turns out to be really useful
if you're a pitcher.

00:10:43.661 --> 00:10:45.301
(Laughter)

00:10:46.119 --> 00:10:47.849
How about non-random mutation?

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:51.388
A non-random mutation is beer.

00:10:51.412 --> 00:10:53.110
It's wine. It's yogurt.

00:10:53.928 --> 00:10:56.264
How many times have you walked
through the forest

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:57.851
and found all-natural cheese?

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:00.102
Or all-natural yogurt?

00:11:01.046 --> 00:11:02.831
So we've been engineering this stuff.

00:11:02.855 --> 00:11:04.323
Now, the interesting thing is,

00:11:04.347 --> 00:11:05.965
we get to know the stuff better.

00:11:06.364 --> 00:11:10.077
We found one of the single most powerful
gene-editing instruments,

00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:11.888
CRISPR, inside yogurt.

00:11:13.028 --> 00:11:15.018
And as we start engineering cells,

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:19.322
we're producing eight out of the top 10
pharmaceutical products,

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:22.771
including the stuff that you use
to treat arthritis,

00:11:22.795 --> 00:11:25.221
which is the number one
best-selling drug, Humira.

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:27.436
So this lifecode stuff.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.605
It really is a superpower.

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:32.070
It really is a way of programming stuff,

00:11:32.094 --> 00:11:34.651
and there's nothing
that's going to change us

00:11:34.675 --> 00:11:36.801
more than this lifecode.

00:11:37.597 --> 00:11:39.578
So as you're thinking of lifecode,

00:11:39.602 --> 00:11:41.291
let's think of five principles

00:11:42.231 --> 00:11:44.086
as to how we start guiding,

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.729
and I'd love you to give me more.

00:11:46.315 --> 00:11:47.817
So, principle number one:

00:11:48.282 --> 00:11:50.425
we have to take responsibility
for this stuff.

00:11:51.042 --> 00:11:53.593
The reason we have to take responsibility

00:11:53.617 --> 00:11:54.978
is because we're in charge.

00:11:55.002 --> 00:11:56.915
These aren't random mutations.

00:11:56.939 --> 00:11:59.242
This is what we are doing,
what we are choosing.

00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:00.965
It's not, "Stuff happened."

00:12:00.989 --> 00:12:02.462
It didn't happen at random.

00:12:02.486 --> 00:12:05.090
It didn't come down
by a verdict of somebody else.

00:12:05.114 --> 00:12:06.931
We engineer this stuff,

00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:10.200
and it's the Pottery Barn rule:
you break it, you own it.

00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:12.491
Principle number two:

00:12:12.515 --> 00:12:15.643
we have to recognize and celebrate
diversity in this stuff.

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:18.801
There have been at least
33 versions of hominids

00:12:18.825 --> 00:12:20.547
that have walked around this Earth.

00:12:20.912 --> 00:12:23.218
Most all of them went extinct except us.

00:12:23.804 --> 00:12:25.965
But the normal and natural
state of this Earth

00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:29.376
is we have various versions of humans
walking around at the same time,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.057
which is why most of us
have some Neanderthal in us.

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:34.999
Some of us have some Denisova in us.

00:12:35.023 --> 00:12:37.372
And some in Washington
have a lot more of it.

00:12:37.396 --> 00:12:39.974
(Laughter)

00:12:39.998 --> 00:12:41.883
Principle number three:

00:12:41.907 --> 00:12:44.072
we have to respect other people's choices.

00:12:44.608 --> 00:12:46.883
Some people will choose to never alter.

00:12:46.907 --> 00:12:48.717
Some people will choose to alter all.

00:12:48.741 --> 00:12:51.367
Some people will choose
to alter plants but not animals.

00:12:51.391 --> 00:12:53.442
Some people will choose
to alter themselves.

00:12:53.466 --> 00:12:55.729
Some people will choose
to evolve themselves.

00:12:55.753 --> 00:12:57.322
Diversity is not a bad thing,

00:12:57.346 --> 00:12:59.988
because even though we think
of humans as very diverse,

00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:02.297
we came so close to extinction

00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:04.936
that all of us descend
from a single African mother

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.285
and the consequence of that

00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:10.814
is there's more genetic diversity
in 55 African chimpanzees

00:13:10.838 --> 00:13:12.713
than there are in seven billion humans.

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:16.256
Principle number four:

00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:19.079
we should take about
a quarter of the Earth

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.060
and only let Darwin run the show there.

00:13:22.981 --> 00:13:24.582
It doesn't have to be contiguous,

00:13:24.606 --> 00:13:26.380
doesn't have to all be tied together.

00:13:26.404 --> 00:13:28.610
It should be part
in the oceans, part on land.

00:13:28.634 --> 00:13:32.017
But we should not run every
evolutionary decision on this planet.

00:13:32.474 --> 00:13:34.912
We want to have
our evolutionary system running.

00:13:34.936 --> 00:13:37.513
We want to have Darwin's
evolutionary system running.

00:13:37.537 --> 00:13:41.213
And it's just really important to have
these two things running in parallel

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.754
and not overwhelm evolution.

00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:46.888
(Applause)

00:13:50.307 --> 00:13:51.701
Last thing I'll say.

00:13:52.654 --> 00:13:55.916
This is the single most exciting
adventure human beings have been on.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.981
This is the single greatest superpower
humans have ever had.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.873
It would be a crime for you
not to participate in this stuff

00:14:01.897 --> 00:14:03.309
because you're scared of it,

00:14:03.333 --> 00:14:05.072
because you're hiding from it.

00:14:05.096 --> 00:14:08.467
You can participate in the ethics.
You can participate in the politics.

00:14:08.491 --> 00:14:10.240
You can participate in the business.

00:14:10.264 --> 00:14:13.422
You can participate in just thinking
about where medicine is going,

00:14:13.446 --> 00:14:14.607
where industry is going,

00:14:14.631 --> 00:14:16.434
where we're going to take the world.

00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:18.323
It would be a crime for all of us

00:14:18.347 --> 00:14:22.405
not to be aware when somebody
shows up at a swimming pool

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:25.008
and says one word, just one word,

00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:27.898
if you don't listen
if that word is "lifecode."

00:14:27.922 --> 00:14:29.200
Thank you very much.

00:14:29.224 --> 00:14:36.437
(Applause)
