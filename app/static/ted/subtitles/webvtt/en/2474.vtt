00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.536
Seven years ago, a student came to me
and asked me to invest in his company.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.536
He said, "I'm working with three friends,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.000
and we're going to try to disrupt
an industry by selling stuff online."

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.696
And I said, "OK, you guys spent
the whole summer on this, right?"

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.856
"No, we all took internships
just in case it doesn't work out."

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.040
"All right, but you're going to
go in full time once you graduate."

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.720
"Not exactly. We've all
lined up backup jobs."

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.856
Six months go by,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.856
it's the day before the company launches,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.000
and there is still
not a functioning website.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.816
"You guys realize,
the entire company is a website.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.200
That's literally all it is."

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.440
So I obviously declined to invest.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.896
And they ended up
naming the company Warby Parker.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.536
(Laughter)

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.320
They sell glasses online.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.696
They were recently recognized
as the world's most innovative company

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.736
and valued at over a billion dollars.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.080
And now? My wife handles our investments.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.520
Why was I so wrong?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.680
To find out, I've been studying people
that I come to call "originals."

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.016
Originals are nonconformists,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.456
people who not only have new ideas

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.320
but take action to champion them.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.456
They are people
who stand out and speak up.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.416
Originals drive creativity
and change in the world.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.576
They're the people you want to bet on.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.000
And they look nothing like I expected.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.176
I want to show you today
three things I've learned

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.216
about recognizing originals

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.640
and becoming a little bit more like them.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.776
So the first reason
that I passed on Warby Parker

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.560
was they were really slow
getting off the ground.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.360
Now, you are all intimately familiar
with the mind of a procrastinator.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.600
Well, I have a confession for you.
I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.456
Yes, that's an actual term.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.416
You know that panic you feel
a few hours before a big deadline

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.360
when you haven't done anything yet.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.096
I just feel that
a few months ahead of time.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.160
(Laughter)

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.576
So this started early: when I was a kid,
I took Nintendo games very seriously.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.616
I would wake up at 5am,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.440
start playing and not stop
until I had mastered them.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.816
Eventually it got so out of hand
that a local newspaper came

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.816
and did a story on the dark side
of Nintendo, starring me.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.696
(Laughter)

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.480
(Applause)

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.416
Since then, I have traded hair for teeth.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.080
(Laughter)

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.016
But this served me well in college,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.880
because I finished my senior thesis
four months before the deadline.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.816
And I was proud of that,
until a few years ago.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.856
I had a student named Jihae,
who came to me and said,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.760
"I have my most creative ideas
when I'm procrastinating."

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.576
And I was like, "That's cute,
where are the four papers you owe me?"

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.696
(Laughter)

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.896
No, she was one
of our most creative students,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.176
and as an organizational psychologist,
this is the kind of idea that I test.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.216
So I challenged her to get some data.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.936
She goes into a bunch of companies.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.376
She has people fill out surveys
about how often they procrastinate.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.016
Then she gets their bosses to rate
how creative and innovative they are.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.896
And sure enough,
the precrastinators like me,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.856
who rush in and do everything early

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.616
are rated as less creative

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.600
than people who procrastinate moderately.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.656
So I want to know what happens
to the chronic procrastinators.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.576
She was like, "I don't know.
They didn't fill out my survey."

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.096
(Laughter)

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.080
No, here are our results.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.816
You actually do see that the people
who wait until the last minute

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.560
are so busy goofing off
that they don't have any new ideas.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.896
And on the flip side,
the people who race in

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.840
are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they
don't have original thoughts either.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.720
There's a sweet spot
where originals seem to live.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.080
Why is this?

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.416
Maybe original people
just have bad work habits.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.560
Maybe procrastinating
does not cause creativity.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.416
To find out, we designed some experiments.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.255
We asked people
to generate new business ideas,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.976
and then we get independent readers

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.176
to evaluate how creative
and useful they are.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.616
And some of them are asked
to do the task right away.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.176
Others we randomly assign
to procrastinate

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200
by dangling Minesweeper in front of them

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.896
for either five or 10 minutes.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.056
And sure enough,
the moderate procrastinators

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.760
are 16 percent more creative
than the other two groups.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.776
Now, Minesweeper is awesome,
but it's not the driver of the effect,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.976
because if you play the game first
before you learn about the task,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.656
there's no creativity boost.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.216
It's only when you're told that you're
going to be working on this problem,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.936
and then you start procrastinating,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.496
but the task is still active
in the back of your mind,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.016
that you start to incubate.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.616
Procrastination gives you time
to consider divergent ideas,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.760
to think in nonlinear ways,
to make unexpected leaps.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.936
So just as we were finishing
these experiments,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.456
I was starting to write
a book about originals,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.016
and I thought, "This is the perfect time
to teach myself to procrastinate,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.120
while writing a chapter
on procrastination."

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.120
So I metaprocrastinated,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.496
and like any self-respecting
precrastinator,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.096
I woke up early the next morning

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.936
and I made a to-do list
with steps on how to procrastinate.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.480
(Laughter)

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.056
And then I worked diligently

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.720
toward my goal of not making
progress toward my goal.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.336
I started writing
the procrastination chapter,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.256
and one day -- I was halfway through --

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.176
I literally put it away in mid-sentence

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.536
for months.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.560
It was agony.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.600
But when I came back to it,
I had all sorts of new ideas.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.896
As Aaron Sorkin put it,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.880
"You call it procrastinating.
I call it thinking."

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.656
And along the way I discovered

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.960
that a lot of great originals
in history were procrastinators.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.456
Take Leonardo da Vinci.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.016
He toiled on and off for 16 years

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.816
on the Mona Lisa.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.256
He felt like a failure.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.080
He wrote as much in his journal.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.816
But some of the diversions
he took in optics

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.816
transformed the way that he modeled light

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.760
and made him into a much better painter.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.520
What about Martin Luther King, Jr.?

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.736
The night before
the biggest speech of his life,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.016
the March on Washington,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.160
he was up past 3am, rewriting it.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.216
He's sitting in the audience
waiting for his turn to go onstage,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.040
and he is still scribbling notes
and crossing out lines.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.816
When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.776
he leaves his prepared remarks

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.936
to utter four words
that changed the course of history:

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.240
"I have a dream."

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.160
That was not in the script.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.736
By delaying the task of finalizing
the speech until the very last minute,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.496
he left himself open
to the widest range of possible ideas.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.776
And because the text wasn't set in stone,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.840
he had freedom to improvise.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.816
Procrastinating is a vice
when it comes to productivity,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.680
but it can be a virtue for creativity.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.416
What you see with a lot of great originals

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.056
is that they are quick to start
but they're slow to finish.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.160
And this is what I missed
with Warby Parker.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.376
When they were dragging
their heels for six months,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.016
I looked at them and said,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.496
"You know, a lot of other companies
are starting to sell glasses online."

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.360
They missed the first-mover advantage.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.136
But what I didn't realize was
they were spending all that time

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.016
trying to figure out how to get people

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.040
to be comfortable ordering glasses online.

00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:44.056
And it turns out the first-mover
advantage is mostly a myth.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.896
Look at a classic study
of over 50 product categories,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.416
comparing the first movers
who created the market

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.880
with the improvers who introduced
something different and better.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.896
What you see is that the first movers
had a failure rate of 47 percent,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.200
compared with only 8 percent
for the improvers.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.536
Look at Facebook,
waiting to build a social network

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.016
until after Myspace and Friendster.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.816
Look at Google, waiting for years
after Altavista and Yahoo.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.936
It's much easier to improve
on somebody else's idea

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.200
than it is to create
something new from scratch.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.976
So the lesson I learned is that
to be original you don't have to be first.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.200
You just have to be different and better.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.336
But that wasn't the only reason
I passed on Warby Parker.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.776
They were also full of doubts.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.616
They had backup plans lined up,

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.056
and that made me doubt
that they had the courage to be original,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.760
because I expected that originals
would look something like this.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.360
(Laughter)

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.296
Now, on the surface,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.296
a lot of original people look confident,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.576
but behind the scenes,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.616
they feel the same fear and doubt
that the rest of us do.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.200
They just manage it differently.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.576
Let me show you: this is a depiction

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.920
of how the creative process
works for most of us.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.120
(Laughter)

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.616
Now, in my research, I discovered
there are two different kinds of doubt.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.296
There's self-doubt and idea doubt.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.856
Self-doubt is paralyzing.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.496
It leads you to freeze.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.256
But idea doubt is energizing.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.056
It motivates you to test,
to experiment, to refine,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.136
just like MLK did.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.416
And so the key to being original

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.176
is just a simple thing

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.576
of avoiding the leap
from step three to step four.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.416
Instead of saying, "I'm crap,"

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.920
you say, "The first few drafts
are always crap,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.080
and I'm just not there yet."

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.536
So how do you get there?

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.456
Well, there's a clue, it turns out,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.440
in the Internet browser that you use.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.616
We can predict your job performance
and your commitment

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.480
just by knowing what web browser you use.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.616
Now, some of you are not
going to like the results of this study --

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.976
(Laughter)

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.936
But there is good evidence
that Firefox and Chrome users

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.320
significantly outperform
Internet Explorer and Safari users.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.296
Yes.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.176
(Applause)

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.160
They also stay in their jobs
15 percent longer, by the way.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.296
Why? It's not a technical advantage.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.696
The four browser groups
on average have similar typing speed

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.856
and they also have similar levels
of computer knowledge.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.976
It's about how you got the browser.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.456
Because if you use
Internet Explorer or Safari,

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.016
those came preinstalled on your computer,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.840
and you accepted the default option
that was handed to you.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.616
If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,
you had to doubt the default

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.896
and ask, is there
a different option out there,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.880
and then be a little resourceful
and download a new browser.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.096
So people hear about this study
and they're like,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.816
"Great, if I want to get better at my job,
I just need to upgrade my browser?"

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.856
(Laughter)

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.976
No, it's about being the kind of person

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.416
who takes the initiative
to doubt the default

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.576
and look for a better option.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.096
And if you do that well,

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.920
you will open yourself up
to the opposite of déjà vu.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.736
There's a name for it.
It's called vuja de.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.760
(Laughter)

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.976
Vuja de is when you look at something
you've seen many times before

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.760
and all of a sudden
see it with fresh eyes.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.536
It's a screenwriter
who looks at a movie script

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.536
that can't get the green light
for more than half a century.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.760
In every past version,
the main character has been an evil queen.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.416
But Jennifer Lee starts to question
whether that makes sense.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.896
She rewrites the first act,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.536
reinvents the villain as a tortured hero

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.520
and Frozen becomes
the most successful animated movie ever.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.696
So there's a simple message
from this story.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.320
When you feel doubt, don't let it go.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.960
(Laughter)

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.976
What about fear?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.920
Originals feel fear, too.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.456
They're afraid of failing,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.576
but what sets them apart
from the rest of us

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.216
is that they're even more
afraid of failing to try.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.336
They know you can fail
by starting a business that goes bankrupt

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.800
or by failing to start a business at all.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.016
They know that in the long run,
our biggest regrets are not our actions

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.696
but our inactions.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.578
The things we wish we could redo,
if you look at the science,

00:12:06.602 --> 00:12:08.802
are the chances not taken.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.376
Elon Musk told me recently,
he didn't expect Tesla to succeed.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.136
He was sure the first few SpaceX launches

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.336
would fail to make it to orbit,
let alone get back,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.560
but it was too important not to try.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.896
And for so many of us,
when we have an important idea,

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.160
we don't bother to try.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.016
But I have some good news for you.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.616
You are not going to get judged
on your bad ideas.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.256
A lot of people think they will.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.936
If you look across industries

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.389
and ask people about their biggest idea,
their most important suggestion,

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.720
85 percent of them stayed silent
instead of speaking up.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.656
They were afraid of embarrassing
themselves, of looking stupid.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.096
But guess what? Originals
have lots and lots of bad ideas,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.400
tons of them, in fact.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.560
Take the guy who invented this.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.096
Do you care that he came up
with a talking doll so creepy

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.520
that it scared not only kids
but adults, too?

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.256
No. You celebrate Thomas Edison
for pioneering the light bulb.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.920
(Laughter)

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.096
If you look across fields,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.096
the greatest originals
are the ones who fail the most,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.416
because they're the ones who try the most.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.416
Take classical composers,
the best of the best.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.576
Why do some of them get more pages
in encyclopedias than others

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.976
and also have their compositions
rerecorded more times?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.296
One of the best predictors

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.120
is the sheer volume
of compositions that they generate.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.336
The more output you churn out,
the more variety you get

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.096
and the better your chances
of stumbling on something truly original.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.456
Even the three icons of classical music --
Bach, Beethoven, Mozart --

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.496
had to generate hundreds
and hundreds of compositions

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.760
to come up with a much smaller
number of masterpieces.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.376
Now, you may be wondering,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.880
how did this guy become great
without doing a whole lot?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.480
I don't know how Wagner pulled that off.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.376
But for most of us,
if we want to be more original,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.720
we have to generate more ideas.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.136
The Warby Parker founders, when they
were trying to name their company,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.656
they needed something sophisticated,
unique, with no negative associations

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.136
to build a retail brand,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.616
and they tested over 2,000 possibilities

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.296
before they finally put together

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.720
Warby and Parker.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.016
So if you put all this together,
what you see is that originals

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.080
are not that different
from the rest of us.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.856
They feel fear and doubt.
They procrastinate.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.896
They have bad ideas.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.256
And sometimes, it's not in spite
of those qualities but because of them

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.520
that they succeed.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.096
So when you see those things,
don't make the same mistake I did.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.376
Don't write them off.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.376
And when that's you,
don't count yourself out either.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.856
Know that being quick to start
but slow to finish

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.496
can boost your creativity,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.056
that you can motivate yourself
by doubting your ideas

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.656
and embracing the fear of failing to try,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.240
and that you need a lot of bad ideas
in order to get a few good ones.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.336
Look, being original is not easy,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.296
but I have no doubt about this:

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.136
it's the best way
to improve the world around us.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.376
Thank you.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.640
(Applause)
