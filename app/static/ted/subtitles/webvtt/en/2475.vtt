00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.520
I want you to reimagine
how life is organized on earth.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.720
Think of the planet
like a human body that we inhabit.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.816
The skeleton is the transportation system
of roads and railways,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.576
bridges and tunnels, air and seaports

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.816
that enable our mobility
across the continents.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.096
The vascular system that powers the body

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.896
are the oil and gas pipelines
and electricity grids.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.120
that distribute energy.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.696
And the nervous system of communications

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.416
is the Internet cables,
satellites, cellular networks

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.600
and data centers that allow
us to share information.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.856
This ever-expanding infrastructural matrix

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.896
already consists of 64 million
kilometers of roads,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.736
four million kilometers of railways,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.696
two million kilometers of pipelines

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.280
and one million kilometers
of Internet cables.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.720
What about international borders?

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.520
We have less than
500,000 kilometers of borders.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.880
Let's build a better map of the world.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.160
And we can start by overcoming
some ancient mythology.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.160
There's a saying with which
all students of history are familiar:

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.936
"Geography is destiny."

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.440
Sounds so grave, doesn't it?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.800
It's such a fatalistic adage.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.656
It tells us that landlocked countries
are condemned to be poor,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.896
that small countries
cannot escape their larger neighbors,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.840
that vast distances are insurmountable.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.456
But every journey I take around the world,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.920
I see an even greater force
sweeping the planet:

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.160
connectivity.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.816
The global connectivity revolution,
in all of its forms --

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.536
transportation, energy
and communications --

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.816
has enabled such a quantum leap
in the mobility of people,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.576
of goods, of resources, of knowledge,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.160
such that we can no longer even think
of geography as distinct from it.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.936
In fact, I view the two forces
as fusing together

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.040
into what I call "connectography."

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.216
Connectography represents a quantum leap

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.656
in the mobility of people,
resources and ideas,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.480
but it is an evolution,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.456
an evolution of the world
from political geography,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.280
which is how we legally divide the world,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.216
to functional geography,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.816
which is how we actually use the world,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.960
from nations and borders,
to infrastructure and supply chains.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.160
Our global system is evolving

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.896
from the vertically integrated
empires of the 19th century,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.176
through the horizontally interdependent
nations of the 20th century,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.440
into a global network civilization
in the 21st century.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.576
Connectivity, not sovereignty,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.816
has become the organizing principle
of the human species.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.240
(Applause)

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.696
We are becoming
this global network civilization

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.496
because we are literally building it.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.216
All of the world's defense budgets
and military spending taken together

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.336
total just under
two trillion dollars per year.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.736
Meanwhile, our global
infrastructure spending

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.136
is projected to rise
to nine trillion dollars per year

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.696
within the coming decade.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.336
And, well, it should.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.096
We have been living
off an infrastructure stock

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.720
meant for a world population
of three billion,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.736
as our population has crossed
seven billion to eight billion

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.600
and eventually nine billion and more.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.976
As a rule of thumb, we should spend
about one trillion dollars

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.240
on the basic infrastructure needs
of every billion people in the world.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.400
Not surprisingly, Asia is in the lead.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.936
In 2015, China announced the creation

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.000
of the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.056
which together with a network
of other organizations

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.495
aims to construct a network
of iron and silk roads,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.720
stretching from Shanghai to Lisbon.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.816
And as all of this topographical
engineering unfolds,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.296
we will likely spend more
on infrastructure in the next 40 years,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.656
we will build more infrastructure
in the next 40 years,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.440
than we have in the past 4,000 years.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.960
Now let's stop and think
about it for a minute.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.336
Spending so much more on building
the foundations of global society

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.176
rather than on the tools to destroy it

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.776
can have profound consequences.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.856
Connectivity is how
we optimize the distribution

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.456
of people and resources around the world.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.600
It is how mankind comes to be more
than just the sum of its parts.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.440
I believe that is what is happening.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.936
Connectivity has a twin megatrend
in the 21st century:

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.040
planetary urbanization.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.280
Cities are the infrastructures
that most define us.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.056
By 2030, more than two thirds
of the world's population

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.336
will live in cities.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.096
And these are not
mere little dots on the map,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.720
but they are vast archipelagos
stretching hundreds of kilometers.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.936
Here we are in Vancouver,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.816
at the head of the Cascadia Corridor

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.680
that stretches south
across the US border to Seattle.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.936
The technology powerhouse
of Silicon Valley

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.816
begins north of San Francisco
down to San Jose

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.616
and across the bay to Oakland.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.616
The sprawl of Los Angeles
now passes San Diego

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.896
across the Mexican border to Tijuana.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.896
San Diego and Tijuana
now share an airport terminal

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.136
where you can exit into either country.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.400
Eventually, a high-speed rail network
may connect the entire Pacific spine.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.816
America's northeastern megalopolis
begins in Boston through New York

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.616
and Philadelphia to Washington.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.816
It contains more than 50 million people

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.616
and also has plans
for a high-speed rail network.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.560
But Asia is where we really see
the megacities coming together.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.536
This continuous strip of light
from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.736
contains more than 80 million people

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.440
and most of Japan's economy.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.520
It is the world's largest megacity.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.360
For now.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.336
But in China, megacity clusters
are coming together

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.256
with populations
reaching 100 million people.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.176
The Bohai Rim around Beijing,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.456
The Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.376
and the Pearl River Delta,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.736
stretching from Hong Kong
north to Guangzhou.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.096
And in the middle,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.016
the Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.816
whose geographic footprint
is almost the same size

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.480
as the country of Austria.

00:06:51.263 --> 00:06:53.216
And any number of these megacity clusters

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.296
has a GDP approaching
two trillion dollars --

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.000
that's almost the same
as all of India today.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.216
So imagine if our global diplomatic
institutions, such as the G20,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.776
were to base their membership
on economic size

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.800
rather than national representation.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.896
Some Chinese megacities
may be in and have a seat at the table,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.040
while entire countries,
like Argentina or Indonesia would be out.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.776
Moving to India, whose population
will soon exceed that of China,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.096
it too has a number of megacity clusters,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.536
such as the Delhi Capital Region

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.016
and Mumbai.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.256
In the Middle East,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.416
Greater Tehran is absorbing
one third of Iran's population.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.296
Most of Egypt's 80 million people

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.336
live in the corridor
between Cairo and Alexandria.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.376
And in the gulf, a necklace
of city-states is forming,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.856
from Bahrain and Qatar,

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.640
through the United Arab Emirates
to Muscat in Oman.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.000
And then there's Lagos,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.656
Africa's largest city
and Nigeria's commercial hub.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.736
It has plans for a rail network

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.176
that will make it the anchor
of a vast Atlantic coastal corridor,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.256
stretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.736
to Abidjan, the capital
of the Ivory Coast.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.320
But these countries are suburbs of Lagos.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.856
In a megacity world,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.640
countries can be suburbs of cities.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.760
By 2030, we will have as many
as 50 such megacity clusters in the world.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.256
So which map tells you more?

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.416
Our traditional map
of 200 discrete nations

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.336
that hang on most of our walls,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.360
or this map of the 50 megacity clusters?

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.895
And yet, even this is incomplete

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.936
because you cannot understand
any individual megacity

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.120
without understanding
its connections to the others.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.256
People move to cities to be connected,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.480
and connectivity
is why these cities thrive.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.976
Any number of them,
such as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.096
has a GDP approaching or exceeding
one third of one half

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.280
of their entire national GDP.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.896
But equally importantly,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.776
you cannot calculate
any of their individual value

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.456
without understanding
the role of the flows of people,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.176
of finance, of technology

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.880
that enable them to thrive.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.376
Take the Gauteng province of South Africa,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.536
which contains Johannesburg
and the capital Pretoria.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.496
It too represents just over
a third of South Africa's GDP.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.776
But equally importantly,
it is home to the offices

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.776
of almost every single
multinational corporation

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.016
that invests directly into South Africa

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.520
and indeed, into the entire
African continent.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.376
Cities want to be part
of global value chains.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.976
They want to be part
of this global division of labor.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.840
That is how cities think.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.456
I've never met a mayor who said to me,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.040
"I want my city to be cut off."

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.896
They know that their cities belong as much

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.240
to the global network civilization
as to their home countries.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.320
Now, for many people,
urbanization causes great dismay.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.120
They think cities are wrecking the planet.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.176
But right now,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.456
there are more than 200
intercity learning networks thriving.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.816
That is as many as the number
of intergovernmental organizations

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.056
that we have.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.456
And all of these intercity networks
are devoted to one purpose,

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.176
mankind's number one priority
in the 21st century:

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.280
sustainable urbanization.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.880
Is it working?

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.296
Let's take climate change.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.056
We know that summit after summit
in New York and Paris

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.880
is not going to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.856
But what we can see
is that transferring technology

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.496
and knowledge and policies between cities

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.136
is how we've actually begun to reduce
the carbon intensity of our economies.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.296
Cities are learning from each other.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.776
How to install zero-emissions buildings,

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.936
how to deploy electric
car-sharing systems.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.176
In major Chinese cities,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.256
they're imposing quotas
on the number of cars on the streets.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.536
In many Western cities,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.880
young people don't even
want to drive anymore.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.936
Cities have been part of the problem,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.960
now they are part of the solution.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.480
Inequality is the other great challenge
to achieving sustainable urbanization.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.376
When I travel through megacities
from end to end --

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.496
it takes hours and days --

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.256
I experience the tragedy
of extreme disparity

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.200
within the same geography.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.096
And yet, our global stock
of financial assets

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.576
has never been larger,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.096
approaching 300 trillion dollars.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.520
That's almost four times
the actual GDP of the world.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.976
We have taken on such enormous debts
since the financial crisis,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.160
but have we invested them
in inclusive growth?

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.960
No, not yet.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.616
Only when we build sufficient,
affordable public housing,

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.776
when we invest in robust
transportation networks

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.336
to allow people to connect to each other
both physically and digitally,

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.736
that's when our divided
cities and societies

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.616
will come to feel whole again.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.480
(Applause)

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.736
And that is why infrastructure
has just been included

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.216
in the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.560
because it enables all the others.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.896
Our political and economic leaders

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.016
are learning that connectivity
is not charity,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.240
it's opportunity.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.816
And that's why our financial community
needs to understand

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.840
that connectivity is the most
important asset class of the 21st century.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.960
Now, cities can make the world
more sustainable,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.856
they can make the world more equitable,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.736
I also believe that
connectivity between cities

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.520
can make the world more peaceful.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.416
If we look at regions of the world
with dense relations across borders,

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.216
we see more trade, more investment

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.656
and more stability.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.176
We all know the story
of Europe after World War II,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.776
where industrial integration
kicked off a process

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.360
that gave rise to today's
peaceful European Union.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.616
And you can see that Russia, by the way,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.640
is the least connected of major powers
in the international system.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.016
And that goes a long way
towards explaining the tensions today.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.936
Countries that have
less stake in the system

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.320
also have less to lose in disturbing it.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.616
In North America, the lines
that matter most on the map

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.416
are not the US-Canada border
or the US-Mexico border,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.816
but the dense network of roads
and railways and pipelines

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.696
and electricity grids
and even water canals

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.536
that are forming an integrated
North American union.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.256
North America does not need more walls,
it needs more connections.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.920
(Applause)

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.216
But the real promise of connectivity
is in the postcolonial world.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.576
All of those regions where borders
have historically been the most arbitrary

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.536
and where generations of leaders

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.176
have had hostile relations
with each other.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.576
But now a new group of leaders
has come into power

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.160
and is burying the hatchet.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.936
Let's take Southeast Asia,
where high-speed rail networks

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.256
are planned to connect
Bangkok to Singapore

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.176
and trade corridors
from Vietnam to Myanmar.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.736
Now this region of 600 million people
coordinates its agricultural resources

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.160
and its industrial output.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.376
It is evolving
into what I call a Pax Asiana,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.240
a peace among Southeast Asian nations.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.176
A similar phenomenon
is underway in East Africa,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.576
where a half dozen countries

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.896
are investing in railways
and multimodal corridors

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.056
so that landlocked countries
can get their goods to market.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.656
Now these countries
coordinate their utilities

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.776
and their investment policies.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.600
They, too, are evolving
into a Pax Africana.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.096
One region we know could
especially use this kind of thinking

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.400
is the Middle East.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.456
As Arab states tragically collapse,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.216
what is left behind
but the ancient cities,

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.720
such as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad?

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.136
In fact, the nearly
400 million people of the Arab world

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.256
are almost entirely urbanized.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.176
As societies, as cities,

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.456
they are either water rich or water poor,

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.240
energy rich or energy poor.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.936
And the only way
to correct these mismatches

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.576
is not through more wars and more borders,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.440
but through more connectivity
of pipelines and water canals.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.976
Sadly, this is not yet
the map of the Middle East.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.200
But it should be,

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.800
a connected Pax Arabia,

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.336
internally integrated

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.656
and productively connected
to its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.776
Now, it may not seem like connectivity
is what we want right now

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.840
towards the world's most turbulent region.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.216
But we know from history
that more connectivity is the only way

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.736
to bring about stability in the long run.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.456
Because we know
that in region after region,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.416
connectivity is the new reality.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.576
Cities and countries
are learning to aggregate

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.080
into more peaceful and prosperous wholes.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.080
But the real test is going to be Asia.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.976
Can connectivity overcome
the patterns of rivalry

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.576
among the great powers of the Far East?

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.960
After all, this is where World War III
is supposed to break out.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.056
Since the end of the Cold War,
a quarter century ago,

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.456
at least six major wars
have been predicted for this region.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.080
But none have broken out.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.720
Take China and Taiwan.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.176
In the 1990s, this was everyone's
leading World War III scenario.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.696
But since that time,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.216
the trade and investment volumes
across the straits have become so intense

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.456
that last November,

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.336
leaders from both sides
held a historic summit

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.200
to discuss eventual
peaceful reunification.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.776
And even the election
of a nationalist party in Taiwan

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.576
that's pro-independence earlier this year

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.079
does not undermine
this fundamental dynamic.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:14.256
China and Japan have
an even longer history of rivalry

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.695
and have been deploying
their air forces and navies

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.880
to show their strength in island disputes.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.736
But in recent years,

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.896
Japan has been making
its largest foreign investments in China.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.640
Japanese cars are selling
in record numbers there.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.376
And guess where
the largest number of foreigners

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.520
residing in Japan today comes from?

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.920
You guessed it: China.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.416
China and India have fought a major war

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.496
and have three outstanding
border disputes,

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.976
but today India is the second
largest shareholder

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.416
in the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.696
They're building a trade corridor
stretching from Northeast India

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.640
through Myanmar and Bangladesh
to Southern China.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.176
Their trade volume has grown
from 20 billion dollars a decade ago

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.800
to 80 billion dollars today.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.616
Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan
have fought three wars

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.856
and continue to dispute Kashmir,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.416
but they're also negotiating
a most-favored-nation trade agreement

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.176
and want to complete a pipeline

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.176
stretching from Iran
through Pakistan to India.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.760
And let's talk about Iran.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.080
Wasn't it just two years ago
that war with Iran seemed inevitable?

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.480
Then why is every single major power
rushing to do business there today?

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.816
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.840
I cannot guarantee
that World War III will not break out.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.640
But we can definitely see
why it hasn't happened yet.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.376
Even though Asia is home
to the world's fastest growing militaries,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.976
these same countries
are also investing billions of dollars

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.936
in each other's infrastructure
and supply chains.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.776
They are more interested
in each other's functional geography

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.256
than in their political geography.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:00.336
And that is why their leaders think twice,
step back from the brink,

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.920
and decide to focus on economic ties
over territorial tensions.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.040
So often it seems
like the world is falling apart,

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.696
but building more connectivity

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.840
is how we put Humpty Dumpty
back together again,

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.240
much better than before.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.216
And by wrapping the world

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.696
in such seamless physical
and digital connectivity,

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.896
we evolve towards a world

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.440
in which people can rise
above their geographic constraints.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.096
We are the cells and vessels

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.336
pulsing through these global
connectivity networks.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.016
Everyday, hundreds of millions
of people go online

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.656
and work with people they've never met.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.176
More than one billion people
cross borders every year,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.120
and that's expected to rise
to three billion in the coming decade.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.696
We don't just build connectivity,

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.040
we embody it.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.296
We are the global network civilization,

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.200
and this is our map.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.640
A map of the world in which
geography is no longer destiny.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.600
Instead, the future
has a new and more hopeful motto:

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.360
connectivity is destiny.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.256
Thank you.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:21.509
(Applause)
