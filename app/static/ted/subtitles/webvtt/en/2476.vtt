WEBVTT

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.376
Strap yourselves in,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.376
we're going to Mars.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.496
Not just a few astronauts --

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.656
thousands of people
are going to colonize Mars.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.800
And I am telling you
that they're going to do this soon.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.536
Some of you will end up
working on projects on Mars,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.920
and I guarantee that some
of your children will end up living there.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.136
That probably sounds preposterous,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.040
so I'm going to share with you
how and when that will happen.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.976
But first I want to discuss
the obvious question:

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.479
Why the heck should we do this?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.856
12 years ago,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.696
I gave a TED talk on 10 ways
the world could end suddenly.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.496
We are incredibly vulnerable
to the whims of our own galaxy.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.096
A single, large asteroid
could take us out forever.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.576
To survive we have to reach
beyond the home planet.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.816
Think what a tragedy it would be

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.840
if all that humans have accomplished
were suddenly obliterated.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.736
And there's another reason we should go:

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.696
exploration is in our DNA.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.176
Two million years ago
humans evolved in Africa

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.016
and then slowly but surely
spread out across the entire planet

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.536
by reaching into the wilderness
that was beyond their horizons.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.160
This stuff is inside us.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.520
And they prospered doing that.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.136
Some of the greatest advances
in civilization and technology

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.080
came because we explored.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.536
Yes, we could do a lot of good

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.280
with the money it will take
to establish a thriving colony on Mars.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.440
And yes we should all be taking
far better care of our own home planet.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.080
And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars
the way we've screwed up Earth.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.936
But think for a moment,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.896
what we had when John F. Kennedy
told us we would put a human on the moon.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.320
He excited an entire generation to dream.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.336
Think how inspired we will be
to see a landing on Mars.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.096
Perhaps then we will look back at Earth

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.496
and see that that is
one people instead of many

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.056
and perhaps then
we will look back at Earth,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.496
as we struggle to survive on Mars,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.240
and realize how precious
the home planet is.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.440
So let me tell you about the extraordinary
adventure we're about to undertake.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.296
But first,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.920
a few fascinating facts
about where we're going.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.416
This picture actually represents
the true size of Mars compared to Earth.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.336
Mars is not our sister planet.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.136
It's far less than half
the size of the Earth,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.176
and yet despite the fact
that it's smaller,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.896
the surface area of Mars
that you can stand on

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.856
is equivalent to the surface area
of the Earth that you can stand on,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.200
because the Earth
is mostly covered by water.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.296
The atmosphere on Mars is really thin --

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.896
100 times thinner than on Earth --

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.920
and it's not breathable,
it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.376
It's really cold there.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.376
The average temperature
is minus 81 degrees,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.560
although there is
quite a range of temperature.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.896
A day on Mars is about as long
as a day on Earth,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.840
plus about 39 minutes.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.480
Seasons and years on Mars
are twice as long as they are on Earth.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.656
And for anybody who wants to strap
on some wings and go flying one day,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.496
Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.776
and it's the kind of place

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.600
where you can jump over your car
instead of walk around it.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.776
Now, as you can see,
Mars isn't exactly Earth-like,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.560
but it's by far the most livable
other place in our entire solar system.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.856
Here's the problem.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.056
Mars is a long way away,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.920
a thousand times farther away
from us than our own moon.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.336
The Moon is 250,000 miles away

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.000
and it took Apollo astronauts
three days to get there.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.856
Mars is 250 million miles away

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.136
and it will take us
eight months to get there --

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.440
240 days.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.656
And that's only if we launch
on a very specific day,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.416
at a very specific time,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.416
once every two years,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.616
when Mars and the Earth
are aligned just so,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.560
so the distance that the rocket
would have to travel will be the shortest.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.720
240 days is a long time to spend
trapped with your colleagues in a tin can.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.856
And meanwhile, our track record
of getting to Mars is lousy.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.696
We and the Russians,
the Europeans, the Japanese,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.056
the Chinese and the Indians,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.656
have actually sent 44 rockets there,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.216
and the vast majority of them
have either missed or crashed.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.840
Only about a third of the missions
to Mars have been successful.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.120
And we don't at the moment have
a rocket big enough to get there anyway.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.176
We once had that rocket, the Saturn V.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.816
A couple of Saturn Vs
would have gotten us there.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.296
It was the most magnificent
machine ever built by humans,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.520
and it was the rocket
that took us to the Moon.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.136
But the last Saturn V was used in 1973
to launch the Skylab space station,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.256
and we decided to do
something called the shuttle

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.920
instead of continuing on to Mars
after we landed on the Moon.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.136
The biggest rocket we have now

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
is only half big enough
to get us anything to Mars.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.216
So getting to Mars is not going to be easy

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.400
and that brings up
a really interesting question ...

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.760
how soon will the first humans
actually land here?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.496
Now, some pundits think
if we got there by 2050,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.240
that'd be a pretty good achievement.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.720
These days, NASA seems to be saying
that it can get humans to Mars by 2040.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.480
Maybe they can.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.696
I believe that they can get
human beings into Mars orbit by 2035.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.976
But frankly,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.736
I don't think they're going to bother
in 2035 to send a rocket to Mars,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.736
because we will already be there.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.720
We're going to land on Mars in 2027.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.496
And the reason is

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.576
this man is determined
to make that happen.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.080
His name is Elon Musk,
he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.976
Now, he actually told me
that we would land on Mars by 2025,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.896
but Elon Musk is more
optimistic than I am --

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.416
and that's going a ways --

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.080
so I'm giving him
a couple of years of slack.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.376
Still ...

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.736
you've got to ask yourself,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.640
can this guy really do this
by 2025 or 2027?

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.440
Well, let's put a decade with Elon Musk
into a little perspective.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.680
Where was this 10 years ago?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.616
That's the Tesla electric automobile.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.296
In 2005, a lot of people
in the automobile industry were saying,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.760
we would not have
a decent electric car for 50 years.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.560
And where was that?

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.296
That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.696
lifting six tons of supplies
to the International Space Station.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.936
10 years ago,

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.520
SpaceX had not launched anything,
or fired a rocket to anywhere.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.136
So I think it's a pretty good bet

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.216
that the person who is revolutionizing
the automobile industry

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.456
in less than 10 years

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.296
and the person who created an entire
rocket company in less than 10 years

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.560
will get us to Mars by 2027.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.736
Now, you need to know this:

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.400
governments and robots
no longer control this game.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.416
Private companies are leaping into space

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.880
and they will be happy
to take you to Mars.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.760
And that raises a really big question.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.400
Can we actually live there?

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.856
Now, NASA may not be able
to get us there until 2040,

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.976
or we may get there
a long time before NASA,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.960
but NASA has taken a huge responsibility
in figuring out how we can live on Mars.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.896
Let's look at the problem this way.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.776
Here's what you need to live on Earth:

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.216
food, water, shelter and clothing.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.736
And here's what you need to live on Mars:

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.960
all of the above, plus oxygen.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.256
So let's look at the most
important thing on this list first.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.296
Water is the basis
of all life as we know it,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.896
and it's far too heavy for us to carry
water from the Earth to Mars to live,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.560
so we have to find water
if our life is going to succeed on Mars.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.336
And if you look at Mars,
it looks really dry,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.176
it looks like the entire
planet is a desert.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.216
But it turns out that it's not.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.456
The soil alone on Mars
contains up to 60 percent water.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.416
And a number of orbiters that we still
have flying around Mars have shown us --

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.976
and by the way,
that's a real photograph --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.136
that lots of craters on Mars
have a sheet of water ice in them.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.360
It's not a bad place to start a colony.

00:08:51.855 --> 00:08:56.016
Now, here's a view of a little dig
the Phoenix Lander did in 2008,

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.576
showing that just below
the surface of the soil is ice --

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.856
that white stuff is ice.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.136
In the second picture,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.416
which is four days later
than the first picture,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.480
you can see that
some of it is evaporating.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.416
Orbiters also tell us

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.856
that there are huge amounts
of underground water on Mars

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.936
as well as glaciers.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.216
In fact, if only the water ice
at the poles on Mars melted,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.000
most of the planet
would be under 30 feet of water.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.056
So there's plenty of water there,

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.616
but most of it's ice,
most of it's underground,

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.000
it takes a lot of energy to get it
and a lot of human labor.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.776
This is a device cooked up
at the University of Washington

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.280
back in 1998.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.896
It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.976
And it turns out the Mars atmosphere
is often 100 percent humid.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.376
So this device can extract
all the water that humans will need

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.800
simply from the atmosphere on Mars.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.136
Next we have to worry
about what we will breathe.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.056
Frankly, I was really shocked

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.640
to find out that NASA
has this problem worked out.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.240
This is a scientist at MIT
named Michael Hecht.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.616
And he's developed this machine, Moxie.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.856
I love this thing.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.456
It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.640
that sucks in the Martian atmosphere
and pumps out oxygen.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.256
And you have to remember that CO2 --

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.136
carbon dioxide, which is
96 percent of Mars' atmosphere --

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.960
CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.256
Now, the next big rover
that NASA sends to Mars in 2020

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.496
is going to have one
of these devices aboard,

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.216
and it will be able
to produce enough oxygen

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.936
to keep one person alive indefinitely.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.096
But the secret to this --

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.816
and that's just for testing --

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.136
the secret to this is that this thing
was designed from the get-go

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.800
to be scalable by a factor of 100.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.056
Next, what will we eat?

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.016
Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.896
but we're not going to be able to grow

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.056
more than 15 to 20 percent
of our food there,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.576
at least not until water is running
on the surface of Mars

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.920
and we actually have the probability
and the capability of planting crops.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.936
In the meantime,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.056
most of our food will arrive from Earth,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.280
and it will be dried.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.560
And then we need some shelter.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.736
At first we can use inflatable,
pressurized buildings

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.016
as well as the landers themselves.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.016
But this really only works
during the daytime.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.136
There is too much solar radiation
and too much radiation from cosmic rays.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.336
So we really have to go underground.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.056
Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.056
by and large,
is perfect for making bricks.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.296
And NASA has figured this one out, too.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.176
They're going to throw
some polymer plastic into the bricks,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.976
shove them in a microwave oven,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.256
and then you will be able to build
buildings with really thick walls.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:51.256
Or we may choose to live underground
in caves or in lava tubes,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.560
of which there are plenty.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.560
And finally there's clothing.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.336
On Earth we have miles
of atmosphere piled up on us,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.656
which creates 15 pounds of pressure
on our bodies at all times,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.823
and we're constantly
pushing out against that.

00:12:04.847 --> 00:12:07.767
On Mars there's hardly
any atmospheric pressure.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.616
So Dava Newman,

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.096
a scientist at MIT,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.176
has created this sleek space suit.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.696
It will keep us together,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.960
block radiation and keep us warm.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.056
So let's think about this for a minute.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.080
Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.160
we can do this.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.800
We really can.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.840
But it's still a little complicated
and a little difficult.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.616
So that leads to the next big --

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.216
really big step --

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.056
in living the good life on Mars.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.880
And that's terraforming the planet:

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.456
making it more like Earth,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.320
reengineering an entire planet.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.016
That sounds like a lot of hubris,

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.256
but the truth is

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.160
that the technology to do everything
I'm about to tell you already exists.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.920
First we've got to warm it up.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.096
Mars is incredibly cold
because it has a very thin atmosphere.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.456
The answer lies here, at the south pole
and at the north pole of Mars,

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.736
both of which are covered

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.936
with an incredible amount
of frozen carbon dioxide --

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.416
dry ice.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.776
If we heat it up,

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.376
it sublimes directly into the atmosphere

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.216
and thickens the atmosphere
the same way it does on Earth.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.456
And as we know,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.120
CO2 is an incredibly
potent greenhouse gas.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.776
Now, my favorite way of doing this
is to erect a very, very large solar sail

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.016
and focus it --

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.776
it essentially serves as a mirror --

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.176
and focus it on the south pole
of Mars at first.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.216
As the planet spins, it will heat up
all that dry ice, sublime it,

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.496
and it will go into the atmosphere.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.016
It actually won't take long

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.296
for the temperature
on Mars to start rising,

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.880
probably less than 20 years.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.776
Right now,

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.776
on a perfect day at the equator,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.896
in the middle of summer on Mars,

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.376
temperatures can
actually reach 70 degrees,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.816
but then they go down
to minus 100 at night.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.416
(Laughter)

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.080
What we're shooting for
is a runaway greenhouse effect:

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.616
enough temperature rise
to see a lot of that ice on Mars --

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.080
especially the ice in the ground -- melt.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.400
Then we get some real magic.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.176
As the atmosphere gets thicker,
everything gets better.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.816
We get more protection from radiation,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.936
more atmosphere makes us warmer,
makes the planet warmer,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.656
so we get running water

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.280
and that makes crops possible.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.896
Then more water vapor goes into the air,
forming yet another potent greenhouse gas.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.360
It will rain and it will snow on Mars.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.416
And a thicker atmosphere
will create enough pressure

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.976
so that we can
throw away those space suits.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.376
We only need about five pounds
of pressure to survive.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:52.680
Eventually, Mars will be made
to feel a lot like British Columbia.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.376
We'll still be left
with the complicated problem

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.136
of making the atmosphere breathable,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.120
and frankly that could take
1,000 years to accomplish.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.936
But humans are amazingly smart
and incredibly adaptable.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.936
There is no telling what our future
technology will be able to accomplish

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.730
and no telling what we can do
with our own bodies.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.256
In biology right now,

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.496
we are on the very verge of being
able to control our own genetics,

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.056
what the genes
in our own bodies are doing,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.216
and certainly,

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.120
eventually, our own evolution.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.536
We could end up with a species
of human being on Earth

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.600
that is slightly different
from the species of human beings on Mars.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.536
But what would you do there?
How would you live?

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.000
It's going to be
the same as it is on Earth.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.816
Somebody's going to start a restaurant,

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.960
somebody's going to build an iron foundry.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.056
Someone will make
documentary movies of Mars

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.480
and sell them on Earth.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.576
Some idiot will start a reality TV show.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.040
(Laughter)

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.936
There will be software companies,

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.360
there will be hotels, there will be bars.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.176
This much is certain:

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.416
it will be the most disruptive
event in our lifetimes,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.800
and I think it will be the most inspiring.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.856
Ask any 10-year-old girl
if she wants to go to Mars.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.200
Children who are now in elementary school
are going to choose to live there.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.680
Remember when we landed
humans on the Moon?

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.096
When that happened,
people looked at each other and said,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.800
"If we can do this, we can do anything."

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.880
What are they going to think
when we actually form a colony on Mars?

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.296
Most importantly,

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.696
it will make us a spacefaring species.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:49.176
And that means humans will survive
no matter what happens on Earth.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.296
We will never be the last of our kind.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.536
Thank you.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.140
(Applause)
