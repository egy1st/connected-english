00:00:00.856 --> 00:00:03.190
I want to introduce you
to an amazing woman.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.698
Her name is Davinia.

00:00:06.444 --> 00:00:10.849
Davinia was born in Jamaica,
emigrated to the US at the age of 18,

00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:13.604
and now lives just outside
of Washington, DC.

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:17.064
She's not a high-powered
political staffer,

00:00:17.088 --> 00:00:18.261
nor a lobbyist.

00:00:18.676 --> 00:00:21.605
She'd probably tell you
she's quite unremarkable,

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:24.154
but she's having
the most remarkable impact.

00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:25.991
What's incredible about Davinia

00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:28.878
is that she's willing to spend
time every single week

00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:31.307
focused on people who are not her:

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:35.710
people not her in her neighborhood,
her state, nor even in her country --

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.967
people she'd likely never meet.

00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:39.931
Davinia's impact started a few years ago

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:42.699
when she reached out
to all of her friends on Facebook,

00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:44.906
and asked them to donate their pennies

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.373
so she could fund girls' education.

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:49.804
She wasn't expecting a huge response,

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:52.611
but 700,000 pennies later,

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.951
she's now sent over 120 girls to school.

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:57.162
When we spoke last week,

00:00:57.186 --> 00:01:00.224
she told me she's become
a little infamous at the local bank

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:04.526
every time she rocks up
with a shopping cart full of pennies.

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:07.608
Now -- Davinia is not alone.

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:09.314
Far from it.

00:01:09.717 --> 00:01:12.003
She's part of a growing movement.

00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:14.060
And there's a name
for people like Davinia:

00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:16.100
global citizens.

00:01:16.935 --> 00:01:21.406
A global citizen is someone
who self-identifies first and foremost

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.232
not as a member of a state,
a tribe or a nation,

00:01:25.256 --> 00:01:27.443
but as a member of the human race,

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:32.307
and someone who is prepared
to act on that belief,

00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:35.226
to tackle our world's greatest challenges.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.703
Our work is focused on finding,

00:01:37.727 --> 00:01:40.610
supporting and activating global citizens.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.532
They exist in every country

00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:44.459
and among every demographic.

00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:46.770
I want to make the case to you today

00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:49.872
that the world's future depends
on global citizens.

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:54.198
I'm convinced that if we had
more global citizens active in our world,

00:01:54.222 --> 00:01:56.957
then every single one
of the major challenges we face --

00:01:56.981 --> 00:02:00.579
from poverty, climate change,
gender inequality --

00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:02.787
these issues become solvable.

00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:05.407
They are ultimately global issues,

00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:07.312
and they can ultimately only be solved

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:11.731
by global citizens demanding
global solutions from their leaders.

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.232
Now, some people's immediate
reaction to this idea

00:02:15.256 --> 00:02:19.124
is that it's either a bit utopian
or even threatening.

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:22.616
So I'd like to share with you
a little of my story today,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.351
how I ended up here,

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:26.163
how it connects with Davinia

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.628
and, hopefully, with you.

00:02:28.256 --> 00:02:30.072
Growing up in Melbourne, Australia,

00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:33.435
I was one of those seriously
irritating little kids

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.783
that never, ever stopped asking, "Why?"

00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:37.402
You might have been one yourself.

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:40.798
I used to ask my mum
the most annoying questions.

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:43.621
I'd ask her questions like,
"Mum, why I can't I dress up

00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:45.572
and play with puppets all day?"

00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:47.596
"Why do you want fries with that?"

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:49.126
"What is a shrimp,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.822
and why do we have to keep
throwing them on the barbie?"

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:52.847
(Laughter)

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:54.679
"And mum -- this haircut.

00:02:54.703 --> 00:02:55.876
Why?"

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.328
(Laughter)

00:02:58.126 --> 00:02:59.880
The worst haircut, I think.

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:02.515
Still terrible.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.341
As a "why" kid, I thought
I could change the world,

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:07.965
and it was impossible
to convince me otherwise.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.576
And when I was 12
and in my first year of high school,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.837
I started raising money
for communities in the developing world.

00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:16.056
We were a really
enthusiastic group of kids,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.341
and we raised more money
than any other school in Australia.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.953
And so I was awarded the chance
to go to the Philippines to learn more.

00:03:22.977 --> 00:03:24.891
It was 1998.

00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:28.602
We were taken into a slum
in the outskirts of Manila.

00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:32.356
It was there I became friends
with Sonny Boy,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.919
who lived on what was literally
a pile of steaming garbage.

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:38.626
"Smoky Mountain" was what they called it.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.935
But don't let the romance
of that name fool you,

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.320
because it was nothing more
than a rancid landfill

00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:47.685
that kids like Sonny Boy spent hours
rummaging through every single day

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.645
to find something, anything of value.

00:03:51.304 --> 00:03:54.580
That night with Sonny Boy and his family
changed my life forever,

00:03:54.604 --> 00:03:56.627
because when it came time to go to sleep,

00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:00.398
we simply laid down on this concrete
slab the size of half my bedroom

00:04:00.422 --> 00:04:03.328
with myself, Sonny Boy,
and the rest of his family,

00:04:03.352 --> 00:04:04.963
seven of us in this long line,

00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:07.381
with the smell of rubbish all around us

00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:09.539
and cockroaches crawling all around.

00:04:09.952 --> 00:04:11.231
And I didn't sleep a wink,

00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:12.964
but I lay awake thinking to myself,

00:04:12.988 --> 00:04:15.470
"Why should anyone have to live like this

00:04:15.494 --> 00:04:16.846
when I have so much?

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.036
Why should Sonny Boy's ability
to live out his dreams

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.106
be determined by where he's born,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.891
or what Warren Buffett called
'the ovarian lottery?'"

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:26.954
I just didn't get it,

00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:28.844
and I needed to understand why.

00:04:29.656 --> 00:04:32.002
Now, I only later came to understand

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:34.454
that the poverty I'd seen
in the Philippines

00:04:34.478 --> 00:04:38.787
was the result of decisions made
or not made, man-made,

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:42.216
by a succession of colonial powers
and corrupt governments

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.405
who had anything but the interests
of Sonny Boy at heart.

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:49.229
Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain,
but they may as well have.

00:04:49.253 --> 00:04:51.854
And if we're to try to help
kids like Sonny Boy,

00:04:51.878 --> 00:04:54.570
it wouldn't work just to try
to send him a few dollars

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:57.682
or to try to clean up
the garbage dump on which he lived,

00:04:57.706 --> 00:05:00.190
because the core
of the problem lay elsewhere.

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:03.873
And as I worked on community
development projects over the coming years

00:05:03.897 --> 00:05:05.739
trying to help build schools,

00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:08.804
train teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS,

00:05:08.828 --> 00:05:11.265
I came to see that community development

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.845
should be driven
by communities themselves,

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:17.622
and that although charity is necessary,
it's not sufficient.

00:05:17.646 --> 00:05:19.507
We need to confront these challenges

00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:22.197
on a global scale and in a systemic way.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:23.666
And the best thing I could do

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.197
is try to mobilize a large group
of citizens back home

00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:30.784
to insist that our leaders engage
in that systemic change.

00:05:31.315 --> 00:05:33.315
That's why, a few years later,

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:35.608
I joined with a group of college friends

00:05:35.632 --> 00:05:39.010
in bringing the Make Poverty History
campaign to Australia.

00:05:39.447 --> 00:05:42.825
We had this dream of staging
this small concert

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.722
around the time of the G20
with local Aussie artists,

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.398
and it suddenly exploded one day

00:05:48.422 --> 00:05:52.024
when we got a phone call from Bono,
the Edge and Pearl Jam,

00:05:52.048 --> 00:05:55.317
who all agreed to headline our concert.

00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:57.942
I got a little bit excited
that day, as you can see.

00:05:57.966 --> 00:05:59.904
(Laughter)

00:05:59.928 --> 00:06:01.207
But to our amazement,

00:06:01.231 --> 00:06:04.323
the Australian government
heard our collective voices,

00:06:04.347 --> 00:06:08.041
and they agreed to double investment
into global health and development --

00:06:08.065 --> 00:06:10.780
an additional 6.2 billion dollars.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.455
It felt like --

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.938
(Applause)

00:06:16.962 --> 00:06:19.555
It felt like this incredible validation.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:22.945
By rallying citizens together,
we helped persuade our government

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:24.455
to do the unthinkable,

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.124
and act to fix a problem
miles outside of our borders.

00:06:28.965 --> 00:06:30.267
But here's the thing:

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:32.457
it didn't last.

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:34.895
See, there was a change in government,

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.607
and six years later, all that new money

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:38.797
disappeared.

00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:40.774
What did we learn?

00:06:41.703 --> 00:06:44.780
We learned that one-off spikes
are not enough.

00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:47.685
We needed a sustainable movement,

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:51.693
not one that is susceptible
to the fluctuating moods of a politician

00:06:51.717 --> 00:06:53.994
or the hint of an economic downturn.

00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:56.120
And it needed to happen everywhere;

00:06:56.144 --> 00:07:00.049
otherwise, every individual government
would have this built-in excuse mechanism

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:04.182
that they couldn't possibly carry
the burden of global action alone.

00:07:05.405 --> 00:07:07.500
And so this is what we embarked upon.

00:07:08.103 --> 00:07:11.080
And as we embarked upon
this challenge, we asked ourselves,

00:07:11.104 --> 00:07:14.601
how do we gain enough pressure
and build a broad enough army

00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:16.713
to win these fights for the long term?

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.386
We could only think of one way.

00:07:20.034 --> 00:07:22.745
We needed to somehow turn
that short-term excitement

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:25.666
of people involved with
the Make Poverty History campaign

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.292
into long-term passion.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.819
It had to be part of their identity.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:35.241
So in 2012, we cofounded an organization
that had exactly that as its goal.

00:07:35.836 --> 00:07:37.725
And there was only one name for it:

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:39.558
Global Citizen.

00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:42.748
But this is not about
any one organization.

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:45.618
This is about citizens taking action.

00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:47.802
And research data tells us

00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:52.057
that of the total population
who even care about global issues,

00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:55.586
only 18 percent have done
anything about it.

00:07:56.237 --> 00:07:58.571
It's not that people don't want to act.

00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:01.026
It's often that they don't
know how to take action,

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.151
or that they believe that their actions
will have no effect.

00:08:04.175 --> 00:08:07.700
So we had to somehow recruit
and activate millions of citizens

00:08:07.724 --> 00:08:09.385
in dozens of countries

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:12.708
to put pressure on their leaders
to behave altruistically.

00:08:12.732 --> 00:08:15.753
And as we did so, we discovered
something really thrilling,

00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:19.213
that when you make
global citizenship your mission,

00:08:19.237 --> 00:08:22.719
you suddenly find yourself
with some extraordinary allies.

00:08:22.743 --> 00:08:26.608
See, extreme poverty isn't the only issue
that's fundamentally global.

00:08:26.632 --> 00:08:28.496
So, too, is climate change,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.096
human rights, gender equality,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.706
even conflict.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.322
We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder

00:08:35.346 --> 00:08:38.991
with people who are passionate about
targeting all these interrelated issues.

00:08:39.316 --> 00:08:41.353
But how did we actually
go about recruiting

00:08:41.377 --> 00:08:43.303
and engaging those global citizens?

00:08:43.327 --> 00:08:46.598
Well, we used the universal language:

00:08:47.034 --> 00:08:48.263
music.

00:08:48.287 --> 00:08:50.550
We launched the Global Citizen Festival

00:08:50.574 --> 00:08:53.424
in the heart of New York City
in Central Park,

00:08:53.448 --> 00:08:57.216
and we persuaded some of the world's
biggest artists to participate.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.556
We made sure that
these festivals coincided

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.721
with the UN General Assembly meeting,

00:09:01.745 --> 00:09:04.199
so that leaders who need
to hear our voices

00:09:04.223 --> 00:09:05.952
couldn't possible ignore them.

00:09:06.828 --> 00:09:08.169
But there was a twist:

00:09:08.884 --> 00:09:10.539
you couldn't buy a ticket.

00:09:10.563 --> 00:09:11.753
You had to earn it.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.197
You had to take action
on behalf of a global cause,

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:18.813
and only once you'd done that
could you earn enough points to qualify.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.463
Activism is the currency.

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:26.479
I had no interest in citizenship
purely as some sort of feel-good thing.

00:09:26.503 --> 00:09:30.780
For me, citizenship means you have to act,
and that's what we required.

00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:32.765
And amazingly, it worked.

00:09:32.789 --> 00:09:37.496
Last year, more than 155,000 citizens
in the New York area alone

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.423
earned enough points to qualify.

00:09:39.447 --> 00:09:43.811
Globally, we've now signed up citizens
in over 150 countries around the world.

00:09:43.835 --> 00:09:47.247
And last year, we signed up
more than 100,000 new members

00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:49.224
each and every week of the whole year.

00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:53.811
See, we don't need to create
global citizens from nothing.

00:09:53.835 --> 00:09:55.764
We're already everywhere.

00:09:55.788 --> 00:09:57.967
We just need to be organized

00:09:57.991 --> 00:09:59.639
and motivated to start acting.

00:10:00.229 --> 00:10:03.324
And this is where I believe
we can learn a lot from Davinia,

00:10:03.348 --> 00:10:07.298
who started taking action
as a global citizen back in 2012.

00:10:07.925 --> 00:10:09.147
Here's what she did.

00:10:09.587 --> 00:10:11.131
It wasn't rocket science.

00:10:11.537 --> 00:10:13.813
She started writing letters,

00:10:13.837 --> 00:10:16.123
emailing politicians' offices.

00:10:16.147 --> 00:10:19.142
She volunteered her time
in her local community.

00:10:19.166 --> 00:10:21.778
That's when she got active on social media

00:10:21.802 --> 00:10:24.032
and started to collect pennies --

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.357
a lot of pennies.

00:10:26.264 --> 00:10:29.542
Now, maybe that doesn't sound
like a lot to you.

00:10:30.252 --> 00:10:31.748
How will that achieve anything?

00:10:32.502 --> 00:10:35.617
Well, it achieved a lot
because she wasn't alone.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.650
Her actions, alongside 142,000
other global citizens',

00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:43.315
led the US government
to double their investment

00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:45.170
into Global Partnership for Education.

00:10:45.194 --> 00:10:46.733
And here's Dr. Raj Shah,

00:10:46.757 --> 00:10:49.259
the head of USAID,
making that announcement.

00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:53.122
See, when thousands of global citizens
find inspiration from each other,

00:10:53.146 --> 00:10:55.825
it's amazing to see
their collective power.

00:10:55.849 --> 00:10:59.261
Global citizens like Davinia
helped persuade the World Bank

00:10:59.285 --> 00:11:01.960
to boost their investment
into water and sanitation.

00:11:01.984 --> 00:11:06.024
Here's the Bank's president Jim Kim
announcing 15 billion dollars onstage

00:11:06.048 --> 00:11:07.310
at Global Citizen,

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:10.840
and Prime Minister Modi of India
affirmed his commitment

00:11:10.864 --> 00:11:15.748
to put a toilet in every household
and school across India by 2019.

00:11:16.494 --> 00:11:20.710
Global citizens encouraged
by the late-night host Stephen Colbert

00:11:20.734 --> 00:11:23.686
launched a Twitter invasion on Norway.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.917
Erna Solberg, the country's
Prime Minister, got the message,

00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:29.949
committing to double investment
into girls' education.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.235
Global citizens together with Rotarians
called on the Canadian, UK,

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:35.660
and Australian governments

00:11:35.684 --> 00:11:38.546
to boost their investment
into polio eradication.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.679
They got together and committed
665 million dollars.

00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:46.357
But despite all of this momentum,

00:11:47.277 --> 00:11:49.277
we face some huge challenges.

00:11:50.008 --> 00:11:51.888
See, you might be thinking to yourself,

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:54.236
how can we possibly persuade world leaders

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.617
to sustain a focus on global issues?

00:11:57.474 --> 00:12:02.557
Indeed, the powerful American
politician Tip O'Neill once said,

00:12:02.581 --> 00:12:04.580
"All politics is local."

00:12:05.762 --> 00:12:08.535
That's what always
got politicians elected:

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:11.581
to seek, gain and hold onto power

00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:15.478
through the pursuit of local
or at very best national interests.

00:12:16.185 --> 00:12:20.497
I experienced this for the first time
when I was 21 years old.

00:12:21.113 --> 00:12:22.495
I took a meeting

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:26.958
with a then-Australian Foreign Minister
who shall remain nameless --

00:12:27.655 --> 00:12:28.946
[Alexander Downer]

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.728
(Laughter)

00:12:31.515 --> 00:12:32.737
And behind closed doors,

00:12:32.761 --> 00:12:35.237
I shared with him my passion
to end extreme poverty.

00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:39.180
I said, "Minister -- Australia
has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

00:12:39.204 --> 00:12:41.893
to help achieve the Millennium
Development Goals.

00:12:41.917 --> 00:12:43.163
We can do this."

00:12:43.806 --> 00:12:45.244
And he paused,

00:12:45.268 --> 00:12:47.790
looked down on me
with cold, dismissive eyes,

00:12:48.465 --> 00:12:49.933
and he said, "Hugh,

00:12:49.957 --> 00:12:52.147
no one gives a funk about foreign aid."

00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:54.425
Except he didn't use the word "funk."

00:12:55.528 --> 00:12:56.689
He went on.

00:12:56.713 --> 00:12:59.270
He said we need to look after
our own backyard first.

00:12:59.872 --> 00:13:01.035
This is, I believe,

00:13:01.059 --> 00:13:03.526
outdated, even dangerous thinking.

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:05.932
Or as my late grandfather would say,

00:13:05.956 --> 00:13:07.301
complete BS.

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.947
Parochialism offers this false dichotomy

00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:14.477
because it pits the poor in one country
against the poor in another.

00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:18.350
It pretends we can isolate ourselves
and our nations from one another.

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:20.766
The whole world is our backyard,

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.671
and we ignore it at our peril.

00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:24.893
See, look what happened
when we ignored Rwanda,

00:13:24.917 --> 00:13:26.385
when we ignore Syria,

00:13:26.409 --> 00:13:28.312
when we ignore climate change.

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:30.519
Political leaders ought to give a "funk"

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:33.206
because the impact of climate change
and extreme poverty

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.586
comes right to our shore.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.720
Now, global citizens --
they understand this.

00:13:37.744 --> 00:13:40.994
We live in a time that favors
the global citizen,

00:13:41.018 --> 00:13:43.930
in an age where every
single voice can be heard.

00:13:43.954 --> 00:13:45.122
See, do you remember

00:13:45.146 --> 00:13:48.612
when the Millennium Development Goals
were signed back in the year 2000?

00:13:48.636 --> 00:13:51.541
The most we could do in those days
was fire off a letter

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:53.276
and wait for the next election.

00:13:53.737 --> 00:13:55.411
There was no social media.

00:13:55.998 --> 00:13:59.213
Today, billions of citizens
have more tools,

00:13:59.237 --> 00:14:01.055
more access to information,

00:14:01.079 --> 00:14:03.530
more capacity to influence
than ever before.

00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:07.893
Both the problems and the tools
to solve them are right before us.

00:14:08.377 --> 00:14:10.443
The world has changed,

00:14:10.467 --> 00:14:12.864
and those of us who look
beyond our borders

00:14:12.888 --> 00:14:14.928
are on the right side of history.

00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:17.309
So where are we?

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:20.265
So we run this amazing festival,

00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:22.604
we've scored some big policy wins,

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:25.127
and citizens are signing up
all over the world.

00:14:25.817 --> 00:14:27.873
But have we achieved our mission?

00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:29.809
No.

00:14:30.285 --> 00:14:31.930
We have such a long way to go.

00:14:32.946 --> 00:14:35.128
But this is the opportunity that I see.

00:14:36.414 --> 00:14:38.541
The concept of global citizenship,

00:14:39.716 --> 00:14:45.412
self-evident in its logic but until now
impractical in many ways,

00:14:45.436 --> 00:14:49.566
has coincided with this particular moment
in which we are privileged to live.

00:14:50.044 --> 00:14:51.196
We, as global citizens,

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.807
now have a unique opportunity
to accelerate large-scale positive change

00:14:55.831 --> 00:14:57.068
around the world.

00:14:57.554 --> 00:14:59.713
So in the months and years ahead,

00:14:59.737 --> 00:15:02.781
global citizens will hold
world leaders accountable

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:05.851
to ensure that the new Global Goals
for Sustainable Development

00:15:05.875 --> 00:15:07.540
are tracked and implemented.

00:15:08.048 --> 00:15:10.926
Global citizens will partner
with the world's leading NGOs

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.782
to end diseases like polio and malaria.

00:15:14.243 --> 00:15:17.410
Global citizens will sign up
in every corner of this globe,

00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:20.090
increasing the frequency, quality

00:15:20.114 --> 00:15:21.859
and impact of their actions.

00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:24.938
These dreams are within reach.

00:15:25.503 --> 00:15:28.043
Imagine an army of millions

00:15:28.067 --> 00:15:30.264
growing into tens of millions,

00:15:30.288 --> 00:15:34.035
connected, informed, engaged

00:15:34.638 --> 00:15:36.820
and unwilling to take no for an answer.

00:15:38.432 --> 00:15:39.992
Over all these years,

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.405
I've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.603
Sadly, I've been unable to.

00:15:48.611 --> 00:15:50.804
We met long before social media,

00:15:51.479 --> 00:15:54.243
and his address has now
been relocated by the authorities,

00:15:54.267 --> 00:15:56.130
as often happens with slums.

00:15:57.923 --> 00:15:59.357
I'd love to sit down with him,

00:15:59.381 --> 00:16:00.574
wherever he is,

00:16:01.312 --> 00:16:05.390
and share with him how much the time
I spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.429
Thanks to him and so many others,

00:16:08.453 --> 00:16:12.124
I came to understand the importance
of being part of a movement of people --

00:16:12.752 --> 00:16:16.219
the kids willing to look up
from their screens and out to the world,

00:16:16.743 --> 00:16:18.211
the global citizens.

00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:21.227
Global citizens who stand together,

00:16:21.973 --> 00:16:23.775
who ask the question "Why?,"

00:16:24.663 --> 00:16:26.415
who reject the naysayers,

00:16:26.938 --> 00:16:30.161
and embrace the amazing possibilities
of the world we share.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.605
I'm a global citizen.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.343
Are you?

00:16:34.841 --> 00:16:36.023
Thank you.

00:16:36.047 --> 00:16:43.613
(Applause)
