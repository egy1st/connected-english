WEBVTT

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.261
[On April 3, 2016 we saw
the largest data leak in history.]

00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:08.892
[The Panama Papers exposed
rich and powerful people]

00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:11.382
[hiding vast amounts of money
in offshore accounts.]

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:14.338
[What does this mean?]

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:18.212
[We called Robert Palmer
of Global Witness to explain.]

00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:25.804
This week, there have been
a whole slew and deluge of stories

00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:29.124
coming out from the leak
of 11 million documents

00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:33.572
from a Panamanian-based law firm
called Mossack Fonseca.

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:39.378
The release of these papers from Panama
lifts the veil on a tiny piece

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:41.640
of the secretive offshore world.

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:46.972
We get an insight into how clients
and banks and lawyers

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:49.024
go to companies like Mossack Fonseca

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.555
and say, "OK, we want
an anonymous company,

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.971
can you give us one?"

00:00:52.995 --> 00:00:54.805
So you actually get to see the emails,

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.792
you get to see the exchanges of messages,

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:59.891
you get to see the mechanics
of how this works,

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:01.316
how this operates.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.393
Now, this has already started
to have pretty immediate repercussions.

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:08.018
The Prime Minister
of Iceland has resigned.

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:09.257
We've also had news

00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:14.324
that an ally of the brutal
Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad

00:01:14.348 --> 00:01:16.903
has also got offshore companies.

00:01:16.927 --> 00:01:22.156
There's been allegations
of a $2 billion money trail

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.083
that leads back to President
Vladimir Putin of Russia

00:01:26.107 --> 00:01:28.568
via his close childhood friend,

00:01:28.592 --> 00:01:30.820
who happens to be a top cellist.

00:01:30.844 --> 00:01:33.444
And there will be a lot
of rich individuals out there

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:37.786
and others who will be nervous
about the next set of stories

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.363
and the next set of leaked documents.

00:01:40.387 --> 00:01:44.573
Now, this sounds like the plot
of a spy thriller

00:01:44.597 --> 00:01:46.260
or a John Grisham novel.

00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:50.300
It seems very distant
from you, me, ordinary people.

00:01:50.324 --> 00:01:52.832
Why should we care about this?

00:01:52.856 --> 00:01:57.099
But the truth is that if rich
and powerful individuals

00:01:57.123 --> 00:01:59.777
are able to keep their money offshore

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:02.288
and not pay the taxes that they should,

00:02:02.312 --> 00:02:06.406
it means that there is less money
for vital public services

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.783
like healthcare, education, roads.

00:02:09.807 --> 00:02:12.128
And that affects all of us.

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:14.868
Now, for my organization Global Witness,

00:02:14.892 --> 00:02:18.954
this exposé has been phenomenal.

00:02:18.978 --> 00:02:23.466
We have the world's media
and political leaders

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.145
talking about how individuals
can use offshore secrecy

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.564
to hide and disguise their assets --

00:02:30.588 --> 00:02:35.372
something we have been talking about
and exposing for a decade.

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:40.031
Now, I think a lot of people find
this entire world baffling and confusing,

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:44.520
and hard to understand how
this sort of offshore world works.

00:02:44.544 --> 00:02:47.376
I like to think of it a bit
like a Russian doll.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.859
So you can have one company
stacked inside another company,

00:02:50.883 --> 00:02:52.994
stacked inside another company,

00:02:53.018 --> 00:02:57.429
making it almost impossible
to really understand

00:02:57.453 --> 00:02:59.680
who is behind these structures.

00:02:59.704 --> 00:03:02.617
It can be very difficult
for law enforcement

00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:05.604
or tax authorities,
journalists, civil society

00:03:05.628 --> 00:03:07.890
to really understand what's going on.

00:03:08.318 --> 00:03:09.755
I also think it's interesting

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.986
that there's been less coverage
of this issue in the United States.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.773
And that's perhaps because
some prominent US people

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:21.335
just haven't figured
in this exposé, in this scandal.

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.294
Now, that's not because
there are no rich Americans

00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:28.128
who are stashing their assets offshore.

00:03:28.152 --> 00:03:31.974
It's just because of the way
in which offshore works,

00:03:31.998 --> 00:03:35.488
Mossack Fonseca has fewer
American clients.

00:03:35.512 --> 00:03:38.768
I think if we saw leaks
from the Cayman Islands

00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:42.443
or even from Delaware
or Wyoming or Nevada,

00:03:42.467 --> 00:03:48.259
you would see many more cases
and examples linking back to Americans.

00:03:48.283 --> 00:03:54.201
In fact, in a number of US states
you need less information,

00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:58.399
you need to provide less
information to get a company

00:03:58.423 --> 00:04:01.216
than you do to get a library card.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.022
That sort of secrecy in America
has allowed employees of school districts

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.952
to rip off schoolchildren.

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:13.872
It has allowed scammers
to rip off vulnerable investors.

00:04:14.452 --> 00:04:18.142
This is the sort of behavior
that affects all of us.

00:04:18.166 --> 00:04:20.037
Now, at Global Witness,

00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:23.322
we wanted to see what this
actually looked like in practice.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.759
How does this actually work?

00:04:25.783 --> 00:04:26.958
So what we did

00:04:26.982 --> 00:04:33.219
is we sent in an undercover investigator
to 13 Manhattan law firms.

00:04:33.763 --> 00:04:37.537
Our investigator posed
as an African minister

00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:41.688
who wanted to move suspect funds
into the United States

00:04:41.712 --> 00:04:44.851
to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.

00:04:45.288 --> 00:04:50.349
Now, what was truly shocking
was that all but one of those lawyers

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:54.966
provided our investigator with suggestions

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.954
on how to move those suspect funds.

00:04:56.978 --> 00:04:58.790
These were all preliminary meetings,

00:04:58.814 --> 00:05:01.086
and none of the lawyers
took us on as a client

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.399
and of course no money moved hands,

00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:06.881
but it really shows the problem
with the system.

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:08.824
It's also important

00:05:08.848 --> 00:05:12.214
to not just think about this
as individual cases.

00:05:12.238 --> 00:05:14.451
This is not just about
an individual lawyer

00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:18.329
who's spoken to our undercover
investigator and provided suggestions.

00:05:18.353 --> 00:05:21.208
It's not just about
a particular senior politician

00:05:21.232 --> 00:05:22.861
who's been caught up in a scandal.

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:25.941
This is about how a system works,

00:05:25.965 --> 00:05:31.908
that entrenches corruption,
tax evasion, poverty and instability.

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:33.747
And in order to tackle this,

00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:35.442
we need to change the game.

00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:37.988
We need to change the rules of the game

00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:40.004
to make this sort of behavior harder.

00:05:40.028 --> 00:05:42.972
This may seem like doom and gloom,

00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:44.917
like there's nothing we can do about it,

00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:46.571
like nothing has ever changed,

00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:49.931
like there will always be rich
and powerful individuals.

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:52.402
But as a natural optimist,

00:05:52.426 --> 00:05:55.904
I do see that we are starting
to get some change.

00:05:55.928 --> 00:05:57.803
Over the last couple of years,

00:05:57.827 --> 00:06:01.495
we've seen a real push towards
greater transparency

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:03.353
when it comes to company ownership.

00:06:03.755 --> 00:06:06.092
This issue was put on the political agenda

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.610
by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:13.394
at a big G8 Summit that was held
in Northern Ireland in 2013.

00:06:13.872 --> 00:06:18.222
And since then, the European Union
is going to be creating

00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:20.403
central registers at a national level

00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:23.834
of who really owns and controls
companies across Europe.

00:06:23.858 --> 00:06:28.537
One of the things that is sad is that,
actually, the US is lagging behind.

00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.658
There's bipartisan legislation
that had been introduced

00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:33.585
in the House and the Senate,

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:36.766
but it isn't making as much progress
as we'd like to see.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.877
So we'd really want to see
the Panama leaks,

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:43.695
this huge peek into the offshore world,

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:48.771
be used as a way of opening up
in the US and around the world.

00:06:48.795 --> 00:06:53.585
For us at Global Witness,
this is a moment for change.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.698
We need ordinary people to get angry

00:06:57.722 --> 00:07:00.975
at the way in which people
can hide their identity

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:02.912
behind secret companies.

00:07:02.936 --> 00:07:06.523
We need business leaders
to stand up and say,

00:07:06.547 --> 00:07:09.831
"Secrecy like this is not
good for business."

00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:14.235
We need political leaders
to recognize the problem,

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:19.266
and to commit to changing the law
to open up this sort of secrecy.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.918
Together, we can end the secrecy

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.999
that is currently allowing tax evasion,

00:07:26.023 --> 00:07:29.214
corruption, money laundering to flourish.
