00:00:01.672 --> 00:00:06.846
I have spent the past 38 years
trying to be invisible.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.259
I'm a copy editor.

00:00:09.807 --> 00:00:11.507
I work at The New Yorker,

00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:15.705
and copyediting for The New Yorker
is like playing shortstop

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:17.943
for a Major League Baseball team:

00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:21.380
every little movement
gets picked over by the critics --

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:24.006
God forbid you should commit an error.

00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:29.023
Just to clarify: copy editors don't choose
what goes into the magazine.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.908
We work at the level of the sentence,

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:33.620
maybe the paragraph,

00:00:33.644 --> 00:00:35.722
the words, the punctuation.

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:38.880
Our business is in the details.

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:44.038
We put the diaeresis, the double dot,
over the "i" in "naïve."

00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:46.518
We impose house style.

00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:49.228
Every publication has a house style.

00:00:49.252 --> 00:00:51.775
The New Yorker's
is particularly distinctive.

00:00:52.503 --> 00:00:55.283
We sometimes get teased for our style.

00:00:55.307 --> 00:00:59.647
Imagine -- we still spell
"teen-ager" with a hyphen,

00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:01.947
as if that word had just been coined.

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:06.519
But you see that hyphen in "teen-age"

00:01:06.543 --> 00:01:09.135
and that diaeresis over "coöperate,"

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.161
and you know you're reading
The New Yorker.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.348
Copyediting at The New Yorker
is a mechanical process.

00:01:15.372 --> 00:01:18.571
There is a related role called
query proofreading,

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:20.451
or page-OK'ing.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:23.729
Whereas copyediting is mechanical,

00:01:23.753 --> 00:01:26.228
query proofreading is interpretive.

00:01:26.696 --> 00:01:30.068
We make suggestions to the author
through the editor

00:01:30.092 --> 00:01:32.713
to improve the emphasis of a sentence

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:35.371
or point out unintentional repetitions

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:39.391
and supply compelling alternatives.

00:01:40.502 --> 00:01:43.480
Our purpose is to make
the author look good.

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:46.833
Note that we give our proofs
not directly to the author,

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:48.376
but to the editor.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.517
This often creates
a good cop/bad cop dynamic

00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:56.065
in which the copy editor -- I'll use that
as an umbrella term --

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:59.096
is invariably the bad cop.

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:02.445
If we do our job well, we're invisible,

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.541
but as soon as we make a mistake,

00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:08.381
we copy editors become glaringly visible.

00:02:09.426 --> 00:02:12.957
Here is the most recent mistake
that was laid at my door.

00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:17.455
[Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin,
the pre-Trump embodiment

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.625
of populist no-nothingism
in the Republican Party,

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.096
endorsed Trump.]

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:27.143
"Where were The New Yorker's fabled
copy editors?" a reader wrote.

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:30.333
"Didn't the writer mean
'know-nothingism'?"

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.066
Ouch.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.762
There's no excuse for this mistake.

00:02:34.786 --> 00:02:37.875
But I like it: "no-nothingism."

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:41.857
It might be American
vernacular for "nihilism."

00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:45.088
(Laughter)

00:02:45.112 --> 00:02:48.136
Here, another reader quotes
a passage from the magazine:

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.197
[Ruby was seventy-six, but she retained
her authoritative bearing;

00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:56.199
only her unsteady gait belied her age.]

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.921
He added:

00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:01.028
"Surely, someone at The New Yorker
knows the meaning of 'belied,'

00:03:01.052 --> 00:03:04.260
and that it is the opposite
of how it is used in this sentence.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.958
Come on! Get it together."

00:03:06.648 --> 00:03:10.156
Belie: to give a false impression.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.227
It should have been "betrayed."

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.301
E.B. White once wrote
of commas in The New Yorker:

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:21.189
"They fall with the precision
of knives outlining a body."

00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:22.915
(Laughter)

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.745
And it's true -- we get a lot
of complaints about commas.

00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:30.120
"Are there really two commas
in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?"

00:03:30.746 --> 00:03:35.827
There may not be on the sign, but yes,
that is New Yorker style for "Jr."

00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:38.157
One wag wrote:

00:03:38.181 --> 00:03:41.623
["Please, could you expel,
or, at least, restrain,

00:03:41.647 --> 00:03:44.671
the comma-maniac,
on your editorial staff?"]

00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:46.047
(Laughter)

00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:47.222
Ah, well.

00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:49.490
In this case, those commas
are well-placed,

00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:51.385
except that there should not be one

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.411
between "maniac" and "on."

00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:54.670
(Laughter)

00:03:54.694 --> 00:03:58.442
Also, if we must have commas
around "at least,"

00:03:58.466 --> 00:04:02.506
we might change it up
by using dashes around that phrase:

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.218
"... -- or, at least, restrain --"

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:07.562
Perfect.

00:04:07.586 --> 00:04:09.164
(Applause)

00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:10.523
Then there's this:

00:04:10.547 --> 00:04:11.985
"Love you, love your magazine,

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:17.206
but can you please stop writing
massive numbers as text?"

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.784
[two and a half million ...]

00:04:18.808 --> 00:04:19.967
No.

00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:22.029
(Laughter)

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:25.155
One last cri de coeur
from a spelling stickler:

00:04:25.179 --> 00:04:30.323
["Those long stringy things
are vocal cords, not chords."]

00:04:30.347 --> 00:04:32.496
The outraged reader added,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.353
"I'm sure I'm not the first to write

00:04:34.377 --> 00:04:37.598
regarding this egregious
proofreading error,

00:04:37.622 --> 00:04:40.028
but I'm equally sure I won't be the last.

00:04:40.052 --> 00:04:41.272
Fie!"

00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:43.517
(Laughter)

00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:45.426
I used to like getting mail.

00:04:47.222 --> 00:04:49.818
There is a pact
between writers and editors.

00:04:49.842 --> 00:04:52.221
The editor never sells out the writer,

00:04:52.245 --> 00:04:55.797
never goes public about bad jokes
that had to be cut

00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:58.271
or stories that went on too long.

00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:03.153
A great editor saves a writer
from her excesses.

00:05:03.558 --> 00:05:05.586
Copy editors, too, have a code;

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.093
we don't advertise our oversights.

00:05:08.593 --> 00:05:11.293
I feel disloyal divulging them here,

00:05:11.317 --> 00:05:14.371
so let's have look at what we do right.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.474
Somehow, I've gotten
a reputation for sternness.

00:05:19.133 --> 00:05:23.250
But I work with writers who know
how to have their way with me.

00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:27.889
I've known Ian Frazier, or "Sandy,"
since the early 80s.

00:05:27.913 --> 00:05:29.542
And he's one of my favorites,

00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:32.011
even though he sometimes writes a sentence

00:05:32.035 --> 00:05:34.131
that gives a copy editor pause.

00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:37.380
Here is one from a story
about Staten Island

00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:39.395
after Hurricane Sandy:

00:05:40.092 --> 00:05:44.101
[A dock that had been broken
in the middle and lost its other half

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.509
sloped down toward the water,

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:50.213
its support pipes and wires
leaning forward

00:05:50.237 --> 00:05:54.048
like when you open a box
of linguine and it slides out.]

00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:55.326
(Laughter)

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.480
This would never have got past
the grammarian in the days of yore.

00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:01.743
But what could I do?

00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:04.371
Technically, the "like" should be an "as,"

00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:05.839
but it sounds ridiculous,

00:06:05.863 --> 00:06:09.576
as if the author were about to embark
on an extended Homeric simile --

00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:13.371
"as when you open a box of linguine."

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:14.704
(Laughter)

00:06:14.728 --> 00:06:19.504
I decided that the hurricane
conferred poetic justice on Sandy

00:06:19.528 --> 00:06:21.179
and let the sentence stand.

00:06:21.203 --> 00:06:22.290
(Laughter)

00:06:22.314 --> 00:06:24.322
Generally, if I think something is wrong,

00:06:24.346 --> 00:06:25.838
I query it three times.

00:06:25.862 --> 00:06:29.717
I told Sandy that not long ago
in a moment of indiscretion and he said,

00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:31.252
"Only three?"

00:06:31.276 --> 00:06:33.020
So, he has learned to hold out.

00:06:33.044 --> 00:06:35.443
Recently, he wrote a story
for "Talk of the Town,"

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:37.688
that's the section
at the front of the magazine

00:06:37.712 --> 00:06:40.790
with short pieces on subjects
ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit

00:06:40.814 --> 00:06:42.359
at the Metropolitan Museum

00:06:42.383 --> 00:06:45.554
to the introduction
of doggie bags in France.

00:06:45.578 --> 00:06:47.996
Sandy's story was about
the return to the Bronx

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.687
of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:53.260
There were three things
in it that I had to challenge.

00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:54.848
First, a grammar query.

00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:57.467
The justice was wearing black
and Sandy wrote,

00:06:57.491 --> 00:07:02.567
[Her face and hands stood out
like in an old, mostly dark painting.]

00:07:03.043 --> 00:07:04.993
Now, unlike with the hurricane,

00:07:05.017 --> 00:07:07.485
with this "like," the author
didn't have the excuse

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:09.316
of describing hurricane damage.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.636
"Like" in this sense is a preposition,
and a preposition takes an object,

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.853
which is a noun.

00:07:14.877 --> 00:07:17.409
This "like" had to be an "as."

00:07:17.433 --> 00:07:20.591
"As in an old, mostly dark painting."

00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:22.265
Second, a spelling issue.

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.284
The author was quoting someone
who was assisting the justice:

00:07:25.986 --> 00:07:27.408
["It will be just a minute.

00:07:27.432 --> 00:07:30.073
We are getting the justice mic'ed,"]

00:07:31.434 --> 00:07:32.584
Mic'ed?

00:07:32.982 --> 00:07:34.979
The music industry spells it "mic"

00:07:35.003 --> 00:07:37.361
because that's how it's spelled
on the equipment.

00:07:37.385 --> 00:07:39.812
I'd never seen it used
as a verb with this spelling,

00:07:39.836 --> 00:07:42.366
and I was distraught
to think that "mic'ed"

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.675
would get into the magazine on my watch.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:45.710
(Laughter)

00:07:45.734 --> 00:07:49.653
New Yorker style for "microphone"
in its abbreviated form is "mike."

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:53.146
Finally, there was a sticky
grammar and usage issue

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.884
in which the pronoun has to have
the same grammatical number

00:07:56.908 --> 00:07:58.359
as its antecedent.

00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:02.887
[everyone in the vicinity
held their breath]

00:08:03.491 --> 00:08:07.686
"Their" is plural and "everyone,"
its antecedent, is singular.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.648
You would never say,
"Everyone were there."

00:08:10.672 --> 00:08:14.513
Everyone was there. Everyone is here.

00:08:14.537 --> 00:08:18.151
But people say things like,
"Everyone held their breath" all the time.

00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:19.394
To give it legitimacy,

00:08:19.418 --> 00:08:22.841
copy editors call it
"the singular 'their,'"

00:08:22.865 --> 00:08:25.930
as if calling it singular
makes it no longer plural.

00:08:25.954 --> 00:08:27.348
(Laughter)

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:32.571
It is my job when I see it in print
to do my best to eliminate it.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.848
I couldn't make it,
"Everyone held her breath,"

00:08:35.872 --> 00:08:37.564
or "Everyone held his breath,"

00:08:37.588 --> 00:08:40.150
or "Everyone held his or her breath."

00:08:40.174 --> 00:08:42.994
Whatever I suggested had to blend in.

00:08:43.018 --> 00:08:44.374
I asked, through the editor,

00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:46.446
if the author would consider changing it

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.041
to "All in the vicinity
held their breath,"

00:08:49.065 --> 00:08:50.907
because "all" is plural.

00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:52.088
Nope.

00:08:52.112 --> 00:08:55.342
I tried again: "All those present
held their breath?"

00:08:55.366 --> 00:08:57.587
I thought this sounded vaguely judicial.

00:08:57.611 --> 00:08:58.858
But the editor pointed out

00:08:58.882 --> 00:09:01.287
that we could not have "present"
and "presence"

00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:02.754
in the same sentence.

00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:04.687
When the final proof came back,

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.287
the author had accepted "as" for "like,"

00:09:07.311 --> 00:09:09.246
and "miked" for "mic'ed."

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.744
But on "Everyone held their breath,"
he stood his ground.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.886
Two out of three isn't bad.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.253
In the same issue,

00:09:17.277 --> 00:09:19.799
in that piece on doggie bags in France,

00:09:19.823 --> 00:09:23.561
there was the gratuitous use
of the f-word by a Frenchman.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.864
I wonder, when the mail comes in,
