00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
How does the news shape the way we see the world?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And here's how news shapes what Americans see.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This map -- (Applause) -- this map shows the number of seconds

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
There was massive flooding in Indonesia.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
here's how the world looked.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
What was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And the cycle continues;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So, why don't we hear more about the world?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
-- places that are home to more than two billion people.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
when we see where people go for news.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Local TV news looms large,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And what about the web?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The most popular news sites don't do much better.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that appeared on Google News' front page.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
as well as less educated Americans,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And if you think it's simply because we are not interested,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
you would be wrong.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
grew to over 50 percent.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
in our increasingly interconnected world?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I know we can do better.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And can we afford not to? Thank you.
