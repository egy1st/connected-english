00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.416
I have one more reason for optimism:

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.896
climate change.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.680
Maybe you don't believe it,
but here is the fact.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.800
On December 12, 2015,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.216
in Paris, under the United Nations,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.696
195 governments got together

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.880
and unanimously --

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.816
if you've worked with governments,
you know how difficult that is --

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.056
unanimously decided

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.896
to intentionally change the course
of the global economy

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.736
in order to protect the most vulnerable

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.416
and improve the life of all of us.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.856
Now, that is a remarkable achievement.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.096
(Applause)

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.256
But it is even more remarkable

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.256
if you consider where we had been
just a few years ago.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.936
2009, Copenhagen.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600
Who remembers Copenhagen?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.736
Well, after years of working
toward a climate agreement,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.920
the same governments
convened in Copenhagen

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.040
and failed miserably.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.016
Why did it fail miserably?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.616
For many different reasons,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.176
but primarily because
of the deeply entrenched divide

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.920
between the global
North and the global South.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.616
So now, six months after this failure,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.976
I was called in
to assume the responsibility

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.056
of the global climate change negotiations.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.456
You can imagine, the perfect moment
to start this new job.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.176
The global mood on climate change
was in the trash can.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.656
No one believed

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.640
that a global agreement
could ever be possible.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.200
In fact, neither did I.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.976
If you promise not to tell anyone
outside of this wonderful TED audience,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.096
I'm going to divulge a secret

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.480
that has been gratefully
buried by history.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.296
On my first press conference,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.696
a journalist asked, "Um, Ms. Figueres,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.096
do you think that a global agreement
is ever going to be possible?"

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.456
And without engaging brain,
I heard me utter,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.080
"Not in my lifetime."

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.776
Well, you can imagine
the faces of my press team

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.496
who were horrified
at this crazy Costa Rican woman

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.920
who was their new boss.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.336
And I was horrified, too.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.616
Now, I wasn't horrified at me,
because I'm kind of used to myself.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.816
I was actually horrified

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.536
at the consequences
of what I had just said,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.736
at the consequences for the world

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.160
in which all our children
are going to have to live.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.056
It was frankly a horrible moment for me,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.176
and I thought, well, no, hang on,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.816
hang on.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.656
Impossible is not a fact,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.120
it's an attitude.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.176
It's only an attitude.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.136
And I decided right then and there
that I was going to change my attitude

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.800
and I was going to help the world
change its attitude on climate change.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.736
So I don't know --

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.736
No, just this? Thanks.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.960
I don't know --

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.656
what you would do

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.120
if you were told
your job is to save the planet.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.760
Put that on the job description.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.696
And you have full responsibility,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.856
but you have absolutely no authority,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.720
because governments are sovereign
in every decision that they take.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.016
Well, I would really love to know

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.296
what you would do
on the first Monday morning,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.736
but here's what I did: I panicked.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.416
(Laughter)

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.936
And then I panicked again,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.000
because I realized I have no idea
how we're going to solve this problem.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.856
And then I realized I have no idea
how we're going to solve this problem,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.816
but I do know one thing:

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.816
we have got to change
the tone of this conversation.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.936
Because there is no way
you can deliver victory

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.160
without optimism.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.616
And here,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.176
I use optimism as a very simple word,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.976
but let's understand it
in its broader sense.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.896
Let's understand it as courage,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.896
hope, trust, solidarity,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.816
the fundamental belief
that we humans can come together

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.120
and can help each other
to better the fate of mankind.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.416
Well, you can imagine
that I thought that without that,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.896
there was no way we were going
to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.736
And for six years,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.616
I have stubbornly, relentlessly
injected optimism into the system,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.496
no matter what the questions
from the press --

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.696
and I have gotten better at those --

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.896
and no matter what the evidence
to the contrary.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.400
And believe you me, there has been
a lot of contrary evidence.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.640
But relentless optimism into the system.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.856
And pretty soon,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.216
we began to see changes
happening in many areas,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.496
precipitated by thousands of people,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.136
including many of you here today,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.360
and I thank you.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.136
And this TED community
will not be surprised

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.776
if I tell you the first area

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.936
in which we saw remarkable change

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.160
was ...

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.520
technology.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.216
We began to see that clean technologies,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.696
in particular renewable
energy technologies,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.336
began to drop price
and increase in capacity,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.416
to the point where today
we are already building

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.176
concentrated solar power plants

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.656
that have the capacity
to power entire cities,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.816
to say nothing of the fact
of what we are doing on mobility

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.720
and intelligent buildings.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.216
And with this shift in technologies,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.416
we were able to begin to understand

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.000
that there was a shift
in the economic equation,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.816
because we were able to recognize

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.936
that yes, there are
huge costs to climate change,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.496
and yes, there are compounded risks.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.176
But there also are economic advantages

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.896
and intrinsic benefits,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.856
because the dissemination
of the clean technologies

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.880
is going to bring us cleaner air,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.016
better health,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.576
better transportation,
more livable cities,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.136
more energy security,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.616
more energy access
to the developing world.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.680
In sum, a better world
than what we have now.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.520
And with that understanding,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.336
you should have witnessed,
in fact, part of you were,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.696
the spread of ingenuity and excitement

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.736
that went through,
first through nonnational governments,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.896
the private sector, captains of industry,
insurance companies,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.216
investors, city leaders,
faith communities,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.576
because they all began to understand,
this actually can be in their interest.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.120
This can actually
improve their bottom line.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.600
And it wasn't just the usual suspects.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.056
I have to tell you I had the CEO
of a major, major oil and gas company

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.416
come to me at the beginning of last year

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.640
and say --

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.280
privately, of course --

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.136
he did not know how
he was going to change his company,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.336
but he is going to change it,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.040
because he's interested
in long-term viability.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.016
Well, now we have a shift
in the economic equation,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.376
and with that, with broader
support from everyone,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.776
it did not take very long
before we saw that national governments

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.656
woke up to the fact
that this is in their national interest.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.816
And when we asked countries
to begin to identify

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.736
how they could contribute
to global efforts

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.096
but based on their national interest,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.376
189 countries out of 195,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.736
189 countries sent their
comprehensive climate change plans,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.895
based on their national interest,

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.816
concurrent with their priorities,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.320
consistent with their national
sustainable development plans.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.880
Well,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.976
once you protect
the core interests of nations,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.656
then you can understand
that nations were ready

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.296
to begin to converge onto a common path,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.576
onto a common direction of travel

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.736
that is going to take us
probably several decades,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.256
but over those several decades
is going to take us

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.736
into the new economy,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.336
into a decarbonized,
highly resilient economy,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.736
And the national contributions
that are currently on the table

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.056
on behalf of national governments

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.216
are insufficient to get us
to a stabilized climate,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.296
but they are only the first step,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.336
and they will improve over time.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.776
And the measurement, reporting
and verification of all of those efforts

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.456
is legally binding.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.216
And the checkpoints that we're
going to have every five years

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.736
to assess collective progress
towards our goal are legally binding,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.656
and the path itself toward
a decarbonized and more resilient economy

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.880
is legally binding.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.496
And here's the more important part:

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.936
What did we have before?

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.016
A very small handful of countries

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.280
who had undertaken very reduced,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.376
short-term emission reduction commitments

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.576
that were completely insufficient

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.016
and furthermore,
largely perceived as a burden.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.456
Now what do we have?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:16.056
Now we have all countries of the world
contributing with different intensities

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.376
from different approaches
in different sectors,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.880
but all of them
contributing to a common goal

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.496
and along a path

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.560
with environmental integrity.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.456
Well, once you have all of this in place

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.696
and you have shifted this understanding,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.096
then you see that governments
were able to go to Paris

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.656
and adopt the Paris agreement.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.320
(Applause)

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.560
So,

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.800
as I look back

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.560
over the past six years,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.480
first I remember

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.080
the day the Paris agreement was adopted.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.376
I cannot tell you
the euphoria in the room.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.776
5,000 people jumping out of their seats,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.456
crying, clapping, screaming, yelling,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.776
torn between euphoria and still disbelief
at what they had just seen,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.640
because so many people

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.120
had worked for years towards this,
and this was finally their reality.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.720
And it wasn't just those
who had participated directly.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.376
A few weeks ago, I was with a colleague

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.216
who was trying to decide

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.440
on a Tahitian pearl that he wanted
to give to his wonderful wife Natasha.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.200
And once he had finally decided
what he was going to buy,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.976
the jeweler said to him,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.816
"You know, you're very lucky
that you're buying this now,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.520
because these pearls could go extinct
very soon because of climate change."

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.776
"But," the jeweler said, "have you heard,

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.576
the governments
have just come to a decision,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.840
and Tahiti could have a chance."

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.016
Well, what a fantastic confirmation

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.056
that perhaps, perhaps here is hope,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.080
here is a possible chance.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.296
I'm the first one to recognize
that we have a lot of work still to do.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.656
We've only just started
our work on climate change.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.376
And in fact, we need to make sure
that we redouble our efforts

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.200
over the next five years
that are the urgent five years.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.496
But I do believe

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.456
that we have come over the past six years

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.680
from the impossible

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.536
to the now unstoppable.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.616
And how did we do that?
By injecting transformational optimism

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.096
that allowed us to go
from confrontation to collaboration,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.416
that allowed us to understand
that national and local interests

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.816
are not necessarily at odds
with global needs,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.555
and that if we understand that,
we can bring them together

00:13:10.579 --> 00:13:12.816
and we can merge them harmoniously.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.576
And as I look forward
to other global issues

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.456
that will require
our attention this century --

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.960
food security, water security,
home security, forced migration --

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.496
I see that we certainly do not know

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.056
how we are going to solve
those problems yet.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.776
But we can take a page
out of what we have done on climate change

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.056
and we can understand

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:45.376
that we have got to reinterpret
the zero-sum mentality.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.376
Because we were trained to believe
that there always are winners and losers,

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.040
and that your loss is my gain.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.736
Well, now that we're in a world

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.696
in which we have reached
planetary boundaries

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.376
and that we are not
just so interconnected,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.816
but increasingly
interdependent on each other,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.000
your loss is no longer my gain.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.240
We're either all losers

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.896
or we all can be winners.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.216
But we are going to have to decide

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.400
between zero and sum.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.896
We're going to have to decide
between zero benefit for all

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.896
or living life as the sum of all of us.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.256
We've done it once. We can do it again.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.496
Thanks.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.948
(Applause)
