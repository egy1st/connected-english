00:00:17.229 --> 00:00:20.688
Amanda Palmer (singing):
Ground Control to Major Tom,

00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:27.863
Ground Control to Major Tom,

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:37.569
Take your protein pills
and put your helmet on.

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:45.309
Al Gore: Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six ...

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:50.316
AP: Ground Control to Major Tom,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.356
AG: Five, Four, Three, Two, One ...
AP: Commencing countdown, engines on.

00:00:58.235 --> 00:01:00.609
Check ignition

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:03.156
and may God's love be with you.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.599
AG: Liftoff.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.654
AP: This is Ground Control to Major Tom,

00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:28.068
You've really made the grade

00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:33.115
And the papers want to know

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:35.647
whose shirts you wear.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.034
Now it's time to leave the capsule

00:01:42.058 --> 00:01:44.101
if you dare.

00:01:46.054 --> 00:01:51.079
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control,

00:01:51.103 --> 00:01:54.702
I'm stepping through the door

00:01:56.281 --> 00:02:02.457
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way

00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:10.515
And the stars look very different today.

00:02:11.847 --> 00:02:18.759
For here am I floating round my tin can.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.314
Far above the world,

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.103
Planet Earth is blue

00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:36.171
and there's nothing I can do."

00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:39.107
(Music)

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:13.997
"Though I'm past 100,000 miles,

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.678
I'm feeling very still,

00:03:19.414 --> 00:03:25.080
and I think my spaceship knows
which way to go.

00:03:27.384 --> 00:03:31.634
Tell my wife I love her very much

00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:34.799
she knows."

00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:40.397
Ground Control to Major Tom,

00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:42.486
your circuit's dead,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.278
there's something wrong.

00:03:44.302 --> 00:03:47.690
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.613
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:55.792
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

00:03:56.812 --> 00:03:57.963
Can you ...

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:04.235
"Here am I floating round my tin can,

00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:10.075
far above the Moon.

00:04:13.277 --> 00:04:16.344
Planet Earth is blue

00:04:16.368 --> 00:04:21.593
and there's nothing I can do.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.030
(Music)

00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:21.695
["I'm not a prophet or a stone-age man,

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.565
just a mortal with the potential
of a superman ...

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:28.764
... I'm living on." 
David Bowie, 1947-2016]
