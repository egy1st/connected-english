WEBVTT

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.096
Periods.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.496
Blood.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.720
Menstruation.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.016
Gross.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.656
Secret.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.880
Hidden.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.600
Why?

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.656
A natural biological process

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.496
that every girl and woman
goes through every month

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.696
for about half of her life.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.416
A phenomenon that is so significant

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.640
that the survival and propagation
of our species depends on it.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.320
Yet we consider it a taboo.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.040
We feel awkward
and shameful talking about it.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.656
When I got my first periods,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.040
I was told to keep it
a secret from others --

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.640
even from my father and brother.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.256
Later when this chapter
appeared in our textbooks,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.616
our biology teacher skipped the subject.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.320
(Laughter)

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.680
You know what I learned from it?

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.520
I learned that it is really
shameful to talk about it.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.736
I learned to be ashamed of my body.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.816
I learned to stay unaware of periods

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.800
in order to stay decent.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.256
Research in various parts of India

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.016
shows that three out of every 10 girls
are not aware of menstruation

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.800
at the time of their first periods.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.016
And in some parts of Rajasthan

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.880
this number is as high as nine
out of 10 girls being unaware of it.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.456
You'd be surprised to know

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.696
that most of the girls
that I have spoken to,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.536
who did not know about periods
at the time of their first menstruation

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.936
thought that they have got blood cancer

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.560
and they're going to die soon.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.696
Menstrual hygiene
is a very important risk factor

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.280
for reproductive tract infections.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.216
But in India, only 12 percent
of girls and women

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.000
have access to hygienic ways
of managing their periods.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.336
If you do the math,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.456
88 percent of girls and women use
unhygienic ways to manage their periods.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.680
I was one of them.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.816
I grew up in a small town
called Garhwa, in Jharkhand,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.960
where even buying a sanitary napkin
is considered shameful.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.895
So when I started getting my periods,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.680
I began with using rags.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.216
After every use
I would wash and reuse them.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.496
But to store them,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.136
I would hide and keep it
in a dark, damp place

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.760
so that nobody finds out
that I'm menstruating.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.136
Due to repeated washing
the rags would become coarse,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
and I would often get rashes
and infections using them.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.160
I wore these already for five years
until I moved out of that town.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.976
Another issue
that periods brought in my life

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.296
those of the social restrictions

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.656
that are imposed upon our girls
and women when they're on their periods.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.976
I think you all must be aware of it,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.960
but I'll still list it
for the few who don't.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.200
I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.696
I was not allowed to sit on the sofa
or some other family member's bed.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.176
I had to wash my bed sheet
after every period,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.136
even if it was not stained.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.976
I was considered impure

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.800
and forbidden from worshipping or touching
any object of religious importance.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.096
You'll find signposts outside temples

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.560
denying the entry
of menstruating girls and women.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.456
Ironically,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.296
most of the time it is the older woman

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.760
who imposes such restrictions
on younger girls in a family.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.536
After all, they have grown up
accepting such restrictions as norms.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.576
And in the absence of any intervention,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.616
it is the myth and misconception

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.240
that propagate
from generation to generation.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.096
During my years of work in this field,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.616
I have even come across stories

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.256
where girls have to eat
and wash their dishes separately.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.616
They're not allowed
to take baths during periods,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.720
and in some households they are even
secluded from other family members.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.256
About 85 percent of girls
and women in India

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.600
would follow one or more restrictive
customs on their periods every month.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.856
Can you imagine what this does

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.840
to the self-esteem
and self-confidence of a young girl?

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.456
The psychological trauma
that this inflicts,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.056
affecting her personality,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.816
her academic performance

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.480
and every single aspect of growing up
during her early formative years?

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.800
I religiously followed all these
restrictive customs for 13 years,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.776
until a discussion with my partner, Tuhin,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.360
changed my perception
about menstruation forever.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.736
In 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing
our postgraduation in design.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.416
We fell in love with each other

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.880
and I was at ease
discussing periods with him.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.560
Tuhin knew little about periods.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.800
(Laughter)

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.416
He was astonished to know
that girls get painful cramps

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.856
and we bleed every month.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.976
(Laughter)

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.496
Yeah.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.296
He was completely shocked to know

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.496
about the restrictions that are imposed
upon menstruating girls and women

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.096
by their own families and their society.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.176
In order to help me with my cramps,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.000
he would go on the Internet
and learn more about menstruation.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.336
When he shared his findings with me,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.360
I realized how little I knew
about menstruation myself.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.080
And many of my beliefs
actually turned out to be myths.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.896
That's when we wondered:

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.256
if we, being so well educated,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.376
were so ill-informed about menstruation,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.400
there would be millions of girls out there
who would be ill-informed, too.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.976
To study --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.776
to understand the problem better,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.416
I undertook a year-long research to study
the lack of awareness about menstruation

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.040
and the root cause behind it.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.696
While it is generally believed

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.696
that menstrual unawareness
and misconception is a rural phenomenon,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.936
during my research,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.936
I found that it is as much
an urban phenomenon as well.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.320
And it exists with the educated
urban class, also.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.776
While talking to many
parents and teachers,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.096
I found that many of them actually
wanted to educate girls about periods

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.760
before they have started
getting their menstrual cycle.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.056
And --

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.616
but they lacked
the proper means themselves.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.896
And since it is a taboo,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.960
they feel inhibition
and shameful in talking about it.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.456
Girls nowadays get their periods
in classes six and seven,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.096
but our educational curriculum

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.920
teaches girls about periods
only in standard eight and nine.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.360
And since it is a taboo,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.440
teachers still
skip the subject altogether.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.096
So school does not
teach girls about periods,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.256
parents don't talk about it.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.680
Where do the girls go?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.520
Two decades ago and now --

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.400
nothing has changed.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.940
I shared these finding with Tuhin
and we wondered:

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.576
What if we could create something

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.176
that would help girls understand
about menstruation on their own --

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.416
something that would help
parents and teachers

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.360
talk about periods
comfortably to young girls?

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.456
During my research,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.456
I was collecting a lot of stories.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.160
These were stories of experiences
of girls during their periods.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.056
These stories would make girls
curious and interested

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.016
in talking about menstruation
in their close circle.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.496
That's what we wanted.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.856
We wanted something
that would make the girls curious

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.056
and drive them to learn about it.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.240
We wanted to use these stories
to teach girls about periods.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.456
So we decided to create a comic book,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.736
where the cartoon characters
would enact these stories

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.640
and educate girls about menstruation
in a fun and engaging way.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.376
To represent girls
in their different phases of puberty,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.040
we have three characters.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.736
Pinki, who has not gotten her period yet,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.256
Jiya who gets her period
during the narrative of the book

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.536
and Mira who has already
been getting her period.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.976
There is a fourth character, Priya Didi.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.536
Through her, girls come to know
about the various aspects of growing up

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.360
and menstrual hygiene management.

00:08:20.455 --> 00:08:22.398
While making the book, we took great care

00:08:22.423 --> 00:08:26.376
that none of the illustrations
were objectionable in any way

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.360
and that it is culturally sensitive.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.056
During our prototype testing,
we found that the girls loved the book.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.456
They were keen on reading it

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.240
and knowing more and more
about periods on their own.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.056
Parents and teachers were
comfortable in talking about periods

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.775
to young girls using the book,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.776
and sometimes even boys
were interested in reading it.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.936
(Laughter)

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.720
(Applause)

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.656
The comic book helped
in creating an environment

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.120
where menstruation ceased to be a taboo.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.776
Many of the volunteers took this prototype
themselves to educate girls

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.736
and take menstrual awareness workshops
in five different states in India.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.136
And one of the volunteers
took this prototype to educate young monks

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.376
and took it to this monastery in Ladakh.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.736
We made the final version of the book,
called "Menstrupedia Comic"

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.520
and launched in September last year.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.496
And so far,

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.856
more than 4,000 girls have been
educated by using the book in India and --

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.536
(Applause)

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.776
Thank you.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.120
(Applause)

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.040
And 10 different countries.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.176
We are constantly translating the book
into different languages

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.936
and collaborating with local organizations

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.616
to make this book available
in different countries.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.576
15 schools in different parts of India

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.016
have made this book
a part of their school curriculum

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.816
to teach girls about menstruation.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.240
(Applause)

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.776
I am amazed to see how volunteers,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.936
individuals, parents,
teachers, school principals,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.456
have come together

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.736
and taken this menstrual awareness
drive to their own communities,

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.456
have made sure that the girls
learn about periods at the right age

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.640
and helped in breaking this taboo.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.336
I dream of a future
where menstruation is not a curse,

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.896
not a disease,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.360
but a welcoming change in a girl's life.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.336
And I would --

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.480
(Applause)

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.336
And I would like to end this

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.256
with a small request
to all the parents here.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.480
Dear parents,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.456
if you would be ashamed of periods,

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.696
your daughters would be, too.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.176
So please be period positive.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.416
(Laughter)

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.656
Thank you.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.403
(Applause)
