00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:03.087
How do you find a dinosaur?

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:05.753
Sounds impossible, doesn't it?

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.945
It's not.

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:12.195
And the answer relies on a formula
that all paleontologists use.

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:14.674
And I'm going to tell you the secret.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.290
First, find rocks of the right age.

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:23.320
Second, those rocks
must be sedimentary rocks.

00:00:23.863 --> 00:00:28.303
And third, layers of those rocks
must be naturally exposed.

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:29.919
That's it.

00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:33.354
Find those three things
and get yourself on the ground,

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:35.783
chances are good
that you will find fossils.

00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:38.403
Now let me break down this formula.

00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:43.183
Organisms exist only during certain
geological intervals.

00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:45.637
So you have to find
rocks of the right age,

00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.829
depending on what your interests are.

00:00:47.853 --> 00:00:49.363
If you want to find trilobites,

00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:52.538
you have to find the really,
really old rocks of the Paleozoic --

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:55.867
rocks between a half a billion
and a quarter-billion years old.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.394
Now, if you want to find dinosaurs,

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:00.775
don't look in the Paleozoic,
you won't find them.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.280
They hadn't evolved yet.

00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:05.391
You have to find the younger
rocks of the Mesozoic,

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:06.812
and in the case of dinosaurs,

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:10.561
between 235 and 66 million years ago.

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:14.670
Now, it's fairly easy to find rocks
of the right age at this point,

00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:17.826
because the Earth is, to a coarse degree,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.180
geologically mapped.

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:21.761
This is hard-won information.

00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:25.127
The annals of Earth history
are written in rocks,

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.452
one chapter upon the next,

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:29.080
such that the oldest pages are on bottom

00:01:29.104 --> 00:01:30.758
and the youngest on top.

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:35.636
Now, were it quite that easy,
geologists would rejoice.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.918
It's not.

00:01:36.942 --> 00:01:38.996
The library of Earth is an old one.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.659
It has no librarian to impose order.

00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:45.241
Operating over vast swaths of time,

00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:49.398
myriad geological processes
offer every possible insult

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:51.505
to the rocks of ages.

00:01:52.277 --> 00:01:54.946
Most pages are destroyed
soon after being written.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.162
Some pages are overwritten,

00:01:57.186 --> 00:02:01.756
creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests
of long-gone landscapes.

00:02:02.384 --> 00:02:06.525
Pages that do find sanctuary
under the advancing sands of time

00:02:07.173 --> 00:02:08.768
are never truly safe.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.754
Unlike the Moon --
our dead, rocky companion --

00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:16.418
the Earth is alive, pulsing
with creative and destructive forces

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:18.893
that power its geological metabolism.

00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:22.237
Lunar rocks brought back
by the Apollo astronauts

00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:25.228
all date back to about the age
of the Solar System.

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.849
Moon rocks are forever.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.086
Earth rocks, on the other hand,
face the perils of a living lithosphere.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.694
All will suffer ruination,

00:02:34.718 --> 00:02:37.544
through some combination
of mutilation, compression,

00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:40.074
folding, tearing, scorching and baking.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.192
Thus, the volumes of Earth history
are incomplete and disheveled.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.694
The library is vast and magnificent --

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:53.258
but decrepit.

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:57.139
And it was this tattered complexity
in the rock record

00:02:57.163 --> 00:03:00.194
that obscured its meaning
until relatively recently.

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:03.357
Nature provided no card catalog
for geologists --

00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:05.094
this would have to be invented.

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.710
Five thousand years after the Sumerians
learned to record their thoughts

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:10.886
on clay tablets,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.993
the Earth's volumes remained
inscrutable to humans.

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:16.959
We were geologically illiterate,

00:03:17.637 --> 00:03:20.819
unaware of the antiquity
of our own planet

00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:22.352
and ignorant of our connection

00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:23.573
to deep time.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.216
It wasn't until the turn
of the 19th century

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.636
that our blinders were removed,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.054
first, with the publication
of James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth,"

00:03:35.078 --> 00:03:38.950
in which he told us that the Earth
reveals no vestige of a beginning

00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:40.752
and no prospect of an end;

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:45.491
and then, with the printing
of William Smith's map of Britain,

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:47.700
the first country-scale geological map,

00:03:47.724 --> 00:03:49.090
giving us for the first time

00:03:49.114 --> 00:03:53.042
predictive insight into where
certain types of rocks might occur.

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:55.527
After that, you could say things like,

00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:58.554
"If we go over there,
we should be in the Jurassic,"

00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:02.329
or, "If we go up over that hill,
we should find the Cretaceous."

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.984
So now, if you want to find trilobites,

00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:08.137
get yourself a good geological map

00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:10.412
and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic.

00:04:11.023 --> 00:04:13.342
If you want to find dinosaurs like I do,

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:16.420
find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there.

00:04:17.217 --> 00:04:20.316
Now of course, you can only make
a fossil in a sedimentary rock,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.989
a rock made by sand and mud.

00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:23.656
You can't have a fossil

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.004
in an igneous rock formed
by magma, like a granite,

00:04:27.028 --> 00:04:30.090
or in a metamorphic rock
that's been heated and squeezed.

00:04:30.773 --> 00:04:32.908
And you have to get yourself in a desert.

00:04:33.378 --> 00:04:36.459
It's not that dinosaurs
particularly lived in deserts;

00:04:36.483 --> 00:04:38.047
they lived on every land mass

00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:40.128
and in every imaginable environment.

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:43.541
It's that you need to go to a place
that's a desert today,

00:04:43.565 --> 00:04:46.739
a place that doesn't have
too many plants covering up the rocks,

00:04:46.763 --> 00:04:50.643
and a place where erosion is always
exposing new bones at the surface.

00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:52.835
So find those three things:

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.414
rocks of the right age,

00:04:54.438 --> 00:04:57.487
that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert,

00:04:57.511 --> 00:04:59.068
and get yourself on the ground,

00:04:59.092 --> 00:05:00.604
and you literally walk

00:05:00.628 --> 00:05:03.216
until you see a bone
sticking out of the rock.

00:05:04.562 --> 00:05:07.664
Here's a picture that I took
in Southern Patagonia.

00:05:08.347 --> 00:05:11.109
Every pebble that you see
on the ground there

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:12.656
is a piece of dinosaur bone.

00:05:13.478 --> 00:05:15.344
So when you're in that right situation,

00:05:15.368 --> 00:05:18.122
it's not a question of whether
you'll find fossils or not;

00:05:18.146 --> 00:05:19.535
you're going to find fossils.

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:23.607
The question is: Will you find something
that is scientifically significant?

00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:27.601
And to help with that, I'm going to add
a fourth part to our formula,

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:28.802
which is this:

00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:32.891
get as far away from other
paleontologists as possible.

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:34.886
(Laughter)

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.265
It's not that I don't like
other paleontologists.

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.814
When you go to a place
that's relatively unexplored,

00:05:39.838 --> 00:05:42.652
you have a much better chance
of not only finding fossils

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.185
but of finding something
that's new to science.

00:05:45.788 --> 00:05:47.899
So that's my formula
for finding dinosaurs,

00:05:47.923 --> 00:05:49.956
and I've applied it all around the world.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.308
In the austral summer of 2004,

00:05:52.332 --> 00:05:54.157
I went to the bottom of South America,

00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:56.298
to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina,

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.575
to prospect for dinosaurs:

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.972
a place that had terrestrial
sedimentary rocks of the right age,

00:06:01.996 --> 00:06:03.199
in a desert,

00:06:03.223 --> 00:06:06.485
a place that had been barely visited
by paleontologists.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:08.469
And we found this.

00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:11.319
This is a femur, a thigh bone,

00:06:11.343 --> 00:06:13.712
of a giant, plant-eating dinosaur.

00:06:13.736 --> 00:06:16.570
That bone is 2.2 meters across.

00:06:16.594 --> 00:06:18.683
That's over seven feet long.

00:06:19.807 --> 00:06:21.907
Now, unfortunately,
that bone was isolated.

00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:24.970
We dug and dug and dug,
and there wasn't another bone around.

00:06:24.994 --> 00:06:27.689
But it made us hungry to go back
the next year for more.

00:06:27.713 --> 00:06:30.316
And on the first day
of that next field season,

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.709
I found this: another two-meter femur,

00:06:33.733 --> 00:06:35.376
only this time not isolated,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.495
this time associated with 145 other bones

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:40.319
of a giant plant eater.

00:06:41.064 --> 00:06:45.160
And after three more hard,
really brutal field seasons,

00:06:45.184 --> 00:06:47.136
the quarry came to look like this.

00:06:47.597 --> 00:06:51.715
And there you see the tail
of that great beast wrapping around me.

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:55.291
The giant that lay in this grave,
the new species of dinosaur,

00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:59.013
we would eventually call
"Dreadnoughtus schrani."

00:06:59.513 --> 00:07:02.509
Dreadnoughtus was 85 feet
from snout to tail.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.708
It stood two-and-a-half stories
at the shoulder,

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:10.401
and all fleshed out in life,
it weighed 65 tons.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.872
People ask me sometimes,
"Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?"

00:07:14.896 --> 00:07:17.680
That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.709
Now, one of the really cool things
about being a paleontologist

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.502
is when you find a new species,
you get to name it.

00:07:24.526 --> 00:07:28.360
And I've always thought it a shame
that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs

00:07:28.384 --> 00:07:32.863
are too often portrayed as passive,
lumbering platters of meat

00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:34.132
on the landscape.

00:07:34.156 --> 00:07:35.282
(Laughter)

00:07:35.585 --> 00:07:36.884
They're not.

00:07:36.908 --> 00:07:39.927
Big herbivores can be surly,
and they can be territorial --

00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:44.474
you do not want to mess with a hippo
or a rhino or a water buffalo.

00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:49.822
The bison in Yellowstone injure
far more people than do the grizzly bears.

00:07:49.846 --> 00:07:54.987
So can you imagine a big bull,
65-ton Dreadnoughtus

00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:56.714
in the breeding season,

00:07:56.738 --> 00:07:58.238
defending a territory?

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.310
That animal would have been
incredibly dangerous,

00:08:01.334 --> 00:08:06.055
a menace to all around, and itself
would have had nothing to fear.

00:08:06.507 --> 00:08:08.732
And thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus,"

00:08:08.756 --> 00:08:10.457
or, "fears nothing."

00:08:12.047 --> 00:08:13.213
Now, to grow so large,

00:08:13.237 --> 00:08:15.849
an animal like Dreadnoughtus
would've had to have been

00:08:15.873 --> 00:08:17.030
a model of efficiency.

00:08:17.054 --> 00:08:20.817
That long neck and long tail help it
radiate heat into the environment,

00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:23.379
passively controlling its temperature.

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:26.908
And that long neck also serves
as a super-efficient feeding mechanism.

00:08:26.932 --> 00:08:29.712
Dreadnoughtus could stand
in one place and with that neck

00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:32.028
clear out a huge envelope of vegetation,

00:08:32.052 --> 00:08:35.966
taking in tens of thousands of calories
while expending very few.

00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:40.921
And these animals evolved
a bulldog-like wide-gait stance,

00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:42.760
giving them immense stability,

00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:47.701
because when you're 65 tons,
when you're literally as big as a house,

00:08:47.725 --> 00:08:49.832
the penalty for falling over

00:08:49.856 --> 00:08:51.013
is death.

00:08:51.677 --> 00:08:53.582
Yeah, these animals are big and tough,

00:08:53.606 --> 00:08:55.383
but they won't take a blow like that.

00:08:55.407 --> 00:08:57.988
Dreadnoughtus falls over,
ribs break and pierce lungs.

00:08:58.012 --> 00:08:59.537
Organs burst.

00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:01.347
If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus,

00:09:01.371 --> 00:09:03.948
you don't get to fall down
in life -- even once.

00:09:05.664 --> 00:09:09.230
Now, after this particular
Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried

00:09:09.254 --> 00:09:13.974
and de-fleshed by a multitude
of bacteria, worms and insects,

00:09:13.998 --> 00:09:16.163
its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis,

00:09:16.187 --> 00:09:18.203
exchanging molecules with the groundwater

00:09:18.227 --> 00:09:20.845
and becoming more and more
like the entombing rock.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.979
As layer upon layer
of sediment accumulated,

00:09:24.003 --> 00:09:26.829
pressure from all sides
weighed in like a stony glove

00:09:26.853 --> 00:09:32.478
whose firm and enduring grip held
each bone in a stabilizing embrace.

00:09:33.654 --> 00:09:35.304
And then came the long ...

00:09:36.044 --> 00:09:37.273
nothing.

00:09:37.868 --> 00:09:41.186
Epoch after epoch of sameness,

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.154
nonevents without number.

00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:46.923
All the while, the skeleton lay
everlasting and unchanging

00:09:46.947 --> 00:09:49.310
in perfect equilibrium

00:09:49.334 --> 00:09:51.047
within its rocky grave.

00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:54.012
Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above.

00:09:54.036 --> 00:09:56.683
The dinosaurs would reign
for another 12 million years

00:09:56.707 --> 00:10:00.971
before their hegemony was snuffed out
in a fiery apocalypse.

00:10:01.542 --> 00:10:04.220
The continents drifted. The mammals rose.

00:10:04.244 --> 00:10:05.615
The Ice Age came.

00:10:06.623 --> 00:10:08.870
And then, in East Africa,

00:10:08.894 --> 00:10:14.506
an unpromising species of ape
evolved the odd trick of sentient thought.

00:10:15.752 --> 00:10:19.204
These brainy primates were not
particularly fast or strong.

00:10:20.062 --> 00:10:22.268
But they excelled at covering ground,

00:10:22.292 --> 00:10:24.161
and in a remarkable diaspora

00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:27.327
surpassing even the dinosaurs' record
of territorial conquest,

00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:29.281
they dispersed across the planet,

00:10:29.305 --> 00:10:32.485
ravishing every ecosystem
they encountered,

00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:35.690
along the way, inventing culture
and metalworking and painting

00:10:35.714 --> 00:10:37.056
and dance and music

00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:39.000
and science

00:10:39.793 --> 00:10:44.322
and rocket ships that would eventually
take 12 particularly excellent apes

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:46.197
to the surface of the Moon.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.539
With seven billion peripatetic
Homo sapiens on the planet,

00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:54.470
it was perhaps inevitable

00:10:54.494 --> 00:10:58.532
that one of them would eventually
trod on the grave of the magnificent titan

00:10:58.556 --> 00:11:01.508
buried beneath the badlands
of Southern Patagonia.

00:11:02.614 --> 00:11:03.865
I was that ape.

00:11:05.038 --> 00:11:07.981
And standing there, alone in the desert,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.791
it was not lost on me

00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:13.445
that the chance of any one individual
entering the fossil record

00:11:13.469 --> 00:11:15.142
is vanishingly small.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:18.087
But the Earth is very, very old.

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:22.371
And over vast tracts of time,
the improbable becomes the probable.

00:11:22.395 --> 00:11:25.086
That's the magic of the geological record.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.292
Thus, multitudinous creatures
living and dying on an old planet

00:11:28.316 --> 00:11:30.243
leave behind immense numbers of fossils,

00:11:30.267 --> 00:11:31.909
each one a small miracle,

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:35.224
but collectively, inevitable.

00:11:36.572 --> 00:11:39.445
Sixty-six million years ago,
an asteroid hits the Earth

00:11:39.953 --> 00:11:41.636
and wipes out the dinosaurs.

00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:44.699
This easily might not have been.

00:11:45.312 --> 00:11:48.167
But we only get one history,
and it's the one that we have.

00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:50.467
But this particular reality
was not inevitable.

00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:53.293
The tiniest perturbation
of that asteroid far from Earth

00:11:53.317 --> 00:11:56.318
would have caused it to miss
our planet by a wide margin.

00:11:56.754 --> 00:12:00.107
The pivotal, calamitous day during which
the dinosaurs were wiped out,

00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:03.342
setting the stage
for the modern world as we know it

00:12:03.366 --> 00:12:04.898
didn't have to be.

00:12:04.922 --> 00:12:06.887
It could've just been another day --

00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:08.784
a Thursday, perhaps --

00:12:09.856 --> 00:12:14.783
among the 63 billion days
already enjoyed by the dinosaurs.

00:12:15.313 --> 00:12:16.698
But over geological time,

00:12:16.722 --> 00:12:19.607
improbable, nearly impossible events

00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:20.782
do occur.

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:23.729
Along the path from our wormy,
Cambrian ancestors

00:12:23.753 --> 00:12:26.156
to primates dressed in suits,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:31.061
innumerable forks in the road
led us to this very particular reality.

00:12:31.982 --> 00:12:36.074
The bones of Dreadnoughtus
lay underground for 77 million years.

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:38.070
Who could have imagined

00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:41.058
that a single species of shrew-like mammal

00:12:41.082 --> 00:12:43.126
living in the cracks of the dinosaur world

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.202
would evolve into sentient beings

00:12:45.226 --> 00:12:47.582
capable of characterizing
and understanding

00:12:47.606 --> 00:12:50.613
the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?

00:12:52.775 --> 00:12:55.798
I once stood at the head
of the Missouri River

00:12:57.107 --> 00:12:58.488
and bestraddled it.

00:12:59.123 --> 00:13:01.325
There, it's nothing more
than a gurgle of water

00:13:01.349 --> 00:13:05.960
that issues forth from beneath a rock
in a boulder in a pasture,

00:13:05.984 --> 00:13:07.681
high in the Bitterroot Mountains.

00:13:08.165 --> 00:13:10.557
The stream next to it
runs a few hundred yards

00:13:11.407 --> 00:13:12.859
and ends in a small pond.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.867
Those two streams -- they look identical.

00:13:17.732 --> 00:13:20.271
But one is an anonymous trickle of water,

00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:22.564
and the other is the Missouri River.

00:13:23.667 --> 00:13:27.164
Now go down to the mouth
of the Missouri, near St. Louis,

00:13:27.188 --> 00:13:29.905
and it's pretty obvious
that that river is a big deal.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.354
But go up into the Bitterroots
and look at the Missouri,

00:13:33.378 --> 00:13:37.848
and human prospection does not
allow us to see it as anything special.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.984
Now go back to the Cretaceous Period

00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:43.453
and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.

00:13:43.477 --> 00:13:44.914
You would never guess

00:13:44.938 --> 00:13:47.015
that they would amount
to anything special,

00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:48.687
and they probably wouldn't have,

00:13:48.711 --> 00:13:50.948
were it not for that pesky asteroid.

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:55.158
Now, make a thousand more worlds
and a thousand more solar systems

00:13:55.182 --> 00:13:56.468
and let them run.

00:13:57.047 --> 00:13:59.201
You will never get the same result.

00:13:59.225 --> 00:14:02.630
No doubt, those worlds would be
both amazing and amazingly improbable,

00:14:02.654 --> 00:14:05.962
but they would not be our world
and they would not have our history.

00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:08.965
There are an infinite number of histories
that we could've had.

00:14:08.989 --> 00:14:11.515
We only get one, and wow,
did we ever get a good one.

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:14.377
Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.

00:14:15.058 --> 00:14:18.423
Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real.

00:14:19.216 --> 00:14:23.312
Dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle
and pill bugs the length of a car

00:14:23.336 --> 00:14:24.899
really existed.

00:14:27.192 --> 00:14:28.795
Why study the ancient past?

00:14:30.652 --> 00:14:32.319
Because it gives us perspective

00:14:33.065 --> 00:14:34.319
and humility.

00:14:34.977 --> 00:14:38.409
The dinosaurs died in the world's
fifth mass extinction,

00:14:38.433 --> 00:14:42.201
snuffed out in a cosmic accident
through no fault of their own.

00:14:43.114 --> 00:14:46.573
They didn't see it coming,
and they didn't have a choice.

00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:51.475
We, on the other hand, do have a choice.

00:14:51.943 --> 00:14:55.934
And the nature of the fossil record
tells us that our place on this planet

00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.757
is both precarious
and potentially fleeting.

00:14:59.127 --> 00:15:02.895
Right now, our species is propagating
an environmental disaster

00:15:02.919 --> 00:15:06.502
of geological proportions
that is so broad and so severe,

00:15:06.526 --> 00:15:09.151
it can rightly be called
the sixth extinction.

00:15:10.429 --> 00:15:12.245
Only unlike the dinosaurs,

00:15:13.128 --> 00:15:14.619
we can see it coming.

00:15:15.438 --> 00:15:17.111
And unlike the dinosaurs,

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:19.444
we can do something about it.

00:15:20.406 --> 00:15:22.815
That choice is ours.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.641
Thank you.

00:15:24.665 --> 00:15:36.763
(Applause)
