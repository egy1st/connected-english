00:00:00.258 --> 00:00:03.166
Some people think that there's
a TED Talk formula:

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.165
"Give a talk on a round, red rug."

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:06.591
"Share a childhood story."

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:08.622
"Divulge a personal secret."

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:11.417
"End with an inspiring call to action."

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:12.591
No.

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:14.712
That's not how to think of a TED Talk.

00:00:14.736 --> 00:00:16.725
In fact, if you overuse those devices,

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.892
you're just going to come across
as clichÃ©d or emotionally manipulative.

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:24.796
But there is one thing that all
great TED Talks have in common,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.499
and I would like to share
that thing with you,

00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:30.198
because over the past 12 years,
I've had a ringside seat,

00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:34.961
listening to many hundreds
of amazing TED speakers, like these.

00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:37.422
I've helped them prepare
their talks for prime time,

00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:38.882
and learned directly from them

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:41.232
their secrets of what
makes for a great talk.

00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:44.026
And even though these speakers
and their topics all seem

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.201
completely different,

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:48.961
they actually do have
one key common ingredient.

00:00:49.318 --> 00:00:50.547
And it's this:

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:53.865
Your number one task as a speaker

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:58.476
is to transfer into your listeners' minds
an extraordinary gift --

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.079
a strange and beautiful object
that we call an idea.

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:05.369
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:05.393 --> 00:01:06.544
Here's Haley.

00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:08.534
She is about to give a TED Talk

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:10.401
and frankly, she's terrified.

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.074
(Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck!

00:01:12.098 --> 00:01:15.098
(Applause)

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:20.373
Over the course of 18 minutes,

00:01:20.397 --> 00:01:24.361
1,200 people, many of whom
have never seen each other before,

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:28.505
are finding that their brains
are starting to sync with Haley's brain

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:29.967
and with each other.

00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:33.385
They're literally beginning to exhibit
the same brain-wave patterns.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.275
And I don't just mean
they're feeling the same emotions.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.798
There's something even more
startling happening.

00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:41.719
Let's take a look inside
Haley's brain for a moment.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.421
There are billions of interconnected
neurons in an impossible tangle.

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:48.252
But look here, right here --

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:51.037
a few million of them
are linked to each other

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:54.500
in a way which represents a single idea.

00:01:54.524 --> 00:01:58.564
And incredibly, this exact pattern
is being recreated in real time

00:01:58.588 --> 00:02:01.666
inside the minds of everyone listening.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.850
That's right; in just a few minutes,

00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:06.237
a pattern involving millions of neurons

00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:09.046
is being teleported into 1,200 minds,

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.199
just by people listening to a voice
and watching a face.

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:15.491
But wait -- what is an idea anyway?

00:02:15.515 --> 00:02:18.999
Well, you can think of it
as a pattern of information

00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:22.411
that helps you understand
and navigate the world.

00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:24.411
Ideas come in all shapes and sizes,

00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:26.435
from the complex and analytical

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.538
to the simple and aesthetic.

00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:31.435
Here are just a few examples
shared from the TED stage.

00:02:31.816 --> 00:02:35.521
Sir Ken Robinson -- creativity
is key to our kids' future.

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:38.476
(Video) Sir Ken Robinson:
My contention is that creativity now

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.601
is as important in education as literacy,

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.115
and we should treat it
with the same status.

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.259
Chris Anderson: Elora Hardy --
building from bamboo is beautiful.

00:02:47.283 --> 00:02:49.607
(Video) Elora Hardy:
It is growing all around us,

00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:53.791
it's strong, it's elegant,
it's earthquake-resistant.

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:57.656
CA: Chimamanda Adichie --
people are more than a single identity.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.782
(Video) Chimamanda Adichie:
The single story creates stereotypes,

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:05.203
and the problem with stereotypes
is not that they are untrue,

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:07.211
but that they are incomplete.

00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:09.821
CA: Your mind is teeming with ideas,

00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:11.196
and not just randomly.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.426
They're carefully linked together.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.355
Collectively they form
an amazingly complex structure

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.553
that is your personal worldview.

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:20.863
It's your brain's operating system.

00:03:20.887 --> 00:03:22.759
It's how you navigate the world.

00:03:22.783 --> 00:03:26.568
And it is built up out of millions
of individual ideas.

00:03:26.592 --> 00:03:30.061
So, for example, if one little
component of your worldview

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.911
is the idea that kittens are adorable,

00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:35.330
then when you see this,

00:03:35.354 --> 00:03:36.934
you'll react like this.

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.035
But if another component of your worldview

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.322
is the idea that leopards are dangerous,

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.591
then when you see this,

00:03:42.615 --> 00:03:44.876
you'll react a little bit differently.

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:47.112
So, it's pretty obvious

00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:51.049
why the ideas that make up
your worldview are crucial.

00:03:51.073 --> 00:03:54.069
You need them to be as reliable
as possible -- a guide,

00:03:54.093 --> 00:03:57.881
to the scary but wonderful
real world out there.

00:03:57.905 --> 00:04:01.652
Now, different people's worldviews
can be dramatically different.

00:04:02.198 --> 00:04:03.384
For example,

00:04:03.408 --> 00:04:07.246
how does your worldview react
when you see this image:

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.887
(Video) Dalia Mogahed:
What do you think when you look at me?

00:04:10.911 --> 00:04:15.353
"A woman of faith,"
"an expert," maybe even "a sister"?

00:04:16.292 --> 00:04:20.111
Or "oppressed," "brainwashed,"

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.300
"a terrorist"?

00:04:21.955 --> 00:04:23.349
CA: Whatever your answer,

00:04:23.373 --> 00:04:26.770
there are millions of people out there
who would react very differently.

00:04:26.794 --> 00:04:28.870
So that's why ideas really matter.

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:32.572
If communicated properly,
they're capable of changing, forever,

00:04:32.596 --> 00:04:34.645
how someone thinks about the world,

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.054
and shaping their actions both now
and well into the future.

00:04:39.603 --> 00:04:43.484
Ideas are the most powerful force
shaping human culture.

00:04:43.508 --> 00:04:44.659
So if you accept

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:47.413
that your number one task
as a speaker is to build an idea

00:04:47.437 --> 00:04:49.483
inside the minds of your audience,

00:04:49.507 --> 00:04:52.801
here are four guidelines
for how you should go about that task:

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:56.646
One, limit your talk
to just one major idea.

00:04:57.157 --> 00:04:58.990
Ideas are complex things;

00:04:59.014 --> 00:05:02.379
you need to slash back your content
so that you can focus

00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:05.156
on the single idea
you're most passionate about,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.814
and give yourself a chance
to explain that one thing properly.

00:05:08.838 --> 00:05:12.591
You have to give context,
share examples, make it vivid.

00:05:12.615 --> 00:05:13.862
So pick one idea,

00:05:13.886 --> 00:05:17.087
and make it the through-line
running through your entire talk,

00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:20.589
so that everything you say
links back to it in some way.

00:05:21.182 --> 00:05:24.557
Two, give your listeners a reason to care.

00:05:25.523 --> 00:05:29.554
Before you can start building things
inside the minds of your audience,

00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:31.983
you have to get their permission
to welcome you in.

00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:33.840
And the main tool to achieve that?

00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:35.524
Curiosity.

00:05:35.548 --> 00:05:37.796
Stir your audience's curiosity.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.041
Use intriguing, provocative questions

00:05:40.065 --> 00:05:44.246
to identify why something
doesn't make sense and needs explaining.

00:05:44.698 --> 00:05:48.659
If you can reveal a disconnection
in someone's worldview,

00:05:48.683 --> 00:05:52.000
they'll feel the need
to bridge that knowledge gap.

00:05:52.024 --> 00:05:54.063
And once you've sparked that desire,

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:57.371
it will be so much easier
to start building your idea.

00:05:58.032 --> 00:06:01.405
Three, build your idea, piece by piece,

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:05.143
out of concepts that your audience
already understands.

00:06:05.167 --> 00:06:06.814
You use the power of language

00:06:06.838 --> 00:06:09.767
to weave together
concepts that already exist

00:06:09.791 --> 00:06:11.428
in your listeners' minds --

00:06:11.452 --> 00:06:13.746
but not your language, their language.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.206
You start where they are.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.928
The speakers often forget that many
of the terms and concepts they live with

00:06:18.952 --> 00:06:21.563
are completely unfamiliar
to their audiences.

00:06:21.587 --> 00:06:26.761
Now, metaphors can play a crucial role
in showing how the pieces fit together,

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:30.459
because they reveal
the desired shape of the pattern,

00:06:30.483 --> 00:06:33.991
based on an idea that the listener
already understands.

00:06:34.015 --> 00:06:36.000
For example, when Jennifer Kahn

00:06:36.024 --> 00:06:39.673
wanted to explain the incredible
new biotechnology called CRISPR,

00:06:39.697 --> 00:06:41.983
she said, "It's as if, for the first time,

00:06:42.007 --> 00:06:45.038
you had a word processor to edit DNA.

00:06:45.062 --> 00:06:49.689
CRISPR allows you to cut and paste
genetic information really easily."

00:06:50.165 --> 00:06:54.443
Now, a vivid explanation like that
delivers a satisfying aha moment

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:56.800
as it snaps into place in our minds.

00:06:56.824 --> 00:07:00.744
It's important, therefore,
to test your talk on trusted friends,

00:07:00.768 --> 00:07:03.372
and find out which parts
they get confused by.

00:07:03.396 --> 00:07:05.704
Four, here's the final tip:

00:07:05.728 --> 00:07:08.505
Make your idea worth sharing.

00:07:09.242 --> 00:07:11.895
By that I mean, ask yourself the question:

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.737
"Who does this idea benefit?"

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:17.450
And I need you to be honest
with the answer.

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:20.386
If the idea only serves you
or your organization,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.687
then, I'm sorry to say,
it's probably not worth sharing.

00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:25.822
The audience will see right through you.

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:28.528
But if you believe that the idea
has the potential

00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:30.450
to brighten up someone else's day

00:07:30.474 --> 00:07:33.290
or change someone else's
perspective for the better

00:07:33.314 --> 00:07:36.178
or inspire someone to do
something differently,

00:07:36.202 --> 00:07:39.822
then you have the core ingredient
to a truly great talk,

00:07:39.846 --> 00:07:42.976
one that can be a gift to them
and to all of us.
