00:00:00.837 --> 00:00:02.838
How much do you need
to know about a person

00:00:02.862 --> 00:00:05.396
before you'd feel comfortable
making a loan?

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:08.499
Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars

00:00:08.523 --> 00:00:10.837
to the person sitting two rows behind you.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.322
What would you need to know
about that person

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.267
before you'd feel comfortable?

00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:19.215
My mom came to the US from India
in her late thirties.

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:21.046
She's a doctor in Brooklyn,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.293
and she often lets friends and neighbors
come to see her for health services,

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:27.546
whether they can pay right away or not.

00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:31.162
I remember running into her patients
with her at the grocery store

00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:32.337
or on the sidewalk,

00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:35.201
and sometimes they would come
and pay her right on the spot

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:36.583
for previous appointments.

00:00:36.607 --> 00:00:37.846
She would thank them,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.591
and ask them about their families
and their health.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.718
She gave them credit
because she trusted them.

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.489
Most of us are like my mom.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.762
We would give credit to someone we know

00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:52.182
or that we live next to.

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:55.910
But most of us are probably not
going to lend to a stranger

00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:59.000
unless we know a little
something about them.

00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:03.337
Banks, credit card companies
and other financial institutions

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.621
don't know us on a personal level,

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:08.524
but they do have a way of trusting us,

00:01:08.548 --> 00:01:11.009
and that's through our credit scores.

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:13.028
Our credit scores have been created

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:17.572
through an aggregation and analysis
of our public consumer credit data.

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:20.837
And because of them, we have
pretty much easy access

00:01:20.861 --> 00:01:23.305
to all of the goods
and services that we need,

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.173
from getting electricity to buying a home,

00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:28.654
or taking a risk and starting a business.

00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:30.722
But ...

00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:35.113
there are 2.5 billion people
around the world

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:37.223
that don't have a credit score.

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:40.271
That's a third of the world's population.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.185
They don't have a score

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:45.470
because there are no formal
public records on them --

00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:46.858
no bank accounts,

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:48.376
no credit histories

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.458
and no social security numbers.

00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:52.201
And because they don't have a score,

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:56.876
they don't have access
to the credit or financial products

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.746
that can improve their lives.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.571
They are not trusted.

00:02:02.968 --> 00:02:06.138
So we wanted to find a way to build trust

00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:10.213
and to open up financial access
for these 2.5 billion.

00:02:10.772 --> 00:02:13.238
So we created a mobile application

00:02:13.262 --> 00:02:17.552
that builds credit scores for them
using mobile data.

00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:22.801
There are currently over one billion
smartphones in emerging markets.

00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:25.813
And people are using them
the same way that we do.

00:02:26.235 --> 00:02:29.204
They're texting their friends,
they're looking up directions,

00:02:29.228 --> 00:02:30.640
they're browsing the Internet

00:02:30.664 --> 00:02:33.143
and they're even making
financial transactions.

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:36.353
Over time, this data is getting
captured on our phones,

00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:40.172
and it provides a really rich picture
of a person's life.

00:02:41.132 --> 00:02:43.308
Our customers give us access to this data

00:02:43.332 --> 00:02:46.442
and we capture it
through our mobile application.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.110
It helps us understand
the creditworthiness

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:53.835
of people like Jenipher,
a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.173
Jenipher is 65 years old, and for decades
has been running a food stall

00:02:59.197 --> 00:03:01.255
in the central business district.

00:03:01.897 --> 00:03:05.096
She has three sons who she put
through vocational school,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.644
and she's also the leader
of her local chama,

00:03:07.668 --> 00:03:09.131
or savings group.

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.532
Jenipher's food stall does well.

00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:15.000
She makes just enough every day
to cover her expenses.

00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:17.392
But she's not financially secure.

00:03:17.842 --> 00:03:20.582
Any emergency could force her into debt.

00:03:20.887 --> 00:03:22.734
And she has no discretionary income

00:03:22.758 --> 00:03:24.996
to improve her family's way of living,

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.259
for emergencies,

00:03:26.283 --> 00:03:28.956
or for investing
into growing her business.

00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:33.291
If Jenipher wants credit,
her options are limited.

00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:35.111
She could get a microloan,

00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:38.979
but she'd have to form a group
that could help vouch for her credibility.

00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:41.975
And even then, the loan sizes
would be way too small

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.256
to really have an impact on her business,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.568
averaging around 150 dollars.

00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:50.043
Loan sharks are always an option,

00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:54.017
but with interest rates
that are well above 300 percent,

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:55.595
they're financially risky.

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.064
And because Jenipher doesn't have
collateral or a credit history,

00:04:00.088 --> 00:04:03.875
she can't walk into a bank
and ask for a business loan.

00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:05.654
But one day,

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:09.656
Jenipher's son convinced her
to download our application

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.931
and apply for a loan.

00:04:11.407 --> 00:04:13.946
Jenipher answered a few
questions on her phone

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.964
and she gave us access to a few
key data points on her device.

00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:19.899
And here's what we saw.

00:04:20.392 --> 00:04:21.891
So, bad news first.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:27.762
Jenipher had a low savings balance
and no previous loan history.

00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:29.546
These are factors

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.596
that would have thrown up
a red flag to a traditional bank.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.351
But there were other points
in her history that showed us

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:38.706
a much richer picture of her potential.

00:04:39.342 --> 00:04:40.493
So for one,

00:04:40.517 --> 00:04:44.372
we saw that she made regular
phone calls to her family in Uganda.

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.086
Well, it turns out that the data shows

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.844
a four percent increase in repayment

00:04:50.868 --> 00:04:55.604
among people who consistently
communicate with a few close contacts.

00:04:56.657 --> 00:04:57.816
We could also see

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.648
that though she traveled
around a lot throughout the day,

00:05:00.672 --> 00:05:03.403
she actually had pretty
regular travel patterns,

00:05:03.427 --> 00:05:06.562
and she was either at home
or at her food stall.

00:05:07.315 --> 00:05:11.302
And the data shows
a six percent increase in repayment

00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:13.713
among customers who are consistent

00:05:13.737 --> 00:05:16.346
with where they spend most of their time.

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.930
We could also see
that she communicated a lot

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:22.302
with many different people
throughout the day

00:05:22.326 --> 00:05:24.668
and that she had a strong support network.

00:05:25.287 --> 00:05:26.680
Our data shows

00:05:26.704 --> 00:05:31.384
that people who communicate
with more than 58 different contacts

00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:34.309
tend to be more likely
to be good borrowers.

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:35.602
In Jenipher's case,

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:39.669
she communicated
with 89 different individuals,

00:05:39.693 --> 00:05:42.944
which showed a nine percent
increase in her repayment.

00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:47.655
These are just some of the thousands
of different data points

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:50.912
that we look at to understand
a person's creditworthiness.

00:05:51.397 --> 00:05:54.470
And after analyzing all
of these different data points,

00:05:54.494 --> 00:05:56.466
we took the first risk

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.533
and gave Jenipher a loan.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.696
This is data that would not
be found on a paper trail

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.288
or in any formal financial record.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.508
But it proves trust.

00:06:08.193 --> 00:06:10.170
By looking beyond income,

00:06:10.194 --> 00:06:12.351
we can see that people in emerging markets

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:16.044
that may seem risky
and unpredictable on the surface

00:06:16.068 --> 00:06:20.294
are actually willing and have
the capacity to repay.

00:06:21.334 --> 00:06:26.519
Our credit scores have helped us deliver
over 200,000 loans in Kenya

00:06:26.543 --> 00:06:28.140
in just the past year.

00:06:28.164 --> 00:06:31.466
And our repayment rates
are above 90 percent --

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.785
which, by the way, is in line
with traditional bank repayment rates.

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:40.473
With something as simple
as a credit score,

00:06:40.497 --> 00:06:44.012
we're giving people the power
to build their own futures.

00:06:44.647 --> 00:06:47.954
Our customers have used
their loans for family expenses,

00:06:47.978 --> 00:06:49.835
emergencies, travel

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:52.831
and for investing back
into growing their businesses.

00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:57.264
They're now building better
economies and communities

00:06:57.288 --> 00:06:59.612
where more people can succeed.

00:07:00.664 --> 00:07:03.392
Over the past two years
of using our product,

00:07:03.416 --> 00:07:07.600
Jenipher has increased
her savings by 60 percent.

00:07:07.624 --> 00:07:10.276
She's also started
two additional food stalls

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.377
and is now making plans
for her own restaurant.

00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:16.805
She's applying for a small-business loan
from a commercial bank,

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:21.554
because she now has the credit history
to prove she deserves it.

00:07:22.038 --> 00:07:24.953
I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week,

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:28.228
and she told me how excited
she was to get started.

00:07:28.252 --> 00:07:29.540
She said,

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:35.657
"Only my son believed I could do this.
I didn't think this was for me."

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.536
She's lived her whole life

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.853
believing that there was a part
of the world that was closed off to her.

00:07:43.536 --> 00:07:47.892
Our job now is to open
the world to Jenipher

00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:52.111
and the billions like her
that deserve to be trusted.

00:07:52.135 --> 00:07:53.294
Thank you.

00:07:53.318 --> 00:07:57.650
(Applause)
