WEBVTT

00:00:00.884 --> 00:00:02.632
So I'm an artist,

00:00:02.656 --> 00:00:04.362
but a little bit of a peculiar one.

00:00:04.386 --> 00:00:05.869
I don't paint.

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:07.718
I can't draw.

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:11.253
My shop teacher in high school
wrote that I was a menace

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:13.443
on my report card.

00:00:13.953 --> 00:00:17.552
You probably don't really
want to see my photographs.

00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:19.956
But there is one thing I know how to do:

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.639
I know how to program a computer.

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:22.875
I can code.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.172
And people will tell me
that 100 years ago,

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:27.546
folks like me didn't exist,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.660
that it was impossible,

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:32.634
that art made with data is a new thing,

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.800
it's a product of our age,

00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:36.711
it's something that's really important

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.813
to think of as something
that's very "now."

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:40.005
And that's true.

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:44.139
But there is an art form
that's been around for a very long time

00:00:44.163 --> 00:00:46.034
that's really about using information,

00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:48.144
abstract information,

00:00:48.168 --> 00:00:50.707
to make emotionally resonant pieces.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.488
And it's called music.

00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:57.504
We've been making music
for tens of thousands of years, right?

00:00:57.528 --> 00:00:59.488
And if you think about what music is --

00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:02.336
notes and chords and keys
and harmonies and melodies --

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.766
these things are algorithms.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.617
These things are systems

00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:08.025
that are designed to unfold over time,

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.506
to make us feel.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.807
I came to the arts through music.

00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:13.219
I was trained as a composer,

00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:16.525
and about 15 years ago,
I started making pieces

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.084
that were designed to look
at the intersection

00:01:19.108 --> 00:01:21.012
between sound and image,

00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:23.868
to use an image to unveil
a musical structure

00:01:23.892 --> 00:01:26.756
or to use a sound to show you
something interesting

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.780
about something that's usually pictorial.

00:01:28.804 --> 00:01:32.271
So what you're seeing on the screen
is literally being drawn

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:35.237
by the musical structure
of the musicians onstage,

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.793
and there's no accident
that it looks like a plant,

00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:41.156
because the underlying
algorithmic biology of the plant

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.491
is what informed the musical structure
in the first place.

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:47.919
So once you know how to do this,
once you know how to code with media,

00:01:47.943 --> 00:01:50.031
you can do some pretty cool stuff.

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:53.532
This is a project I did
for the Sundance Film Festival.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:57.909
Really simple idea: you take
every Academy Award Best Picture,

00:01:59.178 --> 00:02:01.539
you speed it up to one minute each

00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:03.144
and string them all together.

00:02:03.168 --> 00:02:07.079
And so in 75 minutes, I can show you
the history of Hollywood cinema.

00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:10.571
And what it really shows you
is the history of editing

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:11.776
in Hollywood cinema.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.948
So on the left, we've got Casablanca;
on the right, we've got Chicago.

00:02:15.972 --> 00:02:18.896
And you can see that Casablanca
is a little easier to read.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.252
That's because the average length
of a cinematic shot in the 1940s

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:23.915
was 26 seconds,

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.967
and now it's around six seconds.

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.743
This is a project that was inspired

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:31.711
by some work that was funded
by the US Federal Government

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:32.904
in the early 2000s,

00:02:32.928 --> 00:02:38.756
to look at video footage and find
a specific actor in any video.

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:44.281
And so I repurposed this code
to train a system on one person

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:48.152
in our culture who would never need
to be surveilled in that manner,

00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:49.703
which is Britney Spears.

00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:53.219
I downloaded 2,000 paparazzi
photos of Britney Spears

00:02:53.243 --> 00:02:55.719
and trained my computer to find her face

00:02:55.743 --> 00:02:57.124
and her face alone.

00:02:57.148 --> 00:03:01.424
I can run any footage of her through it
and will center her eyes in the frame,

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:03.624
and this sort of is a little
double commentary

00:03:03.648 --> 00:03:05.672
about surveillance in our society.

00:03:05.696 --> 00:03:08.688
We are very fraught with anxiety
about being watched,

00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:11.311
but then we obsess over celebrity.

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.949
What you're seeing on the screen here
is a collaboration I did

00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:18.529
with an artist named LiÃ¡n Amaris.

00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:22.427
What she did is very simple
to explain and describe,

00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.683
but very hard to do.

00:03:23.707 --> 00:03:26.558
She took 72 minutes of activity,

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:29.781
getting ready for a night out on the town,

00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:31.894
and stretched it over three days

00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:35.506
and performed it on a traffic island
in slow motion in New York City.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.168
I was there, too, with a film crew.

00:03:38.192 --> 00:03:39.444
We filmed the whole thing,

00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:42.869
and then we reversed the process,
speeding it up to 72 minutes again,

00:03:42.893 --> 00:03:44.787
so it looks like she's moving normally

00:03:44.811 --> 00:03:46.643
and the whole world is flying by.

00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:49.667
At a certain point, I figured out

00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:52.358
that what I was doing
was making portraits.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.062
When you think about portraiture,
you tend to think about stuff like this.

00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:59.149
The guy on the left
is named Gilbert Stuart.

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:02.237
He's sort of the first real portraitist
of the United States.

00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:05.486
And on the right is his portrait
of George Washington from 1796.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.708
This is the so-called Lansdowne portrait.

00:04:07.732 --> 00:04:10.972
And if you look at this painting,
there's a lot of symbolism, right?

00:04:10.996 --> 00:04:13.656
We've got a rainbow out the window.
We've got a sword.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.135
We've got a quill on the desk.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.008
All of these things are meant to evoke

00:04:17.032 --> 00:04:19.480
George Washington
as the father of the nation.

00:04:19.832 --> 00:04:22.602
This is my portrait of George Washington.

00:04:23.776 --> 00:04:26.785
And this is an eye chart,

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:28.983
only instead of letters, they're words.

00:04:29.713 --> 00:04:32.415
And what the words are is the 66 words

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.899
in George Washington's
State of the Union addresses

00:04:34.923 --> 00:04:37.294
that he uses more
than any other president.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.222
So "gentlemen" has its own symbolism
and its own rhetoric.

00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:46.838
And it's really kind of significant
that that's the word he used the most.

00:04:46.862 --> 00:04:48.981
This is the eye chart for George W. Bush,

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:51.985
who was president when I made this piece.

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.177
And how you get there,

00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.653
from "gentlemen" to "terror"
in 43 easy steps,

00:04:56.677 --> 00:04:58.737
tells us a lot about American history,

00:04:58.761 --> 00:05:00.348
and gives you a different insight

00:05:00.372 --> 00:05:03.309
than you would have
looking at a series of paintings.

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:07.267
These pieces provide a history lesson
of the United States

00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:09.547
through the political
rhetoric of its leaders.

00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:12.535
Ronald Reagan spent a lot of time
talking about deficits.

00:05:13.135 --> 00:05:14.700
Bill Clinton spent a lot of time

00:05:14.724 --> 00:05:18.008
talking about the century in which
he would no longer be president,

00:05:18.032 --> 00:05:19.643
but maybe his wife would be.

00:05:21.148 --> 00:05:23.784
Lyndon Johnson was the first President

00:05:23.808 --> 00:05:26.990
to give his State of the Union addresses
on prime-time television;

00:05:27.014 --> 00:05:29.354
he began every paragraph
with the word "tonight."

00:05:29.378 --> 00:05:32.044
And Richard Nixon,
or more accurately, his speechwriter,

00:05:32.068 --> 00:05:33.396
a guy named William Safire,

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.468
spent a lot of time
thinking about language

00:05:35.492 --> 00:05:39.425
and making sure that his boss
portrayed a rhetoric of honesty.

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.351
This project is shown
as a series of monolithic sculptures.

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.823
It's an outdoor series of light boxes.

00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:47.277
And it's important to note
that they're to scale,

00:05:47.301 --> 00:05:50.915
so if you stand 20 feet back and you can
read between those two black lines,

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:52.090
you have 20/20 vision.

00:05:52.114 --> 00:05:53.152
(Laughter)

00:05:53.176 --> 00:05:55.481
This is a portrait.
And there's a lot of these.

00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:58.767
There's a lot of ways
to do this with data.

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.411
I started looking for a way

00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:05.140
to think about how I can do
a more democratic form of portraiture,

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:09.395
something that's more about
my country and how it works.

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.220
Every 10 years, we make a census
in the United States.

00:06:13.244 --> 00:06:14.702
We literally count people,

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:18.450
find out who lives where,
what kind of jobs we've got,

00:06:18.474 --> 00:06:19.951
the language we speak at home.

00:06:19.975 --> 00:06:22.546
And this is important stuff --
really important stuff.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.803
But it doesn't really tell us who we are.

00:06:24.827 --> 00:06:27.498
It doesn't tell us about our dreams
and our aspirations.

00:06:27.522 --> 00:06:30.912
And so in 2010, I decided
to make my own census.

00:06:30.936 --> 00:06:34.256
And I started looking for a corpus of data

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.392
that had a lot of descriptions
written by ordinary Americans.

00:06:37.416 --> 00:06:38.567
And it turns out

00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:40.333
that there is such a corpus of data

00:06:40.357 --> 00:06:42.341
that's just sitting there for the taking.

00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:43.691
It's called online dating.

00:06:44.574 --> 00:06:49.520
So in 2010, I joined 21 different
online dating services,

00:06:49.544 --> 00:06:52.644
as a gay man, a straight man,
a gay woman and a straight woman,

00:06:52.668 --> 00:06:54.285
in every zip code in America

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:57.494
and downloaded about
19 million people's dating profiles --

00:06:57.518 --> 00:07:00.750
about 20 percent of the adult population
of the United States.

00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:03.060
I have obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:07:03.084 --> 00:07:06.185
This is going to become
really freaking obvious. Just go with me.

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:07.351
(Laughter)

00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:10.414
So what I did was I sorted
all this stuff by zip code.

00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:13.413
And I looked at word analysis.

00:07:13.437 --> 00:07:16.110
These are some dating profiles from 2010

00:07:16.134 --> 00:07:18.229
with the word "lonely" highlighted.

00:07:18.253 --> 00:07:21.234
If you look at these things
topographically,

00:07:21.258 --> 00:07:24.758
if you imagine dark colors to light colors
are more use of the word,

00:07:24.782 --> 00:07:29.083
you can see that Appalachia
is a pretty lonely place.

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:34.926
You can also see
that Nebraska ain't that funny.

00:07:36.385 --> 00:07:40.040
This is the kinky map,
so what this is showing you

00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:45.136
is that the women in Alaska
need to get together

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.935
with the men in southern New Mexico,

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:48.299
and have a good time.

00:07:48.323 --> 00:07:51.189
And I have this
at a pretty granular level,

00:07:51.213 --> 00:07:54.320
so I can tell you that the men
in the eastern half of Long Island

00:07:54.344 --> 00:07:56.270
are way more interested in being spanked

00:07:56.294 --> 00:07:58.519
than men in the western half
of Long Island.

00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:02.701
This will be your one takeaway
from this whole conference.

00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:05.465
You're going to remember
that fact for, like, 30 years.

00:08:05.489 --> 00:08:08.321
(Laughter)

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.078
When you bring this down
to a cartographic level,

00:08:11.102 --> 00:08:14.556
you can make maps and do the same trick
I was doing with the eye charts.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.397
You can replace the name
of every city in the United States

00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:20.413
with the word people use more
in that city than anywhere else.

00:08:20.437 --> 00:08:23.666
If you've ever dated anyone
from Seattle, this makes perfect sense.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.392
You've got "pretty."
You've got "heartbreak."

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:28.831
You've got "gig." You've got "cigarette."

00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:30.881
They play in a band and they smoke.

00:08:31.604 --> 00:08:33.588
And right above that you can see "email."

00:08:33.612 --> 00:08:34.918
That's Redmond, Washington,

00:08:34.942 --> 00:08:37.537
which is the headquarters
of the Microsoft Corporation.

00:08:37.561 --> 00:08:40.385
Some of these you can guess --
so, Los Angeles is "acting"

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.027
and San Francisco is "gay."

00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:44.043
Some are a little bit more heartbreaking.

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:46.148
In Baton Rouge, they talk
about being curvy;

00:08:46.172 --> 00:08:49.059
downstream in New Orleans,
they still talk about the flood.

00:08:49.083 --> 00:08:51.888
Folks in the American capital
will say they're interesting.

00:08:51.912 --> 00:08:54.689
People in Baltimore, Maryland,
will say they're afraid.

00:08:54.713 --> 00:08:56.250
This is New Jersey.

00:08:56.274 --> 00:08:58.963
I grew up somewhere
between "annoying" and "cynical."

00:08:58.987 --> 00:09:03.226
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.907
And New York City's
number one word is "now,"

00:09:05.931 --> 00:09:09.177
as in, "Now I'm working as a waiter,
but actually I'm an actor."

00:09:09.201 --> 00:09:10.299
(Laughter)

00:09:10.323 --> 00:09:14.618
Or, "Now I'm a professor of engineering
at NYU, but actually I'm an artist."

00:09:14.642 --> 00:09:16.567
If you go upstate, you see "dinosaur."

00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:17.742
That's Syracuse.

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.839
The best place to eat
in Syracuse, New York,

00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:22.657
is a Hell's Angels barbecue joint
called Dinosaur Barbecue.

00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:24.903
That's where you would
take somebody on a date.

00:09:24.927 --> 00:09:28.733
I live somewhere between "unconditional"
and "midsummer," in Midtown Manhattan.

00:09:28.757 --> 00:09:30.804
And this is gentrified North Brooklyn,

00:09:30.828 --> 00:09:34.024
so you've got "DJ" and "glamorous"
and "hipsters" and "urbane."

00:09:34.048 --> 00:09:36.470
So that's maybe
a more democratic portrait.

00:09:36.494 --> 00:09:39.563
And the idea was, what if we made
red-state and blue-state maps

00:09:39.587 --> 00:09:41.756
based on what we want to do
on a Friday night?

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.287
This is a self-portrait.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.027
This is based on my email,

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:48.020
about 500,000 emails sent over 20 years.

00:09:48.044 --> 00:09:50.997
You can think of this
as a quantified selfie.

00:09:51.021 --> 00:09:54.115
So what I'm doing is running
a physics equation

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:55.537
based on my personal data.

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:58.304
You have to imagine everybody
I've ever corresponded with.

00:09:58.328 --> 00:10:01.727
It started out in the middle
and it exploded with a big bang.

00:10:01.751 --> 00:10:03.929
And everybody has gravity to one another,

00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:06.214
gravity based on how much
they've been emailing,

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:07.746
who they've been emailing with.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.602
And it also does sentimental analysis,

00:10:09.626 --> 00:10:11.915
so if I say "I love you,"
you're heavier to me.

00:10:11.939 --> 00:10:14.435
And you attract to my email
addresses in the middle,

00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:16.554
which act like mainline stars.

00:10:16.578 --> 00:10:18.363
And all the names are handwritten.

00:10:18.917 --> 00:10:22.625
Sometimes you do this data
and this work with real-time data

00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:25.596
to illuminate a specific problem
in a specific city.

00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:28.747
This is a Walther PPK 9mm
semiautomatic handgun

00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:31.802
that was used in a shooting
in the French Quarter of New Orleans

00:10:31.826 --> 00:10:35.135
about two years ago on Valentine's Day
in an argument over parking.

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:36.374
Those are my cigarettes.

00:10:36.398 --> 00:10:38.673
This is the house
where the shooting took place.

00:10:38.697 --> 00:10:41.071
This project involved
a little bit of engineering.

00:10:41.095 --> 00:10:43.310
I've got a bike chain
rigged up as a cam shaft,

00:10:43.334 --> 00:10:44.650
with a computer driving it.

00:10:44.674 --> 00:10:47.440
That computer and the mechanism
are buried in a box.

00:10:47.464 --> 00:10:49.678
The gun's on top welded to a steel plate.

00:10:49.702 --> 00:10:52.047
There's a wire going
through to the trigger,

00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:54.262
and the computer in the box is online.

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:57.519
It's listening to the 911 feed
of the New Orleans Police Department,

00:10:57.543 --> 00:11:00.420
so that anytime there's a shooting
reported in New Orleans,

00:11:00.444 --> 00:11:01.445
(Gunshot sound)

00:11:01.469 --> 00:11:02.689
the gun fires.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.650
Now, there's a blank,
so there's no bullet.

00:11:06.008 --> 00:11:08.082
There's big light, big noise

00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:10.428
and most importantly, there's a casing.

00:11:10.452 --> 00:11:12.848
There's about five shootings
a day in New Orleans,

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:15.213
so over the four months
this piece was installed,

00:11:15.237 --> 00:11:16.848
the case filled up with bullets.

00:11:17.642 --> 00:11:21.376
You guys know what this is --
you call this "data visualization."

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:24.567
When you do it right, it's illuminating.

00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:27.027
When you do it wrong, it's anesthetizing.

00:11:27.656 --> 00:11:29.311
It reduces people to numbers.

00:11:29.335 --> 00:11:30.746
So watch out.

00:11:32.654 --> 00:11:34.010
One last piece for you.

00:11:34.466 --> 00:11:37.248
I spent the last summer
as the artist in residence

00:11:37.272 --> 00:11:38.488
for Times Square.

00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:42.575
And Times Square in New York
is literally the crossroads of the world.

00:11:42.599 --> 00:11:44.776
One of the things
people don't notice about it

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.347
is it's the most Instagrammed
place on Earth.

00:11:47.903 --> 00:11:50.785
About every five seconds,
someone commits a selfie

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:51.978
in Times Square.

00:11:52.424 --> 00:11:55.673
That's 17,000 a day, and I have them all.

00:11:55.697 --> 00:11:56.782
(Laughter)

00:11:56.806 --> 00:11:59.098
These are some of them
with their eyes centered.

00:11:59.122 --> 00:12:00.183
Every civilization,

00:12:00.183 --> 00:12:03.108
will use the maximum level
of technology available to make art.

00:12:03.132 --> 00:12:05.940
And it's the responsibility
of the artist to ask questions

00:12:05.964 --> 00:12:07.595
about what that technology means

00:12:07.619 --> 00:12:09.638
and how it reflects our culture.

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:12.148
So I leave you with this:
we're more than numbers.

00:12:12.172 --> 00:12:14.173
We're people, and we have
dreams and ideas.

00:12:14.197 --> 00:12:16.996
And reducing us to statistics
is something that's done

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.271
at our peril.

00:12:18.295 --> 00:12:19.473
Thank you very much.

00:12:19.497 --> 00:12:30.283
(Applause)
