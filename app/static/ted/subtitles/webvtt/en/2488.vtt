00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:03.269
Hello.

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:06.713
This is my first trip,

00:00:06.737 --> 00:00:10.975
first time in life I'm outside
of the walls of Gaza.

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.111
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:19.059
(Applause)

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:24.587
My ambition always was
to be a pilot, to fly a plane,

00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:29.193
to feel free to fly the sky,
to touch the sky.

00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:32.192
But that didn't happen.

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:35.832
Simply, I live in Gaza,
there is no airport.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.244
All borders are closed on every side.

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:44.426
We live in one of the biggest
prisons in the world.

00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:49.648
The only thing I can do
is just to look up to the sky.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.735
On some days, we are lucky
if we have electricity

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.497
for four or five hours.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.164
When it's cold, we make a fire
on the front or on the roof of our homes.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.322
Sometimes we make food, too.

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:11.296
My job in Gaza is to arrange everything
for journalists who come to my homeland

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.548
to tell the stories
about what's going on in Gaza.

00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:19.208
Many mornings,
I had to go to the border area

00:01:19.232 --> 00:01:20.880
to collect a journalist.

00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:24.165
If anything should happen
to the journalist,

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.610
or if the journalist decides
to cover a story

00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:31.332
the government doesn't want us to cover,

00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:33.093
bad things could happen.

00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:37.986
Navigating through my country
helping journalists,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.622
filmmakers, news crews,
is my working life.

00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:48.045
I believe my success comes
from building a relationship

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.340
not only with journalists
and the news crews,

00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:54.481
but also with the communities
in the Gaza Strip.

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:59.135
These communities who don't want
their stories to be told,

00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:03.718
I never looked to them
as stories or numbers.

00:02:03.742 --> 00:02:06.951
But like me, they are human beings.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:14.108
I have built up
many relationships over 10 years.

00:02:14.582 --> 00:02:15.783
And guess what?

00:02:16.134 --> 00:02:19.601
This gives me the chance
to get access to people,

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:21.894
to stories that others can't.

00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:27.587
In some certain situations,
I feel, as a woman, I have more power.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.049
Many male journalists in my society,

00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:36.350
they want to cover a story
about drug addiction in my country.

00:02:36.692 --> 00:02:41.390
That problem started
when the Gaza tunnel was being built.

00:02:42.406 --> 00:02:44.593
With the siege on Gaza,

00:02:44.617 --> 00:02:47.252
tunnels brought people all the basic needs

00:02:47.276 --> 00:02:50.764
like food, building material,
other stuff we needed.

00:02:50.788 --> 00:02:55.574
But not anymore, because the Egyptian side
flooded them up with water

00:02:55.598 --> 00:02:57.795
and they are not working anymore.

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.501
Drugs were being smuggled,

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:03.795
and many young people got addicted, too.

00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:08.063
In the tradition
of the Palestinian society,

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:11.699
it's forbidden for men
to enter the household.

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:15.394
So, no male journalists get the story.

00:03:15.418 --> 00:03:16.632
But I did.

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.844
I have a wonderful husband,

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.670
a wonderful husband who supports me

00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:28.479
despite all the criticism
he gets from the society.

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:31.552
He's at home now with my two kids,

00:03:31.576 --> 00:03:34.266
and I have another one
that's growing in here.

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:40.044
(Applause)

00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:43.939
When I'm working,
I call him every two hours,

00:03:43.963 --> 00:03:47.753
and he knows if he doesn't hear from me,

00:03:47.777 --> 00:03:49.204
he should call my contact,

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:52.390
the one who gives me access to the story,

00:03:52.414 --> 00:03:55.004
which is the one who I trust.

00:03:57.105 --> 00:03:59.130
One of the times in Gaza,

00:03:59.154 --> 00:04:04.093
during the kidnapping
of the British journalist Alan Johnston,

00:04:04.117 --> 00:04:08.016
I was asked by an American magazine

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.942
to set up a meeting
with the kidnappers in Gaza, and I did.

00:04:14.014 --> 00:04:17.323
The journalist covering the story and I

00:04:17.347 --> 00:04:20.376
were asked to meet outside of his hotel.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:26.738
They came, they picked us up
in a black van with black windows,

00:04:26.762 --> 00:04:29.463
they were wearing masks on that day.

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:36.947
And they drove us away,
far away in the middle of a field.

00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:39.431
They took our cell phones

00:04:39.455 --> 00:04:44.375
and we did the interview
with the kidnapper outside in that field.

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.359
I was so scared that day,

00:04:47.383 --> 00:04:49.906
a day I will never forget.

00:04:51.694 --> 00:04:54.514
So, why do I do what I do?

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:58.363
I do it because I believe if I didn't,

00:04:58.387 --> 00:05:02.942
a huge part of the story
about Gaza will be missing.

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:08.126
There are some more stories
I could tell you about my country.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.426
And not all of them are bad.

00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:15.564
I love my country, despite
the terrible situation we live in --

00:05:15.588 --> 00:05:19.507
siege, poverty, unemployment --

00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:20.900
but there is life.

00:05:21.644 --> 00:05:27.210
There are people who are dreamers
and amazing people full of energy.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.105
We have wonderful music,
and a great music school.

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.309
We have parkour dancers
who dance in the rubble of their homes.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.898
And Gaza is the only place
in the Arab world

00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:45.317
where Muslims and Christians
live in strong brotherhood.

00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:51.660
(Applause)

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.232
During the time of war,

00:05:53.256 --> 00:05:57.328
the hardest part for me
is leaving the house early in the morning,

00:05:57.352 --> 00:05:59.022
leaving my children.

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:03.379
I take a picture of them everyday

00:06:03.403 --> 00:06:06.680
because I never know
if I will make it back to them.

00:06:08.364 --> 00:06:13.817
Being a fixer and a journalist
is difficult and dangerous in Gaza.

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.211
But when I hear the sound of the shelling
or the sound of the bombing,

00:06:18.235 --> 00:06:21.173
I just head straight toward it,

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:25.173
because I want to be there first,

00:06:25.197 --> 00:06:29.094
because these stories should be told.

00:06:31.603 --> 00:06:36.352
When my children were small
and we heard the sound of the war,

00:06:36.376 --> 00:06:40.214
I used to tell them
that they were fireworks.

00:06:40.238 --> 00:06:43.336
Now they are older, they understand.

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:47.660
I do have terrible nightmares

00:06:47.684 --> 00:06:51.898
because of all that I witnessed
during war times,

00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:56.177
especially these lifeless bodies
of young children.

00:06:56.201 --> 00:07:00.479
I still remember a little girl,
her name is Hala.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.233
She's the only survivor from her family.

00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:06.878
Her picture will be with me forever.

00:07:06.902 --> 00:07:09.270
I will never forget her.

00:07:12.738 --> 00:07:17.485
I'm proud that I can stand here
and be here today with you.

00:07:18.224 --> 00:07:24.659
I'm proud that I can tell you
stories, sad and happy,

00:07:24.683 --> 00:07:29.161
stories about my small corner
of the world, Gaza.

00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:34.174
I'm proud that I am
the first female fixer working in Gaza.

00:07:34.198 --> 00:07:37.828
And the funny thing is
they call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza.

00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:40.653
(Laughter)

00:07:40.677 --> 00:07:45.626
I hope one day, I will get the chance
to tell the stories of all other women,

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.163
all other amazing women
I know in my country.

00:07:49.187 --> 00:07:53.204
I hope that one day
I can help other women in my country

00:07:53.228 --> 00:07:55.416
to be fixers like me.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.748
And of course sometimes,
I feel I can't do this work anymore,

00:07:59.772 --> 00:08:02.017
it's just too much for me.

00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:04.579
But I remember these words:

00:08:04.603 --> 00:08:08.149
"Don't limit your challenge,
but challenge your limit.

00:08:08.173 --> 00:08:12.243
Don't allow others to stand
in front of your dreams."

00:08:13.502 --> 00:08:14.663
Thank you.

00:08:14.687 --> 00:08:21.687
(Applause)
