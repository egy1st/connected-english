WEBVTT

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.928
Will we do whatever it takes
to tackle climate change?

00:00:07.393 --> 00:00:10.366
I come at this question
not as a green campaigner,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.985
in fact, I confess to be rather
hopeless at recycling.

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:18.669
I come at it as a professional observer
of financial policy making

00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:23.450
and someone that wonders
how history will judge us.

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:25.609
One day,

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:29.498
this ring that belonged to my grandfather

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:31.529
will pass to my son, Charlie.

00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:34.829
And I wonder what his generation

00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:37.159
and perhaps the one that follows

00:00:37.183 --> 00:00:42.021
will make of the two lives
this ring has worked.

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:45.518
My grandfather was a coal miner.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.677
In his time,

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:53.585
burning fossil fuels for energy
and for allowing economies to develop

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:54.766
was accepted.

00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:58.577
We know now that that is not the case

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:01.983
because of the greenhouse
gases that coal produces.

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:04.532
But today,

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:08.602
I fear it's the industry in which I work
that will be judged more harshly

00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:10.662
because of its impact on the climate --

00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:13.845
more harshly than
my grandfather's industry, even.

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:16.888
I work, of course,
in the banking industry,

00:01:16.912 --> 00:01:20.704
which will be remembered
for its crisis in 2008 --

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:26.722
a crisis that diverted the attention
and finances of governments

00:01:26.746 --> 00:01:32.127
away from some really, really
important promises,

00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:37.291
like promises made at the Copenhagen
Climate Summit in 2009

00:01:37.315 --> 00:01:40.147
to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year

00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:44.685
to help developing countries
move away from burning fossil fuels

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:47.688
and transition to using cleaner energy.

00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:51.391
That promise is already in jeopardy.

00:01:51.904 --> 00:01:53.769
And that's a real problem,

00:01:53.793 --> 00:01:56.534
because that transition
to cleaner energy needs to happen

00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:58.470
sooner rather than later.

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:00.340
Firstly,

00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:02.342
because greenhouse gases, once released,

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:05.059
stay in the atmosphere for decades.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.271
And secondly,

00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:12.122
if a developing economy builds
its power grid around fossil fuels today,

00:02:12.146 --> 00:02:15.299
it's going to be way more costly
to change later on.

00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:18.462
So for the climate,

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:22.312
history may judge
that the banking crisis happened

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:24.315
at just the wrong time.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.608
The story need not be this gloomy, though.

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.577
Three years ago,

00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:34.497
I argued that governments
could use the tools

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.206
deployed to save the financial system

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.118
to meet other global challenges.

00:02:39.918 --> 00:02:45.041
And these arguments are getting
stronger, not weaker, with time.

00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:50.746
Let's take a brief reminder
of what those tools looked like.

00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:54.565
When the financial crisis hit in 2008,

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.166
the central banks of the US and UK

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.625
began buying bonds issued
by their own governments

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.948
in a policy known
as "quantitative easing."

00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:07.095
Depending on what happens
to those bonds when they mature,

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.529
this is money printing by another name.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.254
And boy, did they print.

00:03:12.784 --> 00:03:17.352
The US alone created four trillion
dollars' worth of its own currency.

00:03:17.376 --> 00:03:19.465
This was not done in isolation.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.163
In a remarkable act of cooperation,

00:03:22.187 --> 00:03:26.760
the 188 countries that make up
the International Monetary Fund, the IMF,

00:03:26.784 --> 00:03:30.953
agreed to issue 250 billion
dollars' worth of their own currency --

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:33.049
the Special Drawing Right --

00:03:33.073 --> 00:03:35.046
to boost reserves around the world.

00:03:35.712 --> 00:03:38.263
When the financial crisis moved to Europe,

00:03:39.626 --> 00:03:43.067
the European Central Bank
President, Mario Draghi,

00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.855
promised "to do whatever it takes."

00:03:47.516 --> 00:03:48.768
And they did.

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:54.050
The Bank of Japan repeated those words --
that exact same commitment --

00:03:54.074 --> 00:03:58.185
to do "whatever it takes"
to reflate their economy.

00:03:59.484 --> 00:04:01.376
In both cases,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.639
"whatever it takes" meant
trillions of dollars more

00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:08.891
in money-printing policies
that continue today.

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:11.122
What this shows

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:14.912
is that when faced
with some global challenges,

00:04:16.062 --> 00:04:20.707
policy makers are able to act
collectively, with urgency,

00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:26.861
and run the risks of unconventional
policies like money printing.

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.560
So, let's go back
to that original question:

00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:36.355
Can we print money for climate finance?

00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:38.931
Three years ago,

00:04:38.955 --> 00:04:42.690
the idea of using money in this way
was something of a taboo.

00:04:42.714 --> 00:04:45.890
Once you break down and dismantle the idea

00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:47.953
that money is a finite resource,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.063
governments can quickly get overwhelmed
by demands from their people

00:04:53.087 --> 00:04:56.313
to print more and more
money for other causes:

00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:58.337
education, health care, welfare --

00:04:58.361 --> 00:04:59.591
even defense.

00:05:00.384 --> 00:05:05.822
And there are some truly terrible
historical examples of money printing --

00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:08.169
uncontrolled money printing --

00:05:08.193 --> 00:05:09.938
leading to hyperinflation.

00:05:10.764 --> 00:05:14.350
Think: Weimar Republic in 1930;

00:05:14.374 --> 00:05:17.447
Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008,

00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:21.535
when the prices of basic goods
like bread are doubling every day.

00:05:22.892 --> 00:05:27.896
But all of this is moving
the public debate forward,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.248
so much so, that money printing
for the people is now discussed openly

00:05:33.272 --> 00:05:37.486
in the financial media, and even
in some political manifestos.

00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:40.742
But it's important the debate
doesn't stop here,

00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:42.949
with printing national currencies.

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:49.851
Because climate change
is a shared global problem,

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:52.945
there are some really compelling reasons

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.398
why we should be printing
that international currency

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:58.280
that's issued by the IMF,

00:05:58.304 --> 00:05:59.535
to fund it.

00:05:59.944 --> 00:06:03.149
The Special Drawing Right, or SDR,

00:06:03.173 --> 00:06:06.529
is the IMF's electronic unit of account

00:06:06.553 --> 00:06:11.105
that governments use to transfer
funds amongst each other.

00:06:11.933 --> 00:06:14.674
Think of it as a peer-to-peer
payment network,

00:06:14.698 --> 00:06:17.474
like Bitcoin, but for governments.

00:06:18.572 --> 00:06:20.220
And it's truly global.

00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:26.277
Each of the 188 members
of the IMF hold SDR quotas

00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:29.043
as part of their foreign
exchange reserves.

00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:32.223
These are national stores of wealth

00:06:32.247 --> 00:06:35.678
that countries keep to protect
themselves against currency crises.

00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:39.059
And that global nature is why,

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:42.011
at the height of the financial
crisis in 2009,

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.128
the IMF issued those extra
250 billion dollars --

00:06:47.152 --> 00:06:50.723
because it served
as a collective global action

00:06:50.747 --> 00:06:55.554
that safeguarded countries
large and small in one fell swoop.

00:06:57.043 --> 00:06:58.339
But here --

00:06:58.363 --> 00:07:00.029
here's the intriguing part.

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:06.285
More than half of those extra SDRs
that were printed in 2009 --

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.295
150 billion dollars' worth --

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:12.634
went to developed market countries
who, for the most part,

00:07:12.658 --> 00:07:15.495
have a modest need
for these foreign exchange reserves,

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:17.950
because they have flexible exchange rates.

00:07:18.427 --> 00:07:22.808
So those extra reserves
that were printed in 2009,

00:07:22.832 --> 00:07:26.303
in the end, for developed
market countries at least,

00:07:26.327 --> 00:07:27.953
weren't really needed.

00:07:28.508 --> 00:07:30.781
And they remain unused today.

00:07:31.642 --> 00:07:33.002
So here's an idea.

00:07:33.026 --> 00:07:34.398
As a first step,

00:07:35.046 --> 00:07:38.112
why don't we start
spending those unused,

00:07:38.136 --> 00:07:41.603
those extra SDRs
that were printed in 2009,

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.174
to combat climate change?

00:07:43.948 --> 00:07:45.461
They could, for example,

00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:50.185
be used to buy bonds issued
by the UN's Green Climate Fund.

00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:53.797
This was a fund created in 2009,

00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:57.095
following that climate
agreement in Copenhagen.

00:07:57.906 --> 00:08:02.262
And it was designed to channel funds
towards developing countries

00:08:02.286 --> 00:08:04.353
to meet their climate projects.

00:08:04.377 --> 00:08:07.236
It's been one of the most
successful funds of its type,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.564
raising almost 10 billion dollars.

00:08:09.588 --> 00:08:13.026
But if we use those extra
SDRs that were issued,

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.362
it helps governments get back on track,

00:08:16.386 --> 00:08:19.209
to meet that promise
of 100 billion dollars a year

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:21.823
that was derailed by the financial crisis.

00:08:23.766 --> 00:08:25.674
It could also --

00:08:25.698 --> 00:08:28.344
it could also serve as a test case.

00:08:30.096 --> 00:08:35.455
If the inflationary consequences
of using SDRs in this way are benign,

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.429
it could be used to justify

00:08:38.453 --> 00:08:43.187
the additional, extra issuance
of SDRs, say, every five years,

00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:45.606
again, with the commitment

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.060
that developed-market countries
would direct their share

00:08:50.084 --> 00:08:51.545
of the new reserves

00:08:51.569 --> 00:08:53.362
to the Green Climate Fund.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:58.800
Printing international money
in this way has several advantages

00:08:58.824 --> 00:09:00.885
over printing national currencies.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.315
The first is it's really easy to argue

00:09:04.339 --> 00:09:08.756
that spending money to mitigate
climate change benefits everyone.

00:09:09.366 --> 00:09:13.225
No one section of society benefits
from the printing press over another.

00:09:13.249 --> 00:09:17.033
That problem of competing
claims is mitigated.

00:09:17.463 --> 00:09:18.803
It's also fair to say

00:09:18.827 --> 00:09:23.954
that because it takes so many countries
to agree to issue these extra SDRs,

00:09:23.978 --> 00:09:28.181
it's highly unlikely that money printing
would get out of control.

00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:34.025
What you end up with
is a collective, global action

00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:38.212
aimed -- and it's controlled
global action --

00:09:38.236 --> 00:09:40.825
aimed at a global good.

00:09:41.637 --> 00:09:42.845
And,

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:45.436
as we've learned
with the money-printing schemes,

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.292
whatever concerns we have
can be allayed by rules.

00:09:48.757 --> 00:09:50.639
So, for example,

00:09:50.663 --> 00:09:55.636
the issuance of these extra SDRs
every five years could be capped,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:01.255
such that this international currency
is never more than five percent

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:03.241
of global foreign exchange reserves.

00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:05.806
That's important because it would allay

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.726
well, let's say, the ridiculous
concerns that the US might have

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.272
that the SDR could ever challenge
the dollar's dominant role

00:10:14.296 --> 00:10:15.892
in international finance.

00:10:16.214 --> 00:10:17.997
And in fact,

00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:21.415
I think the only thing that the SDR
would likely steal from the dollar

00:10:21.439 --> 00:10:22.908
under this scheme

00:10:22.932 --> 00:10:26.403
is its nickname, the "greenback."

00:10:26.427 --> 00:10:30.343
Because even with that cap in place,

00:10:30.367 --> 00:10:33.831
the IMF could have
followed up its issuance --

00:10:33.855 --> 00:10:36.903
its massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 --

00:10:36.927 --> 00:10:41.919
with a further 200 billion
dollars of SDRs in 2014.

00:10:42.716 --> 00:10:45.050
So hypothetically,

00:10:46.052 --> 00:10:49.170
that would mean that developed countries
could have contributed

00:10:49.194 --> 00:10:53.715
up to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs

00:10:53.739 --> 00:10:55.389
to the Green Climate Fund.

00:10:56.186 --> 00:10:59.646
That's 30 times what it has today.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.826
And you know,

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.691
as spectacular as that sounds,

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.770
it's only just beginning to look
like "whatever it takes."

00:11:09.129 --> 00:11:12.447
And just to think what amazing things
could be done with that money,

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:13.682
consider this:

00:11:14.618 --> 00:11:16.246
in 2009,

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:21.008
Norway promised one billion dollars
of its reserves to Brazil

00:11:21.032 --> 00:11:25.695
if they followed through
on their goals on deforestation.

00:11:26.593 --> 00:11:32.892
That program has since delivered
a 70 percent reduction in deforestation

00:11:32.916 --> 00:11:34.327
in the past decade.

00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:39.264
That's saving 3.2 billion tons
of carbon dioxide emissions,

00:11:39.288 --> 00:11:43.819
which is the equivalent of taking
all American cars off the roads

00:11:43.843 --> 00:11:46.129
for three whole years.

00:11:47.704 --> 00:11:49.006
So what could we do

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:54.074
with 300 other pay-for-performance
climate projects like that,

00:11:54.098 --> 00:11:56.977
organized on a global scale?

00:11:57.937 --> 00:12:00.804
We could take cars off the roads
for a generation.

00:12:01.384 --> 00:12:02.534
So,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.283
let's not quibble about whether we can
afford to fund climate change.

00:12:08.877 --> 00:12:11.125
The real question is:

00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:14.546
Do we care enough about future generations

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.611
to take the very same policy risks
we took to save the financial system?

00:12:20.223 --> 00:12:21.421
After all,

00:12:22.249 --> 00:12:23.468
we could do it,

00:12:24.284 --> 00:12:25.435
we did do it

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:27.190
and we are doing it today.

00:12:27.808 --> 00:12:32.126
We must, must, must do
"whatever it takes."

00:12:33.426 --> 00:12:34.577
Thank you.

00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:38.967
(Applause)
