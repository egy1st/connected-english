00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It is interesting that in the United States,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the most significant health-care budget

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
goes to cardiovascular disease care, whether it's private or public.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There's no comparison at all.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In Africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
17 million people die every year from heart disease.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
32 million heart attacks and strokes occur.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Most of this is in developing countries, and the majority is in Africa.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is in developing countries -- not in the West --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Who is at risk? People like you.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
All friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
should be very concerned about this deplorable situation.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Has anyone here wondered what will happen

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
if you go back to your room at night,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and you start getting chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Will you fly back to the U.S., Germany, Europe?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
No, you will die. 50 percent will die within 24 hours, if not treated.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is what's going on.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
In a look at the map of the U.S. -- the graph here,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
10 million people here, 10 million here.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
By the time you get to 50, it's almost no one left in Nigeria --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
life expectancy is 47.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
they do -- but they do not survive after the time that they reach

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
about 45 years old and 50 years old.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And those are the times they're most productive.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Those are the times that they should be contributing

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to Africa's development. But they're not there.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If you cannot secure the parents,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
you cannot guarantee the security of the African child.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
What are the risk factors?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
These are just for information:

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise. The usual suspects.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Right here in Tanzania, 30 percent of individuals have hypertension.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
20 percent are getting treated.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Only less than one percent are adequately treated.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
If we can treat hypertension alone in Africa,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
we'll save 250,000 lives a year. That's quite significant!

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Easy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In eight short years -- we're here talking about HIV, malaria,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
which is all good.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
In eight short years, non-communicable diseases

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
will become the leading causes of death in Africa.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That is something to keep in mind. We can't deal with it with situations like this.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
This is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
they go to USA, Germany, U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
You can't depend on foreign aid alone.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Here is the situation: countries are turning inwards.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Post-9/11, [the] United States has had a lot of trouble

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
to deal with, their own internal issues.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So, they spend their money trying to fix those problems.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
You can't rightly -- it's not their responsibility,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
it is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
If they help, that's good! But that is not my expectation.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the way we've always done them.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
If they have not worked, we have to look for alternative solutions.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I'm here to talk to you about solutions.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
This has been -- what has been a difficult sign to some of us.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Several years ago, we started thinking about it.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Everyone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Everyone is ready to throw in money,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
in terms of free money aid to developing countries.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Talk about sustainable investment, no one is interested.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You can't raise money.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States --

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[It's] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But start telling them, you know,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
we're going to try to do it in Nigeria -- everyone runs away.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
if you want to help Africa, invest money in sustainable development.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
so you get a glimpse of what we do,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and I'll talk a little bit more about it.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
What we have done is to show that high-quality health care,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
comparable to the best anywhere in the world,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
can be done in a developing country environment.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
We have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
board certified in the USA, Canada or Britain.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Cleveland Clinic -- everywhere in the U.S. --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
that you will need to do those things in the United States.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
(Applause)

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Additionally, we have a policy

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
We take care of everyone.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
(Applause)

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Whether you have one dollar, two dollars -- it doesn't matter.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And I will tell you how we're able to do it.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
We make sure that we select our equipment properly.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
We go for modular units. Units that have multi-modality functions

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
have modular components. Easy to repair, and because of that,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
We emphasize training,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and we make sure that this process is regenerative.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Very soon we will all be dead and gone, but the problems will stay,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
unless we have people taking over from where we stopped.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We made sure that we produced some things ourselves.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
We do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
We get the generators from the companies.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
We manufacture them in-house, ourselves. That keeps the costs down.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So, for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S. --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
when we're finished manufacturing it in-house,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
we come at a price of about two dollars.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
(Applause)

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
between the rich and poor countries

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
is through education and technology.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
All these problems we're talking about --

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
if we bring development, they will all disappear.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Technology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It's been proved: self-care is cost-effective.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
It extends opportunity to the rural centers,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and we can use expertise in a very smart way.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
This is the way our centers are set up.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We currently have three locations in the Caribbean,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and we're planning a fourth one.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And we have now decided to go into Africa.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We will be doing the West African Heart Institute

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. That project will be starting

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
within the next few months. We hope to open in 2008-09.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And we will do other centers.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
This model can be adapted to every disease process.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
All the units, all the centers, are linked

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
through a switched hub to a central server,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and all the images are populated to review stations.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
who is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
just by a click of the button.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I'll lead you through, to see how this happens.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
This is at the Heart Institute. The doctors from anywhere can log in.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I can call you in Switzerland and say, "Listen, go into our system.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Look at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study, tell me what you think."

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
They'll give me that information,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and we'll make the care of the patient better.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
The patient doesn't have to travel.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
He doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
because of limited expertise.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
We also use [an] electronic medical record system.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000
80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them, and yet the technology is there.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But you know, they have that luxury.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Because if you can't get it in Nashville, you can travel to Birmingham,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
two hours away, and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
you can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
so we have to make it happen.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
When we do it, we will put the cost of care down.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And everyone will get the care they deserve.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
It cannot just be technology, we recognize that.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But, you know, you have to tell people what can be done.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and they go home and can't do it.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
They need to be alive, they need to feed.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
We recommend exercise as the most effective, simple, easy thing to do.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
We have had walks every year -- every March, April.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
We form people into groups and make them go into challenges.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Which group loses the most weight, we give them prizes.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Which groups record more walking distance by pedometer,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
we give them prizes. We do this constantly.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
We encourage them to bring children.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
That way we start exposing the children from very early on,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
on what these issues are. Because once they learn it,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
they will stay with it. In doing this we have created

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
at least 100 skilled jobs in Jamaica alone,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and these are physicians with expertise and special training.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
We have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
including four free pacemakers in patients

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
with complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
complete heart block means certain death.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
If you don't get this pacemaker, you will be dead.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So we are pleased with that.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Indirectly, we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And we've hopefully saved a lot of lives.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
By the end of this year, we would have contributed over one million dollars

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in indigent care. In the first four months, it's been 340,000 dollars,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
averaging 85,000 dollars a month. The government will not do that,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
because they have competing needs.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
They need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
People say, "How can you do that?" This is how we can do that.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
At least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
have self-confessed that they did not go to Miami

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more --

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
eight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
getting the same quality of care.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
that do not have the resources to pay.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
(Applause)

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
For this to work, this progress must be sustainable.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So, we emphasize training. Training is critical.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
We have gone further: we have formed a relationship

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
with the University of Technology, Jamaica,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
where I now have an appointment.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And we are starting a biomedical engineering program,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
so that we will train people locally, who can repair that equipment.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
That way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
We're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs --

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
training people in echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
those kinds of things. Now, with that kind of training,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
it gives people motivation.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and all that kind of stuff. In the process, I want you to just hear

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
(Video) Dr. Jason Topping: My name is Jason Topping.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
at the University Hospital of the West Indies.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I came to the Heart Institute in 2006,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I spent three months at the Heart Institute.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
There's been no doubt around my colleagues

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
about the utility of the training I received here,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and I think there's been an increased interest now in --

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Sharon Lazarus: I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
since the past two years. I received training at this institution.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
I think this aspect of training in cardiology

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000
is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Ernest Madu: The lesson in this is that it can be done, and it can be sustained,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and you can make it possible for everyone.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
When have you been appointed to play God?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
It is not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
no matter what fate has assigned to you, will have the opportunity

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
to get the best quality health care in life.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Next stop is West African Heart Institute,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt, Nigeria,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
as I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
We will extend the same system into other areas,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
like dialysis treatment.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and how you can do it. If we do this,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
we can change the face of health care in Africa.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Africa has been good to us; it is time for us to give back to Africa.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I am going. Those who want to come,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I welcome you to come along with me.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Thank you.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
(Applause)
