00:00:00.612 --> 00:00:03.374
For the next 16 minutes,
I'm going to take you on a journey

00:00:03.398 --> 00:00:06.484
that is probably
the biggest dream of humanity:

00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:08.523
to understand the code of life.

00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:11.815
So for me, everything started
many, many years ago

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.562
when I met the first 3D printer.

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:16.260
The concept was fascinating.

00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:18.306
A 3D printer needs three elements:

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.464
a bit of information, some
raw material, some energy,

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:25.822
and it can produce any object
that was not there before.

00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:28.654
I was doing physics,
I was coming back home

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:32.116
and I realized that I actually
always knew a 3D printer.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.476
And everyone does.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.658
It was my mom.

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:35.683
(Laughter)

00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:38.121
My mom takes three elements:

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:42.118
a bit of information, which is between
my father and my mom in this case,

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:46.299
raw elements and energy
in the same media, that is food,

00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:48.831
and after several months, produces me.

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.667
And I was not existent before.

00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:54.453
So apart from the shock of my mom
discovering that she was a 3D printer,

00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:59.215
I immediately got mesmerized
by that piece,

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.956
the first one, the information.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.231
What amount of information does it take

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:05.191
to build and assemble a human?

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:06.789
Is it much? Is it little?

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:08.993
How many thumb drives can you fill?

00:01:09.017 --> 00:01:11.641
Well, I was studying physics
at the beginning

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:17.262
and I took this approximation of a human
as a gigantic Lego piece.

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:21.071
So, imagine that the building
blocks are little atoms

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:25.748
and there is a hydrogen here,
a carbon here, a nitrogen here.

00:01:25.772 --> 00:01:27.343
So in the first approximation,

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:31.710
if I can list the number of atoms
that compose a human being,

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:33.121
I can build it.

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:35.174
Now, you can run some numbers

00:01:35.198 --> 00:01:38.475
and that happens to be
quite an astonishing number.

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:41.256
So the number of atoms,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.035
the file that I will save in my thumb
drive to assemble a little baby,

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:50.726
will actually fill an entire Titanic
of thumb drives --

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.468
multiplied 2,000 times.

00:01:53.957 --> 00:01:57.358
This is the miracle of life.

00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:59.994
Every time you see from now on
a pregnant lady,

00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:02.874
she's assembling the biggest
amount of information

00:02:02.898 --> 00:02:04.454
that you will ever encounter.

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:07.428
Forget big data, forget
anything you heard of.

00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:10.333
This is the biggest amount
of information that exists.

00:02:10.357 --> 00:02:14.190
(Applause)

00:02:14.214 --> 00:02:18.858
But nature, fortunately, is much smarter
than a young physicist,

00:02:18.882 --> 00:02:22.458
and in four billion years, managed
to pack this information

00:02:22.482 --> 00:02:25.187
in a small crystal we call DNA.

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:29.917
We met it for the first time in 1950
when Rosalind Franklin,

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.497
an amazing scientist, a woman,

00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:32.910
took a picture of it.

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:38.122
But it took us more than 40 years
to finally poke inside a human cell,

00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:39.748
take out this crystal,

00:02:39.772 --> 00:02:42.852
unroll it, and read it for the first time.

00:02:43.615 --> 00:02:46.856
The code comes out to be
a fairly simple alphabet,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.652
four letters: A, T, C and G.

00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:54.166
And to build a human,
you need three billion of them.

00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:56.112
Three billion.

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:57.715
How many are three billion?

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.501
It doesn't really make
any sense as a number, right?

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:04.610
So I was thinking how
I could explain myself better

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:07.684
about how big and enormous this code is.

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:10.762
But there is -- I mean,
I'm going to have some help,

00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:14.013
and the best person to help me
introduce the code

00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:17.559
is actually the first man
to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:20.973
So welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.

00:03:20.997 --> 00:03:27.928
(Applause)

00:03:27.952 --> 00:03:30.208
Not the man in the flesh,

00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:33.793
but for the first time in history,

00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:37.279
this is the genome of a specific human,

00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:41.063
printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter:

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:45.083
262,000 pages of information,

00:03:45.107 --> 00:03:49.471
450 kilograms, shipped
from the United States to Canada

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:54.338
thanks to Bruno Bowden,
Lulu.com, a start-up, did everything.

00:03:54.362 --> 00:03:55.825
It was an amazing feat.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.146
But this is the visual perception
of what is the code of life.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.648
And now, for the first time,
I can do something fun.

00:04:02.672 --> 00:04:05.219
I can actually poke inside it and read.

00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:09.868
So let me take an interesting
book ... like this one.

00:04:13.077 --> 00:04:15.611
I have an annotation;
it's a fairly big book.

00:04:15.635 --> 00:04:19.362
So just to let you see
what is the code of life.

00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:23.957
Thousands and thousands and thousands

00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:26.651
and millions of letters.

00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:29.071
And they apparently make sense.

00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:30.852
Let's get to a specific part.

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:32.933
Let me read it to you:

00:04:32.957 --> 00:04:33.978
(Laughter)

00:04:34.002 --> 00:04:38.008
"AAG, AAT, ATA."

00:04:38.965 --> 00:04:41.032
To you it sounds like mute letters,

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:45.097
but this sequence gives
the color of the eyes to Craig.

00:04:45.633 --> 00:04:47.565
I'll show you another part of the book.

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:49.683
This is actually a little
more complicated.

00:04:50.983 --> 00:04:53.630
Chromosome 14, book 132:

00:04:53.654 --> 00:04:55.744
(Laughter)

00:04:55.768 --> 00:04:57.045
As you might expect.

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.535
(Laughter)

00:05:02.857 --> 00:05:07.364
"ATT, CTT, GATT."

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:10.016
This human is lucky,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.557
because if you miss just
two letters in this position --

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.458
two letters of our three billion --

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:18.501
he will be condemned
to a terrible disease:

00:05:18.525 --> 00:05:19.965
cystic fibrosis.

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:23.402
We have no cure for it,
we don't know how to solve it,

00:05:23.426 --> 00:05:27.181
and it's just two letters
of difference from what we are.

00:05:27.585 --> 00:05:30.290
A wonderful book, a mighty book,

00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:33.113
a mighty book that helped me understand

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:35.890
and show you something quite remarkable.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.915
Every one of you -- what makes
me, me and you, you --

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.893
is just about five million of these,

00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:45.145
half a book.

00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:47.678
For the rest,

00:05:47.702 --> 00:05:50.264
we are all absolutely identical.

00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:55.026
Five hundred pages
is the miracle of life that you are.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.581
The rest, we all share it.

00:05:57.605 --> 00:06:00.514
So think about that again
when we think that we are different.

00:06:00.538 --> 00:06:02.759
This is the amount that we share.

00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.870
So now that I have your attention,

00:06:06.894 --> 00:06:08.253
the next question is:

00:06:08.277 --> 00:06:09.428
How do I read it?

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:10.961
How do I make sense out of it?

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.649
Well, for however good you can be
at assembling Swedish furniture,

00:06:15.673 --> 00:06:19.236
this instruction manual
is nothing you can crack in your life.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.863
(Laughter)

00:06:20.887 --> 00:06:23.999
And so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters,

00:06:24.023 --> 00:06:26.563
Peter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself,

00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:28.514
decided to assemble a new company.

00:06:28.538 --> 00:06:29.950
Human Longevity was born,

00:06:29.974 --> 00:06:31.344
with one mission:

00:06:31.368 --> 00:06:33.229
trying everything we can try

00:06:33.253 --> 00:06:36.012
and learning everything
we can learn from these books,

00:06:36.036 --> 00:06:37.741
with one target --

00:06:38.862 --> 00:06:41.663
making real the dream
of personalized medicine,

00:06:41.687 --> 00:06:45.454
understanding what things
should be done to have better health

00:06:45.478 --> 00:06:47.761
and what are the secrets in these books.

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:52.579
An amazing team, 40 data scientists
and many, many more people,

00:06:52.603 --> 00:06:53.953
a pleasure to work with.

00:06:53.977 --> 00:06:56.230
The concept is actually very simple.

00:06:56.254 --> 00:06:59.412
We're going to use a technology
called machine learning.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:03.975
On one side, we have genomes --
thousands of them.

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:07.996
On the other side, we collected
the biggest database of human beings:

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.316
phenotypes, 3D scan, NMR --
everything you can think of.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.239
Inside there, on these two opposite sides,

00:07:15.263 --> 00:07:17.705
there is the secret of translation.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.201
And in the middle, we build a machine.

00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:23.186
We build a machine
and we train a machine --

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.420
well, not exactly one machine,
many, many machines --

00:07:26.444 --> 00:07:30.988
to try to understand and translate
the genome in a phenotype.

00:07:31.362 --> 00:07:34.702
What are those letters,
and what do they do?

00:07:34.726 --> 00:07:37.473
It's an approach that can
be used for everything,

00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:40.490
but using it in genomics
is particularly complicated.

00:07:40.514 --> 00:07:43.790
Little by little we grew and we wanted
to build different challenges.

00:07:43.814 --> 00:07:46.546
We started from the beginning,
from common traits.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.173
Common traits are comfortable
because they are common,

00:07:49.197 --> 00:07:50.381
everyone has them.

00:07:50.405 --> 00:07:52.899
So we started to ask our questions:

00:07:52.923 --> 00:07:54.303
Can we predict height?

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:57.162
Can we read the books
and predict your height?

00:07:57.186 --> 00:07:58.337
Well, we actually can,

00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:00.154
with five centimeters of precision.

00:08:00.178 --> 00:08:03.313
BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle,

00:08:03.337 --> 00:08:07.201
but we still can, we get in the ballpark,
eight kilograms of precision.

00:08:07.225 --> 00:08:08.456
Can we predict eye color?

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.638
Yeah, we can.

00:08:09.662 --> 00:08:10.986
Eighty percent accuracy.

00:08:11.466 --> 00:08:13.324
Can we predict skin color?

00:08:13.348 --> 00:08:15.789
Yeah we can, 80 percent accuracy.

00:08:15.813 --> 00:08:17.153
Can we predict age?

00:08:18.121 --> 00:08:21.860
We can, because apparently,
the code changes during your life.

00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:25.166
It gets shorter, you lose pieces,
it gets insertions.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.745
We read the signals, and we make a model.

00:08:28.438 --> 00:08:29.913
Now, an interesting challenge:

00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:31.666
Can we predict a human face?

00:08:33.014 --> 00:08:34.292
It's a little complicated,

00:08:34.316 --> 00:08:37.507
because a human face is scattered
among millions of these letters.

00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:40.160
And a human face is not
a very well-defined object.

00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:42.235
So, we had to build an entire tier of it

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:44.969
to learn and teach
a machine what a face is,

00:08:44.993 --> 00:08:47.030
and embed and compress it.

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:49.302
And if you're comfortable
with machine learning,

00:08:49.326 --> 00:08:51.610
you understand what the challenge is here.

00:08:52.108 --> 00:08:58.099
Now, after 15 years -- 15 years after
we read the first sequence --

00:08:58.123 --> 00:09:01.025
this October, we started
to see some signals.

00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:03.504
And it was a very emotional moment.

00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:07.273
What you see here is a subject
coming in our lab.

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:09.547
This is a face for us.

00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:13.202
So we take the real face of a subject,
we reduce the complexity,

00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:15.196
because not everything is in your face --

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.006
lots of features and defects
and asymmetries come from your life.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.499
We symmetrize the face,
and we run our algorithm.

00:09:23.245 --> 00:09:25.143
The results that I show you right now,

00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:28.539
this is the prediction we have
from the blood.

00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:31.120
(Applause)

00:09:31.144 --> 00:09:32.579
Wait a second.

00:09:32.603 --> 00:09:37.295
In these seconds, your eyes are watching,
left and right, left and right,

00:09:37.319 --> 00:09:41.249
and your brain wants
those pictures to be identical.

00:09:41.273 --> 00:09:43.719
So I ask you to do
another exercise, to be honest.

00:09:43.743 --> 00:09:46.030
Please search for the differences,

00:09:46.054 --> 00:09:47.415
which are many.

00:09:47.439 --> 00:09:50.042
The biggest amount of signal
comes from gender,

00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:55.267
then there is age, BMI,
the ethnicity component of a human.

00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:59.002
And scaling up over that signal
is much more complicated.

00:09:59.026 --> 00:10:02.276
But what you see here,
even in the differences,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.895
lets you understand
that we are in the right ballpark,

00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:07.267
that we are getting closer.

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.640
And it's already giving you some emotions.

00:10:09.664 --> 00:10:12.367
This is another subject
that comes in place,

00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:13.800
and this is a prediction.

00:10:13.824 --> 00:10:18.420
A little smaller face, we didn't get
the complete cranial structure,

00:10:18.444 --> 00:10:21.095
but still, it's in the ballpark.

00:10:21.634 --> 00:10:23.858
This is a subject that comes in our lab,

00:10:23.882 --> 00:10:25.325
and this is the prediction.

00:10:26.056 --> 00:10:30.732
So these people have never been seen
in the training of the machine.

00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:33.593
These are the so-called "held-out" set.

00:10:33.617 --> 00:10:37.357
But these are people that you will
probably never believe.

00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:40.057
We're publishing everything
in a scientific publication,

00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:41.232
you can read it.

00:10:41.256 --> 00:10:43.600
But since we are onstage,
Chris challenged me.

00:10:43.624 --> 00:10:47.250
I probably exposed myself
and tried to predict

00:10:47.274 --> 00:10:50.105
someone that you might recognize.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.895
So, in this vial of blood --
and believe me, you have no idea

00:10:54.919 --> 00:10:57.799
what we had to do to have
this blood now, here --

00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:01.724
in this vial of blood is the amount
of biological information

00:11:01.748 --> 00:11:04.025
that we need to do a full genome sequence.

00:11:04.049 --> 00:11:06.119
We just need this amount.

00:11:06.528 --> 00:11:09.733
We ran this sequence,
and I'm going to do it with you.

00:11:09.757 --> 00:11:13.736
And we start to layer up
all the understanding we have.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.110
In the vial of blood,
we predicted he's a male.

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:18.498
And the subject is a male.

00:11:18.996 --> 00:11:21.434
We predict that he's a meter and 76 cm.

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:23.850
The subject is a meter and 77 cm.

00:11:23.874 --> 00:11:27.984
So, we predicted that he's 76;
the subject is 82.

00:11:28.701 --> 00:11:31.333
We predict his age, 38.

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.261
The subject is 35.

00:11:33.851 --> 00:11:35.975
We predict his eye color.

00:11:36.824 --> 00:11:38.035
Too dark.

00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:39.614
We predict his skin color.

00:11:40.026 --> 00:11:41.436
We are almost there.

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:43.272
That's his face.

00:11:45.172 --> 00:11:48.441
Now, the reveal moment:

00:11:48.465 --> 00:11:50.235
the subject is this person.

00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:52.194
(Laughter)

00:11:52.218 --> 00:11:54.276
And I did it intentionally.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.992
I am a very particular
and peculiar ethnicity.

00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:00.966
Southern European, Italians --
they never fit in models.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:06.120
And it's particular -- that ethnicity
is a complex corner case for our model.

00:12:06.144 --> 00:12:07.653
But there is another point.

00:12:07.677 --> 00:12:11.154
So, one of the things that we use
a lot to recognize people

00:12:11.178 --> 00:12:12.900
will never be written in the genome.

00:12:12.924 --> 00:12:15.241
It's our free will, it's how I look.

00:12:15.265 --> 00:12:18.494
Not my haircut in this case,
but my beard cut.

00:12:18.518 --> 00:12:22.071
So I'm going to show you, I'm going to,
in this case, transfer it --

00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:24.860
and this is nothing more
than Photoshop, no modeling --

00:12:24.884 --> 00:12:26.597
the beard on the subject.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:30.093
And immediately, we get
much, much better in the feeling.

00:12:30.955 --> 00:12:33.664
So, why do we do this?

00:12:35.938 --> 00:12:41.078
We certainly don't do it
for predicting height

00:12:41.102 --> 00:12:43.474
or taking a beautiful picture
out of your blood.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.408
We do it because the same technology
and the same approach,

00:12:48.432 --> 00:12:50.952
the machine learning of this code,

00:12:50.976 --> 00:12:54.113
is helping us to understand how we work,

00:12:54.137 --> 00:12:55.623
how your body works,

00:12:55.647 --> 00:12:57.312
how your body ages,

00:12:57.336 --> 00:13:00.105
how disease generates in your body,

00:13:00.129 --> 00:13:03.101
how your cancer grows and develops,

00:13:03.125 --> 00:13:04.908
how drugs work

00:13:04.932 --> 00:13:07.246
and if they work on your body.

00:13:07.713 --> 00:13:09.380
This is a huge challenge.

00:13:09.894 --> 00:13:11.532
This is a challenge that we share

00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:14.135
with thousands of other
researchers around the world.

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:16.381
It's called personalized medicine.

00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:20.585
It's the ability to move
from a statistical approach

00:13:20.609 --> 00:13:22.641
where you're a dot in the ocean,

00:13:22.665 --> 00:13:24.478
to a personalized approach,

00:13:24.502 --> 00:13:26.687
where we read all these books

00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:29.575
and we get an understanding
of exactly how you are.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.622
But it is a particularly
complicated challenge,

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:37.644
because of all these books, as of today,

00:13:37.668 --> 00:13:40.310
we just know probably two percent:

00:13:41.027 --> 00:13:44.680
four books of more than 175.

00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:49.227
And this is not the topic of my talk,

00:13:50.145 --> 00:13:52.743
because we will learn more.

00:13:53.378 --> 00:13:56.047
There are the best minds
in the world on this topic.

00:13:57.048 --> 00:13:58.882
The prediction will get better,

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:01.159
the model will get more precise.

00:14:01.183 --> 00:14:03.041
And the more we learn,

00:14:03.065 --> 00:14:07.895
the more we will
be confronted with decisions

00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:10.940
that we never had to face before

00:14:10.964 --> 00:14:12.399
about life,

00:14:12.423 --> 00:14:14.097
about death,

00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:15.724
about parenting.

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:25.372
So, we are touching the very
inner detail on how life works.

00:14:26.118 --> 00:14:29.276
And it's a revolution
that cannot be confined

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.959
in the domain of science or technology.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.204
This must be a global conversation.

00:14:35.798 --> 00:14:41.015
We must start to think of the future
we're building as a humanity.

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:45.103
We need to interact with creatives,
with artists, with philosophers,

00:14:45.127 --> 00:14:46.637
with politicians.

00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:47.819
Everyone is involved,

00:14:47.843 --> 00:14:50.668
because it's the future of our species.

00:14:51.273 --> 00:14:55.241
Without fear, but with the understanding

00:14:55.265 --> 00:14:59.136
that the decisions
that we make in the next year

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.949
will change the course of history forever.

00:15:03.732 --> 00:15:04.892
Thank you.

00:15:04.916 --> 00:15:15.075
(Applause)
