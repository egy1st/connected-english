00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.040
I am holding something remarkably old.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.416
It is older than any human artifact,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.736
older than life on Earth,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.840
older than the continents
and the oceans between them.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.616
This was formed
over four billion years ago

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.776
in the earliest days of the solar system

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.600
while the planets were still forming.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.496
This rusty lump of nickel and iron
may not appear special,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.960
but when it is cut open ...

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.000
you can see that it is different
from earthly metals.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.336
This pattern reveals metallic crystals
that can only form out in space

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.936
where molten metal
can cool extremely slowly,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.280
a few degrees every million years.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.256
This was once part
of a much larger object,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.856
one of millions left over
after the planets formed.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.880
We call these objects asteroids.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.936
Asteroids are our oldest
and most numerous cosmic neighbors.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.016
This graphic shows near-Earth asteroids
orbiting around the Sun,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.296
shown in yellow,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.256
and swinging close to the Earth's orbit,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.496
shown in blue.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.856
The sizes of the Earth, Sun and asteroids
have been greatly exaggerated

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.256
so you can see them clearly.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.656
Teams of scientists across the globe
are searching for these objects,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.616
discovering new ones every day,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.760
steadily mapping near-Earth space.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.240
Much of this work is funded by NASA.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.536
I think of the search for these asteroids
as a giant public works project,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.816
but instead of building a highway,
we're charting outer space,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.816
building an archive
that will last for generations.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.760
These are the 1,556 near-Earth asteroids
discovered just last year.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.336
And these are all of the known
near-Earth asteroids,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.376
which at last count was 13,733.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.536
Each one has been imaged, cataloged

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.936
and had its path
around the Sun determined.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.056
Although it varies
from asteroid to asteroid,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.336
the paths of most asteroids
can be predicted for dozens of years.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.136
And the paths of some asteroids can be
predicted with incredible precision.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.816
For example, scientists
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.856
predicted where the asteroid Toutatis
was going to be four years in advance

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.976
to within 30 kilometers.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.296
In those four years,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.136
Toutatis traveled 8.5 billion kilometers.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.735
That's a fractional precision

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:19.560
of 0.000000004.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.840
(Laughter)

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.136
Now, the reason I have
this beautiful asteroid fragment

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.696
is because, like all neighbors,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.920
asteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.120
(Laughter)

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.136
Three years ago today,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.816
a small asteroid exploded
over the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.136
That object was about 19 meters across,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.080
or about as big as a convenience store.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.920
Objects of this size hit the Earth
every 50 years or so.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.576
66 million years ago,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.536
a much larger object hit the Earth,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.336
causing a massive extinction.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.576
75 percent of plant
and animal species were lost,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.800
including, sadly, the dinosaurs.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.016
That object was
about 10 kilometers across,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.216
and 10 kilometers is roughly
the cruising altitude of a 747 jet.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.136
So the next time you're in an airplane,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.976
snag a window seat, look out
and imagine a rock so enormous

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.096
that resting on the ground,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.000
it just grazes your wingtip.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.157
It's so wide that it takes your plane
one full minute to fly past it.

00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:23.678
That's the size of the asteroid
that hit the Earth.

00:03:24.518 --> 00:03:26.294
It has only been within my lifetime

00:03:26.318 --> 00:03:29.534
that asteroids have been considered
a credible threat to our planet.

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:32.134
And since then, there's been
a focused effort underway

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:33.998
to discover and catalog these objects.

00:03:35.238 --> 00:03:37.334
I am lucky enough
to be part of this effort.

00:03:37.358 --> 00:03:41.014
I'm part of a team of scientists
that use NASA's NEOWISE telescope.

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:43.734
Now, NEOWISE was not
designed to find asteroids.

00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:47.974
It was designed to orbit the earth
and look far beyond our solar system

00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:51.414
to seek out the coldest stars
and the most luminous galaxies.

00:03:51.438 --> 00:03:54.878
And it did that very well
for its designed lifetime of seven months.

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:58.774
But today, six years later,
it's still going.

00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:01.534
We've repurposed it
to discover and study asteroids.

00:04:01.558 --> 00:04:03.894
And although it's
a wonderful little space robot,

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:05.998
these days it's kind of like a used car.

00:04:06.518 --> 00:04:09.774
The cryogen that used to refrigerate
its sensors is long gone,

00:04:09.798 --> 00:04:11.998
so we joke that
its air-conditioning is broken.

00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:16.894
It's got 920 million miles
on the odometer,

00:04:16.918 --> 00:04:18.174
but it still runs great

00:04:18.198 --> 00:04:21.774
and reliably takes a photograph
of the sky every 11 seconds.

00:04:21.798 --> 00:04:24.638
It's taken 23 photos
since I began speaking to you.

00:04:26.118 --> 00:04:28.294
One of the reasons NEOWISE is so valuable

00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:30.934
is that it sees the sky
in the thermal infrared.

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.294
That means that instead of seeing
the sunlight that asteroids reflect,

00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:36.134
NEOWISE sees the heat that they emit.

00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:39.894
This is a vital capability
since some asteroids are as dark as coal

00:04:39.918 --> 00:04:43.374
and can be difficult or impossible
to spot with other telescopes.

00:04:43.398 --> 00:04:46.478
But all asteroids, light or dark,
shine brightly for NEOWISE.

00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.734
Astronomers are using
every technique at their disposal

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:54.054
to discover and study asteroids.

00:04:54.078 --> 00:04:56.934
In 2010, a historic milestone was reached.

00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:01.014
The community, together, discovered
over 90 percent of asteroids

00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:02.894
bigger than one kilometer across --

00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:05.894
objects capable
of massive destruction to Earth.

00:05:05.918 --> 00:05:07.494
But the job's not done yet.

00:05:07.518 --> 00:05:12.454
An object 140 meters or bigger
could decimate a medium-sized country.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.678
So far, we've only found
25 percent of those.

00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:19.654
We must keep searching the sky
for near-Earth asteroids.

00:05:19.678 --> 00:05:22.414
We are the only species
able to understand calculus

00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:24.094
or build telescopes.

00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:26.094
We know how to find these objects.

00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:28.254
This is our responsibility.

00:05:28.278 --> 00:05:32.054
If we found a hazardous asteroid
with significant early warning,

00:05:32.078 --> 00:05:33.774
we could nudge it out of the way.

00:05:33.798 --> 00:05:36.854
Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes
or volcanic eruptions,

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:39.774
an asteroid impact
can be precisely predicted

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.254
and prevented.

00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:44.414
What we need to do now
is map near-Earth space.

00:05:44.438 --> 00:05:46.294
We must keep searching the sky.

00:05:46.318 --> 00:05:47.534
Thank you.

00:05:47.558 --> 00:05:53.129
(Applause)
