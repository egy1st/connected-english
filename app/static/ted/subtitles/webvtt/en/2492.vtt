00:00:01.798 --> 00:00:04.271
I was three months pregnant with twins

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:07.639
when my husband Ross and I
went to my second sonogram.

00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:11.539
I was 35 years old at the time,

00:00:11.563 --> 00:00:14.883
and I knew that that meant
we had a higher risk

00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:16.851
of having a child with a birth defect.

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:20.965
So, Ross and I researched
the standard birth defects,

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.989
and we felt reasonably prepared.

00:00:23.973 --> 00:00:25.918
Well, nothing would have prepared us

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:28.996
for the bizarre diagnosis
that we were about to face.

00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:33.830
The doctor explained
that one of our twins, Thomas,

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:36.678
had a fatal birth defect
called anencephaly.

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:40.870
This means that his brain
was not formed correctly

00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:42.870
because part of his skull was missing.

00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:47.187
Babies with this diagnosis
typically die in utero

00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:50.782
or within a few minutes, hours
or days of being born.

00:00:53.013 --> 00:00:56.228
But the other twin, Callum,

00:00:56.252 --> 00:01:00.140
appeared to be healthy,
as far as the doctor could tell,

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:04.331
and these twins were identical,

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:05.624
genetically identical.

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:12.737
So after a lot of questions about
how this could have possibly happened,

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.897
a selective reduction was mentioned,

00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:18.822
and while this procedure
was not impossible,

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:23.204
it posed some unique risks
for the healthy twin and for me,

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:25.585
so we decided to carry
the pregnancy to term.

00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:31.292
So there I was, three months pregnant,
with two trimesters ahead of me,

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:36.195
and I had to find a way to manage
my blood pressure and my stress.

00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:42.204
And it felt like having a roommate
point a loaded gun at you for six months.

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:48.483
But I stared down
the barrel of that gun for so long

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:50.570
that I saw a light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:54.610
While there was nothing we could do
to prevent the tragedy,

00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:57.097
I wanted to find a way
for Thomas's brief life

00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.342
to have some kind of positive impact.

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:03.032
So I asked my nurse about organ,
eye and tissue donation.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.601
She connected with our local
organ-procurement organization,

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:09.918
the Washington Regional
Transplant Community.

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.930
WRTC explained to me

00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:18.355
that Thomas would probably be too small
at birth to donate for transplant,

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.529
and I was shocked:

00:02:19.553 --> 00:02:21.957
I didn't even know
you could be rejected for that.

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:25.393
But they said that he would be
a good candidate to donate for research.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.321
This helped me see Thomas in a new light.

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:31.240
As opposed to just a victim of a disease,

00:02:31.264 --> 00:02:34.851
I started to see him as a possible key
to unlock a medical mystery.

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:39.566
On March 23, 2010,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.097
the twins were born,
and they were both born alive.

00:02:43.978 --> 00:02:45.644
And just like the doctor said,

00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:48.747
Thomas was missing
the top part of his skull,

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:50.294
but he could nurse,

00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:51.770
drink from a bottle,

00:02:51.794 --> 00:02:55.093
cuddle and grab our fingers
like a normal baby,

00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:56.714
and he slept in our arms.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:01.442
After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms

00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:02.862
surrounded by our family.

00:03:04.846 --> 00:03:08.981
We called WRTC, who sent a van to our home

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:11.544
and brought him to Children's
National Medical Center.

00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:16.572
A few hours later, we got a call to say
that the recovery was a success,

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.830
and Thomas's donations
would be going to four different places.

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.555
His cord blood would go
to Duke University.

00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:27.223
His liver would go to a cell-therapy
company called Cytonet in Durham.

00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:31.508
His corneas would go
to Schepens Eye Research Institute,

00:03:31.532 --> 00:03:33.691
which is part of Harvard Medical School,

00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:36.571
and his retinas would go
to the University of Pennsylvania.

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:42.011
A few days later, we had a funeral
with our immediate family,

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:43.979
including baby Callum,

00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:47.317
and we basically
closed this chapter in our lives.

00:03:47.718 --> 00:03:50.634
But I did find myself wondering,
what's happening now?

00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:52.722
What are the researchers learning?

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.423
And was it even worthwhile to donate?

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.741
WRTC invited Ross and I
to a grief retreat,

00:04:00.765 --> 00:04:03.518
and we met about
15 other grieving families

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:06.169
who had donated their loved one's
organs for transplant.

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:09.895
Some of them had even received letters

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.888
from the people who received
their loved one's organs,

00:04:12.912 --> 00:04:14.077
saying thank you.

00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:17.227
I learned that they
could even meet each other

00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:18.689
if they'd both sign a waiver,

00:04:18.713 --> 00:04:20.109
almost like an open adoption.

00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:23.746
And I was so excited,
I thought maybe I could write a letter

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.379
or I could get a letter
and learn about what happened.

00:04:26.403 --> 00:04:27.942
But I was disappointed to learn

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:31.136
that this process only exists
for people who donate for transplant.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.422
So I was jealous.
I had transplant envy, I guess.

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:35.596
(Laughter)

00:04:36.104 --> 00:04:38.000
But over the years that followed,

00:04:38.024 --> 00:04:40.500
I learned a lot more about donation,

00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:42.602
and I even got a job in the field.

00:04:42.626 --> 00:04:44.039
And I came up with an idea.

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.538
I wrote a letter that started out,

00:04:47.562 --> 00:04:48.728
"Dear Researcher."

00:04:50.468 --> 00:04:52.318
I explained who I was,

00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:56.210
and I asked if they could tell me
why they requested infant retinas

00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:58.469
in March of 2010,

00:04:58.493 --> 00:05:00.762
and I asked if my family
could visit their lab.

00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:05.049
I emailed it to the eye bank
that arranged the donation,

00:05:05.073 --> 00:05:07.451
the Old Dominion Eye Foundation,

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:09.967
and asked if they could
send it to the right person.

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:12.626
They said that they had
never done this before,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.539
and they couldn't guarantee a response,

00:05:14.563 --> 00:05:17.379
but they wouldn't be an obstacle,
and they would deliver it.

00:05:18.506 --> 00:05:20.697
Two days later, I got a response

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:23.705
from Dr. Arupa Ganguly
of the University of Pennsylvania.

00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:26.239
She thanked me for the donation,

00:05:26.263 --> 00:05:28.986
and she explained
that she is studying retinoblastoma,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.827
which is a deadly cancer of the retina

00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:32.977
that affects children
under the age of five,

00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:35.691
and she said that yes,
we were invited to visit her lab.

00:05:36.612 --> 00:05:38.254
So next we talked on the phone,

00:05:38.278 --> 00:05:40.325
and one of the first things she said to me

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.180
was that she couldn't possibly
imagine how we felt,

00:05:43.204 --> 00:05:45.944
and that Thomas had given
the ultimate sacrifice,

00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:48.055
and that she seemed
to feel indebted to us.

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:51.835
So I said, "Nothing against your study,

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:53.525
but we didn't actually pick it.

00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:56.707
We donated to the system,
and the system chose your study.

00:05:57.493 --> 00:06:02.383
I said, "And second of all,
bad things happen to children every day,

00:06:02.407 --> 00:06:04.195
and if you didn't want these retinas,

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.749
they would probably
be buried in the ground right now.

00:06:06.773 --> 00:06:10.139
So to be able to participate in your study

00:06:10.163 --> 00:06:13.806
gives Thomas's life
a new layer of meaning.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.774
So, never feel guilty
about using this tissue."

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:20.379
Next, she explained to me how rare it was.

00:06:20.403 --> 00:06:24.099
She had placed a request
for this tissue six years earlier

00:06:24.123 --> 00:06:26.336
with the National Disease
Research Interchange.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.494
She got only one sample of tissue
that fit her criteria,

00:06:30.518 --> 00:06:31.723
and it was Thomas's.

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.688
Next, we arranged a date for me
to come visit the lab,

00:06:36.712 --> 00:06:41.362
and we chose March 23, 2015,
which was the twins' fifth birthday.

00:06:42.563 --> 00:06:46.499
After we hung up, I emailed her
some pictures of Thomas and Callum,

00:06:46.523 --> 00:06:49.412
and a few weeks later,
we received this T-shirt in the mail.

00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:53.941
A few months later, Ross, Callum
and I piled in the car

00:06:53.965 --> 00:06:55.556
and we went for a road trip.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.144
We met Arupa and her staff,

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:02.416
and Arupa said that when I told her
not to feel guilty, that it was a relief,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.741
and that she hadn't seen it
from our perspective.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.328
She also explained that Thomas
had a secret code name.

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:14.300
The same way Henrietta Lacks
is called HeLa,

00:07:14.324 --> 00:07:16.950
Thomas was called RES 360.

00:07:17.394 --> 00:07:18.792
RES means research,

00:07:18.816 --> 00:07:22.316
and 360 means he was the 360th specimen

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.125
over the course of about 10 years.

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:29.276
She also shared with us a unique document,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.785
and it was the shipping label

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:35.293
that sent his retinas
from DC to Philadelphia.

00:07:36.273 --> 00:07:39.662
This shipping label
is like an heirloom to us now.

00:07:40.304 --> 00:07:43.812
It's the same way that a military medal
or a wedding certificate might be.

00:07:44.687 --> 00:07:50.087
Arupa also explained that she is using
Thomas's retina and his RNA

00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:53.521
to try to inactivate the gene
that causes tumor formation,

00:07:53.545 --> 00:07:56.655
and she even showed us some results
that were based on RES 360.

00:07:57.959 --> 00:07:59.793
Then she took us to the freezer

00:07:59.817 --> 00:08:03.252
and she showed us the two samples
that she still has

00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:05.598
that are still labeled RES 360.

00:08:05.622 --> 00:08:07.482
There's two little ones left.

00:08:07.506 --> 00:08:09.034
She said she saved it

00:08:09.058 --> 00:08:11.386
because she doesn't know
when she might get more.

00:08:12.553 --> 00:08:14.601
After this, we went to the conference room

00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:17.235
and we relaxed and we had lunch together,

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:21.529
and the lab staff presented Callum
with a birthday gift.

00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:23.822
It was a child's lab kit.

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:26.807
And they also offered him an internship.

00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:30.014
(Laughter)

00:08:30.038 --> 00:08:33.188
So in closing, I have two
simple messages today.

00:08:33.578 --> 00:08:37.382
One is that most of us probably
don't think about donating to research.

00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:40.516
I know I didn't.
I think I'm a normal person.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.691
But I did it.

00:08:41.715 --> 00:08:43.857
It was a good experience,
and I recommend it,

00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:45.825
and it brought my family a lot of peace.

00:08:45.849 --> 00:08:48.634
And second is if you work
with human tissue

00:08:48.658 --> 00:08:51.253
and you wonder about the donor
and about the family,

00:08:51.277 --> 00:08:52.472
write them a letter.

00:08:52.496 --> 00:08:55.312
Tell them you received it,
tell them what you're working on,

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:57.003
and invite them to visit your lab,

00:08:57.027 --> 00:08:59.552
because that visit may be
even more gratifying for you

00:08:59.576 --> 00:09:00.807
than it is for them.

00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:02.593
And I'd also like to ask you a favor.

00:09:02.617 --> 00:09:05.576
If you're ever successful
in arranging one of these visits,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.918
please tell me about it.

00:09:08.064 --> 00:09:09.760
The other part of my family's story

00:09:09.784 --> 00:09:12.096
is that we ended up visiting
all four facilities

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.182
that received Thomas's donations.

00:09:14.206 --> 00:09:17.130
And we met amazing people
doing inspiring work.

00:09:18.003 --> 00:09:23.104
The way I see it now
is that Thomas got into Harvard,

00:09:23.128 --> 00:09:25.294
Duke and Penn --

00:09:25.318 --> 00:09:28.643
(Laughter)

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:31.035
And he has a job at Cytonet,

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:33.844
and he has colleagues and he has coworkers

00:09:33.868 --> 00:09:35.629
who are in the top of their fields.

00:09:35.653 --> 00:09:38.224
And they need him
in order to do their job.

00:09:39.137 --> 00:09:43.788
And a life that once seemed
brief and insignificant

00:09:43.812 --> 00:09:49.494
revealed itself to be vital,
everlasting and relevant.

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:52.771
And I only hope that my life
can be as relevant.

00:09:53.512 --> 00:09:54.663
Thank you.

00:09:54.687 --> 00:10:04.415
(Applause)
