00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:03.897
Design is a slippery
and elusive phenomenon,

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:07.182
which has meant different
things at different times.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:11.474
But all truly inspiring design projects
have one thing in common:

00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:13.324
they began with a dream.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.117
And the bolder the dream,

00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:18.782
the greater the design feat
that will be required to achieve it.

00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:22.700
And this is why the greatest
designers are almost always

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:26.412
the biggest dreamers
and rebels and renegades.

00:00:26.787 --> 00:00:29.570
This has been the case throughout history,

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:33.515
all the way back to the year 300 BC,

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.658
when a 13-year-old became the king

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:41.125
of a remote, very poor
and very small Asian country.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:44.960
He dreamt of acquiring land,
riches and power

00:00:44.984 --> 00:00:46.651
through military conquest.

00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:48.058
And his design skills --

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:49.905
improbable though it sounds --

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.974
would be essential
in enabling him to do so.

00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:54.755
At the time,

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:58.189
all weapons were made by hand
to different specifications.

00:00:58.213 --> 00:01:01.519
So if an archer ran out
of arrows during a battle,

00:01:01.543 --> 00:01:05.466
they wouldn't necessarily be able
to fire another archer's arrows

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.338
from their bow.

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:10.923
This of course meant that they would
be less effective in combat

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:12.851
and very vulnerable, too.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.941
Ying solved this problem

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:19.056
by insisting that all bows and arrows
were designed identically,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.811
so they were interchangeable.

00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:24.837
And he did the same for daggers,
axes, spears, shields

00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:27.346
and every other form of weaponry.

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:31.908
His formidably equipped army
won batter after battle,

00:01:31.932 --> 00:01:33.722
and within 15 years,

00:01:33.746 --> 00:01:36.904
his tiny kingdom had
succeeded in conquering

00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:39.753
all its larger, richer,
more powerful neighbors,

00:01:39.777 --> 00:01:42.300
to found the mighty Chinese Empire.

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:44.570
Now, no one, of course,

00:01:44.594 --> 00:01:48.372
would have thought of describing
Ying Zheng as a designer at the time --

00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:49.604
why would they?

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:53.431
And yet he used design
unknowingly and instinctively

00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:55.415
but with tremendous ingenuity

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.607
to achieve his ends.

00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:02.171
And so did another equally
improbable, accidental designer,

00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:05.950
who was also not above using
violence to get what he wanted.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:11.636
This was Edward Teach, better known
as the British pirate, Blackbeard.

00:02:12.012 --> 00:02:14.277
This was the golden age of piracy,

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.974
where pirates like Teach
were terrorizing the high seas.

00:02:17.998 --> 00:02:19.967
Colonial trade was flourishing,

00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:22.252
and piracy was highly profitable.

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:27.115
And the smarter pirates like him
realized that to maximize their spoils,

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.766
they needed to attack
their enemies so brutally

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.583
that they would surrender on sight.

00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:34.758
So in other words,

00:02:34.782 --> 00:02:37.328
they could take the ships
without wasting ammunition,

00:02:37.352 --> 00:02:39.393
or incurring casualties.

00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:43.082
So Edward Teach redesigned
himself as Blackbeard

00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:45.358
by playing the part of a merciless brute.

00:02:45.794 --> 00:02:49.819
He wore heavy jackets and big hats
to accentuate his height.

00:02:49.843 --> 00:02:53.338
He grew the bushy black beard
that obscured his face.

00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:56.909
He slung braces of pistols
on either shoulder.

00:02:56.933 --> 00:03:00.831
He even attached matches to the brim
of his hat and set them alight,

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:04.985
so they sizzled menacingly
whenever his ship was poised to attack.

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.581
And like many pirates of that era,

00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:10.494
he flew a flag that bore
the macabre symbols

00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:13.978
of a human skull
and a pair of crossed bones,

00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:19.693
because those motifs had signified death
in so many cultures for centuries,

00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:22.579
that their meaning
was instantly recognizable,

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:26.143
even in the lawless, illiterate
world of the high seas:

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:28.643
surrender or you'll suffer.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.922
So of course, all his sensible
victims surrendered on sight.

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:33.976
Put like that,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.675
it's easy to see why Edward Teach
and his fellow pirates

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:43.174
could be seen as pioneers
of modern communications design,

00:03:43.198 --> 00:03:45.122
and why their deadly symbol --

00:03:45.146 --> 00:03:46.208
(Laughter)

00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:47.383
there's more --

00:03:47.407 --> 00:03:50.392
why their deadly symbol
of the skull and crossbones

00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:52.706
was a precursor of today's logos,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.077
rather like the big red letters
standing behind me,

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.280
but of course with a different message.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.308
(Laughter)

00:03:59.332 --> 00:04:02.342
Yet design was also used to nobler ends

00:04:02.366 --> 00:04:06.580
by an equally brilliant and equally
improbable designer,

00:04:06.604 --> 00:04:10.440
the 19th-century British nurse,
Florence Nightingale.

00:04:10.464 --> 00:04:14.783
Her mission was to provide
decent healthcare for everyone.

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:19.783
Nightingale was born into a rather
grand, very wealthy British family,

00:04:19.807 --> 00:04:23.848
who were horrified when she volunteered
to work in military hospitals

00:04:23.872 --> 00:04:25.506
during the Crimean War.

00:04:25.963 --> 00:04:28.292
Once there, she swiftly realized

00:04:28.316 --> 00:04:31.929
that more patients were dying
of infections that they caught there,

00:04:31.953 --> 00:04:33.921
in the filthy, fetid wards,

00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:35.698
than they were of battle wounds.

00:04:35.722 --> 00:04:40.008
So she campaigned
for cleaner, lighter, airier clinics

00:04:40.032 --> 00:04:41.788
to be designed and built.

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.574
Back in Britain,

00:04:43.598 --> 00:04:45.088
she mounted another campaign,

00:04:45.112 --> 00:04:47.170
this time for civilian hospitals,

00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:51.067
and insisted that the same design
principles were applied to them.

00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:54.248
The Nightingale ward, as it is called,

00:04:54.272 --> 00:04:57.952
dominated hospital design
for decades to come,

00:04:57.976 --> 00:05:01.018
and elements of it are still used today.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.089
But by then,

00:05:03.113 --> 00:05:06.141
design was seen as a tool
of the Industrial Age.

00:05:06.165 --> 00:05:08.891
It was formalized and professionalized,

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:11.408
but it was restricted to specific roles

00:05:11.432 --> 00:05:14.510
and generally applied in pursuit
of commercial goals

00:05:14.534 --> 00:05:16.809
rather than being used intuitively,

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:21.059
as Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard
and Ying Zheng had done.

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:22.882
By the 20th century,

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.919
this commercial ethos was so powerful,

00:05:25.943 --> 00:05:28.467
that any designers who deviated from it

00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:32.098
risked being seen as cranks
or subversives.

00:05:32.538 --> 00:05:36.354
Now among them is one
of my great design heroes,

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.906
the brilliant LÃ¡szlÃ³ Moholy-Nagy.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.697
He was the Hungarian artist and designer

00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:45.977
whose experiments with the impact
of technology on daily life

00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:47.167
were so powerful

00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:50.491
that they still influence
the design of the digital images

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:53.237
we see on our phone and computer screens.

00:05:53.658 --> 00:05:58.355
He radicalized the Bauhaus Design
School in 1920s Germany,

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.126
and yet some of his former
colleagues shunned him

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.768
when he struggled to open a new
Bauhaus in Chicago years later.

00:06:06.194 --> 00:06:10.408
Moholy's ideas were as bold
and incisive as ever,

00:06:10.432 --> 00:06:14.159
but his approach to design
was too experimental,

00:06:14.183 --> 00:06:17.667
as was his insistence
on seeing it, as he put it,

00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:21.990
as an attitude, not a profession
to be in tune with the times.

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:24.635
And sadly, the same applied

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:29.143
to another design maverick:
Richard Buckminster Fuller.

00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:32.857
He was yet another
brilliant design visionary

00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:34.298
and design activist,

00:06:34.322 --> 00:06:38.886
who was completely committed
to designing a sustainable society

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.790
in such a forward-thinking way

00:06:40.814 --> 00:06:44.154
that he started talking about
the importance of environmentalism

00:06:44.178 --> 00:06:46.931
in design in the 1920s.

00:06:47.632 --> 00:06:50.085
Now he, despite his efforts,

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:54.842
was routinely mocked as a crank
by many in the design establishment,

00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:56.034
and admittedly,

00:06:56.058 --> 00:06:57.851
some of his experiments failed,

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.869
like the flying car
that never got off the ground.

00:07:00.893 --> 00:07:02.941
And yet, the geodesic dome,

00:07:02.965 --> 00:07:06.289
his design formula to build
an emergency shelter

00:07:06.313 --> 00:07:08.994
from scraps of wood, metal, plastic,

00:07:09.018 --> 00:07:12.264
bits of tree, old blankets,
plastic sheeting --

00:07:12.288 --> 00:07:15.035
just about anything
that's available at the time --

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:18.630
is one of the greatest feats
of humanitarian design,

00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:21.317
and has provided sorely needed refuge

00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:24.564
to many, many people
in desperate circumstances

00:07:24.588 --> 00:07:25.819
ever since.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:30.484
Now, it was the courage
and verve of radical designers

00:07:30.508 --> 00:07:32.360
like Bucky and Moholy

00:07:32.384 --> 00:07:34.657
that drew me to design.

00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:38.717
I began my career as a news journalist
and foreign correspondent.

00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:42.159
I wrote about politics, economics
and corporate affairs,

00:07:42.183 --> 00:07:46.009
and I could have chosen
to specialize in any of those fields.

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:47.777
But I picked design,

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:51.509
because I believe it's one of the most
powerful tools at our disposal

00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:53.952
to improve our quality of life.

00:07:55.755 --> 00:07:58.333
Thank you, fellow TED design buffs.

00:07:58.357 --> 00:08:00.021
(Applause)

00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:04.453
And greatly as I admire the achievements
of professional designers,

00:08:04.477 --> 00:08:07.072
which have been extraordinary and immense,

00:08:07.096 --> 00:08:08.557
I also believe

00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:12.074
that design benefits hugely
from the originality,

00:08:12.098 --> 00:08:13.416
the lateral thinking

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.155
and the resourcefulness
of its rebels and renegades.

00:08:17.683 --> 00:08:21.629
And we're living at a remarkable
moment in design,

00:08:21.653 --> 00:08:26.457
because this is a time when the two camps
are coming closer together.

00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:30.772
Because even very basic advances
in digital technology

00:08:30.796 --> 00:08:35.080
have enabled them to operate
increasingly independently,

00:08:35.104 --> 00:08:37.518
in or out of a commercial context,

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:42.591
to pursue ever more ambitious
and eclectic objectives.

00:08:42.615 --> 00:08:44.261
So in theory,

00:08:44.285 --> 00:08:49.572
basic platforms like crowdfunding,
cloud computing, social media

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:53.040
are giving greater freedom
to professional designers

00:08:53.064 --> 00:08:56.549
and giving more resources
for the improvisational ones,

00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:57.730
and hopefully,

00:08:57.754 --> 00:09:00.259
a more receptive response to their ideas.

00:09:00.671 --> 00:09:04.838
Now, some of my favorite
examples of this are in Africa,

00:09:04.862 --> 00:09:06.989
where a new generation of designers

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:10.558
are developing incredible
Internet of Things technologies

00:09:10.582 --> 00:09:15.186
to fulfill Florence Nightingale's dream
of improving healthcare

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.758
in countries where more people
now have access to cell phones

00:09:18.782 --> 00:09:20.967
than to clean, running water.

00:09:20.991 --> 00:09:23.618
And among them is Arthur Zang.

00:09:23.642 --> 00:09:26.512
He's a young, Cameroonian design engineer

00:09:26.536 --> 00:09:30.681
who has a adapted a tablet
computer into the Cardiopad,

00:09:30.705 --> 00:09:33.128
a mobile heart-monitoring device.

00:09:33.152 --> 00:09:37.493
It can be used to monitor the hearts
of patients in remote, rural areas.

00:09:37.517 --> 00:09:40.163
The data is then sent
on a cellular network

00:09:40.187 --> 00:09:43.217
to well-equipped hospitals
hundreds of miles away

00:09:43.241 --> 00:09:44.417
for analysis.

00:09:44.441 --> 00:09:47.746
And if any problems are spotted
by the specialists there,

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.994
a suitable course of treatment
is recommended.

00:09:51.018 --> 00:09:53.329
And this of course saves many patients

00:09:53.353 --> 00:09:58.558
from making long, arduous, expensive
and often pointless journeys

00:09:58.582 --> 00:09:59.900
to those hospitals,

00:09:59.924 --> 00:10:02.203
and makes it much, much likelier

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.828
that their hearts
will actually be checked.

00:10:05.298 --> 00:10:08.620
Arthur Zang started working
on the Cardiopad eight years ago,

00:10:08.644 --> 00:10:11.367
in his final year at university.

00:10:11.391 --> 00:10:14.806
But he failed to persuade
any conventional sources

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.257
to give him investment to get
the project off the ground.

00:10:18.281 --> 00:10:20.154
He posted the idea on Facebook,

00:10:20.178 --> 00:10:22.834
where a Cameroonian
government official saw it

00:10:22.858 --> 00:10:25.811
and managed to secure
a government grant for him.

00:10:26.119 --> 00:10:29.155
He's now developing
not only the Cardiopad,

00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:33.807
but other mobile medical devices
to treat different conditions.

00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:35.477
And he isn't alone,

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:40.424
because there are many other
inspiring and enterprising designers

00:10:40.448 --> 00:10:44.340
who are also pursuing
extraordinary projects of their own.

00:10:44.364 --> 00:10:47.910
And I'm going to finish
by looking at just a few of them.

00:10:47.934 --> 00:10:50.189
One is Peek Vision.

00:10:50.213 --> 00:10:53.288
This is a group of doctors
and designers in Kenya,

00:10:53.312 --> 00:10:56.521
who've developed an Internet of Things
technology of their own,

00:10:56.545 --> 00:10:59.146
as a portable eye examination kit.

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:01.561
Then there's Gabriel Maher,

00:11:01.585 --> 00:11:03.659
who is developing a new design language

00:11:03.683 --> 00:11:08.803
to enable us to articulate the subtleties
of our changing gender identities,

00:11:08.827 --> 00:11:11.712
without recourse
to traditional stereotypes.

00:11:11.736 --> 00:11:16.003
All of these designers and many more
are pursuing their dreams,

00:11:16.027 --> 00:11:18.653
by the making the most
of their newfound freedom,

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.575
with the discipline
of professional designers

00:11:21.599 --> 00:11:24.501
and the resourcefulness
of rebels and renegades.

00:11:24.525 --> 00:11:26.587
And we all stand to benefit.

00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:27.774
Thank you.

00:11:27.798 --> 00:11:31.317
(Applause)
