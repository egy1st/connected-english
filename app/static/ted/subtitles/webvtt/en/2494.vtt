00:00:00.844 --> 00:00:03.306
So this is a talk about gene drives,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.883
but I'm going to start
by telling you a brief story.

00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:09.844
20 years ago, a biologist
named Anthony James

00:00:09.868 --> 00:00:12.187
got obsessed with the idea
of making mosquitos

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.790
that didn't transmit malaria.

00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:19.739
It was a great idea,
and pretty much a complete failure.

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:23.256
For one thing, it turned out
to be really hard

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.287
to make a malaria-resistant mosquito.

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:29.913
James managed it, finally,
just a few years ago,

00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:32.008
by adding some genes
that make it impossible

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.746
for the malaria parasite
to survive inside the mosquito.

00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:37.373
But that just created another problem.

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:40.885
Now that you've got
a malaria-resistant mosquito,

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.495
how do you get it to replace
all the malaria-carrying mosquitos?

00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:47.580
There are a couple options,

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:49.627
but plan A was basically to breed up

00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.738
a bunch of the new
genetically-engineered mosquitos

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:54.088
release them into the wild

00:00:54.112 --> 00:00:56.079
and hope that they pass on their genes.

00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:58.787
The problem was that you'd have to release

00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:03.111
literally 10 times the number
of native mosquitos to work.

00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:05.222
So in a village with 10,000 mosquitos,

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:07.325
you release an extra 100,000.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.379
As you might guess,

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:12.157
this was not a very popular strategy
with the villagers.

00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:13.331
(Laughter)

00:01:14.963 --> 00:01:18.667
Then, last January,
Anthony James got an email

00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:20.642
from a biologist named Ethan Bier.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.259
Bier said that he
and his grad student Valentino Gantz

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:27.227
had stumbled on a tool
that could not only guarantee

00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:29.925
that a particular genetic trait
would be inherited,

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:32.028
but that it would spread
incredibly quickly.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:35.400
If they were right,
it would basically solve the problem

00:01:35.424 --> 00:01:37.805
that he and James had been
working on for 20 years.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.108
As a test, they engineered two mosquitos
to carry the anti-malaria gene

00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:45.291
and also this new tool, a gene drive,

00:01:45.315 --> 00:01:46.806
which I'll explain in a minute.

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.839
Finally, they set it up
so that any mosquitos

00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:51.801
that had inherited the anti-malaria gene

00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:55.824
wouldn't have the usual white eyes,
but would instead have red eyes.

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:58.732
That was pretty much just for convenience

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:01.293
so they could tell just at a glance
which was which.

00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:04.949
So they took their two
anti-malarial, red-eyed mosquitos

00:02:04.973 --> 00:02:07.632
and put them in a box
with 30 ordinary white-eyed ones,

00:02:07.656 --> 00:02:08.830
and let them breed.

00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:13.240
In two generations, those had produced
3,800 grandchildren.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:16.010
That is not the surprising part.

00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:18.638
This is the surprising part:

00:02:18.662 --> 00:02:21.569
given that you started
with just two red-eyed mosquitos

00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:22.927
and 30 white-eyed ones,

00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:25.712
you expect mostly white-eyed descendants.

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:29.538
Instead, when James opened the box,

00:02:29.562 --> 00:02:32.903
all 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes.

00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:35.355
When I asked Ethan Bier about this moment,

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.894
he became so excited that he was literally
shouting into the phone.

00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:42.049
That's because getting
only red-eyed mosquitos

00:02:42.073 --> 00:02:45.021
violates a rule that is the absolute
cornerstone of biology,

00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:46.287
Mendelian genetics.

00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:48.081
I'll keep this quick,

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:50.869
but Mendelian genetics
says when a male and a female mate,

00:02:50.893 --> 00:02:53.535
their baby inherits half
of its DNA from each parent.

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:57.154
So if our original mosquito was aa
and our new mosquito is aB,

00:02:57.178 --> 00:02:58.980
where B is the anti-malarial gene,

00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.391
the babies should come out
in four permutations:

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:03.988
aa, aB, aa, Ba.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:07.173
Instead, with the new gene drive,

00:03:07.197 --> 00:03:08.709
they all came out aB.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.452
Biologically, that shouldn't
even be possible.

00:03:12.476 --> 00:03:13.780
So what happened?

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.153
The first thing that happened

00:03:16.177 --> 00:03:19.447
was the arrival of a gene-editing tool
known as CRISPR in 2012.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.811
Many of you have probably
heard about CRISPR,

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:26.136
so I'll just say briefly that CRISPR
is a tool that allows researchers

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.739
to edit genes very precisely,
easily and quickly.

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:33.262
It does this by harnessing a mechanism
that already existed in bacteria.

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:35.912
Basically, there's a protein
that acts like a scissors

00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:37.170
and cuts the DNA,

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:39.677
and there's an RNA molecule
that directs the scissors

00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:41.419
to any point on the genome you want.

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:44.133
The result is basically
a word processor for genes.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.783
You can take an entire gene
out, put one in,

00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:49.252
or even edit just a single
letter within a gene.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.599
And you can do it in nearly any species.

00:03:53.328 --> 00:03:57.042
OK, remember how I said that gene drives
originally had two problems?

00:03:57.835 --> 00:04:00.955
The first was that it was hard
to engineer a mosquito

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.366
to be malaria-resistant.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.517
That's basically gone now,
thanks to CRISPR.

00:04:05.117 --> 00:04:06.879
But the other problem was logistical.

00:04:07.307 --> 00:04:09.109
How do you get your trait to spread?

00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:11.672
This is where it gets clever.

00:04:12.943 --> 00:04:16.545
A couple years ago, a biologist
at Harvard named Kevin Esvelt

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:17.919
wondered what would happen

00:04:17.943 --> 00:04:21.570
if you made it so that
CRISPR inserted not only your new gene

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:24.435
but also the machinery
that does the cutting and pasting.

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:29.073
In other words, what if CRISPR
also copied and pasted itself.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:33.276
You'd end up with a perpetual
motion machine for gene editing.

00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:36.192
And that's exactly what happened.

00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:39.915
This CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt created

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:43.582
not only guarantees
that a trait will get passed on,

00:04:43.606 --> 00:04:46.044
but if it's used in the germline cells,

00:04:46.068 --> 00:04:48.644
it will automatically copy and paste
your new gene

00:04:48.668 --> 00:04:51.314
into both chromosomes
of every single individual.

00:04:51.743 --> 00:04:54.140
It's like a global search and replace,

00:04:54.164 --> 00:04:57.385
or in science terms, it makes
a heterozygous trait homozygous.

00:04:59.045 --> 00:05:01.656
So, what does this mean?

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.404
For one thing, it means we have
a very powerful,

00:05:04.428 --> 00:05:07.085
but also somewhat alarming new tool.

00:05:08.576 --> 00:05:11.465
Up until now, the fact that gene drives
didn't work very well

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:12.972
was actually kind of a relief.

00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:16.107
Normally when we mess around
with an organism's genes,

00:05:16.131 --> 00:05:18.480
we make that thing
less evolutionarily fit.

00:05:18.504 --> 00:05:21.337
So biologists can make
all the mutant fruit flies they want

00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:22.614
without worrying about it.

00:05:22.638 --> 00:05:25.645
If some escape, natural selection
just takes care of them.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.973
What's remarkable and powerful
and frightening about gene drives

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:31.757
is that that will no longer be true.

00:05:33.092 --> 00:05:36.656
Assuming that your trait does not have
a big evolutionary handicap,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.759
like a mosquito that can't fly,

00:05:38.783 --> 00:05:42.236
the CRISPR-based gene drive
will spread the change relentlessly

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.266
until it is in every single individual
in the population.

00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:49.990
Now, it isn't easy to make
a gene drive that works that well,

00:05:50.014 --> 00:05:52.188
but James and Esvelt think that we can.

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:57.163
The good news is that this opens
the door to some remarkable things.

00:05:57.187 --> 00:05:59.091
If you put an anti-malarial gene drive

00:05:59.115 --> 00:06:01.315
in just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes,

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:03.091
the species that transmits malaria,

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:07.607
researchers estimate that it would spread
to the entire population in a year.

00:06:08.178 --> 00:06:11.047
So in a year, you could virtually
eliminate malaria.

00:06:11.455 --> 00:06:15.327
In practice, we're still a few years out
from being able to do that,

00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:18.069
but still, a 1,000 children
a day die of malaria.

00:06:18.093 --> 00:06:20.283
In a year, that number
could be almost zero.

00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:23.862
The same goes for dengue fever,
chikungunya, yellow fever.

00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:26.616
And it gets better.

00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:29.691
Say you want to get rid
of an invasive species,

00:06:29.715 --> 00:06:31.838
like get Asian carp
out of the Great Lakes.

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.458
All you have to do is release a gene drive

00:06:34.482 --> 00:06:36.799
that makes the fish produce
only male offspring.

00:06:37.386 --> 00:06:41.584
In a few generations,
there'll be no females left, no more carp.

00:06:41.608 --> 00:06:44.687
In theory, this means we could restore
hundreds of native species

00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:46.378
that have been pushed to the brink.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.697
OK, that's the good news,

00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:52.013
this is the bad news.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.098
Gene drives are so effective

00:06:55.122 --> 00:06:58.947
that even an accidental release
could change an entire species,

00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:00.161
and often very quickly.

00:07:01.178 --> 00:07:03.304
Anthony James took good precautions.

00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:05.494
He bred his mosquitos
in a bio-containment lab

00:07:05.518 --> 00:07:08.106
and he also used a species
that's not native to the US

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.685
so that even if some did escape,

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:12.724
they'd just die off, there'd be nothing
for them to mate with.

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:16.771
But it's also true that if a dozen
Asian carp with the all-male gene drive

00:07:16.795 --> 00:07:20.724
accidentally got carried
from the Great Lakes back to Asia,

00:07:20.748 --> 00:07:24.177
they could potentially wipe out
the native Asian carp population.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.842
And that's not so unlikely,
given how connected our world is.

00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:31.437
In fact, it's why we have
an invasive species problem.

00:07:31.912 --> 00:07:33.080
And that's fish.

00:07:33.428 --> 00:07:36.016
Things like mosquitos and fruit flies,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.000
there's literally no way to contain them.

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.135
They cross borders
and oceans all the time.

00:07:41.754 --> 00:07:43.936
OK, the other piece of bad news

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.278
is that a gene drive
might not stay confined

00:07:46.302 --> 00:07:48.115
to what we call the target species.

00:07:48.556 --> 00:07:50.055
That's because of gene flow,

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:52.676
which is a fancy way of saying
that neighboring species

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.948
sometimes interbreed.

00:07:53.972 --> 00:07:57.123
If that happens, it's possible
a gene drive could cross over,

00:07:57.147 --> 00:07:59.674
like Asian carp could infect
some other kind of carp.

00:07:59.698 --> 00:08:03.413
That's not so bad if your drive
just promotes a trait, like eye color.

00:08:03.437 --> 00:08:05.684
In fact, there's a decent
chance that we'll see

00:08:05.708 --> 00:08:08.279
a wave of very weird fruit flies
in the near future.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.653
But it could be a disaster

00:08:10.677 --> 00:08:13.581
if your drive is deigned
to eliminate the species entirely.

00:08:14.351 --> 00:08:17.879
The last worrisome thing
is that the technology to do this,

00:08:17.903 --> 00:08:21.594
to genetically engineer an organism
and include a gene drive,

00:08:21.618 --> 00:08:24.952
is something that basically any lab
in the world can do.

00:08:24.976 --> 00:08:26.316
An undergraduate can do it.

00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:30.491
A talented high schooler
with some equipment can do it.

00:08:32.526 --> 00:08:34.835
Now, I'm guessing
that this sounds terrifying.

00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:37.557
(Laughter)

00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:40.471
Interestingly though,
nearly every scientist I talk to

00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:44.376
seemed to think that gene drives were not
actually that frightening or dangerous.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.028
Partly because they believe
that scientists will be

00:08:47.052 --> 00:08:49.256
very cautious and responsible
about using them.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.294
(Laughter)

00:08:50.318 --> 00:08:51.548
So far, that's been true.

00:08:52.302 --> 00:08:54.998
But gene drives also have
some actual limitations.

00:08:55.022 --> 00:08:58.331
So for one thing, they work
only in sexually reproducing species.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:02.132
So thank goodness, they can't be used
to engineer viruses or bacteria.

00:09:02.156 --> 00:09:05.346
Also, the trait spreads
only with each successive generation.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.363
So changing or eliminating a population

00:09:07.387 --> 00:09:10.713
is practical only if that species
has a fast reproductive cycle,

00:09:10.737 --> 00:09:13.537
like insects or maybe
small vertebrates like mice or fish.

00:09:14.438 --> 00:09:16.699
In elephants or people,
it would take centuries

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.103
for a trait to spread
widely enough to matter.

00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:25.221
Also, even with CRISPR, it's not that easy
to engineer a truly devastating trait.

00:09:26.079 --> 00:09:27.808
Say you wanted to make a fruit fly

00:09:27.832 --> 00:09:30.387
that feeds on ordinary fruit
instead of rotting fruit,

00:09:30.411 --> 00:09:33.044
with the aim of sabotaging
American agriculture.

00:09:33.068 --> 00:09:34.598
First, you'd have to figure out

00:09:34.622 --> 00:09:37.394
which genes control
what the fly wants to eat,

00:09:37.418 --> 00:09:39.965
which is already a very long
and complicated project.

00:09:40.489 --> 00:09:43.793
Then you'd have to alter those genes
to change the fly's behavior

00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:45.355
to whatever you'd want it to be,

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:48.180
which is an even longer
and more complicated project.

00:09:48.204 --> 00:09:49.522
And it might not even work,

00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:52.040
because the genes
that control behavior are complex.

00:09:52.064 --> 00:09:54.072
So if you're a terrorist
and have to choose

00:09:54.096 --> 00:09:56.454
between starting a grueling
basic research program

00:09:56.478 --> 00:10:00.005
that will require years of meticulous
lab work and still might not pan out,

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:01.376
or just blowing stuff up?

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.055
You'll probably choose the later.

00:10:03.498 --> 00:10:05.918
This is especially true
because at least in theory,

00:10:05.942 --> 00:10:09.076
it should be pretty easy
to build what's called a reversal drive.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.798
That's one that basically overwrites
the change made by the first gene drive.

00:10:12.822 --> 00:10:15.116
So if you don't like
the effects of a change,

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.973
you can just release a second drive
that will cancel it out,

00:10:17.997 --> 00:10:19.147
at least in theory.

00:10:21.374 --> 00:10:23.096
OK, so where does this leave us?

00:10:24.604 --> 00:10:28.199
We now have the ability
to change entire species at will.

00:10:29.017 --> 00:10:30.183
Should we?

00:10:30.552 --> 00:10:31.917
Are we gods now?

00:10:33.972 --> 00:10:35.305
I'm not sure I'd say that.

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:37.321
But I would say this:

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:40.187
first, some very smart people

00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:43.067
are even now debating
how to regulate gene drives.

00:10:43.598 --> 00:10:46.162
At the same time,
some other very smart people

00:10:46.186 --> 00:10:48.297
are working hard to create safeguards,

00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:51.873
like gene drives that self-regulate
or peter out after a few generations.

00:10:52.644 --> 00:10:53.844
That's great.

00:10:54.313 --> 00:10:56.860
But this technology still requires
a conversation.

00:10:58.059 --> 00:10:59.789
And given the nature of gene drives,

00:10:59.813 --> 00:11:01.503
that conversation has to be global.

00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:04.838
What if Kenya wants to use a drive
but Tanzania doesn't?

00:11:05.241 --> 00:11:08.608
Who decides whether to release
a gene drive that can fly?

00:11:10.874 --> 00:11:12.828
I don't have the answer to that question.

00:11:13.618 --> 00:11:15.626
All we can do going forward, I think,

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.484
is talk honestly
about the risks and benefits

00:11:18.508 --> 00:11:20.730
and take responsibility for our choices.

00:11:21.817 --> 00:11:25.730
By that I mean, not just the choice
to use a gene drive,

00:11:25.754 --> 00:11:27.753
but also the choice not to use one.

00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:32.088
Humans have a tendency to assume
that the safest option

00:11:32.112 --> 00:11:33.904
is to preserve the status quo.

00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:36.477
But that's not always the case.

00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:41.112
Gene drives have risks,
and those need to be discussed,

00:11:41.136 --> 00:11:44.286
but malaria exists now
and kills 1,000 people a day.

00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:48.541
To combat it, we spray pesticides
that do grave damage to other species,

00:11:48.565 --> 00:11:50.135
including amphibians and birds.

00:11:51.668 --> 00:11:54.532
So when you hear about gene drives
in the coming months,

00:11:54.556 --> 00:11:56.810
and trust me, you will
be hearing about them,

00:11:56.834 --> 00:11:58.378
remember that.

00:11:58.402 --> 00:12:00.422
It can be frightening to act,

00:12:00.446 --> 00:12:02.583
but sometimes, not acting is worse.

00:12:04.746 --> 00:12:12.566
