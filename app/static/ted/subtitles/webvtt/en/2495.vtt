00:00:00.806 --> 00:00:02.881
Imagine that you invented a device

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:04.577
that can record my memories,

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.638
my dreams, my ideas,

00:00:06.662 --> 00:00:08.325
and transmit them to your brain.

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:11.830
That would be a game-changing
technology, right?

00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:14.892
But in fact, we already
possess this device,

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:17.560
and it's called human communication system

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.432
and effective storytelling.

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:22.334
To understand how this device works,

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:24.773
we have to look into our brains.

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:28.383
And we have to formulate the question
in a slightly different manner.

00:00:28.407 --> 00:00:29.870
Now we have to ask

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.925
how these neuron patterns in my brain

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.151
that are associated
with my memories and ideas

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:38.694
are transmitted into your brains.

00:00:39.702 --> 00:00:43.070
And we think there are two factors
that enable us to communicate.

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:47.149
First, your brain is now
physically coupled to the sound wave

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:49.648
that I'm transmitting to your brain.

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:53.050
And second, we developed
a common neural protocol

00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:54.832
that enabled us to communicate.

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:56.721
So how do we know that?

00:00:57.292 --> 00:00:59.185
In my lab in Princeton,

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.714
we bring people to the fMRI scanner
and we scan their brains

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:06.638
while they are either telling
or listening to real-life stories.

00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:09.286
And to give you a sense
of the stimulus we are using,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.294
let me play 20 seconds
from a story that we used,

00:01:13.318 --> 00:01:15.642
told by a very talented storyteller,

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.817
Jim O'Grady.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.577
(Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out
my story and I know it's good,

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.891
and then I start to make it better --

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:26.399
(Laughter)

00:01:26.423 --> 00:01:28.758
by adding an element of embellishment.

00:01:29.502 --> 00:01:32.810
Reporters call this "making shit up."

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:35.105
(Laughter)

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:38.851
And they recommend
against crossing that line.

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:44.812
But I had just seen the line crossed
between a high-powered dean

00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:46.262
and assault with a pastry.

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:47.778
And I kinda liked it."

00:01:47.802 --> 00:01:50.176
Uri Hasson: OK, so now
let's look into your brain

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.428
and see what's happening
when you listen to these kinds of stories.

00:01:53.452 --> 00:01:57.496
And let's start simple -- let's start
with one listener and one brain area:

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.009
the auditory cortex that processes
the sounds that come from the ear.

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:03.477
And as you can see,
in this particular brain area,

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.993
the responses are going up and down
as the story is unfolding.

00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:08.610
Now we can take these responses

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:11.435
and compare them to the responses
in other listeners

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.934
in the same brain area.

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.125
And we can ask:

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.384
How similar are the responses
across all listeners?

00:02:18.018 --> 00:02:20.380
So here you can see five listeners.

00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:24.436
And we start to scan their brains
before the story starts,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.999
when they're simply lying in the dark
and waiting for the story to begin.

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.177
As you can see,

00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:31.959
the brain area is going up and down
in each one of them,

00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:33.758
but the responses are very different,

00:02:33.782 --> 00:02:35.449
and not in sync.

00:02:35.473 --> 00:02:38.179
However, immediately
as the story is starting,

00:02:38.203 --> 00:02:39.889
something amazing is happening.

00:02:40.857 --> 00:02:43.786
(Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story
and I know it's good,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.338
and then I start to make it --

00:02:45.362 --> 00:02:48.659
UH: Suddenly, you can see
that the responses in all of the subjects

00:02:48.683 --> 00:02:49.835
lock to the story,

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.288
and now they are going up and down
in a very similar way

00:02:53.312 --> 00:02:54.866
across all listeners.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.939
And in fact, this is exactly
what is happening now in your brains

00:02:57.963 --> 00:03:00.836
when you listen to my sound speaking.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.868
We call this effect "neural entrainment."

00:03:04.374 --> 00:03:06.686
And to explain to you
what is neural entrainment,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.320
let me first explain
what is physical entrainment.

00:03:10.076 --> 00:03:12.826
So, we'll look and see five metronomes.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.846
Think of these five metronomes
as five brains.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.620
And similar to the listeners
before the story starts,

00:03:18.644 --> 00:03:20.457
these metronomes are going to click,

00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:22.640
but they're going to click out of phase.

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:27.455
(Clicking)

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.480
Now see what will happen
when I connect them together

00:03:30.504 --> 00:03:32.645
by placing them on these two cylinders.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.101
(Clicking)

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:39.737
Now these two cylinders start to rotate.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.890
This rotation vibration
is going through the wood

00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:45.919
and is going to couple
all the metronomes together.

00:03:45.943 --> 00:03:47.555
And now listen to the click.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.246
(Synchronized clicking)

00:03:57.834 --> 00:04:00.458
This is what you call
physical entrainment.

00:04:00.482 --> 00:04:02.725
Now let's go back to the brain and ask:

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.893
What's driving this neural entrainment?

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:07.702
Is it simply the sounds
that the speaker is producing?

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:09.049
Or maybe it's the words.

00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:12.719
Or maybe it's the meaning
that the speaker is trying to convey.

00:04:12.743 --> 00:04:15.503
So to test it, we did
the following experiment.

00:04:15.527 --> 00:04:18.728
First, we took the story
and played it backwards.

00:04:18.752 --> 00:04:21.878
And that preserved many
of the original auditory features,

00:04:21.902 --> 00:04:23.915
but removed the meaning.

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:25.610
And it sounds something like that.

00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:30.772
(Audio) JO: (Unintelligible)

00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:33.648
And we flashed colors in the two brains

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:37.584
to indicate brain areas that respond
very similarly across people.

00:04:37.608 --> 00:04:38.762
And as you can see,

00:04:38.786 --> 00:04:42.554
this incoming sound induced entrainment
or alignment in all of the brains

00:04:42.578 --> 00:04:45.310
in auditory cortices
that process the sounds,

00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:47.558
but it didn't spread
deeper into the brain.

00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:51.455
Now we can take these sounds
and build words out of it.

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.135
So if we take Jim O'Grady
and scramble the words,

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.399
we'll get a list of words.

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:57.685
(Audio) JO: ... an animal ...
assorted facts ...

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:00.601
and right on ... pie man ...
potentially ... my stories

00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:03.567
UH: And you can see that these words
start to induce alignment

00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:06.196
in early language areas,
but not more than that.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.037
Now we can take the words
and start to build sentences out of them.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.561
(Audio) JO: And they recommend
against crossing that line.

00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:19.663
He says: "Dear Jim,
Good story. Nice details.

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:22.521
Didn't she only know
about him through me?"

00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:25.680
UH: Now you can see that the responses
in all the language areas

00:05:25.704 --> 00:05:27.395
that process the incoming language

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.798
become aligned or similar
across all listeners.

00:05:30.218 --> 00:05:34.895
However, only when we use
the full, engaging, coherent story

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.144
do the responses spread
deeper into the brain

00:05:37.168 --> 00:05:38.699
into higher-order areas,

00:05:38.723 --> 00:05:41.824
which include the frontal cortex
and the parietal cortex,

00:05:41.848 --> 00:05:44.436
and make all of them
respond very similarly.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.729
And we believe that these responses
in higher-order areas are induced

00:05:47.753 --> 00:05:49.879
or become similar across listeners

00:05:49.903 --> 00:05:52.643
because of the meaning
conveyed by the speaker,

00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:54.268
and not by words or sound.

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:57.350
And if we are right,
there's a strong prediction over here

00:05:57.374 --> 00:05:59.736
if I tell you the exact same ideas

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.404
using two very different sets of words,

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:04.979
your brain responses
will still be similar.

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:08.513
And to test it, we did
the following experiment in my lab.

00:06:09.142 --> 00:06:10.950
We took the English story

00:06:10.974 --> 00:06:13.110
and translated it to Russian.

00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:17.358
Now you have two different sounds
and linguistic systems

00:06:17.382 --> 00:06:19.676
that convey the exact same meaning.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.348
And you play the English story
to the English listeners

00:06:23.372 --> 00:06:25.724
and the Russian story
to the Russian listeners,

00:06:25.748 --> 00:06:28.793
and we can compare their responses
across the groups.

00:06:28.817 --> 00:06:32.388
And when we did that, we didn't see
responses that are similar

00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:34.693
in auditory cortices in language,

00:06:34.717 --> 00:06:37.095
because the language
and sound are very different.

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:39.887
However, you can see
that the responses in high-order areas

00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:42.415
were still similar
across these two groups.

00:06:43.068 --> 00:06:47.160
We believe this is because they understood
the story in a very similar way,

00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:51.210
as we confirmed, using a test
after the story ended.

00:06:52.321 --> 00:06:56.008
And we think that this alignment
is necessary for communication.

00:06:56.032 --> 00:06:58.658
For example, as you can tell,

00:06:58.682 --> 00:07:00.709
I am not a native English speaker.

00:07:00.733 --> 00:07:02.614
I grew up with another language,

00:07:02.638 --> 00:07:05.292
and the same might be for many
of you in the audience.

00:07:05.316 --> 00:07:07.315
And still, we can communicate.

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:08.490
How come?

00:07:08.514 --> 00:07:11.593
We think we can communicate
because we have this common code

00:07:11.617 --> 00:07:13.044
that presents meaning.

00:07:13.921 --> 00:07:17.367
So far, I've only talked about
what's happening in the listener's brain,

00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:19.638
in your brain, when
you're listening to talks.

00:07:19.662 --> 00:07:22.361
But what's happening
in the speaker's brain, in my brain,

00:07:22.385 --> 00:07:24.192
when I'm speaking to you?

00:07:24.216 --> 00:07:26.073
To look in the speaker's brain,

00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:29.193
we asked the speaker
to go into the scanner,

00:07:29.217 --> 00:07:30.819
we scan his brain

00:07:30.843 --> 00:07:34.850
and then compare his brain responses
to the brain responses of the listeners

00:07:34.874 --> 00:07:36.676
listening to the story.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.910
You have to remember that producing speech
and comprehending speech

00:07:40.934 --> 00:07:42.657
are very different processes.

00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:44.925
Here we're asking: How similar are they?

00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:47.571
To our surprise,

00:07:47.595 --> 00:07:52.466
we saw that all these complex
patterns within the listeners

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.197
actually came from the speaker brain.

00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:58.906
So production and comprehension
rely on very similar processes.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.502
And we also found

00:08:00.526 --> 00:08:04.232
the stronger the similarity
between the listener's brain

00:08:04.256 --> 00:08:05.755
and the speaker's brain,

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:07.684
the better the communication.

00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:11.673
So I know that if you
are completely confused now,

00:08:11.697 --> 00:08:13.718
and I do hope that this is not the case,

00:08:13.742 --> 00:08:16.135
your brain responses
are very different than mine.

00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:19.266
But I also know that if you really
understand me now,

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.181
then your brain ... and your brain
... and your brain

00:08:22.205 --> 00:08:23.933
are really similar to mine.

00:08:25.793 --> 00:08:28.888
Now, let's take all
this information together and ask:

00:08:28.912 --> 00:08:32.249
How can we use it to transmit
a memory that I have

00:08:32.273 --> 00:08:34.459
from my brain to your brains?

00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:37.155
So we did the following experiment.

00:08:37.648 --> 00:08:40.221
We let people watch,
for the first time in their life,

00:08:40.245 --> 00:08:44.379
a TV episode from the BBC series
"Sherlock," while we scanned their brains.

00:08:44.403 --> 00:08:47.204
And then we asked them
to go back to the scanner

00:08:47.228 --> 00:08:51.127
and tell the story to another person
that never watched the movie.

00:08:51.151 --> 00:08:52.811
So let's be specific.

00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:54.882
Think about this exact scene,

00:08:54.906 --> 00:08:57.490
when Sherlock is entering
the cab in London

00:08:57.514 --> 00:08:59.810
driven by the murderer he is looking for.

00:09:00.398 --> 00:09:02.894
With me, as a viewer,

00:09:02.918 --> 00:09:06.418
there is a specific brain pattern
in my brain when I watch it.

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:10.951
Now, the exact same pattern,
I can reactivate in my brain again

00:09:10.975 --> 00:09:14.631
by telling the word:
Sherlock, London, murderer.

00:09:15.369 --> 00:09:18.479
And when I'm transmitting
these words to your brains now,

00:09:18.503 --> 00:09:20.988
you have to reconstruct it in your mind.

00:09:21.012 --> 00:09:25.561
In fact, we see that pattern
emerging now in your brains.

00:09:25.585 --> 00:09:28.100
And we were really surprised to see

00:09:28.124 --> 00:09:30.379
that the pattern you have
now in your brains

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.315
when I'm describing to you these scenes

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:36.161
would be very similar to the pattern
I had when I watched this movie

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:38.323
a few months ago in the scanner.

00:09:38.347 --> 00:09:40.451
This starts to tell you
about the mechanism

00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:43.217
by which we can tell stories
and transmit information.

00:09:43.733 --> 00:09:45.609
Because, for example,

00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:49.145
now you're listening really hard
and trying to understand what I'm saying.

00:09:49.169 --> 00:09:50.719
And I know that it's not easy.

00:09:50.743 --> 00:09:54.779
But I hope that at one point
in the talk we clicked, and you got me.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:58.701
And I think that in a few hours,
a few days, a few months,

00:09:58.725 --> 00:10:00.869
you're going to meet someone at a party,

00:10:00.893 --> 00:10:04.441
and you're going to tell him
about this lecture,

00:10:04.465 --> 00:10:08.103
and suddenly it will be as if
he is standing now here with us.

00:10:08.127 --> 00:10:10.977
Now you can see
how we can take this mechanism

00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:14.932
and try to transmit memories
and knowledge across people,

00:10:14.956 --> 00:10:17.003
which is wonderful, right?

00:10:17.027 --> 00:10:20.194
But our ability to communicate
relies on our ability

00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:22.784
to have common ground.

00:10:22.808 --> 00:10:24.013
Because, for example,

00:10:24.037 --> 00:10:27.804
if I'm going to use the British synonym

00:10:27.828 --> 00:10:30.206
"hackney carriage" instead of "cab,"

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:34.269
I know that I'm going to be misaligned
with most of you in the audience.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.911
This alignment depends
not only on our ability

00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:38.969
to understand the basic concept;

00:10:38.993 --> 00:10:43.788
it also depends on our ability to develop
common ground and understanding

00:10:43.812 --> 00:10:45.599
and shared belief systems.

00:10:45.623 --> 00:10:47.457
Because we know that in many cases,

00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:51.524
people understand the exact
same story in very different ways.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.501
So to test it in the lab,
we did the following experiment.

00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:59.020
We took a story by J.D. Salinger,

00:10:59.044 --> 00:11:03.379
in which a husband lost track
of his wife in the middle of a party,

00:11:03.403 --> 00:11:07.090
and he's calling his best friend, asking,
"Did you see my wife?"

00:11:07.836 --> 00:11:09.043
For half of the subjects,

00:11:09.067 --> 00:11:13.208
we said that the wife was having
an affair with the best friend.

00:11:13.232 --> 00:11:14.383
For the other half,

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:19.512
we said that the wife is loyal
and the husband is very jealous.

00:11:20.127 --> 00:11:22.815
This one sentence before the story started

00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:25.140
was enough to make the brain responses

00:11:25.164 --> 00:11:28.208
of all the people that believed
the wife was having an affair

00:11:28.232 --> 00:11:30.669
be very similar in these high-order areas

00:11:30.693 --> 00:11:32.915
and different than the other group.

00:11:32.939 --> 00:11:36.612
And if one sentence is enough
to make your brain similar

00:11:36.636 --> 00:11:38.239
to people that think like you

00:11:38.263 --> 00:11:41.216
and very different than people
that think differently than you,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.717
think how this effect is going
to be amplified in real life,

00:11:44.741 --> 00:11:47.633
when we are all listening
to the exact same news item

00:11:47.657 --> 00:11:51.405
after being exposed
day after day after day

00:11:51.429 --> 00:11:55.241
to different media channels,
like Fox News or The New York Times,

00:11:55.265 --> 00:11:58.378
that give us very different
perspectives on reality.

00:11:59.556 --> 00:12:00.909
So let me summarize.

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:03.618
If everything worked as planned tonight,

00:12:03.642 --> 00:12:07.941
I used my ability to vocalize sound
to be coupled to your brains.

00:12:07.965 --> 00:12:09.468
And I used this coupling

00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:13.333
to transmit my brain patterns associated
with my memories and ideas

00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:14.673
into your brains.

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:18.999
In this, I start to reveal
the hidden neural mechanism

00:12:19.023 --> 00:12:20.658
by which we communicate.

00:12:20.682 --> 00:12:23.649
And we know that in the future
it will enable us to improve

00:12:23.673 --> 00:12:25.663
and facilitate communication.

00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:27.805
But these studies also reveal

00:12:28.535 --> 00:12:31.821
that communication relies
on a common ground.

00:12:31.845 --> 00:12:34.307
And we have to be
really worried as a society

00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:38.367
if we lose this common ground
and our ability to speak with people

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:40.508
that are slightly different than us

00:12:40.532 --> 00:12:43.920
because we let a few very strong
media channels

00:12:43.944 --> 00:12:45.485
take control of the mic,

00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:49.284
and manipulate and control
the way we all think.

00:12:49.308 --> 00:12:52.209
And I'm not sure how to fix it
because I'm only a scientist.

00:12:52.233 --> 00:12:54.693
But maybe one way to do it

00:12:54.717 --> 00:12:57.364
is to go back to the more
natural way of communication,

00:12:57.388 --> 00:12:58.990
which is a dialogue,

00:12:59.014 --> 00:13:01.521
in which it's not only me
speaking to you now,

00:13:01.994 --> 00:13:04.210
but a more natural way of talking,

00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:07.511
in which I am speaking and I am listening,

00:13:07.535 --> 00:13:12.255
and together we are trying to come
to a common ground and new ideas.

00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:13.437
Because after all,

00:13:13.461 --> 00:13:17.125
the people we are coupled to
define who we are.

00:13:17.149 --> 00:13:19.538
And our desire to be coupled
to another brain

00:13:19.562 --> 00:13:24.079
is something very basic
that starts at a very early age.

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:28.290
So let me finish with an example
from my own private life

00:13:29.044 --> 00:13:33.355
that I think is a good example
of how coupling to other people

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:35.653
is really going to define who we are.

00:13:36.294 --> 00:13:39.368
This my son Jonathan at a very early age.

00:13:39.392 --> 00:13:43.542
See how he developed
a vocal game together with my wife,

00:13:43.566 --> 00:13:48.797
only from the desire and pure joy
of being coupled to another human being.

00:13:49.556 --> 00:13:54.473
(Both vocalizing)

00:14:02.915 --> 00:14:05.243
(Laughter)

00:14:05.267 --> 00:14:09.064
Now, think how the ability of my son

00:14:09.088 --> 00:14:11.850
to be coupled to us
and other people in his life

00:14:11.874 --> 00:14:14.732
is going to shape the man
he is going to become.

00:14:14.756 --> 00:14:17.171
And think how you change on a daily basis

00:14:17.195 --> 00:14:21.518
from the interaction and coupling
to other people in your life.

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:24.665
So keep being coupled to other people.

00:14:25.157 --> 00:14:26.706
Keep spreading your ideas,

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.974
because the sum of all of us
together, coupled,

00:14:29.998 --> 00:14:31.592
is greater than our parts.

00:14:31.616 --> 00:14:32.782
Thank you.

00:14:32.806 --> 00:14:38.468
(Applause)
