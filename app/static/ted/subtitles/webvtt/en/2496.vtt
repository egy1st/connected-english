00:00:00.976 --> 00:00:02.370
As a conceptual artist,

00:00:02.394 --> 00:00:06.702
I'm constantly looking for creative ways
to spark challenging conversations.

00:00:06.726 --> 00:00:10.425
I do this though painting, sculpture,
video and performance.

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:11.888
But regardless of the format,

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:15.364
two of my favorite materials
are history and dialogue.

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:18.235
In 2007, I created "Lotus,"

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.033
a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter,

00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:23.612
600-pound glass depiction
of a lotus blossom.

00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:27.406
In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol
for transcendence

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.858
and for purity of mind and spirit.

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:32.303
But a closer look at this lotus

00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:35.541
reveals each petal
to be the cross-section of a slave ship.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:39.660
This iconic diagram was taken
from a British slaving manual

00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:43.517
and later used by abolitionists to show
the atrocities of slavery.

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:46.509
In America, we don't like
to talk about slavery,

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.373
nor do we look at it as a global industry.

00:00:49.397 --> 00:00:51.025
But by using this Buddhist symbol,

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.652
I hope to universalize and transcend

00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:56.065
the history and trauma of black America

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.453
and encourage discussions
about our shared past.

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:04.128
To create "Lotus,"
we carved over 6,000 figures.

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:07.192
And this later led to a commission
by the City of New York

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:09.470
to create a 28-foot version in steel

00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:12.936
as a permanent installation
at the Eagle Academy for Young Men,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.098
a school for black and latino students,

00:01:15.122 --> 00:01:17.795
the two groups most affected
by this history.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.795
The same two groups are very affected
by a more recent phenomenon,

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.442
but let me digress.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.007
I've been collecting
wooden African figures

00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:28.515
from tourist shops and flea markets
around the world.

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.621
The authenticity and origin
of them is completely debatable,

00:01:31.645 --> 00:01:34.303
but people believe these
to be imbued with power,

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:35.659
or even magic.

00:01:35.683 --> 00:01:38.809
Only recently have I figured out
how to use this in my own work.

00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:46.221
(Gun shots)

00:01:53.253 --> 00:01:57.421
Since 2012, the world has witnessed
the killings of Trayvon Martin,

00:01:57.445 --> 00:02:01.185
Michael Brown, Eric Garner,
Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.169
and literally countless other
unarmed black citizens

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:05.622
at the hands of the police,

00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:08.454
who frequently walk away
with no punishment at all.

00:02:08.775 --> 00:02:10.804
In consideration of these victims

00:02:10.828 --> 00:02:12.638
and the several times that even I,

00:02:12.662 --> 00:02:15.135
a law-abiding, Ivy League professor,

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.623
have been targeted and harassed
at gunpoint by the police.

00:02:18.647 --> 00:02:22.301
I created this body of work
simply entitled "BAM."

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.888
It was important to erase
the identity of each of these figures,

00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:31.661
to make them all look the same
and easier to disregard.

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:33.885
To do this, I dip them in a thick,
brown wax

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.872
before taking them to a shooting range

00:02:35.896 --> 00:02:38.694
where I re-sculpted them using bullets.

00:02:39.098 --> 00:02:40.279
And it was fun,

00:02:40.303 --> 00:02:43.140
playing with big guns and
high-speed video cameras.

00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:46.821
But my reverence for these figures
kept me from actually pulling the trigger,

00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:49.503
somehow feeling as if I would
be shooting myself.

00:02:49.995 --> 00:02:53.225
Finally, my cameraman, Raul,
fired the shots.

00:02:54.503 --> 00:02:56.372
I then took the fragments of these

00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:59.924
and created molds,
and cast them first in wax,

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.852
and finally in bronze
like the image you see here,

00:03:03.876 --> 00:03:05.980
which bears the marks
of its violent creation

00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:07.812
like battle wounds or scars.

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.591
When I showed this work recently in Miami,

00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:13.400
a woman told me she felt
every gun shot to her soul.

00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:16.015
But she also felt that these artworks

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:18.039
memorialized the victims of these killings

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:21.252
as well as other victims of
racial violence throughout US history.

00:03:21.812 --> 00:03:24.846
But "Lotus" and "BAM" are larger
than just US history.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.734
While showing in Berlin last year,

00:03:26.758 --> 00:03:30.319
a philosophy student asked me
what prompted these recent killings.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.961
I showed him a photo
of a lynching postcard

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:34.350
from the early 1900s

00:03:34.374 --> 00:03:39.446
and reminded him that these killings
have been going on for over 500 years.

00:03:39.922 --> 00:03:41.828
But it's only through questions like his

00:03:41.852 --> 00:03:44.694
and more thoughtful dialogue
about history and race

00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:47.296
can we evolve as individuals and society.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.542
I hope my artwork creates a safe space

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:52.978
for this type of honest exchange

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:55.741
and an opportunity for people
to engage one another

00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:58.653
in real and necessary conversation.

00:03:58.751 --> 00:03:59.901
Thank you.

00:03:59.925 --> 00:04:06.388
(Applause)
