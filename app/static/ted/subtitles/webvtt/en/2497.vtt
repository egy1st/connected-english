00:00:02.014 --> 00:00:03.976
When I think about dreams,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.876
like many of you,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.585
I think about this picture.

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:12.875
I was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.113
step off the Lunar Module
onto the surface of the Moon.

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:20.684
I had never seen anything like it before,

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:22.946
and I've never seen
anything like it since.

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.613
We got to the Moon for one simple reason:

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:31.943
John Kennedy committed us to a deadline.

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:35.470
And in the absence of that deadline,

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.501
we would still be dreaming about it.

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:43.877
Leonard Bernstein said two things
are necessary for great achievement:

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:47.366
a plan and not quite enough time.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.520
(Laughter)

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:56.345
Deadlines and commitments

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:01.382
are the great and fading
lessons of Apollo.

00:01:02.514 --> 00:01:06.545
And they are what give the word
"moonshot" its meaning.

00:01:07.498 --> 00:01:12.220
And our world is in desperate need
of political leaders

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:16.029
willing to set bold deadlines

00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:19.981
for the achievement of daring dreams
on the scale of Apollo again.

00:01:22.368 --> 00:01:23.861
When I think about dreams,

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:27.934
I think about the drag queens
of LA and Stonewall

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.307
and millions of other people
risking everything

00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.643
to come out when that
was really dangerous,

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:37.388
and of this picture of the White House
lit up in rainbow colors,

00:01:37.412 --> 00:01:38.570
yes --

00:01:38.594 --> 00:01:44.373
(Applause) --

00:01:44.397 --> 00:01:47.885
celebrating America's gay and lesbian
citizens' right to marry.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.156
It is a picture that in my wildest dreams
I could never have imagined

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.908
when I was 18

00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:57.932
and figuring out that I was gay

00:01:57.956 --> 00:02:01.623
and feeling estranged from my country

00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:04.043
and my dreams because of it.

00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:09.210
I think about this picture of my family

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:13.257
that I never dreamed I could ever have --

00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:19.117
(Applause) --

00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:22.067
and of our children holding this headline

00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:26.852
I never dreamed could ever be printed
about the Supreme Court ruling.

00:02:28.517 --> 00:02:34.295
We need more of the courage
of drag queens and astronauts.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.645
(Laughter)

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.342
(Applause)

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:42.708
But I want to talk
about the need for us to dream

00:02:42.732 --> 00:02:44.818
in more than one dimension,

00:02:44.842 --> 00:02:50.248
because there was something about Apollo
that I didn't know when I was 8,

00:02:50.272 --> 00:02:54.533
and something about organizing
that the rainbow colors over.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:03:00.778
Of the 30 astronauts in the original
Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs,

00:03:00.802 --> 00:03:04.310
only seven marriages survived.

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:09.474
Those iconic images of the astronauts
bouncing on the Moon

00:03:09.498 --> 00:03:13.510
obscure the alcoholism
and depression on Earth.

00:03:14.907 --> 00:03:17.517
Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk,

00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:19.956
asked during the time of Apollo,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.896
"What can we gain by sailing to the moon

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.427
if we are not able to cross the abyss
that separates us from ourselves?"

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:34.372
And what can we gain by the right to marry

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:37.539
if we are not able to cross the acrimony

00:03:37.563 --> 00:03:42.089
and emotional distance
that so often separates us from our love?

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:44.581
And not just in marriage.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.024
I have seen the most hurtful, destructive,

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:56.429
tragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS

00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.849
and breast cancer and non-profit activism,

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:01.437
all in the name of love.

00:04:02.898 --> 00:04:07.615
Thomas Merton also wrote
about wars among saints

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.668
and that "there is a pervasive form
of contemporary violence

00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:18.041
to which the idealist
most easily succumbs:

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:20.906
activism and overwork.

00:04:21.414 --> 00:04:26.191
The frenzy of our activism
neutralizes our work for peace.

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:30.533
It destroys our own
inner capacity for peace."

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:37.502
Too often our dreams become
these compartmentalized fixations

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:39.359
on some future

00:04:39.383 --> 00:04:43.502
that destroy our ability to be present
for our lives right now.

00:04:44.926 --> 00:04:48.641
Our dreams of a better life
for some future humanity

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:50.925
or some other humanity in another country

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.973
alienate us from the beautiful
human beings sitting next to us

00:04:54.997 --> 00:04:56.910
at this very moment.

00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:01.640
Well, that's just the price
of progress, we say.

00:05:01.664 --> 00:05:03.077
You can go to the Moon

00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:07.115
or you can have stability
in your family life.

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:11.988
And we can't conceive of dreaming
in both dimensions at the same time.

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:15.777
And we don't set the bar
much higher than stability

00:05:15.801 --> 00:05:18.555
when it comes to our emotional life.

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:21.915
Which is why our technology
for talking to one another

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.308
has gone vertical,

00:05:24.332 --> 00:05:28.038
our ability to listen
and understand one another

00:05:28.062 --> 00:05:29.232
has gone nowhere.

00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:34.220
Our access to information
is through the roof,

00:05:35.665 --> 00:05:39.220
our access to joy, grounded.

00:05:41.442 --> 00:05:47.314
But this idea, that our present
and our future are mutually exclusive,

00:05:47.338 --> 00:05:51.334
that to fulfill our potential for doing
we have to surrender

00:05:51.358 --> 00:05:54.521
our profound potential for being,

00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:58.456
that the number of transistors
on a circuit can be doubled and doubled,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.782
but our capacity for compassion
and humanity and serenity and love

00:06:02.806 --> 00:06:04.884
is somehow limited

00:06:04.908 --> 00:06:07.874
is a false and suffocating choice.

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:12.049
Now, I'm not suggesting

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:17.701
simply the uninspiring idea
of more work-life balance.

00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:22.454
What good is it for me to spend
more time with my kids at home

00:06:22.478 --> 00:06:25.263
if my mind is always somewhere else
while I'm doing it?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.565
I'm not even talking about mindfulness.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:32.961
Mindfulness is all of a sudden becoming
a tool for improving productivity.

00:06:33.973 --> 00:06:36.290
(Laughter)

00:06:36.314 --> 00:06:37.466
Right?

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.434
I'm talking about dreaming

00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:45.219
as boldly in the dimension of our being

00:06:45.243 --> 00:06:47.727
as we do about industry and technology.

00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:51.615
I'm talking about
an audacious authenticity

00:06:52.536 --> 00:06:55.528
that allows us to cry with one another,

00:06:56.298 --> 00:07:01.826
a heroic humility that allows us
to remove our masks and be real.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.375
It is our inability
to be with one another,

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:08.733
our fear of crying with one another,
that gives rise to so many

00:07:08.757 --> 00:07:12.051
of the problems we are frantically
trying to solve in the first place,

00:07:12.075 --> 00:07:15.375
from Congressional gridlock
to economic inhumanity.

00:07:16.097 --> 00:07:19.364
(Applause)

00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:23.435
I'm talking about what Jonas Salk
called an Epoch B,

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:29.070
a new epoch in which we become
as excited about and curious about

00:07:29.094 --> 00:07:33.103
and scientific about
the development of our humanity

00:07:33.127 --> 00:07:35.722
as we are about the development
of our technology.

00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:39.802
We should not shrink from this opportunity

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:42.595
simply because
we don't really understand it.

00:07:43.357 --> 00:07:45.972
There was a time
when we didn't understand space.

00:07:46.722 --> 00:07:50.150
Or because we're more used
to technology and activism.

00:07:50.174 --> 00:07:53.445
That is the very definition
of being stuck in a comfort zone.

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:59.103
We are now very comfortable imagining
unimaginable technological achievement.

00:07:59.842 --> 00:08:03.993
In 2016, it is the dimension
of our being itself

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:09.147
that cries out for its fair share
of our imagination.

00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:14.107
Now, we're all here to dream,

00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:15.799
but maybe if we're honest about it,

00:08:15.823 --> 00:08:18.512
each of us chasing our own dream.

00:08:18.536 --> 00:08:22.306
You know, looking at the name tags
to see who can help me with my dream,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.426
sometimes looking right through
one another's humanity.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.156
I can't be bothered with you right now.
I have an idea for saving the world.

00:08:29.513 --> 00:08:30.665
Right?

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:33.806
(Laughter)

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.306
Years ago, once upon a time,
I had this beautiful company

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.290
that created these long journeys
for heroic civic engagement.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.694
And we had this mantra:

00:08:44.718 --> 00:08:48.535
"Human. Kind. Be Both."

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:55.075
And we encouraged people to experiment
outrageously with kindness.

00:08:55.599 --> 00:08:58.360
Like, "Go help everybody
set up their tents."

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.971
And there were a lot of tents.

00:09:01.995 --> 00:09:03.265
(Laughter)

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.766
"Go buy everybody Popsicles."

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.671
"Go help people fix their flat tires

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:10.621
even though you know
the dinner line is going to get longer."

00:09:10.645 --> 00:09:13.019
And people really took us up on this,

00:09:13.043 --> 00:09:15.670
so much so that if you got
a flat tire on the AIDS ride,

00:09:15.694 --> 00:09:19.321
you had trouble fixing it, because there
were so many people there asking you

00:09:19.345 --> 00:09:20.495
if you needed help.

00:09:21.345 --> 00:09:25.354
For a few days,
for tens of thousands of people,

00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:27.292
we created these worlds

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:31.522
that everybody said were the way
they wish the world could always be.

00:09:34.316 --> 00:09:38.823
What if we experimented
with creating that kind of world

00:09:38.847 --> 00:09:40.485
these next few days?

00:09:42.156 --> 00:09:45.965
And instead of going up to someone
and asking them, "What do you do?"

00:09:47.195 --> 00:09:49.264
ask them, "So what are your dreams?"

00:09:50.315 --> 00:09:52.283
or "What are your broken dreams?"

00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:58.163
You know, "TED."
Tend to Each other's Dreams.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.599
(Applause)

00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:06.179
Maybe it's "I want to stay sober"

00:10:06.203 --> 00:10:08.869
or "I want to build
a tree house with my kid."

00:10:09.512 --> 00:10:12.704
You know, instead of going up
to the person everybody wants to meet,

00:10:12.728 --> 00:10:14.485
go up to the person who is all alone

00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:17.196
and ask them if they want
to grab a cup of coffee.

00:10:18.544 --> 00:10:21.020
I think what we fear most

00:10:21.044 --> 00:10:25.400
is that we will be denied the opportunity
to fulfill our true potential,

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:28.035
that we are born to dream

00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:31.671
and we might die
without ever having the chance.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.258
Imagine living in a world

00:10:35.282 --> 00:10:41.479
where we simply recognize
that deep, existential fear in one another

00:10:41.503 --> 00:10:44.635
and love one another boldly
because we know

00:10:44.659 --> 00:10:48.222
that to be human
is to live with that fear.

00:10:49.793 --> 00:10:55.341
It's time for us to dream
in multiple dimensions simultaneously,

00:10:56.262 --> 00:11:00.230
and somewhere that transcends
all of the wondrous things

00:11:00.254 --> 00:11:03.904
we can and will and must do

00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:10.087
lies the domain of all
the unbelievable things we could be.

00:11:11.748 --> 00:11:15.206
It's time we set foot into that dimension

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.983
and came out about the fact
that we have dreams there, too.

00:11:21.214 --> 00:11:24.079
If the Moon could dream,

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:29.952
I think that would be its dream for us.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.179
It's an honor to be with you.

00:11:33.203 --> 00:11:35.112
Thank you very much.

00:11:35.136 --> 00:11:42.136
(Applause)
