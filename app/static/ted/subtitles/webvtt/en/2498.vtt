WEBVTT

00:00:00.557 --> 00:00:04.235
In the space that used
to house one transistor,

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.098
we can now fit one billion.

00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:11.533
That made it so that a computer
the size of an entire room

00:00:11.557 --> 00:00:14.146
now fits in your pocket.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.189
You might say the future is small.

00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:18.818
As an engineer,

00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:22.827
I'm inspired by this miniaturization
revolution in computers.

00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:24.199
As a physician,

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:29.946
I wonder whether we could use it
to reduce the number of lives lost

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.077
due to one of the fastest-growing
diseases on Earth:

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.519
cancer.

00:00:35.543 --> 00:00:36.798
Now when I say that,

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:40.600
what most people hear me say
is that we're working on curing cancer.

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:41.887
And we are.

00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:43.062
But it turns out

00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:45.887
that there's an incredible
opportunity to save lives

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:49.244
through the early detection
and prevention of cancer.

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:55.164
Worldwide, over two-thirds of deaths
due to cancer are fully preventable

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.988
using methods that we already
have in hand today.

00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:01.305
Things like vaccination, timely screening

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.562
and of course, stopping smoking.

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:07.909
But even with the best tools
and technologies that we have today,

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.996
some tumors can't be detected

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.690
until 10 years after
they've started growing,

00:01:13.714 --> 00:01:17.477
when they are 50 million
cancer cells strong.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:19.857
What if we had better technologies

00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:22.987
to detect some of these more
deadly cancers sooner,

00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:24.313
when they could be removed,

00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:26.538
when they were just getting started?

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:29.837
Let me tell you about how
miniaturization might get us there.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.428
This is a microscope in a typical lab

00:01:33.452 --> 00:01:37.008
that a pathologist would use
for looking at a tissue specimen,

00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:39.470
like a biopsy or a pap smear.

00:01:39.927 --> 00:01:41.995
This $7,000 microscope

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:45.275
would be used by somebody
with years of specialized training

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.088
to spot cancer cells.

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:51.172
This is an image from a colleague
of mine at Rice University,

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.774
Rebecca Richards-Kortum.

00:01:52.798 --> 00:01:56.625
What she and her team have done
is miniaturize that whole microscope

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.624
into this $10 part,

00:01:58.648 --> 00:02:01.464
and it fits on the end
of an optical fiber.

00:02:01.923 --> 00:02:05.557
Now what that means is instead
of taking a sample from a patient

00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:07.230
and sending it to the microscope,

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:09.810
you can bring the microscope
to the patient.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.619
And then, instead of requiring
a specialist to look at the images,

00:02:14.643 --> 00:02:19.705
you can train the computer to score
normal versus cancerous cells.

00:02:20.084 --> 00:02:21.254
Now this is important,

00:02:21.278 --> 00:02:24.315
because what they found
working in rural communities,

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.578
is that even when they have
a mobile screening van

00:02:27.602 --> 00:02:30.435
that can go out into the community
and perform exams

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.864
and collect samples

00:02:31.888 --> 00:02:35.104
and send them to the central
hospital for analysis,

00:02:35.128 --> 00:02:36.472
that days later,

00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:39.163
women get a call
with an abnormal test result

00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:40.804
and they're asked to come in.

00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:45.171
Fully half of them don't turn up
because they can't afford the trip.

00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:49.145
With the integrated microscope
and computer analysis,

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.997
Rebecca and her colleagues
have been able to create a van

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:55.807
that has both a diagnostic setup
and a treatment setup.

00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:58.545
And what that means
is that they can do a diagnosis

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.256
and perform therapy on the spot,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.418
so no one is lost to follow up.

00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:07.779
That's just one example of how
miniaturization can save lives.

00:03:08.148 --> 00:03:09.301
Now as engineers,

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:12.070
we think of this
as straight-up miniaturization.

00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:14.531
You took a big thing
and you made it little.

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:16.806
But what I told you before about computers

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.076
was that they transformed our lives

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.401
when they became small enough
for us to take them everywhere.

00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:28.081
So what is the transformational
equivalent like that in medicine?

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.636
Well, what if you had a detector

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.922
that was so small that it could
circulate in your body,

00:03:35.946 --> 00:03:38.359
find the tumor all by itself

00:03:38.383 --> 00:03:40.752
and send a signal to the outside world?

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.156
It sounds a little bit
like science fiction.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.083
But actually, nanotechnology
allows us to do just that.

00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:52.296
Nanotechnology allows us to shrink
the parts that make up the detector

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.157
from the width of a human hair,

00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:55.841
which is 100 microns,

00:03:55.865 --> 00:03:58.420
to a thousand times smaller,

00:03:58.444 --> 00:04:00.346
which is 100 nanometers.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.180
And that has profound implications.

00:04:03.583 --> 00:04:07.226
It turns out that materials
actually change their properties

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.846
at the nanoscale.

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.777
You take a common material like gold,

00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.122
and you grind it into dust,
into gold nanoparticles,

00:04:15.146 --> 00:04:18.458
and it changes from looking
gold to looking red.

00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:22.895
If you take a more exotic material
like cadmium selenide --

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.093
forms a big, black crystal --

00:04:25.117 --> 00:04:27.718
if you make nanocrystals
out of this material

00:04:27.742 --> 00:04:29.315
and you put it in a liquid,

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.163
and you shine light on it,

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:32.353
they glow.

00:04:32.377 --> 00:04:38.008
And they glow blue, green,
yellow, orange, red,

00:04:38.032 --> 00:04:40.307
depending only on their size.

00:04:40.887 --> 00:04:44.890
It's wild! Can you imagine an object
like that in the macro world?

00:04:44.914 --> 00:04:51.485
It would be like all the denim jeans
in your closet are all made of cotton,

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.820
but they are different colors
depending only on their size.

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.908
(Laughter)

00:04:58.982 --> 00:05:00.506
So as a physician,

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.754
what's just as interesting to me

00:05:02.778 --> 00:05:05.078
is that it's not just
the color of materials

00:05:05.102 --> 00:05:07.033
that changes at the nanoscale;

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:10.665
the way they travel
in your body also changes.

00:05:11.137 --> 00:05:13.936
And this is the kind of observation
that we're going to use

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.134
to make a better cancer detector.

00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:17.911
So let me show you what I mean.

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:20.883
This is a blood vessel in the body.

00:05:20.907 --> 00:05:23.318
Surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.

00:05:23.683 --> 00:05:26.724
We're going to inject nanoparticles
into the blood vessel

00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:30.928
and watch how they travel
from the bloodstream into the tumor.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:35.816
Now it turns out that the blood vessels
of many tumors are leaky,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.206
and so nanoparticles can leak out
from the bloodstream into the tumor.

00:05:40.628 --> 00:05:43.762
Whether they leak out
depends on their size.

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:45.279
So in this image,

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:49.674
the smaller, hundred-nanometer,
blue nanoparticles are leaking out,

00:05:49.698 --> 00:05:53.094
and the larger, 500-nanometer,
red nanoparticles

00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:54.895
are stuck in the bloodstream.

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.022
So that means as an engineer,

00:05:57.046 --> 00:06:01.038
depending on how big
or small I make a material,

00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:04.103
I can change where it goes in your body.

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.891
In my lab, we recently made
a cancer nanodetector

00:06:09.915 --> 00:06:15.163
that is so small that it could travel
into the body and look for tumors.

00:06:15.477 --> 00:06:19.569
We designed it to listen
for tumor invasion:

00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:24.366
the orchestra of chemical signals
that tumors need to make to spread.

00:06:24.932 --> 00:06:27.834
For a tumor to break out
of the tissue that it's born in,

00:06:27.858 --> 00:06:30.574
it has to make chemicals called enzymes

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.182
to chew through
the scaffolding of tissues.

00:06:33.763 --> 00:06:38.485
We designed these nanoparticles
to be activated by these enzymes.

00:06:39.034 --> 00:06:44.946
One enzyme can activate a thousand
of these chemical reactions in an hour.

00:06:45.462 --> 00:06:49.020
Now in engineering, we call
that one-to-a-thousand ratio

00:06:49.044 --> 00:06:50.609
a form of amplification,

00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:52.805
and it makes something ultrasensitive.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:56.662
So we've made an ultrasensitive
cancer detector.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.120
OK, but how do I get this activated
signal to the outside world,

00:07:02.144 --> 00:07:03.882
where I can act on it?

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:07.458
For this, we're going to use
one more piece of nanoscale biology,

00:07:07.482 --> 00:07:09.266
and that has to do with the kidney.

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:11.575
The kidney is a filter.

00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:16.625
Its job is to filter out the blood
and put waste into the urine.

00:07:17.197 --> 00:07:19.859
It turns out that what the kidney filters

00:07:19.883 --> 00:07:22.445
is also dependent on size.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.841
So in this image, what you can see

00:07:24.865 --> 00:07:27.874
is that everything smaller
than five nanometers

00:07:27.898 --> 00:07:32.003
is going from the blood,
through the kidney, into the urine,

00:07:32.027 --> 00:07:34.697
and everything else
that's bigger is retained.

00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:40.123
OK, so if I make a 100-nanometer
cancer detector,

00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:42.619
I inject it in the bloodstream,

00:07:42.643 --> 00:07:48.073
it can leak into the tumor
where it's activated by tumor enzymes

00:07:48.097 --> 00:07:50.453
to release a small signal

00:07:50.477 --> 00:07:53.699
that is small enough to be
filtered out of the kidney

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.901
and put into the urine,

00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:59.966
I have a signal in the outside world
that I can detect.

00:08:00.588 --> 00:08:02.640
OK, but there's one more problem.

00:08:02.664 --> 00:08:04.410
This is a tiny little signal,

00:08:04.434 --> 00:08:06.406
so how do I detect it?

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.965
Well, the signal is just a molecule.

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:11.656
They're molecules
that we designed as engineers.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.858
They're completely synthetic,
and we can design them

00:08:14.882 --> 00:08:18.121
so they are compatible
with our tool of choice.

00:08:18.145 --> 00:08:21.587
If we want to use a really
sensitive, fancy instrument

00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:23.575
called a mass spectrometer,

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:26.110
then we make a molecule
with a unique mass.

00:08:26.671 --> 00:08:30.370
Or maybe we want make something
that's more inexpensive and portable.

00:08:30.394 --> 00:08:34.177
Then we make molecules
that we can trap on paper,

00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:35.905
like a pregnancy test.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.555
In fact, there's a whole
world of paper tests

00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:43.091
that are becoming available
in a field called paper diagnostics.

00:08:43.711 --> 00:08:46.037
Alright, where are we going with this?

00:08:46.724 --> 00:08:48.293
What I'm going to tell you next,

00:08:48.317 --> 00:08:50.143
as a lifelong researcher,

00:08:50.167 --> 00:08:52.046
represents a dream of mine.

00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:54.489
I can't say that's it's a promise;

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:56.005
it's a dream.

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:59.616
But I think we all have to have dreams
to keep us pushing forward,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.577
even -- and maybe especially --
cancer researchers.

00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:07.100
I'm going to tell you what I hope
will happen with my technology,

00:09:07.124 --> 00:09:11.215
that my team and I will put
our hearts and souls

00:09:11.239 --> 00:09:12.761
into making a reality.

00:09:13.289 --> 00:09:14.987
OK, here goes.

00:09:15.011 --> 00:09:18.366
I dream that one day,

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.645
instead of going into
an expensive screening facility

00:09:21.669 --> 00:09:23.174
to get a colonoscopy,

00:09:23.198 --> 00:09:24.521
or a mammogram,

00:09:24.545 --> 00:09:25.953
or a pap smear,

00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:28.304
that you could get a shot,

00:09:28.328 --> 00:09:29.988
wait an hour,

00:09:30.012 --> 00:09:32.807
and do a urine test on a paper strip.

00:09:33.653 --> 00:09:36.460
I imagine that this could even happen

00:09:36.484 --> 00:09:39.147
without the need for steady electricity,

00:09:39.171 --> 00:09:41.775
or a medical professional in the room.

00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:43.296
Maybe they could be far away

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.130
and connected only by the image
on a smartphone.

00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:48.589
Now I know this sounds like a dream,

00:09:48.613 --> 00:09:51.732
but in the lab we already
have this working in mice,

00:09:51.756 --> 00:09:53.835
where it works better
than existing methods

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:57.830
for the detection of lung,
colon and ovarian cancer.

00:09:58.603 --> 00:10:00.837
And I hope that what this means

00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:06.037
is that one day we can
detect tumors in patients

00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:09.354
sooner than 10 years
after they've started growing,

00:10:09.378 --> 00:10:11.363
in all walks of life,

00:10:11.387 --> 00:10:13.236
all around the globe,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.995
and that this would lead
to earlier treatments,

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:19.617
and that we could save more lives
than we can today,

00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:20.925
with early detection.

00:10:21.686 --> 00:10:22.868
Thank you.

00:10:22.892 --> 00:10:30.375
