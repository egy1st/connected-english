WEBVTT

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:06.904
Do I look real to you?

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.341
Hope so.

00:00:09.797 --> 00:00:11.600
I have no idea if you're seeing this,

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:15.043
but I'm just going to look ahead
and trust that you're there.

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:18.566
I've drawn a semicircle
in the sand in front of me

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.945
so I don't walk past it
and look like I'm floating in midair.

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:28.061
Right now I'm standing

00:00:29.132 --> 00:00:30.283
in the open air,

00:00:30.307 --> 00:00:32.172
on a beach under a palm tree,

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.615
in the exact spot
where your stage used to be.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.734
I have 12 minutes with you.

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:42.043
I set a limit.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.005
My wife Navid once said

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:48.030
that infinite possibility
is a creator's worst enemy.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:51.510
For example, this dress: I'd asked
her to design something

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:54.887
that a priest might have worn
in 23rd-century Cairo.

00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.943
But we only had three days to make it,

00:00:57.967 --> 00:00:59.671
and the only fabric we had

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:02.416
was an old duvet cover
that another resident left behind.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.915
But she did it, and it's perfect.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.677
And she looked at it and said,

00:01:09.664 --> 00:01:12.334
"Proof of concept --
creation needs constraint."

00:01:15.727 --> 00:01:18.168
So with these 12 minutes,

00:01:19.072 --> 00:01:21.843
I'm going to tell you
about my greatest discovery.

00:01:24.812 --> 00:01:28.256
For my whole life, my obsession
has been eternal life,

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.391
as I know it is so many of yours.

00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:36.787
You may be happy to know
that your research will pay off.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.398
I am 318 years old.

00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:45.257
The average human lifespan
is now 432 years,

00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:48.561
and my work has been to extend
the human lifespan indefinitely.

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:51.850
And I've never questioned that someday,

00:01:51.874 --> 00:01:54.816
we'll reach a point
where we'll be content.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.565
But the opposite keeps happening:

00:01:58.589 --> 00:02:01.063
the longer we live,
the longer we want to live,

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.715
the less we want to die.

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:05.310
Who can blame us?

00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:09.441
The universe is so big.

00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:12.454
There won't ever not be more to see.

00:02:12.478 --> 00:02:13.629
Just yesterday,

00:02:13.653 --> 00:02:16.413
I was reading about how you can
take out a boat on Europa

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:18.851
and sail from island to island
all over the planet,

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:22.108
and some of the islands have villages
that you can stay and visit

00:02:22.132 --> 00:02:24.921
and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter.

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:28.992
And then there's this other island
where there's just one songwriter

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:31.493
who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean.

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:33.857
And then there are others
where there's no one

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:35.862
and there never has been,

00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:39.711
and so you go just for the pleasure
of touching your foot to sand

00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:41.917
that no foot has ever touched before.

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:45.870
You could spend 400 years doing just that.

00:02:51.627 --> 00:02:54.044
Right now the Moon is rising
in the Northeast.

00:02:55.013 --> 00:02:57.164
I can see the cities on it
with my naked eye.

00:02:57.188 --> 00:02:59.300
They're connected like nerve clusters:

00:03:00.332 --> 00:03:05.825
Mariapolis on the South Pole,
and Ramachandran on the Equator.

00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:09.962
And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility.

00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:14.448
That's where Navid and I met.

00:03:14.472 --> 00:03:16.457
We were both artists downtown.

00:03:18.138 --> 00:03:20.994
The day we met, we were passing
each other in Azadi Square,

00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:22.480
and we bumped shoulders.

00:03:22.504 --> 00:03:24.255
And I turned to apologize

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:28.578
and she, without saying hello
or introducing herself or anything,

00:03:28.602 --> 00:03:32.140
said, "Well, why do you think
we didn't just pass through each other?"

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:38.339
And first of all, I thought,
"Who the hell are you?"

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:40.385
But second, the question annoyed me,

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.201
because the answer is so simple.

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:45.308
I said, "We didn't pass through each other

00:03:45.332 --> 00:03:47.576
because elementary particles have mass

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.973
and because the space
between elementary particles

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:53.369
is filled with the binding energy
that also has the properties of mass,

00:03:53.393 --> 00:03:55.573
and we've known that for 800 years."

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.875
She must have been in one of those moods

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:01.787
where she likes to mess with strangers.

00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:03.700
Or maybe she was just flirting with me,

00:04:03.724 --> 00:04:07.095
because she looked at me and said,
"I thought you'd say that.

00:04:08.636 --> 00:04:09.787
Think deeper."

00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:11.334
And then she took off her belt,

00:04:11.358 --> 00:04:14.861
this belt that I'm wearing now,

00:04:16.408 --> 00:04:17.583
and she said,

00:04:20.607 --> 00:04:24.372
"Our universe is built
so that particles have mass.

00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:28.270
Without that basic constraint,

00:04:28.294 --> 00:04:31.777
we'd have just passed right through
each other at the speed of light

00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:33.271
and never even known."

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:38.375
And that's how our romance began.

00:04:46.128 --> 00:04:47.588
Navid and I

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:51.731
never ran out of things to talk about.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.476
Never.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.252
It was incredible.

00:04:56.276 --> 00:05:00.810
It was like we were both heroes
climbing up into a mountain range together

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:03.289
and we kept arriving at new vistas,

00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:06.309
and these new, perfect
constellations of words

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:08.190
would come out of us to describe them.

00:05:08.214 --> 00:05:10.338
And we'd forget them
as soon as we made them,

00:05:10.362 --> 00:05:13.783
and throw them over our shoulder
and go on to the next thing, on and up.

00:05:13.807 --> 00:05:17.721
Or one time, Navid said that our talk
was like we were always making bread,

00:05:17.745 --> 00:05:21.264
and that we were always
adding in a little more flour

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:22.737
and a little more water,

00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:24.714
and folding it in and turning it over

00:05:24.738 --> 00:05:28.412
and never getting around to baking it.

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:36.018
If my obsession was eternal life,
Navid's obsession was touch.

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:40.788
She had a genius for it.

00:05:41.502 --> 00:05:43.439
All of her work revolved around it.

00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:47.589
My body was like a canvas for her,

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:52.234
and she would draw her fingertip
down over my face so slowly

00:05:52.258 --> 00:05:54.241
that I couldn't feel it moving.

00:05:54.265 --> 00:05:56.938
And she was obsessed with the exact moment

00:05:56.962 --> 00:06:00.840
when I would stop being able to tell
the difference between her body and mine.

00:06:03.721 --> 00:06:06.716
Or she would just lie across me
and dig her shoulder into mine

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.631
and say, "Pilar, why does
this feel so good?"

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.592
I'd say, "I don't know!"

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.626
And she always had a facetious answer
for her facetious question,

00:06:21.033 --> 00:06:23.597
but the answer I remember today is,

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:26.550
"It feels good

00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:29.354
because the universe chose
its constraints,

00:06:29.378 --> 00:06:30.663
and we are its art."

00:06:41.677 --> 00:06:44.702
It's always funny what you think
the future is going to be like

00:06:44.726 --> 00:06:46.296
versus what it turns out to be.

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.273
In your time, scientists thought
humans could freeze themselves

00:06:51.297 --> 00:06:52.629
and wake up in the future.

00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:56.471
And they did -- but then they died.

00:06:59.083 --> 00:07:02.843
In your time, scientists thought
humans could replace organs

00:07:02.867 --> 00:07:05.120
and extend life for hundreds of years.

00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:07.657
And they did,

00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:09.683
but eventually, they died anyway.

00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:14.771
In your time, Earth
is the only place people live.

00:07:17.826 --> 00:07:21.211
In my time, Earth is the place
people come to die.

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:29.059
So when Navid started to show the signs,

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.515
our friends assumed I would do
what everyone does,

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:33.674
which is say goodbye
and send her to Earth,

00:07:34.517 --> 00:07:37.732
so that none of us
would have to look at her

00:07:37.756 --> 00:07:41.492
or be around her
or think about her and her ...

00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:43.858
failure to keep living.

00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:49.995
More than anything,

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:52.796
they didn't want to be around
her actual physical body.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.824
They kept referring to it as "declining,"

00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:58.801
even though she herself
was fascinated by it,

00:07:58.825 --> 00:08:00.948
the changes it was going through,

00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:04.845
following the rules of its nature
day by day, independent of her will.

00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:10.051
I did send Navid to Earth.

00:08:11.948 --> 00:08:13.355
But I came with her.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.509
I remember a friend of ours,
just before we left, said,

00:08:18.192 --> 00:08:19.739
"I just think it's arrogant,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.953
like the rules don't apply to you,
like you think your love is that special."

00:08:27.497 --> 00:08:28.720
But I did.

00:08:32.468 --> 00:08:33.858
So, even here on Earth,

00:08:33.882 --> 00:08:36.579
I kept working on how to extend life.

00:08:37.198 --> 00:08:38.349
It didn't occur to me

00:08:38.373 --> 00:08:40.416
that there could be any other response.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.979
I kept going back to that thing
that Navid said to me

00:08:43.003 --> 00:08:44.742
that day in Azadi Square,

00:08:44.766 --> 00:08:46.707
that without that basic constraint --

00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:49.762
a universe that granted mass to matter --

00:08:49.786 --> 00:08:51.183
we would not exist.

00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:54.652
That's one rule.

00:08:54.676 --> 00:08:58.564
Another rule is that all mass
is subject to entropy.

00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:02.700
And there is no way to be
in this universe without mass.

00:09:02.724 --> 00:09:04.406
I know. I tried everything.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.569
I tried creating a photon box
where the Higgs field was altered.

00:09:09.043 --> 00:09:13.175
I tried recording all
subatomic movements in my body

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:14.986
and replaying them on closed loop.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.191
Nothing worked.

00:09:21.184 --> 00:09:26.944
But my final innovation
was to create a coil dimension

00:09:26.968 --> 00:09:31.299
with the boundaries of a body
in which time moved infinitely slower,

00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:35.718
but whose projection would appear
to move in normal time.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.059
That body would then appear
in our universe as a hologram --

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:44.604
here but not here.

00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:50.521
When I realized I'd done it,

00:09:51.987 --> 00:09:53.843
I ran to her room,

00:09:53.867 --> 00:09:56.061
so happy to tell her I'd done it,

00:09:56.838 --> 00:09:59.696
moving through space
almost normally to all eyes,

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:01.704
even to my own,

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.585
and went to lie down next to her,

00:10:07.262 --> 00:10:09.594
and forgot, and fell right through her.

00:10:16.303 --> 00:10:18.488
I'd found a way to eternal life,

00:10:20.448 --> 00:10:22.758
at the expense of the one thing
Navid loved most,

00:10:22.782 --> 00:10:26.128
which was to touch and be touched.

00:10:29.939 --> 00:10:31.286
And she threw me out.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.412
I still got to watch, though.

00:10:39.748 --> 00:10:41.480
Humans live 400 years now,

00:10:41.504 --> 00:10:42.882
and we still die.

00:10:42.906 --> 00:10:45.114
And when death comes,

00:10:46.342 --> 00:10:49.597
the dying still pick at their bedsheets,

00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:56.130
and their arms break out
in blue and violet blooms on the insides,

00:10:56.154 --> 00:10:59.668
and their breaths get further
and further apart,

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:02.341
like they're falling asleep.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.034
I've always thought that

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.890
what gives a life meaning is adventure.

00:11:15.476 --> 00:11:17.869
And death is just a problem

00:11:17.893 --> 00:11:20.361
we haven't discovered the solution to yet.

00:11:24.594 --> 00:11:27.297
But maybe a life has meaning
only because it ends.

00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:29.544
Maybe that's the paradox:

00:11:29.568 --> 00:11:33.419
constraints don't constrain,
they allow perfect freedom.

00:11:39.175 --> 00:11:40.435
(Sighs)

00:11:45.963 --> 00:11:47.987
There was a thunderstorm
here this morning.

00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:49.844
There is another forecast for tonight,

00:11:49.868 --> 00:11:51.637
but for now the sky is clear.

00:11:52.937 --> 00:11:54.290
I can't feel the wind here,

00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:57.678
but I just asked one of the caretakers
who passed by what it felt like,

00:11:57.702 --> 00:12:00.845
and she said it felt warm,
like melted butter.
