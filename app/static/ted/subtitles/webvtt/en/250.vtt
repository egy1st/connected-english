00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I got a B+. (Laughter)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I'm gonna try and do that within

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and to follow the TED commandments:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that is, actually, something that creates

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a near-death experience,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but near-death is good for creativity.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
(Laughter) OK.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So, I also want to explain,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily;

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and the one that's in between that is the censor

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And I'm going do that also by looking at

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
what I think is part of my creative process,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which includes a number of things that happened, actually --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the nothing started even earlier than the moment

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
in which I'm creating something new.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And that includes nature, and nurture,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and what I refer to as nightmares.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we are innately equipped with something, perhaps

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
in our brains, some abnormal chromosome

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that causes this muse-like effect.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And others, like my mother,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
would say that I get my material from past lives.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Some people would also say that creativity

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
may be a function of some other neurological quirk --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that he might have had temporal lobe seizures,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And I will mention that I actually developed

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
but it was during the time I was writing my last book,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and some people say that book is quite different.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis:

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
you know, who am I, why am I this particular person,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
why am I not black like everybody else?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And sometimes you're equipped with skills,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And I had a miniature poodle.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
my living out of the artful arrangement of words.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
That figure right there, by the way,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
this was supposed to be my side occupation,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and it led to a sense of failure.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But actually, there was something quite real in my life

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that happened when I was about 14.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
six months later, had brain tumors.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and that God's will would take care of that.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
-- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
why this would have happened.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
There was a reason for everything.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And so, I had this notion of death all around me,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
you begin to think very much about everything.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You become very creative, in a survival sense.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And this, then, led to my big questions.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And they're the same ones that I have today.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
in what order they happen. What are the influences?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
as the creator of that universe.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And you see, there's a lot of back and forth

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
-- years and years, oftentimes.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
throughout this conference,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
almost everything that's been going on.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association:

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
but I'm still gonna use it as the process

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
for explaining how it is the metaphor.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
But when you make those associations,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
as I understand it. (Laughter)

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And this happens constantly in the writing.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
in which you're looking for something, and

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
you know, things are happening simultaneously,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and you're looking at it in a different way,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and you're trying to really look for the about-ness,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
or what is this story about. And if you try too hard,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
then you will only write the about.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
You won't discover anything.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And what you were supposed to find,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
is no longer there.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Now, I don't want to ignore

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the other side of what happens in our universe,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
like many of our scientists have.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and just say that creative people are multidimensional,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
(Laughter) And they all operate at the same time.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
There is also a big question of ambiguity.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
in my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
It is constantly there. And, just as an example,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
this is one that recently came to me.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
"Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
A very famous Chinese saying, she said.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
until things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So, there was another one that I came across,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and it's "saving fish from drowning."

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
because they're not supposed to kill anything.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and unfortunately, in the process the fish die.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
-- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me:

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
"save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
or you're going to get stuck.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
OK. I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And then we have intentions.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and then we do something.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Maybe things go wrong. And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
What are we supposed to do?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Do we stay in for life,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
That is the ambiguity in my life

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
"Saving Fish From Drowning."

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I got these hints everywhere.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And what I need, in effect, is a focus.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And when I have the question, it is a focus.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And it seems like it's happening all the time.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
in which you're getting all this help from the universe.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And you are noticing it more often.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But you apply this.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Why or why not?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It may be something that is perhaps more serious

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
-- as I said, human rights in Burma.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
that I approved of the military regime there.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And then, after a while, I had to ask myself,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
"Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
that other people have given us?"

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
who was a Baptist minister.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and still didn't know that if I went there,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and we talked about today, is genocide.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
This leads to this question.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and I consider what my intentions should be,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
-- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and what is my place in the universe?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and yet it is also absolutely necessary.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and that actually was the way it happened.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
There are also things, quite uncanny,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
In this case, I was writing a story

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And I needed to find something historically that would match that.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And I took down this book, and I --

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and a character who thought he was the son of God.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
You wonder, are these things random chance?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Well, what is random? What is chance? What is luck?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And that goes into the story, too.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Especially when good things happen,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and, in particular, when bad things happen.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
But I do think there's a kind of serendipity,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and I do want to know what those elements are,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
-- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and we ended up in this non-tourist location,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
a beautiful village, pristine.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And we walked three valleys beyond,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
that I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
walking along the beach, I came across this.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And it was a man, a Chinese man,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and I cannot explain it.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
in writing about these things?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
A big thing that I also think about is accidents.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
What is the nature of accidents?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
outside of a court of law?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I was able to see that in a firsthand way,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
if I wanted to write anything about China.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
there was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Responsibility was assigned to the family.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
It's the son, not the father."

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And I began to sense something different about the history,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:34.000
with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000
a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
-- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and seeing the amazing things that happened,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
determining how things happen.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
-- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
and that is where I'm gonna find the answers

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
And how do I create my own life?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And I think it is by questioning,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
I believe in specifics, the specifics of story,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
and the past, the specifics of that past,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
and what is happening in the story at that point.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
I also believe that in thinking about things --

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces --

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000
And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined --

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.000
And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And they have to be in all possibilities,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
including those I never considered before.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
So, there are never complete answers.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
myself that there is uncertainty in everything,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
and that is good, because then I will discover something new.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
it is to simply imagine.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
And to imagine is to put myself in that story,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
-- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Because for everything,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
We've come to the end of the talk,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
and it is the things that transform in our lives,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:19.000
that are wonderful and stay with us.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
There she is.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Thank you very much!

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
(Applause)
