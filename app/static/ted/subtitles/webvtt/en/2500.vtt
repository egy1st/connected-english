WEBVTT

00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:02.881
Today, I am going to show you

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:07.334
how this tablet and this virtual-reality
headset that I'm wearing

00:00:07.358 --> 00:00:11.399
are going to completely
revolutionize science education.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.895
And I'm also going to show you

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.703
how it can make any science teacher
more than twice as effective.

00:00:19.124 --> 00:00:22.588
But before I show you
how all of this is possible,

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:28.151
let's talk briefly about why improving
the quality of science education

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:30.615
is so vitally important.

00:00:31.513 --> 00:00:32.674
If you think about it,

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.973
the world is growing incredibly fast.

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:39.207
And with that growth comes
a whole list of growing challenges,

00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:42.244
challenges such as dealing
with global warming,

00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:44.631
solving starvation and water shortages

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:46.107
and curing diseases,

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:47.656
to name just a few.

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:53.882
And who, exactly, is going to help us
solve all of these great challenges?

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:58.170
Well, to a very last degree,
it is these young students.

00:00:58.194 --> 00:01:02.036
This is the next generation
of young, bright scientists.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.080
And in many ways, we all rely on them

00:01:05.104 --> 00:01:07.906
for coming up with new, great innovations

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.641
to help us solve all
these challenges ahead of us.

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:14.659
And so a couple of years back,

00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:19.042
my cofounder and I were teaching
university students just like these,

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:24.180
only the students we were teaching
looked a little bit more like this here.

00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:25.268
(Laughter)

00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:28.130
And yes, this is really
the reality out there

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:31.679
in way too many universities
around the world:

00:01:31.703 --> 00:01:34.356
students that are bored, disengaged

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.985
and sometimes not even sure
why they're learning about a topic

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.208
in the first place.

00:01:39.763 --> 00:01:44.097
So we started looking around for new,
innovative teaching methods,

00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.944
but what we found was quite disappointing.

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:50.633
We saw that books were being
turned into e-books,

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:54.511
blackboards were being turned
into YouTube videos

00:01:54.535 --> 00:01:57.679
and lecture hall monologues
were being turned into MOOCs --

00:01:57.703 --> 00:02:00.004
massive online open courses.

00:02:00.694 --> 00:02:01.941
And if you think about it,

00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:05.548
all we're really doing here
is taking the same content

00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:07.120
and the same format,

00:02:07.144 --> 00:02:10.070
and bringing it out to more students --

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:13.403
which is great, don't get me
wrong, that is really great --

00:02:13.427 --> 00:02:17.054
but the teaching method
is still more or less the same,

00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:19.374
no real innovation there.

00:02:19.863 --> 00:02:21.882
So we started looking elsewhere.

00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:26.533
What we found was that flight simulators
had been proven over and over again

00:02:26.557 --> 00:02:28.024
to be far more effective

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:33.314
when used in combination with real,
in-flight training to train the pilots.

00:02:33.338 --> 00:02:34.963
And so we thought to ourselves:

00:02:35.532 --> 00:02:37.869
Why not just apply that to science?

00:02:37.893 --> 00:02:42.444
Why not build a virtual
laboratory simulator?

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:44.811
Well, we did it.

00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:46.653
We basically set out to create

00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:52.292
a fully simulated, one-to-one,
virtual reality laboratory simulator,

00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:54.513
where the students
could perform experiments

00:02:54.537 --> 00:02:56.447
with mathematical equations

00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:59.690
that would simulate what would
happen in a real-world lab.

00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:01.393
But not just simple simulations --

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:03.483
we would also create advanced simulations

00:03:03.507 --> 00:03:05.431
with top universities like MIT,

00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:09.824
to bring out cutting-edge cancer
research to these students.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.403
And suddenly, the universities
could save millions of dollars

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:16.357
by letting the students
perform virtual experiments

00:03:16.381 --> 00:03:19.493
before they go into the real laboratory.

00:03:20.303 --> 00:03:22.835
And not only that; now,
they could also understand --

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.292
even on a molecular level
inside the machine --

00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:27.992
what is happening to the machines.

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:29.915
And then they could suddenly perform

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.567
dangerous experiments in the labs as well.

00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.077
For instance also here,

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:37.713
learning about salmonella bacteria,
which is an important topic

00:03:37.737 --> 00:03:41.708
that many schools cannot teach
for good safety reasons.

00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:44.052
And we, of course, quiz the students

00:03:44.076 --> 00:03:46.481
and then give the teachers
a full dashboard,

00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:49.431
so they fully understand
where the students are at.

00:03:50.134 --> 00:03:51.342
But we didn't stop there,

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.691
because we had seen just
how important meaning is

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:56.001
for the students' engagement in the class.

00:03:56.025 --> 00:03:57.747
So we brought in game designers

00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:00.652
to create fun and engaging stories.

00:04:00.676 --> 00:04:02.510
For instance, here in this case,

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:06.657
where the students have to solve
a mysterious CSI murder case

00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:09.375
using their core science skills.

00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:14.305
And the feedback we got
when we launched all of this

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.281
was quite overwhelmingly positive.

00:04:16.305 --> 00:04:18.108
Here we have 300 students,

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:20.847
all passionately solving CSI murder cases

00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:22.736
while learning core science skills.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.005
And what I love the most about this

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:28.673
is really when the students
come up to me sometimes afterwards,

00:04:28.697 --> 00:04:30.812
all surprised and a little confused,

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:35.539
and say, "I just spent two hours
in this virtual lab,

00:04:36.432 --> 00:04:38.611
and ... and I didn't check Facebook."

00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:39.964
(Laughter)

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:44.639
That's how engaging and immersive
this really is for the students.

00:04:44.663 --> 00:04:47.483
And so, to investigate
whether this really worked,

00:04:47.507 --> 00:04:51.910
a learning psychologist
did a study with 160 students --

00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:56.180
that was from Stanford University
and Technical University of Denmark.

00:04:56.204 --> 00:04:59.736
And what they did is split
the students into two groups.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.011
One group would only use
the virtual laboratory simulations,

00:05:04.035 --> 00:05:07.735
the other group would only use
traditional teaching methods,

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.674
and they had the same amount of time.

00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:11.953
Then, interestingly,

00:05:11.977 --> 00:05:15.644
they gave the students a test
before and after the experiment,

00:05:15.668 --> 00:05:20.021
so they could clearly measure
the learning impact of the students.

00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:21.213
And what they found

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:27.038
was a surprisingly high 76 percent
increase in the learning effectiveness

00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:31.906
when using virtual laboratories
over traditional teaching methods.

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:33.834
But even more interestingly,

00:05:33.858 --> 00:05:37.072
the second part of this study investigated

00:05:37.096 --> 00:05:40.000
what the teacher's impact
was on the learning.

00:05:40.024 --> 00:05:41.175
And what they found

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.861
was that when you combined
the virtual laboratories

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.489
with teacher-led coaching and mentoring,

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:52.329
then we saw a total 101 percent
increase in the learning effectiveness,

00:05:52.353 --> 00:05:56.785
which effectively doubles
the science teacher's impact

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:59.167
with the same amount of time spent.

00:06:01.784 --> 00:06:04.494
So a couple of months back,

00:06:04.518 --> 00:06:06.031
we started asking ourselves --

00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:08.602
we have a wonderful team now
of learning psychologists

00:06:08.626 --> 00:06:10.982
and teachers and scientists
and game developers --

00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:12.547
and we started asking ourselves:

00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:15.166
How can we keep ourselves to our promise

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.154
of constantly reimagining education?

00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:23.279
And today, I am really excited
to be presenting what we came up with

00:06:23.303 --> 00:06:26.207
and have been working
incredibly hard to create.

00:06:28.228 --> 00:06:30.861
I will explain briefly what this is.

00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:33.621
Basically, I take my mobile phone --

00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:36.351
most students already
have these, smartphones --

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:40.899
and I plug it into this virtual-reality
headset, a low-cost headset.

00:06:40.923 --> 00:06:42.892
And now what I can effectively do is,

00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:46.066
I can literally step
into this virtual world.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.174
We'll have some of you
in the audience also get to try this,

00:06:49.198 --> 00:06:52.354
because it is really something
that you have to try

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:54.673
to fully feel how immersive it really is.

00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:58.474
It literally feels like I just stepped
inside this virtual lab.

00:06:58.498 --> 00:07:00.001
Do you see me up on the screen?

00:07:00.025 --> 00:07:01.176
Audience: Yes.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.803
Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.

00:07:02.827 --> 00:07:05.725
So basically, I have just
turned my mobile phone

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:09.413
into a fully simulated, million-dollar
Ivy League laboratory

00:07:09.437 --> 00:07:12.262
with all this amazing equipment
that I can interact with.

00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:15.659
I can, for instance, pick up the pipette
and do experiments with it.

00:07:15.683 --> 00:07:18.103
I have my E-Ggel, my PCR
and -- oh, look there,

00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:20.648
I have my next-generation
sequencing machine,

00:07:20.672 --> 00:07:24.170
and there I even have
my electron microscope.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:27.624
I mean, who's carrying around
an electron microscope in their pocket?

00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:29.520
And here I have my machine,

00:07:29.544 --> 00:07:31.714
I can do different experiments
on the machine.

00:07:31.738 --> 00:07:33.192
And over here I have the door,

00:07:33.216 --> 00:07:35.584
I can go into other experiments,

00:07:35.608 --> 00:07:37.541
I can perform in the laboratories.

00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:39.771
And here, I have my learning tablet.

00:07:39.795 --> 00:07:41.249
This is an intelligent tablet

00:07:41.273 --> 00:07:44.121
that allows me to read
about relevant theory.

00:07:44.145 --> 00:07:46.447
As you can see, I can interact with it.

00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:50.365
I can watch videos and see
content that is relevant

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:53.254
to the experiment
that I'm performing right now.

00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:55.477
Then over here, I have Marie.

00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:59.020
She is my teacher --
my lab assistant --

00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:02.221
and what she does is guides me
through this whole laboratory.

00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:03.404
And very soon,

00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:06.396
the teachers will be able
to literally teleport themselves

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.979
into this virtual world
that I'm in right now

00:08:09.003 --> 00:08:12.233
and help me, guide me,
through this whole experiment.

00:08:12.257 --> 00:08:14.567
And now before I finalize this,

00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:17.559
I want to show you
an even cooler thing, I think --

00:08:17.583 --> 00:08:20.619
something you cannot
even do in real laboratories.

00:08:20.643 --> 00:08:21.881
This is a PCR machine.

00:08:21.905 --> 00:08:24.385
I'm now going to start this experiment.

00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:28.642
And what I just did is literally
shrunk myself a million times

00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:30.225
into the size of a molecule --

00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:32.598
and it really feels like it,
you have to try this.

00:08:32.622 --> 00:08:35.225
So now it feels like
I'm standing inside the machine

00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:37.842
and I'm seeing all the DNA,
and I see the molecules.

00:08:37.866 --> 00:08:41.469
I see the polymerase
and the enzymes and so forth.

00:08:41.493 --> 00:08:43.096
And I can see how in this case,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.197
DNA is being replicated millions of times,

00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:49.054
just like it's happening
inside your body right now.

00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:53.205
And I can really feel and understand
how all of this works.

00:08:54.219 --> 00:08:57.513
Now, I hope that gives you
a little bit of a sense

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:01.663
of the possibilities
in these new teaching methods.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.572
And I want to also emphasize

00:09:05.596 --> 00:09:09.287
that everything you just saw
also works on iPads and laptops

00:09:09.311 --> 00:09:10.482
without the headsets.

00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:12.870
I say that for a very important reason.

00:09:13.394 --> 00:09:16.879
In order for us to really
empower and inspire

00:09:16.903 --> 00:09:19.071
the next generation of scientists,

00:09:19.095 --> 00:09:22.619
we really need teachers
to drive the adoption

00:09:22.643 --> 00:09:25.218
of new technologies in the classroom.

00:09:26.542 --> 00:09:28.420
And so in many ways,

00:09:28.444 --> 00:09:32.799
I believe that the next big,
quantum leap in science education

00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:35.132
lies no longer with the technology,

00:09:35.156 --> 00:09:37.037
but rather with the teachers' decision

00:09:37.061 --> 00:09:40.266
to push forward and adopt
these technologies

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.037
inside the classrooms.

00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:45.898
And so it is our hope that more
universities and schools and teachers

00:09:45.922 --> 00:09:48.787
will collaborate with technology companies

00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:51.335
to realize this full potential.

00:09:52.989 --> 00:09:54.434
And so,

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:57.291
lastly, I'd like to leave you
with a little story

00:09:57.315 --> 00:09:58.877
that really inspires me.

00:09:58.901 --> 00:10:01.322
And that is the story of Jack Andraka.

00:10:01.346 --> 00:10:03.108
Some of you might already know him.

00:10:03.132 --> 00:10:10.124
Jack invented a new, groundbreaking
low-cost test for pancreatic cancer

00:10:10.148 --> 00:10:12.569
at the age 15.

00:10:13.758 --> 00:10:17.497
And when Jack shares his story
of how he did this huge breakthrough,

00:10:17.521 --> 00:10:21.346
he also explains that one thing
almost prevented him

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.163
from making this breakthrough.

00:10:23.543 --> 00:10:28.603
And that was that he did not
have access to real laboratories,

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:31.156
because he was too inexperienced

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.621
to be allowed in.

00:10:33.853 --> 00:10:36.055
Now, imagine if we could bring

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:39.348
Ivy League, million-dollar
virtual laboratories

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:41.443
out to all these students just like Jack,

00:10:41.467 --> 00:10:43.074
all over the world,

00:10:43.098 --> 00:10:46.654
and give them the latest, greatest,
most fancy machines you can imagine

00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:49.224
that would quite literally
make any scientist in here

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:51.721
jump up and down out of pure excitement.

00:10:51.745 --> 00:10:56.355
And then imagine how that
would empower and inspire

00:10:56.379 --> 00:11:00.558
a whole new generation
of young and bright scientists,

00:11:00.582 --> 00:11:03.785
ready to innovate and change the world.

00:11:04.187 --> 00:11:05.338
Thank you very much.

00:11:05.362 --> 00:11:13.425
(Applause)
