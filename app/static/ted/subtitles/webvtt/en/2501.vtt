00:00:01.112 --> 00:00:02.437
Hi.

00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:04.807
Let me ask the audience a question:

00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:07.026
Did you ever lie as a child?

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.717
If you did, could you please
raise your hand?

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:14.599
Wow! This is the most honest
group of people I've ever met.

00:00:14.623 --> 00:00:16.580
(Laughter)

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:18.313
So for the last 20 years,

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:21.752
I've been studying
how children learn to tell lies.

00:00:21.776 --> 00:00:24.080
And today, I'm going to share with you

00:00:24.104 --> 00:00:26.266
some of the discoveries we have made.

00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:31.549
But to begin, I'm going to tell you
a story from Mr. Richard Messina,

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.702
who is my friend and an elementary
school principal.

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.827
He got a phone call one day.

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:40.430
The caller says,

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:44.336
"Mr. Messina, my son Johnny
will not come to school today

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.823
because he's sick."

00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:48.234
Mr. Messina asks,

00:00:48.258 --> 00:00:50.272
"Who am I speaking to, please?"

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:52.278
And the caller says,

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.967
"I am my father."

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:56.778
(Laughter)

00:00:58.227 --> 00:00:59.909
So this story --

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.465
(Laughter)

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.799
sums up very nicely
three common beliefs we have

00:01:05.823 --> 00:01:07.682
about children and lying.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.771
One, children only come to tell lies

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:15.063
after entering elementary school.

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:17.863
Two, children are poor liars.

00:01:17.887 --> 00:01:20.744
We adults can easily detect their lies.

00:01:20.768 --> 00:01:24.806
And three, if children lie
at a very young age,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.679
there must be some
character flaws with them,

00:01:27.703 --> 00:01:31.752
and they are going to become
pathological liars for life.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.914
Well, it turns out

00:01:34.938 --> 00:01:37.236
all of the three beliefs are wrong.

00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:41.327
We have been playing guessing games

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.433
with children all over the world.

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:44.943
Here is an example.

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:49.332
So in this game, we asked children
to guess the numbers on the cards.

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.836
And we tell them if they win the game,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.017
they are going to get a big prize.

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:57.002
But in the middle of the game,

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:59.786
we make an excuse and leave the room.

00:02:01.763 --> 00:02:03.697
And before we leave the room,

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.657
we tell them not to peek at the cards.

00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:08.934
Of course,

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.119
we have hidden cameras in the room

00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:12.938
to watch their every move.

00:02:14.216 --> 00:02:17.633
Because the desire
to win the game is so strong,

00:02:17.657 --> 00:02:21.143
more than 90 percent of children will peek

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:22.604
as soon as we leave the room.

00:02:22.628 --> 00:02:24.628
(Laughter)

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:27.030
The crucial question is:

00:02:27.054 --> 00:02:29.802
When we return and ask the children

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:32.135
whether or not they have peeked,

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.211
will the children who peeked confess

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:37.813
or lie about their transgression?

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:44.298
We found that regardless
of gender, country, religion,

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:46.513
at two years of age,

00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:49.115
30 percent lie,

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.948
70 percent tell the truth
about their transgression.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.110
At three years of age,

00:02:55.134 --> 00:02:58.608
50 percent lie and 50 percent
tell the truth.

00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:01.201
At four years of age,

00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:03.172
more than 80 percent lie.

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:06.785
And after four years of age,

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.198
most children lie.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.543
So as you can see,

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:14.030
lying is really a typical part
of development.

00:03:14.054 --> 00:03:16.844
And some children begin to tell lies

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:19.307
as young as two years of age.

00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:23.995
So now, let's take a closer look
at the younger children.

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:29.149
Why do some but not all
young children lie?

00:03:30.184 --> 00:03:33.513
In cooking, you need good ingredients

00:03:33.537 --> 00:03:35.150
to cook good food.

00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:40.356
And good lying requires
two key ingredients.

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.219
The first key ingredient
is theory of mind,

00:03:45.243 --> 00:03:47.078
or the mind-reading ability.

00:03:47.768 --> 00:03:49.846
Mind reading is the ability to know

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.478
that different people have
different knowledge about the situation

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:58.303
and the ability to differentiate
between what I know

00:03:58.327 --> 00:03:59.550
and what you know.

00:03:59.914 --> 00:04:02.161
Mind reading is important for lying

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:06.032
because the basis of lying is that I know

00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:07.207
you don't know

00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:08.382
what I know.

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:09.777
Therefore, I can lie to you.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.680
The second key ingredient
for good lying is self-control.

00:04:15.704 --> 00:04:20.327
It is the ability to control your speech,
your facial expression

00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.891
and your body language,

00:04:21.915 --> 00:04:23.993
so that you can tell a convincing lie.

00:04:24.938 --> 00:04:28.664
And we found that those young children

00:04:28.688 --> 00:04:33.544
who have more advanced mind-reading
and self-control abilities

00:04:33.568 --> 00:04:35.606
tell lies earlier

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.446
and are more sophisticated liars.

00:04:39.887 --> 00:04:45.506
As it turns out, these two abilities
are also essential for all of us

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.052
to function well in our society.

00:04:48.848 --> 00:04:53.183
In fact, deficits in mind-reading
and self-control abilities

00:04:53.207 --> 00:04:56.766
are associated with serious
developmental problems,

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.549
such as ADHD and autism.

00:05:01.893 --> 00:05:07.070
So if you discover your two-year-old
is telling his or her first lie,

00:05:07.094 --> 00:05:09.078
instead of being alarmed,

00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:10.594
you should celebrate --

00:05:10.618 --> 00:05:12.140
(Laughter)

00:05:12.164 --> 00:05:17.894
because it signals that your child
has arrived at a new milestone

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:19.553
of typical development.

00:05:21.085 --> 00:05:24.221
Now, are children poor liars?

00:05:24.878 --> 00:05:27.872
Do you think you can easily
detect their lies?

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.423
Would you like to give it a try?

00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:32.401
Yes? OK.

00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:34.564
So I'm going to show you two videos.

00:05:35.024 --> 00:05:36.175
In the videos,

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.256
the children are going to respond
to a researcher's question,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.762
"Did you peek?"

00:05:40.786 --> 00:05:42.340
So try to tell me

00:05:42.364 --> 00:05:43.762
which child is lying

00:05:43.786 --> 00:05:45.896
and which child is telling the truth.

00:05:46.272 --> 00:05:47.991
Here's child number one.

00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:50.228
Are you ready?

00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:52.926
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:55.855
Kang Lee: And this is child number two.

00:05:57.501 --> 00:05:59.693
(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.

00:06:01.296 --> 00:06:04.883
KL: OK, if you think
child number one is lying,

00:06:04.907 --> 00:06:06.594
please raise your hand.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.953
And if you think child number two
is lying, please raise your hand.

00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:16.067
OK, so as a matter of fact,

00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:19.028
child number one is telling the truth,

00:06:19.052 --> 00:06:21.081
child number two is lying.

00:06:22.124 --> 00:06:25.354
Looks like many of you are terrible
detectors of children's lies.

00:06:25.378 --> 00:06:27.856
(Laughter)

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.264
Now, we have played similar kinds of games

00:06:31.288 --> 00:06:35.913
with many, many adults
from all walks of life.

00:06:36.714 --> 00:06:38.872
And we show them many videos.

00:06:39.347 --> 00:06:41.896
In half of the videos, the children lied.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.187
In the other half of the videos,
the children told the truth.

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:49.386
And let's find out
how these adults performed.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.174
Because there are as many liars
as truth tellers,

00:06:54.198 --> 00:06:56.597
if you guess randomly,

00:06:56.621 --> 00:07:00.691
there's a 50 percent chance
you're going to get it right.

00:07:00.715 --> 00:07:04.309
So if your accuracy is around 50 percent,

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:07.774
it means you are a terrible detector
of children's lies.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.819
So let's start with undergrads
and law school students,

00:07:12.843 --> 00:07:16.515
who typically have
limited experience with children.

00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:20.000
No, they cannot detect children's lies.

00:07:20.024 --> 00:07:22.238
Their performance is around chance.

00:07:22.262 --> 00:07:27.491
Now how about social workers
and child-protection lawyers,

00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:30.189
who work with children on a daily basis?

00:07:30.213 --> 00:07:32.300
Can they detect children's lies?

00:07:33.624 --> 00:07:34.775
No, they cannot.

00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:35.844
(Laughter)

00:07:35.868 --> 00:07:37.340
What about judges,

00:07:37.364 --> 00:07:39.164
customs officers

00:07:39.188 --> 00:07:41.046
and police officers,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.713
who deal with liars on a daily basis?

00:07:43.737 --> 00:07:45.654
Can they detect children's lies?

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.014
No, they cannot.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.616
What about parents?

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.654
Can parents detect other children's lies?

00:07:53.898 --> 00:07:55.136
No, they cannot.

00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:59.406
What about, can parents
detect their own children's lies?

00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:02.409
No, they cannot.

00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:05.909
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:07.480
So now you may ask

00:08:08.504 --> 00:08:12.136
why children's lies
are so difficult to detect.

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.970
Let me illustrate this
with my own son, Nathan.

00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:18.163
This is his facial expression

00:08:18.187 --> 00:08:19.571
when he lies.

00:08:19.595 --> 00:08:21.801
(Laughter)

00:08:21.825 --> 00:08:23.427
So when children lie,

00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:26.607
their facial expression
is typically neutral.

00:08:27.123 --> 00:08:30.583
However, behind this neutral expression,

00:08:30.607 --> 00:08:33.933
the child is actually experiencing
a lot of emotions,

00:08:33.957 --> 00:08:37.812
such as fear, guilt, shame

00:08:37.836 --> 00:08:40.932
and maybe a little bit of liar's delight.

00:08:40.956 --> 00:08:43.658
(Laughter)

00:08:43.682 --> 00:08:48.522
Unfortunately, such emotions
are either fleeting or hidden.

00:08:48.546 --> 00:08:51.645
Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us.

00:08:51.669 --> 00:08:53.028
So in the last five years,

00:08:53.052 --> 00:08:56.948
we have been trying to figure out a way
to reveal these hidden emotions.

00:08:56.972 --> 00:08:58.486
Then we made a discovery.

00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:02.458
We know that underneath our facial skin,

00:09:02.482 --> 00:09:05.876
there's a rich network of blood vessels.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.317
When we experience different emotions,

00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:10.982
our facial blood flow changes subtly.

00:09:11.613 --> 00:09:15.561
And these changes are regulated
by the autonomic system

00:09:15.585 --> 00:09:17.754
that is beyond our conscious control.

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:21.982
By looking at facial blood flow changes,

00:09:22.006 --> 00:09:24.703
we can reveal people's hidden emotions.

00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:30.007
Unfortunately, such emotion-related
facial blood flow changes

00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:32.656
are too subtle to detect by our naked eye.

00:09:33.632 --> 00:09:37.400
So to help us reveal
people's facial emotions,

00:09:37.424 --> 00:09:40.458
we have developed a new imaging technology

00:09:40.482 --> 00:09:43.631
we call "transdermal optical imaging."

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:48.632
To do so, we use a regular
video camera to record people

00:09:48.656 --> 00:09:51.742
when they experience
various hidden emotions.

00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:56.479
And then, using our image
processing technology,

00:09:56.503 --> 00:10:02.039
we can extract transdermal images
of facial blood flow changes.

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:08.747
By looking at transdermal video images,

00:10:08.771 --> 00:10:10.558
now we can easily see

00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:17.368
facial blood flow changes associated
with the various hidden emotions.

00:10:17.944 --> 00:10:19.732
And using this technology,

00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:24.424
we can now reveal the hidden emotions
associated with lying,

00:10:24.448 --> 00:10:27.358
and therefore detect people's lies.

00:10:27.382 --> 00:10:29.821
We can do so noninvasively,

00:10:29.845 --> 00:10:32.384
remotely, inexpensively,

00:10:32.408 --> 00:10:36.068
with an accuracy at about 85 percent,

00:10:36.092 --> 00:10:38.146
which is far better than chance level.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.890
And in addition, we discovered
a Pinocchio effect.

00:10:44.336 --> 00:10:46.391
No, not this Pinocchio effect.

00:10:46.415 --> 00:10:47.422
(Laughter)

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:49.568
This is the real Pinocchio effect.

00:10:49.592 --> 00:10:51.009
When people lie,

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:54.812
the facial blood flow
on the cheeks decreases,

00:10:54.836 --> 00:10:58.097
and the facial blood flow
on the nose increases.

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:02.886
Of course, lying is not the only situation

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.758
that will evoke our hidden emotions.

00:11:05.782 --> 00:11:07.656
So then we asked ourselves,

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.027
in addition to detecting lies,

00:11:10.051 --> 00:11:12.384
how can our technology be used?

00:11:13.027 --> 00:11:16.573
One application is in education.

00:11:16.597 --> 00:11:21.258
For example, using this technology,
we can help this mathematics teacher

00:11:21.282 --> 00:11:24.189
to identify the student in his classroom

00:11:24.213 --> 00:11:28.958
who may experience high anxiety
about the topic he's teaching

00:11:28.982 --> 00:11:30.491
so that he can help him.

00:11:31.337 --> 00:11:34.077
And also we can use this in health care.

00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:37.469
For example, every day I Skype my parents,

00:11:37.493 --> 00:11:39.575
who live thousands of miles away.

00:11:40.178 --> 00:11:41.999
And using this technology,

00:11:42.023 --> 00:11:45.505
I can not only find out
what's going on in their lives

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:51.831
but also simultaneously monitor
their heart rate, their stress level,

00:11:51.855 --> 00:11:55.080
their mood and whether or not
they are experiencing pain.

00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:57.649
And perhaps in the future,

00:11:57.673 --> 00:12:00.962
their risks for heart attack
or hypertension.

00:12:01.701 --> 00:12:02.961
And you may ask:

00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:08.953
Can we use this also to reveal
politicians' emotions?

00:12:08.977 --> 00:12:10.517
(Laughter)

00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:12.395
For example, during a debate.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.673
Well, the answer is yes.

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.111
Using TV footage,

00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:21.181
we could detect
the politicians' heart rate,

00:12:21.205 --> 00:12:23.251
mood and stress,

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:26.853
and perhaps in the future,
whether or not they are lying to us.

00:12:27.495 --> 00:12:30.491
We can also use this
in marketing research,

00:12:30.515 --> 00:12:32.366
for example, to find out

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:36.745
whether or not people like
certain consumer products.

00:12:37.229 --> 00:12:39.467
We can even use it in dating.

00:12:39.904 --> 00:12:41.064
So for example,

00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:43.682
if your date is smiling at you,

00:12:43.706 --> 00:12:46.500
this technology can help you to determine

00:12:46.524 --> 00:12:49.131
whether she actually likes you

00:12:49.155 --> 00:12:51.330
or she is just trying to be nice to you.

00:12:51.864 --> 00:12:53.559
And in this case,

00:12:53.583 --> 00:12:55.459
she is just trying to be nice to you.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:57.875
(Laughter)

00:12:59.244 --> 00:13:02.953
So transdermal optical imaging technology

00:13:02.977 --> 00:13:05.555
is at a very early stage of development.

00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:09.693
Many new applications will come about
that we don't know today.

00:13:10.293 --> 00:13:13.071
However, one thing I know for sure

00:13:13.095 --> 00:13:16.509
is that lying will never
be the same again.

00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:17.691
Thank you very much.

00:13:17.715 --> 00:13:19.039
Xiè xie.

00:13:19.063 --> 00:13:22.969
(Applause)
