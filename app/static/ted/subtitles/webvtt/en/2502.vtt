00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.556
I've got a confession.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.138
I love looking through people's garbage.

00:00:05.812 --> 00:00:07.717
Now, it's not some creepy thing.

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.907
I'm usually just looking
for old electronics,

00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.357
stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.

00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:16.020
I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.

00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:18.653
Each one's got three different motors,

00:00:18.677 --> 00:00:20.614
so now you can build things that move.

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:23.353
There's switches so you can
turn things on and off.

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:25.235
There's even a freaking laser,

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.035
so you can make a cool robot
into an awesome robot.

00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:33.944
Now, I've built
a lot of stuff out of garbage,

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:36.749
and some of these things
have even been kind of useful.

00:00:36.773 --> 00:00:37.958
But here's the thing,

00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:40.583
for me, garbage is just a chance to play,

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:43.530
to be creative and build things
to amuse myself.

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:47.190
This is what I love doing,
so I just made it part of my day job.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:49.771
I lead a university-based
biological research lab,

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:53.732
where we value curiosity
and exploration above all else.

00:00:53.756 --> 00:00:56.352
We aren't focused
on any particular problem,

00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:58.938
and we're not trying to solve
any particular disease.

00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:01.646
This is just a place where people can come

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.446
and ask fascinating questions
and find answers.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.335
And I realized a long time ago

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.601
that if I challenge people
to build the equipment they need

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:12.738
out of the garbage I find,

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:15.525
it's a great way to foster creativity.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.700
And what happened

00:01:16.724 --> 00:01:19.605
was that artists and scientists
from around the world

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:21.645
started coming to my lab.

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:24.878
And it's not just because
we value unconventional ideas,

00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:27.220
it's because we test and validate them

00:01:27.244 --> 00:01:28.671
with scientific rigor.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.521
So one day I was hacking something,
I was taking it apart,

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:35.402
and I had this sudden idea:

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:38.865
Could I treat biology like hardware?

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.140
Could I dismantle a biological system,

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:42.587
mix and match the parts

00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:45.565
and then put it back together
in some new and creative way?

00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:48.030
My lab started working on this,

00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:49.947
and I want to show you the result.

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:54.291
Can any of you guys
tell me what fruit this is?

00:01:55.278 --> 00:01:56.429
Audience: Apple!

00:01:56.453 --> 00:01:58.610
Andrew Pelling:
That's right -- it's an apple.

00:01:58.634 --> 00:02:00.643
Now, I actually want you to notice as well

00:02:00.657 --> 00:02:03.461
that this is a lot redder
than most apples.

00:02:04.294 --> 00:02:07.020
And that's because
we grew human cells into it.

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:11.222
We took a totally innocent
Macintosh apple,

00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:14.265
removed all the apple cells and DNA

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.308
and then implanted human cells.

00:02:16.332 --> 00:02:19.381
And what we're left with
after removing all the apple cells

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.146
is this cellulose scaffold.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.307
This is the stuff that gives plants
their shape and texture.

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:26.303
And these little holes that you can see,

00:02:26.327 --> 00:02:28.728
this is where all
the apple cells used to be.

00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:30.438
So then we come along,

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:33.524
we implant some mammalian cells
that you can see in blue.

00:02:33.548 --> 00:02:35.756
What happens is,
these guys start multiplying

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.774
and they fill up this entire scaffold.

00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:40.222
As weird as this is,

00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:44.931
it's actually really reminiscent
of how our own tissues are organized.

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:47.208
And we found in our pre-clinical work

00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:49.628
that you can implant
these scaffolds into the body,

00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:52.335
and the body will send in cells
and a blood supply

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.574
and actually keep these things alive.

00:02:55.348 --> 00:02:58.445
This is the point
when people started asking me,

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.016
"Andrew, can you make
body parts out of apples?"

00:03:03.794 --> 00:03:06.025
And I'm like, "You've come
to the right place."

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.326
(Laughter)

00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:09.900
I actually brought this up with my wife.

00:03:09.924 --> 00:03:11.658
She's a musical instrument maker,

00:03:11.682 --> 00:03:13.995
and she does a lot
of wood carving for a living.

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.260
So I asked her,

00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:20.102
"Could you, like,
literally carve some ears

00:03:20.126 --> 00:03:21.658
out of an apple for us?"

00:03:21.682 --> 00:03:23.133
And she did.

00:03:23.157 --> 00:03:25.929
So I took her ears to the lab.

00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:27.706
We then started preparing them.

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.316
Yeah, I know.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.373
(Laughter)

00:03:33.397 --> 00:03:35.115
It's a good lab, man.

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.600
(Laughter)

00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:38.331
And then we grew cells on them.

00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:40.393
And this is the result.

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:46.349
Listen, my lab is not
in the ear-manufacturing business.

00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:51.114
People have actually been working
on this for decades.

00:03:51.138 --> 00:03:52.786
Here's the issue:

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.216
commercial scaffolds can be
really expensive and problematic,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.841
because they're sourced
from proprietary products,

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:01.968
animals or cadavers.

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.135
We used an apple and it cost pennies.

00:04:10.873 --> 00:04:12.910
What's also really cool here

00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:15.079
is it's not that hard
to make these things.

00:04:15.103 --> 00:04:18.035
The equipment you need
can be built from garbage,

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:22.242
and the key processing step
only requires soap and water.

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:26.708
So what we did was put all
the instructions online as open source.

00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:29.529
And then we founded
a mission-driven company,

00:04:29.553 --> 00:04:31.931
and we're developing kits
to make it easier

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:34.526
for anyone with a sink
and a soldering iron

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.108
to make these things at home.

00:04:36.132 --> 00:04:40.205
What I'm really curious
about is if one day,

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.480
it will be possible to repair, rebuild
and augment our own bodies

00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:47.500
with stuff we make in the kitchen.

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:51.418
Speaking of kitchens,

00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:53.378
here's some asparagus.

00:04:53.402 --> 00:04:56.085
They're tasty, and they make
your pee smell funny.

00:04:56.109 --> 00:04:57.362
(Laughter)

00:04:57.386 --> 00:05:00.009
Now, I was in my kitchen,
and I was noticing

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:02.619
that when you look down
the stalks of these asparagus,

00:05:02.643 --> 00:05:05.634
what you can see
are all these tiny little vessels.

00:05:05.658 --> 00:05:07.307
And when we image them in the lab,

00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:10.320
you can see how the cellulose
forms these structures.

00:05:10.832 --> 00:05:13.105
This image reminds me of two things:

00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:15.583
our blood vessels

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:19.355
and the structure and organization
of our nerves and spinal cord.

00:05:19.854 --> 00:05:21.151
So here's the question:

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.040
Can we grow axons and neurons
down these channels?

00:05:26.064 --> 00:05:27.690
Because if we can,

00:05:27.714 --> 00:05:31.981
then maybe we can use asparagus
to form new connections

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:34.862
between the ends of damaged
and severed nerves.

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:37.430
Or maybe even a spinal cord.

00:05:38.126 --> 00:05:39.412
Don't get me wrong --

00:05:39.436 --> 00:05:41.440
this is exceptionally challenging

00:05:41.464 --> 00:05:43.059
and really hard work to do,

00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:45.701
and we are not the only ones
working on this.

00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:49.056
But we are the only ones using asparagus.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.587
(Laughter)

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.178
Right now, we've got
really promising pilot data.

00:05:55.202 --> 00:05:57.085
And we're working with tissue engineers

00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:58.275
and neurosurgeons

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:00.195
to find out what's actually possible.

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:03.347
So listen, all of the work I've shown you,

00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:06.564
the stuff that I've built
that's all around me on this stage

00:06:06.588 --> 00:06:09.258
and the other projects
my lab is involved in

00:06:09.282 --> 00:06:13.369
are all a direct result
of me playing with your garbage.

00:06:13.393 --> 00:06:19.430
Play -- play is a key part
of my scientific practice.

00:06:19.454 --> 00:06:23.438
It's how I train my mind
to be unconventional and to be creative

00:06:23.462 --> 00:06:26.467
and to decide to make human apple ears.

00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:31.142
So, the next time any of you
are looking at some old,

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:35.745
broken-down, malfunctioning,
piece-of-crap technology,

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:37.366
I want you to think of me.

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.357
Because I want it.

00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:40.532
(Laughter)

00:06:40.556 --> 00:06:44.563
Seriously, please find any way
to get in touch with me,

00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:46.528
and let's see what we can build.

00:06:46.552 --> 00:06:47.703
Thank you.

00:06:47.727 --> 00:06:52.270
(Applause)
