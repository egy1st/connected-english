WEBVTT

00:00:00.764 --> 00:00:06.564
So we spend a 12th of our life dreaming,

00:00:06.588 --> 00:00:08.380
and most of it is forgotten.

00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:12.187
What if we could peek inside our brain
and see our dreams,

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.064
maybe even shape them?

00:00:14.684 --> 00:00:19.549
I am a neuroscientist, and I study
how thinking works inside the brain.

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:22.501
But this story starts five years ago,

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:27.179
when my work was about to be
published broadly,

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:31.099
and one slip of a tongue
made me take a big turn.

00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:35.073
It was October 28th, and I woke up
because my phone was buzzing.

00:00:35.596 --> 00:00:38.795
I look at the phone and I see
that I have hundreds of missed calls.

00:00:39.843 --> 00:00:41.287
So I pick up the phone,

00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:43.921
and on the other line
is a producer from the BBC,

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:47.876
and in a thick British accent,
he asks me about my work

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.777
and specifically about my team's ability
to record people's dreams

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.554
for the first time in history.

00:00:53.578 --> 00:00:58.395
Now, just to be clear, my work had nothing
to do with recording people's dreams.

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:59.834
(Laughter)

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:02.516
Apparently, he saw a short movie

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.746
that I made to accompany the publication
that's about to come out,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.040
and I'm explaining the results there,

00:01:09.064 --> 00:01:13.461
but I want to end with something
that's like a TED-like uplifting message,

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:17.177
so I ask one of my colleagues
to explain what the future may hold.

00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:19.455
And he says, "In the future,

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.543
we'll be able to decode
people's intentions, people's memories,

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:25.436
people's emotions --
and maybe even their dreams."

00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:27.256
And the camera fades out.

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:31.429
So I explained to the producer
that we didn't actually do that.

00:01:31.453 --> 00:01:32.469
(Laughter)

00:01:32.493 --> 00:01:33.859
And he asks me,

00:01:33.883 --> 00:01:36.124
"But is it possible
to record people's dreams?"

00:01:36.148 --> 00:01:37.970
And I say, "In theory, it's possible."

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:39.094
"Thank you, bye."

00:01:39.118 --> 00:01:40.227
(Laughter)

00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:43.449
Five minutes later, the headline on BBC:

00:01:43.473 --> 00:01:46.608
"Scientist claims
dream recording is possible."

00:01:46.632 --> 00:01:49.128
(Laughter)

00:01:49.152 --> 00:01:53.010
Within minutes, the entire world
picks up on this headline,

00:01:53.034 --> 00:01:56.320
and everyone speaks about my team's
ability to record people's dreams.

00:01:56.344 --> 00:01:58.027
(Laughter)

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.915
It doesn't matter how much I explained
to everyone that this was impossible.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.558
The story now has a life of its own.

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:05.875
(Laughter)

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.864
So I call my dad, who is a journalist,

00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:11.395
and I ask him,
"Dad, how can I kill a story?"

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.823
And he says, "No problem,
just turn off the phone.

00:02:13.847 --> 00:02:15.244
No one cares about science."

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:16.553
So I turn off the phone --

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:18.569
(Laughter)

00:02:18.593 --> 00:02:19.754
(Applause)

00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:21.810
and people start emailing me their dreams.

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:23.237
(Laughter)

00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:28.137
A famous chef asks me if I can
open his brain and extract a recipe

00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:29.788
he's been dreaming of for a while.

00:02:29.812 --> 00:02:30.904
(Laughter)

00:02:30.928 --> 00:02:33.495
People ask me to look
into their spouse's dreams.

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.710
Others, who finally have a proof
that the CIA is spying on them,

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:38.566
want me to go and testify in Congress.

00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:40.821
Warner Brothers calls me.

00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:44.803
They want me to be the face
of the upcoming DVD release

00:02:44.827 --> 00:02:46.685
of the movie "Inception,"

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.250
to show the science behind it.

00:02:48.274 --> 00:02:50.027
(Laughter)

00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:51.663
And a big computer company

00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:56.091
wanted to option
the "dream-recording machine,"

00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:58.227
because my device now has a name,

00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:00.133
it has specifications,

00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:02.125
it had Wikipedia pages

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.164
and fans all over the world.

00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:06.126
(Laughter)

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.086
To make things worse --

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.467
(Laughter)

00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:12.533
my students had the idea
to go out to a Halloween party

00:03:12.557 --> 00:03:14.205
to forget about things,

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.148
so I decided, in a
self-depreciative sense of humor,

00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:20.275
to dress up like Sigmund Freud.

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.568
(Laughter)

00:03:21.592 --> 00:03:23.831
So now there is not only
just a story about me

00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:26.411
but also a nice visual to go with it,

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:31.466
and I am deemed by the media now
the modern-day Freud.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.856
This story went on for a few weeks,

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.300
until, fortunately, Prince William
proposed to his girlfriend,

00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:38.792
which was much more important,

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:40.522
and I got to go back to my work.

00:03:40.546 --> 00:03:44.966
(Applause)

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.696
Now, if you were interested
in studying dreams,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.957
I would recommend starting first

00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:53.703
by just looking at people's thoughts
when they are awake,

00:03:53.727 --> 00:03:54.941
and this is what I do.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.874
So I am indeed a neuroscientist,

00:03:57.898 --> 00:04:00.781
but I study the brain
in a very non-traditional way,

00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:02.948
partially inspired by my background.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.508
Before I became a neuroscientist,
I was a computer hacker.

00:04:06.944 --> 00:04:09.879
I used to break into banks
and government institutes

00:04:09.903 --> 00:04:11.923
to test their security.

00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:16.241
And I wanted to use the same
techniques that hackers use

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:18.567
to look inside black boxes

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.560
when I wanted to study the brain,

00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:23.665
looking from the inside out.

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:27.363
Now, neuroscientists study the brain
in one of two typical methods.

00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:29.736
Some of them look at the brain
from the outside

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.124
using imaging techniques like EEG or fMRI.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:36.900
And the problem there is that the signal
is very kind of blurry, coarse.

00:04:36.924 --> 00:04:40.257
So others look at the brain
from the inside,

00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:42.383
where they stick electrodes
inside the brain

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:45.582
and listen to brain cells
speaking their own language.

00:04:45.606 --> 00:04:47.170
This is very precise,

00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:49.534
but this obviously can be done
only with animals.

00:04:50.518 --> 00:04:54.041
Now, if you were to peek inside the brain

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:55.802
and listen to it speak,

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:58.809
what you would see
is that it has this electrochemical signal

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.467
that you can translate to sound,

00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:05.072
and this sound is
the common currency of the brain.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.694
It sounds something like this.

00:05:06.718 --> 00:05:10.928
(Clicking)

00:05:10.952 --> 00:05:15.975
So I wanted to use this in humans,

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:17.880
but who would let you do that?

00:05:19.296 --> 00:05:22.750
Patients who undergo brain surgery.

00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:26.900
So I partner with neurosurgeons
across the globe

00:05:26.924 --> 00:05:28.995
who employ this unique procedure

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:32.066
where they open the skull of patients,

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.632
they stick electrodes in the brain
to find the source of the problem,

00:05:35.656 --> 00:05:38.498
and finding the source
can take days or sometimes weeks,

00:05:38.522 --> 00:05:41.437
so this gives us a unique opportunity

00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:46.917
to eavesdrop on the brains of patients
while they are awake and behaving

00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:49.893
and they have their skull open
with electrodes inside.

00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:55.800
So now that we do that, we want to find
what triggers those cells active,

00:05:55.824 --> 00:05:57.045
what makes them tick.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:00.387
So what we do is we run
studies like this one.

00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:02.982
This is Linda, one of our patients.

00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:05.243
She is sitting here
and watching those clips.

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:07.314
(Video) ... can't even begin to imagine.

00:06:07.338 --> 00:06:09.877
(Singing)

00:06:09.901 --> 00:06:15.916
Moran Cerf: What you hear is the sound
of one cell in her brain.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.437
Try to see if you can figure out
what it cares about.

00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:20.583
(Clicking)

00:06:20.607 --> 00:06:22.607
(Video) ... I have a dream that one day --

00:06:22.631 --> 00:06:26.456
(Clicking increases)

00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:28.488
The Simpsons.

00:06:28.512 --> 00:06:29.663
(Laughter)

00:06:29.687 --> 00:06:32.623
This is one cell out of a little network

00:06:32.647 --> 00:06:36.313
that's bound hand and fist
with the concept of The Simpsons

00:06:36.337 --> 00:06:37.488
in Linda's brain.

00:06:37.512 --> 00:06:39.384
Now, if you know what The Simpsons are,

00:06:39.408 --> 00:06:41.601
then you all have
similar cells in your brain

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:44.982
that came to life right now
when you saw this image.

00:06:45.953 --> 00:06:47.851
Now, those cells are amazing.

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:49.198
They're very precise.

00:06:49.222 --> 00:06:52.857
They don't fire for any cartoon character
or any yellow creature.

00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:53.882
(Laughter)

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:58.732
They only fire when you think
of The Simpsons.

00:06:58.756 --> 00:07:01.192
They fire when you see
any picture of The Simpsons.

00:07:01.216 --> 00:07:03.295
Even if you hear the sound
of The Simpsons,

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:06.455
or just read the text, "The Simpsons,"
these cells will fire.

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.526
In fact, they fire
even if you close your eyes

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.073
and just imagine The Simpsons
in your own head.

00:07:12.097 --> 00:07:15.485
We can remove the world,
and the show still goes on.

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:18.016
And we know that because
we came back to Linda

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.088
and asked her now,
without saying anything,

00:07:20.112 --> 00:07:22.476
to just close her eyes
and recall from her memory

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.064
the things she has seen before,

00:07:24.088 --> 00:07:27.381
and what you see is that
as she remembers The Simpsons,

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:29.881
the same cell fires.

00:07:30.438 --> 00:07:33.406
In fact, it fires seconds
before she speaks.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.049
(Clicking)

00:07:35.073 --> 00:07:37.827
(Video) The Simpsons.

00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:39.001
(Laughter)

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:41.913
So we get to see her thoughts
coming to her.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.305
Now, this is remarkable,
because when I speak to you right now,

00:07:45.329 --> 00:07:48.400
I feel that everything that I have to say
comes out in real time.

00:07:48.424 --> 00:07:51.305
But now you can tell
that we're actually a little bit behind.

00:07:51.329 --> 00:07:56.112
My brain plans the next word.

00:07:56.136 --> 00:07:58.329
That's the slowest I could ever speak.

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:00.373
(Laughter)

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:04.880
So once we find such cells in her brain --
Bart Simpson, mom, dad,

00:08:04.914 --> 00:08:07.916
the Eiffel Tower -- we can essentially
know what she's thinking,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.428
and then we can do all sorts of fancy
stuff that is based on those cells.

00:08:11.452 --> 00:08:14.252
For example, we can have her
think of her mom

00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:16.800
and just move a spaceship
on a computer screen

00:08:16.824 --> 00:08:18.141
with her thoughts alone.

00:08:18.944 --> 00:08:21.857
If we can actually show your thoughts,

00:08:21.881 --> 00:08:24.873
we can just project them on a screen
in front of your eyes.

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:27.991
And this is what we did five years ago.

00:08:28.015 --> 00:08:30.878
So naturally, when people saw
thoughts on a screen,

00:08:30.902 --> 00:08:34.761
they started imagining the possibility
of decoding dreams in the same way.

00:08:35.437 --> 00:08:37.667
Which we did not do.

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:39.682
(Laughter)

00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:40.992
Until two years ago.

00:08:41.016 --> 00:08:42.237
(Laughter)

00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:44.097
When I got a call from the BBC again,

00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:46.094
and they asked me about dream recording,

00:08:46.118 --> 00:08:49.062
I told them, "You know,
we've been through it before."

00:08:49.086 --> 00:08:51.514
And they said, "No, we actually
want you to comment

00:08:51.538 --> 00:08:54.134
on the work of someone that just came out

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:55.815
that shows that this can be done."

00:08:56.244 --> 00:09:00.108
So it turns out, three years
after I explained to everyone

00:09:00.132 --> 00:09:02.536
why this was only theoretically possible,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.586
a colleague of mine,
Professor Yukiyasu Kamitani from Japan,

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.498
was inspired by it and did it.

00:09:07.955 --> 00:09:10.288
And that's when I decided
I want to do it myself.

00:09:10.812 --> 00:09:15.161
So I decided I'm going to dive
into dream research in two paths.

00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:19.007
The researcher in me said I'm going
to try to see if we can access them

00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:20.213
and show them,

00:09:20.237 --> 00:09:23.280
and the hacker in me said
I want to see if we can influence them

00:09:23.324 --> 00:09:25.168
and change people's behaviors.

00:09:25.657 --> 00:09:28.910
Looking into dreams
is really interesting, obviously,

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:30.530
but it's also very helpful.

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:35.980
And the reason is that we don't really
know what we're dreaming precisely

00:09:36.004 --> 00:09:37.868
if we just rely on what you tell us,

00:09:37.892 --> 00:09:40.994
because the language that you use
is unreliable for two reasons.

00:09:41.018 --> 00:09:43.200
One, they fade away when we wake up.

00:09:43.224 --> 00:09:44.375
And this is by design:

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:48.232
this is our brain's way of making sure
we don't confuse them with real memories,

00:09:48.256 --> 00:09:50.668
so you don't think
you actually scored a touchdown

00:09:50.692 --> 00:09:52.357
and had dinner with Aaron Sorkin.

00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:55.698
And if you actually remember something,

00:09:55.722 --> 00:09:59.658
we only describe them in the vocabulary
that we have when we're awake.

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:03.800
So blind people usually don't describe
their dreams visually,

00:10:03.824 --> 00:10:06.451
because sight isn't in their vocabulary.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.603
Or, if anyone here is in their 70s,

00:10:09.627 --> 00:10:11.741
it's very likely
that when you were younger,

00:10:11.765 --> 00:10:14.193
you described your dreams
in black and white.

00:10:14.217 --> 00:10:16.616
Only when people started seeing
movies in color

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.304
did they think that dreams
should be in color too.

00:10:19.843 --> 00:10:21.980
So looking into dreams
is really interesting.

00:10:22.004 --> 00:10:25.270
It's allowing us to actually
get access to something that you forget.

00:10:25.294 --> 00:10:28.644
Imagine giving Einstein, Shakespeare
or Picasso access to the dreams

00:10:28.668 --> 00:10:29.983
they forget in the morning.

00:10:30.007 --> 00:10:31.436
We were very excited about it,

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.537
and we said, let's try
to do it. But how?

00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:34.864
And then we had the idea:

00:10:34.888 --> 00:10:37.230
maybe the same neurons
that fire when you're awake

00:10:37.254 --> 00:10:38.976
survive even when you're sleeping.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.731
After all, it's the same brain.
It's us, awake or asleep.

00:10:41.755 --> 00:10:44.851
So my colleague Florian Mormann
had the idea to go to the patient

00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:48.447
and tell them a story that involved
the things that we find during the day.

00:10:48.471 --> 00:10:49.916
So Bart Simpson visits Paris,

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.479
he goes to a Beatles concert
with Al Gore, and so on.

00:10:52.503 --> 00:10:55.463
Then he asks the patient
to memorize the story and go to sleep,

00:10:55.487 --> 00:10:58.534
and tells them, when you wake up,
I'll ask you to tell it again.

00:10:58.558 --> 00:11:01.303
And what he shows
is that when they're sleeping,

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:04.747
the brain replays the same story

00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:06.040
using the same neurons

00:11:06.088 --> 00:11:08.971
as if you see the story in your mind,
and this is remarkable.

00:11:08.995 --> 00:11:11.618
Now we don't know
if the story that she sees

00:11:11.642 --> 00:11:13.452
is the same as the one that we decode.

00:11:13.476 --> 00:11:17.307
Maybe in her mind, Al Gore is holding
a balloon and Bart Simpson is blue.

00:11:17.331 --> 00:11:20.657
But something about the content
is preserved, and we can now decode it.

00:11:20.682 --> 00:11:22.063
So we were very excited.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:27.220
But we said, this is still people
with open brains, electrodes inside.

00:11:27.244 --> 00:11:28.901
Can we do it with everyone?

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:32.929
And here, our colleagues from Japan
show us that the answer is yes.

00:11:32.953 --> 00:11:34.429
We can zoom out from the brain

00:11:34.453 --> 00:11:37.175
and actually bring people
and try to look at their dreams.

00:11:37.199 --> 00:11:39.552
Now, when you zoom out,
the resolution decreases,

00:11:39.576 --> 00:11:41.821
so instead of seeing
Bart Simpson and Al Gore,

00:11:41.845 --> 00:11:43.741
you will see maybe that it's a person

00:11:43.765 --> 00:11:45.932
or an object or some character,

00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:48.098
but something about
the content is preserved.

00:11:48.122 --> 00:11:49.542
And maybe we can look at it.

00:11:49.566 --> 00:11:51.485
So we brought people to the scanner

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:52.855
and had them fall asleep,

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.664
and fortunately, from my experience,

00:11:54.688 --> 00:11:57.560
people fall asleep in my studies
all the time.

00:11:57.584 --> 00:11:59.012
And while they are sleeping,

00:11:59.036 --> 00:12:01.934
the computer tries to guess
what they're dreaming

00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.521
using those high-level concepts.

00:12:03.545 --> 00:12:05.224
Is it a person? Is it a character?

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.656
And once the computer
is getting good in making a guess

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.544
on what you're dreaming,

00:12:11.568 --> 00:12:12.791
we wake you up

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:14.615
and we ask you to tell us the story.

00:12:15.108 --> 00:12:19.743
And what we show is that the computer
is amazing in just learning over time

00:12:19.767 --> 00:12:20.950
to guess your dream

00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:24.735
and predict something about the gist
of the story that you saw in your mind.

00:12:25.386 --> 00:12:28.449
So now we're pretty excited,
because we have a way to get there,

00:12:28.473 --> 00:12:31.610
working both internally and externally.

00:12:32.349 --> 00:12:35.309
So this gets us now to thinking
about the ability

00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:38.769
to maybe also change things
when you are asleep.

00:12:39.807 --> 00:12:41.569
To change things when you are asleep,

00:12:41.593 --> 00:12:44.259
you have to know something
about the function of dreams.

00:12:44.283 --> 00:12:47.695
And here neuroscientists are debating,
and the range of options is wide.

00:12:47.719 --> 00:12:50.972
Some say the function of dreams
is to forget things, erase memories

00:12:50.996 --> 00:12:52.146
or suppress thoughts,

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.431
whereas the others say that this is
our brain's way of simulating futures,

00:12:56.455 --> 00:12:59.984
so you're kind of thinking about
dumping him and moving to Vancouver

00:13:00.008 --> 00:13:02.575
or marrying him
and starting a family in Alabama.

00:13:02.599 --> 00:13:03.868
You don't know the answer.

00:13:03.892 --> 00:13:06.002
Your brain is going
to simulate both options

00:13:06.026 --> 00:13:08.811
and give you something
to think about when you wake up.

00:13:08.835 --> 00:13:11.549
But regardless of whichever
option you believe in,

00:13:11.573 --> 00:13:12.964
what's common to all of them

00:13:12.988 --> 00:13:15.992
is that during the night,
we think that this is our brain's way

00:13:16.016 --> 00:13:21.149
of keeping ourselves up
and crafting answers to problems.

00:13:21.173 --> 00:13:25.474
So we said that if we define
the right moment,

00:13:25.498 --> 00:13:27.685
we can maybe change things in your dreams.

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:29.636
Now, this of course is quite spooky,

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.294
the idea that something
happens to me when I'm sleeping.

00:13:32.318 --> 00:13:35.115
But we're going to show you
how we're using that.

00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:37.430
So a colleague of mine
brought people to the lab

00:13:37.454 --> 00:13:38.900
who are addicted smokers,

00:13:38.924 --> 00:13:40.557
and she had them go to sleep.

00:13:41.168 --> 00:13:45.084
And during the sleep, she sprayed
the smell of cigarettes into their nose.

00:13:45.108 --> 00:13:46.429
And right after,

00:13:46.453 --> 00:13:48.938
she sprayed the smell
of rotten eggs into their nose,

00:13:48.962 --> 00:13:51.445
making their brain think
they don't like smoking.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.532
And then she wakes them up.

00:13:54.103 --> 00:13:55.997
They have no idea what happened,

00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:58.272
but somehow their brain
creates this pairing.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.749
So when they leave the lab,
for a few days after,

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.796
they feel less of an urge to smoke.

00:14:03.407 --> 00:14:04.669
And then we said,

00:14:04.693 --> 00:14:08.838
let's see if we can do the same thing
with people whose awake realities

00:14:08.862 --> 00:14:10.917
haunt them when they are awake

00:14:10.941 --> 00:14:12.624
and when they're sleeping,

00:14:12.648 --> 00:14:14.202
like Nicholas.

00:14:14.226 --> 00:14:17.727
He was discharged from the Army
after his service in Iraq

00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:20.083
because he has post-traumatic stress.

00:14:20.512 --> 00:14:22.580
His awake reality bothers him,

00:14:22.604 --> 00:14:24.312
and he is unable to solve it.

00:14:24.336 --> 00:14:25.581
So we got him into the lab

00:14:25.605 --> 00:14:28.117
and had him to go sleep
for several nights.

00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:34.275
And every night, we paired the sounds
that trigger the traumas

00:14:34.299 --> 00:14:35.925
in his brain when he is awake,

00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:38.529
and immediately after,
sprayed positive smells

00:14:38.553 --> 00:14:41.226
to create some changes in his brain.

00:14:41.743 --> 00:14:43.345
(Gunfire)

00:14:44.089 --> 00:14:45.320
So we slowly, overnight,

00:14:45.344 --> 00:14:48.898
used the fact that our brains
and our memories are not fixed.

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:51.263
They're malleable.
They change as we use them.

00:14:51.287 --> 00:14:53.945
So we make his brain
remember something and override it,

00:14:53.969 --> 00:14:57.418
remember, and override it in his dream.

00:14:57.442 --> 00:15:00.378
And then when he wakes up,
he again has no idea what happened,

00:15:00.402 --> 00:15:03.870
but suddenly he feels
less of this anxiety when he is up.

00:15:05.163 --> 00:15:09.639
And this has been going on
for a few months now with Nicholas.

00:15:10.655 --> 00:15:12.377
So we are pretty excited about that,

00:15:12.401 --> 00:15:16.274
and now we're trying to see if there is
a way to help other people in the same way

00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:19.742
by working with them
when they are awake in one way

00:15:19.766 --> 00:15:22.472
and with the same brain
when they are asleep.

00:15:22.496 --> 00:15:26.415
And we are thinking about
other ways to enhance experiences

00:15:26.439 --> 00:15:29.019
using the opportunity
that your dream provides.

00:15:29.351 --> 00:15:33.010
For example, what if we can teach you
things when you are asleep?

00:15:33.034 --> 00:15:36.359
So you go to sleep
and you wake up knowing kung fu.

00:15:36.383 --> 00:15:37.390
(Laughter)

00:15:37.414 --> 00:15:41.779
Or two people sleep side by side,
and we can share dreams simultaneously.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.731
Or just help you navigate your dream
to a specific location.

00:15:45.755 --> 00:15:48.381
A lot of things in our life
are owed to dreams.

00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:51.278
The periodic table. Hitchcock's movies.

00:15:51.302 --> 00:15:54.369
What if we can help you focus your dreams
on something specific?

00:15:54.393 --> 00:15:56.489
Or, I know there are a lot
of engineers here.

00:15:56.513 --> 00:15:58.803
What if I can build a device
that helps guarantee

00:15:58.827 --> 00:16:00.350
a positive sleep for everyone?

00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:04.040
We are not there yet.

00:16:04.064 --> 00:16:07.063
But if there is one thing
I learned from the last five years,

00:16:07.087 --> 00:16:10.283
it is that saying that something
is impossible before you know it

00:16:10.307 --> 00:16:11.515
is a mistake.

00:16:12.452 --> 00:16:15.228
Because science
isn't just about collecting facts,

00:16:15.252 --> 00:16:20.680
it's also about enabling promises,
hunches and even dreams.

00:16:21.656 --> 00:16:25.536
Neuroscientists are now giving us
a new tool to control our dreams,

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.155
a new platform to create experiences on,

00:16:28.179 --> 00:16:31.305
a new canvas that flickers to life
when we fall asleep.

00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:34.756
So designers, perfumers,
musicians, filmmakers

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.478
can now use this
to create new experiences.

00:16:38.518 --> 00:16:40.747
Because in the end,

00:16:40.771 --> 00:16:43.589
we are now able to, for the first time,

00:16:43.613 --> 00:16:48.200
help people change behavior
and understand ourselves better

00:16:48.224 --> 00:16:53.335
by essentially teaching ourselves
to dream bigger.

00:16:54.104 --> 00:16:55.255
Thank you.

00:16:55.279 --> 00:17:02.019
(Applause)
