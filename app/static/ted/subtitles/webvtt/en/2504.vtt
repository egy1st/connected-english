00:00:02.151 --> 00:00:03.568
By raising your hand,

00:00:03.592 --> 00:00:07.207
how many of you know
at least one person on the screen?

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:10.234
Wow, it's almost a full house.

00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:12.815
It's true, they are very famous
in their fields.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.834
And do you know what
all of them have in common?

00:00:15.858 --> 00:00:18.778
They all died of pancreatic cancer.

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:21.310
However, although it's very,
very sad this news,

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:24.098
it's also thanks to their personal stories

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:28.243
that we have raised awareness
of how lethal this disease can be.

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:31.643
It's become the third cause
of cancer deaths,

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:37.193
and only eight percent of the patients
will survive beyond five years.

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:39.136
That's a very tiny number,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.916
especially if you compare it
with breast cancer,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.380
where the survival rate
is almost 90 percent.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:48.313
So it doesn't really come as a surprise

00:00:48.337 --> 00:00:50.802
that being diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:54.077
means facing an almost
certain death sentence.

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:57.747
What's shocking, though,
is that in the last 40 years,

00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:00.149
this number hasn't changed a bit,

00:01:00.173 --> 00:01:02.277
while much more progress has been made

00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:03.988
with other types of tumors.

00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:08.212
So how can we make pancreatic cancer
treatment more effective?

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.565
As a biomedical entrepreneur,

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:13.608
I like to work on problems
that seem impossible,

00:01:13.632 --> 00:01:15.693
understanding their limitations

00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:18.789
and trying to find new,
innovative solutions

00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:20.644
that can change their outcome.

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:23.612
The first piece of bad news
with pancreatic cancer

00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:27.107
is that your pancreas is in the middle
of your belly, literally.

00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:29.966
It's depicted in orange on the screen.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.637
But you can barely see it

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:34.621
until I remove all the other
organs in front.

00:01:35.093 --> 00:01:38.089
It's also surrounded
by many other vital organs,

00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:41.225
like the liver, the stomach,
the bile duct.

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:44.662
And the ability of the tumor
to grow into those organs

00:01:44.686 --> 00:01:46.708
is the reason why pancreatic cancer

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:49.664
is one of the most painful tumor types.

00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:53.457
The hard-to-reach location
also prevents the doctor

00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:55.200
from surgically removing it,

00:01:55.224 --> 00:01:58.259
as is routinely done
for breast cancer, for example.

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:02.100
So all of these reasons leave
chemotherapy as the only option

00:02:02.124 --> 00:02:04.267
for the pancreatic cancer patient.

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:07.198
This brings us to the second
piece of bad news.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.187
Pancreatic cancer tumors have
very few blood vessels.

00:02:11.624 --> 00:02:15.410
Why should we care
about the blood vessel of a tumor?

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:18.900
Let's think for a second
how chemotherapy works.

00:02:18.924 --> 00:02:20.813
The drug is injected in the vein

00:02:20.837 --> 00:02:25.481
and it navigates throughout the body
until it reaches the tumor site.

00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:29.680
It's like driving on a highway,
trying to reach a destination.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.965
But what if your destination
doesn't have an exit on the highway?

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.618
You will never get there.

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:37.764
And that's exactly the same problem

00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:40.481
for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.964
The drugs navigate
throughout all of your body.

00:02:43.988 --> 00:02:46.401
They will reach healthy organs,

00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:50.232
resulting in high toxic effect
for the patients overall,

00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:52.771
but very little will go to the tumor.

00:02:52.795 --> 00:02:55.223
Therefore, the efficacy is very limited.

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.333
To me, it seems very counterintuitive
to have a whole-body treatment

00:03:01.357 --> 00:03:03.621
to target a specific organ.

00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:06.097
However, in the last 40 years,

00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:10.445
a lot of money, research
and effort have gone towards

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.552
finding new, powerful drugs
to treat pancreatic cancer,

00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:16.987
but nothing has been done
in changing the way

00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:19.074
we deliver them to the patient.

00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:22.023
So after two pieces of bad news,

00:03:22.047 --> 00:03:25.076
I'm going to give you
good news, hopefully.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:27.276
With a collaborator at MIT

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.196
and the Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.133
we have revolutionized
the way we treat cancer

00:03:33.157 --> 00:03:36.500
by making localized
drug delivery a reality.

00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:40.960
We are basically parachuting you
on top of your destination,

00:03:40.984 --> 00:03:43.886
avoiding your having to drive
all around the highway.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.200
We have embedded the drug
into devices that look like this one.

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:54.413
They are flexible enough
that they can be folded

00:03:54.437 --> 00:03:56.359
to fit into the catheter,

00:03:56.383 --> 00:04:00.179
so the doctor can implant it
directly on top of the tumor

00:04:00.203 --> 00:04:02.268
with minimally invasive surgery.

00:04:02.603 --> 00:04:06.373
But they are solid enough
that once they are positioned

00:04:06.397 --> 00:04:08.088
on top of the tumor,

00:04:08.112 --> 00:04:09.881
they will act as a cage.

00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:13.056
They will actually
physically prevent the tumor

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.755
from entering other organs,

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.214
controlling the metastasis.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.743
The devices are also biodegradable.

00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:22.517
That means that once in the body,

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.426
they start dissolving,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.813
delivering the drug only locally,
slowly and more effectively

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:33.320
than what is done with the current
whole-body treatment.

00:04:33.344 --> 00:04:36.149
In pre-clinical study,
we have demonstrated

00:04:36.173 --> 00:04:38.172
that this localized approach

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:42.415
is able to improve by 12 times
the response to treatment.

00:04:42.758 --> 00:04:45.535
So we took a drug that is already known

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:49.390
and by just delivering it locally
where it's needed the most,

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:53.063
we allow a response
that is 12 times more powerful,

00:04:53.087 --> 00:04:55.848
reducing the systemic toxic effect.

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.233
We are working relentlessly to bring
this technology to the next level.

00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:04.104
We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing

00:05:04.128 --> 00:05:08.207
and the animal model required
prior to asking the FDA for approval

00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.838
for clinical trials.

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:16.100
Currently, the majority of patients
will die from pancreatic cancer.

00:05:16.124 --> 00:05:17.959
We are hoping that one day,

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:21.254
we can reduce their pain,
extend their life

00:05:21.278 --> 00:05:24.311
and potentially make pancreatic cancer

00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:25.873
a curable disease.

00:05:26.257 --> 00:05:28.977
By rethinking the way we deliver the drug,

00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:32.758
we don't only make it
more powerful and less toxic,

00:05:32.782 --> 00:05:37.567
we are also opening the door
to finding new innovative solutions

00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:40.306
for almost all other impossible problems

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.604
in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.

00:05:43.628 --> 00:05:44.789
Thank you very much.

00:05:44.813 --> 00:05:50.250
(Applause)
