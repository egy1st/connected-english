WEBVTT

00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:05.112
I worked as a war reporter for 15 years

00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:08.601
before I realized
that I really had a problem.

00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:11.207
There was something really wrong with me.

00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:14.569
This was about a year before 9/11,
and America wasn't at war yet.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:17.824
We weren't talking about PTSD.

00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:22.044
We were not yet talking
about the effect of trauma and war

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:23.852
on the human psyche.

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:26.956
I'd been in Afghanistan
for a couple of months

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.988
with the Northern Alliance
as they were fighting the Taliban.

00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:33.269
And at that point the Taliban
had an air force,

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:36.522
they had fighter planes,
they had tanks, they had artillery,

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:39.837
and we really got hammered
pretty badly a couple of times.

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:41.827
We saw some very ugly things.

00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:45.074
But I didn't really think it affected me.

00:00:45.098 --> 00:00:46.626
I didn't think much about it.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.601
I came home to New York, where I live.

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.506
Then one day I went down into the subway,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.941
and for the first time in my life,

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:56.799
I knew real fear.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.162
I had a massive panic attack.

00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:02.937
I was way more scared
than I had ever been in Afghanistan.

00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:07.493
Everything I was looking at seemed like
it was going to kill me,

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:09.810
but I couldn't explain why.

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:12.095
The trains were going too fast.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.473
There were too many people.

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:15.285
The lights were too bright.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:18.108
Everything was too loud,
everything was moving too quickly.

00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:21.460
I backed up against a support column
and just waited for it.

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:26.311
When I couldn't take it any longer,
I ran out of the subway station

00:01:26.335 --> 00:01:28.064
and walked wherever I was going.

00:01:29.648 --> 00:01:33.827
Later, I found out that what I had
was short-term PTSD:

00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:35.754
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:01:36.993 --> 00:01:40.221
We evolved as animals, as primates,
to survive periods of danger,

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:43.166
and if your life has been in danger,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.831
you want to react to unfamiliar noises.

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:49.607
You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.

00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:51.825
You want to have nightmares and flashbacks

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.658
of the thing that could kill you.

00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:57.813
You want to be angry because it makes you
predisposed to fight,

00:01:57.837 --> 00:02:01.210
or depressed, because it keeps you out
of circulation a little bit.

00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:02.922
Keeps you safe.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.458
It's not very pleasant,
but it's better than getting eaten.

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.923
Most people recover
from that pretty quickly.

00:02:10.947 --> 00:02:13.037
It takes a few weeks, a few months.

00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:16.176
I kept having panic attacks,
but they eventually went away.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.850
I had no idea it was connected
to the war that I'd seen.

00:02:18.874 --> 00:02:20.470
I just thought I was going crazy,

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:23.628
and then I thought, well,
now I'm not going crazy anymore.

00:02:25.197 --> 00:02:27.827
About 20 percent of people, however,

00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:31.142
wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.560
They are not adapted to temporary danger.

00:02:33.584 --> 00:02:36.345
They are maladapted for everyday life,

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.547
unless they get help.

00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:41.533
We know that the people
who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:44.273
are people who were abused as children,

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:46.028
who suffered trauma as children,

00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:48.670
people who have low education levels,

00:02:48.694 --> 00:02:51.252
people who have psychiatric
disorders in their family.

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:52.554
If you served in Vietnam

00:02:52.578 --> 00:02:55.272
and your brother is schizophrenic,

00:02:55.296 --> 00:02:59.412
you're way more likely to get
long-term PTSD from Vietnam.

00:03:00.571 --> 00:03:03.199
So I started to study this
as a journalist,

00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:07.391
and I realized that there was something
really strange going on.

00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:10.158
The numbers seemed to be going
in the wrong direction.

00:03:10.597 --> 00:03:12.969
Every war that we have
fought as a country,

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:14.967
starting with the Civil War,

00:03:14.991 --> 00:03:18.047
the intensity of the combat has gone down.

00:03:18.878 --> 00:03:22.258
As a result, the casualty rates
have gone down.

00:03:22.707 --> 00:03:24.662
But disability rates have gone up.

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:26.888
They should be going
in the same direction,

00:03:27.702 --> 00:03:29.951
but they're going in different directions.

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:36.713
The recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
have produced, thank God,

00:03:36.737 --> 00:03:42.081
a casualty rate about one third
of what it was in Vietnam.

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.089
But they've also created --

00:03:46.678 --> 00:03:50.024
they've also produced
three times the disability rates.

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:57.499
Around 10 percent of the US military
is actively engaged in combat,

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.777
10 percent or under.

00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.075
They're shooting at people,
killing people,

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.437
getting shot at,
seeing their friends get killed.

00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:06.014
It's incredibly traumatic.

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:08.848
But it's only about 10 percent
of our military.

00:04:08.872 --> 00:04:11.105
But about half of our military has filed

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.351
for some kind of PTSD compensation
from the government.

00:04:16.922 --> 00:04:21.617
And suicide doesn't even fit into this
in a very logical way.

00:04:22.173 --> 00:04:27.959
We've all heard the tragic statistic
of 22 vets a day, on average,

00:04:27.983 --> 00:04:30.590
in this country, killing themselves.

00:04:31.564 --> 00:04:33.054
Most people don't realize

00:04:33.078 --> 00:04:38.715
that the majority of those suicides
are veterans of the Vietnam War,

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:40.617
that generation,

00:04:40.641 --> 00:04:45.139
and their decision to take their own lives
actually might not be related

00:04:45.163 --> 00:04:47.861
to the war they fought 50 years earlier.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.814
In fact, there's no statistical connection
between combat and suicide.

00:04:52.838 --> 00:04:55.905
If you're in the military
and you're in a lot of combat,

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:58.939
you're no more likely to kill yourself
than if you weren't.

00:04:59.614 --> 00:05:00.940
In fact, one study found

00:05:00.964 --> 00:05:02.988
that if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,

00:05:03.012 --> 00:05:06.432
you're actually slightly less likely
to commit suicide later.

00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:10.896
I studied anthropology in college.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.939
I did my fieldwork
on the Navajo reservation.

00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:17.358
I wrote a thesis on Navajo
long-distance runners.

00:05:18.473 --> 00:05:22.477
And recently, while
I was researching PTSD,

00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:25.606
I had this thought.

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:29.404
I thought back to the work
I did when I was young,

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:33.497
and I thought, I bet the Navajo,
the Apache, the Comanche --

00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:36.085
I mean, these are very warlike nations --

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:39.891
I bet they weren't getting
PTSD like we do.

00:05:40.814 --> 00:05:43.806
When their warriors came back
from fighting the US military

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.438
or fighting each other,

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:50.184
I bet they pretty much just slipped
right back into tribal life.

00:05:51.635 --> 00:05:53.889
And maybe what determines

00:05:53.913 --> 00:05:56.607
the rate of long-term PTSD

00:05:56.631 --> 00:05:58.619
isn't what happened out there,

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.347
but the kind of society you come back to.

00:06:03.107 --> 00:06:08.061
And maybe if you come back
to a close, cohesive, tribal society,

00:06:08.823 --> 00:06:11.148
you can get over trauma pretty quickly.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.176
And if you come back
to an alienating, modern society,

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:20.224
you might remain traumatized
your entire life.

00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:23.359
In other words, maybe the problem
isn't them, the vets;

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.147
maybe the problem is us.

00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:31.768
Certainly, modern society
is hard on the human psyche

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:34.563
by every metric that we have.

00:06:37.043 --> 00:06:39.404
As wealth goes up in a society,

00:06:41.523 --> 00:06:45.094
the suicide rate goes up instead of down.

00:06:46.066 --> 00:06:48.156
If you live in modern society,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.316
you're up to eight times more likely

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.700
to suffer from depression in your lifetime

00:06:54.724 --> 00:06:57.612
than if you live in a poor,
agrarian society.

00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:02.514
Modern society has probably produced
the highest rates of suicide

00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:05.792
and depression and anxiety
and loneliness and child abuse

00:07:05.816 --> 00:07:07.561
ever in human history.

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:10.268
I saw one study

00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:13.334
that compared women in Nigeria,

00:07:13.358 --> 00:07:15.855
one of the most chaotic
and violent and corrupt

00:07:16.627 --> 00:07:18.833
and poorest countries in Africa,

00:07:19.358 --> 00:07:20.649
to women in North America.

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:25.863
And the highest rates of depression
were urban women in North America.

00:07:25.887 --> 00:07:27.882
That was also the wealthiest group.

00:07:28.637 --> 00:07:32.486
So let's go back to the US military.

00:07:33.096 --> 00:07:35.614
Ten percent are in combat.

00:07:35.638 --> 00:07:40.377
Around 50 percent have filed
for PTSD compensation.

00:07:41.602 --> 00:07:46.704
So about 40 percent of veterans
really were not traumatized overseas

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:52.040
but have come home to discover
they are dangerously alienated

00:07:52.563 --> 00:07:53.889
and depressed.

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:59.278
So what is happening with them?

00:07:59.302 --> 00:08:01.119
What's going on with those people,

00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:06.786
the phantom 40 percent that are troubled
but don't understand why?

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.134
Maybe it's this:

00:08:08.158 --> 00:08:12.802
maybe they had an experience
of sort of tribal closeness

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.056
in their unit when they were overseas.

00:08:16.075 --> 00:08:18.708
They were eating together,
sleeping together,

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:21.031
doing tasks and missions together.

00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:23.594
They were trusting each other
with their lives.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.833
And then they come home

00:08:26.857 --> 00:08:28.857
and they have to give all that up

00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:33.590
and they're coming back
to a society, a modern society,

00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:37.147
which is hard on people
who weren't even in the military.

00:08:37.171 --> 00:08:38.796
It's just hard on everybody.

00:08:39.494 --> 00:08:43.417
And we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.

00:08:44.685 --> 00:08:46.377
But for a lot of these people,

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.537
maybe it's not trauma.

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:51.116
I mean, certainly,
soldiers are traumatized

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.509
and the ones who are
have to be treated for that.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.727
But a lot of them --

00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:57.981
maybe what's bothering them
is actually a kind of alienation.

00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:01.091
I mean, maybe we just have
the wrong word for some of it,

00:09:01.115 --> 00:09:03.504
and just changing our language,
our understanding,

00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:04.702
would help a little bit.

00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:07.438
"Post-deployment alienation disorder."

00:09:07.462 --> 00:09:10.340
Maybe even just calling it that
for some of these people

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:14.212
would allow them to stop imagining

00:09:14.236 --> 00:09:17.002
trying to imagine a trauma
that didn't really happen

00:09:17.707 --> 00:09:20.478
in order to explain a feeling
that really is happening.

00:09:20.502 --> 00:09:23.019
And in fact, it's an extremely
dangerous feeling.

00:09:23.043 --> 00:09:25.783
That alienation and depression
can lead to suicide.

00:09:25.807 --> 00:09:27.804
These people are in danger.

00:09:27.828 --> 00:09:29.950
It's very important to understand why.

00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:35.441
The Israeli military has a PTSD rate
of around one percent.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:41.249
The theory is that everyone in Israel
is supposed to serve in the military.

00:09:41.273 --> 00:09:43.383
When soldiers come back
from the front line,

00:09:43.407 --> 00:09:47.845
they're not going from a military
environment to a civilian environment.

00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:52.448
They're coming back to a community
where everyone understands

00:09:53.698 --> 00:09:54.853
about the military.

00:09:54.877 --> 00:09:57.032
Everyone's been in it
or is going to be in it.

00:09:57.056 --> 00:09:59.412
Everyone understands
the situation they're all in.

00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:01.705
It's as if they're all in one big tribe.

00:10:02.282 --> 00:10:04.316
We know that if you take a lab rat

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.012
and traumatize it and put it
in a cage by itself,

00:10:08.036 --> 00:10:11.193
you can maintain its trauma symptoms
almost indefinitely.

00:10:11.717 --> 00:10:16.804
And if you take that same lab rat
and put it in a cage with other rats,

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:21.374
after a couple of weeks,
it's pretty much OK.

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:24.771
After 9/11,

00:10:26.549 --> 00:10:29.842
the murder rate in New York City
went down by 40 percent.

00:10:29.866 --> 00:10:31.688
The suicide rate went down.

00:10:32.756 --> 00:10:37.260
The violent crime rate in New York
went down after 9/11.

00:10:37.284 --> 00:10:42.603
Even combat veterans of previous wars
who suffered from PTSD

00:10:42.627 --> 00:10:47.124
said that their symptoms went down
after 9/11 happened.

00:10:47.148 --> 00:10:50.584
The reason is that if you traumatize
an entire society,

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.669
we don't fall apart
and turn on one another.

00:10:55.693 --> 00:10:57.807
We come together. We unify.

00:10:57.831 --> 00:10:59.878
Basically, we tribalize,

00:10:59.902 --> 00:11:05.455
and that process of unifying
feels so good and is so good for us,

00:11:05.479 --> 00:11:06.896
that it even helps people

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.214
who are struggling
with mental health issues.

00:11:10.238 --> 00:11:12.003
During the blitz in London,

00:11:12.027 --> 00:11:17.040
admissions to psychiatric wards
went down during the bombings.

00:11:18.606 --> 00:11:21.828
For a while, that was the kind of country

00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:25.723
that American soldiers came
back to -- a unified country.

00:11:26.288 --> 00:11:27.559
We were sticking together.

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:30.194
We were trying to understand
the threat against us.

00:11:30.218 --> 00:11:34.297
We were trying to help
ourselves and the world.

00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:37.122
But that's changed.

00:11:38.392 --> 00:11:40.738
Now, American soldiers,

00:11:40.762 --> 00:11:44.582
American veterans are coming back
to a country that is so bitterly divided

00:11:45.716 --> 00:11:49.138
that the two political parties
are literally accusing each other

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.510
of treason, of being
an enemy of the state,

00:11:54.265 --> 00:11:59.025
of trying to undermine the security
and the welfare of their own country.

00:11:59.049 --> 00:12:03.182
The gap between rich and poor
is the biggest it's ever been.

00:12:03.206 --> 00:12:04.391
It's just getting worse.

00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:06.823
Race relations are terrible.

00:12:06.847 --> 00:12:09.703
There are demonstrations
and even riots in the streets

00:12:09.727 --> 00:12:11.706
because of racial injustice.

00:12:12.727 --> 00:12:16.988
And veterans know that any tribe
that treated itself that way -- in fact,

00:12:17.012 --> 00:12:21.942
any platoon that treated itself
that way -- would never survive.

00:12:23.068 --> 00:12:24.959
We've gotten used to it.

00:12:24.983 --> 00:12:28.836
Veterans have gone away
and are coming back

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.301
and seeing their own country
with fresh eyes.

00:12:33.325 --> 00:12:34.982
And they see what's going on.

00:12:35.738 --> 00:12:37.593
This is the country they fought for.

00:12:38.433 --> 00:12:40.111
No wonder they're depressed.

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:41.709
No wonder they're scared.

00:12:43.371 --> 00:12:47.248
Sometimes, we ask ourselves
if we can save the vets.

00:12:48.248 --> 00:12:51.418
I think the real question
is if we can save ourselves.

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:53.595
If we can,

00:12:53.619 --> 00:12:55.593
I think the vets are going to be fine.

00:12:56.697 --> 00:12:59.834
It's time for this country to unite,

00:13:01.818 --> 00:13:06.610
if only to help the men and women
who fought to protect us.

00:13:07.182 --> 00:13:08.413
Thank you very much.

00:13:08.437 --> 00:13:15.103
(Applause)
