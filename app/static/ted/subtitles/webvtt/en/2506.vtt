WEBVTT

00:00:00.776 --> 00:00:03.070
I want to talk about sex for money.

00:00:03.413 --> 00:00:06.183
I'm not like most of the people
you'll have heard speaking

00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:07.515
about prostitution before.

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:10.599
I'm not a police officer
or a social worker.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.837
I'm not an academic,
a journalist or a politician.

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.077
And as you'll probably have
picked up from Maryam's blurb,

00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:18.302
I'm not a nun, either.

00:00:18.326 --> 00:00:19.415
(Laughter)

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.407
Most of those people would tell you
that selling sex is degrading;

00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:25.566
that no one would ever choose to do it;

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.444
that it's dangerous;
women get abused and killed.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.966
In fact, most of those people would say,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.778
"There should be a law against it!"

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:34.965
Maybe that sounds reasonable to you.

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:39.808
It sounded reasonable to me
until the closing months of 2009,

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:43.013
when I was working two dead-end,
minimum-wage jobs.

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.048
Every month my wages would just
replenish my overdraft.

00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:49.627
I was exhausted and my life
was going nowhere.

00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:52.033
Like many others before me,

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:54.450
I decided sex for money
was a better option.

00:00:55.203 --> 00:00:56.441
Now don't get me wrong --

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:58.872
I would have loved
to have won the lottery instead.

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.991
But it wasn't going
to happen anytime soon,

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:02.425
and my rent needed paying.

00:01:02.832 --> 00:01:05.353
So I signed up for my first
shift in a brothel.

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:08.020
In the years that have passed,

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:09.878
I've had a lot of time to think.

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:13.917
I've reconsidered the ideas
I once had about prostitution.

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.846
I've given a lot of thought to consent

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.099
and the nature of work under capitalism.

00:01:18.552 --> 00:01:20.338
I've thought about gender inequality

00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:22.878
and the sexual and reproductive
labor of women.

00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:26.684
I've experienced exploitation
and violence at work.

00:01:27.142 --> 00:01:28.717
I've thought about what's needed

00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:30.971
to protect other sex workers
from these things.

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:33.104
Maybe you've thought about them, too.

00:01:33.128 --> 00:01:34.285
In this talk,

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:36.778
I'll take you through
the four main legal approaches

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:38.786
applied to sex work throughout the world,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.373
and explain why they don't work;

00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:43.555
why prohibiting the sex industry
actually exacerbates every harm

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.489
that sex workers are vulnerable to.

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:50.478
Then I'm going tell you about what we,
as sex workers, actually want.

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:54.541
The first approach
is full criminalization.

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:56.076
Half the world,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.594
including Russia, South Africa
and most of the US,

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.545
regulates sex work by criminalizing
everyone involved.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.697
So that's seller, buyer and third parties.

00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:06.806
Lawmakers in these countries
apparently hope

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.702
that the fear of getting arrested
will deter people from selling sex.

00:02:10.726 --> 00:02:13.278
But if you're forced to choose
between obeying the law

00:02:13.302 --> 00:02:15.286
and feeding yourself or your family,

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.087
you're going to do the work anyway,

00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:18.546
and take the risk.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.487
Criminalization is a trap.

00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:24.585
It's hard to get a conventional job
when you have a criminal record.

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.605
Potential employers won't hire you.

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:28.425
Assuming you still need money,

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.240
you'll stay in the more flexible,
informal economy.

00:02:31.264 --> 00:02:33.776
The law forces you to keep selling sex,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.751
which is the exact opposite
of its intended effect.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:41.544
Being criminalized leaves you exposed
to mistreatment by the state itself.

00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:44.333
In many places you may be coerced
into paying a bribe

00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:46.712
or even into having sex
with a police officer

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:47.925
to avoid arrest.

00:02:48.432 --> 00:02:51.360
Police and prison guards
in Cambodia, for example,

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:53.408
have been documented
subjecting sex workers

00:02:53.432 --> 00:02:55.721
to what can only be described as torture:

00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:56.896
threats at gunpoint,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.712
beatings, electric shocks, rape

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:01.176
and denial of food.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:03.313
Another worrying thing:

00:03:03.337 --> 00:03:07.736
if you're selling sex in places
like Kenya, South Africa or New York,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.456
a police officer can arrest you
if you're caught carrying condoms,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.482
because condoms can legally be used
as evidence that you're selling sex.

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:17.948
Obviously, this increases HIV risk.

00:03:17.972 --> 00:03:20.432
Imagine knowing if you're busted
carrying condoms,

00:03:20.456 --> 00:03:22.310
it'll be used against you.

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:25.336
It's a pretty strong incentive
to leave them at home, right?

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.666
Sex workers working in these places
are forced to make a tough choice

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.451
between risking arrest
or having risky sex.

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:33.364
What would you choose?

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.928
Would you pack condoms to go to work?

00:03:36.447 --> 00:03:37.749
How about if you're worried

00:03:37.773 --> 00:03:40.738
the police officer would rape you
when he got you in the van?

00:03:41.285 --> 00:03:44.808
The second approach to regulating
sex work seen in these countries

00:03:44.832 --> 00:03:46.224
is partial criminalization,

00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:48.800
where the buying and selling
of sex are legal,

00:03:48.824 --> 00:03:50.119
but surrounding activities,

00:03:50.143 --> 00:03:53.355
like brothel-keeping or soliciting
on the street, are banned.

00:03:53.862 --> 00:03:55.022
Laws like these --

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:56.935
we have them in the UK and in France --

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.617
essentially say to us sex workers,

00:03:58.641 --> 00:04:00.459
"Hey, we don't mind you selling sex,

00:04:00.483 --> 00:04:02.570
just make sure it's done
behind closed doors

00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:04.081
and all alone."

00:04:04.105 --> 00:04:05.890
And brothel-keeping, by the way,

00:04:05.914 --> 00:04:08.953
is defined as just two or more
sex workers working together.

00:04:08.977 --> 00:04:11.810
Making that illegal means
that many of us work alone,

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.657
which obviously makes us
vulnerable to violent offenders.

00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:15.911
But we're also vulnerable

00:04:15.935 --> 00:04:18.598
if we choose to break the law
by working together.

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:20.579
A couple of years ago,

00:04:20.603 --> 00:04:23.472
a friend of mine was nervous
after she was attacked at work,

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:27.185
so I said that she could see her clients
from my place for a while.

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:28.431
During that time,

00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:30.387
we had another guy turn nasty.

00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:33.139
I told the guy to leave
or I'd call the police.

00:04:33.163 --> 00:04:35.754
And he looked at the two of us and said,

00:04:35.778 --> 00:04:37.888
"You girls can't call the cops.

00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:40.660
You're working together,
this place is illegal."

00:04:40.684 --> 00:04:41.847
He was right.

00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:44.454
He eventually left
without getting physically violent,

00:04:44.478 --> 00:04:46.702
but the knowledge
that we were breaking the law

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:48.416
empowered that man to threaten us.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.441
He felt confident he'd get away with it.

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:53.744
The prohibition of street prostitution
also causes more harm

00:04:53.768 --> 00:04:54.920
than it prevents.

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:56.936
Firstly, to avoid getting arrested,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.223
street workers take risks
to avoid detection,

00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:00.610
and that means working alone

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.669
or in isolated locations like dark forests

00:05:02.693 --> 00:05:04.745
where they're vulnerable to attack.

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:06.666
If you're caught selling sex outdoors,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.908
you pay a fine.

00:05:08.353 --> 00:05:11.152
How do you pay that fine
without going back to the streets?

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:13.723
It was the need for money
that saw you in the streets

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:14.898
in the first place.

00:05:14.922 --> 00:05:16.445
And so the fines stack up,

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.207
and you're caught in a vicious cycle

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:21.591
of selling sex to pay the fines
you got for selling sex.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.892
Let me tell you about Mariana Popa
who worked in Redbridge, East London.

00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:29.443
The street workers on her patch
would normally wait for clients in groups

00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:30.763
for safety in numbers

00:05:30.787 --> 00:05:33.730
and to warn each other about how
to avoid dangerous guys.

00:05:34.142 --> 00:05:37.810
But during a police crackdown
on sex workers and their clients,

00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:40.814
she was forced to work alone
to avoid being arrested.

00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:45.488
She was stabbed to death
in the early hours of October 29, 2013.

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.814
She had been working later than usual

00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:50.892
to try to pay off a fine
she had received for soliciting.

00:05:51.994 --> 00:05:54.729
So if criminalizing
sex workers hurts them,

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:57.539
why not just criminalize
the people who buy sex?

00:05:57.854 --> 00:05:59.692
This is the aim of the third approach

00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:00.874
I want to talk about --

00:06:00.898 --> 00:06:02.986
the Swedish or Nordic
model of sex-work law.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.237
The idea behind this law

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:06.724
is that selling sex
is intrinsically harmful

00:06:06.748 --> 00:06:10.250
and so you're, in fact, helping
sex workers by removing the option.

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:12.002
Despite growing support

00:06:12.026 --> 00:06:14.708
for what's often described
as the "end demand" approach,

00:06:14.732 --> 00:06:16.375
there's no evidence that it works.

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:19.738
There's just as much prostitution
in Sweden as there was before.

00:06:19.762 --> 00:06:21.178
Why might that be?

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.567
It's because people selling sex

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.707
often don't have other options for income.

00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:26.883
If you need that money,

00:06:26.907 --> 00:06:29.389
the only effect that a drop
in business is going have

00:06:29.413 --> 00:06:31.138
is to force you to lower your prices

00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:33.567
or offer more risky sexual services.

00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:35.164
If you need to find more clients,

00:06:35.188 --> 00:06:36.986
you might seek the help of a manager.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.990
So you see, rather than putting a stop

00:06:39.014 --> 00:06:40.847
to what's often descried as pimping,

00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:42.891
a law like this actually gives oxygen

00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:44.951
to potentially abusive third parties.

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:47.419
To keep safe in my work,

00:06:47.443 --> 00:06:49.336
I try not to take bookings from someone

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.110
who calls me from a withheld number.

00:06:51.134 --> 00:06:53.059
If it's a home or a hotel visit,

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:55.252
I try to get a full name and details.

00:06:55.703 --> 00:06:57.830
If I worked under the Swedish model,

00:06:57.854 --> 00:07:00.552
a client would be too scared
to give me that information.

00:07:00.576 --> 00:07:02.014
I might have no other choice

00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:04.989
but to accept a booking
from a man who is untraceable

00:07:05.013 --> 00:07:06.950
if he later turns out to be violent.

00:07:07.832 --> 00:07:09.047
If you need their money,

00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:11.443
you need to protect
your clients from the police.

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:12.624
If you work outdoors,

00:07:12.648 --> 00:07:15.211
that means working alone
or in isolated locations,

00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:17.450
just as if you were criminalized yourself.

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:20.060
It might mean getting into cars quicker,

00:07:20.084 --> 00:07:22.629
less negotiating time
means snap decisions.

00:07:23.015 --> 00:07:25.643
Is this guy dangerous or just nervous?

00:07:26.142 --> 00:07:27.828
Can you afford to take the risk?

00:07:28.492 --> 00:07:30.138
Can you afford not to?

00:07:31.555 --> 00:07:33.044
Something I'm often hearing is,

00:07:33.068 --> 00:07:34.396
"Prostitution would be fine

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.801
if we made it legal and regulated it."

00:07:36.825 --> 00:07:38.602
We call that approach legalization,

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:41.422
and it's used by countries
like the Netherlands, Germany

00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:43.038
and Nevada in the US.

00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:45.763
But it's not a great
model for human rights.

00:07:45.787 --> 00:07:47.592
And in state-controlled prostitution,

00:07:47.616 --> 00:07:49.179
commercial sex can only happen

00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:51.496
in certain legally-designated
areas or venues,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.510
and sex workers are made to comply
with special restrictions,

00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:57.297
like registration
and forced health checks.

00:07:58.014 --> 00:08:00.163
Regulation sounds great on paper,

00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:03.467
but politicians deliberately make
regulation around the sex industry

00:08:03.491 --> 00:08:06.158
expensive and difficult to comply with.

00:08:06.182 --> 00:08:10.526
It creates a two-tiered system:
legal and illegal work.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.552
We sometimes call it
"backdoor criminalization."

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:16.997
Rich, well-connected brothel owners
can comply with the regulations,

00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:19.194
but more marginalized people
find those hoops

00:08:19.218 --> 00:08:21.172
impossible to jump through.

00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:23.166
And even if it's possible in principle,

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.175
getting a license or proper venue
takes time and costs money.

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:27.678
It's not going to be an option

00:08:27.702 --> 00:08:30.156
for someone who's desperate
and needs money tonight.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.222
They might be a refugee
or fleeing domestic abuse.

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:34.785
In this two-tiered system,

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.046
the most vulnerable people
are forced to work illegally,

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.086
so they're still exposed to all
the dangers of criminalization

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.546
I mentioned earlier.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:43.729
So.

00:08:43.753 --> 00:08:45.835
It's looking like all attempts to control

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.541
or prevent sex work from happening

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:50.296
makes things more dangerous
for people selling sex.

00:08:50.682 --> 00:08:54.108
Fear of law enforcement makes them
work alone in isolated locations,

00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:55.839
and allows clients and even cops

00:08:55.863 --> 00:08:58.632
to get abusive in the knowledge
they'll get away with it.

00:08:58.656 --> 00:09:01.817
Fines and criminal records force
people to keep selling sex,

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:03.819
rather than enabling them to stop.

00:09:04.325 --> 00:09:07.102
Crackdowns on buyers drive sellers
to take dangerous risks

00:09:07.126 --> 00:09:09.463
and into the arms
of potentially abusive managers.

00:09:09.487 --> 00:09:13.254
These laws also reinforce stigma
and hatred against sex workers.

00:09:13.278 --> 00:09:16.627
When France temporarily brought in
the Swedish model two years ago,

00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:18.626
ordinary citizens took it as a cue

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.601
to start carrying out vigilante attacks

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:22.764
against people working on the street.

00:09:22.788 --> 00:09:24.786
In Sweden, opinion surveys show

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.765
that significantly more people want
sex workers to be arrested now

00:09:28.789 --> 00:09:30.736
than before the law was brought in.

00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:33.747
If prohibition is this harmful,

00:09:33.771 --> 00:09:35.953
you might ask, why it so popular?

00:09:36.832 --> 00:09:39.775
Firstly, sex work is and always
has been a survival strategy

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:42.707
for all kinds of unpopular
minority groups:

00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:43.934
people of color,

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.109
migrants,

00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:46.357
people with disabilities,

00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:47.576
LGBTQ people,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.297
particularly trans women.

00:09:49.924 --> 00:09:52.030
These are the groups most heavily profiled

00:09:52.054 --> 00:09:54.380
and punished through prohibitionist law.

00:09:54.404 --> 00:09:56.380
I don't think this is an accident.

00:09:56.404 --> 00:09:58.243
These laws have political support

00:09:58.267 --> 00:10:00.906
precisely because they target people

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.512
that voters don't want
to see or know about.

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:07.076
Why else might people support prohibition?

00:10:07.465 --> 00:10:11.122
Well, lots of people have
understandable fears about trafficking.

00:10:11.664 --> 00:10:15.511
Folks think that foreign women
kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery

00:10:15.535 --> 00:10:18.153
can be saved by shutting
a whole industry down.

00:10:18.555 --> 00:10:20.242
So let's talk about trafficking.

00:10:21.156 --> 00:10:24.739
Forced labor does occur
in many industries,

00:10:24.763 --> 00:10:28.342
especially those where the workers
are migrants or otherwise vulnerable,

00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:30.047
and this needs to be addressed.

00:10:30.535 --> 00:10:34.814
But it's best addressed with legislation
targeting those specific abuses,

00:10:34.838 --> 00:10:36.354
not an entire industry.

00:10:36.791 --> 00:10:39.168
When 23 undocumented Chinese migrants

00:10:39.192 --> 00:10:42.109
drowned while picking cockles
in Morecambe Bay in 2004,

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:45.069
there were no calls to outlaw
the entire seafood industry

00:10:45.093 --> 00:10:47.154
to save trafficking victims.

00:10:47.178 --> 00:10:50.533
The solution is clearly to give
workers more legal protections,

00:10:50.557 --> 00:10:52.326
allowing them to resist abuse

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.390
and report it to authorities
without fear of arrest.

00:10:55.414 --> 00:10:57.714
The way the term trafficking
is thrown around

00:10:57.738 --> 00:11:01.959
implies that all undocumented
migration into prostitution is forced.

00:11:02.423 --> 00:11:05.429
In fact, many migrants
have made a decision,

00:11:05.453 --> 00:11:06.707
out of economic need,

00:11:06.731 --> 00:11:09.514
to place themselves into the hands
of people smugglers.

00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:11.320
Many do this with the full knowledge

00:11:11.344 --> 00:11:14.547
that they'll be selling sex
when they reach their destination.

00:11:14.571 --> 00:11:16.324
And yes, it can often be the case

00:11:16.348 --> 00:11:19.593
that these people smugglers
demand exorbitant fees,

00:11:19.617 --> 00:11:22.521
coerce migrants into work
they don't want to do

00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:24.432
and abuse them when they're vulnerable.

00:11:24.456 --> 00:11:25.959
That's true of prostitution,

00:11:25.983 --> 00:11:27.930
but it's also true of agricultural work,

00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:30.105
hospitality work and domestic work.

00:11:30.653 --> 00:11:34.046
Ultimately, nobody wants
to be forced to do any kind of work,

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.571
but that's a risk many migrants
are willing to take,

00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:38.465
because of what they're leaving behind.

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.449
If people were allowed to migrate legally

00:11:40.473 --> 00:11:44.010
they wouldn't have to place their lives
into the hands of people smugglers.

00:11:44.034 --> 00:11:45.185
The problems arise

00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:47.034
from the criminalization of migration,

00:11:47.058 --> 00:11:49.019
just as they do from the criminalization

00:11:49.043 --> 00:11:50.194
of sex work itself.

00:11:50.218 --> 00:11:51.800
This is a lesson of history.

00:11:51.824 --> 00:11:55.470
If you try to prohibit something
that people want or need to do,

00:11:55.494 --> 00:11:59.069
whether that's drinking alcohol
or crossing borders

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.382
or getting an abortion

00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:01.766
or selling sex,

00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:04.371
you create more problems than you solve.

00:12:04.395 --> 00:12:06.184
Prohibition barely makes a difference

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.638
to the amount of people
actually doing those things.

00:12:08.672 --> 00:12:10.143
But it makes a huge difference

00:12:10.177 --> 00:12:13.096
as to whether or not
they're safe when they do them.

00:12:13.591 --> 00:12:15.890
Why else might people support prohibition?

00:12:16.787 --> 00:12:20.153
As a feminist, I know
that the sex industry is a site

00:12:20.177 --> 00:12:23.057
of deeply entrenched social inequality.

00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:26.133
It's a fact that most buyers of sex
are men with money,

00:12:26.157 --> 00:12:28.448
and most sellers are women without.

00:12:28.472 --> 00:12:30.772
You can agree with all that -- I do --

00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:34.102
and still think prohibition
is a terrible policy.

00:12:34.783 --> 00:12:36.921
In a better, more equal world,

00:12:36.945 --> 00:12:40.573
maybe there would be far fewer
people selling sex to survive,

00:12:40.597 --> 00:12:44.208
but you can't simply legislate
a better world into existence.

00:12:44.232 --> 00:12:46.718
If someone needs to sell sex
because they're poor

00:12:46.742 --> 00:12:48.184
or because they're homeless

00:12:48.208 --> 00:12:51.350
or because they're undocumented
and they can't find legal work,

00:12:51.374 --> 00:12:54.929
taking away that option
doesn't make them any less poor

00:12:54.953 --> 00:12:56.576
or house them

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.553
or change their immigration status.

00:12:58.577 --> 00:13:01.108
People worry that selling
sex is degrading.

00:13:01.634 --> 00:13:04.313
Ask yourself: is it more degrading
than going hungry

00:13:04.926 --> 00:13:06.853
or seeing your children go hungry?

00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:10.370
There's no call to ban rich people
from hiring nannies

00:13:10.394 --> 00:13:11.647
or getting manicures,

00:13:11.671 --> 00:13:15.297
even though most of the people
doing that labor are poor, migrant women.

00:13:15.321 --> 00:13:19.465
It's the fact of poor migrant women
selling sex specifically

00:13:19.489 --> 00:13:21.794
that has some feminists uncomfortable.

00:13:22.481 --> 00:13:23.634
And I can understand

00:13:23.658 --> 00:13:26.383
why the sex industry provokes
strong feelings.

00:13:26.407 --> 00:13:29.430
People have all kinds
of complicated feelings

00:13:29.454 --> 00:13:30.913
when it comes to sex.

00:13:31.546 --> 00:13:34.791
But we can't make policy
on the basis of mere feelings,

00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:36.877
especially not over
the heads of the people

00:13:36.901 --> 00:13:38.639
actually effected by those policies.

00:13:38.663 --> 00:13:41.282
If we get fixated on
the abolition of sex work,

00:13:41.306 --> 00:13:43.970
we end up worrying more
about a particular manifestation

00:13:43.994 --> 00:13:45.407
of gender inequality,

00:13:45.431 --> 00:13:47.753
rather than about the underlying causes.

00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:50.764
People get really hung up on the question,

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:53.256
"Well, would you want
your daughter doing it?"

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.790
That's the wrong question.

00:13:55.217 --> 00:13:57.885
Instead, imagine she is doing it.

00:13:58.542 --> 00:14:00.406
How safe is she at work tonight?

00:14:01.155 --> 00:14:02.684
Why isn't she safer?

00:14:04.497 --> 00:14:07.418
So we've looked at full criminalization,

00:14:07.442 --> 00:14:10.445
partial criminalization,
the Swedish or Nordic Model

00:14:10.469 --> 00:14:11.659
and legalization,

00:14:11.683 --> 00:14:13.335
and how they all cause harm.

00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:16.311
Something I never hear asked is:

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:18.509
"What do sex workers want?"

00:14:19.573 --> 00:14:22.241
After all, we're the ones
most affected by these laws.

00:14:23.115 --> 00:14:25.995
New Zealand decriminalized
sex work in 2003.

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.433
It's crucial to remember

00:14:28.457 --> 00:14:31.908
that decriminalization and legalization
are not the same thing.

00:14:31.932 --> 00:14:34.817
Decriminalization means
the removal of laws

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:36.884
that punitively target the sex industry,

00:14:36.908 --> 00:14:40.330
instead treating sex work
much like any other kind of work.

00:14:40.354 --> 00:14:43.167
In New Zealand, people
can work together for safety,

00:14:43.191 --> 00:14:45.944
and employers of sex workers
are accountable to the state.

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:48.651
A sex worker can refuse
to see a client at any time,

00:14:48.675 --> 00:14:50.135
for any reason,

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:52.633
and 96 percent of street workers

00:14:52.657 --> 00:14:55.798
report that they feel the law
protects their rights.

00:14:55.822 --> 00:14:57.916
New Zealand hasn't actually
seen an increase

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.051
in the amount of people doing sex work,

00:15:00.075 --> 00:15:02.699
but decriminalizing it
has made it a lot safer.

00:15:03.274 --> 00:15:04.851
But the lesson from New Zealand

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:07.272
isn't just that its particular
legislation is good,

00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:08.447
but that crucially,

00:15:08.471 --> 00:15:10.790
it was written in collaboration
with sex workers;

00:15:10.814 --> 00:15:13.123
namely, the New Zealand
Prostitutes' Collective.

00:15:13.147 --> 00:15:15.476
When it came to making sex work safer,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.689
they were ready to hear it straight
from sex workers themselves.

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:20.401
Here in the UK,

00:15:20.425 --> 00:15:23.843
I'm part of sex worker-led groups
like the Sex Worker Open University

00:15:23.867 --> 00:15:25.962
and the English Collective of Prostitutes.

00:15:25.986 --> 00:15:27.781
And we form part of a global movement

00:15:27.805 --> 00:15:31.265
demanding decriminalization
and self-determination.

00:15:31.653 --> 00:15:34.393
The universal symbol of our movement
is the red umbrella.

00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:37.518
We're supported in our demands
by global bodies like UNAIDS,

00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:39.142
the World Health Organization

00:15:39.166 --> 00:15:40.552
and Amnesty International.

00:15:40.924 --> 00:15:42.762
But we need more allies.

00:15:43.181 --> 00:15:45.517
If you care about gender equality

00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:48.337
or poverty or migration or public health,

00:15:48.361 --> 00:15:50.865
then sex worker rights matter to you.

00:15:51.355 --> 00:15:53.378
Make space for us in your movements.

00:15:53.402 --> 00:15:56.638
That means not only listening
to sex workers when we speak

00:15:56.662 --> 00:15:58.663
but amplifying our voices.

00:15:59.219 --> 00:16:01.340
Resist those who silence us,

00:16:01.364 --> 00:16:04.543
those who say that a prostitute
is either too victimized,

00:16:04.567 --> 00:16:07.213
too damaged to know
what's best for herself,

00:16:07.237 --> 00:16:08.973
or else too privileged

00:16:08.997 --> 00:16:11.185
and too removed from real hardship,

00:16:11.209 --> 00:16:14.589
not representative of the millions
of voiceless victims.

00:16:15.709 --> 00:16:20.512
This distinction between victim
and empowered is imaginary.

00:16:20.536 --> 00:16:22.989
It exists purely to discredit sex workers

00:16:23.013 --> 00:16:24.956
and make it easy to ignore us.

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:28.011
No doubt many of you work for a living.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.281
Well, sex work is work, too.

00:16:30.877 --> 00:16:32.033
Just like you,

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.663
some of us like our jobs,

00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:35.088
some of us hate them.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.413
Ultimately, most of us
have mixed feelings.

00:16:39.238 --> 00:16:41.644
But how we feel about our work

00:16:42.566 --> 00:16:43.740
isn't the point.

00:16:44.484 --> 00:16:47.502
And how others feel
about our work certainly isn't.

00:16:48.373 --> 00:16:51.121
What's important is that we have
the right to work safely

00:16:51.145 --> 00:16:52.453
and on our own terms.

00:16:52.477 --> 00:16:54.352
Sex workers are real people.

00:16:54.823 --> 00:16:57.003
We've had complicated experiences

00:16:57.655 --> 00:17:00.710
and complicated responses
to those experiences.

00:17:01.651 --> 00:17:04.427
But our demands are not complicated.

00:17:04.451 --> 00:17:07.248
You can ask expensive
escorts in New York City,

00:17:07.272 --> 00:17:10.210
brothel workers in Cambodia,
street workers in South Africa

00:17:10.234 --> 00:17:13.353
and every girl on the roster
at my old job in Soho,

00:17:13.377 --> 00:17:15.717
and they will all tell you the same thing.

00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:17.982
You can speak to millions of sex workers

00:17:18.006 --> 00:17:20.463
and countless sex work-led organizations.

00:17:20.487 --> 00:17:24.457
We want full decriminalization
and labor rights as workers.

00:17:24.985 --> 00:17:27.301
I'm just one sex worker
on the stage today,

00:17:27.325 --> 00:17:29.895
but I'm bringing a message
from all over the world.

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:31.087
Thank you.

00:17:31.111 --> 00:17:37.484
(Applause)
