00:00:00.488 --> 00:00:02.738
So this is James Risen.

00:00:03.174 --> 00:00:05.924
You may know him as the
Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter

00:00:05.948 --> 00:00:07.640
for The New York Times.

00:00:07.664 --> 00:00:10.418
Long before anybody knew
Edward Snowden's name,

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:13.358
Risen wrote a book in which
he famously exposed

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:17.318
that the NSA was illegally wiretapping
the phone calls of Americans.

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:19.612
But it's another chapter in that book

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:21.651
that may have an even more lasting impact.

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:27.223
In it, he describes a catastrophic
US intelligence operation

00:00:27.247 --> 00:00:30.336
in which the CIA quite literally
handed over blueprints

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.146
of a nuclear bomb to Iran.

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:34.457
If that sounds crazy, go read it.

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:35.972
It's an incredible story.

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:38.520
But you know who didn't like that chapter?

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:40.043
The US government.

00:00:40.592 --> 00:00:42.806
For nearly a decade afterwards,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.083
Risen was the subject
of a US government investigation

00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:48.476
in which prosecutors demanded
that he testify

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.404
against one of his alleged sources.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.904
And along the way, he became the face
for the US government's recent pattern

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:57.947
of prosecuting whistleblowers
and spying on journalists.

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:00.349
You see, under the First Amendment,

00:01:00.373 --> 00:01:04.000
the press has the right to publish
secret information in the public interest.

00:01:04.024 --> 00:01:09.158
But it's impossible to exercise that right
if the media can't also gather that news

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:12.438
and protect the identities
of the brave men and women

00:01:12.462 --> 00:01:13.612
who get it to them.

00:01:14.087 --> 00:01:16.119
So when the government came knocking,

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:19.184
Risen did what many brave reporters
have done before him:

00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:20.393
he refused

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:22.088
and said he'd rather go to jail.

00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:25.594
So from 2007 to 2015,

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.412
Risen lived under the specter
of going to federal prison.

00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:33.023
That is, until just days before the trial,
when a curious thing happened.

00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:37.713
Suddenly, after years of claiming
it was vital to their case,

00:01:37.737 --> 00:01:40.427
the government dropped their demands
to Risen altogether.

00:01:40.912 --> 00:01:43.460
It turns out, in the age
of electronic surveillance,

00:01:43.484 --> 00:01:46.372
there are very few places
reporters and sources can hide.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.554
And instead of trying and failing
to have Risen testify,

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:53.625
they could have his digital trail
testify against him instead.

00:01:54.585 --> 00:01:57.101
So completely in secret
and without his consent,

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:59.395
prosecutors got Risen's phone records.

00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:04.419
They got his email records,
his financial and banking information,

00:02:04.443 --> 00:02:06.196
his credit reports,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.990
even travel records with a list
of flights he had taken.

00:02:09.808 --> 00:02:13.593
And it was among this information that
they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling,

00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:16.736
Risen's alleged source
and CIA whistleblower.

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:20.450
Sadly, this is only one case of many.

00:02:21.152 --> 00:02:24.759
President Obama ran on a promise
to protect whistleblowers,

00:02:24.783 --> 00:02:28.045
and instead, his Justice Department
has prosecuted more

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.560
than all other administrations combined.

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:33.283
Now, you can see how this
could be a problem,

00:02:33.307 --> 00:02:37.774
especially because the government
considers so much of what it does secret.

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:43.258
Since 9/11, virtually every important
story about national security

00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:46.202
has been the result of a whistleblower
coming to a journalist.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.568
So we risk seeing the press
unable to do their job

00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:51.791
that the First Amendment
is supposed to protect

00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:54.822
because of the government's
expanded ability to spy on everyone.

00:02:55.487 --> 00:02:57.940
But just as technology has allowed
the government

00:02:57.964 --> 00:03:00.671
to circumvent reporters' rights,

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:02.869
the press can also use technology

00:03:02.893 --> 00:03:05.233
to protect their sources
even better than before.

00:03:05.698 --> 00:03:08.810
And they can start from the moment
they begin speaking with them,

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:11.261
rather than on the witness stand
after the fact.

00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:14.289
Communications software now exists

00:03:14.313 --> 00:03:16.845
that wasn't available
when Risen was writing his book,

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:20.868
and is much more surveillance-resistant
than regular emails or phone calls.

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:26.007
For example, one such tool is SecureDrop,

00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:28.716
an open-source whistleblower
submission system

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.788
that was originally created by the late
Internet luminary Aaron Swartz,

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:35.477
and is now developed
at the non-profit where I work,

00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.032
Freedom of the Press Foundation.

00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:39.476
Instead of sending an email,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.541
you go to a news organization's website,

00:03:41.565 --> 00:03:43.565
like this one here on The Washington Post.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.953
From there, you can upload a document
or send information

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.406
much like you would
on any other contact form.

00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:53.334
It'll then be encrypted
and stored on a server

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.906
that only the news organization
has access to.

00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:59.724
So the government can no longer
secretly demand the information,

00:03:59.748 --> 00:04:01.852
and much of the information
they would demand

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:03.835
wouldn't be available in the first place.

00:04:04.475 --> 00:04:07.439
SecureDrop, though, is really
only a small part of the puzzle

00:04:07.463 --> 00:04:10.410
for protecting press freedom
in the 21st century.

00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:13.408
Unfortunately, governments
all over the world

00:04:13.432 --> 00:04:15.932
are constantly developing
new spying techniques

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:17.360
that put us all at risk.

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:20.741
And it's up to us going forward
to make sure

00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:23.265
that it's not just
the tech-savvy whistleblowers,

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.574
like Edward Snowden, who have
an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.

00:04:27.408 --> 00:04:32.155
It's just as vital that we protect the
next veteran's health care whistleblower

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:35.487
alerting us to overcrowded hospitals,

00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:37.838
or the next environmental worker

00:04:37.862 --> 00:04:41.060
sounding the alarm
about Flint's dirty water,

00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:42.764
or a Wall Street insider

00:04:42.788 --> 00:04:44.965
warning us of the next financial crisis.

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:49.997
After all, these tools weren't just built
to help the brave men and women

00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:51.559
who expose crimes,

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.817
but are meant to protect
all of our rights under the Constitution.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.611
Thank you.

00:04:56.635 --> 00:04:59.944
(Applause)
