00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:04.572
So I know TED is about a lot
of things that are big,

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:08.126
but I want to talk to you
about something very small.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.308
So small, it's a single word.

00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:12.649
The word is "misfit."

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:16.966
It's one of my favorite words,
because it's so literal.

00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:21.349
I mean, it's a person
who sort of missed fitting in.

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:24.048
Or a person who fits in badly.

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:27.581
Or this: "a person who is poorly adapted

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:30.473
to new situations and environments."

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:33.520
I'm a card-carrying misfit.

00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:37.140
And I'm here for the other
misfits in the room,

00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:38.975
because I'm never the only one.

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:41.880
I'm going to tell you a misfit story.

00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:45.769
Somewhere in my early 30s,

00:00:45.793 --> 00:00:49.355
the dream of becoming a writer
came right to my doorstep.

00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:51.802
Actually, it came to my mailbox

00:00:51.826 --> 00:00:55.485
in the form of a letter that said
I'd won a giant literary prize

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:57.434
for a short story I had written.

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.944
The short story was about my life
as a competitive swimmer

00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:04.687
and about my crappy home life,

00:01:05.258 --> 00:01:10.155
and a little bit about how grief
and loss can make you insane.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.502
The prize was a trip to New York City
to meet big-time editors and agents

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:17.850
and other authors.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:21.342
So kind of it was the wannabe
writer's dream, right?

00:01:22.573 --> 00:01:25.413
You know what I did the day
the letter came to my house?

00:01:26.037 --> 00:01:27.835
Because I'm me,

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.056
I put the letter on my kitchen table,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.522
I poured myself a giant glass of vodka

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:36.292
with ice and lime,

00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:40.926
and I sat there in my underwear
for an entire day,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.032
just staring at the letter.

00:01:44.608 --> 00:01:47.753
I was thinking about all the ways
I'd already screwed my life up.

00:01:47.777 --> 00:01:50.951
Who the hell was I to go to New York City

00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:52.705
and pretend to be a writer?

00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:55.046
Who was I?

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.268
I'll tell you.

00:01:56.745 --> 00:01:57.912
I was a misfit.

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.988
Like legions of other children,

00:02:01.908 --> 00:02:04.276
I came from an abusive household

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.956
that I narrowly escaped with my life.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:12.218
I already had two epically
failed marriages underneath my belt.

00:02:12.242 --> 00:02:15.208
I'd flunked out of college
not once but twice

00:02:15.232 --> 00:02:18.424
and maybe even a third time
that I'm not going to tell you about.

00:02:18.448 --> 00:02:20.258
(Laughter)

00:02:20.582 --> 00:02:24.243
And I'd done an episode
of rehab for drug use.

00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:29.245
And I'd had two lovely
staycations in jail.

00:02:30.228 --> 00:02:32.132
So I'm on the right stage.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.770
(Laughter)

00:02:36.744 --> 00:02:40.237
But the real reason,
I think, I was a misfit,

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:43.523
is that my daughter died
the day she was born,

00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:46.666
and I hadn't figured out
how to live with that story yet.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:53.360
After my daughter died
I also spent a long time homeless,

00:02:53.384 --> 00:02:55.328
living under an overpass

00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:59.570
in a kind of profound state
of zombie grief and loss

00:02:59.594 --> 00:03:02.108
that some of us encounter along the way.

00:03:02.132 --> 00:03:04.863
Maybe all of us, if you live long enough.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.237
You know, homeless people
are some of our most heroic misfits,

00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:13.357
because they start out as us.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.088
So you see, I'd missed fitting in
to just about every category out there:

00:03:20.112 --> 00:03:24.580
daughter, wife, mother, scholar.

00:03:25.474 --> 00:03:27.973
And the dream of being a writer

00:03:27.997 --> 00:03:33.438
was really kind of like a small,
sad stone in my throat.

00:03:34.906 --> 00:03:38.375
It was pretty much in spite of myself
that I got on that plane

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:40.786
and flew to New York City,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.366
where the writers are.

00:03:43.168 --> 00:03:46.843
Fellow misfits, I can almost
see your heads glowing.

00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:48.779
I can pick you out of a room.

00:03:48.803 --> 00:03:51.241
At first, you would've loved it.

00:03:51.265 --> 00:03:54.217
You got to choose the three
famous writers you wanted to meet,

00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:56.599
and these guys went
and found them for you.

00:03:56.623 --> 00:03:59.413
You got set up at the Gramercy Park Hotel,

00:03:59.437 --> 00:04:02.071
where you got to drink Scotch
late in the night

00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:04.586
with cool, smart, swank people.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.119
And you got to pretend you were cool
and smart and swank, too.

00:04:09.143 --> 00:04:12.331
And you got to meet a bunch
of editors and authors and agents

00:04:12.355 --> 00:04:16.418
at very, very fancy lunches and dinners.

00:04:17.377 --> 00:04:19.005
Ask me how fancy.

00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:21.696
Audience: How fancy?

00:04:22.077 --> 00:04:26.395
Lidia Yuknavitch: I'm making a confession:
I stole three linen napkins --

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.990
(Laughter)

00:04:28.014 --> 00:04:29.671
from three different restaurants.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.696
And I shoved a menu down my pants.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.796
(Laughter)

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.526
I just wanted some keepsakes
so that when I got home,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.835
I could believe it had really
happened to me.

00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:42.470
You know?

00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:45.131
The three writers I wanted to meet

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:47.964
were Carole Maso, Lynne Tillman
and Peggy Phelan.

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.550
These were not famous,
best-selling authors,

00:04:51.574 --> 00:04:54.881
but to me, they were women-writer titans.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.262
Carole Maso wrote the book
that later became my art bible.

00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:02.557
Lynne Tillman gave me
permission to believe

00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:06.062
that there was a chance
my stories could be part of the world.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.793
And Peggy Phelan reminded me

00:05:08.817 --> 00:05:13.826
that maybe my brains
could be more important than my boobs.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.184
They weren't mainstream women writers,

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:21.985
but they were cutting a path
through the mainstream

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.342
with their body stories,

00:05:24.294 --> 00:05:28.429
I like to think, kind of the way
water cut the Grand Canyon.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.082
It nearly killed me with joy

00:05:31.106 --> 00:05:34.947
to hang out with these three
over-50-year-old women writers.

00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:37.897
And the reason it nearly
killed me with joy

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.990
is that I'd never known a joy like that.

00:05:40.014 --> 00:05:41.696
I'd never been in a room like that.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.108
My mother never went to college.

00:05:44.747 --> 00:05:47.236
And my creative career to that point

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.712
was a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing.

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:56.673
So kind of in those first nights
in New York I wanted to die there.

00:05:56.697 --> 00:06:00.137
I was just like, "Kill me now.
I'm good. This is beautiful."

00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:04.335
Some of you in the room
will understand what happened next.

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:09.230
First, they took me to the offices
of Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

00:06:09.863 --> 00:06:13.038
Farrar, Straus and Giroux
was like my mega-dream press.

00:06:13.062 --> 00:06:16.753
I mean, T.S. Eliot and Flannery O'Connor
were published there.

00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:21.793
The main editor guy sat me down
and talked to me for a long time,

00:06:21.817 --> 00:06:24.135
trying to convince me I had a book in me

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:25.864
about my life as a swimmer.

00:06:26.498 --> 00:06:27.785
You know, like a memoir.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.866
The whole time he was talking to me,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.595
I sat there smiling and nodding
like a numb idiot,

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.361
with my arms crossed over my chest,

00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:42.302
while nothing, nothing, nothing
came out of my throat.

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:47.242
So in the end, he patted me
on the shoulder

00:06:47.266 --> 00:06:48.847
like a swim coach might.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.415
And he wished me luck

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:53.877
and he gave me some free books

00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:55.692
and he showed me out the door.

00:06:57.588 --> 00:07:00.855
Next, they took me
to the offices of W.W. Norton,

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.579
where I was pretty sure
I'd be escorted from the building

00:07:03.603 --> 00:07:05.492
just for wearing Doc Martens.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.639
But that didn't happen.

00:07:08.512 --> 00:07:10.941
Being at the Norton offices

00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:15.437
felt like reaching up into the night sky
and touching the moon

00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:19.098
while the stars stitched your name
across the cosmos.

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.744
I mean, that's how big
a deal it was to me.

00:07:21.768 --> 00:07:22.949
You get it?

00:07:23.567 --> 00:07:26.065
Their lead editor, Carol Houck Smith,

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:30.432
leaned over right in my face
with these beady, bright, fierce eyes

00:07:30.456 --> 00:07:33.566
and said, "Well, send me
something then, immediately!"

00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:36.620
See, now most people,
especially TED people,

00:07:36.644 --> 00:07:38.984
would have run to the mailbox, right?

00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:42.929
It took me over a decade to even imagine

00:07:42.953 --> 00:07:46.830
putting something in an envelope
and licking a stamp.

00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:50.315
On the last night,

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:53.608
I gave a big reading
at the National Poetry Club.

00:07:54.342 --> 00:07:56.289
And at the end of the reading,

00:07:56.313 --> 00:08:00.616
Katharine Kidde of Kidde,
Hoyt &amp; Picard Literary Agency,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.227
walked straight up to me and shook my hand

00:08:03.251 --> 00:08:06.429
and offered me representation,
like, on the spot.

00:08:08.558 --> 00:08:11.545
I stood there and I kind of went deaf.

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:13.155
Has this ever happened to you?

00:08:13.703 --> 00:08:15.815
And I almost started crying

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:19.764
because all the people in the room
were dressed so beautifully,

00:08:19.788 --> 00:08:22.941
and all that came out of my mouth was:

00:08:22.965 --> 00:08:26.075
"I don't know. I have to think about it."

00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:31.097
And she said, "OK, then," and walked away.

00:08:32.884 --> 00:08:39.403
All those open hands out to me,
that small, sad stone in my throat ...

00:08:39.427 --> 00:08:43.365
You see, I'm trying to tell you something
about people like me.

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:47.442
Misfit people -- we don't always know
how to hope or say yes

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:49.077
or choose the big thing,

00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:51.247
even when it's right in front of us.

00:08:51.271 --> 00:08:52.890
It's a shame we carry.

00:08:52.914 --> 00:08:54.905
It's the shame of wanting something good.

00:08:54.929 --> 00:08:56.921
It's the shame of feeling something good.

00:08:56.945 --> 00:09:01.327
It's the shame of not really believing
we deserve to be in the room

00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:03.468
with the people we admire.

00:09:04.472 --> 00:09:07.398
If I could, I'd go back
and I'd coach myself.

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:11.765
I'd be exactly like those
over-50-year-old women who helped me.

00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:13.690
I'd teach myself how to want things,

00:09:13.714 --> 00:09:16.054
how to stand up, how to ask for them.

00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:20.384
I'd say, "You! Yeah, you!
You belong in the room, too."

00:09:20.408 --> 00:09:22.680
The radiance falls on all of us,

00:09:22.704 --> 00:09:25.615
and we are nothing without each other.

00:09:27.041 --> 00:09:30.313
Instead, I flew back to Oregon,

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:36.029
and as I watched the evergreens
and rain come back into view,

00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:40.345
I just drank many tiny bottles
of airplane "feel sorry for yourself."

00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:46.333
I thought about how, if I was a writer,
I was some kind of misfit writer.

00:09:47.244 --> 00:09:48.403
What I'm saying is,

00:09:48.427 --> 00:09:50.431
I flew back to Oregon without a book deal,

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:51.606
without an agent,

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.115
and with only a headful
and heart-ful of memories

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:57.287
of having sat so near

00:09:57.311 --> 00:09:59.581
the beautiful writers.

00:10:00.278 --> 00:10:03.684
Memory was the only prize
I allowed myself.

00:10:05.175 --> 00:10:08.304
And yet, at home in the dark,

00:10:09.272 --> 00:10:10.835
back in my underwear,

00:10:11.788 --> 00:10:13.518
I could still hear their voices.

00:10:14.264 --> 00:10:18.305
They said, "Don't listen to anyone
who tries to get you to shut up

00:10:18.329 --> 00:10:19.880
or change your story."

00:10:20.861 --> 00:10:24.540
They said, "Give voice to the story
only you know how to tell."

00:10:24.564 --> 00:10:26.994
They said, "Sometimes telling the story

00:10:27.018 --> 00:10:30.064
is the thing that saves your life."

00:10:31.703 --> 00:10:35.393
Now I am, as you can see,
the woman over 50.

00:10:36.278 --> 00:10:37.453
And I'm a writer.

00:10:38.516 --> 00:10:39.743
And I'm a mother.

00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:41.978
And I became a teacher.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.851
Guess who my favorite students are.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.232
Although it didn't happen the day

00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:50.510
that dream letter came through my mailbox,

00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:52.207
I did write a memoir,

00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:54.064
called "The Chronology of Water."

00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:59.588
In it are the stories of how many times
I've had to reinvent a self

00:10:59.612 --> 00:11:02.016
from the ruins of my choices,

00:11:02.575 --> 00:11:07.985
the stories of how my seeming failures
were really just weird-ass portals

00:11:08.009 --> 00:11:09.531
to something beautiful.

00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:13.761
All I had to do
was give voice to the story.

00:11:15.552 --> 00:11:19.798
There's a myth in most cultures
about following your dreams.

00:11:20.664 --> 00:11:22.385
It's called the hero's journey.

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:25.503
But I prefer a different myth,

00:11:25.527 --> 00:11:27.306
that's slightly to the side of that

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.487
or underneath it.

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:30.941
It's called the misfit's myth.

00:11:31.763 --> 00:11:33.028
And it goes like this:

00:11:33.623 --> 00:11:35.878
even at the moment of your failure,

00:11:35.902 --> 00:11:38.480
right then, you are beautiful.

00:11:39.585 --> 00:11:40.737
You don't know it yet,

00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:43.938
but you have the ability
to reinvent yourself

00:11:43.962 --> 00:11:45.160
endlessly.

00:11:45.184 --> 00:11:46.778
That's your beauty.

00:11:47.694 --> 00:11:49.210
You can be a drunk,

00:11:49.234 --> 00:11:51.583
you can be a survivor of abuse,

00:11:51.607 --> 00:11:53.043
you can be an ex-con,

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:54.565
you can be a homeless person,

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:57.867
you can lose all your money
or your job or your husband

00:11:57.891 --> 00:12:00.305
or your wife, or the worst thing of all,

00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:01.479
a child.

00:12:01.864 --> 00:12:03.917
You can even lose your marbles.

00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:08.010
You can be standing dead center
in the middle of your failure

00:12:08.034 --> 00:12:10.912
and still, I'm only here to tell you,

00:12:10.936 --> 00:12:13.049
you are so beautiful.

00:12:13.073 --> 00:12:15.372
Your story deserves to be heard,

00:12:15.396 --> 00:12:19.669
because you, you rare
and phenomenal misfit,

00:12:19.693 --> 00:12:21.949
you new species,

00:12:22.568 --> 00:12:24.537
are the only one in the room

00:12:24.561 --> 00:12:26.177
who can tell the story

00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:28.609
the way only you would.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.220
And I'd be listening.

00:12:32.863 --> 00:12:34.039
Thank you.

00:12:34.063 --> 00:12:45.423
(Applause)
