00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the year 1919,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
a virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
suggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
He proposed that our universe

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
might actually have more than the three dimensions

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that we are all aware of.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that for some reason we don't yet see.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
sometimes that's all it is -- bold and bizarre,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but it has nothing to do with the world around us.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This particular idea, however --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
may tell us whether it's right or wrong --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So where do we go?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
To begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to 1907.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of having discovered the special theory of relativity

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and decides to take on a new project,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to try to understand fully the grand, pervasive force of gravity.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And in that moment, there are many people around

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
who thought that that project had already been resolved.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that works well, describes the motion of planets,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the motion of the moon and so forth,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
hitting people on the head.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
All of that could be described using Newton's work.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
because even Newton had written

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
he'd been unable to figure out how it really works.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
How is it that the Sun, 93 million miles away,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And that is a task to which Einstein set himself --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
to figure out how gravity works.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And let me show you what it is that he found.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So Einstein found

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The idea goes like this:

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
imagine space is a substrate of all there is.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Einstein said space is nice and flat, if there's no matter present.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
But if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
it causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And that communicates the force of gravity.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Even the Earth warps space around it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now look at the Moon.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The Moon is kept in orbit, according to these ideas,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We go to a full-frame view of this.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The Earth itself is kept in orbit

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
because of the Sun's presence.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Now, this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It really works. It describes the data.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And this gained Einstein prominence around the world.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And that is what got Kaluza thinking.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
He, like Einstein, was in search of what we call a unified theory.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
That's one theory

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
one set of principles, one master equation, if you will.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So Kaluza said to himself,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Einstein has been able to describe gravity

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
in terms of warps and curves in space --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
in fact, space and time, to be more precise.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
which was, at that time, known as the electromagnetic force --

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
we know of others today, but at that time

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that was the only other one people were thinking about.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You know, the force responsible for electricity

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and magnetic attraction and so forth.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So Kaluza says, maybe I can play the same game

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
That raised a question: warps and curves in what?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Einstein had already used up space and time,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
warps and curves, to describe gravity.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So Kaluza said, well, maybe there are more dimensions of space.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
He said, if I want to describe one more force,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
maybe I need one more dimension.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, not three,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
in that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing:

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
in a universe with four space dimensions, not three,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
those were for gravity --

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And when he looked at that equation,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
it was none other than the equation

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Amazing -- it just popped out.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
He was so excited by this realization

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that he ran around his house screaming, "Victory!" --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
that he had found the unified theory.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Now clearly, Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
He, in fact --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
he read a book, a treatise on swimming --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
(Laughter)

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
-- then dove into the ocean.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
This is a man who would risk his life on theory.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Now, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
two questions immediately arise from his observation.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Number one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We don't seem to see them.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And number two: does this theory really work in detail,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
when you try to apply it to the world around us?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Now, the first question was answered in 1926

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
by a fellow named Oskar Klein.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
there might be big, easy-to-see dimensions,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
but there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
curled up so small, even though they're all around us,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
that we don't see them.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Let me show you that one visually.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So, imagine you're looking at something

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
like a cable supporting a traffic light.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park -- it's kind of irrelevant --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
but you and I all know that it does have some thickness.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It's very hard to see it, though, from far away.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
But if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
a little ant walking around --

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
the long dimension,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
but also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And I hope you appreciate this.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It took so long to get these ants to do this.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
(Laughter)

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts:

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
big and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
are the ones that we can easily see,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
but there might be additional dimensions curled up,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
sort of like the circular part of that cable,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
so small that they have so far remained invisible.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Let me show you what that would look like.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So, if we take a look, say, at space itself --

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Some of you guys will fix that one day,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
goes smaller, smaller, smaller,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
this is the idea,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
you could have additional curled up dimensions --

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don't see them.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about --

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
that's like the grid part --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
or even with any of our most refined equipment.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
the idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Now that's an explanation

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But what about the second question that I asked:

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
does the theory actually work

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
when you try to apply it to the real world?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Well, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
worked on trying to refine this framework

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and apply it to the physics of the universe

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
In detail, for instance,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
they couldn't get the mass of the electron

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
to work out correctly in this theory.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
this strange but very compelling idea

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Until something wonderful happened in our age.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
In our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
is being pursued by physicists such as myself,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
many others around the world,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
it's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
but when we study superstring theory,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So, let me just tell you how that goes.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Superstring theory -- what is it?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Well, it's a theory that tries to answer the question:

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
what are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
making up everything in the world around us?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The idea is like this.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So, imagine we look at a familiar object, just a candle in a holder,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
So deep inside -- we all know, you go sufficiently far down, you have atoms.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
with neutrons and protons.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
That is where conventional ideas stop.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Here is the new idea of string theory.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Deep inside any of these particles, there is something else.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
This something else is this dancing filament of energy.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
It looks like a vibrating string --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
that's where the idea, string theory comes from.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
can vibrate in different patterns,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
these can also vibrate in different patterns.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
They don't produce different musical notes.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Rather, they produce the different particles making up the world around us.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So if these ideas are correct,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
It's built up of a huge number

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
vibrating in different frequencies.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
The different frequencies produce the different particles.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
The different particles are responsible

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
for all the richness in the world around us.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And there you see unification,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
because matter particles, electrons and quarks,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
radiation particles, photons, gravitons, are all built up from one entity.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So matter and the forces of nature all are put together

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
under the rubric of vibrating strings.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And that's what we mean by a unified theory.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Now here is the catch.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
When you study the mathematics of string theory,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
you find that it doesn't work

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
in a universe that just has three dimensions of space.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Finally, you can study the equations, and show that it works

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and one dimension of time.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
that our world, when appropriately described,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
has more dimensions than the ones that we see.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Now you might think about that and say, well,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
OK, you know, if you have extra dimensions, and they're really tightly curled up,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
yeah, perhaps we won't see them, if they're small enough.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and you make them small enough, and we won't see them either. That is true.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
One of the other predictions of string theory --

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
no, that's not one of the other predictions of string theory.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Laughter)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
But it raises the question:

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
or do they tell us something about the world?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
In the remaining time, I'd like to tell you two features of them.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
First is, many of us believe that these extra dimensions

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
in theoretical physics, theoretical science.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And that question is this: when we look around the world,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
as scientists have done for the last hundred years,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
These are numbers like the mass of the particles,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
like electrons and quarks, the strength of gravity,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
the strength of the electromagnetic force --

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
a list of about 20 numbers

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
that have been measured with incredible precision,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
but nobody has an explanation

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
for why the numbers have the particular values that they do.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Now, does string theory offer an answer?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Not yet.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
may rely on the form of the extra dimensions.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And the wonderful thing is, if those numbers

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
had any other values than the known ones,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
the universe, as we know it, wouldn't exist.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
This is a deep question.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Why are those numbers so finely tuned

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to allow stars to shine and planets to form,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
if I had 20 dials up here

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So can we explain those 20 numbers?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And string theory suggests that those 20 numbers

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
have to do with the extra dimensions.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Let me show you how.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
it's not one extra dimension,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
They have a very rich, intertwined geometry.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
name isn't all that important.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
But, as you can see,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
the extra dimensions fold in on themselves

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
would look like this on the tiniest of scales.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
When you swing your hand,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
but they're so small that we wouldn't know it.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So what is the physical implication, though, relevant to those 20 numbers?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Consider this. If you look at the instrument, a French horn,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
notice that the vibrations of the airstreams

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
are affected by the shape of the instrument.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Now in string theory,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
So just as those airstreams

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
strings themselves will be affected

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So let me bring some strings into the story.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around --

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
they'll be there in a second -- right there,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
notice that they way they vibrate is affected

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
by the geometry of the extra dimensions.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
So, if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like --

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
we don't yet, but if we did --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
we should be able to calculate the allowed notes,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
the allowed vibrational patterns.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And if the answer that we get from our calculations

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
agrees with the values of those numbers

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
that have been determined

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
through detailed and precise experimentation,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
for why the structure of the universe is the way it is.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Now, the second issue that I want to finish up with is:

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Is this just an interesting mathematical structure

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
that might be able to explain

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
some previously unexplained features of the world,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
or can we actually test for these extra dimensions?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And we think -- and this is, I think, very exciting --

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that in the next five years or so we may be able to test

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
for the existence of these extra dimensions.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Here's how it goes. In CERN, Geneva, Switzerland,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
opposite directions, near the speed of light.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
so there's a head-on collision.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
The hope is that if the collision has enough energy,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
it may eject some of the debris from the collision

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
from our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
How would we know it?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Well, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
compare it to the amount of energy before,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
and if there's less energy after the collision than before,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Let me show you that idea visually.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
So, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton --

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
if the extra dimensions are real.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
But here's how the experiment will go.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
You take these particles. You slam them together.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
You slam them together, and if we are right,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
some of the energy of that collision

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
So this is the kind of experiment

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
that we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And if this experiment bears fruit,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
if we see that kind of particle ejected

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
than when we began,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
this will show that the extra dimensions are real.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And to me this is a really remarkable story,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
and a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space --

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
didn't provide anything but an arena, a stage

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
in which the events of the universe take place.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Einstein comes along and says,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
well, space and time can warp and curve -- that's what gravity is.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And now string theory comes along and says,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
yes, gravity, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
all together in one package,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Amazing possibility.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000
(Applause)
