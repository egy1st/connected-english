00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:06.156
We have historical records that allow us
to know how the ancient Greeks dressed,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.434
how they lived,

00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:08.980
how they fought ...

00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:10.528
but how did they think?

00:00:11.432 --> 00:00:15.872
One natural idea is that the deepest
aspects of human thought --

00:00:15.896 --> 00:00:17.768
our ability to imagine,

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:19.189
to be conscious,

00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:20.444
to dream --

00:00:20.468 --> 00:00:22.087
have always been the same.

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:24.371
Another possibility

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:28.118
is that the social transformations
that have shaped our culture

00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:31.927
may have also changed
the structural columns of human thought.

00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:35.435
We may all have different
opinions about this.

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:38.176
Actually, it's a long-standing
philosophical debate.

00:00:38.644 --> 00:00:41.371
But is this question
even amenable to science?

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.340
Here I'd like to propose

00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:50.136
that in the same way we can reconstruct
how the ancient Greek cities looked

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.548
just based on a few bricks,

00:00:52.572 --> 00:00:56.698
that the writings of a culture
are the archaeological records,

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.865
the fossils, of human thought.

00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:01.079
And in fact,

00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:03.309
doing some form of psychological analysis

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.877
of some of the most ancient
books of human culture,

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:12.856
Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s
with a very wild and radical hypothesis:

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.293
that only 3,000 years ago,

00:01:15.317 --> 00:01:20.205
humans were what today
we would call schizophrenics.

00:01:21.753 --> 00:01:23.261
And he made this claim

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:26.586
based on the fact that the first
humans described in these books

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.514
behaved consistently,

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:31.554
in different traditions
and in different places of the world,

00:01:31.578 --> 00:01:35.110
as if they were hearing and obeying voices

00:01:35.134 --> 00:01:38.174
that they perceived
as coming from the Gods,

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.396
or from the muses ...

00:01:40.063 --> 00:01:42.832
what today we would call hallucinations.

00:01:43.888 --> 00:01:46.514
And only then, as time went on,

00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:50.189
they began to recognize
that they were the creators,

00:01:50.213 --> 00:01:52.728
the owners of these inner voices.

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:56.031
And with this, they gained introspection:

00:01:56.055 --> 00:01:58.538
the ability to think
about their own thoughts.

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:03.182
So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness,

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:06.372
at least in the way we perceive it today,

00:02:06.396 --> 00:02:09.936
where we feel that we are the pilots
of our own existence --

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.697
is a quite recent cultural development.

00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:15.242
And this theory is quite spectacular,

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:16.699
but it has an obvious problem

00:02:16.723 --> 00:02:20.715
which is that it's built on just a few
and very specific examples.

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:22.848
So the question is whether the theory

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:27.623
that introspection built up in human
history only about 3,000 years ago

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.631
can be examined in a quantitative
and objective manner.

00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:35.106
And the problem of how
to go about this is quite obvious.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.590
It's not like Plato woke up one day
and then he wrote,

00:02:38.614 --> 00:02:40.273
"Hello, I'm Plato,

00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:43.186
and as of today, I have
a fully introspective consciousness."

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.503
(Laughter)

00:02:45.527 --> 00:02:48.860
And this tells us actually
what is the essence of the problem.

00:02:49.467 --> 00:02:53.522
We need to find the emergence
of a concept that's never said.

00:02:54.434 --> 00:02:58.744
The word introspection
does not appear a single time

00:02:58.768 --> 00:03:00.687
in the books we want to analyze.

00:03:01.728 --> 00:03:05.815
So our way to solve this
is to build the space of words.

00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:09.858
This is a huge space
that contains all words

00:03:09.882 --> 00:03:12.684
in such a way that the distance
between any two of them

00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:15.591
is indicative of how
closely related they are.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.611
So for instance,

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:20.532
you want the words "dog" and "cat"
to be very close together,

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:24.387
but the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm"
to be very far away.

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:28.705
And this has to be true
for any two words within the space.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.967
And there are different ways
that we can construct the space of words.

00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:34.634
One is just asking the experts,

00:03:34.658 --> 00:03:36.554
a bit like we do with dictionaries.

00:03:36.896 --> 00:03:38.324
Another possibility

00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:42.063
is following the simple assumption
that when two words are related,

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:44.436
they tend to appear in the same sentences,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.913
in the same paragraphs,

00:03:45.937 --> 00:03:47.707
in the same documents,

00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:50.913
more often than would be expected
just by pure chance.

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.281
And this simple hypothesis,

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:55.611
this simple method,

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.242
with some computational tricks

00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:58.655
that have to do with the fact

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.743
that this is a very complex
and high-dimensional space,

00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:03.432
turns out to be quite effective.

00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:06.957
And just to give you a flavor
of how well this works,

00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:10.893
this is the result we get when
we analyze this for some familiar words.

00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:12.792
And you can see first

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:16.094
that words automatically organize
into semantic neighborhoods.

00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:18.335
So you get the fruits, the body parts,

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.784
the computer parts,
the scientific terms and so on.

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:25.341
The algorithm also identifies
that we organize concepts in a hierarchy.

00:04:25.852 --> 00:04:27.003
So for instance,

00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:30.624
you can see that the scientific terms
break down into two subcategories

00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:32.748
of the astronomic and the physics terms.

00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:35.584
And then there are very fine things.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.513
For instance, the word astronomy,

00:04:37.537 --> 00:04:39.352
which seems a bit bizarre where it is,

00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:41.424
is actually exactly where it should be,

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.043
between what it is,

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:44.337
an actual science,

00:04:44.361 --> 00:04:45.897
and between what it describes,

00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:47.413
the astronomical terms.

00:04:48.182 --> 00:04:50.073
And we could go on and on with this.

00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:52.157
Actually, if you stare
at this for a while,

00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:54.039
and you just build random trajectories,

00:04:54.063 --> 00:04:57.229
you will see that it actually feels
a bit like doing poetry.

00:04:58.018 --> 00:04:59.900
And this is because, in a way,

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.864
walking in this space
is like walking in the mind.

00:05:04.027 --> 00:05:05.644
And the last thing

00:05:05.668 --> 00:05:09.708
is that this algorithm also identifies
what are our intuitions,

00:05:09.732 --> 00:05:13.628
of which words should lead
in the neighborhood of introspection.

00:05:13.652 --> 00:05:14.875
So for instance,

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:18.878
words such as "self," "guilt,"
"reason," "emotion,"

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.791
are very close to "introspection,"

00:05:20.815 --> 00:05:21.966
but other words,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.157
such as "red," "football,"
"candle," "banana,"

00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:25.633
are just very far away.

00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:28.816
And so once we've built the space,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.666
the question of the history
of introspection,

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.023
or of the history of any concept

00:05:34.047 --> 00:05:38.826
which before could seem abstract
and somehow vague,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.454
becomes concrete --

00:05:40.478 --> 00:05:43.216
becomes amenable to quantitative science.

00:05:44.216 --> 00:05:46.978
All that we have to do is take the books,

00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:48.383
we digitize them,

00:05:48.407 --> 00:05:51.216
and we take this stream
of words as a trajectory

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.209
and project them into the space,

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:56.987
and then we ask whether this trajectory
spends significant time

00:05:57.011 --> 00:06:00.003
circling closely to the concept
of introspection.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.956
And with this,

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.092
we could analyze
the history of introspection

00:06:04.116 --> 00:06:06.037
in the ancient Greek tradition,

00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:08.663
for which we have the best
available written record.

00:06:09.631 --> 00:06:11.886
So what we did is we took all the books --

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.194
we just ordered them by time --

00:06:14.218 --> 00:06:15.970
for each book we take the words

00:06:15.994 --> 00:06:17.955
and we project them to the space,

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.011
and then we ask for each word
how close it is to introspection,

00:06:21.035 --> 00:06:22.265
and we just average that.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.788
And then we ask whether,
as time goes on and on,

00:06:25.812 --> 00:06:29.064
these books get closer,
and closer and closer

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:30.842
to the concept of introspection.

00:06:30.866 --> 00:06:34.667
And this is exactly what happens
in the ancient Greek tradition.

00:06:35.698 --> 00:06:38.825
So you can see that for the oldest books
in the Homeric tradition,

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.261
there is a small increase with books
getting closer to introspection.

00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:44.491
But about four centuries before Christ,

00:06:44.515 --> 00:06:49.223
this starts ramping up very rapidly
to an almost five-fold increase

00:06:49.247 --> 00:06:51.747
of books getting closer,
and closer and closer

00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:53.453
to the concept of introspection.

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.583
And one of the nice things about this

00:06:56.607 --> 00:06:57.805
is that now we can ask

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:01.976
whether this is also true
in a different, independent tradition.

00:07:02.962 --> 00:07:06.138
So we just ran this same analysis
on the Judeo-Christian tradition,

00:07:06.162 --> 00:07:08.883
and we got virtually the same pattern.

00:07:09.548 --> 00:07:14.183
Again, you see a small increase
for the oldest books in the Old Testament,

00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:16.121
and then it increases much more rapidly

00:07:16.145 --> 00:07:17.984
in the new books of the New Testament.

00:07:18.008 --> 00:07:20.040
And then we get the peak of introspection

00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:22.191
in "The Confessions of Saint Augustine,"

00:07:22.215 --> 00:07:24.072
about four centuries after Christ.

00:07:24.897 --> 00:07:26.841
And this was very important,

00:07:26.865 --> 00:07:30.238
because Saint Augustine
had been recognized by scholars,

00:07:30.262 --> 00:07:32.434
philologists, historians,

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:34.536
as one of the founders of introspection.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.357
Actually, some believe him to be
the father of modern psychology.

00:07:39.012 --> 00:07:40.851
So our algorithm,

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:43.717
which has the virtue
of being quantitative,

00:07:43.741 --> 00:07:45.004
of being objective,

00:07:45.028 --> 00:07:47.044
and of course of being extremely fast --

00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:49.465
it just runs in a fraction of a second --

00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:52.992
can capture some of the most
important conclusions

00:07:53.016 --> 00:07:55.238
of this long tradition of investigation.

00:07:56.317 --> 00:07:59.968
And this is in a way
one of the beauties of science,

00:07:59.992 --> 00:08:03.468
which is that now this idea
can be translated

00:08:03.492 --> 00:08:06.063
and generalized to a whole lot
of different domains.

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:11.536
So in the same way that we asked
about the past of human consciousness,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.966
maybe the most challenging question
we can pose to ourselves

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.127
is whether this can tell us something
about the future of our own consciousness.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.020
To put it more precisely,

00:08:21.044 --> 00:08:23.460
whether the words we say today

00:08:23.484 --> 00:08:28.681
can tell us something
of where our minds will be in a few days,

00:08:28.705 --> 00:08:29.856
in a few months

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.062
or a few years from now.

00:08:31.597 --> 00:08:34.617
And in the same way many of us
are now wearing sensors

00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:36.427
that detect our heart rate,

00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:37.720
our respiration,

00:08:37.744 --> 00:08:39.411
our genes,

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:43.086
on the hopes that this may
help us prevent diseases,

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.631
we can ask whether monitoring
and analyzing the words we speak,

00:08:46.655 --> 00:08:49.338
we tweet, we email, we write,

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:54.170
can tell us ahead of time whether
something may go wrong with our minds.

00:08:55.087 --> 00:08:56.621
And with Guillermo Cecchi,

00:08:56.645 --> 00:08:59.646
who has been my brother in this adventure,

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.225
we took on this task.

00:09:02.228 --> 00:09:07.760
And we did so by analyzing
the recorded speech of 34 young people

00:09:07.784 --> 00:09:10.585
who were at a high risk
of developing schizophrenia.

00:09:11.434 --> 00:09:14.315
And so what we did is,
we measured speech at day one,

00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:17.581
and then we asked whether the properties
of the speech could predict,

00:09:17.605 --> 00:09:20.101
within a window of almost three years,

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:22.160
the future development of psychosis.

00:09:23.427 --> 00:09:25.793
But despite our hopes,

00:09:25.817 --> 00:09:28.934
we got failure after failure.

00:09:29.793 --> 00:09:33.675
There was just not enough
information in semantics

00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:36.492
to predict the future
organization of the mind.

00:09:36.516 --> 00:09:38.325
It was good enough

00:09:38.349 --> 00:09:42.524
to distinguish between a group
of schizophrenics and a control group,

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:45.260
a bit like we had done
for the ancient texts,

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:48.278
but not to predict the future
onset of psychosis.

00:09:49.164 --> 00:09:50.870
But then we realized

00:09:50.894 --> 00:09:54.982
that maybe the most important thing
was not so much what they were saying,

00:09:55.006 --> 00:09:56.679
but how they were saying it.

00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:58.899
More specifically,

00:09:58.923 --> 00:10:01.750
it was not in which semantic
neighborhoods the words were,

00:10:01.774 --> 00:10:04.374
but how far and fast they jumped

00:10:04.398 --> 00:10:06.699
from one semantic neighborhood
to the other one.

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:08.978
And so we came up with this measure,

00:10:09.002 --> 00:10:11.391
which we termed semantic coherence,

00:10:11.415 --> 00:10:16.219
which essentially measures the persistence
of speech within one semantic topic,

00:10:16.243 --> 00:10:17.772
within one semantic category.

00:10:19.294 --> 00:10:23.341
And it turned out to be
that for this group of 34 people,

00:10:23.365 --> 00:10:27.024
the algorithm based on semantic
coherence could predict,

00:10:27.048 --> 00:10:29.548
with 100 percent accuracy,

00:10:29.572 --> 00:10:32.079
who developed psychosis and who will not.

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:35.913
And this was something
that could not be achieved --

00:10:35.937 --> 00:10:37.445
not even close --

00:10:37.469 --> 00:10:40.595
with all the other
existing clinical measures.

00:10:42.525 --> 00:10:46.104
And I remember vividly,
while I was working on this,

00:10:46.128 --> 00:10:48.445
I was sitting at my computer

00:10:48.469 --> 00:10:51.104
and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo --

00:10:51.128 --> 00:10:54.295
Polo had been my first student
back in Buenos Aires,

00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:56.389
and at the time
he was living in New York.

00:10:56.413 --> 00:10:58.501
And there was something in this tweets --

00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:02.026
I could not tell exactly what
because nothing was said explicitly --

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.071
but I got this strong hunch,

00:11:04.095 --> 00:11:07.050
this strong intuition,
that something was going wrong.

00:11:08.347 --> 00:11:11.070
So I picked up the phone,
and I called Polo,

00:11:11.094 --> 00:11:13.013
and in fact he was not feeling well.

00:11:13.362 --> 00:11:15.299
And this simple fact,

00:11:15.323 --> 00:11:17.814
that reading in between the lines,

00:11:17.838 --> 00:11:22.100
I could sense,
through words, his feelings,

00:11:22.124 --> 00:11:24.743
was a simple, but very
effective way to help.

00:11:25.987 --> 00:11:27.625
What I tell you today

00:11:27.649 --> 00:11:30.157
is that we're getting
close to understanding

00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:34.467
how we can convert this intuition
that we all have,

00:11:34.491 --> 00:11:35.856
that we all share,

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.077
into an algorithm.

00:11:38.102 --> 00:11:39.563
And in doing so,

00:11:39.587 --> 00:11:44.237
we may be seeing in the future
a very different form of mental health,

00:11:44.261 --> 00:11:49.882
based on objective, quantitative
and automated analysis

00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:51.615
of the words we write,

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:53.176
of the words we say.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.351
Gracias.

00:11:54.375 --> 00:12:01.258
