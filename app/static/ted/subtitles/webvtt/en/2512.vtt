00:00:02.585 --> 00:00:03.976
What do you see?

00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:08.768
Most of you see a barbershop,

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:11.680
but I see an opportunity:

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:14.429
an opportunity for health,

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:16.778
an opportunity for health equity.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:21.802
For black men, the barbershop
is not just a place

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:24.548
where you get your hair cut
or your beard trimmed.

00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:27.342
No, it's much more than that.

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:32.196
Historically, the barbershop
has been a safe haven for black men.

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:36.570
It's a place where we go for friendship,

00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:38.935
solidarity and solace.

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:43.687
It's a place where we go
to get away from the stress

00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:46.958
of the grind of work

00:00:46.982 --> 00:00:48.672
and sometimes home life.

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:52.202
It's a place where we don't have to worry

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:54.709
about how we're being perceived
by the outside world.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:59.542
It's a place where we don't
feel threatened,

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.907
or threatening.

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:05.312
It's a place of loyalty and trust.

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:08.478
For that reason,

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:12.401
it's one of the few places
where we can fearlessly be ourselves

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:15.058
and just ... talk.

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.534
The talk, the shop talk, the conversation,

00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:22.199
that is the essence
of the black barbershop.

00:01:23.178 --> 00:01:26.056
I can remember going to the barbershop
with my dad as a kid.

00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:30.562
We went to Mr. Mike's barbershop
every other Saturday.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.197
And like clockwork,
the same group of men would be there

00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.942
every time we went,

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:39.323
either waiting on their favorite barber

00:01:39.347 --> 00:01:41.990
or just soaking up the atmosphere.

00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:47.169
I can remember the jovial greeting
that warmly welcomed us

00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:48.614
every time we went.

00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:52.860
"Hey Rev," they would say to my dad.

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:56.670
He's a local pastor,
and they treated him like a celebrity.

00:01:57.923 --> 00:02:00.242
"Hey young fella, how you doing?"

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.718
they would say to me,

00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:03.837
making me feel just as special.

00:02:05.118 --> 00:02:09.380
I remember the range
of the conversations was immense.

00:02:10.173 --> 00:02:14.396
The men would talk about politics
and sports and music

00:02:15.205 --> 00:02:18.752
and world news, national news,

00:02:18.776 --> 00:02:20.117
neighborhood news.

00:02:21.064 --> 00:02:22.736
There was some talk about women

00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:27.014
and what it was like to be
a black man in America.

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:31.013
But many times they also
talked about health.

00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:35.949
The conversations about health
were lengthy and deep.

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:40.584
The men often recounted
their doctor's recommendations

00:02:40.608 --> 00:02:42.699
to cut salt in their diet

00:02:42.723 --> 00:02:45.444
or to eat less fried foods

00:02:45.468 --> 00:02:47.689
or to stop smoking

00:02:47.713 --> 00:02:49.222
or to reduce stress.

00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:53.332
They talked about the different ways
you could reduce stress,

00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:55.611
like simplifying one's love life --

00:02:56.378 --> 00:03:00.842
(Laughter)

00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:04.219
all ways to treat high blood pressure.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:08.821
There's a lot of talk about
high blood pressure in the barbershop.

00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:14.608
That's because almost 40 percent
of black men have it.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.133
That means that almost
every single black man

00:03:20.157 --> 00:03:22.099
either has high blood pressure

00:03:22.123 --> 00:03:24.083
or knows a black man who has it.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.187
Sometimes, those conversations
in the barbershop

00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:31.850
would be about what happens
when high blood pressure

00:03:31.874 --> 00:03:33.500
is not adequately addressed.

00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:39.088
"Say, did you hear about Jimmy?
He had a stroke."

00:03:41.612 --> 00:03:45.867
"Did you hear about Eddie?
He died last week.

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:47.579
Massive heart attack.

00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:48.795
He was 50."

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:54.503
More black men die from high blood
pressure than from anything else,

00:03:54.527 --> 00:03:59.422
even though decades of medical wisdom
and science have demonstrated

00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:02.590
that death from high blood pressure
can be prevented

00:04:02.614 --> 00:04:05.969
with timely diagnosis
and appropriate treatment.

00:04:07.132 --> 00:04:10.985
So why is high blood pressure
so differentially deadly for black men?

00:04:12.457 --> 00:04:16.367
Because too often, high blood pressure
is either untreated

00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:19.032
or under-treated in black men,

00:04:19.056 --> 00:04:23.194
in part because of our lower engagement
with the primary healthcare system.

00:04:24.558 --> 00:04:28.339
Black men, in particular
those with high blood pressure,

00:04:28.363 --> 00:04:30.467
are less likely to have
a primary care doctor

00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:31.641
than other groups.

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:33.410
But why?

00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:37.481
Some of our earliest research
on black men's health

00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:42.119
revealed that for many, the doctor's
office is associated with fear,

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.015
mistrust,

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.060
disrespect,

00:04:47.084 --> 00:04:49.266
and unnecessary unpleasantness.

00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:55.327
The doctor's office is only a place
that you go when you don't feel well.

00:04:55.902 --> 00:04:59.192
And when you do go,
you might wait for hours

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:01.565
only to get the run-around

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:06.160
and to be evaluated by
a stoic figure in a white coat

00:05:06.184 --> 00:05:08.811
who only has 10 minutes to give you

00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:11.700
and who doesn't value the talk.

00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:16.683
So it's no wonder that some men
don't want to be bothered

00:05:16.707 --> 00:05:20.003
and skip going to the doctor altogether,

00:05:20.027 --> 00:05:22.159
especially if they feel fine.

00:05:23.402 --> 00:05:25.341
But herein lies the problem.

00:05:26.328 --> 00:05:28.449
You can feel just fine

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:32.296
while high blood pressure ravages
your most vital organs.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.501
This is Denny Moe,

00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:41.183
owner of Denny Moe's
Superstar Barbershop in Harlem.

00:05:41.738 --> 00:05:45.437
I've been lucky enough to have Denny
as my barber for the last eight years.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.221
He said to me once,

00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:50.294
"Hey Doc, you know,

00:05:50.318 --> 00:05:54.714
lots of black men trust their barbers
more than they trust their doctors."

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.937
This was stunning to me,

00:05:57.961 --> 00:05:59.126
at first,

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:01.689
but not so much when you think about it.

00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:05.587
Black men have been with their
current barbers

00:06:05.611 --> 00:06:07.612
on average as long
as I've been with Denny,

00:06:07.636 --> 00:06:08.864
about eight years.

00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:13.825
And black men see their barbers
about every two weeks.

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:19.444
Not only do you trust your barber
with your look and with your style,

00:06:19.468 --> 00:06:23.374
but you also trust him with your secrets
and sometimes your life.

00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:28.819
Denny, like many barbers,
is more than just an artist,

00:06:28.843 --> 00:06:31.049
a businessman and confidant.

00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:36.874
He's a leader and a passionate advocate
for the well-being of his community.

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:41.947
The very first time I walked
into Denny Moe's shop,

00:06:41.971 --> 00:06:43.453
he wasn't just cutting hair.

00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:48.198
He was also orchestrating
a voter registration drive

00:06:48.222 --> 00:06:52.119
to give a voice to his customers
and his community.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.111
With this kind of activism,

00:06:57.206 --> 00:07:01.443
and community investment
that typifies the black barbershop,

00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:05.015
of course the barbershop
is a perfect place

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:08.952
to talk about high blood pressure and
other health concerns in the community.

00:07:09.944 --> 00:07:14.094
First, the barbershop is not
a medical setting,

00:07:14.118 --> 00:07:17.363
and so it doesn't have
all the negative psychological baggage

00:07:17.387 --> 00:07:18.777
that comes along with that.

00:07:19.428 --> 00:07:21.483
When you're in a barbershop,

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:24.936
you're in your territory,
and you're among friends

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.222
who share your history,

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:30.659
your struggle and your health risks.

00:07:31.308 --> 00:07:35.369
Second, because the barbershop
is a place of connection,

00:07:35.393 --> 00:07:37.895
loyalty and trust,

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.428
it's a place where you're more open
to have a conversation about health

00:07:41.452 --> 00:07:43.475
and especially about high blood pressure.

00:07:44.165 --> 00:07:45.635
After all,

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:49.873
conversations about high blood pressure
have all the elements of great shop talk:

00:07:51.017 --> 00:07:53.618
stress and high blood pressure,

00:07:53.642 --> 00:07:56.172
food and high blood pressure,

00:07:56.196 --> 00:07:58.833
relationships and high blood pressure,

00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:02.792
and yes, what it's like
to be a black man in America

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.046
and high blood pressure.

00:08:05.846 --> 00:08:08.918
But you can do more than just talk
about high blood pressure

00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:10.181
in the barbershop.

00:08:10.675 --> 00:08:12.784
You can concretely take action.

00:08:13.915 --> 00:08:18.673
Here we have an opportunity to partner
with the Denny Moe's of the world

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:22.975
and empower communities
to address the health inequities

00:08:22.999 --> 00:08:24.304
that uniquely affect it.

00:08:25.364 --> 00:08:28.824
When high blood pressure screening
expanded from clinics and hospitals

00:08:28.848 --> 00:08:31.975
to communities in the 1960s and '70s,

00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:35.356
black physicians like
Dr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.865
and Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans

00:08:37.889 --> 00:08:41.964
were at the forefront of bringing
health promotion to community hubs

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:43.476
in urban black neighborhoods.

00:08:44.409 --> 00:08:48.549
These pioneers paved the way
for my professional journey

00:08:48.573 --> 00:08:50.556
with barbershops and health,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.865
which began in Chicago in medical school.

00:08:55.372 --> 00:08:58.854
The very first research project
that I worked on as a medical student

00:08:58.878 --> 00:09:01.378
was to help design
healthcare interventions

00:09:01.402 --> 00:09:03.675
that would appeal to black men.

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:07.727
We conducted about a dozen focus groups

00:09:07.751 --> 00:09:11.026
with a broad cross-section of black men,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.164
and we learned that for them,

00:09:13.188 --> 00:09:17.571
being healthy was as much about
being perceived as healthy

00:09:17.595 --> 00:09:19.843
as it was about feeling healthy,

00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:24.120
and that feeling good
went hand in hand with looking good.

00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:29.858
This work led to the development
of Project Brotherhood,

00:09:29.882 --> 00:09:32.787
a community clinic founded
by Dr. Eric Whitaker

00:09:32.811 --> 00:09:35.604
that provided tailored
healthcare to black men.

00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:38.723
Part of this tailored care

00:09:38.747 --> 00:09:41.548
involved having a barber on the premises

00:09:41.572 --> 00:09:45.175
to reward the men who came
for needed healthcare

00:09:45.199 --> 00:09:47.164
with a free haircut,

00:09:47.188 --> 00:09:51.134
to let the men know that we, too,
valued how they looked

00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:53.028
as well as how they felt,

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:57.234
and that what was important to them
was also important to us.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.548
But while there's only one
Project Brotherhood,

00:10:01.572 --> 00:10:04.893
there are thousands of black barbershops

00:10:04.917 --> 00:10:09.393
where the intersection of health
and haircuts can be cultivated.

00:10:10.782 --> 00:10:14.154
The next stop on my journey
was Dallas, Texas,

00:10:14.178 --> 00:10:17.195
where we learned that barbers
were not only willing

00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:21.258
but fully able to roll up
their sleeves and participate

00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:26.806
in delivering needed health services
to improve the health of their customers

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.084
and their community.

00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:32.389
We teamed up with an amazing
cadre of black barbers

00:10:32.413 --> 00:10:34.557
and taught them how
to measure blood pressure

00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:36.362
and how to counsel their customers

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:38.213
and refer them to doctors

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:40.081
to help manage high blood pressure.

00:10:40.977 --> 00:10:43.239
The barbers were not only willing to do it

00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:44.731
but they were damn good at it.

00:10:45.794 --> 00:10:47.748
Over a three-year period,

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:50.716
the barbers measured
thousands of blood pressures

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.541
resulting in hundreds of black men
being referred to doctors

00:10:55.565 --> 00:10:58.645
for medical care
of their high blood pressure.

00:10:59.232 --> 00:11:02.144
These barber-doctor partnerships

00:11:02.168 --> 00:11:06.652
resulted in a 20 percent increase
in the number of men

00:11:06.676 --> 00:11:09.469
who were able to achieve
target blood pressure levels

00:11:09.493 --> 00:11:11.953
and a three-point drop, on average,

00:11:11.977 --> 00:11:13.977
in the blood pressure of each participant.

00:11:14.421 --> 00:11:17.389
If we were to extrapolate
that three point drop

00:11:17.413 --> 00:11:20.818
to every single black man
with high blood pressure in America,

00:11:20.842 --> 00:11:27.089
we would prevent 800 heart attacks,
500 strokes and 900 deaths

00:11:27.113 --> 00:11:28.971
from high blood pressure

00:11:28.995 --> 00:11:30.897
in just one year.

00:11:32.802 --> 00:11:37.024
And our experience with barbershops
has been no different in New York City,

00:11:37.048 --> 00:11:38.897
where my journey has currently led me.

00:11:39.722 --> 00:11:43.666
With an incredible team
of diverse research assistants,

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.816
community health workers and volunteers,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.241
we've been able to partner
with over 200 barbershops

00:11:50.265 --> 00:11:52.749
and other trusted community venues

00:11:52.773 --> 00:11:56.034
to reach over 7,000 older black men.

00:11:56.564 --> 00:11:59.477
And we've offered high blood pressure
screening and counseling

00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.937
to each and every one of them.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.495
Thanks to Denny Moe

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:07.122
and the myriad other barbers
and community leaders

00:12:07.146 --> 00:12:12.090
who shared the vision of opportunity
and empowerment

00:12:12.114 --> 00:12:14.820
to make a difference in their communities,

00:12:14.844 --> 00:12:17.599
we've been able to not only
lower blood pressure

00:12:17.623 --> 00:12:19.083
in our participants,

00:12:19.107 --> 00:12:22.819
but we've also been able to impact
other health indicators.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.622
So what do you see?

00:12:29.532 --> 00:12:31.202
What is your barbershop?

00:12:33.694 --> 00:12:36.543
Where is that place for you

00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:40.503
where people who are affected
by a unique problem

00:12:41.123 --> 00:12:42.908
can meet a unique solution?

00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:49.682
When you find that place,
see the opportunity.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.754
Thank you.

00:12:51.778 --> 00:12:55.222
(Applause)
