WEBVTT

00:00:01.227 --> 00:00:03.275
I was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company,

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:04.450
81's platoon,

00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:06.479
out in Camp Pendleton, California.

00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:07.655
Oorah!

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:08.831
Audience: Oorah!

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:09.856
(Laughter)

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.848
I joined a few months after September 11,

00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:14.891
feeling like I think most people
in the country did at the time,

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:18.200
filled with a sense
of patriotism and retribution

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:19.866
and the desire to do something --

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.635
that, coupled with that fact
that I wasn't doing anything.

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:25.905
I was 17, just graduated
from high school that past summer,

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.631
living in the back room
of my parents' house paying rent,

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:31.244
in the small town I was raised in
in Northern Indiana,

00:00:31.268 --> 00:00:32.426
called Mishawaka.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.028
I can spell that later
for people who are interested --

00:00:35.052 --> 00:00:36.056
(Laughter)

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.940
Mishawaka is many good things
but cultural hub of the world it is not,

00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:41.860
so my only exposure to theater and film

00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:44.013
was limited to the plays
I did in high school

00:00:44.037 --> 00:00:46.265
and Blockbuster Video,
may she rest in peace.

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.461
(Laughter)

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:49.132
I was serious enough about acting

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:52.464
that I auditioned for Juilliard
when I was a senior in high school,

00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:53.639
didn't get in,

00:00:53.663 --> 00:00:56.389
determined college wasn't for me
and applied nowhere else,

00:00:56.413 --> 00:00:57.706
which was a genius move.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.181
I also did that Hail Mary
LA acting odyssey

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:02.840
that I always heard stories about,

00:01:02.864 --> 00:01:05.165
of actors moving to LA
with, like, seven dollars

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.132
and finding work and successful careers.

00:01:07.156 --> 00:01:10.512
I got as far as Amarillo, Texas,
before my car broke down.

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:12.263
I spent all my money repairing it,

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:13.932
finally made it to Santa Monica --

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:15.234
not even LA --

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:17.917
stayed for 48 hours wandering
the beach, basically,

00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:19.227
got in my car, drove home,

00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:20.957
thus ending my acting career, so --

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:22.259
(Laughter)

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:24.171
Seventeen, Mishawaka ...

00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:28.023
parents' house, paying rent,
selling vacuums ...

00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:29.602
telemarketing,

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:31.809
cutting grass at the local
4-H fairgrounds.

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:34.125
This was my world
going into September, 2001.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.300
So after the 11th,

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:37.526
and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.901
and just being pissed off
in general -- at myself,

00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:41.321
my parents, the government;

00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:43.798
not having confidence,
not having a respectable job,

00:01:43.822 --> 00:01:46.924
my shitty mini-fridge that I just
drove to California and back --

00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:49.921
I joined the Marine Corps and loved it.
I loved being a Marine.

00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:52.983
It's one of the things I'm most proud
of having done in my life.

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:54.173
Firing weapons was cool,

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.632
driving and detonating
expensive things was great.

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:58.764
But I found I loved
the Marine Corps the most

00:01:58.788 --> 00:02:01.429
for the thing I was looking
for the least when I joined,

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:02.614
which was the people:

00:02:02.638 --> 00:02:06.218
these weird dudes --
a motley crew of characters

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:08.624
from a cross section
of the United States --

00:02:08.648 --> 00:02:10.979
that on the surface I had
nothing in common with.

00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:12.611
And over time,

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:14.461
all the political and personal bravado

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:16.362
that led me to the military dissolved,

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.368
and for me, the Marine Corps
became synonymous with my friends.

00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:21.680
And then, a few years into my service

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:23.783
and months away from deploying to Iraq,

00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:26.672
I dislocated my sternum
in a mountain-biking accident,

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:28.338
and had to be medically separated.

00:02:28.362 --> 00:02:31.295
Those never in the military
may find this hard to understand,

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.382
but being told I wasn't getting deployed
to Iraq or Afghanistan

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:35.849
was very devastating for me.

00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:39.114
I have a very clear image of leaving
the base hospital on a stretcher

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:42.008
and my entire platoon is waiting
outside to see if I was OK.

00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:44.466
And then, suddenly,
I was a civilian again.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.695
I knew I wanted to give
acting another shot,

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.523
because -- again, this is me --

00:02:48.547 --> 00:02:52.266
I thought all civilian problems
are small compared to the military.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.047
I mean, what can you really
bitch about now, you know?

00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:56.243
"It's hot.

00:02:56.672 --> 00:02:58.904
Someone should turn
on the air conditioner."

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.728
"This coffee line is too long."

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:02.307
I was a Marine,

00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:03.482
I knew how to survive.

00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:05.444
I'd go to New York and become an actor.

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:06.729
If things didn't work out,

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.737
I'd live in Central Park
and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.

00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:10.762
(Laughter)

00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:13.476
I re-auditioned for Juilliard
and this time I was lucky,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.651
I got in.

00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:17.216
But I was surprised
by how complex the transition was

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.541
from military to civilian.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:22.040
And I was relatively healthy; I can't
imagine going through that process

00:03:22.064 --> 00:03:23.926
on top of a mental or physical injury.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.541
But regardless, it was difficult.

00:03:25.565 --> 00:03:27.735
In part, because I was in acting school --

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.296
I couldn't justify going
to voice and speech class,

00:03:31.757 --> 00:03:34.588
throwing imaginary balls of energy
at the back of the room,

00:03:34.612 --> 00:03:37.175
doing acting exercises
where I gave birth to myself --

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.200
(Laughter)

00:03:38.224 --> 00:03:40.958
while my friends were serving
without me overseas.

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:43.591
But also, because I didn't
know how to apply the things

00:03:43.615 --> 00:03:45.968
I learned in the military
to a civilian context.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:48.151
I mean that both practically
and emotionally.

00:03:48.175 --> 00:03:49.744
Practically, I had to get a job.

00:03:49.768 --> 00:03:51.500
And I was an Infantry Marine,

00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:54.080
where you're shooting machine guns
and firing mortars.

00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:57.651
There's not a lot of places you can
put those skills in the civilian world.

00:03:57.675 --> 00:03:58.676
(Laughter)

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.722
Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning.

00:04:01.103 --> 00:04:03.064
In the military, everything has meaning.

00:04:03.088 --> 00:04:05.341
Everything you do
is either steeped in tradition

00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:06.693
or has a practical purpose.

00:04:06.717 --> 00:04:08.070
You can't smoke in the field

00:04:08.094 --> 00:04:10.445
because you don't want
to give away your position.

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.764
You don't touch your face --
you have to maintain

00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:14.670
a personal level of health and hygiene.

00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:16.520
You face this way when "Colors" plays,

00:04:16.544 --> 00:04:18.734
out of respect for people
who went before you.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.898
Walk this way, talk this way
because of this.

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:22.802
Your uniform is maintained to the inch.

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:25.319
How diligently you followed
those rules spoke volumes

00:04:25.343 --> 00:04:26.978
about the kind of Marine you were.

00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:29.030
Your rank said something
about your history

00:04:29.054 --> 00:04:30.538
and the respect you had earned.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.394
In the civilian world there's no rank.

00:04:32.418 --> 00:04:33.857
Here you're just another body,

00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:37.088
and I felt like I constantly had
to prove my worth all over again.

00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:40.112
And the respect civilians were giving me
while I was in uniform

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:41.762
didn't exist when I was out of it.

00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:43.539
There didn't seem to be a ...

00:04:43.563 --> 00:04:44.763
a sense of community,

00:04:44.787 --> 00:04:47.453
whereas in the military,
I felt this sense of community.

00:04:47.477 --> 00:04:49.206
How often in the civilian world

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:52.982
are you put in a life-or-death situation
with your closest friends

00:04:53.006 --> 00:04:56.312
and they constantly demonstrate
that they're not going to abandon you?

00:04:56.336 --> 00:04:58.389
And meanwhile, at acting school ...

00:04:58.413 --> 00:05:00.871
(Laughter)

00:05:00.895 --> 00:05:02.569
I was really, for the first time,

00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:04.878
discovering playwrights
and characters and plays

00:05:04.902 --> 00:05:06.865
that had nothing to do with the military,

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.244
but were somehow describing
my military experience

00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:11.815
in a way that before
to me was indescribable.

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:14.230
And I felt myself becoming less aggressive

00:05:14.254 --> 00:05:17.457
as I was able to put words
to feelings for the first time

00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:19.600
and realizing what
a valuable tool that was.

00:05:19.624 --> 00:05:22.104
And when I was reflecting
on my time in the military,

00:05:22.128 --> 00:05:24.539
I wasn't first thinking
on the stereotypical drills

00:05:24.563 --> 00:05:26.015
and discipline and pain of it;

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.253
but rather, the small,
intimate human moments,

00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:29.610
moments of great feeling:

00:05:29.634 --> 00:05:32.259
friends going AWOL
because they missed their families,

00:05:32.283 --> 00:05:33.518
friends getting divorced,

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.540
grieving together, celebrating together,

00:05:35.564 --> 00:05:37.499
all within the backdrop of the military.

00:05:37.523 --> 00:05:39.805
I saw my friends battling
these circumstances,

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:42.860
and I watched the anxiety
it produced in them and me,

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:45.470
not being able to express
our feelings about it.

00:05:46.026 --> 00:05:49.074
The military and theater communities
are actually very similar.

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:51.823
You have a group of people
trying to accomplish a mission

00:05:51.847 --> 00:05:53.910
greater than themselves;
it's not about you.

00:05:53.934 --> 00:05:56.902
You have a role, you have to know
your role within that team.

00:05:56.926 --> 00:05:59.085
Every team has a leader or director;

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.659
sometimes they're smart,
sometimes they're not.

00:06:01.683 --> 00:06:04.287
You're forced to be intimate
with complete strangers

00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:05.596
in a short amount of time;

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.667
the self-discipline, the self-maintenance.

00:06:08.132 --> 00:06:10.615
I thought, how great would it be
to create a space

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.966
that combined these two seemingly
dissimilar communities,

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.225
that brought entertainment
to a group of people

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:18.344
that, considering their occupation,

00:06:18.368 --> 00:06:20.812
could handle something
a bit more thought-provoking

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:22.669
than the typical mandatory-fun events

00:06:22.693 --> 00:06:25.754
that I remember being
"volun-told" to go to in the military --

00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:26.780
(Laughter)

00:06:26.804 --> 00:06:29.082
all well-intended but slightly
offensive events,

00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:31.757
like "Win a Date with a San Diego
Chargers Cheerleader,"

00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:33.957
where you answer a question
about pop culture,

00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:35.874
and if you get it right you win a date,

00:06:35.898 --> 00:06:38.244
which was a chaperoned walk
around the parade deck

00:06:38.268 --> 00:06:40.659
with this already married,
pregnant cheerleader --

00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:41.850
(Laughter)

00:06:41.874 --> 00:06:44.254
Nothing against cheerleaders,
I love cheerleaders.

00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:47.390
The point is more, how great would it
be to have theater presented

00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:50.638
through characters that were accessible
without being condescending.

00:06:50.662 --> 00:06:53.567
So we started this nonprofit
called Arts in the Armed Forces,

00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:55.246
where we tried to do that,

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.188
tried to join these two seemingly
dissimilar communities.

00:06:58.212 --> 00:07:02.027
We pick a play or select monologues
from contemporary American plays

00:07:02.051 --> 00:07:05.725
that are diverse in age and race
like a military audience is,

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:08.098
grab a group of incredible
theater-trained actors,

00:07:08.122 --> 00:07:09.975
arm them with incredible material,

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:12.219
keep production value
as minimal as possible --

00:07:12.243 --> 00:07:15.279
no sets, no costumes,
no lights, just reading it --

00:07:15.303 --> 00:07:17.782
to throw all the emphasis on the language

00:07:17.806 --> 00:07:20.521
and to show that theater can
be created at any setting.

00:07:20.545 --> 00:07:21.725
It's a powerful thing,

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:24.635
getting in a room with complete strangers

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:27.307
and reminding ourselves of our humanity,

00:07:27.331 --> 00:07:29.728
and that self-expression
is just as valuable a tool

00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:31.109
as a rifle on your shoulder.

00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:33.138
And for an organization like the military,

00:07:33.162 --> 00:07:36.089
that prides itself on having
acronyms for acronyms,

00:07:36.113 --> 00:07:37.536
you can get lost in the sauce

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.242
when it comes to explaining
a collective experience.

00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:42.110
And I can think of no better community

00:07:42.134 --> 00:07:44.205
to arm with a new means of self-expression

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:46.251
than those protecting our country.

00:07:46.275 --> 00:07:48.755
We've gone all over
the United States and the world,

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:51.460
from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland,

00:07:51.484 --> 00:07:53.930
to Camp Pendleton,
to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait,

00:07:53.954 --> 00:07:55.663
to USAG Bavaria,

00:07:55.687 --> 00:07:57.727
on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.

00:07:57.751 --> 00:07:59.823
And for the performing artists we bring,

00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:01.515
it's a window into a culture

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:03.699
they otherwise would not
have had exposure to.

00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:05.742
And for the military, it's the exact same.

00:08:05.766 --> 00:08:07.753
And in doing this for the past six years,

00:08:07.777 --> 00:08:10.008
I'm always reminded
that acting is many things.

00:08:10.032 --> 00:08:13.237
It's a craft, it's a political act,
it's a business, it's --

00:08:13.888 --> 00:08:16.013
whatever adjective
is most applicable to you.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.476
But it's also a service.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.024
I didn't get to finish mine,

00:08:19.048 --> 00:08:20.680
so whenever I get to be of service

00:08:20.704 --> 00:08:23.981
to this ultimate service industry,
the military, for me, again --

00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:26.052
there's not many things better than that.

00:08:26.076 --> 00:08:27.404
Thank you.

00:08:27.428 --> 00:08:32.016
(Applause)

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.964
We're going to be doing a piece
from Marco Ramirez,

00:08:35.988 --> 00:08:37.682
called "I am not Batman."

00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:40.734
An incredible actor
and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez,

00:08:40.758 --> 00:08:41.933
is going to be reading,

00:08:41.957 --> 00:08:44.441
and Matt Johnson,
who I just met a couple hours ago.

00:08:44.465 --> 00:08:46.616
They're doing it together
for the first time,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.878
so we'll see how it goes.

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.821
Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson.

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:52.999
(Applause)

00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:02.636
Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.970
and the sky is glowing
like mad, radioactive red.

00:09:04.994 --> 00:09:07.116
And if you squint,
you can maybe see the moon

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.006
through a thick layer of cigarette smoke
and airplane exhaust

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.321
that covers the whole city,

00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:13.643
like a mosquito net
that won't let the angels in.

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:14.707
(Drum beat)

00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:16.217
And if you look up high enough,

00:09:16.241 --> 00:09:19.678
you can see me standing
on the edge of an 87-story building.

00:09:19.702 --> 00:09:23.129
And up there, a place for gargoyles
and broken clock towers

00:09:23.153 --> 00:09:26.129
that have stayed still and dead
for maybe like 100 years,

00:09:26.153 --> 00:09:27.664
up there is me.

00:09:27.688 --> 00:09:28.718
(Beat)

00:09:28.742 --> 00:09:30.326
And I'm frickin' Batman.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.389
(Beat)

00:09:31.413 --> 00:09:33.578
And I gots Batmobiles and batarangs

00:09:33.602 --> 00:09:35.997
and frickin' bat caves, like, for real.

00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:37.715
And all it takes is a broom closet

00:09:37.739 --> 00:09:39.683
or a back room or a fire escape,

00:09:39.707 --> 00:09:42.698
and Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone.

00:09:42.722 --> 00:09:44.618
And my navy blue polo shirt,

00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:48.119
the one that looks kinda good on me
but has that hole on it near the butt

00:09:48.143 --> 00:09:51.167
from when it got snagged
on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:53.883
but it isn't even a big deal
because I tuck that part in

00:09:53.907 --> 00:09:55.126
and it's, like, all good.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.067
That blue polo shirt -- it's gone, too!

00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:00.098
And I get like, like ... transformational.

00:10:00.122 --> 00:10:01.122
(Beat)

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:04.769
And nobody pulls out a belt
and whips Batman for talkin' back.

00:10:04.793 --> 00:10:05.810
(Beat)

00:10:05.834 --> 00:10:07.254
Or for not talkin' back.

00:10:07.278 --> 00:10:09.602
And nobody calls Batman simple

00:10:09.626 --> 00:10:11.175
or stupid

00:10:11.199 --> 00:10:12.396
or skinny.

00:10:12.784 --> 00:10:16.003
And nobody fires Batman's brother
from the Eastern Taxi Company

00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:18.059
'cause they was making cutbacks, neither.

00:10:18.083 --> 00:10:19.972
'Cause they got nothing but respect.

00:10:19.996 --> 00:10:22.131
And not like afraid-respect,

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.534
just, like, respect-respect.

00:10:24.558 --> 00:10:25.559
(Laughter)

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.090
'Cause nobody's afraid of you.

00:10:27.114 --> 00:10:29.248
'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm.

00:10:29.272 --> 00:10:30.273
(Beat)

00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:31.851
Ever.
(Double beat)

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:34.312
'Cause all Batman really wants
to do is save people

00:10:34.336 --> 00:10:36.083
and maybe pay abuela's bills one day

00:10:36.107 --> 00:10:37.258
and die happy.

00:10:37.282 --> 00:10:39.478
And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real.

00:10:39.502 --> 00:10:40.513
(Laughter)

00:10:40.537 --> 00:10:41.874
Oh -- and kill the Joker.

00:10:41.898 --> 00:10:43.358
(Drum roll)

00:10:43.382 --> 00:10:46.040
Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone.

00:10:46.064 --> 00:10:48.257
And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:49.463
like a eagle

00:10:49.487 --> 00:10:50.657
or like a --

00:10:50.681 --> 00:10:52.390
no, yeah, like a eagle.

00:10:52.414 --> 00:10:53.415
(Laughter)

00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:56.257
And my cape is flapping in the wind
cause it's frickin' long

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.695
and my pointy ears are on,

00:10:57.719 --> 00:11:00.549
and that mask that covers like half
my face is on, too,

00:11:00.573 --> 00:11:04.049
and I got, like, bulletproof stuff
all in my chest so no one can hurt me.

00:11:04.073 --> 00:11:05.787
And nobody -- nobody! --

00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:07.850
is gonna come between Batman ...

00:11:07.874 --> 00:11:09.053
and justice.

00:11:09.077 --> 00:11:10.879
(Drums)
(Laughter)

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:12.411
From where I am,

00:11:12.435 --> 00:11:14.022
I can hear everything.

00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:15.212
(Silence)

00:11:15.236 --> 00:11:16.396
Somewhere in the city,

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.636
there's a old lady picking
Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.510
and she's putting a piece
of sesame chicken someone spit out

00:11:22.534 --> 00:11:23.845
into her own mouth.

00:11:23.869 --> 00:11:27.178
And somewhere there's a doctor
with a wack haircut in a black lab coat

00:11:27.202 --> 00:11:29.060
trying to find a cure for the diseases

00:11:29.084 --> 00:11:32.042
that are gonna make us
all extinct for real one day.

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.426
And somewhere there's a man,

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.847
a man in a janitor's uniform,

00:11:34.871 --> 00:11:36.804
stumbling home drunk and dizzy

00:11:36.828 --> 00:11:40.580
after spending half his paycheck
on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer,

00:11:40.604 --> 00:11:43.548
and the other half on a four-hour visit
to some lady's house

00:11:43.572 --> 00:11:45.997
on a street where the lights
have all been shot out

00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:49.054
by people who'd rather do
what they do in this city in the dark.

00:11:49.078 --> 00:11:51.004
And half a block away from janitor man,

00:11:51.028 --> 00:11:53.942
there's a group of good-for-nothings
who don't know no better,

00:11:53.966 --> 00:11:56.490
waiting for janitor man
with rusted bicycle chains

00:11:56.514 --> 00:11:58.183
and imitation Louisville Sluggers,

00:11:58.207 --> 00:11:59.989
and if they don't find a cent on him,

00:12:00.013 --> 00:12:01.164
which they won't,

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:04.546
they'll just pound at him till the muscles
in their arms start burning,

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.643
till there's no more teeth to crack out.

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:08.166
But they don't count on me.

00:12:08.664 --> 00:12:10.911
They don't count on no Dark Knight,

00:12:10.935 --> 00:12:13.929
with a stomach full of grocery-store
brand macaroni and cheese

00:12:13.953 --> 00:12:15.542
and cut-up Vienna sausages.

00:12:15.566 --> 00:12:16.567
(Laughter)

00:12:16.591 --> 00:12:19.147
'Cause they'd rather believe
I don't exist.

00:12:19.893 --> 00:12:23.506
And from 87 stories up, I can hear
one of the good-for-nothings say,

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.831
"Gimme the cash!" -- real fast like that,

00:12:25.855 --> 00:12:27.598
just, "Gimme me the fuckin' cash!"

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:31.175
And I see janitor man mumble something
in drunk language and turn pale,

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:32.376
and from 87 stories up,

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.508
I can hear his stomach trying
to hurl its way out his Dickies.

00:12:35.532 --> 00:12:37.413
So I swoop down, like, mad-fast

00:12:37.437 --> 00:12:40.452
and I'm like darkness, I'm like, "Swoosh!"

00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:42.931
And I throw a batarang
at the one naked lightbulb.

00:12:42.955 --> 00:12:43.994
(Cymbal)

00:12:44.018 --> 00:12:46.146
And they're all like, "Whoa, muthafucker!

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.761
Who just turned out the lights?"

00:12:47.785 --> 00:12:48.786
(Laughter)

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.479
"What's that over there?"
"What?"

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:52.096
"Gimme me what you got, old man!"

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.286
"Did anybody hear that?"

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.150
"Hear what? There ain't nothing.
No, really -- there ain't no bat!"

00:12:57.174 --> 00:12:58.401
But then ...

00:12:58.425 --> 00:13:01.904
one out of the three good-for-nothings
gets it to the head -- pow!

00:13:01.928 --> 00:13:04.785
And number two swings blindly
into the dark cape before him,

00:13:04.809 --> 00:13:06.618
but before his fist hits anything,

00:13:06.642 --> 00:13:08.546
I grab a trash can lid and --

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:09.757
right in the gut!

00:13:09.781 --> 00:13:11.896
And number one comes
back with the jump kick,

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.551
but I know judo karate, too,
so I'm like --

00:13:14.575 --> 00:13:18.356
(Drums)

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.531
Twice!

00:13:19.555 --> 00:13:20.556
(Drums)

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.805
(Laughter)

00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:23.281
(Drums)

00:13:23.305 --> 00:13:25.065
But before I can do any more damage,

00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:27.288
suddenly we all hear a "click-click."

00:13:28.217 --> 00:13:30.453
And suddenly everything gets quiet.

00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:33.065
And the one good-for-nothing left standing

00:13:33.089 --> 00:13:35.026
grips a handgun and aims it straight up,

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.631
like he's holding Jesus hostage,

00:13:36.655 --> 00:13:39.540
like he's threatening maybe
to blow a hole in the moon.

00:13:39.564 --> 00:13:41.836
And the good-for-nothing
who got it to the head,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.128
who tried to jump-kick me,

00:13:43.152 --> 00:13:45.645
and the other good-for-nothing
who got it in the gut,

00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:48.550
is both scrambling back away
from the dark figure before 'em.

00:13:48.574 --> 00:13:50.257
And the drunk man, the janitor man,

00:13:50.281 --> 00:13:52.544
is huddled in a corner,
praying to Saint Anthony

00:13:52.568 --> 00:13:54.684
'cause that's the only one
he could remember.

00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:55.709
(Double beat)

00:13:55.733 --> 00:13:56.885
And there's me:

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.680
eyes glowing white,

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:00.711
cape blowing softly in the wind.

00:14:00.735 --> 00:14:01.736
(Beat)

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.257
Bulletproof chest heaving,

00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:05.821
my heart beating right through it
in a Morse code for:

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:06.996
"Fuck with me

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.171
just once

00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:09.346
come on

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.520
just try."

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.910
And the one good-for-nothing
left standing,

00:14:12.934 --> 00:14:14.249
the one with the handgun --

00:14:14.273 --> 00:14:15.424
yeah, he laughs.

00:14:15.448 --> 00:14:16.630
And he lowers his arm.

00:14:16.654 --> 00:14:17.964
And he points it at me

00:14:17.988 --> 00:14:19.439
and gives the moon a break.

00:14:19.463 --> 00:14:21.636
And he aims it right
between my pointy ears,

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.609
like goal posts and he's special teams.

00:14:25.444 --> 00:14:28.113
And janitor man is still
calling Saint Anthony,

00:14:28.137 --> 00:14:29.493
but he ain't pickin' up.

00:14:30.277 --> 00:14:31.955
And for a second,

00:14:31.979 --> 00:14:33.233
it seems like ...

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.765
maybe I'm gonna lose.

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:40.057
Nah!

00:14:40.081 --> 00:14:41.097
(Drums)

00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:42.306
Shoot! Shoot! Fwa-ka-ka!

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.481
"Don't kill me, man!"

00:14:43.505 --> 00:14:45.463
Snap! Wrist crack! Neck! Slash!

00:14:45.487 --> 00:14:49.470
Skin meets acid:
"Ahhhhhhh!"

00:14:49.494 --> 00:14:50.732
And he's on the floor

00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:51.954
and I'm standing over him

00:14:51.978 --> 00:14:53.887
and I got the gun in my hands now

00:14:53.911 --> 00:14:56.575
and I hate guns, I hate holding 'em
'cause I'm Batman.

00:14:56.599 --> 00:14:57.777
And, asterisk:

00:14:57.801 --> 00:15:01.359
Batman don't like guns 'cause his parents
got iced by guns a long time ago.

00:15:01.383 --> 00:15:02.598
But for just a second,

00:15:02.622 --> 00:15:03.940
my eyes glow white,

00:15:03.964 --> 00:15:05.123
and I hold this thing

00:15:05.147 --> 00:15:07.130
for I could speak to the good-for-nothing

00:15:07.154 --> 00:15:08.900
in a language he maybe understands.

00:15:08.924 --> 00:15:10.471
Click-click!

00:15:10.495 --> 00:15:11.508
(Beat)

00:15:11.532 --> 00:15:14.097
And the good-for-nothings
become good-for-disappearing

00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:17.816
into whatever toxic waste, chemical
sludge shithole they crawled out of.

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:20.760
And it's just me and janitor man.

00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:23.025
And I pick him up,

00:15:23.049 --> 00:15:26.182
and I wipe sweat and cheap perfume
off his forehead.

00:15:26.206 --> 00:15:27.642
And he begs me not to hurt him

00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:30.196
and I grab him tight
by his janitor-man shirt collar,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.507
and I pull him to my face

00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:33.611
and he's taller than me
but the cape helps,

00:15:33.635 --> 00:15:36.028
so he listens when I look him
straight in the eyes.

00:15:36.052 --> 00:15:37.773
And I say two words to him:

00:15:38.467 --> 00:15:40.075
"Go home."

00:15:41.282 --> 00:15:42.528
And he does,

00:15:42.552 --> 00:15:45.020
checking behind his shoulder
every 10 feet.

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:47.633
And I swoosh from building
to building on his way there

00:15:47.657 --> 00:15:49.061
'cause I know where he lives.

00:15:49.085 --> 00:15:51.889
And I watch his hands tremble
as he pulls out his key chain

00:15:51.913 --> 00:15:53.622
and opens the door to his building.

00:15:53.646 --> 00:15:54.917
And I'm back in bed

00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:57.213
before he even walks in
through the front door.

00:15:57.548 --> 00:15:59.167
And I hear him turn on the faucet

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:01.447
and pour himself a glass
of warm tap water.

00:16:01.796 --> 00:16:03.692
And he puts the glass back in the sink.

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:05.800
And I hear his footsteps.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.685
And they get slower
as they get to my room.

00:16:09.758 --> 00:16:12.883
And he creaks my door open,
like, mad-slow.

00:16:13.953 --> 00:16:15.781
And he takes a step in,

00:16:15.805 --> 00:16:17.161
which he never does.

00:16:17.677 --> 00:16:18.677
(Beat)

00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:20.797
And he's staring off into nowhere,

00:16:20.821 --> 00:16:23.486
his face, the color
of sidewalks in summer.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.091
And I act like I'm just waking up

00:16:25.115 --> 00:16:27.524
and I say, "Ah, what's up, Pop?"

00:16:28.452 --> 00:16:30.723
And janitor man says nothing to me.

00:16:31.753 --> 00:16:32.914
But I see in the dark,

00:16:32.938 --> 00:16:34.311
I see his arms go limp

00:16:34.335 --> 00:16:36.449
and his head turns back, like, towards me.

00:16:36.473 --> 00:16:38.849
And he lifts it for I can see his face,

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.739
for I could see his eyes.

00:16:40.763 --> 00:16:43.135
And his cheeks is drippin',
but not with sweat.

00:16:43.704 --> 00:16:45.485
And he just stands there breathing,

00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:47.941
like he remembers my eyes glowing white,

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:50.655
like he remembers my bulletproof chest,

00:16:51.513 --> 00:16:53.456
like he remembers he's my pop.

00:16:57.575 --> 00:17:00.531
And for a long time I don't say nothin'.

00:17:02.583 --> 00:17:04.609
And he turns around, hand on the doorknob.

00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:06.061
And he ain't looking my way,

00:17:06.085 --> 00:17:08.627
but I hear him mumble two words to me:

00:17:10.253 --> 00:17:11.667
"I'm sorry."

00:17:14.317 --> 00:17:17.596
And I lean over, and I open
my window just a crack.

00:17:18.697 --> 00:17:20.382
If you look up high enough,

00:17:21.036 --> 00:17:22.612
you could see me.

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:24.936
And from where I am --

00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:26.912
(Cymbals)

00:17:27.692 --> 00:17:29.442
I could hear everything.

00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:40.500
(Applause)

00:17:40.544 --> 00:17:41.761
Thank you.

00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:49.140
(Applause)
