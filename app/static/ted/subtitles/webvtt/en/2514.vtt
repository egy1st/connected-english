WEBVTT

00:00:02.222 --> 00:00:04.888
OK, first, some introductions.

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:08.142
My mom, Jennie, took this picture.

00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:11.497
That's my dad, Frank, in the middle.

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.283
And on his left, my sisters:

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:18.791
Mary Catherine, Judith Ann,
Theresa Marie.

00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:22.739
John Patrick's sitting on his lap
and Kevin Michael's on his right.

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.212
And in the pale-blue windbreaker,

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:28.381
Susan Diane. Me.

00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.619
I loved growing up in a big family.

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:36.832
And one of my favorite things
was picking names.

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:41.369
But by the time child
number seven came along,

00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:43.710
we had nearly run out of middle names.

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:46.917
It was a long deliberation

00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:50.948
before we finally settled
on Jennifer Bridget.

00:00:52.353 --> 00:00:55.084
Every parent in this audience

00:00:55.108 --> 00:00:57.732
knows the joy and excitement

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.194
of picking a new baby's name.

00:01:00.913 --> 00:01:02.835
And I was excited and thrilled

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.562
to help my mom in that special
ceremonial moment.

00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:09.863
But it's not like that everywhere.

00:01:11.163 --> 00:01:13.846
I travel a lot and I see a lot.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:17.366
But it took me by surprise to learn

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.569
in an area of Ethiopia,

00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:23.274
parents delay picking the names
for their new babies

00:01:23.298 --> 00:01:24.849
by a month or more.

00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:27.325
Why delay?

00:01:28.278 --> 00:01:31.645
Why not take advantage
of this special ceremonial time?

00:01:32.423 --> 00:01:34.820
Well, they delay because they're afraid.

00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:38.224
They're afraid their baby will die.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.230
And this loss might be a little more
bearable without a name.

00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:49.153
A face without a name might help them feel

00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:51.946
just a little less attached.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:55.496
So here we are in one part of the world --

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.261
a time of joy, excitement,
dreaming of the future of that child --

00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:03.155
while in another world,

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.099
parents are filled with dread,

00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:09.698
not daring to dream
of a future for their child

00:02:09.722 --> 00:02:11.588
beyond a few precious weeks.

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:14.185
How can that be?

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:20.674
How can it be that 2.6 million babies

00:02:20.698 --> 00:02:22.492
die around the world

00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:24.936
before they're even one month old?

00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:27.901
2.6 million.

00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:31.353
That's the population of Vancouver.

00:02:32.512 --> 00:02:34.631
And the shocking thing is:

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:36.341
Why?

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:40.135
In too many cases, we simply don't know.

00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:45.271
Now, I remember recently seeing
an updated pie chart.

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:47.463
And the pie chart was labeled,

00:02:47.487 --> 00:02:50.999
"Causes of death in children
under five worldwide."

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:55.883
And there was a pretty big section
of that pie chart, about 40 percent --

00:02:55.907 --> 00:02:59.269
40 percent was labeled "neonatal."

00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:02.454
Now, "neonatal" is not a cause of death.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.687
Neonatal is simply an adjective,

00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:10.579
an adjective that means that the child
is less than one month old.

00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:16.013
For me, "neonatal" said:
"We have no idea."

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.270
Now, I'm a scientist. I'm a doctor.

00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:20.787
I want to fix things.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.445
But you can't fix
what you can't define.

00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:30.995
So our first step in restoring
the dreams of those parents

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.196
is to answer the question:

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.169
Why are babies dying?

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.094
So today, I want to talk
about a new approach,

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:42.055
an approach that I feel

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.763
will not only help us
know why babies are dying,

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:50.744
but is beginning to completely transform

00:03:50.768 --> 00:03:52.552
the whole field of global health.

00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:57.361
It's called "Precision Public Health."

00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:03.615
For me, precision medicine comes
from a very special place.

00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:07.701
I trained as a cancer doctor,
an oncologist.

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.697
I got into it because I wanted
to help people feel better.

00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:16.296
But too often my treatments
made them feel worse.

00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:22.013
I still remember young women
being driven to my clinic

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.744
by their moms --

00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:29.410
adults, who had to be helped
into my exam room by their mothers.

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:31.951
They were so weak

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:34.204
from the treatment I had given them.

00:04:35.283 --> 00:04:39.483
But at the time, in those front lines
in the war on cancer,

00:04:39.507 --> 00:04:41.141
we had few tools.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.722
And the tools we did have
couldn't differentiate

00:04:45.746 --> 00:04:49.020
between the cancer cells
that we wanted to hit hard

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.109
and those healthy cells
that we wanted to preserve.

00:04:54.663 --> 00:04:57.618
And so the side effects that you're
all very familiar with --

00:04:57.642 --> 00:05:00.476
hair loss, being sick to your stomach,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.614
having a suppressed immune system,
so infection was a constant threat --

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:07.964
were always surrounding us.

00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:11.694
And then I moved
to the biotechnology industry.

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:16.349
And I got to work on a new approach
for breast cancer patients

00:05:16.373 --> 00:05:21.374
that could do a better job
of telling the healthy cells

00:05:21.398 --> 00:05:23.740
from the unhealthy or cancer cells.

00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:26.589
It's a drug called Herceptin.

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:30.579
And what Herceptin allowed us to do

00:05:30.603 --> 00:05:35.814
is to precisely target
HER2-positive breast cancer,

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.718
at the time, the scariest
form of breast cancer.

00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:43.926
And that precision let us
hit hard the cancer cells,

00:05:44.727 --> 00:05:48.817
while sparing and being more
gentle on the normal cells.

00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:52.157
A huge breakthrough.

00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:54.261
It felt like a miracle,

00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:58.040
so much so that today,

00:05:58.064 --> 00:06:00.595
we're harnessing all those tools --

00:06:01.156 --> 00:06:06.680
big data, consumer monitoring,
gene sequencing and more --

00:06:06.704 --> 00:06:10.025
to tackle a broad variety of diseases.

00:06:11.044 --> 00:06:16.113
That's allowing us to target individuals

00:06:16.137 --> 00:06:19.421
with the right remedies at the right time.

00:06:20.731 --> 00:06:25.191
Precision medicine
revolutionized cancer therapy.

00:06:25.655 --> 00:06:27.257
Everything changed.

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:31.308
And I want everything to change again.

00:06:32.214 --> 00:06:34.466
So I've been asking myself:

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.308
Why should we limit

00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:41.141
this smarter, more precise,
better way to tackle diseases

00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:42.328
to the rich world?

00:06:44.105 --> 00:06:45.617
Now, don't misunderstand me --

00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:48.967
I'm not talking about bringing
expensive medicines like Herceptin

00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:50.876
to the developing world,

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.150
although I'd actually kind of like that.

00:06:53.707 --> 00:06:55.672
What I am talking about

00:06:55.696 --> 00:07:00.064
is moving from this precise
targeting for individuals

00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:02.731
to tackle public health problems

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.496
in populations.

00:07:06.487 --> 00:07:11.070
Now, OK, I know probably
you're thinking, "She's crazy.

00:07:11.094 --> 00:07:14.086
You can't do that. That's too ambitious."

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.332
But here's the thing:

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.478
we're already doing this in a limited way,

00:07:20.502 --> 00:07:23.572
and it's already starting
to make a big difference.

00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:26.135
So here's what's happening.

00:07:26.952 --> 00:07:29.542
Now, I told you I trained
as a cancer doctor.

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:34.015
But like many, many doctors
who trained in San Francisco in the '80s,

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:36.130
I also trained as an AIDS doctor.

00:07:37.077 --> 00:07:38.685
It was a terrible time.

00:07:39.504 --> 00:07:41.542
AIDS was a death sentence.

00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:44.011
All my patients died.

00:07:45.329 --> 00:07:47.233
Now, things are better,

00:07:47.257 --> 00:07:51.836
but HIV/AIDS remains
a terrible global challenge.

00:07:52.473 --> 00:07:57.924
Worldwide, about 17 million women
are living with HIV.

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:02.041
We know that when these women
become pregnant,

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:04.678
they can transfer the virus to their baby.

00:08:06.551 --> 00:08:08.803
We also know in the absence of therapy,

00:08:08.827 --> 00:08:12.310
half those babies will not survive
until the age of two.

00:08:13.446 --> 00:08:18.583
But we know that antiretroviral therapy
can virtually guarantee

00:08:18.607 --> 00:08:21.558
that she will not transmit
the virus to the baby.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.241
So what do we do?

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:28.270
Well, a one-size-fits-all approach,
kind of like that blast of chemo,

00:08:28.294 --> 00:08:31.474
would mean we test and treat
every pregnant woman in the world.

00:08:31.952 --> 00:08:33.333
That would do the job.

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:36.141
But it's just not practical.

00:08:37.223 --> 00:08:42.863
So instead, we target those areas
where HIV rates are the highest.

00:08:43.444 --> 00:08:47.821
We know in certain countries
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:52.007
we can test and treat pregnant women
where rates are highest.

00:08:52.794 --> 00:08:55.952
This precision approach
to a public health problem

00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:58.377
has cut by nearly half

00:08:58.401 --> 00:09:01.156
HIV transmission from mothers to baby

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.014
in the last five years.

00:09:03.485 --> 00:09:07.850
(Applause)

00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:14.007
Screening pregnant women
in certain areas in the developing world

00:09:14.031 --> 00:09:17.135
is a powerful example

00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:22.674
of how precision public health
can change things on a big scale.

00:09:24.452 --> 00:09:25.603
So ...

00:09:26.213 --> 00:09:27.390
How do we do that?

00:09:27.414 --> 00:09:29.579
We can do that because we know.

00:09:29.896 --> 00:09:32.214
We know who to target,

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.925
what to target,

00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:36.241
where to target and how to target.

00:09:36.685 --> 00:09:40.987
And that, for me, are the important 
elements of precision public health:

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.068
who, what, where and how.

00:09:45.814 --> 00:09:49.715
But let's go back
to the 2.6 million babies

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:51.756
who die before they're one month old.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.040
Here's the problem: we just don't know.

00:09:54.753 --> 00:09:57.217
It may seem unbelievable,

00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:02.104
but the way we figure out
the causes of infant mortality

00:10:02.128 --> 00:10:05.139
in those countries
with the highest infant mortality

00:10:05.163 --> 00:10:07.159
is a conversation with mom.

00:10:07.948 --> 00:10:12.326
A health worker asks a mom
who has just lost her child,

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.019
"Was the baby vomiting?
Did they have a fever?"

00:10:16.043 --> 00:10:17.992
And that conversation may take place

00:10:18.016 --> 00:10:21.927
as long as three months
after the baby has died.

00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:26.099
Now, put yourself
in the shoes of that mom.

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:31.195
It's a heartbreaking,
excruciating conversation.

00:10:31.833 --> 00:10:34.762
And even worse -- it's not that helpful,

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.588
because we might know
there was a fever or vomiting,

00:10:38.612 --> 00:10:40.325
but we don't know why.

00:10:41.171 --> 00:10:44.653
So in the absence of knowing
that knowledge,

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:47.659
we cannot prevent that mom, that family,

00:10:47.683 --> 00:10:49.781
or other families in that community

00:10:49.805 --> 00:10:51.753
from suffering the same tragedy.

00:10:52.804 --> 00:10:56.278
But what if we applied
a precision public health approach?

00:10:57.064 --> 00:10:58.458
Let's say, for example,

00:10:58.482 --> 00:11:01.416
we find out in certain areas of Africa

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.186
that babies are dying
because of a bacterial infection

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.757
transferred from the mother to the baby,

00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:10.254
known as Group B streptococcus.

00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:16.511
In the absence of treatment,
mom has a seven times higher chance

00:11:16.535 --> 00:11:18.735
that her next baby will die.

00:11:20.124 --> 00:11:24.025
Once we define the problem,
we can prevent that death

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:28.132
with something as cheap
and safe as penicillin.

00:11:29.894 --> 00:11:32.445
We can do that because then we'll know.

00:11:33.034 --> 00:11:34.566
And that's the point:

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.026
once we know, we can bring
the right interventions

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.589
to the right population
in the right places

00:11:41.613 --> 00:11:43.036
to save lives.

00:11:44.973 --> 00:11:48.725
With this approach,
and with these interventions

00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:50.774
and others like them,

00:11:50.798 --> 00:11:52.509
I have no doubt

00:11:52.533 --> 00:11:55.080
that a precision public health approach

00:11:55.104 --> 00:11:58.590
can help our world achieve
our 15-year goal.

00:11:59.423 --> 00:12:03.752
And that would translate
into a million babies' lives saved

00:12:03.776 --> 00:12:05.413
every single year.

00:12:06.253 --> 00:12:10.563
One million babies every single year.

00:12:11.706 --> 00:12:13.548
And why would we stop there?

00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:17.616
A much more powerful approach
to public health --

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.405
imagine what might be possible.

00:12:20.912 --> 00:12:24.301
Why couldn't we more effectively
tackle malnutrition?

00:12:25.643 --> 00:12:29.920
Why wouldn't we prevent
cervical cancer in women?

00:12:30.832 --> 00:12:33.650
And why not eradicate malaria?

00:12:33.674 --> 00:12:34.675
(Applause)

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:35.912
Yes, clap for that!

00:12:35.936 --> 00:12:39.864
(Applause)

00:12:39.888 --> 00:12:42.731
So, you know, I live
in two different worlds,

00:12:42.755 --> 00:12:45.963
one world populated by scientists,

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.487
and another world populated
by public health professionals.

00:12:51.319 --> 00:12:53.747
The promise of precision public health

00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:56.095
is to bring these two worlds together.

00:12:56.876 --> 00:13:00.421
But you know, we all live in two worlds:

00:13:01.254 --> 00:13:04.333
the rich world and the poor world.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.610
And what I'm most excited about
about precision public health

00:13:09.634 --> 00:13:12.093
is bridging these two worlds.

00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:16.071
Every day in the rich world,

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:19.350
we're bringing incredible
talent and tools --

00:13:19.374 --> 00:13:21.333
everything at our disposal --

00:13:21.357 --> 00:13:26.270
to precisely target diseases
in ways I never imagined

00:13:26.294 --> 00:13:28.128
would be possible.

00:13:28.152 --> 00:13:33.168
Surely, we can tap into
that kind of talent and tools

00:13:33.192 --> 00:13:35.630
to stop babies dying in the poor world.

00:13:37.201 --> 00:13:39.250
If we did,

00:13:39.274 --> 00:13:43.331
then every parent would have
the confidence

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:47.683
to name their child
the moment that child is born,

00:13:48.746 --> 00:13:53.931
daring to dream that that child's life
will be measured in decades,

00:13:54.498 --> 00:13:55.742
not days.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.481
Thank you.

00:13:57.505 --> 00:14:05.137
(Applause)
