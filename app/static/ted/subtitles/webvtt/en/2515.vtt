WEBVTT

00:00:00.727 --> 00:00:02.358
Thank you very much. Good evening.

00:00:02.382 --> 00:00:05.698
Some of you may have noticed
that my last name is Nutt.

00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:09.139
And if you did,
you are forgiven for wondering

00:00:09.163 --> 00:00:12.079
how a Nutt managed
to end up in a war zone.

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:16.444
I actually was offered, right out
of medical school, and accepted

00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:20.305
a volunteer contract to work
with UNICEF in war-torn Somalia,

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.808
that was worth one dollar.

00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:25.243
And, you see, I had to be paid this dollar

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:28.402
in the event that the UN needed
to issue an evacuation order,

00:00:28.426 --> 00:00:30.496
so that I would be covered.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.892
I was, after all, heading into one
of the world's most dangerous places.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.475
And by now, some of you
may be asking yourselves,

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.031
and I just want to reassure you,

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:42.354
that I did get half the money up front.

00:00:42.378 --> 00:00:44.166
(Laughter)

00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:47.569
But you see, this is how,
with 50 cents in my pocket,

00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:49.885
I ended up in Baidoa, Somalia.

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:52.885
Journalists called it the "city of death."

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.123
And they called it the city of death

00:00:55.147 --> 00:00:58.305
because 300,000 people
had lost their lives there --

00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:02.363
300,000 people,

00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:06.543
mostly as a result
of war-related famine and disease.

00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:11.434
I was part of a team that was tasked
with trying to figure out

00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:14.427
how best to respond
to this humanitarian catastrophe.

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:17.554
It was right on the heels
of the Rwandan genocide,

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:20.245
and aid money to the region was drying up.

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:22.311
Many aid organizations, unfortunately,

00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:24.911
had been forced to close their doors.

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:28.645
And so the question that I was asked
to specifically help answer,

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:34.345
which is one that aid workers ask
themselves in war zones the world over,

00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:37.250
is: What the hell do we do now?

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.535
You know, the security environment
in Somalia at that moment in time --

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:43.590
and nothing has really changed too much --

00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:48.052
can best be described as "Mad Max"
by way of "A Clockwork Orange."

00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:54.608
And I remember very distinctly
a couple of days after my arrival,

00:01:54.632 --> 00:01:57.237
I went up to a feeding clinic.

00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:00.505
There were dozens of women
who were standing in line,

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:03.269
and they were clutching
their infants very close.

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:07.054
About 20 minutes into
this conversation I was having

00:02:07.078 --> 00:02:09.102
with this one young woman,

00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:10.502
I leaned forward

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.796
and tried to put my finger
in the palm of her baby's hand.

00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:17.536
And when I did this,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.558
I discovered that her baby
was already in rigor.

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:24.003
She was stiff,

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.114
and her little, lifeless hand
was curled into itself.

00:02:28.986 --> 00:02:32.053
She had died hours before

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.946
of malnutrition and dehydration.

00:02:36.242 --> 00:02:39.140
I later learned
that as her baby was dying,

00:02:39.164 --> 00:02:43.486
this young woman had
been held for two days

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.246
by some teenage boys who were armed
with Kalashnikov rifles,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.800
and they were trying
to shake her down for more money,

00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:53.506
money she very clearly did not have.

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:57.148
And this is a scene that I have confronted

00:02:57.172 --> 00:02:59.759
in war zones the world over;

00:03:00.435 --> 00:03:05.748
places where kids, some as young
as eight -- they are this big --

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:08.668
and those kids, they have
never been to school.

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.121
But they have fought and they have killed
with automatic rifles.

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.502
Is this just the way the world is?

00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:24.800
Some will you tell you
that war is unavoidably human.

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:28.347
After all, it is as old
as existence itself.

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:36.053
We say never again, and yet it happens
again and again and again.

00:03:37.232 --> 00:03:42.963
But I will tell you
that I have seen the absolute worst

00:03:43.671 --> 00:03:47.444
of what we as human beings
are capable of doing to one another,

00:03:48.222 --> 00:03:52.627
and yet I still believe
a different outcome is possible.

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:54.893
Do you want to know why?

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:57.854
Because over 20 years of doing this work,

00:03:57.878 --> 00:04:00.589
going in and out of war zones
around the world,

00:04:00.613 --> 00:04:02.756
I have come to understand

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.700
that there are aspects of this problem

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:08.802
that we, all of us, as people
occupying this shared space,

00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:11.604
that we can change --

00:04:11.628 --> 00:04:15.562
not through force or coercion or invasion,

00:04:15.586 --> 00:04:19.315
but by simply looking at all
of the options available to us

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.058
and choosing the ones that favor
peace at the expense of war,

00:04:25.722 --> 00:04:29.924
instead of war at the expense of peace.

00:04:31.158 --> 00:04:32.420
How so?

00:04:32.444 --> 00:04:34.183
Well, I want you to consider this:

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:39.664
there are at least 800 million
small arms and light weapons

00:04:39.688 --> 00:04:42.144
in circulation in the world today.

00:04:42.788 --> 00:04:46.277
The vast majority of civilians,
like that young baby,

00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:48.690
who are dying in war zones
around the world,

00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:51.689
are dying at the hands
of various armed groups

00:04:51.713 --> 00:04:58.039
who rely on a near-infinite supply
of cheap, easy and efficient weapons

00:04:58.063 --> 00:05:02.723
to rape, threaten, intimidate
and brutalize those civilians

00:05:02.747 --> 00:05:04.151
at every turn.

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:06.088
How cheap?

00:05:06.112 --> 00:05:07.728
Well, in some parts of the world,

00:05:07.752 --> 00:05:12.150
you can buy an AK-47
for as little as 10 dollars.

00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:15.030
In many places in which I have worked,

00:05:15.621 --> 00:05:20.118
it is easier to get access
to an automatic rifle

00:05:20.142 --> 00:05:24.263
than it is to get access
to clean drinking water.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.636
And so now the important part:

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.818
Can anything be done about this?

00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:33.802
To answer that question,

00:05:33.826 --> 00:05:35.836
let's take a look
at this map of the world.

00:05:36.246 --> 00:05:40.630
And now, let's add in all of the countries
that are currently at war,

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:43.600
and the number of people
who have either died

00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:46.092
or have been displaced
as a result of that violence.

00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:47.512
It is a staggering number --

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:50.233
more than 40 million people.

00:05:50.764 --> 00:05:53.431
But you will also notice
something else about this map.

00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:55.575
You will notice
that most of those countries

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:56.953
are in the Global South.

00:05:57.453 --> 00:05:59.743
Now, let's look at the countries

00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:04.622
that are the world's top 20 exporters
of small arms in the world.

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:06.801
And what do we notice?

00:06:07.331 --> 00:06:08.794
Well, you see them in green.

00:06:08.818 --> 00:06:12.708
You will notice that those are mostly
countries in the Global North,

00:06:12.732 --> 00:06:14.430
primarily Western countries.

00:06:14.454 --> 00:06:15.670
What does this tell us?

00:06:15.694 --> 00:06:19.185
This tells us that most of the people
who are dying in war

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:21.112
are living in poor countries,

00:06:21.136 --> 00:06:23.950
and yet most of the people
who are profiting from war

00:06:24.609 --> 00:06:28.971
are living in rich countries --
people like you and me.

00:06:29.804 --> 00:06:32.606
And then what if we go
beyond small arms for a second.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.854
What if we look at all weapons
in circulation in the world?

00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:37.662
Who does the biggest business?

00:06:37.686 --> 00:06:40.161
Well, roughly 80 percent of those weapons

00:06:40.185 --> 00:06:43.727
come from none other
than the five permanent members

00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:45.642
of the United Nations Security Council,

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:47.094
plus Germany.

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:49.047
It's shocking, isn't it?

00:06:49.515 --> 00:06:52.191
Now, some of you might be saying
at this moment in time,

00:06:52.215 --> 00:06:55.466
"Oh yeah, but OK,
hang on a second there ... Nutt."

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.695
(Laughter)

00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:00.080
Grade school was spectacular for me.

00:07:00.104 --> 00:07:02.048
It was, really, a wonderful experience.

00:07:02.072 --> 00:07:05.026
(Laughter)

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.262
But you might be saying to yourselves,

00:07:07.286 --> 00:07:10.634
You know, all of these weapons
in war zones -- they're not a cause,

00:07:10.658 --> 00:07:13.080
but an effect of the violence
that plagues them

00:07:13.104 --> 00:07:14.588
each and every single day.

00:07:14.612 --> 00:07:16.795
You know, places like Iraq
and Afghanistan,

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:20.233
where they need these weapons
to be able to maintain law and order,

00:07:20.257 --> 00:07:23.878
promote peace and security,
to combat terror groups --

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:26.397
surely this is a good thing.

00:07:26.773 --> 00:07:29.461
Let's take a look at that assumption
for just one moment,

00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:33.271
because you see there has been
a boom in the small-arms trade

00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:35.079
since the start of the War on Terror.

00:07:35.103 --> 00:07:38.301
In fact, it is a business
that has grown threefold

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:40.268
over the past 15 years.

00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:44.245
And now let's compare that
to the number of people

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:48.095
who have directly died
in armed conflict around the world

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:49.294
in that same period.

00:07:49.627 --> 00:07:51.072
What do you notice?

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.453
Well, you notice that, in fact,
that also goes up

00:07:53.477 --> 00:07:55.088
roughly three- to fourfold.

00:07:55.112 --> 00:07:58.777
They basically go up
and end at the same point.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.080
Now, we can have a circular argument here

00:08:02.104 --> 00:08:06.176
about whether this increase
in fatalities is a response

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.109
to the increase of small arms,
or the other way around.

00:08:10.133 --> 00:08:12.629
But here's what we should
really take away from this.

00:08:12.653 --> 00:08:14.313
What we should take away from this

00:08:14.337 --> 00:08:18.755
is that this is a relationship
worth scrutinizing,

00:08:19.447 --> 00:08:24.313
especially when you consider
that small arms that were shipped to Iraq

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.131
for use by the Iraqi Army,

00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:29.402
or to Syria for so-called
moderate opposition fighters,

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:33.619
that those arms, many of them,
are now in the hands of ISIS;

00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:36.836
or when you consider that arms
that were shipped to Libya

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.573
are now actively drifting
across the Sahel,

00:08:39.597 --> 00:08:44.340
and ending up with groups
like Boko Haram and al Qaeda

00:08:44.364 --> 00:08:47.069
and other militant groups.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.784
And therein lies the problem.

00:08:50.466 --> 00:08:51.618
Because, you see,

00:08:51.642 --> 00:08:57.161
small arms anywhere
are a menace everywhere,

00:08:57.831 --> 00:09:02.174
because their first stop
is rarely their last.

00:09:02.904 --> 00:09:05.320
Spending on war per person per year

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:09.389
now amounts to about 249 dollars --

00:09:09.413 --> 00:09:11.814
249 dollars per person,

00:09:11.838 --> 00:09:16.777
which is roughly 12 times
what we spend on foreign aid,

00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:20.238
money that is used to educate
and vaccinate children

00:09:20.262 --> 00:09:23.125
and combat malnutrition
in the Global South.

00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:27.111
But we can shift that balance.

00:09:27.604 --> 00:09:28.755
How do we do this?

00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:31.621
Well, it is essentially a problem
of both supply and demand,

00:09:31.645 --> 00:09:33.588
so we can tackle it from both sides.

00:09:33.993 --> 00:09:35.663
On the supply side,

00:09:35.687 --> 00:09:38.861
we can push our governments

00:09:38.885 --> 00:09:41.948
to adopt international arms
transparency mechanisms

00:09:41.972 --> 00:09:43.773
like the Arms Trade Treaty,

00:09:43.797 --> 00:09:47.564
which makes it so that rich countries
have to be more accountable

00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:49.263
for where their arms are going

00:09:49.287 --> 00:09:51.686
and what their arms might be used for.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.975
Here in the United States,

00:09:52.999 --> 00:09:57.616
the largest arms-exporting country
in the world by far,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.565
President Obama has rightly signed
the Arms Trade Treaty,

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:04.150
but none of it takes effect,
it isn't binding,

00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:07.683
until it is approved
and ratified by the Senate.

00:10:08.865 --> 00:10:11.819
This is where we need
to make our voices heard.

00:10:11.843 --> 00:10:15.557
You know, the curbing of small arms --

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:18.383
it's not going to solve
the problem of war.

00:10:18.407 --> 00:10:21.689
Increased control mechanisms
won't solve that problem.

00:10:21.713 --> 00:10:24.960
But it's an important step
in the right direction.

00:10:24.984 --> 00:10:27.857
And it's up to all of us
who live in those rich countries

00:10:27.881 --> 00:10:29.691
to make change here.

00:10:29.994 --> 00:10:33.203
What about on the demand side?

00:10:33.227 --> 00:10:35.980
You know, there are generations
around the world

00:10:36.004 --> 00:10:38.060
who are being lost to war.

00:10:39.202 --> 00:10:42.193
It is possible to disrupt
that cycle of violence

00:10:42.217 --> 00:10:46.210
with investments in education,
in strengthening the rule of law

00:10:46.234 --> 00:10:48.615
and in economic development,
especially for women.

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:50.267
I have personally seen

00:10:50.291 --> 00:10:53.332
just how incredibly powerful
those kinds of efforts can be

00:10:53.356 --> 00:10:54.690
around the world.

00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:56.834
But here's the thing:

00:10:56.858 --> 00:10:58.266
they take time,

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.329
which means for you as individuals,
if you want to give,

00:11:02.353 --> 00:11:04.060
please, by all means do it.

00:11:04.084 --> 00:11:07.647
But know that how you give
is just as important

00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:09.678
as how much you give.

00:11:10.147 --> 00:11:12.592
Regular contributions
like monthly contributions

00:11:12.616 --> 00:11:15.904
are a far more effective way of giving,

00:11:15.928 --> 00:11:18.641
because they allow
humanitarian organizations

00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:22.990
to properly plan and be invested
over the long term,

00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:28.639
and to be present in the lives of families
who have been affected by war,

00:11:28.663 --> 00:11:32.899
wars that many of us, frankly,
all too quickly forget.

00:11:33.939 --> 00:11:39.299
When I first got on that plane
for Somalia as a young doctor,

00:11:40.942 --> 00:11:44.239
I had no idea what it meant
to live with war.

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:47.921
But I can tell you that I know
what it means now.

00:11:48.636 --> 00:11:50.981
And I know what it means

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:55.704
to lie in bed in the pitch-black night

00:11:56.684 --> 00:12:00.327
and listen to that haunting
"pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!"

00:12:01.295 --> 00:12:02.914
of automatic gunfire,

00:12:04.002 --> 00:12:06.425
and wonder with absolute dread

00:12:07.298 --> 00:12:10.885
how many minutes I have left
until it will be right on top of me.

00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:16.593
I can tell you that it is a terrifying
and agonizing fear,

00:12:16.617 --> 00:12:20.974
one that millions of people
around the world are forced to confront

00:12:20.998 --> 00:12:23.164
each and every single day,

00:12:23.188 --> 00:12:24.521
especially children.

00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:28.157
Over the years of doing this work,

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:33.293
unfortunately, war has killed
far too many people close to me.

00:12:34.277 --> 00:12:37.253
And on at least a couple of occasions,

00:12:37.277 --> 00:12:40.047
war has very nearly killed me as well.

00:12:41.309 --> 00:12:46.183
But I firmly believe,

00:12:46.207 --> 00:12:48.984
which is why I get up and do
what I do every single day,

00:12:49.786 --> 00:12:52.514
that we can make different choices here.

00:12:53.284 --> 00:12:56.103
Because you see, war is ours,

00:12:56.127 --> 00:12:57.706
as human beings.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.342
We buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.659
We are therefore
not powerless to solve it.

00:13:06.569 --> 00:13:08.240
On the contrary,

00:13:08.264 --> 00:13:11.215
we are the only ones who can.

00:13:11.731 --> 00:13:14.841
Thank you very much, and I want
to wish you the greatest success.

00:13:14.865 --> 00:13:21.739
(Applause)
