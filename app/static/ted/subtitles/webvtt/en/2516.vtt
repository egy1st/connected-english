00:00:00.905 --> 00:00:04.525
Eric Hirshberg: So I assume that Norman
doesn't need much of an introduction,

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.054
but TED's audience is global,

00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:07.275
it's diverse,

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.285
so I've been tasked
with starting with his bio,

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.595
which could easily take up
the entire 18 minutes.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.562
So instead we're going to do
93 years in 93 seconds or less.

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:17.736
(Laughter)

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:19.805
You were born in New Hampshire.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.544
Norman Lear: New Haven, Connecticut.

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:22.854
EH: New Haven, Connecticut.

00:00:22.878 --> 00:00:25.766
(Laughter)

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.410
NL: There goes seven more seconds.

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:28.677
EH: Nailed it.

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:30.691
(Laughter)

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.947
You were born in New Haven, Connecticut.

00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.376
Your father was a con man --
I got that right.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.147
He was taken away to prison
when you were nine years old.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.328
You flew 52 missions
as a fighter pilot in World War II.

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:42.836
You came back to --

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.010
NL: Radio operator.

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:47.025
EH: You came to LA
to break into Hollywood,

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:48.929
first in publicity, then in TV.

00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:51.112
You had no training as a writer, formally,

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:52.540
but you hustled your way in.

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:54.017
Your breakthrough, your debut,

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:56.309
was a little show
called "All in the Family."

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.437
You followed that up with a string of hits

00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:00.579
that to this day is unmatched
in Hollywood:

00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:02.643
"Sanford and Son," "Maude," "Good Times,"

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.493
"The Jeffersons," "One Day at a Time,"

00:01:04.517 --> 00:01:05.930
"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,"

00:01:05.954 --> 00:01:07.717
to name literally a fraction of them.

00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:09.518
Not only are they all commercially --

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:13.548
(Applause)

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:16.557
Not only are they all
commercially successful,

00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:18.555
but many of them push our culture forward

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.941
by giving the underrepresented
members of society

00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:23.001
their first prime-time voice.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.644
You have seven shows
in the top 10 at one time.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:28.262
At one point,

00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:31.623
you aggregate an audience
of 120 million people per week

00:01:31.647 --> 00:01:32.873
watching your content.

00:01:32.897 --> 00:01:35.136
That's more than the audience
for Super Bowl 50,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.399
which happens once a year.

00:01:36.423 --> 00:01:37.645
NL: Holy shit.

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:39.442
(Laughter)

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.688
(Applause)

00:01:41.712 --> 00:01:44.071
EH: And we're not even
to the holy shit part.

00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:45.134
(Laughter)

00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:47.885
You land yourself
on Richard Nixon's enemies list --

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.059
he had one.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.494
That's an applause line, too.

00:01:51.518 --> 00:01:53.320
(Applause)

00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:56.941
You're inducted into the TV Hall of Fame
on the first day that it exists.

00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:58.365
Then came the movies.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:59.969
"Fried Green Tomatoes,"

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:02.018
"The Princess Bride," "Stand By Me,"

00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:03.215
"This Is Spinal Tap."

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.376
(Applause)

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.932
Again, just to name a fraction.

00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:06.987
(Applause)

00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:08.517
Then you wipe the slate clean,

00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:12.588
start a third act as a political activist
focusing on protecting the First Amendment

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:14.562
and the separation of church and state.

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:16.476
You start People For The American Way.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.358
You buy the Declaration of Independence

00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:19.873
and give it back to the people.

00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:22.235
You stay active in both
entertainment and politics

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.791
until the ripe old of age of 93,

00:02:23.815 --> 00:02:25.061
when you write a book

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:27.249
and make a documentary
about your life story.

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:28.447
And after all that,

00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.013
they finally think
you're ready for a TED Talk.

00:02:31.037 --> 00:02:32.818
(Laughter)

00:02:32.842 --> 00:02:37.414
(Applause)

00:02:37.438 --> 00:02:39.236
NL: I love being here.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.975
And I love you for agreeing to do this.

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.988
EH: Thank you for asking. It's my honor.

00:02:44.012 --> 00:02:45.559
So here's my first question.

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.633
Was your mother proud of you?

00:02:47.657 --> 00:02:49.653
(Laughter)

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:51.388
NL: My mother ...

00:02:51.412 --> 00:02:52.579
what a place to start.

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:57.118
Let me put it this way --

00:02:57.142 --> 00:02:58.762
when I came back from the war,

00:02:58.786 --> 00:03:04.374
she showed me the letters
that I had written her from overseas,

00:03:04.398 --> 00:03:06.795
and they were absolute love letters.

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:11.540
(Laughter)

00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:13.286
This really sums up my mother.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.881
They were love letters,

00:03:14.905 --> 00:03:17.107
as if I had written them to --

00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:18.428
they were love letters.

00:03:21.214 --> 00:03:25.747
A year later I asked my mother
if I could have them,

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:30.048
because I'd like to keep them
all the years of my life ...

00:03:30.072 --> 00:03:31.581
She had thrown them away.

00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:35.668
(Laughter)

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.194
That's my mother.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.696
(Laughter)

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.240
The best way I can sum it up
in more recent times is --

00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:49.561
this is also more recent times --

00:03:49.585 --> 00:03:50.767
a number of years ago,

00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:54.664
when they started the Hall of Fame
to which you referred.

00:03:54.688 --> 00:03:56.471
It was a Sunday morning,

00:03:56.495 --> 00:04:01.749
when I got a call from the fellow who ran
the TV Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.

00:04:01.773 --> 00:04:04.742
He was calling me to tell me
they had met all day yesterday

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:08.979
and he was confidentially telling me
they were going to start a hall of fame

00:04:09.003 --> 00:04:11.757
and these were the inductees.

00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:17.123
I started to say "Richard Nixon,"

00:04:17.147 --> 00:04:18.789
because Richard Nixon --

00:04:18.813 --> 00:04:20.684
EH: I don't think he was on their list.

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:23.231
NL: William Paley, who started CBS,

00:04:23.255 --> 00:04:26.889
David Sarnoff, who started NBC,

00:04:26.913 --> 00:04:28.068
Edward R. Murrow,

00:04:28.092 --> 00:04:31.794
the greatest of the foreign
correspondents,

00:04:31.818 --> 00:04:32.989
Paddy Chayefsky --

00:04:33.013 --> 00:04:35.775
I think the best writer
that ever came out of television --

00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:37.776
Milton Berle, Lucille Ball

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.181
and me.

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:40.356
EH: Not bad.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.095
NL: I call my mother
immediately in Hartford, Connecticut.

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:44.642
"Mom, this is what's happened,

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:46.265
they're starting a hall of fame."

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.012
I tell her the list of names and me,

00:04:48.036 --> 00:04:49.194
and she says,

00:04:49.218 --> 00:04:51.955
"Listen, if that's what they
want to do, who am I to say?"

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.480
(Laughter)

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:58.420
(Applause)

00:04:58.444 --> 00:04:59.801
That's my Ma.

00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:01.705
I think it earns that kind of a laugh

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.825
because everybody
has a piece of that mother.

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.023
(Laughter)

00:05:05.047 --> 00:05:07.904
EH: And the sitcom Jewish mother
is born, right there.

00:05:08.348 --> 00:05:13.158
So your father also played
a large role in your life,

00:05:13.182 --> 00:05:14.832
mostly by his absence.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.013
NL: Yeah.

00:05:16.037 --> 00:05:18.660
EH: Tell us what happened
when you were nine years old.

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:23.563
NL: He was flying to Oklahoma

00:05:23.587 --> 00:05:25.658
with three guys that my mother said,

00:05:25.682 --> 00:05:28.064
"I don't want you to have
anything to do with them,

00:05:28.088 --> 00:05:29.341
I don't trust those men."

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.390
That's when I heard,

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:32.897
maybe not for the first time,

00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:36.587
"Stifle yourself, Jeanette, I'm going."

00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:38.088
And he went.

00:05:38.112 --> 00:05:43.129
It turns out he was picking up
some fake bonds,

00:05:43.153 --> 00:05:46.676
which he was flying
across the country to sell.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:51.311
But the fact that he was going
to Oklahoma in a plane,

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:55.026
and he was going to bring me
back a 10-gallon hat,

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.748
just like Ken Maynard,
my favorite cowboy wore.

00:06:02.124 --> 00:06:07.212
You know, this was a few years
after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic.

00:06:07.236 --> 00:06:10.833
I mean, it was exotic
that my father was going there.

00:06:10.857 --> 00:06:12.098
But when he came back,

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:14.186
they arrested him as he got off the plane.

00:06:14.553 --> 00:06:18.949
That night newspapers
were all over the house,

00:06:18.973 --> 00:06:21.593
my father was with his hat
in front of his face,

00:06:21.617 --> 00:06:23.116
manacled to a detective.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.378
And my mother was selling the furniture,
because we were leaving --

00:06:27.402 --> 00:06:31.211
she didn't want to stay
in that state of shame,

00:06:31.235 --> 00:06:33.700
in Chelsea, Massachusetts.

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:38.192
And selling the furniture --

00:06:38.216 --> 00:06:40.276
the house was loaded with people.

00:06:40.712 --> 00:06:42.830
And in the middle of all of that,

00:06:42.854 --> 00:06:49.042
some strange horse's ass
put his hand on my shoulder and said,

00:06:49.066 --> 00:06:51.192
"Well, you're the man of the house now."

00:06:52.982 --> 00:06:58.553
I'm crying, and this asshole says,
"You're the man of the house now."

00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:02.202
And I think that was the moment

00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:06.336
I began to understand the foolishness
of the human condition.

00:07:07.678 --> 00:07:09.836
So ...

00:07:10.558 --> 00:07:15.138
it took a lot of years to look back at it
and feel it was a benefit.

00:07:16.437 --> 00:07:17.587
But --

00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:19.879
EH: It's interesting
you call it a benefit.

00:07:19.903 --> 00:07:22.334
NL: Benefit in that it gave
me that springboard.

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:26.138
I mean that I could think

00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:29.350
how foolish it was to say
to this crying nine-year-old boy,

00:07:29.374 --> 00:07:31.279
"You're the man of the house now."

00:07:31.303 --> 00:07:34.716
And then I was crying, and then he said,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.890
"And men of the house don't cry."

00:07:37.755 --> 00:07:39.295
And I ...

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:40.604
(Laughter)

00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:42.044
So ...

00:07:44.413 --> 00:07:45.920
I look back, and I think

00:07:45.944 --> 00:07:50.087
that's when I learned the foolishness
of the human condition,

00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:53.039
and it's been that gift that I've used.

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:56.543
EH: So you have a father who's absent,

00:07:56.567 --> 00:07:59.513
you have a mother for whom
apparently nothing is good enough.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:05.132
Do you think that starting out as a kid
who maybe never felt heard

00:08:05.156 --> 00:08:06.678
started you down a journey

00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:08.480
that ended with you being an adult

00:08:08.504 --> 00:08:10.805
with a weekly audience
of 120 million people?

00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:14.879
NL: I love the way you put that question,

00:08:14.903 --> 00:08:18.722
because I guess
I've spent my life wanting --

00:08:18.746 --> 00:08:20.732
if anything, wanting to be heard.

00:08:24.898 --> 00:08:26.152
I think --

00:08:28.524 --> 00:08:30.096
It's a simple answer, yes,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.436
that was what sparked --

00:08:33.857 --> 00:08:35.564
well, there were other things, too.

00:08:35.588 --> 00:08:38.419
When my father was away,

00:08:38.443 --> 00:08:44.485
I was fooling with a crystal radio set
that we had made together,

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:49.080
and I caught a signal that turned out
to be Father Coughlin.

00:08:49.684 --> 00:08:50.834
(Laughter)

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.112
Yeah, somebody laughed.

00:08:54.136 --> 00:08:55.563
(Laughter)

00:08:55.587 --> 00:08:57.018
But not funny,

00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:58.542
this was a horse's --

00:08:58.566 --> 00:09:00.182
another horse's ass --

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.797
who was very vocal
about hating the New Deal

00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.284
and Roosevelt and Jews.

00:09:06.256 --> 00:09:09.589
The first time I ran into an understanding

00:09:09.613 --> 00:09:12.506
that there were people
in this world that hated me

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.466
because I was born to Jewish parents.

00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:19.418
And that had an enormous
effect on my life.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:22.042
EH: So you had a childhood

00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:25.148
with little in the way
of strong male role models,

00:09:25.172 --> 00:09:26.708
except for your grandfather.

00:09:27.272 --> 00:09:29.152
Tell us about him.

00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:30.326
NL: Oh, my grandfather.

00:09:31.323 --> 00:09:35.784
Well here's the way I always
talked about that grandfather.

00:09:37.606 --> 00:09:38.756
There were parades,

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.661
lots of parades when I was a kid.

00:09:40.685 --> 00:09:42.597
There were parades on Veteran's Day --

00:09:42.621 --> 00:09:44.189
there wasn't a President's Day.

00:09:44.213 --> 00:09:46.126
There was Abraham Lincoln's birthday,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.254
George Washington's birthday

00:09:48.278 --> 00:09:50.768
and Flag Day ...

00:09:51.821 --> 00:09:53.580
And lots of little parades.

00:09:53.604 --> 00:09:55.033
My grandfather used to take me

00:09:55.057 --> 00:09:56.783
and we'd stand on the street corner,

00:09:56.807 --> 00:09:58.143
he'd hold my hand,

00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:01.230
and I'd look up and I'd see a tear
running down his eye.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.274
And he meant a great deal to me.

00:10:06.298 --> 00:10:11.656
And he used to write presidents
of the United States.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.300
Every letter started,

00:10:13.324 --> 00:10:16.403
"My dearest, darling Mr. President,"

00:10:16.427 --> 00:10:21.045
and he'd tell him something
wonderful about what he did.

00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:24.001
But when he disagreed
with the President, he also wrote,

00:10:24.025 --> 00:10:25.692
"My dearest, darling Mr. President,

00:10:25.716 --> 00:10:27.510
Didn't I tell you last week ...?"

00:10:27.534 --> 00:10:29.113
(Laughter)

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:34.739
And I would run down the stairs
every now and then

00:10:34.763 --> 00:10:35.995
and pick up the mail.

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:37.238
We were three flights up,

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:39.487
74 York Street, New Haven, Connecticut.

00:10:40.945 --> 00:10:47.557
And I'd pick up a little white envelope
reading, "Shya C. called at this address."

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:55.270
And that's the story I have told
about my grandfather --

00:10:55.294 --> 00:10:57.315
EH: They wrote him back
on the envelopes --

00:10:57.339 --> 00:10:58.559
NL: They wrote back.

00:11:00.862 --> 00:11:05.268
But I have shown them myself,

00:11:05.292 --> 00:11:10.410
going way back to Phil Donahue
and others before him,

00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:14.743
literally dozens of interviews
in which I told that story.

00:11:16.283 --> 00:11:21.402
This will be the second time I have said
the whole story was a lie.

00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:28.343
The truth was my grandfather
took me to parades,

00:11:28.367 --> 00:11:29.690
we had lots of those.

00:11:30.094 --> 00:11:32.474
The truth is a tear came down his eye.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.047
The truth is he would write
an occasional letter,

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:39.474
and I did pick up those little envelopes.

00:11:40.536 --> 00:11:43.948
But "My dearest darling Mr. President,"

00:11:43.972 --> 00:11:46.434
all the rest of it,

00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:50.974
is a story I borrowed from a good friend

00:11:50.998 --> 00:11:56.508
whose grandfather was that grandfather
who wrote those letters.

00:11:58.506 --> 00:12:04.951
And, I mean, I stole
Arthur Marshall's grandfather

00:12:04.975 --> 00:12:06.705
and made him my own.

00:12:08.997 --> 00:12:10.147
Always.

00:12:10.171 --> 00:12:12.785
When I started to write my memoir --

00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:14.261
"Even this --"

00:12:14.285 --> 00:12:15.450
How about that?

00:12:15.474 --> 00:12:17.705
"Even This I Get to Experience."

00:12:18.848 --> 00:12:20.599
When I started to write the memoir

00:12:20.623 --> 00:12:22.182
and I started to think about it,

00:12:22.206 --> 00:12:23.356
and then I --

00:12:24.275 --> 00:12:25.425
I --

00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:30.331
I did a reasonable amount of crying,

00:12:30.355 --> 00:12:34.188
and I realized how much
I needed the father.

00:12:35.139 --> 00:12:38.440
So much so that I appropriated
Arthur Marshall's grandfather.

00:12:39.575 --> 00:12:42.012
So much so, the word "father" --

00:12:42.573 --> 00:12:44.518
I have six kids by the way.

00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:46.980
My favorite role in life.

00:12:49.482 --> 00:12:51.958
It and husband to my wife Lyn.

00:12:55.972 --> 00:13:00.453
But I stole the man's identity
because I needed the father.

00:13:01.243 --> 00:13:04.926
Now I've gone through a whole lot of shit

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.957
and come out on the other side,

00:13:06.981 --> 00:13:08.568
and I forgive my father --

00:13:08.592 --> 00:13:09.802
the best thing I --

00:13:09.826 --> 00:13:11.115
the worst thing I --

00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:14.795
The word I'd like to use about him
and think about him is --

00:13:14.819 --> 00:13:16.187
he was a rascal.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.933
The fact that he lied
and stole and cheated

00:13:21.957 --> 00:13:23.157
and went to prison ...

00:13:25.349 --> 00:13:29.206
I submerge that in the word "rascal."

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:35.936
EH: Well there's a saying that amateurs
borrow and professionals steal.

00:13:36.366 --> 00:13:37.591
NL: I'm a pro.

00:13:37.615 --> 00:13:38.766
EH: You're a pro.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.106
(Laughter)

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.277
And that quote is widely
attributed to John Lennon,

00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:45.491
but it turns out
he stole it from T.S. Eliot.

00:13:45.515 --> 00:13:46.904
So you're in good company.

00:13:46.928 --> 00:13:48.086
(Laughter)

00:13:50.602 --> 00:13:52.927
EH: I want to talk about your work.

00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:55.657
Obviously the impact of your work
has been written about

00:13:55.681 --> 00:13:58.047
and I'm sure you've heard
about it all your life:

00:13:58.071 --> 00:13:59.222
what it meant to people,

00:13:59.246 --> 00:14:00.676
what it meant to our culture,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.701
you heard the applause when I just
named the names of the shows,

00:14:03.725 --> 00:14:07.153
you raised half the people
in the room through your work.

00:14:07.177 --> 00:14:10.712
But have there ever been any stories
about the impact of your work

00:14:10.736 --> 00:14:12.050
that surprised you?

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.954
NL: Oh, god --

00:14:14.387 --> 00:14:19.279
surprised me and delighted me
from head to toe.

00:14:21.437 --> 00:14:26.930
There was "An Evening with Norman Lear"
within the last year

00:14:26.954 --> 00:14:30.458
that a group of hip-hop impresarios,

00:14:30.482 --> 00:14:34.418
performers and the Academy put together.

00:14:35.902 --> 00:14:37.806
The subtext of "An Evening with ..."

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.919
was: What do a 92-year-old Jew --

00:14:41.943 --> 00:14:43.094
then 92 --

00:14:43.118 --> 00:14:45.131
and the world of hip-hop have in common?

00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:47.844
Russell Simmons
was among seven on the stage.

00:14:48.783 --> 00:14:53.104
And when he talked about the shows,

00:14:53.128 --> 00:14:57.661
he wasn't talking about the Hollywood,

00:14:57.685 --> 00:15:01.409
George Jefferson in "The Jeffersons,"

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:03.848
or the show that was a number five show.

00:15:04.847 --> 00:15:10.498
He was talking about a simple
thing that made a big --

00:15:13.324 --> 00:15:14.525
EH: Impact on him?

00:15:14.549 --> 00:15:16.487
NL: An impact on him --

00:15:16.511 --> 00:15:19.018
I was hesitating over the word, "change."

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.993
It's hard for me to imagine,

00:15:22.017 --> 00:15:23.845
you know, changing somebody's life,

00:15:23.869 --> 00:15:25.654
but that's the way he put it.

00:15:25.678 --> 00:15:31.767
He saw George Jefferson
write a check on "The Jeffersons,"

00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:35.401
and he never knew that a black man
could write a check.

00:15:36.788 --> 00:15:41.741
And he says it just
impacted his life so --

00:15:41.765 --> 00:15:43.450
it changed his life.

00:15:43.474 --> 00:15:46.948
And when I hear things like that --

00:15:46.972 --> 00:15:48.647
little things --

00:15:48.671 --> 00:15:51.853
because I know that there isn't
anybody in this audience

00:15:51.877 --> 00:15:58.380
that wasn't likely responsible today for
some little thing they did for somebody,

00:15:58.404 --> 00:16:03.746
whether it's as little as a smile
or an unexpected "Hello,"

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.134
that's how little this thing was.

00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:11.104
It could have been the dresser of the set

00:16:11.128 --> 00:16:12.814
who put the checkbook on the thing,

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:16.527
and George had nothing to do
while he was speaking, so he wrote it,

00:16:16.551 --> 00:16:17.827
I don't know.

00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:19.001
But --

00:16:19.634 --> 00:16:22.572
EH: So in addition to the long list
I shared in the beginning,

00:16:22.596 --> 00:16:25.242
I should have also mentioned
that you invented hip-hop.

00:16:25.266 --> 00:16:26.367
(Laughter)

00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:27.834
NL: Well ...

00:16:28.755 --> 00:16:30.240
EH: I want to talk about --

00:16:30.264 --> 00:16:31.564
NL: Well, then do it.

00:16:31.588 --> 00:16:36.398
(Laughter)

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.468
EH: You've lead a life of accomplishment,

00:16:40.492 --> 00:16:42.428
but you've also built a life of meaning.

00:16:42.809 --> 00:16:45.381
And all of us strive to do
both of those things --

00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:46.999
not all of us manage to.

00:16:47.984 --> 00:16:51.755
But even those of us who do manage
to accomplish both of those,

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:54.349
very rarely do we figure out
how to do them together.

00:16:54.884 --> 00:16:59.764
You managed to push culture
forward through your art

00:16:59.788 --> 00:17:03.646
while also achieving world-beating
commercial success.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.860
How did you do both?

00:17:11.391 --> 00:17:17.207
NL: Here's where my mind goes when I hear
that recitation of all I accomplished.

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:23.360
This planet is one of a billion,

00:17:23.384 --> 00:17:24.573
they tell us,

00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:30.693
in a universe
of which there are billions --

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.285
billions of universes,

00:17:32.309 --> 00:17:35.916
billions of planets ...

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.823
which we're trying to save

00:17:37.847 --> 00:17:39.631
and it requires saving.

00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:42.723
But ...

00:17:43.699 --> 00:17:47.349
anything I may have accomplished is --

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.809
my sister once asked me
what she does about something

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:54.775
that was going on
in Newington, Connecticut.

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:57.724
And I said, "Write your alderman
or your mayor or something."

00:17:57.748 --> 00:18:00.886
She said, "Well I'm not
Norman Lear, I'm Claire Lear."

00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:06.335
And that was the first time
I said what I'm saying,

00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:10.698
I said, "Claire. With everything
you think about what I may have done

00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:12.199
and everything you've done," --

00:18:12.223 --> 00:18:14.566
she never left Newington --

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.400
"can you get your fingers close enough

00:18:16.424 --> 00:18:20.341
when you consider the size
of the planet and so forth,

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:23.579
to measure anything I may have done
to anything you may have done?"

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.380
So ...

00:18:26.486 --> 00:18:30.074
I am convinced we're all responsible

00:18:30.098 --> 00:18:33.319
for doing as much
as I may have accomplished.

00:18:35.269 --> 00:18:37.159
And I understand what you're saying --

00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:38.898
EH: It's an articulate deflection --

00:18:38.922 --> 00:18:42.880
NL: But you have to really buy into
the size and scope

00:18:42.904 --> 00:18:44.858
of the creator's enterprise, here.

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:47.466
EH: But here on this planet
you have really mattered.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.640
NL: I'm a son of a gun.

00:18:48.981 --> 00:18:50.502
(Laughter)

00:18:50.526 --> 00:18:54.324
EH: So I have one more question for you.

00:18:54.348 --> 00:18:55.621
How old do you feel?

00:18:57.411 --> 00:19:01.823
NL: I am the peer
of whoever I'm talking to.

00:19:02.704 --> 00:19:04.076
EH: Well, I feel 93.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:10.660
(Applause)

00:19:10.684 --> 00:19:11.994
NL: We out of here?

00:19:12.018 --> 00:19:13.902
EH: Well, I feel 93 years old,

00:19:13.926 --> 00:19:17.715
but I hope to one day feel as young
as the person I'm sitting across from.

00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:18.889
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:19:18.913 --> 00:19:20.337
the incomparable Norman Lear.

00:19:20.361 --> 00:19:26.025
(Applause)

00:19:26.049 --> 00:19:27.200
NL: Thank you.

00:19:27.224 --> 00:19:33.165
(Applause)
