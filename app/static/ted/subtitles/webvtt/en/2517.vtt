WEBVTT

00:00:01.206 --> 00:00:03.342
I'm driven by pure passion

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.039
to create photographs that tell stories.

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:11.245
Photography can be described
as the recording of a single moment

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.475
frozen within a fraction of time.

00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:18.337
Each moment or photograph
represents a tangible piece

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.874
of our memories as time passes.

00:00:21.547 --> 00:00:25.136
But what if you could capture more
than one moment in a photograph?

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:28.533
What if a photograph
could actually collapse time,

00:00:29.222 --> 00:00:32.140
compressing the best moments
of the day and the night

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:34.663
seamlessly into one single image?

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:38.172
I've created a concept
called "Day to Night"

00:00:38.196 --> 00:00:39.823
and I believe it's going to change

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:41.284
the way you look at the world.

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:42.458
I know it has for me.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.870
My process begins by photographing
iconic locations,

00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:50.735
places that are part of what I call
our collective memory.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.000
I photograph from a fixed vantage point,
and I never move.

00:00:55.024 --> 00:00:59.371
I capture the fleeting moments
of humanity and light as time passes.

00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:02.848
Photographing for anywhere
from 15 to 30 hours

00:01:02.872 --> 00:01:05.109
and shooting over 1,500 images,

00:01:05.508 --> 00:01:08.213
I then choose the best moments
of the day and night.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.010
Using time as a guide,

00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:15.327
I seamlessly blend those best moments
into one single photograph,

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:17.999
visualizing our conscious
journey with time.

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:21.400
I can take you to Paris

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:23.273
for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.

00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:26.456
And I can show you the
early morning rowers

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.797
along the River Seine.

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.396
And simultaneously,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.654
I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.319
And in between, I can show you
the romance of the City of Light.

00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:43.177
I am essentially a street photographer
from 50 feet in the air,

00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:45.531
and every single thing you see
in this photograph

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:47.416
actually happened on this day.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.702
Day to Night is a global project,

00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:55.019
and my work has always been about history.

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:59.417
I'm fascinated by the concept
of going to a place like Venice

00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:01.969
and actually seeing it during
a specific event.

00:02:01.993 --> 00:02:05.426
And I decided I wanted to see
the historical Regata,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.929
an event that's actually been
taking place since 1498.

00:02:09.906 --> 00:02:13.548
The boats and the costumes
look exactly as they did then.

00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:18.323
And an important element that I really
want you guys to understand is:

00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:19.821
this is not a timelapse,

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:23.709
this is me photographing
throughout the day and the night.

00:02:25.181 --> 00:02:28.487
I am a relentless collector
of magical moments.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:32.546
And the thing that drives me
is the fear of just missing one of them.

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:40.869
The entire concept came about in 1996.

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:45.118
LIFE Magazine commissioned me
to create a panoramic photograph

00:02:45.142 --> 00:02:49.797
of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's
film Romeo + Juliet.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.087
I got to the set and realized:
it's a square.

00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:58.509
So the only way I could actually create
a panoramic was to shoot a collage

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:00.872
of 250 single images.

00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.949
So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes
embracing.

00:03:04.973 --> 00:03:07.763
And as I pan my camera to the right,

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:10.385
I noticed there was a mirror on the wall

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.824
and I saw they were
actually reflecting in it.

00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:14.778
And for that one moment, that one image

00:03:14.802 --> 00:03:16.668
I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss

00:03:16.692 --> 00:03:18.061
for this one picture?"

00:03:18.085 --> 00:03:20.876
And then I came back
to my studio in New York,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.821
and I hand-glued these 250 images together

00:03:24.845 --> 00:03:27.670
and stood back and went,
"Wow, this is so cool!

00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:30.051
I'm changing time in a photograph."

00:03:30.422 --> 00:03:34.612
And that concept actually
stayed with me for 13 years

00:03:34.636 --> 00:03:38.619
until technology finally
has caught up to my dreams.

00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:42.504
This is an image I created
of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.809
And I'm going to show you a little video

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:47.386
that gives you an idea of what
it's like being with me

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.306
when I do these pictures.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.766
To start with, you have to understand
that to get views like this,

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.519
most of my time is spent up high,
and I'm usually in a cherry picker

00:03:56.543 --> 00:03:57.694
or a crane.

00:03:57.718 --> 00:04:01.110
So this is a typical day,
12-18 hours, non-stop

00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:03.296
capturing the entire day unfold.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.266
One of the things that's great
is I love to people-watch.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.703
And trust me when I tell you,

00:04:08.727 --> 00:04:10.925
this is the greatest seat
in the house to have.

00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:15.330
But this is really how I go about
creating these photographs.

00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:19.497
So once I decide on my view
and the location,

00:04:19.521 --> 00:04:22.680
I have to decide where day begins
and night ends.

00:04:22.704 --> 00:04:24.846
And that's what I call the time vector.

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:28.759
Einstein described time as a fabric.

00:04:29.257 --> 00:04:31.635
Think of the surface of a trampoline:

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.246
it warps and stretches with gravity.

00:04:34.924 --> 00:04:37.718
I see time as a fabric as well,

00:04:37.742 --> 00:04:43.071
except I take that fabric and flatten it,
compress it into single plane.

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:45.294
One of the unique aspects
of this work is also,

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.818
if you look at all my pictures,

00:04:46.842 --> 00:04:48.352
the time vector changes:

00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:50.062
sometimes I'll go left to right,

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:54.114
sometimes front to back,
up or down, even diagonally.

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:57.986
I am exploring the space-time continuum

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.249
within a two-dimensional still photograph.

00:05:01.114 --> 00:05:03.018
Now when I do these pictures,

00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:05.994
it's literally like a real-time puzzle
going on in my mind.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.408
I build a photograph based on time,

00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:11.455
and this is what I call the master plate.

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:14.527
This can take us several
months to complete.

00:05:15.126 --> 00:05:17.425
The fun thing about this work is

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.779
I have absolutely zero control
when I get up there

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:23.194
on any given day and capture photographs.

00:05:23.218 --> 00:05:25.512
So I never know who's
going to be in the picture,

00:05:25.536 --> 00:05:28.519
if it's going to be a great
sunrise or sunset -- no control.

00:05:28.543 --> 00:05:30.361
It's at the end of the process,

00:05:30.385 --> 00:05:33.393
if I've had a really great day
and everything remained the same,

00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:36.026
that I then decide who's in and who's out,

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.785
and it's all based on time.

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:41.232
I'll take those best moments that I pick
over a month of editing

00:05:41.256 --> 00:05:44.898
and they get seamlessly blended
into the master plate.

00:05:46.168 --> 00:05:48.463
I'm compressing the day and night

00:05:48.487 --> 00:05:49.637
as I saw it,

00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:54.097
creating a unique harmony between
these two very discordant worlds.

00:05:55.268 --> 00:05:59.106
Painting has always been a really
important influence in all my work

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.841
and I've always been a huge fan
of Albert Bierstadt,

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:03.699
the great Hudson River School painter.

00:06:03.723 --> 00:06:07.096
He inspired a recent series
that I did on the National Parks.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.389
This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.

00:06:10.347 --> 00:06:13.092
So this is the photograph
I created of Yosemite.

00:06:13.427 --> 00:06:17.206
This is actually the cover story
of the 2016 January issue

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.523
of National Geographic.

00:06:19.592 --> 00:06:22.347
I photographed for over
30 hours in this picture.

00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:24.242
I was literally on the side of a cliff,

00:06:25.044 --> 00:06:29.085
capturing the stars
and the moonlight as it transitions,

00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:30.964
the moonlight lighting El Capitan.

00:06:30.988 --> 00:06:34.982
And I also captured this transition
of time throughout the landscape.

00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:39.590
The best part is obviously seeing
the magical moments of humanity

00:06:39.614 --> 00:06:40.918
as time changed --

00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:44.291
from day into night.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.610
And on a personal note,

00:06:47.634 --> 00:06:51.759
I actually had a photocopy
of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.

00:06:51.783 --> 00:06:54.031
And when that sun started
to rise in the valley,

00:06:54.055 --> 00:06:56.305
I started to literally shake
with excitement

00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:58.607
because I looked at the painting and I go,

00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:02.020
"Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's
exact same lighting

00:07:02.044 --> 00:07:03.837
100 years earlier."

00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:08.616
Day to Night is about all the things,

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.887
it's like a compilation of all
the things I love

00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:13.047
about the medium of photography.

00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:14.724
It's about landscape,

00:07:14.748 --> 00:07:16.347
it's about street photography,

00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:18.673
it's about color, it's about architecture,

00:07:18.697 --> 00:07:21.814
perspective, scale --
and, especially, history.

00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:24.372
This is one of the most historical moments

00:07:24.396 --> 00:07:25.784
I've been able to photograph,

00:07:25.808 --> 00:07:29.157
the 2013 Presidential Inauguration
of Barack Obama.

00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:31.807
And if you look closely in this picture,

00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:33.908
you can actually see time changing

00:07:33.932 --> 00:07:35.877
in those large television sets.

00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:38.517
You can see Michelle
waiting with the children,

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.400
the president now greets the crowd,

00:07:40.424 --> 00:07:41.676
he takes his oath,

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.707
and now he's speaking to the people.

00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:48.770
There's so many challenging aspects
when I create photographs like this.

00:07:49.096 --> 00:07:51.069
For this particular photograph,

00:07:51.093 --> 00:07:54.708
I was in a 50-foot scissor lift
up in the air

00:07:54.732 --> 00:07:56.026
and it was not very stable.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.218
So every time my assistant and I
shifted our weight,

00:07:59.242 --> 00:08:00.780
our horizon line shifted.

00:08:00.804 --> 00:08:02.423
So for every picture you see,

00:08:02.447 --> 00:08:04.836
and there were about
1,800 in this picture,

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.819
we both had to tape our feet into position

00:08:07.843 --> 00:08:09.986
every time I clicked the shutter.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.178
(Applause)

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:18.059
I've learned so many extraordinary
things doing this work.

00:08:18.868 --> 00:08:22.273
I think the two most important
are patience

00:08:22.297 --> 00:08:24.479
and the power of observation.

00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.360
When you photograph a city
like New York from above,

00:08:28.384 --> 00:08:30.498
I discovered that those people in cars

00:08:30.522 --> 00:08:32.832
that I sort of live with everyday,

00:08:32.856 --> 00:08:34.912
they don't look like people
in cars anymore.

00:08:34.936 --> 00:08:37.414
They feel like a giant school of fish,

00:08:37.438 --> 00:08:39.398
it was a form of emergent behavior.

00:08:40.063 --> 00:08:42.983
And when people describe
the energy of New York,

00:08:43.007 --> 00:08:45.943
I think this photograph begins
to really capture that.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.995
When you look closer in my work,

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:50.211
you can see there's stories going on.

00:08:50.235 --> 00:08:53.174
You realize that Times Square is a canyon,

00:08:53.198 --> 00:08:55.474
it's shadow and it's sunlight.

00:08:55.883 --> 00:08:59.081
So I decided, in this photograph,
I would checkerboard time.

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:01.166
So wherever the shadows are, it's night

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.311
and wherever the sun is,
it's actually day.

00:09:04.453 --> 00:09:06.703
Time is this extraordinary thing

00:09:06.727 --> 00:09:09.338
that we never can really
wrap our heads around.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.942
But in a very unique and special way,

00:09:11.966 --> 00:09:15.798
I believe these photographs
begin to put a face on time.

00:09:16.703 --> 00:09:21.083
They embody a new
metaphysical visual reality.

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:25.750
When you spend 15 hours
looking at a place,

00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:29.124
you're going to see things
a little differently

00:09:29.148 --> 00:09:31.156
than if you or I walked up
with our camera,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.151
took a picture, and then walked away.

00:09:33.175 --> 00:09:34.766
This was a perfect example.

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:37.004
I call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie."

00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:39.445
I watched over 15 hours

00:09:39.469 --> 00:09:42.017
all these people
not even look at Sacré-Coeur.

00:09:42.041 --> 00:09:44.541
They were more interested
in using it as a backdrop.

00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:47.934
They would walk up, take a picture,

00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.644
and then walk away.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:54.659
And I found this to be an absolutely
extraordinary example,

00:09:55.239 --> 00:09:59.294
a powerful disconnect between
what we think the human experience is

00:09:59.723 --> 00:10:03.016
versus what the human experience
is evolving into.

00:10:03.922 --> 00:10:08.764
The act of sharing has suddenly
become more important

00:10:08.788 --> 00:10:10.683
than the experience itself.

00:10:11.416 --> 00:10:14.657
(Applause)

00:10:14.681 --> 00:10:17.817
And finally, my most recent image,

00:10:17.841 --> 00:10:21.111
which has such a special meaning
for me personally:

00:10:21.135 --> 00:10:24.579
this is the Serengeti National
Park in Tanzania.

00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:27.497
And this is photographed
in the middle of the Seronera,

00:10:27.521 --> 00:10:28.876
this is not a reserve.

00:10:29.532 --> 00:10:32.440
I went specifically during
the peak migration

00:10:32.464 --> 00:10:35.535
to hopefully capture
the most diverse range of animals.

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:38.083
Unfortunately, when we got there,

00:10:38.107 --> 00:10:40.687
there was a drought going on
during the peak migration,

00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:41.862
a five-week drought.

00:10:41.886 --> 00:10:44.479
So all the animals
were drawn to the water.

00:10:44.503 --> 00:10:46.744
I found this one watering hole,

00:10:46.768 --> 00:10:50.793
and felt if everything remained
the same way it was behaving,

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:54.301
I had a real opportunity
to capture something unique.

00:10:54.325 --> 00:10:56.130
We spent three days studying it,

00:10:56.154 --> 00:10:57.821
and nothing could have prepared me

00:10:57.845 --> 00:10:59.845
for what I witnessed during our shoot day.

00:11:00.438 --> 00:11:03.246
I photographed for 26 hours

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.682
in a sealed crocodile blind,
18 feet in the air.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.896
What I witnessed was unimaginable.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.174
Frankly, it was Biblical.

00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:13.546
We saw, for 26 hours,

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.800
all these competitive species
share a single resource called water.

00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:22.975
The same resource that humanity
is supposed to have wars over

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:24.633
during the next 50 years.

00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:28.737
The animals never even
grunted at each other.

00:11:29.515 --> 00:11:33.269
They seem to understand something
that we humans don't.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.455
That this precious resource called water

00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:38.586
is something we all have to share.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.310
When I created this picture,

00:11:43.222 --> 00:11:47.476
I realized that Day to Night
is really a new way of seeing,

00:11:48.127 --> 00:11:49.349
compressing time,

00:11:50.349 --> 00:11:53.524
exploring the space-time continuum
within a photograph.

00:11:54.809 --> 00:11:58.523
As technology evolves
along with photography,

00:11:59.229 --> 00:12:03.253
photographs will not only communicate
a deeper meaning of time and memory,

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:09.705
but they will compose a new narrative
of untold stories,

00:12:10.594 --> 00:12:14.554
creating a timeless window into our world.

00:12:15.285 --> 00:12:16.436
Thank you.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:23.126
(Applause)
