00:00:00.804 --> 00:00:05.216
What is it that French people
do better than all the others?

00:00:06.454 --> 00:00:08.380
If you would take polls,

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:10.211
the top three answers might be:

00:00:10.235 --> 00:00:14.274
love, wine and whining.

00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:15.599
(Laughter)

00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:16.782
Maybe.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.868
But let me suggest a fourth one:

00:00:19.892 --> 00:00:21.082
mathematics.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.613
Did you know that Paris
has more mathematicians

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:26.438
than any other city in the world?

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:29.295
And more streets
with mathematicians' names, too.

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:33.664
And if you look at the statistics
of the Fields Medal,

00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:36.181
often called the Nobel Prize
for mathematics,

00:00:36.205 --> 00:00:40.137
and always awarded to mathematicians
below the age of 40,

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:44.048
you will find that France has more
Fields medalists per inhabitant

00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:45.240
than any other country.

00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:49.240
What is it that we find so sexy in math?

00:00:50.153 --> 00:00:53.357
After all, it seems to be
dull and abstract,

00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:56.864
just numbers and computations
and rules to apply.

00:00:58.518 --> 00:01:00.630
Mathematics may be abstract,

00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:01.805
but it's not dull

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.558
and it's not about computing.

00:01:04.178 --> 00:01:05.925
It is about reasoning

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.209
and proving our core activity.

00:01:08.513 --> 00:01:10.035
It is about imagination,

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:12.078
the talent which we most praise.

00:01:12.102 --> 00:01:14.203
It is about finding the truth.

00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:18.350
There's nothing like the feeling
which invades you

00:01:18.374 --> 00:01:20.545
when after months of hard thinking,

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.867
you finally understand the right
reasoning to solve your problem.

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:28.618
The great mathematician
André Weil likened this --

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:29.793
no kidding --

00:01:29.817 --> 00:01:31.406
to sexual pleasure.

00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:37.538
But noted that this feeling
can last for hours, or even days.

00:01:38.804 --> 00:01:40.657
The reward may be big.

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:45.189
Hidden mathematical truths
permeate our whole physical world.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.350
They are inaccessible to our senses

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.098
but can be seen
through mathematical lenses.

00:01:52.092 --> 00:01:53.684
Close your eyes for moment

00:01:53.708 --> 00:01:57.183
and think of what is occurring
right now around you.

00:01:58.337 --> 00:02:01.830
Invisible particles from the air
around are bumping on you

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:04.587
by the billions and billions
at each second,

00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:06.674
all in complete chaos.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.200
And still,

00:02:08.224 --> 00:02:12.912
their statistics can be accurately
predicted by mathematical physics.

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:16.507
And open your eyes now

00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:19.841
to the statistics of the velocities
of these particles.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.750
The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve,

00:02:23.774 --> 00:02:25.955
or the Law of Errors --

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.701
of deviations with respect
to the mean behavior.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.852
This curve tells about the statistics
of velocities of particles

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:36.415
in the same way as a demographic curve

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.280
would tell about the statistics
of ages of individuals.

00:02:40.884 --> 00:02:43.534
It's one of the most
important curves ever.

00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:47.323
It keeps on occurring again and again,

00:02:47.347 --> 00:02:49.750
from many theories and many experiments,

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:53.055
as a great example of the universality

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.631
which is so dear to us mathematicians.

00:02:57.694 --> 00:02:58.921
Of this curve,

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:01.994
the famous scientist Francis Galton said,

00:03:02.018 --> 00:03:06.542
"It would have been deified by the Greeks
if they had known it.

00:03:07.064 --> 00:03:10.415
It is the supreme law of unreason."

00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:18.420
And there's no better way to materialize
that supreme goddess than Galton's Board.

00:03:19.774 --> 00:03:22.971
Inside this board are narrow tunnels

00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:27.623
through which tiny balls
will fall down randomly,

00:03:28.295 --> 00:03:33.682
going right or left, or left, etc.

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.390
All in complete randomness and chaos.

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:44.165
Let's see what happens when we look
at all these random trajectories together.

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:49.624
(Board shaking)

00:03:49.648 --> 00:03:52.492
This is a bit of a sport,

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:57.386
because we need to resolve
some traffic jams in there.

00:03:59.715 --> 00:04:00.865
Aha.

00:04:01.313 --> 00:04:04.900
We think that randomness
is going to play me a trick on stage.

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.072
There it is.

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:12.965
Our supreme goddess of unreason.

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.508
the Gauss Curve,

00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:20.984
trapped here inside this transparent box
as Dream in "The Sandman" comics.

00:04:22.623 --> 00:04:25.321
For you I have shown it,

00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:30.630
but to my students I explain why
it could not be any other curve.

00:04:31.128 --> 00:04:33.998
And this is touching
the mystery of that goddess,

00:04:34.022 --> 00:04:38.723
replacing a beautiful coincidence
by a beautiful explanation.

00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:41.360
All of science is like this.

00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:47.561
And beautiful mathematical explanations
are not only for our pleasure.

00:04:47.585 --> 00:04:50.245
They also change our vision of the world.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.277
For instance,

00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:53.451
Einstein,

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:54.626
Perrin,

00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:55.801
Smoluchowski,

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:59.385
they used the mathematical analysis
of random trajectories

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.446
and the Gauss Curve

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.398
to explain and prove that our
world is made of atoms.

00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:09.326
It was not the first time

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.740
that mathematics was revolutionizing
our view of the world.

00:05:13.555 --> 00:05:15.767
More than 2,000 years ago,

00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:18.401
at the time of the ancient Greeks,

00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:20.981
it already occurred.

00:05:21.827 --> 00:05:23.113
In those days,

00:05:23.137 --> 00:05:26.420
only a small fraction of the world
had been explored,

00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:29.486
and the Earth might have seemed infinite.

00:05:30.034 --> 00:05:31.801
But clever Eratosthenes,

00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:33.242
using mathematics,

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:38.377
was able to measure the Earth
with an amazing accuracy of two percent.

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.385
Here's another example.

00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:46.043
In 1673, Jean Richer noticed

00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:52.979
that a pendulum swings slightly
slower in Cayenne than in Paris.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.750
From this observation alone,
and clever mathematics,

00:05:58.774 --> 00:06:01.080
Newton rightly deduced

00:06:01.104 --> 00:06:06.645
that the Earth is a wee bit
flattened at the poles,

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.270
like 0.3 percent --

00:06:08.843 --> 00:06:13.256
so tiny that you wouldn't even
notice it on the real view of the Earth.

00:06:14.276 --> 00:06:18.204
These stories show that mathematics

00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:22.990
is able to make us go out of our intuition

00:06:23.512 --> 00:06:26.997
measure the Earth which seems infinite,

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:29.315
see atoms which are invisible

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:32.720
or detect an imperceptible
variation of shape.

00:06:32.744 --> 00:06:36.591
And if there is just one thing that you
should take home from this talk,

00:06:36.615 --> 00:06:37.809
it is this:

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:42.211
mathematics allows us
to go beyond the intuition

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:46.484
and explore territories
which do not fit within our grasp.

00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:50.608
Here's a modern example
you will all relate to:

00:06:51.362 --> 00:06:53.029
searching the Internet.

00:06:54.037 --> 00:06:55.379
The World Wide Web,

00:06:55.403 --> 00:06:57.207
more than one billion web pages --

00:06:57.231 --> 00:06:58.905
do you want to go through them all?

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.462
Computing power helps,

00:07:01.486 --> 00:07:04.672
but it would be useless without
the mathematical modeling

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:07.259
to find the information
hidden in the data.

00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:10.870
Let's work out a baby problem.

00:07:11.872 --> 00:07:15.679
Imagine that you're a detective
working on a crime case,

00:07:15.703 --> 00:07:19.491
and there are many people
who have their version of the facts.

00:07:20.032 --> 00:07:21.777
Who do you want to interview first?

00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:24.596
Sensible answer:

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.057
prime witnesses.

00:07:26.878 --> 00:07:28.112
You see,

00:07:28.136 --> 00:07:32.356
suppose that there is person number seven,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.531
tells you a story,

00:07:33.555 --> 00:07:35.569
but when you ask where he got if from,

00:07:35.593 --> 00:07:38.629
he points to person
number three as a source.

00:07:38.653 --> 00:07:40.721
And maybe person number three, in turn,

00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:44.441
points at person number one
as the primary source.

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:46.126
Now number one is a prime witness,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.388
so I definitely want
to interview him -- priority.

00:07:50.148 --> 00:07:51.299
And from the graph

00:07:51.323 --> 00:07:54.551
we also see that person
number four is a prime witness.

00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:57.018
And maybe I even want
to interview him first,

00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:59.401
because there are more
people who refer to him.

00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:03.018
OK, that was easy,

00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:08.288
but now what about if you have
a big bunch of people who will testify?

00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:10.216
And this graph,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.859
I may think of it as all people
who testify in a complicated crime case,

00:08:15.883 --> 00:08:19.905
but it may just as well be web pages
pointing to each other,

00:08:19.929 --> 00:08:22.000
referring to each other for contents.

00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:25.214
Which ones are the most authoritative?

00:08:25.587 --> 00:08:26.921
Not so clear.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.991
Enter PageRank,

00:08:30.015 --> 00:08:32.551
one of the early cornerstones of Google.

00:08:33.337 --> 00:08:37.579
This algorithm uses the laws
of mathematical randomness

00:08:37.603 --> 00:08:41.460
to determine automatically
the most relevant web pages,

00:08:41.484 --> 00:08:46.546
in the same way as we used randomness
in the Galton Board experiment.

00:08:47.341 --> 00:08:49.682
So let's send into this graph

00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:52.556
a bunch of tiny, digital marbles

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.329
and let them go randomly
through the graph.

00:08:56.353 --> 00:08:58.020
Each time they arrive at some site,

00:08:58.044 --> 00:09:02.210
they will go out through some link
chosen at random to the next one.

00:09:02.234 --> 00:09:03.987
And again, and again, and again.

00:09:04.358 --> 00:09:05.986
And with small, growing piles,

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.763
we'll keep the record of how many
times each site has been visited

00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:11.732
by these digital marbles.

00:09:12.243 --> 00:09:13.394
Here we go.

00:09:13.418 --> 00:09:15.266
Randomness, randomness.

00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:17.259
And from time to time,

00:09:17.283 --> 00:09:21.235
also let's make jumps completely
randomly to increase the fun.

00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:23.687
And look at this:

00:09:24.358 --> 00:09:27.143
from the chaos will emerge the solution.

00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:29.968
The highest piles
correspond to those sites

00:09:29.992 --> 00:09:33.503
which somehow are better
connected than the others,

00:09:33.527 --> 00:09:35.800
more pointed at than the others.

00:09:35.824 --> 00:09:37.546
And here we see clearly

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.602
which are the web pages
we want to first try.

00:09:41.507 --> 00:09:42.658
Once again,

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:45.142
the solution emerges from the randomness.

00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:48.026
Of course, since that time,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.757
Google has come up with much more
sophisticated algorithms,

00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:54.061
but already this was beautiful.

00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:56.457
And still,

00:09:56.481 --> 00:09:58.092
just one problem in a million.

00:09:58.734 --> 00:10:01.004
With the advent of digital area,

00:10:01.028 --> 00:10:06.044
more and more problems lend
themselves to mathematical analysis,

00:10:06.068 --> 00:10:10.433
making the job of mathematician
a more and more useful one,

00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:13.888
to the extent that a few years ago,

00:10:13.912 --> 00:10:17.691
it was ranked number one
among hundreds of jobs

00:10:17.715 --> 00:10:21.683
in a study about the best and worst jobs

00:10:21.707 --> 00:10:24.682
published by the Wall Street
Journal in 2009.

00:10:25.445 --> 00:10:27.297
Mathematician --

00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:28.754
best job in the world.

00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:32.714
That's because of the applications:

00:10:32.738 --> 00:10:34.877
communication theory,

00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:36.721
information theory,

00:10:36.745 --> 00:10:38.005
game theory,

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:39.475
compressed sensing,

00:10:39.499 --> 00:10:41.061
machine learning,

00:10:41.085 --> 00:10:42.652
graph analysis,

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:44.418
harmonic analysis.

00:10:44.442 --> 00:10:47.082
And why not stochastic processes,

00:10:47.106 --> 00:10:48.736
linear programming,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.788
or fluid simulation?

00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:55.187
Each of these fields have
monster industrial applications.

00:10:55.211 --> 00:10:56.362
And through them,

00:10:56.386 --> 00:10:58.385
there is big money in mathematics.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.440
And let me concede

00:11:01.464 --> 00:11:03.941
that when it comes to making
money from the math,

00:11:03.965 --> 00:11:07.789
the Americans are by a long shot
the world champions,

00:11:07.813 --> 00:11:12.432
with clever, emblematic billionaires
and amazing, giant companies,

00:11:12.456 --> 00:11:15.736
all resting, ultimately,
on good algorithm.

00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:21.063
Now with all this beauty,
usefulness and wealth,

00:11:21.087 --> 00:11:23.371
mathematics does look more sexy.

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:26.016
But don't you think

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.160
that the life a mathematical
researcher is an easy one.

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:33.700
It is filled with perplexity,

00:11:34.347 --> 00:11:35.497
frustration,

00:11:36.172 --> 00:11:38.617
a desperate fight for understanding.

00:11:39.955 --> 00:11:42.095
Let me evoke for you

00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:46.499
one of the most striking days
in my mathematician's life.

00:11:46.523 --> 00:11:47.674
Or should I say,

00:11:47.698 --> 00:11:49.435
one of the most striking nights.

00:11:50.713 --> 00:11:51.864
At that time,

00:11:51.888 --> 00:11:55.039
I was staying at the Institute
for Advanced Studies in Princeton --

00:11:55.063 --> 00:11:57.202
for many years, the home
of Albert Einstein

00:11:57.226 --> 00:12:01.654
and arguably the most holy place
for mathematical research in the world.

00:12:02.878 --> 00:12:06.722
And that night I was working
and working on an elusive proof,

00:12:06.746 --> 00:12:08.124
which was incomplete.

00:12:09.304 --> 00:12:11.512
It was all about understanding

00:12:11.536 --> 00:12:15.359
the paradoxical stability
property of plasmas,

00:12:15.383 --> 00:12:17.341
which are a crowd of electrons.

00:12:18.423 --> 00:12:21.159
In the perfect world of plasma,

00:12:21.183 --> 00:12:22.961
there are no collisions

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:26.643
and no friction to provide
the stability like we are used to.

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:28.543
But still,

00:12:28.567 --> 00:12:31.600
if you slightly perturb
a plasma equilibrium,

00:12:31.624 --> 00:12:34.312
you will find that the
resulting electric field

00:12:34.336 --> 00:12:36.675
spontaneously vanishes,

00:12:36.699 --> 00:12:38.674
or damps out,

00:12:38.698 --> 00:12:41.992
as if by some mysterious friction force.

00:12:42.728 --> 00:12:44.563
This paradoxical effect,

00:12:44.587 --> 00:12:46.064
called the Landau damping,

00:12:46.088 --> 00:12:49.077
is one of the most important
in plasma physics,

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:52.103
and it was discovered
through mathematical ideas.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.121
But still,

00:12:54.145 --> 00:12:58.375
a full mathematical understanding
of this phenomenon was missing.

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:03.185
And together with my former student
and main collaborator Clément Mouhot,

00:13:03.209 --> 00:13:04.701
in Paris at the time,

00:13:04.725 --> 00:13:08.811
we had been working for months
and months on such a proof.

00:13:09.832 --> 00:13:11.167
Actually,

00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:15.937
I had already announced by mistake
that we could solve it.

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.686
But the truth is,

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.857
the proof was just not working.

00:13:20.196 --> 00:13:24.545
In spite of more than 100 pages
of complicated, mathematical arguments,

00:13:24.569 --> 00:13:26.259
and a bunch discoveries,

00:13:26.283 --> 00:13:27.550
and huge calculation,

00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:28.743
it was not working.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.971
And that night in Princeton,

00:13:30.995 --> 00:13:35.296
a certain gap in the chain of arguments
was driving me crazy.

00:13:35.658 --> 00:13:40.251
I was putting in there all my energy
and experience and tricks,

00:13:40.275 --> 00:13:42.017
and still nothing was working.

00:13:42.553 --> 00:13:46.435
1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:47.767
not working.

00:13:48.545 --> 00:13:52.866
Around 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits.

00:13:53.915 --> 00:13:56.375
Then a few hours later,

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:57.550
waking up and go,

00:13:57.574 --> 00:14:00.931
"Ah, it's time to get
the kids to school --"

00:14:00.955 --> 00:14:02.106
What is this?

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.272
There was this voice in my head, I swear.

00:14:04.894 --> 00:14:06.807
"Take the second term to the other side,

00:14:06.831 --> 00:14:08.750
Fourier transform and invert in L2."

00:14:09.257 --> 00:14:10.408
(Laughter)

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:12.134
Damn it,

00:14:12.158 --> 00:14:14.271
that was the start of the solution!

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:16.670
You see,

00:14:16.694 --> 00:14:18.977
I thought I had taken some rest,

00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:22.389
but really my brain had
continued to work on it.

00:14:23.008 --> 00:14:24.605
In those moments,

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:27.230
you don't think of your career
or your colleagues,

00:14:27.254 --> 00:14:30.944
it's just a complete battle
between the problem and you.

00:14:32.098 --> 00:14:33.426
That being said,

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.399
it does not harm when you do get
a promotion in reward for your hard work.

00:14:37.808 --> 00:14:42.968
And after we completed our huge
analysis of the Landau damping,

00:14:42.992 --> 00:14:44.607
I was lucky enough

00:14:44.631 --> 00:14:47.661
to get the most coveted Fields Medal

00:14:47.685 --> 00:14:50.552
from the hands of the President of India,

00:14:50.576 --> 00:14:54.496
in Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 --

00:14:55.453 --> 00:14:58.704
an honor that mathematicians
never dare to dream,

00:14:58.728 --> 00:15:01.127
a day that I will remember until I live.

00:15:02.366 --> 00:15:03.813
What do you think,

00:15:03.837 --> 00:15:05.978
on such an occasion?

00:15:06.002 --> 00:15:07.152
Pride, yes?

00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:11.431
And gratitude to the many collaborators
who made this possible.

00:15:12.304 --> 00:15:14.516
And because it was a collective adventure,

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.682
you need to share it,
not just with your collaborators.

00:15:19.548 --> 00:15:25.240
I believe that everybody can appreciate
the thrill of mathematical research,

00:15:25.264 --> 00:15:29.582
and share the passionate stories
of humans and ideas behind it.

00:15:30.494 --> 00:15:35.268
And I've been working with my staff
at Institut Henri Poincaré,

00:15:35.292 --> 00:15:40.473
together with partners and artists
of mathematical communication worldwide,

00:15:40.497 --> 00:15:45.084
so that we can found our own,
very special museum of mathematics there.

00:15:46.537 --> 00:15:48.314
So in a few years,

00:15:48.885 --> 00:15:50.462
when you come to Paris,

00:15:50.486 --> 00:15:56.144
after tasting the great, crispy
baguette and macaroon,

00:15:56.168 --> 00:15:59.831
please come and visit us
at Institut Henri Poincaré,

00:15:59.856 --> 00:16:02.371
and share the mathematical dream with us.

00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:03.546
Thank you.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:10.570
(Applause)
