WEBVTT

00:00:00.878 --> 00:00:04.403
The world is filled
with incredible objects

00:00:04.427 --> 00:00:06.355
and rich cultural heritage.

00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:09.419
And when we get access to them,

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:11.827
we are blown away, we fall in love.

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:14.249
But most of the time,

00:00:14.273 --> 00:00:19.065
the world's population is living
without real access to arts and culture.

00:00:19.946 --> 00:00:25.299
What might the connections be
when we start exploring our heritage,

00:00:25.323 --> 00:00:28.530
the beautiful locations
and the art in this world?

00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:32.201
Before we get started
in this presentation,

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:35.200
I just want to take care
of a few housekeeping points.

00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:38.999
First, I am no expert in art or culture.

00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:41.749
I fell into this by mistake,
but I'm loving it.

00:00:42.356 --> 00:00:45.352
Secondly, all of what
I'm going to show you

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:49.341
belongs to the amazing museums,
archives and foundations

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:50.791
that we partner with.

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:52.671
None of this belongs to Google.

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:56.424
And finally, what you see behind me

00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:59.799
is available right now
on your mobile phones,

00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:00.997
on your laptops.

00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:03.425
This is our current platform,
where you can explore

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.860
thousands of museums
and objects at your fingertips,

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:09.395
in extremely high-definition detail.

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:12.312
The diversity of the content
is what's amazing.

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:14.505
If we just had European paintings,

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:16.260
if we just had modern art,

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.086
I think it gets a bit boring.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.969
For example, this month,
we launched the "Black History" channel

00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:24.582
with 82 curated exhibitions,

00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:28.172
which talk about arts and culture
in that community.

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:31.819
We also have some
amazing objects from Japan,

00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:35.947
centered around craftsmanship,
called "Made in Japan."

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:39.098
And one of my favorite exhibitions,

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:41.527
which actually is the idea of my talk,

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:45.414
is -- I didn't expect to become
a fan of Japanese dolls.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.602
But I am, thanks to this exhibition,

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:52.111
that has really taught me
about the craftsmanship

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:54.257
behind the soul of a Japanese doll.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:56.509
Trust me, it's very exciting.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.881
Take my word for it.

00:01:57.905 --> 00:01:59.914
So, moving on swiftly.

00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:02.770
One quick thing I wanted
to showcase in this platform,

00:02:02.794 --> 00:02:05.729
which you can share with your kids
and your friends right now,

00:02:05.753 --> 00:02:10.009
is you can travel to all these
amazing institutions virtually, as well.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.619
One of our recent ideas was with
The Guggenheim Museum in New York,

00:02:13.643 --> 00:02:17.001
where you can get a taste
of what it might feel like

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:18.176
to actually be there.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.967
You can go to the ground floor

00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:22.680
and obviously, most of you,
I assume, have been there.

00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:25.441
And you can see the architectural
masterpiece that it is.

00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:28.559
But imagine this accessibility
for a kid in Bombay

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:30.303
who's studying architecture,

00:02:30.327 --> 00:02:33.382
who hasn't had a chance
to go to The Guggenheim as yet.

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:36.491
You can obviously look at objects
in the Guggenheim Museum,

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:39.233
you can obviously get into them
and so on and so forth.

00:02:39.257 --> 00:02:41.132
There's a lot of information here.

00:02:41.156 --> 00:02:45.005
But this is not the purpose
of my talk today.

00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:47.309
This exists right now.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:51.259
What we now have are the building blocks
to a very exciting future,

00:02:51.283 --> 00:02:52.998
when it comes to arts and culture

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:55.633
and accessibility to arts and culture.

00:02:55.657 --> 00:03:00.125
So I am joined today onstage
by my good friend and artist in residence

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.492
at our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne,

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.645
who is the professor of interactive design

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.306
at ECAL University
in Lausanne, Switzerland.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.944
What Cyril and our team
of engineers have been doing

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:13.103
is trying to find these connections
and visualize a few of these.

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:14.940
So I'm going to go quite quick now.

00:03:14.964 --> 00:03:18.566
This object you see
behind me -- oh, just clarification:

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.541
Always, seeing the real thing is better.

00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:23.428
In case people think
I'm trying to replicate the real thing.

00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:24.659
So, moving on.

00:03:25.155 --> 00:03:28.671
This object you see behind me
is the Venus of Berekhat Ram.

00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:30.771
It's one of the oldest
objects in the world,

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:33.969
found in the Golan Heights
around 233,000 years ago,

00:03:33.993 --> 00:03:37.122
and currently residing
at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:39.767
It is also one of the oldest
objects on our platform.

00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:41.668
So let's zoom.

00:03:41.692 --> 00:03:43.457
We start from this one object.

00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:46.522
What if we zoomed out

00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:51.052
and actually tried to experience
our own cultural big bang?

00:03:51.076 --> 00:03:52.654
What might that look like?

00:03:53.474 --> 00:03:57.131
This is what we deal with on a daily basis
at the Cultural Institute --

00:03:57.155 --> 00:04:02.117
over six million cultural artifacts
curated and given to us by institutions,

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.087
to actually make these connections.

00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:05.510
You can travel through time,

00:04:05.534 --> 00:04:09.045
you can understand more
about our society through these.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.469
You can look at it
from the perspective of our planet,

00:04:13.493 --> 00:04:16.128
and try to see how
it might look without borders,

00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:18.823
if we just organized art and culture.

00:04:18.847 --> 00:04:21.075
We can also then plot it by time,

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.179
which obviously, for the data geek
in me, is very fascinating.

00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:28.589
You can spend hours
looking at every decade

00:04:28.613 --> 00:04:31.929
and the contributions
in that decade and in those years

00:04:31.953 --> 00:04:34.286
for art, history and cultures.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.689
We would love to spend hours
showing you each and every decade,

00:04:37.713 --> 00:04:39.574
but we don't have the time right now.

00:04:39.598 --> 00:04:42.857
So you can go on your phone
and actually do it yourself.

00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.343
(Applause)

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:49.469
But if you don't mind
and can hold your applause till later,

00:04:49.493 --> 00:04:51.041
I don't want to run out of time,

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:53.264
because I want to show you
a lot of cool stuff.

00:04:53.288 --> 00:04:54.788
So, just very quickly:

00:04:54.812 --> 00:04:58.798
you can move on from here
to another very interesting idea.

00:04:58.822 --> 00:05:00.533
Beyond the pretty picture,

00:05:00.557 --> 00:05:02.346
beyond the nice visualization,

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.697
what is the purpose, how is this useful?

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:09.450
This next idea comes
from discussions with curators

00:05:09.474 --> 00:05:11.109
that we've been having at museums,

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:13.156
who, by the way, I've fallen in love with,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.374
because they dedicate their whole life
to try to tell these stories.

00:05:16.398 --> 00:05:19.329
One of the curators told me,
"Amit, what would it be like

00:05:19.353 --> 00:05:21.832
if you could create
a virtual curator's table

00:05:21.856 --> 00:05:24.159
where all these six million objects

00:05:24.183 --> 00:05:28.586
are displayed in a way for us
to look at the connections between them?"

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.639
You can spend a lot of time, trust me,
looking at different objects

00:05:32.663 --> 00:05:34.616
and understanding where they come from.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.848
It's a crazy Matrix experience.

00:05:36.872 --> 00:05:37.886
(Laughter)

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.196
Just moving on,

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.391
let's take the world-famous
Vincent Van Gogh,

00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:46.130
who is very well-represented
on this platform.

00:05:46.154 --> 00:05:48.930
Thanks to the diversity
of the institutions we have,

00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:54.658
we have over 211 high-definition,
amazing artworks by this artist,

00:05:54.682 --> 00:05:58.429
now organized in one beautiful view.

00:05:58.453 --> 00:06:01.426
And as it resolves,
and as Cyril goes deeper,

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.659
you can see all the self-portraits,

00:06:03.683 --> 00:06:05.108
you can see still life.

00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:07.735
But I just wanted to highlight
one very quick example,

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.447
which is very timely:

00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.782
"The Bedroom."

00:06:10.806 --> 00:06:13.107
This is an artwork
where three copies exist --

00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:15.461
one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:17.472
one at the Orsay in Paris

00:06:17.496 --> 00:06:19.430
and one at the Art Institute of Chicago,

00:06:19.454 --> 00:06:21.957
which, actually, currently
is hosting a reunion

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.756
of all three artworks physically,

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.917
I think only for the second time ever.

00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:30.860
But, it is united digitally and virtually
for anybody to look at

00:06:30.884 --> 00:06:32.805
in a very different way,

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:35.862
and you won't get pushed
in the line in the crowd.

00:06:35.886 --> 00:06:40.628
So let's take you and let's travel
through "The Bedroom" very quickly,

00:06:40.652 --> 00:06:44.239
so you can experience what we are doing
for every single object.

00:06:44.263 --> 00:06:47.714
We want the image to speak
as much as it can

00:06:47.738 --> 00:06:49.382
on a digital platform.

00:06:49.406 --> 00:06:52.553
And all you need is an internet
connection and a computer

00:06:52.577 --> 00:06:56.915
(Applause)

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:59.497
And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.

00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:01.005
I'm sorry, this is all live,

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:03.464
so you have to give Cyril
a little bit of --

00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:06.461
and this is available for every object:

00:07:06.485 --> 00:07:09.200
modern art, contemporary art,
Renaissance -- you name it,

00:07:09.224 --> 00:07:10.411
even sculpture.

00:07:11.802 --> 00:07:15.397
Sometimes, you don't know
what can attract you

00:07:15.421 --> 00:07:20.649
to an artwork or to a museum
or to a cultural discovery.

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:23.415
So for me, personally,
it was quite a challenge

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:26.661
because when I decided to make this
my full-time job at Google,

00:07:26.685 --> 00:07:29.288
my mother was not very supportive.

00:07:29.312 --> 00:07:30.559
I love my mother,

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:33.582
but she thought I was wasting my life
with this museum stuff.

00:07:33.606 --> 00:07:36.918
And for her, a museum is what
you do when you go on vacation

00:07:36.942 --> 00:07:38.909
and you tick-mark and it's over, right?

00:07:38.933 --> 00:07:41.464
And it took around four and a half years

00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:43.702
for me to convince my lovely Indian mother

00:07:43.726 --> 00:07:45.379
that actually, this is worthwhile.

00:07:45.403 --> 00:07:48.844
And the way I did it was,
I realized one day that she loves gold.

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:54.443
So I started showing her all objects
that have the material gold in them.

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:57.118
And the first thing my mom asks me is,

00:07:57.142 --> 00:07:59.570
"How can we buy these?"

00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:01.412
(Laughter)

00:08:01.436 --> 00:08:04.578
And obviously, my salary is not that high,

00:08:04.602 --> 00:08:06.980
so I was like, "We can't
actually do that, mom.

00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:09.115
But you can explore them virtually."

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:12.558
And so now my mom -- every time
I meet her, she asks me,

00:08:12.582 --> 00:08:16.048
"Any more gold, any more silver
in your project? Can you show me?"

00:08:16.072 --> 00:08:18.246
And that's the idea
I'm trying to illustrate.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.408
It does not matter how you get in,

00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:21.794
as long as you get in.

00:08:21.818 --> 00:08:23.428
Once you get in, you're hooked.

00:08:23.452 --> 00:08:25.801
Moving on from here very quickly,

00:08:25.825 --> 00:08:28.674
there is kind of a playful idea, actually,

00:08:28.698 --> 00:08:30.333
to illustrate the point of access,

00:08:30.357 --> 00:08:32.779
and I'm going to go
quite quickly on this one.

00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:38.210
We all know that seeing the artwork
in person is amazing.

00:08:38.234 --> 00:08:40.817
But we also know
that most of us can't do it,

00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:43.599
and the ones that can afford
to do it, it's complicated.

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:47.430
So -- Cyril, can we load
up our art trip, what do we call it?

00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:49.216
We don't have a good name for this.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.211
But essentially, we have
around 1,000 amazing institutions,

00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:55.402
68 countries.

00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:57.126
But let's start with Rembrandt.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.392
We might have time for only one example.

00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:01.645
But thanks to the diversity,

00:09:01.669 --> 00:09:05.573
we've got around 500 amazing
Rembrandt object artworks

00:09:05.597 --> 00:09:07.866
from 46 institutions and 17 countries.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.442
Let's say that on your next vacation,

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:12.516
you want to go see
every single one of them.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.874
That is your itinerary,

00:09:13.898 --> 00:09:17.552
you will probably travel
53,000 kilometers,

00:09:17.576 --> 00:09:20.163
visit around, I think, 46 institutions,

00:09:20.187 --> 00:09:24.378
and just FYI, you might release
10 tons of CO2 emissions.

00:09:24.402 --> 00:09:25.865
(Laughter)

00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:27.362
But remember, it's art,

00:09:27.386 --> 00:09:30.051
so you can justify it,
perhaps, in some way.

00:09:30.837 --> 00:09:32.759
Moving on swiftly from here,

00:09:32.783 --> 00:09:35.718
is something a little bit
more technical and more interesting.

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:40.679
All that we've shown you so far
uses metadata to make the connections.

00:09:40.703 --> 00:09:42.813
But obviously we have
something cool nowadays

00:09:42.837 --> 00:09:45.749
that everyone likes to talk about,
which is machine learning.

00:09:45.773 --> 00:09:48.847
So what we thought is,
let's strip out all the metadata,

00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:52.483
let's look at what machine learning can do

00:09:52.507 --> 00:09:56.830
based purely on visual recognition
of this entire collection.

00:09:56.854 --> 00:10:01.047
What we ended up with
is this very interesting map,

00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:05.381
these clusters that have
no reference point information,

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:09.370
but has just used visuals
to cluster things together.

00:10:09.394 --> 00:10:12.976
Each cluster is an art to us
by itself of discovery.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.663
But one of the clusters we want
to show you very quickly

00:10:15.687 --> 00:10:18.339
is this amazing cluster of portraits

00:10:18.363 --> 00:10:20.765
that we found from museums
around the world.

00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:22.972
If you could zoom in
a little bit more, Cyril.

00:10:22.996 --> 00:10:26.828
Just to show you, you can
just travel through portraits.

00:10:26.852 --> 00:10:29.626
And essentially, you can do nature,
you can do horses

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.406
and clusters galore.

00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:33.857
When we saw all these portraits,

00:10:33.881 --> 00:10:37.533
we were like, "Hey, can we do
something fun for kids,

00:10:37.557 --> 00:10:39.239
or can we do something playful

00:10:39.263 --> 00:10:41.288
to get people interested in portraits?"

00:10:41.312 --> 00:10:43.492
Because I haven't really seen

00:10:43.516 --> 00:10:46.883
young kids really excited
to go to a portrait gallery.

00:10:47.357 --> 00:10:49.289
I wanted to try to figure something out.

00:10:49.313 --> 00:10:51.780
So we created something
called the portrait matcher.

00:10:51.804 --> 00:10:53.121
It's quite self-explanatory,

00:10:53.145 --> 00:10:55.883
so I'm just going to let Cyril
show his beautiful face.

00:10:55.907 --> 00:11:00.039
And essentially what's happening is,
with the movement of his head,

00:11:00.063 --> 00:11:04.230
we are matching different portraits
around the world from museums.

00:11:04.254 --> 00:11:06.450
(Applause)

00:11:17.445 --> 00:11:19.151
And I don't know about you,

00:11:19.175 --> 00:11:21.191
but I've shown it to my nephew and sister,

00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:23.064
and the reaction is just phenomenal.

00:11:23.088 --> 00:11:25.794
All they ask me is,
"When can we go see this?"

00:11:27.492 --> 00:11:29.065
And by the way, if we're nice,

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:31.910
maybe, Cyril, you can smile
and find a happy one?

00:11:32.696 --> 00:11:34.094
Oh, perfect.

00:11:34.118 --> 00:11:36.106
By the way, this is not rehearsed.

00:11:36.474 --> 00:11:39.054
Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow.

00:11:39.078 --> 00:11:42.554
OK, let's move on; otherwise,
this will just take the whole time.

00:11:42.578 --> 00:11:44.296
(Applause)

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.900
So, art and culture
can be fun also, right?

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.297
For our last quick experiment --

00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:53.084
we call all of these "experiments" --

00:11:53.108 --> 00:11:55.997
our last quick experiment
comes back to machine learning.

00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:58.862
We show you clusters, visual clusters,

00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:03.787
but what if we could ask the machine
to also name these clusters?

00:12:03.811 --> 00:12:08.564
What if it could automatically tag
them, using no actual metadata?

00:12:08.588 --> 00:12:12.688
So what we have is this kind of explorer,

00:12:12.712 --> 00:12:16.323
where we have managed to match,
I think, around 4,000 labels.

00:12:16.347 --> 00:12:19.511
And we haven't really
done anything special here,

00:12:19.535 --> 00:12:21.193
just fed the collection.

00:12:21.217 --> 00:12:22.987
And we found interesting categories.

00:12:23.011 --> 00:12:25.916
We can start with horses,
a very straightforward category.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.239
You would expect to see
that the machine has put

00:12:28.263 --> 00:12:30.004
images of horses, right?

00:12:30.028 --> 00:12:33.470
And it has, but you also notice,
right over there,

00:12:33.494 --> 00:12:35.573
that it has a very abstract image

00:12:35.597 --> 00:12:38.792
that it has still managed to recognize
and cluster as horses.

00:12:38.816 --> 00:12:42.506
We also have an amazing head
in terms of a horse.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.532
And each one has the tags
as to why it got categorized in this.

00:12:46.556 --> 00:12:50.530
So let's move to another one
which I found very funny and interesting,

00:12:50.554 --> 00:12:53.045
because I don't understand
how this category came up.

00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:54.819
It's called "Lady in Waiting."

00:12:54.843 --> 00:12:57.455
If, Cyril, you do it very quickly,

00:12:57.479 --> 00:13:01.021
you will see that we have
these amazing images

00:13:01.045 --> 00:13:03.806
of ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.276
I don't really understand it.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.540
But I've been trying to ask
my museum contacts,

00:13:07.564 --> 00:13:09.809
you know, "What is this?
What's going on here?"

00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:11.445
And it's fascinating.

00:13:11.469 --> 00:13:14.158
Coming back to gold very quickly,

00:13:14.182 --> 00:13:15.745
I wanted to search for gold

00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:17.871
and see how the machine
tagged all the gold.

00:13:17.895 --> 00:13:19.975
But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.835
We are living in popular times.

00:13:21.859 --> 00:13:23.962
It tags it as "bling-bling."

00:13:23.986 --> 00:13:25.800
(Laughter)

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.121
I'm being hard on Cyril,
because I'm moving too fast.

00:13:30.145 --> 00:13:32.772
Essentially, here you have
all the bling-bling

00:13:32.796 --> 00:13:35.957
of the world's museums organized for you.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:39.497
And finally, to end this talk
and these experiments,

00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:42.838
what I hope you feel after this talk
is happiness and emotion.

00:13:42.862 --> 00:13:45.301
And what would we see
when we see happiness?

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:48.484
If we actually look at all the objects

00:13:48.508 --> 00:13:50.452
that have been tagged under "happiness,"

00:13:50.476 --> 00:13:53.540
you would expect happiness, I guess.

00:13:53.564 --> 00:13:59.667
But there was one that came up
that was very fascinating and interesting,

00:13:59.691 --> 00:14:04.066
which was this artwork
by Douglas Coupland,

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.185
our friend and artist
in residence as well,

00:14:06.209 --> 00:14:08.470
called, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain."

00:14:08.494 --> 00:14:12.109
I don't know why the machine feels like
it misses its pre-Internet brain

00:14:12.133 --> 00:14:13.403
and it's been tagged here,

00:14:13.427 --> 00:14:15.341
but it's a very interesting thought.

00:14:15.365 --> 00:14:17.548
I sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain,

00:14:17.572 --> 00:14:20.572
but not when it comes to exploring
arts and culture online.

00:14:20.596 --> 00:14:22.909
So take out your phones,
take out your computers,

00:14:22.933 --> 00:14:24.090
go visit museums.

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:26.793
And just a quick call-out
to all the amazing archivists,

00:14:26.817 --> 00:14:28.201
historians, curators,

00:14:28.225 --> 00:14:30.997
who are sitting in museums,
preserving all this culture.

00:14:31.021 --> 00:14:34.339
And the least we can do is get
our daily dose of art and culture

00:14:34.363 --> 00:14:35.694
for ourselves and our kids.

00:14:35.718 --> 00:14:36.871
Thank you.

00:14:36.895 --> 00:14:47.536
(Applause)
