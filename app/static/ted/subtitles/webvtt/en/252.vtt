00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
One way to change our genes is to make new ones,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Another is to change our lifestyles.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
can actually be measured now.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This was figured out by Robin Williams

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a few years before the rest of us.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, there's some things that you can do

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to make your brain grow new brain cells.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Some of my favorite things, like chocolate and tea, blueberries,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
alcohol in moderation, stress management

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and cannabinoids found in marijuana.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm just the messenger.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
(Laughter)

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What were we just talking about?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
(Laughter)

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And other things that can make it worse,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that can cause you to lose brain cells.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The usual suspects, like saturated fat and sugar,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
nicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stress.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Your heart gets more blood flow.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
after only a year become measurably less clogged.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the blue means no blood flow.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
of early prostate cancer and, by extension, breast cancer,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
simply by making these changes.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
70 percent in the group that made these changes,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
whereas only nine percent in the comparison group.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
These differences were highly significant.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Even your sexual organs get more blood flow,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so you increase sexual potency.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
by the Department of Health Services,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
showing that nicotine, which constricts your arteries,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
can cause a heart attack or a stroke,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but it also causes impotence.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Half of guys who smoke are impotent.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
How sexy is that?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now we're also about to publish a study --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is what's called a heat map --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and the different colors -- and along the side, on the right, are different genes.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in effect, turning on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
turning off the disease-promoting genes.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And so these findings I think are really very powerful,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
giving many people new hope and new choices.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that are giving you your genetic profiles,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
are giving some people a sense of, "Gosh, well, what can I do about it?"

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Well, our genes are not our fate, and if we make these changes --

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
they're a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
than we might have made otherwise,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
we can actually change how our genes are expressed.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Thank you.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
(Applause)
