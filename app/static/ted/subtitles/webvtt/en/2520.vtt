00:00:00.891 --> 00:00:03.689
Have you ever been asked
by your Chinese friend,

00:00:03.713 --> 00:00:05.368
"What is your zodiac sign?"

00:00:05.947 --> 00:00:08.432
Don't think they are making small talk.

00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:10.383
If you say, "I'm a Monkey,"

00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:11.766
they immediately know

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.186
you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.216
(Laughter)

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.798
Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way
of asking your age.

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:24.505
By revealing your zodiac sign,
you are also being evaluated.

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.569
Judgments are being made
about your fortune or misfortune,

00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:30.971
your personality, career prospects

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:32.963
and how you will do in a given year.

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:36.218
If you share you and your
partner's animal signs,

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:40.061
they will paint a picture in their mind
about your private life.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:43.348
Maybe you don't believe
in the Chinese zodiac.

00:00:43.372 --> 00:00:47.203
As a quarter of the world population
is influenced by it,

00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:49.626
you'd be wise to do something about that.

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:53.404
So what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly?

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:57.187
Most Westerners think
of Greco-Roman zodiac,

00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:59.434
the signs divided into 12 months.

00:00:59.973 --> 00:01:01.924
The Chinese zodiac is different.

00:01:01.948 --> 00:01:05.126
It's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.726
starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.092
and has no association
with constellations.

00:01:11.663 --> 00:01:16.512
For example, if you were born
in 1975, you are a Rabbit.

00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:19.174
Can you see your zodiac sign there?

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:25.424
Our Chinese ancestors constructed
a very complicated theoretical framework

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:30.089
based on yin and yang, the five elements
and the 12 zodiac animals.

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:32.281
Over thousands of years,

00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:36.777
this popular culture has affected
people's major decisions,

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:42.001
such as naming, marriage, giving birth
and attitude towards each other.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.279
And some of the implications
are quite amazing.

00:01:46.248 --> 00:01:50.578
The Chinese believe certain animals
get on better than the others.

00:01:51.147 --> 00:01:55.841
So parents choose specific years
to give birth to babies,

00:01:55.865 --> 00:02:00.787
because they believe the team effort
by the right combination of animals

00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:03.108
can give prosperity to families.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:08.179
We even refer to the zodiac
when entering into romantic relations.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.036
I'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance
with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits.

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:19.005
Chinese people believe some animals
are natural enemies.

00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:22.537
As a Pig, I need
to be careful with a Snake.

00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:24.910
Raise your hand if you are a Snake.

00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:27.259
Let's have a chat later.

00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:28.678
(Laughter)

00:02:28.702 --> 00:02:31.945
We believe some animals
are luckier than the others,

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.664
such as the Dragon.

00:02:33.688 --> 00:02:35.546
Unlike the Western tradition,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.154
the Chinese Dragon is a symbol
for power, strength and wealth.

00:02:40.178 --> 00:02:42.861
It's everyone's dream
to have a Dragon baby.

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.475
Jack Ma's parents
must have been very proud.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.061
And they are not the only ones.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.982
In 2012, the Year of the Dragon,

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:53.305
the birthrate in China,
Hong Kong and Taiwan

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.016
increased by five percent.

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:58.961
That means another
one million more babies.

00:03:00.497 --> 00:03:03.410
With a traditional
preference to baby boys,

00:03:03.434 --> 00:03:07.762
the boy-girl ratio that year
was 120 to 100.

00:03:08.431 --> 00:03:10.195
When those Dragon boys grow up,

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.625
they will face much more severe
competition in love and job markets.

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.583
According to the BBC and the Chinese
government's press release,

00:03:19.607 --> 00:03:24.811
January 2015 saw a peak
of Cesarean sections.

00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:26.004
Why?

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:30.137
That was the last month
for the Year of the Horse.

00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:32.763
It's not because they like horses so much,

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:36.256
it's because they try to avoid
having unlucky Goat babies.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.358
(Laughter)

00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:40.161
If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad.

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:41.915
Those are Goat babies.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.049
They don't look like losers to me.

00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:45.238
(Laughter)

00:03:45.262 --> 00:03:48.024
Tiger is another undesirable animal,

00:03:48.048 --> 00:03:49.856
due to its volatile temperament.

00:03:50.337 --> 00:03:54.190
Many Chinese regions
saw a sharp decline of birthrate

00:03:54.214 --> 00:03:55.411
during those years.

00:03:56.122 --> 00:03:59.792
Perhaps one should consider
zodiac in reverse,

00:03:59.816 --> 00:04:04.020
as those Tiger and Goat babies
will face much less competition.

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:05.766
Maybe they are the lucky ones.

00:04:08.055 --> 00:04:12.515
I went through the Forbes
top 300 richest people in the world,

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:14.572
and it's interesting to see

00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:18.174
the most undesirable two animals,
the Goat and Tiger,

00:04:18.198 --> 00:04:19.880
are at the top of the chart,

00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:22.327
even higher than the Dragon.

00:04:22.351 --> 00:04:24.471
So maybe we should consider,

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:27.648
maybe it's much better
to have less competition.

00:04:28.384 --> 00:04:30.405
One last but interesting point:

00:04:30.429 --> 00:04:33.262
many Chinese people make
their investment decisions

00:04:33.286 --> 00:04:35.603
based on the zodiac sign index.

00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:40.276
Although the belief and tradition
of the zodiac sign

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.138
has been over thousands of years,

00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:46.345
the trend of using it
in making major decisions

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:49.550
did not really happen
until the past few decades.

00:04:49.934 --> 00:04:54.330
Our ancestors were very busy
surviving poverty, drought,

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:58.004
famine, riot, disease and civil war.

00:04:58.028 --> 00:05:03.790
And finally, Chinese people
have the time, wealth and technology

00:05:03.814 --> 00:05:06.763
to create an ideal life
they've always wanted.

00:05:07.604 --> 00:05:11.251
The collective decision
made by 1.3 billion people

00:05:11.275 --> 00:05:15.826
has caused the fluctuation in economics
and demand on everything,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.425
from health care and education
to property and consumer goods.

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:26.066
As China plays such an important role
in the global economy and geopolitics,

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.199
the decisions made based on the zodiac
and other Chinese traditions

00:05:30.223 --> 00:05:33.693
end up impacting everyone
around the world.

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:36.663
Are there any Monkeys here?

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.610
2016 is the Year of the Monkey.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.929
Monkeys are clever, curious,
creative and mischievous.

00:05:46.953 --> 00:05:48.111
Thank you.

00:05:48.135 --> 00:05:51.271
(Applause)
