WEBVTT

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:06.143
I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female,

00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:07.431
like all of you.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:09.764
And I'm also a social justice comedian,

00:00:09.788 --> 00:00:12.103
something that I insist is an actual job.

00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:14.794
To explain what that is,
let me tell you how I got here.

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:16.573
I've performed all over the country.

00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:18.894
And let me tell you,
America is majestic, right?

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.643
It's got breathtaking nature,

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:21.817
waffle houses

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:23.824
and diabetes as far as the eye can see.

00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:25.760
It is really something.

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:28.023
Now, the American population
can be broken up

00:00:28.047 --> 00:00:29.588
into three main categories:

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.350
there's mostly wonderful people,

00:00:31.374 --> 00:00:32.525
haters

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.700
and Florida.

00:00:33.724 --> 00:00:35.307
(Laughter)

00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:38.645
Besides Florida, the most troubling
category here are the Haters.

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:40.858
They are a minority,

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:43.385
but they overcompensate
by being extra loud.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.718
They have the Napoleon complex
of demographics,

00:00:45.742 --> 00:00:47.810
and yes, some of the men do wear heels.

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:49.937
As a social justice comedian,

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:51.829
it's my goal to convert these haters,

00:00:51.853 --> 00:00:55.059
because they hate a lot of things,
which leads to negative outcomes,

00:00:55.083 --> 00:00:58.694
like racism, violence and Ted Nugent.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.282
This is not an exhaustive list;

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:02.980
I'm probably missing 3-7 items.

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:04.226
But the point is,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.979
we have to reckon with the haters.

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:07.814
But there's variance within this group

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:10.859
and it's not efficient to go
after all of them, right?

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:14.396
So what I've done is created
a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.143
I basically took all of the haters,

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:19.013
I put them in a petri dish,
like a scientist,

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.496
and this is what I found.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.671
(Laughter)

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:23.989
First off, we have the trolls.

00:01:24.013 --> 00:01:26.396
These are your garden-variety
digital haters.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.286
They're the people who quit their jobs

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.424
so they can post on YouTube
videos all day long.

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:34.109
There's also the drive-by haters.

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.425
Now, these people will be at a stoplight,

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:38.418
they'll wait for the light to turn green

00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:41.264
and when it does, they yell,
"Go back to your own country!"

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:44.505
Now back in the day, they would've
actually gotten out of their cars

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:45.821
and hated you to your face.

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:48.223
But they just don't make them
like they used to --

00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:50.532
which is another sign
of the decline in America.

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:51.730
(Laughter)

00:01:52.293 --> 00:01:53.444
The next category

00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:56.111
is the mission-oriented-bigot-
whose-group-affiliation-

00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:57.803
gives-them-cover-for-hating hater.

00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:01.365
These guys like to hate
via a seemingly nice organization,

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:03.562
like a church or a nonprofit,

00:02:03.586 --> 00:02:06.300
and they oftentimes like to speak
in an old-timey voice.

00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:10.864
But the group I'm most
interested in is the swing hater.

00:02:10.888 --> 00:02:14.475
The swing hater is sister
to the swing voter --

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.228
they just can't decide!

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:18.130
They're like ideological sluts

00:02:18.154 --> 00:02:20.144
who move from hating to not hating.

00:02:20.168 --> 00:02:22.923
And they do it because they don't have
enough information.

00:02:22.947 --> 00:02:25.925
This is the group I like to target
with social justice comedy.

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:27.259
Why comedy?

00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:29.812
Because on a scale of comedy to brochure,

00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:33.534
the average American prefers comedy,
as you can see from this graph.

00:02:33.558 --> 00:02:34.709
(Laughter)

00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:36.093
Comedy is very popular.

00:02:36.117 --> 00:02:37.268
And by the way,

00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:39.238
this is a mathematically accurate graph,

00:02:39.262 --> 00:02:40.786
generated from fake numbers.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.287
(Laughter)

00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:43.496
Now, the question is:

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.305
Why does social justice comedy work?

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.028
Because, first off, it makes you laugh.

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:52.214
And when you're laughing,
you enter into a state of openness.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.796
And in that moment of openness,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.484
a good social justice comedian
can stick in a whole bunch of information,

00:02:57.508 --> 00:02:59.038
and if they're really skilled,

00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:00.213
a rectal exam.

00:03:00.237 --> 00:03:02.770
(Laughter)

00:03:02.794 --> 00:03:05.995
Here are some ground rules
for social justice comedy:

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.978
first off, it's not partisan.

00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:10.543
This isn't political comedy,
this is about justice,

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:12.264
and no one is against justice.

00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:14.281
Two, it's inviting and warm,

00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:17.066
it makes you feel like you're sitting
inside of a burrito.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.495
Three, it's funny but sneaky,

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.315
like you could be hearing
an interesting treatise

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:23.553
on income inequality,

00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:26.491
that's encased in a really
sophisticated poop joke.

00:03:26.515 --> 00:03:28.134
(Laughter)

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:31.181
Here's how I see
social justice comedy working.

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:34.503
A few years ago, I rounded up a bunch
of Muslim-American comedians --

00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:35.693
in a non-violent way --

00:03:35.717 --> 00:03:37.241
(Laughter)

00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:38.737
And we went around the country

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:41.698
to places like Alabama, Arizona,
Tennessee, Georgia --

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.921
places where they love the Muzzies --

00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:46.633
and we did stand-up shows.

00:03:46.657 --> 00:03:48.971
We called the tour
"The Muslims Are Coming!"

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.260
(Laughter)

00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:52.990
We turned this into a movie,

00:03:53.014 --> 00:03:55.238
and then after the movie came out,

00:03:55.262 --> 00:03:58.665
a known hate group spent 300,000 dollars

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.810
on an anti-Muslim poster campaign

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:03.705
with the MTA -- that's
the New York City subway system.

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.575
Now, the posters were truly offensive,

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.360
not to mentioned poorly designed --

00:04:07.384 --> 00:04:09.218
I mean, if you're going to be bigoted,

00:04:09.242 --> 00:04:10.994
you might as well use a better font.

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:12.019
(Laughter)

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:15.995
But we decided, why not launch
our own poster campaign

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.893
that says nice things about Muslims,

00:04:17.917 --> 00:04:19.164
while promoting the movie.

00:04:19.188 --> 00:04:21.313
So myself and fellow comedian
Dean Obeidallah

00:04:21.337 --> 00:04:24.833
decided to launch the fighting-bigotry-
with-delightful-posters campaign.

00:04:24.857 --> 00:04:28.607
We raised the money, worked
with the MTA for over 5 months,

00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:29.942
got the posters approved,

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:32.845
and two days after they
were supposed to go up,

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:36.016
the MTA decided to ban the posters,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.876
citing political content.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.133
Let's take a look
at a couple of those posters.

00:04:40.157 --> 00:04:41.451
Here's one.

00:04:41.475 --> 00:04:42.689
Facts about Muslims:

00:04:42.713 --> 00:04:44.810
Muslims invented
the concept of a hospital.

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:45.985
OK.

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.016
Fact: Grown-up Muslims can do
more push-ups than baby Muslims.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.579
(Laughter)

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:54.451
Fact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake.

00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:55.554
(Laughter)

00:04:55.578 --> 00:04:57.460
Let's take a look at another one.

00:04:57.484 --> 00:04:58.913
The ugly truth about Muslims:

00:04:58.937 --> 00:05:01.525
they have great frittata recipes.

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:06.056
Now clearly, frittatas are considered
political by the MTA.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.537
Either that, or the mere mention
of Muslims in a positive light

00:05:09.561 --> 00:05:11.585
was considered political -- but it isn't.

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:12.862
It's about justice.

00:05:12.886 --> 00:05:14.045
So we decided to change

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.677
our fighting-bigortry-
with-delightful-posters campaign

00:05:16.701 --> 00:05:20.180
and turn it into the fighting-bigotry-
with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign.

00:05:20.224 --> 00:05:21.839
(Laughter)

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:24.827
So basically, what I'm saying
is a couple of dirt-bag comedians

00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:27.382
took on a major New York City agency

00:05:27.406 --> 00:05:28.946
and the comedians won.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.546
(Applause and cheers)

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.721
Thank you.

00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:34.468
Victory was a very weird feeling.

00:05:34.492 --> 00:05:37.428
I was like, "Is this what
blonde girls feel like all the time?

00:05:37.452 --> 00:05:38.771
'Cause this is amazing!"

00:05:38.795 --> 00:05:40.795
(Laughter)

00:05:41.702 --> 00:05:43.193
Here's another example.

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.228
I'm asked everywhere I go:
"Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?"

00:05:47.252 --> 00:05:49.443
We do. But OK, I'll take the bait.

00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:52.113
So I decided to launch
thedailydenouncer.com.

00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:55.097
It's a website that denounces
terrorism every day of the week,

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:56.602
while taking the weekends off.

00:05:56.626 --> 00:05:58.984
Let's take a look at an example.

00:05:59.008 --> 00:06:01.405
They generally appear
as single-panel cartoons,

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:05.848
"I denounce terrorism! I also denounce
people who never fill the paper tray!"

00:06:05.872 --> 00:06:08.687
The point of the website
is that it denounces terrorism

00:06:08.711 --> 00:06:10.847
while recognizing that it's ridiculous

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:13.632
that we have to constantly
denounce terrorism.

00:06:13.656 --> 00:06:15.907
But if bigotry isn't your thing,

00:06:15.931 --> 00:06:19.322
social justice comedy is useful
for all sorts of issues.

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:22.237
For example, myself and fellow
comedian Lee Camp

00:06:22.261 --> 00:06:25.726
went to the Cayman Islands
to investigate offshore banking.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.655
Now, the United States loses
something like 300 billion dollars a year

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:32.504
in these offshore tax havens.

00:06:32.528 --> 00:06:33.782
Not to brag,

00:06:33.806 --> 00:06:35.274
but at the end of every month,

00:06:35.298 --> 00:06:37.942
I have something like 5-15 dollars
in disposable income.

00:06:37.966 --> 00:06:40.438
So we walked into these banks
in the Cayman Islands

00:06:40.462 --> 00:06:42.618
and asked if we could
open up a bank account

00:06:42.642 --> 00:06:44.688
with eight dollars and 27 cents.

00:06:44.712 --> 00:06:46.515
(Laughter)

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:51.970
The bank managers would indulge us
for 30-45 seconds before calling security.

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:54.566
Security would come out,
brandish their weapons,

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.360
and then we would squeal
with fear and run away,

00:06:57.384 --> 00:07:00.413
because -- and this is the last
rule of social justice comedy --

00:07:00.437 --> 00:07:03.151
sometimes it makes you want
to take a dump in your pants.

00:07:03.175 --> 00:07:06.022
Most of my work is meant to be fun.

00:07:06.046 --> 00:07:09.133
It's meant to generate
a connection and laughter.

00:07:09.157 --> 00:07:12.489
But yes, sometimes I get
run off the grounds by security.

00:07:12.513 --> 00:07:15.480
Sometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail.

00:07:15.504 --> 00:07:20.379
Sometimes I get voice mails saying
that if I continue telling my jokes,

00:07:20.403 --> 00:07:23.465
they'll kill me
and they'll kill my family.

00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:27.263
And those death threats
are definitely not funny.

00:07:27.287 --> 00:07:29.421
But despite the occasional danger,

00:07:29.445 --> 00:07:33.345
I still think that social justice comedy
is one of our best weapons.

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:36.424
I mean, we've tried
a lot of approaches to social justice,

00:07:36.448 --> 00:07:38.970
like war and competitive ice dancing.

00:07:38.994 --> 00:07:42.844
But still, a lot of things
are still kind of awful.

00:07:43.265 --> 00:07:46.507
So I think it's time we try and tell
a really good poop joke.

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.184
Thank you.

00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:52.500
(Applause)
