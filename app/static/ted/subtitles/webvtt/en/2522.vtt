00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.236
I've been living in rural East Africa
for about 10 years,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.440
and I want to share a field perspective
with you on global poverty.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:10.508
I believe that the greatest failure
of the human race

00:00:10.532 --> 00:00:13.938
is the fact that we've left more than
one billion of our members behind.

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:16.677
Hungry, extreme poverty:

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.989
these often seem like gigantic,
insurmountable problems,

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:21.446
too big to solve.

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:23.715
But as a field practitioner,

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.543
I believe these are actually
very solvable problems

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:29.008
if we just take the right strategies.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.505
Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker,

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.013
and he taught us that if we lean
on the right levers,

00:00:35.037 --> 00:00:36.447
we can move the world.

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:40.675
In the fight against extreme poverty,
I believe there are three powerful levers

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.072
that we can lean on.

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:45.098
This talk is all about those levers,
and why they make poverty

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.207
a winnable fight in our lifetimes.

00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:49.396
What is extreme poverty?

00:00:50.287 --> 00:00:52.232
When I first moved to rural East Africa,

00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:54.156
I stayed overnight with a farm family.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.729
They were wonderful people.

00:00:56.753 --> 00:00:59.625
They invited me into their home.
We sang songs together

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:00.800
and ate a simple dinner.

00:01:00.824 --> 00:01:02.928
They gave me a blanket
to sleep on the floor.

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.738
In the morning, however,
there was nothing to eat.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:09.702
And then at lunchtime, I watched
with an increasingly sick feeling

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:14.133
as the eldest girl in the family
cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.

00:01:14.703 --> 00:01:18.907
For that meal, every child
drank one cup to survive.

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:21.565
And I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt

00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:23.552
when they handed one of those cups to me,

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:26.048
and I knew I had to accept
their hospitality.

00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:30.761
Children need food not only to survive
but also to grow physically and mentally.

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:34.431
Every day they fail to eat,
they lose a little bit of their future.

00:01:35.114 --> 00:01:37.996
Amongst the extreme poor,
one in three children

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.620
are permanently stunted
from a lifetime of not eating enough.

00:01:42.326 --> 00:01:44.838
When that's combined
with poor access to health care,

00:01:44.862 --> 00:01:49.322
one in 10 extremely poor children
die before they reach age five.

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.356
And only one quarter of children
complete high school

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.884
because they lack school fees.

00:01:53.908 --> 00:01:59.680
Hunger and extreme poverty curb
human potential in every possible way.

00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:05.061
We see ourselves as a thinking,
feeling and moral human race,

00:02:05.085 --> 00:02:08.120
but until we solve these problems
for all of our members,

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:09.829
we fail that standard,

00:02:10.332 --> 00:02:12.674
because every person
on this planet matters.

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:14.490
This child matters.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:16.884
These children matter.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.442
This girl matters.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.898
You know, we see things like this,

00:02:21.922 --> 00:02:23.499
and we're upset by them,

00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:25.325
but they seem like such big problems.

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.184
We don't know how
to take effective action.

00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:30.790
But remember our friend Archimedes.

00:02:31.572 --> 00:02:33.900
Global poverty has powerful levers.

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:35.513
It's a problem like any other.

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:38.469
I live and work in the field,
and as a practitioner,

00:02:38.493 --> 00:02:41.296
I believe these are very
solvable problems.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.801
So for the next 10 minutes,

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:44.979
let's not be sad
about the state of the world.

00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:46.503
Let's engage our brains.

00:02:46.858 --> 00:02:49.603
Let's engage our collective passion
for problem-solving

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:51.816
and figure out what those levers are.

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:55.569
Lever number one: most
of the world's poor are farmers.

00:02:56.157 --> 00:02:58.220
Think about how extraordinary this is.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.705
If this picture represents
the world's poor,

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.034
then more than half engage in farming
as a major source of income.

00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:06.295
This gets me really excited.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.671
All of these people, one profession.

00:03:09.247 --> 00:03:10.703
Think how powerful this is.

00:03:10.727 --> 00:03:14.245
When farmers become more productive,
then more than half the world's poor

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.673
earn more money and climb out of poverty.

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:17.917
And it gets better.

00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:20.196
The product of farming
is, of course, food.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.825
So when farmers become more productive,
they earn more food,

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.570
and they don't just help themselves,

00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:28.820
but they help to feed healthy communities
and thriving economies.

00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:32.801
And when farmers become more productive,
they reduce environmental pressure.

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.725
We only have two ways
we can feed the world:

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.072
we can either make our existing farmland
a lot more productive,

00:03:39.096 --> 00:03:42.376
or we can clear cut forest and savannah
to make more farmland,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.650
which would be environmentally disastrous.

00:03:45.688 --> 00:03:49.000
Farmers are basically
a really important leverage point.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:51.429
When farmers become more productive,

00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:54.064
they earn more income,
they climb out of poverty,

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:58.163
they feed their communities and they
reduce environmental land pressure.

00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:00.832
Farmers stand at the center of the world.

00:04:02.306 --> 00:04:04.006
And not a farmer like this one,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.625
but rather this lady.

00:04:06.055 --> 00:04:08.211
Most of the farmers I know
are actually women.

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.971
Look at the strength and the will
radiating from this woman.

00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:14.207
She is physically strong, mentally tough,

00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:17.662
and she will do whatever it takes
to earn a better life for her children.

00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:20.830
If we're going to put the future
of humanity in one person's hands,

00:04:20.854 --> 00:04:22.667
then I'm really glad it's her.

00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:28.101
(Applause)

00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:29.381
There's just one problem:

00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:34.148
many smallholder farmers
lack access to basic tools and knowledge.

00:04:34.748 --> 00:04:38.436
Currently, they take a little bit
of saved food grain from the prior year,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.840
they plant it in the ground
and they till it with a manual hand hoe.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:44.629
These are tools and techniques
that date to the Bronze Age,

00:04:44.653 --> 00:04:47.591
and it's why many farmers
are still very poor.

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:50.137
But good news, again.

00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:51.312
Lever number two:

00:04:51.336 --> 00:04:55.702
humanity actually solved the problem
of agricultural poverty a century ago.

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.472
Let me walk you through the three
most basic factors in farming.

00:04:59.944 --> 00:05:04.341
First, hybrid seed is created
when you cross two seeds together.

00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:07.169
If you naturally pollinate
a high-yielding variety

00:05:07.193 --> 00:05:09.504
together with a drought-resistant variety,

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:13.366
you get a hybrid that inherits
positive traits from both of its parents.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.087
Next, conventional fertilizer,
if used responsibly,

00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:18.910
is environmentally sustainable.

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:22.427
If you micro-dose
just a pinch of fertilizer

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.535
to a plant that's taller than I am,

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:26.733
you unlock enormous yield gain.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.822
These are known as farm inputs.

00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:31.841
Farm inputs need to be combined
with good practice.

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:35.959
When you space your seeds
and plant with massive amounts of compost,

00:05:35.983 --> 00:05:38.536
farmers multiply their harvests.

00:05:38.946 --> 00:05:41.522
These proven tools and practices
have more than tripled

00:05:41.546 --> 00:05:44.594
agricultural productivity
in every major region of the world,

00:05:44.618 --> 00:05:47.391
moving mass numbers of people
out of poverty.

00:05:47.928 --> 00:05:51.267
We just haven't finished delivering
these things to everybody just yet,

00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:53.032
particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:55.647
So overall, this is amazing news.

00:05:55.671 --> 00:05:59.227
Humanity actually solved
agricultural poverty a century ago,

00:05:59.677 --> 00:06:00.884
in theory.

00:06:00.908 --> 00:06:03.832
We just haven't delivered these things
to everybody just yet.

00:06:04.354 --> 00:06:06.741
In this century, the reason
that people remain poor

00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:08.971
is because maybe they live
in remote places.

00:06:08.995 --> 00:06:11.090
They lack access to these things.

00:06:12.154 --> 00:06:14.715
Therefore, ending poverty
is simply a matter

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:18.161
of delivering proven goods
and services to people.

00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:20.483
We don't need more genius types right now.

00:06:20.507 --> 00:06:24.956
The humble delivery guy is going
to end global poverty in our lifetime.

00:06:26.088 --> 00:06:27.576
So these are the three levers,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.253
and the most powerful lever
is simply delivery.

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:34.320
Wherever the world's companies,
governments and nonprofits

00:06:34.344 --> 00:06:37.043
set up delivery networks
for life-improving goods,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.541
we eliminate poverty.

00:06:40.023 --> 00:06:42.016
OK, so that sounds really nice in theory,

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.330
but what about in practice?

00:06:43.354 --> 00:06:45.356
What do these delivery networks look like?

00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:48.541
I want to share the concrete example
that I know best,

00:06:48.565 --> 00:06:50.476
my organization, One Acre Fund.

00:06:51.165 --> 00:06:52.560
We only serve the farmer,

00:06:52.584 --> 00:06:55.949
and our job is to provide her
with the tools that she needs to succeed.

00:06:56.284 --> 00:06:59.238
We start off by delivering farm inputs
to really rural places.

00:06:59.262 --> 00:07:01.528
Now, this may appear
initially very challenging,

00:07:01.552 --> 00:07:03.763
but it's pretty possible. Let me show you.

00:07:03.787 --> 00:07:06.847
We buy farm inputs with the combined power
of our farmer network,

00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:09.190
and store it in 20 warehouses like this.

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:13.614
Then, during input delivery,
we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks

00:07:13.638 --> 00:07:16.476
and send them out to where farmers
are waiting in the field.

00:07:16.953 --> 00:07:20.391
They then get their individual orders
and walk it home to their farms.

00:07:20.415 --> 00:07:22.882
It's kind of like Amazon
for rural farmers.

00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:28.512
Importantly, realistic delivery
also includes finance, a way to pay.

00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:32.989
Farmers pay us little by little over time,
covering most of our expenses.

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:35.724
And then we surround
all that with training.

00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:39.802
Our rural field officers
deliver practical, hands-on training

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:41.231
to farmers in the field

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:42.800
every two weeks.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:47.080
Wherever we deliver our services,
farmers use these tools

00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:48.674
to climb out of poverty.

00:07:49.193 --> 00:07:51.617
This is a farmer
in our program, Consolata.

00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:53.876
Look at the pride on her face.

00:07:54.212 --> 00:07:57.870
She has achieved a modest prosperity
that I believe is the human right

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.507
of every hardworking person on the planet.

00:08:01.264 --> 00:08:06.166
Today, I'm proud to say that we're serving
about 400,000 farmers like Consolata.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:11.857
(Applause)

00:08:11.881 --> 00:08:14.159
The key to doing this
is scalable delivery.

00:08:14.482 --> 00:08:17.371
In any given area, we hire
a rural field officer

00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:20.551
who delivers our services
to 200 farmers, on average,

00:08:20.575 --> 00:08:23.426
with more than 1,000 people
living in those families.

00:08:23.805 --> 00:08:27.236
Today, we have 2,000
of these rural field officers

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.641
growing very quickly.

00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:30.472
This is our delivery army,

00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:32.658
and we're just one organization.

00:08:32.682 --> 00:08:35.846
There are many companies,
governments and nonprofits

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.081
that have delivery armies just like this.

00:08:38.105 --> 00:08:40.151
And I believe we stand at a moment in time

00:08:40.175 --> 00:08:45.078
where collectively, we are capable of
delivering farm services to all farmers.

00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:47.532
Let me show you how possible this is.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.829
This is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:08:49.853 --> 00:08:51.958
with a map of the United States for scale.

00:08:51.982 --> 00:08:55.370
I chose Sub-Saharan Africa because
this is a huge delivery territory.

00:08:55.394 --> 00:08:56.567
It's very challenging.

00:08:57.248 --> 00:09:00.901
But we analyzed every 50-mile
by 50-mile block on the continent,

00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:05.897
and we found that half of farmers
live in just these shaded regions.

00:09:07.265 --> 00:09:09.597
That's a remarkably small area overall.

00:09:10.195 --> 00:09:12.504
If you were to lay these boxes
next to each other

00:09:12.528 --> 00:09:14.164
within a map of the United States,

00:09:14.188 --> 00:09:16.453
they would only cover
the Eastern United States.

00:09:17.284 --> 00:09:20.526
You can order pizza
anywhere in this territory

00:09:20.832 --> 00:09:23.983
and it'll arrive to your house
hot, fresh and delicious.

00:09:24.581 --> 00:09:27.848
If America can deliver pizza
to an area of this size,

00:09:27.872 --> 00:09:30.895
then Africa's companies,
governments and non-profits

00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:33.942
can deliver farm services
to all of her farmers.

00:09:33.966 --> 00:09:35.249
This is possible.

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:39.748
I'm going to wrap up by generalizing
beyond just farming.

00:09:40.292 --> 00:09:42.399
In every field of human development,

00:09:42.423 --> 00:09:46.252
humanity has already invented
effective tools to end poverty.

00:09:46.276 --> 00:09:47.687
We just need to deliver them.

00:09:48.322 --> 00:09:50.563
So again, in every area
of human development,

00:09:50.587 --> 00:09:53.989
super-smart people a long time ago
invented inexpensive,

00:09:54.013 --> 00:09:55.845
highly effective tools.

00:09:55.869 --> 00:09:57.801
Humanity is armed to the teeth

00:09:57.825 --> 00:10:01.163
with simple, effective
solutions to poverty.

00:10:01.596 --> 00:10:04.368
We just need to deliver these
to a pretty small area.

00:10:05.266 --> 00:10:08.368
Again using the map
of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example,

00:10:08.392 --> 00:10:11.866
remember that rural poverty is
concentrated in these blue shaded areas.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.324
Urban poverty is even more concentrated,
in these green little dots.

00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:19.798
Again, using a map
of the United States for scale,

00:10:20.317 --> 00:10:23.876
this is what I would call
a highly achievable delivery zone.

00:10:24.346 --> 00:10:26.508
In fact, for the first time
in human history,

00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:30.031
we have a vast amount of delivery
infrastructure available to us.

00:10:30.055 --> 00:10:32.779
The world's companies,
governments and non-profits

00:10:32.803 --> 00:10:35.026
have delivery armies
that are fully capable

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.433
of covering this relatively small area.

00:10:37.927 --> 00:10:40.052
We just lack the will.

00:10:40.913 --> 00:10:42.324
If we are willing,

00:10:42.348 --> 00:10:44.156
every one of us has a role to play.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.291
We first need more people to pursue
careers in human development,

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.463
especially if you live
in a developing nation.

00:10:51.487 --> 00:10:54.973
We need more front line health workers,
teachers, farmer trainers,

00:10:54.997 --> 00:10:57.109
sales agents for life-improving goods.

00:10:57.439 --> 00:11:00.109
These are the delivery people
that dedicate their careers

00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:01.799
to improving the lives of others.

00:11:02.532 --> 00:11:04.485
But we also need a lot of support roles.

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:08.582
These are roles available
at just my organization alone,

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:10.096
and we're just one out of many.

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:14.173
This may surprise you, but no matter
what your technical specialty,

00:11:14.197 --> 00:11:16.407
there is a role for you in this fight.

00:11:17.158 --> 00:11:20.505
And no matter how logistically possible
it is to end poverty,

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:22.424
we need a lot more resources.

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:24.292
This is our number one constraint.

00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:28.187
For private investors, we need
a big expansion of venture capital,

00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:31.935
private equity, working capital,
available in emerging markets.

00:11:32.477 --> 00:11:35.586
But there are also limits
to what private business can accomplish.

00:11:35.928 --> 00:11:39.579
Private businesses often struggle
to profitably serve the extreme poor,

00:11:39.897 --> 00:11:42.229
so philanthropy still has
a major role to play.

00:11:42.998 --> 00:11:45.551
Anybody can give,
but we need more leadership.

00:11:46.112 --> 00:11:48.059
We need more visionary philanthropists

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:51.995
and global leaders who will take
problems in human development

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:55.049
and lead humanity to wipe them
off the face of the planet.

00:11:56.276 --> 00:11:59.098
If you're interested in these ideas,
check out this website.

00:11:59.122 --> 00:12:00.830
We need more leaders.

00:12:02.174 --> 00:12:04.196
Humanity has put people on the moon.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.797
We've invented supercomputers
that fit into our pockets

00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:08.877
and connect us with anybody on the planet.

00:12:08.901 --> 00:12:12.183
We've run marathons
at a five-minute mile pace.

00:12:12.207 --> 00:12:14.650
We are an exceptional people.

00:12:15.822 --> 00:12:18.948
But we've left more than one billion
of our members behind.

00:12:19.485 --> 00:12:21.783
Until every girl like this one
has an opportunity

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:23.705
to earn her full human potential,

00:12:24.047 --> 00:12:27.918
we have failed to become
a truly moral and just human race.

00:12:28.516 --> 00:12:31.272
Logistically speaking,
it's incredibly possible

00:12:31.296 --> 00:12:32.896
to end extreme poverty.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.102
We just need to deliver
proven goods and services

00:12:36.126 --> 00:12:37.323
to everybody.

00:12:37.665 --> 00:12:41.389
If we have the will, every one of us
has a role to play.

00:12:42.024 --> 00:12:44.913
Let's deploy our time, our careers,

00:12:44.937 --> 00:12:46.188
our collective wealth.

00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:49.517
Let us deliver an end to extreme poverty

00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:51.208
in this lifetime.

00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:53.122
Thank you.

00:12:53.146 --> 00:13:00.146
(Applause)
