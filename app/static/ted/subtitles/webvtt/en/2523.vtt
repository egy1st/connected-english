00:00:00.975 --> 00:00:06.435
Today 40 million Americans are indebted
for their passage to the new economy.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.143
Too poor to pay their way through college,

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:14.509
they now owe lenders
more than one trillion US dollars.

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.948
They do find what jobs they can get

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:20.457
to pay off a debt
that is secured on their person.

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:23.249
In America,

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:28.804
even a bankrupt gambler
gets a second chance.

00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:33.153
But it is nearly impossible

00:00:33.177 --> 00:00:36.652
for an American to get discharged
their student loan debts.

00:00:40.421 --> 00:00:43.141
Once upon a time in America,

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:45.815
going to college did not mean
graduating with debt.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:52.585
My friend Paul's father
graduated from Colorado State University

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:53.759
on the GI Bill.

00:00:55.546 --> 00:00:57.134
For his generation,

00:00:57.158 --> 00:01:00.006
higher education was free or almost free,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.427
because it was thought of
as a public good.

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:04.872
Not anymore.

00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:10.267
When Paul also graduated
from Colorado State University,

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:13.664
he paid for his English degree
by working part-time.

00:01:14.164 --> 00:01:15.315
30 years ago,

00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:18.006
higher education tuition
was affordable, reasonable,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.426
and what debts you accumulated,
you paid off by graduation date.

00:01:21.952 --> 00:01:23.102
Not anymore.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.203
Paul's daughter followed in his footsteps,

00:01:27.227 --> 00:01:28.528
but with one difference:

00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:31.044
when she graduated five years ago,

00:01:31.068 --> 00:01:32.417
it was with a whopping debt.

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.521
Students like Kate have to take on a loan

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:39.744
because the cost of higher education
has become unaffordable

00:01:39.768 --> 00:01:43.457
for many if not most American families.

00:01:44.427 --> 00:01:45.577
But so what?

00:01:46.117 --> 00:01:48.665
Getting into debt to buy
an expensive education

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.451
is not all bad if you could pay it off

00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:54.609
with the increased income
that you earned from it.

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:57.379
But that's where the rubber
meets the road.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:05.248
Even a college grad
earned 10 percent more in 2001

00:02:05.272 --> 00:02:07.247
than she did in 2013.

00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:09.134
So ...

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.438
tuition costs up,

00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:12.985
public funding down,

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.446
family incomes diminished,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.882
personal incomes weak.

00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:22.646
Is it any wonder that more
than a quarter of those who must

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.677
cannot make their student loan payments?

00:02:26.852 --> 00:02:29.829
The worst of times
can be the best of times,

00:02:29.853 --> 00:02:33.731
because certain truths flash up
in ways that you can't ignore.

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:36.392
I want to speak of three of them today.

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:41.445
1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.934
make it abundantly obvious

00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.696
that higher education
is a consumer product you can buy.

00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:53.101
All of us talk about education
just as the economists do now,

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:57.606
as an investment that you make
to improve the human stock

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.371
by training them for work.

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:04.535
As an investment you make
to sort and classify people

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.327
so that employers
can hire them more easily.

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.794
The U.S. News &amp; World Report
ranks colleges

00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:15.071
just as the consumer report
rates washing machines.

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:18.858
The language is peppered with barbarisms.

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:22.263
Teachers are called "service providers,"

00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:24.040
students are called "consumers."

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:29.390
Sociology and Shakespeare
and soccer and science,

00:03:29.414 --> 00:03:31.009
all of these are "content."

00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:34.699
Student debt is profitable.

00:03:34.723 --> 00:03:35.873
Only not on you.

00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:41.564
Your debt fattens the profit
of the student loan industry.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.477
The two 800-pound gorillas of which --

00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:46.564
Sallie Mae and Navient --

00:03:46.588 --> 00:03:51.794
posted last year a combined profit
of 1.2 billion dollars.

00:03:52.568 --> 00:03:55.140
And just like home mortgages,

00:03:55.164 --> 00:03:58.350
student loans can be bundled
and packaged and sliced and diced,

00:03:58.374 --> 00:03:59.624
and sold on Wall Street.

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:01.965
And colleges and universities

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.289
that invest in these securitized loans

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.321
profit twice.

00:04:07.735 --> 00:04:09.156
Once from your tuition,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.560
and then again from the interest on debt.

00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:15.474
With all that money to be made,

00:04:15.498 --> 00:04:21.085
are we surprised that some
in the higher education business

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.181
have begun to engage in false advertising,

00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:24.362
in bait and switch ...

00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:30.680
in exploiting the very ignorance
that they pretend to educate?

00:04:32.144 --> 00:04:33.294
Third:

00:04:33.678 --> 00:04:35.067
diplomas are a brand.

00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:38.092
Many years ago my teacher wrote,

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:40.657
"When students are treated as consumers,

00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:43.806
they're made prisoners
of addiction and envy."

00:04:47.794 --> 00:04:52.335
Just as consumers can be sold and resold
upgraded versions of an iPhone,

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:55.301
so also people can be sold
more and more education.

00:04:56.807 --> 00:04:58.673
College is the new high school,

00:04:58.697 --> 00:05:00.021
we already say that.

00:05:01.408 --> 00:05:02.807
But why stop there?

00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:06.308
People can be upsold
on certifications and recertifications,

00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:08.688
master's degrees, doctoral degrees.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:15.149
Higher education is also marketed
as a status object.

00:05:16.634 --> 00:05:17.785
Buy a degree,

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:20.996
much like you do a Lexus
of a Louis Vuitton bag,

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.814
to distinguish yourself from others.

00:05:22.838 --> 00:05:25.289
So you can be the object
of envy of others.

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.400
Diplomas are a brand.

00:05:29.034 --> 00:05:35.629
But these truths are often times
hidden by a very noisy sales pitch.

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:38.171
There is not a day that goes by

00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:43.232
without some policy guy
on television telling us,

00:05:43.256 --> 00:05:45.280
"A college degree is absolutely essential

00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:48.021
to get on that up escalator
to a middle-class life."

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.568
And the usual evidence offered
is the college premium:

00:05:52.592 --> 00:05:57.839
a college grad who makes on average
56 percent more than a high school grad.

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:00.473
Let's look at that number more carefully,

00:06:00.497 --> 00:06:01.823
because on the face of it,

00:06:01.847 --> 00:06:05.191
it seems to belie the stories we all hear

00:06:05.215 --> 00:06:09.603
about college grads
working as baristas and cashiers.

00:06:10.545 --> 00:06:15.696
Of 100 people who enroll
in any form of post-secondary education,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.768
45 do not complete it in a timely fashion,

00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:21.858
for a number of reasons,
including financial.

00:06:22.275 --> 00:06:24.188
Of the 55 that do graduate,

00:06:24.212 --> 00:06:26.260
two will remain unemployed,

00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:29.014
and another 18 are underemployed.

00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:33.733
So, college grads earn more
than high school grads,

00:06:33.757 --> 00:06:36.750
but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition

00:06:36.774 --> 00:06:39.165
and the lost wages while at college?

00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:42.257
Now even economists admit

00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:47.511
going to college pays off
for only those who complete it.

00:06:48.095 --> 00:06:52.127
But that's only because high school wages
have been cut to the bone,

00:06:52.151 --> 00:06:53.591
for decades now.

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:57.258
For decades,

00:06:57.282 --> 00:06:59.639
workers with a high school degree

00:06:59.663 --> 00:07:03.766
have been denied a fair share
of what they have produced.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.385
And had they received as they should have,

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:11.362
then going to college would have been
a bad investment for many.

00:07:11.386 --> 00:07:13.512
College premium?

00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:15.695
I think it's a high school discount.

00:07:16.688 --> 00:07:21.092
Two out of three people who enroll
are not going to find an adequate job.

00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:24.867
And the future, for them,
doesn't look particularly promising --

00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:26.613
in fact, it's downright bleak.

00:07:26.637 --> 00:07:29.041
And it is they who are going to suffer

00:07:30.541 --> 00:07:33.224
the most punishing forms of student debt.

00:07:34.002 --> 00:07:35.153
And it is they,

00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:36.558
curiously and sadly,

00:07:36.582 --> 00:07:40.391
who are marketed most loudly
about this college premium thing.

00:07:41.986 --> 00:07:44.383
That's not just cynical marketing,

00:07:44.407 --> 00:07:45.557
that's cruel.

00:07:47.277 --> 00:07:48.427
So what do we do?

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:54.888
What if students and parents treated
higher education as a consumer product?

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:57.738
Everybody else seems to.

00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:00.948
Then, like any other consumer product,

00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:03.471
you would demand to know
what you're paying for.

00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:04.710
When you buy medicines,

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.649
you get a list of side effects.

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:08.785
When you buy a higher educational product,

00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:10.443
you should have a warning label

00:08:10.467 --> 00:08:12.659
that allows consumers to choose,

00:08:12.683 --> 00:08:14.062
make informed choices.

00:08:14.838 --> 00:08:16.030
When you buy a car,

00:08:16.054 --> 00:08:18.665
it tells you how many
miles per gallon to expect.

00:08:19.188 --> 00:08:20.634
Who knows what to expect

00:08:20.658 --> 00:08:24.372
from a degree say, in Canadian Studies.

00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:26.465
There is such a thing, by the way.

00:08:28.989 --> 00:08:31.044
What if there was an app for that?

00:08:34.402 --> 00:08:39.270
One that linked up the cost of a major
to the expected income.

00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:42.574
Let's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT.

00:08:42.598 --> 00:08:44.120
One of you make this.

00:08:44.144 --> 00:08:45.683
(Laughter)

00:08:45.707 --> 00:08:47.439
Discover your reality.

00:08:47.463 --> 00:08:49.772
(Laughter)

00:08:49.796 --> 00:08:51.225
There are three advantages,

00:08:51.249 --> 00:08:53.930
three benefits to Income-Based Tuition.

00:08:55.232 --> 00:08:57.121
Any user can figure out

00:08:57.145 --> 00:09:00.349
how much money he or she will make
from a given college and major.

00:09:01.105 --> 00:09:02.447
Such informed users

00:09:02.471 --> 00:09:06.416
are unlikely to fall victim
to the huckster's ploy,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.850
to the sales pitch.

00:09:07.874 --> 00:09:09.580
But also to choose wisely.

00:09:09.604 --> 00:09:12.006
Why would anybody pay more for college

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.056
than let's say, 15 percent
of the additional income they earn?

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.756
There's a second benefit
to Income-Based Tuition.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.740
By tying the cost to the income,

00:09:22.764 --> 00:09:27.185
college administrators would be forced
to manage costs better,

00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:29.549
to find innovative ways to do so.

00:09:29.573 --> 00:09:30.727
For instance,

00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:34.811
all of you students here pay roughly
the same tuition for every major.

00:09:35.478 --> 00:09:39.525
That is manifestly unfair,
and should change.

00:09:40.295 --> 00:09:44.216
An engineering student uses more resources

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.649
and facilities and labs and faculty

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:48.351
than a philosophy student.

00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:51.685
But the philosophy student,
as a consequence,

00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:53.899
is subsidizing the engineering student.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.991
Who then, by the way,
goes on and earns more money.

00:09:57.015 --> 00:10:00.722
Why should two people
buy the same product,

00:10:00.746 --> 00:10:01.921
pay the same,

00:10:01.945 --> 00:10:04.722
but one person receive
half or a third of the service.

00:10:06.448 --> 00:10:10.519
In fact, college grads, some majors,

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:14.163
pay 25 percent of their income
servicing their student debt,

00:10:14.187 --> 00:10:15.860
while others pay five percent.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:22.026
That kind if inequity would end
when majors are priced more correctly.

00:10:23.042 --> 00:10:25.201
Now of course, all this data --

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:27.299
and one of you is going to do this, right?

00:10:27.323 --> 00:10:29.170
All this data has to be well designed,

00:10:29.194 --> 00:10:31.292
maybe audited by public accounting firms

00:10:31.316 --> 00:10:33.268
to avoid statistical lies.

00:10:33.292 --> 00:10:35.137
We know about statistics, right?

00:10:36.766 --> 00:10:37.989
But be that as it may,

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:42.394
the third and biggest benefit
of Income-Based Tuition,

00:10:42.418 --> 00:10:47.847
is it would free Americans from the fear
and the fact of financial ruin

00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:50.037
because they bought a defective product.

00:10:50.813 --> 00:10:53.132
Perhaps, in time,

00:10:53.156 --> 00:10:55.404
young and old Americans may rediscover,

00:10:55.428 --> 00:10:57.625
as the gentleman said earlier,

00:10:57.649 --> 00:10:59.688
their curiosity, their love of learning --

00:10:59.712 --> 00:11:01.149
begin to study what they love,

00:11:01.173 --> 00:11:02.352
love what they study,

00:11:02.376 --> 00:11:03.759
follow their passion ...

00:11:04.577 --> 00:11:07.046
getting stimulated by their intelligence,

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.507
follow paths of inquiry
that they really want to.

00:11:10.848 --> 00:11:15.298
After all, it was Eric and Kevin,

00:11:15.322 --> 00:11:16.490
two years ago,

00:11:17.498 --> 00:11:20.930
just exactly these kinds of young men,

00:11:20.954 --> 00:11:22.976
who prompted me and worked with me,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.561
and still do,

00:11:24.585 --> 00:11:28.271
in the study of indebted
students in America.

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:30.803
Thank you for your attention.

00:11:30.827 --> 00:11:35.391
(Applause)
