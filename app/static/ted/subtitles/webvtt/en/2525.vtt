00:00:01.863 --> 00:00:05.553
What does it mean to spend our time well?

00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:09.982
I spend a lot of my time

00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:13.616
thinking about how to spend my time.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.201
Probably too much --
I probably obsess over it.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.670
My friends think I do.

00:00:18.694 --> 00:00:23.181
But I feel like I kind of have to,
because these days,

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:27.086
it feels like little bits of my time
kind of slip away from me,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.628
and when that happens, it feels like
parts of my life are slipping away.

00:00:33.086 --> 00:00:34.237
Specifically,

00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:37.110
it feels like little bits
of my time get slipped away

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:38.738
to various things like this,

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:40.729
like technology -- I check things.

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:42.804
I'll give you an example.

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:45.577
If this email shows up --

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.286
how many of you have gotten
an email like this, right?

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.608
I've been tagged in a photo.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.487
When this appears,

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:56.922
I can't help but click on it right now.

00:00:56.946 --> 00:00:59.487
Right? Because, like,
what if it's a bad photo?

00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:01.216
So I have to click it right now.

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:04.029
But I'm not just going
to click "See photo,"

00:01:04.053 --> 00:01:06.951
what I'm actually going to do
is spend the next 20 minutes.

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:08.152
(Laughter)

00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:12.213
But the worst part is that I know
this is what's going to happen,

00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:15.682
and even knowing
that's what's going to happen

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:18.522
doesn't stop me
from doing it again the next time.

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.633
Or I find myself in a situation like this,

00:01:24.097 --> 00:01:27.671
where I check my email
and I pull down to refresh,

00:01:29.164 --> 00:01:32.515
But the thing is that 60 seconds later,

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.670
I'll pull down to refresh again.

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:39.947
Why am I doing this?

00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:41.779
This doesn't make any sense.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.508
But I'll give you a hint
why this is happening.

00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:52.865
What do you think makes
more money in the United States

00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:59.221
than movies, game parks
and baseball combined?

00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:02.983
Slot machines.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:07.892
How can slot machines make all this money

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.583
when we play with such small
amounts of money?

00:02:14.022 --> 00:02:15.680
We play with coins.

00:02:15.704 --> 00:02:16.979
How is this possible?

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:20.082
Well, the thing is ...

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.575
my phone is a slot machine.

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.797
Every time I check my phone,

00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:30.138
I'm playing the slot machine to see,

00:02:30.162 --> 00:02:31.354
what am I going to get?

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:33.085
What am I going to get?

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.950
Every time I check my email,

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:36.426
I'm playing the slot machine,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.061
saying, "What am I going to get?"

00:02:38.085 --> 00:02:40.806
Every time I scroll a news feed,

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:43.276
I'm playing the slot machine to see,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.882
what am I going to get next?

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:47.497
And the thing is that,

00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:50.613
again, knowing exactly
how this works -- and I'm a designer,

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.914
I know exactly how
the psychology of this works,

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:54.793
I know exactly what's going on --

00:02:54.817 --> 00:02:57.059
but it doesn't leave me with any choice,

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:59.134
I still just get sucked into it.

00:03:00.173 --> 00:03:01.983
So what are we going to do?

00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:06.012
Because it leaves us
with this all-or-nothing relationship

00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:07.516
with technology, right?

00:03:08.478 --> 00:03:10.016
You're either on,

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.885
and you're connected
and distracted all the time,

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.759
or you're off,

00:03:14.783 --> 00:03:16.037
but then you're wondering,

00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.686
am I missing something important?

00:03:18.352 --> 00:03:20.606
In other words, you're either distracted

00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:23.504
or you have fear of missing out.

00:03:24.363 --> 00:03:25.520
Right?

00:03:26.822 --> 00:03:30.924
So we need to restore choice.

00:03:31.942 --> 00:03:34.462
We want to have
a relationship with technology

00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:38.692
that gives us back choice
about how we spend time with it,

00:03:38.716 --> 00:03:41.773
and we're going to need
help from designers,

00:03:42.662 --> 00:03:45.467
because knowing this stuff doesn't help.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.543
We're going to need design help.

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:49.494
So what would that look like?

00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:53.463
So let's take an example that we all face:

00:03:53.487 --> 00:03:55.533
chat -- text messaging.

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:57.666
So let's say there's two people.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.846
Nancy's on the left
and she's working on a document,

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.077
and John's on the right.

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.306
And John suddenly remembers,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.933
"I need to ask Nancy
for that document before I forget."

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.958
So when he sends her that message,

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:14.068
it blows away her attention.

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:18.844
That's what we're doing all the time,
bulldozing each other's attention,

00:04:18.868 --> 00:04:20.282
left and right.

00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:22.072
And there's serious cost to this,

00:04:22.534 --> 00:04:25.165
because every time
we interrupt each other,

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.976
it takes us about 23 minutes, on average,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.840
to refocus our attention.

00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:35.212
We actually cycle through
two different projects

00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:37.945
before we come back
to the original thing we were doing.

00:04:38.806 --> 00:04:43.147
This is Gloria Mark's research
combined with Microsoft research,

00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:44.529
that showed this.

00:04:44.553 --> 00:04:48.508
And her research also shows
that it actually trains bad habits.

00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:50.977
The more interruptions we get externally,

00:04:51.482 --> 00:04:55.762
it's conditioning and training us
to interrupt ourselves.

00:04:56.303 --> 00:04:59.883
We actually self-interrupt
every three-and-a-half minutes.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:02.327
This is crazy.

00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:03.652
So how do we fix this?

00:05:03.676 --> 00:05:06.926
Because Nancy and John are in this
all-or-nothing relationship.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.451
Nancy might want to disconnect,

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:09.828
but then she'd be worried:

00:05:09.852 --> 00:05:11.903
What if I'm missing something important?

00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:14.259
Design can fix this problem.

00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:17.344
Let's say you have
Nancy again on the left,

00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:18.540
John on the right.

00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:21.255
And John remembers,
"I need to send Nancy that document."

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.508
Except this time,

00:05:22.532 --> 00:05:24.469
Nancy can mark that she's focused.

00:05:24.493 --> 00:05:26.461
Let's say she drags a slider and says,

00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:28.408
"I want to be focused for 30 minutes,"

00:05:28.432 --> 00:05:29.867
so -- bam -- she's focused.

00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:33.391
Now when John wants to message her,

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:35.542
he can get the thought off of his mind --

00:05:35.566 --> 00:05:37.639
because he has a need,
he has this thought,

00:05:37.663 --> 00:05:40.090
and he needs to dump it out
before he forgets.

00:05:40.744 --> 00:05:42.266
Except this time,

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.594
it holds the messages
so that Nancy can still focus,

00:05:46.618 --> 00:05:49.161
but John can get the thought
off of his mind.

00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:54.074
But this only works
if one last thing is true,

00:05:54.098 --> 00:05:58.584
which is that Nancy needs to know
that if something is truly important,

00:05:59.564 --> 00:06:01.242
John can still interrupt.

00:06:04.158 --> 00:06:08.271
But instead of having constant
accidental or mindless interruptions,

00:06:08.295 --> 00:06:10.977
we're now only creating
conscious interruptions,

00:06:12.985 --> 00:06:14.506
So we're doing two things here.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.632
We're creating a new choice
for both Nancy and John,

00:06:18.436 --> 00:06:21.242
But there's a second, subtle thing
we're doing here, too.

00:06:22.022 --> 00:06:25.151
And it's that we're changing
the question we're answering.

00:06:25.922 --> 00:06:28.910
Instead of the goal of chat being:

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.253
"Let's design it so it's easy
to send a message" --

00:06:33.277 --> 00:06:34.707
that's the goal of chat,

00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:37.426
it should be really easy to send
a message to someone --

00:06:37.808 --> 00:06:40.888
we change the goal to something
deeper and a human value,

00:06:40.912 --> 00:06:45.116
which is: "Let's create the highest
possible quality communication

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.623
in a relationship between two people.

00:06:48.162 --> 00:06:50.027
So we upgraded the goal.

00:06:51.832 --> 00:06:54.643
Now, do designers
actually care about this?

00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:59.696
Do we want to have conversations
about what these deeper human goals are?

00:07:00.538 --> 00:07:02.297
Well, I'll tell you one story.

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:05.391
A little over a year ago,

00:07:05.415 --> 00:07:08.495
I got to help organize a meeting

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:13.391
between some of technology's leading
designers and Thich Nhat Hanh.

00:07:14.297 --> 00:07:19.134
Thich Nhat Hanh is an international
spokesperson for mindfulness meditation.

00:07:19.158 --> 00:07:20.909
And it was the most amazing meeting.

00:07:20.933 --> 00:07:22.953
You have to imagine -- picture a room --

00:07:22.977 --> 00:07:26.830
on one side of the room,
you have a bunch of tech geeks;

00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:28.350
on the other side of the room,

00:07:28.374 --> 00:07:33.355
you have a bunch of long brown robes,
shaved heads, Buddhist monks.

00:07:34.442 --> 00:07:37.673
And the questions were about
the deepest human values,

00:07:37.697 --> 00:07:40.015
like what does the future
of technology look like

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:42.254
when you're designing
for the deepest questions

00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:43.761
and the deepest human values?

00:07:44.445 --> 00:07:48.135
And our conversation centered
on listening more deeply

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:50.087
to what those values might be.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:52.636
He joked in our conversation

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.608
that what if, instead of a spell check,

00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:57.582
you had a compassion check,

00:07:57.606 --> 00:08:01.969
meaning, you might highlight a word
that might be accidentally abrasive --

00:08:01.993 --> 00:08:03.907
perceived as abrasive by someone else.

00:08:04.844 --> 00:08:08.815
So does this kind of conversation
happen in the real world,

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:10.961
not just in these design meetings?

00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:13.092
Well, the answer is yes,

00:08:13.116 --> 00:08:15.413
and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.866
If you didn't know,
Couchsurfing is a website

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.775
that matches people
who are looking for a place to stay

00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:25.670
with a free couch, from someone
who's trying to offer it.

00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:27.728
So, great service --

00:08:27.752 --> 00:08:29.416
what would their design goal be?

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.187
What are you designing
for if you work at Couchsurfing?

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:36.735
Well, you would think
it's to match guests with hosts.

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:38.739
Right?

00:08:38.763 --> 00:08:40.018
That's a pretty good goal.

00:08:40.042 --> 00:08:42.961
But that would kind of be like
our goal with messaging before,

00:08:42.985 --> 00:08:45.350
where we're just trying
to deliver a message.

00:08:45.374 --> 00:08:47.516
So what's the deeper, human goal?

00:08:48.175 --> 00:08:50.120
Well, they set their goal

00:08:50.144 --> 00:08:55.798
as the need to create lasting,
positive experiences and relationships

00:08:55.822 --> 00:08:57.981
between people who've never met before.

00:08:59.343 --> 00:09:01.926
And the most amazing thing
about this was in 2007,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.591
they introduced a way to measure this,

00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:06.066
which is incredible.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.397
I'll tell you how it works.

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:08.968
For every design goal you have,

00:09:08.992 --> 00:09:11.060
you have to have
a corresponding measurement

00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:12.633
to know how you're doing --

00:09:12.657 --> 00:09:13.992
a way of measuring success.

00:09:14.016 --> 00:09:15.312
So what they do is,

00:09:15.336 --> 00:09:17.779
let's say you take two people who meet up,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.765
and they take the number of days
those two people spent together,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.480
and then they estimate how many
hours were in those days --

00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:31.953
how many hours did
those two people spend together?

00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:34.112
And then after they spend
that time together,

00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:35.326
they ask both of them:

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.308
How positive was your experience?

00:09:37.332 --> 00:09:40.381
Did you have a good experience
with this person that you met?

00:09:40.952 --> 00:09:44.322
And they subtract
from those positive hours

00:09:44.346 --> 00:09:47.663
the amount of time
people spent on the website,

00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:51.139
because that's a cost to people's lives.

00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:53.426
Why should we value that as success?

00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:55.522
And what you were left with

00:09:55.546 --> 00:10:00.287
is something they refer to as "net
orchestrated conviviality,"

00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:02.993
or, really, just a net
"Good Times" created.

00:10:03.017 --> 00:10:08.049
The net hours that would have never
existed, had Couchsurfing not existed.

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:12.759
Can you imagine how inspiring it would be
to come to work every day

00:10:12.783 --> 00:10:14.276
and measure your success

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:19.329
in the actual net new contribution
of hours in people's lives

00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:21.954
that are positive,
that would have never existed

00:10:21.978 --> 00:10:24.788
if you didn't do what you were
about to do at work today?

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:30.672
Can you imagine a whole world
that worked this way?

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:34.319
Can you imagine a social network that --

00:10:34.343 --> 00:10:35.926
let's say you care about cooking,

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.981
and it measured its success
in terms of cooking nights organized

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:41.970
and the cooking articles
that you were glad you read,

00:10:41.994 --> 00:10:44.971
and subtracted from that the articles
you weren't glad you read

00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:47.558
or the time you spent scrolling
that you didn't like?

00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:51.505
Imagine a professional social network

00:10:51.529 --> 00:10:55.444
that, instead of measuring its success
in terms of connections created

00:10:55.468 --> 00:10:57.057
or messages sent,

00:10:57.081 --> 00:11:01.393
instead measured its success in terms
of the job offers that people got

00:11:01.417 --> 00:11:03.246
that they were excited to get.

00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:07.919
And subtracted the amount of time
people spent on the website.

00:11:08.643 --> 00:11:11.678
Or imagine dating services,

00:11:11.702 --> 00:11:13.440
like maybe Tinder or something,

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.942
where instead of measuring the number
of swipes left and right people did,

00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:19.050
which is how they measure success today,

00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:25.219
instead measured the deep, romantic,
fulfilling connections people created.

00:11:26.613 --> 00:11:28.672
Whatever that was for them, by the way.

00:11:31.886 --> 00:11:35.114
But can you imagine a whole world
that worked this way,

00:11:35.138 --> 00:11:37.390
that was helping you spend your time well?

00:11:39.009 --> 00:11:41.038
Now to do this you also need a new system,

00:11:41.062 --> 00:11:42.740
because you're probably thinking,

00:11:42.764 --> 00:11:44.319
today's Internet economy --

00:11:44.343 --> 00:11:45.776
today's economy in general --

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.070
is measured in time spent.

00:11:47.094 --> 00:11:49.141
The more users you have,

00:11:49.165 --> 00:11:50.543
the more usage you have,

00:11:50.567 --> 00:11:51.885
the more time people spend,

00:11:51.909 --> 00:11:53.567
that's how we measure success.

00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:56.351
But we've solved this problem before.

00:11:57.335 --> 00:11:59.901
We solved it with organic,

00:11:59.925 --> 00:12:02.859
when we said we need
to value things a different way.

00:12:02.883 --> 00:12:05.819
We said this is a different kind of food.

00:12:07.067 --> 00:12:09.116
So we can't compare it
just based on price;

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.980
this is a different category of food.

00:12:11.004 --> 00:12:13.737
We solved it with Leed Certification,

00:12:13.761 --> 00:12:17.208
where we said this
is a different kind of building

00:12:17.232 --> 00:12:21.379
that stood for different values
of environmental sustainability.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.548
What if we had something
like that for technology?

00:12:27.772 --> 00:12:32.969
What if we had something
whose entire purpose and goal

00:12:32.993 --> 00:12:37.266
was to help create net new positive
contributions to human life?

00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:42.326
And what if we could
value it a different way,

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.848
so it would actually work?

00:12:44.634 --> 00:12:48.565
Imagine you gave this different
premium shelf space on app stores.

00:12:48.589 --> 00:12:50.924
Imagine you had web browsers
that helped route you

00:12:50.948 --> 00:12:53.422
to these kinds of design products.

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:59.973
Can you imagine how exciting it would be
to live and create that world?

00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:03.932
We can create this world today.

00:13:04.978 --> 00:13:07.750
Company leaders, all you have to do --

00:13:07.774 --> 00:13:10.662
only you can prioritize a new metric,

00:13:11.146 --> 00:13:15.549
which is your metric for net positive
contribution to human life.

00:13:15.573 --> 00:13:17.624
And have an honest
conversation about that.

00:13:17.648 --> 00:13:19.809
Maybe you're not
doing so well to start with,

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.524
but let's start that conversation.

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:28.730
Designers, you can redefine success;
you can redefine design.

00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:32.687
Arguably, you have more power
than many people in your organization

00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:35.634
to create the choices
that all of us live by.

00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:37.712
Maybe like in medicine,

00:13:37.736 --> 00:13:39.594
where we have a Hippocratic oath

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:43.740
to recognize the responsibility
and this higher value

00:13:43.764 --> 00:13:45.331
that we have to treat patients.

00:13:45.355 --> 00:13:47.395
What if designers had something like that,

00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:49.251
in terms of this new kind of design?

00:13:50.668 --> 00:13:52.673
And users, for all of us --

00:13:52.697 --> 00:13:56.200
we can demand technology
that works this way.

00:13:57.176 --> 00:13:58.843
Now it may seem hard,

00:13:58.867 --> 00:14:03.264
but McDonald's didn't have salads
until the consumer demand was there.

00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:08.722
Walmart didn't have organic food
until the consumer demand was there.

00:14:08.746 --> 00:14:13.491
We have to demand
this new kind of technology.

00:14:14.194 --> 00:14:15.475
And we can do that.

00:14:16.092 --> 00:14:17.604
And doing that

00:14:17.628 --> 00:14:21.145
would amount to shifting
from a world that's driven and run

00:14:21.169 --> 00:14:23.739
entirely on time spent,

00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:29.186
to world that's driven by time well spent.

00:14:31.569 --> 00:14:33.656
I want to live in this world,

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.768
and I want this conversation to happen.

00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:38.436
Let's start that conversation now.

00:14:39.707 --> 00:14:40.858
Thank you.

00:14:40.882 --> 00:14:42.777
(Applause)
