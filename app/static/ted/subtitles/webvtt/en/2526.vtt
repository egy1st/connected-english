WEBVTT

00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.109
So we all have our own biases.

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.784
For example, some of us tend to think

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:09.417
that it's very difficult to transform
failing government systems.

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:11.618
When we think of government systems,

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:15.233
we tend to think that they're archaic,
set in their ways,

00:00:15.257 --> 00:00:17.953
and perhaps, the leadership
is just too bureaucratic

00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:19.382
to be able to change things.

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:23.112
Well, today, I want
to challenge that theory.

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:27.955
I want to tell you a story
of a very large government system

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:31.423
that has not only put itself
on the path of reform

00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:34.636
but has also shown
fairly spectacular results

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.995
in less than three years.

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:41.026
This is what a classroom
in a public school in India looks like.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.402
There are 1 million such schools in India.

00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:47.010
And even for me,
who's lived in India all her life,

00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:50.081
walking into one of these schools
is fairly heartbreaking.

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:53.175
By the time kids are 11,

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.231
50 percent of them have fallen
so far behind in their education

00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:58.995
that they have no hope to recover.

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:02.404
11-year-olds cannot do simple addition,

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:05.310
they cannot construct
a grammatically correct sentence.

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:09.042
These are things that you and I
would expect an 8-year-old

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.334
to be able to do.

00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:13.469
By the time kids are 13 or 14,

00:01:13.493 --> 00:01:15.273
they tend to drop out of schools.

00:01:16.313 --> 00:01:19.587
In India, public schools
not only offer free education --

00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:23.024
they offer free textbooks,
free workbooks, free meals,

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:25.118
sometimes even cash scholarships.

00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:28.676
And yet, 40 percent of the parents today

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.880
are choosing to pull their children
out of public schools

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:35.421
and pay out of their pockets
to put them in private schools.

00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:39.110
As a comparison,
in a far richer country, the US,

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:41.055
that number is only 10 percent.

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:46.330
That's a huge statement on how broken
the Indian public education system is.

00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:51.907
So it was with that background
that I got a call in the summer of 2013

00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:55.754
from an absolutely brilliant lady
called Surina Rajan.

00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:59.895
She was, at that time, the head
of the Department of School Education

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.185
in a state called Haryana in India.

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.280
So she said to us, "Look, I've been
heading this department

00:02:05.304 --> 00:02:06.530
for the last two years.

00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:09.985
I've tried a number of things,
and nothing seems to work.

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:11.470
Can you possibly help?"

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:15.666
Let me describe Haryana
a little bit to you.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.049
Haryana is a state
which has 30 million people.

00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:22.892
It has 15,000 public schools

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:25.751
and 2 million plus
children in those public schools.

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.563
So basically, with that phone call,

00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:31.009
I promised to help a state and system

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:35.356
which was as large as that of Peru
or Canada transform itself.

00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:40.168
As I started this project,
I was very painfully aware of two things.

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:43.403
One, that I had never done
anything like this before.

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:47.802
And two, many others had,
perhaps without too much success.

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:51.009
As my colleagues and I
looked across the country

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:52.341
and across the world,

00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:54.233
we couldn't find another example

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:57.083
that we could just pick up
and replicate in Haryana.

00:02:57.107 --> 00:02:59.607
We knew that we had to craft
our own journey.

00:03:00.692 --> 00:03:03.746
But anyway, we jumped right in
and as we jumped in,

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.509
all sorts of ideas started flying at us.

00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:09.571
People said, "Let's change
the way we recruit teachers,

00:03:09.595 --> 00:03:12.339
let's hire new principals and train them

00:03:12.363 --> 00:03:14.581
and send them on international
learning tours,

00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:17.104
let's put technology inside classrooms."

00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:19.734
By the end of week one,
we had 50 ideas on the table,

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:21.986
all amazing, all sounded right.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.713
There was no way we were
going to be able to implement 50 things.

00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:28.853
So I said, "Hang on, stop.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:32.424
Let's first at least decide
what is it we're trying to achieve."

00:03:32.448 --> 00:03:35.222
So with a lot of push and pull and debate,

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:39.133
Haryana set itself a goal
which said: by 2020,

00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:43.144
we want 80 percent of our children
to be at grade-level knowledge.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.473
Now the specifics of the goal
don't matter here,

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:49.411
but what matters
is how specific the goal is.

00:03:49.786 --> 00:03:52.758
Because it really allowed us
to take all those ideas

00:03:52.782 --> 00:03:54.207
which were being thrown at us

00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:56.605
and say which ones
we were going to implement.

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.948
Does this idea support this goal?
If yes, let's keep it.

00:04:00.972 --> 00:04:04.252
But if it doesn't or we're not sure,
then let's put it aside.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:08.900
As simple as it sounds,
having a very specific goal right up front

00:04:08.924 --> 00:04:12.140
has really allowed us to be
very sharp and focused

00:04:12.164 --> 00:04:13.792
in our transformation journey.

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:16.434
And looking back over
the last two and a half years,

00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:18.420
that has been a huge positive for us.

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:20.652
So we had the goal,

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:24.082
and now we needed to figure out
what are the issues, what is broken.

00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.728
Before we went into schools,
a lot of people told us

00:04:27.752 --> 00:04:29.818
that education quality is poor

00:04:29.842 --> 00:04:33.716
because either the teachers are lazy,
they don't come into schools,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.974
or they're incapable,
they actually don't know how to teach.

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:41.710
Well, when we went inside schools,
we found something completely different.

00:04:41.734 --> 00:04:45.317
On most days, most teachers
were actually inside schools.

00:04:45.771 --> 00:04:47.350
And when you spoke with them,

00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:51.185
you realized they were perfectly capable
of teaching elementary classes.

00:04:51.952 --> 00:04:53.756
But they were not teaching.

00:04:54.702 --> 00:04:56.101
I went to a school

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:59.209
where the teachers were getting
the construction of a classroom

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.311
and a toilet supervised.

00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:03.287
I went to another school

00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:06.202
where two of the teachers
had gone to a nearby bank branch

00:05:06.226 --> 00:05:08.968
to deposit scholarship money
into kids' accounts.

00:05:09.452 --> 00:05:13.743
At lunchtime, most teachers
were spending all of their time

00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:17.868
getting the midday meal cooking,
supervised and served to the students.

00:05:18.907 --> 00:05:20.111
So we asked the teachers,

00:05:20.135 --> 00:05:22.883
"What's going on,
why are you not teaching?"

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:25.383
And they said, "This is
what's expected of us.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.811
When a supervisor comes to visit us,

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:31.224
these are exactly the things
that he checks.

00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:33.928
Has the toilet been made,
has the meal been served.

00:05:33.952 --> 00:05:37.062
When my principal
goes to a meeting at headquarters,

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:39.473
these are exactly the things
which are discussed."

00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:44.505
You see, what had happened was,
over the last two decades,

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.359
India had been fighting the challenge
of access, having enough schools,

00:05:48.383 --> 00:05:51.154
and enrollment, bringing children
into the schools.

00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:54.608
So the government
launched a whole host of programs

00:05:54.632 --> 00:05:56.491
to address these challenges,

00:05:56.515 --> 00:06:01.272
and the teachers became
the implicit executors of these programs.

00:06:01.296 --> 00:06:03.444
Not explicitly, but implicitly.

00:06:04.652 --> 00:06:09.668
And now, what was actually needed
was not to actually train teachers further

00:06:09.692 --> 00:06:11.591
or to monitor their attendance

00:06:11.615 --> 00:06:15.486
but to tell them
that what is most important

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.110
is for them to go back
inside classrooms and teach.

00:06:18.134 --> 00:06:21.988
They needed to be monitored
and measured and awarded

00:06:22.012 --> 00:06:23.360
on the quality of teaching

00:06:23.384 --> 00:06:25.227
and not on all sorts of other things.

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:28.478
So as we went through
the education system,

00:06:28.502 --> 00:06:33.762
as we delved into it deeper,
we found a few such core root causes

00:06:33.786 --> 00:06:37.918
which were determining, which were
shaping how people behaved in the system.

00:06:37.942 --> 00:06:41.625
And we realized that unless we change
those specific things,

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:43.602
we could do a number of other things.

00:06:43.626 --> 00:06:46.469
We could train, we could put
technology into schools,

00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:48.473
but the system wouldn't change.

00:06:48.497 --> 00:06:51.554
And addressing these non-obvious
core issues

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.387
became a key part of the program.

00:06:54.678 --> 00:06:57.630
So, we had the goal and we had the issues,

00:06:57.654 --> 00:07:00.403
and now we needed to figure out
what the solutions were.

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:03.326
We obviously did not want
to recreate the wheel,

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.100
so we said, "Let's look around
and see what we can find."

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.387
And we found these beautiful,
small pilot experiments

00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:13.582
all over the country
and all over the world.

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:18.114
Small things being done by NGOs,
being done by foundations.

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:22.095
But what was also interesting
was that none of them actually scaled.

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:25.657
All of them were limited
to 50, 100 or 500 schools.

00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:28.721
And here, we were looking
for a solution for 15,000 schools.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.884
So we looked into why,

00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:34.023
if these things actually work,
why don't they actually scale?

00:07:34.572 --> 00:07:37.807
What happens is that
when a typical NGO comes in,

00:07:37.831 --> 00:07:40.244
they not only bring in their expertise

00:07:40.268 --> 00:07:42.783
but they also bring in
additional resources.

00:07:42.807 --> 00:07:44.564
So they might bring in money,

00:07:44.588 --> 00:07:45.909
they might bring in people,

00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:47.627
they might bring in technology.

00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:52.040
And in the 50 or 100 schools
that they actually operate in,

00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:54.924
those additional resources
actually create a difference.

00:07:55.476 --> 00:07:58.008
But now imagine that the head of this NGO

00:07:58.032 --> 00:08:00.787
goes to the head
of the School Education Department

00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:04.076
and says, "Hey, now let's do this
for 15,000 schools."

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.553
Where is that guy or girl
going to find the money

00:08:07.577 --> 00:08:10.281
to actually scale this up
to 15,000 schools?

00:08:10.305 --> 00:08:12.067
He doesn't have the additional money,

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.688
he doesn't have the resources.

00:08:13.712 --> 00:08:16.063
And hence, innovations don't scale.

00:08:16.938 --> 00:08:20.341
So right at the beginning
of the project, what we said was,

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:23.011
"Whatever we have to do
has to be scalable,

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:26.322
it has to work in all 15,000 schools."

00:08:26.346 --> 00:08:30.138
And hence, it has to work
within the existing budgets

00:08:30.162 --> 00:08:32.693
and resources that the state actually has.

00:08:33.552 --> 00:08:35.427
Much easier said than done.

00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:36.840
(Laughter)

00:08:36.864 --> 00:08:39.020
I think this was definitely
the point in time

00:08:39.044 --> 00:08:40.888
when my team hated me.

00:08:40.912 --> 00:08:46.090
We spent a lot of long hours
in office, in cafés,

00:08:46.114 --> 00:08:47.409
sometimes even in bars,

00:08:47.433 --> 00:08:49.096
scratching out heads and saying,

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.386
"Where are the solutions,
how are we going to solve this problem?"

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:56.190
In the end, I think we did
find solutions to many of the issues.

00:08:56.214 --> 00:08:58.087
I'll give you an example.

00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:00.053
In the context of effective learning,

00:09:00.077 --> 00:09:03.362
one of the things people talk about
is hands-on learning.

00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:05.654
Children shouldn't memorize
things from books,

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:07.267
they should do activities,

00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:09.290
and that's a more effective way to learn.

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:11.612
Which basically means
giving students things

00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:15.058
like beads, learning rods, abacuses.

00:09:15.082 --> 00:09:17.536
But we did not have
the budgets to give that

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.175
to 15,000 schools, 2 million children.

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:21.902
We needed another solution.

00:09:22.446 --> 00:09:23.992
We couldn't think of anything.

00:09:24.368 --> 00:09:27.197
One day, one of our team members
went to a school

00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:31.587
and saw a teacher pick up sticks
and stones from the garden outside

00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:33.432
and take them into the classroom

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:34.968
and give them to the students.

00:09:35.726 --> 00:09:38.633
That was a huge eureka moment for us.

00:09:39.617 --> 00:09:42.500
So what happens now
in the textbooks in Haryana

00:09:42.524 --> 00:09:45.266
is that after every concept,
we have a little box

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.678
which are instructions
for the teachers which say,

00:09:47.702 --> 00:09:51.858
"To teach this concept,
here's an activity that you can do.

00:09:51.882 --> 00:09:54.969
And by the way, in order
to actually do this activity,

00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:58.172
here are things that you can use
from your immediate environment,

00:09:58.196 --> 00:10:01.217
whether it be the garden outside
or the classroom inside,

00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:03.686
which can be used
as learning aids for kids."

00:10:04.194 --> 00:10:06.640
And we see teachers all over Haryana

00:10:06.664 --> 00:10:09.914
using lots of innovative things
to be able to teach students.

00:10:10.617 --> 00:10:14.202
So in this way, whatever we designed,

00:10:14.226 --> 00:10:16.304
we were actually able to implement it

00:10:16.328 --> 00:10:19.132
across all 15,000 schools from day one.

00:10:20.304 --> 00:10:22.490
Now, this brings me to my last point.

00:10:22.514 --> 00:10:25.787
How do you implement something
across 15,000 schools

00:10:25.811 --> 00:10:27.568
and 100,000 teachers?

00:10:28.357 --> 00:10:30.379
The department used to have a process

00:10:30.403 --> 00:10:31.677
which is very interesting.

00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:34.402
I like to call it "The Chain of Hope."

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.600
They would write a letter
from the headquarters

00:10:38.624 --> 00:10:40.249
and send it to the next level,

00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:41.756
which was the district offices.

00:10:42.186 --> 00:10:44.843
They would hope that in each
of these district offices,

00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:48.842
an officer would get the letter,
would open it, read it

00:10:48.866 --> 00:10:50.960
and then forward it to the next level,

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.991
which was the block offices.

00:10:53.015 --> 00:10:56.780
And then you would hope
that at the block office,

00:10:56.804 --> 00:10:58.287
somebody else got the letter,

00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:02.330
opened it, read it and forwarded it
eventually to the 15,000 principals.

00:11:02.354 --> 00:11:05.013
And then one would hope
that the principals

00:11:05.037 --> 00:11:07.684
got the letter, received it,
understood it

00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:09.638
and started implementing it.

00:11:09.662 --> 00:11:11.309
It was a little bit ridiculous.

00:11:12.684 --> 00:11:15.145
Now, we knew technology was the answer,

00:11:15.169 --> 00:11:17.310
but we also knew
that most of these schools

00:11:17.334 --> 00:11:19.411
don't have a computer or email.

00:11:20.497 --> 00:11:23.580
However, what the teachers do have
are smartphones.

00:11:23.604 --> 00:11:28.283
They're constantly on SMS,
on Facebook and on WhatsApp.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.895
So what now happens in Haryana is,

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:35.539
all principals and teachers are divided
into hundreds of WhatsApp groups

00:11:35.563 --> 00:11:38.385
and anytime something needs
to be communicated,

00:11:38.409 --> 00:11:40.830
it's just posted across
all WhatsApp groups.

00:11:41.486 --> 00:11:43.687
It spreads like wildfire.

00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:46.704
You can immediately check
who has received it,

00:11:46.728 --> 00:11:48.018
who has read it.

00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:51.902
Teachers can ask clarification
questions instantaneously.

00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:53.167
And what's interesting is,

00:11:53.191 --> 00:11:56.549
it's not just the headquarters
who are answering these questions.

00:11:56.573 --> 00:11:59.462
Another teacher from
a completely different part of the state

00:11:59.486 --> 00:12:01.879
will stand up and answer the question.

00:12:01.903 --> 00:12:04.583
Everybody's acting
as everybody's peer group,

00:12:04.607 --> 00:12:06.401
and things are getting implemented.

00:12:07.784 --> 00:12:10.067
So today, when you go
to a school in Haryana,

00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:11.678
things look different.

00:12:11.702 --> 00:12:14.132
The teachers are back inside classrooms,

00:12:14.156 --> 00:12:15.460
they're teaching.

00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:17.342
Often with innovative techniques.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.842
When a supervisor
comes to visit the classroom,

00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:24.733
he or she not only checks
the construction of the toilet

00:12:24.757 --> 00:12:27.100
but also what is the quality of teaching.

00:12:28.092 --> 00:12:31.208
Once a quarter,
all students across the state

00:12:31.232 --> 00:12:33.397
are assessed on their learning outcomes

00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:36.279
and schools which are
doing well are rewarded.

00:12:36.303 --> 00:12:38.772
And schools which are not doing so well

00:12:38.796 --> 00:12:41.201
find themselves having
difficult conversations.

00:12:41.568 --> 00:12:43.647
Of course, they also get
additional support

00:12:43.671 --> 00:12:45.607
to be able to do better in the future.

00:12:47.232 --> 00:12:48.856
In the context of education,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.247
it's very difficult
to see results quickly.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.605
When people talk about systemic,
large-scale change,

00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:58.208
they talk about periods
of 7 years and 10 years.

00:12:58.232 --> 00:12:59.497
But not in Haryana.

00:13:00.153 --> 00:13:04.105
In the last one year, there have been
three independent studies,

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:06.708
all measuring student learning outcomes,

00:13:06.732 --> 00:13:09.039
which indicate that something fundamental,

00:13:09.063 --> 00:13:11.153
something unique is happening in Haryana.

00:13:11.622 --> 00:13:14.630
Learning levels of children
have stopped declining,

00:13:14.654 --> 00:13:16.457
and they have started going up.

00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:19.691
Haryana is one of the few
states in the country

00:13:19.715 --> 00:13:21.294
which is showing an improvement,

00:13:21.318 --> 00:13:25.021
and certainly the one that is showing
the fastest rate of improvement.

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:27.373
These are still early signs,

00:13:27.397 --> 00:13:28.591
there's a long way to go,

00:13:28.615 --> 00:13:31.106
but this gives us a lot of hope
for the future.

00:13:32.859 --> 00:13:34.422
I recently went to a school,

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:36.389
and as I was leaving,

00:13:36.413 --> 00:13:37.564
I ran into a lady,

00:13:37.588 --> 00:13:38.739
her name was Parvati,

00:13:38.763 --> 00:13:40.201
she was the mother of a child,

00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:41.496
and she was smiling.

00:13:41.828 --> 00:13:44.737
And I said, "Why are you smiling,
what's going on?"

00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:47.507
And she said, "I don't know
what's going on,

00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:50.618
but what I do know
is that my children are learning,

00:13:50.642 --> 00:13:52.093
they're having fun,

00:13:52.117 --> 00:13:55.312
and for the time being, I'll stop
my search for a private school

00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:56.499
to send them to."

00:13:57.523 --> 00:13:59.523
So I go back to where I started:

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:01.421
Can government systems transform?

00:14:02.163 --> 00:14:03.663
I certainly believe so.

00:14:03.687 --> 00:14:05.781
I think if you give them the right levers,

00:14:05.805 --> 00:14:07.288
they can move mountains.

00:14:07.735 --> 00:14:08.886
Thank you.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:15.025
(Applause)
