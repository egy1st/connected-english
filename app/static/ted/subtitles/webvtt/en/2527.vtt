00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:03.293
When I was a kid,

00:00:03.317 --> 00:00:05.825
I experienced something so powerful,

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.923
I spent the rest of my life
searching for it,

00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:10.459
and in all the wrong places.

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:13.920
What I experienced wasn't virtual reality.

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:15.816
It was music.

00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:18.547
And this is where the story begins.

00:00:19.797 --> 00:00:21.167
That's me,

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:23.137
listening to the Beatles' "White Album."

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:26.329
And the look on my face is the feeling

00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:29.099
that I've been searching for ever since.

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:32.524
Music goes straight to the emotional vein,

00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:34.154
into your bloodstream

00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:35.509
and right into your heart.

00:00:36.157 --> 00:00:38.678
It deepens every experience.

00:00:39.717 --> 00:00:40.883
Fellas?

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:45.672
(Music)

00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:49.624
This is the amazing McKenzie Stubbert

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.527
and Joshua Roman.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.714
Music --

00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:53.932
(Applause)

00:00:53.956 --> 00:00:55.114
Yeah.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.455
Music makes everything
have more emotional resonance.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.158
Let's see how it does for this talk.

00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:07.569
The right piece of music
at the right time fuses with us

00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:08.918
on a cellular level.

00:01:09.382 --> 00:01:11.662
When I hear that one song

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:13.805
from that one summer

00:01:14.488 --> 00:01:15.665
with that one girl,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.501
I'm instantly transported
back there again.

00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:21.130
Hey, Stacey.

00:01:22.908 --> 00:01:26.186
Here's a part of the story, though,
where I got a little greedy.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.808
I thought if I added more layers
on top of the music,

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:33.646
I could make the feelings
even more powerful.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.504
So I got into directing music videos.

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:38.906
This is what they looked like.

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:43.672
That's my brother, Jeff.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.121
Sorry about this, Jeff.

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:47.232
(Laughter)

00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:49.203
Here's me, just so we're even.

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:51.885
Incredible moves.

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:53.785
Should've been a dancer.

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:54.931
(Laughter)

00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:56.267
These experiments grew,

00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:59.075
and in time, started
to look more like this.

00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:04.492
In both, I'm searching
for the same thing, though,

00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:07.175
to capture that lightning in a bottle.

00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:09.865
Except, I'm not.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.448
Adding moving pictures over the music
added narrative dimension, yes,

00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:16.785
but never quite equated the power

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.553
that just raw music had for me on its own.

00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:23.949
This is not a great thing to realize
when you've devoted your life

00:02:23.973 --> 00:02:26.812
and professional career
to becoming a music video director.

00:02:26.836 --> 00:02:29.137
I kept asking myself,
did I take the wrong path?

00:02:30.353 --> 00:02:34.204
So I started thinking: if I could
involve you, the audience, more,

00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:37.230
I might be able to make you
feel something more as well.

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:41.086
So Aaron Koblin and I began
auditioning new technologies

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.248
that could put more of you
inside of the work,

00:02:44.272 --> 00:02:47.906
like your childhood home
in "The Wilderness Downtown,"

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.510
your hand-drawn portraits,
in "The Johnny Cash Project,"

00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:54.981
and your interactive dreams

00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:57.488
in "3 Dreams of Black."

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.426
We were pushing beyond the screen,

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.431
trying to connect more deeply

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:05.832
to people's hearts and imaginations.

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:08.091
But it wasn't quite enough.

00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:14.057
It still didn't have the raw
experiential power of pure music for me.

00:03:15.443 --> 00:03:17.504
So I started chasing a new technology

00:03:17.528 --> 00:03:20.227
that I only had read about
in science fiction.

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:23.235
And after years of searching,
I found a prototype.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:28.095
It was a project from Nonny de la Peña
in Mark Bolas's lab in USC.

00:03:29.102 --> 00:03:32.170
And when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.

00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:34.587
I could taste the lightning.

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:36.984
It was called virtual reality.

00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:40.303
This was it five years ago
when I ran into it.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.592
This is what it looks like now.

00:03:44.846 --> 00:03:48.751
I quickly started building things
in this new medium,

00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:50.992
and through that process
we realized something:

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:55.081
that VR is going to play
an incredibly important role

00:03:55.105 --> 00:03:56.820
in the history of mediums.

00:03:57.681 --> 00:04:00.398
In fact, it's going to be the last one.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.005
I mean this because it's the first medium
that actually makes the jump

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:08.317
from our internalization
of an author's expression

00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:10.011
of an experience,

00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:12.687
to our experiencing it firsthand.

00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.855
You look confused.
I'll explain. Don't worry.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.273
(Laughter)

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.020
If we go back to the origins of mediums,

00:04:21.044 --> 00:04:22.408
by all best guesses,

00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:25.398
it starts around a fire,
with a good story.

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:27.451
Our clan leader is telling us

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:31.104
about how he hunted the woolly mammoth
on the tundra that day.

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:33.408
We hear his words

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.363
and translate them
into our own internal truths.

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:40.004
The same thing happens

00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:42.670
when we look at the cave painting
version of the story,

00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:45.824
the book about the mammoth hunt,

00:04:46.472 --> 00:04:47.706
the play,

00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:49.295
the radio broadcast,

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:50.914
the television show

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:52.737
or the movie.

00:04:53.532 --> 00:04:57.264
All of these mediums require
what we call "suspension of disbelief,"

00:04:57.288 --> 00:05:01.346
because there's a translation gap
between the reality of the story

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.792
and our consciousness
interpreting the story

00:05:04.816 --> 00:05:06.084
into our reality.

00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:11.157
I'm using the word "consciousness"
as a feeling of reality that we get

00:05:11.181 --> 00:05:14.517
from our senses experiencing
the world around us.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.377
Virtual reality bridges that gap.

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:24.198
Now, you are on the tundra
hunting with the clan leader.

00:05:24.222 --> 00:05:26.576
Or you are the clan leader.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.302
Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth.

00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:30.961
(Laughter)

00:05:34.218 --> 00:05:35.830
So here's what special about VR.

00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:38.305
In all other mediums,

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:40.599
your consciousness interprets the medium.

00:05:41.044 --> 00:05:45.214
In VR, your consciousness is the medium.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.833
So the potential for VR is enormous.

00:05:48.857 --> 00:05:50.531
But where are we now?

00:05:50.555 --> 00:05:53.141
What is the current state of the art?

00:05:54.318 --> 00:05:55.468
Well,

00:05:56.746 --> 00:05:57.935
we are here.

00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:01.872
We are the equivalent
of year one of cinema.

00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:03.522
This is the Lumière Brothers film

00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:06.905
that allegedly sent a theater full
of people running for their lives

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:09.222
as they thought a train
was coming toward them.

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:13.412
Similar to this early stage
of this medium,

00:06:13.436 --> 00:06:16.977
in VR, we also have to move
past the spectacle

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.887
and into the storytelling.

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.658
It took this medium decades

00:06:20.682 --> 00:06:23.340
to figure out its preferred
language of storytelling,

00:06:23.364 --> 00:06:25.140
in the form of a feature film.

00:06:25.164 --> 00:06:28.518
In VR today, we're more learning grammar

00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:29.833
than writing language.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.431
We've made 15 films in the last year
at our VR company, Vrse,

00:06:34.455 --> 00:06:36.072
and we've learned a few things.

00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:40.116
We found that we have a unique,
direct path into your senses,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.949
your emotions, even your body.

00:06:43.897 --> 00:06:45.572
So let me show you some things.

00:06:45.596 --> 00:06:46.994
For the purpose of this demo,

00:06:47.018 --> 00:06:50.083
we're going to take every direction
that you could possibly look,

00:06:50.107 --> 00:06:52.320
and stretch it into this giant rectangle.

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:55.033
OK, here we go.

00:06:57.642 --> 00:07:01.923
So, first: camera movement
is tricky in VR.

00:07:01.947 --> 00:07:04.049
Done wrong, it can actually make you sick.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.429
We found if you move the camera
at a constant speed in a straight line,

00:07:09.453 --> 00:07:11.670
you can actually get away with it, though.

00:07:11.694 --> 00:07:13.421
The first day in film school,

00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:16.032
they told me you have to learn
every single rule

00:07:16.056 --> 00:07:17.814
before you can break one.

00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:20.012
We have not learned every single rule.

00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:21.564
We've barely learned any at all,

00:07:21.588 --> 00:07:23.405
but we're already trying to break them

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:25.958
to see what kind of creative things
we can accomplish.

00:07:25.982 --> 00:07:29.694
In this shot here, where we're moving up
off the ground, I added acceleration.

00:07:29.718 --> 00:07:32.551
I did that because I wanted
to give you a physical sensation

00:07:32.575 --> 00:07:33.958
of moving up off the ground.

00:07:33.982 --> 00:07:36.475
In VR, I can give that to you.

00:07:37.797 --> 00:07:41.871
(Music)

00:07:43.882 --> 00:07:47.429
Not surprisingly, music matters a lot
in this medium as well.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.716
It guides us how to feel.

00:07:50.354 --> 00:07:53.675
In this project we made
with the New York Times, Zach Richter

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.454
and our friend, JR,

00:07:55.478 --> 00:07:57.363
we take you up in a helicopter,

00:07:57.387 --> 00:08:01.325
and even though you're flying
2,000 feet above Manhattan,

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.937
you don't feel afraid.

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:05.869
You feel triumphant for JR's character.

00:08:07.022 --> 00:08:08.501
The music guides you there.

00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:10.525
(Music)

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:18.971
Contrary to popular belief,

00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:21.661
there is composition in virtual reality,

00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:23.746
but it's completely
different than in film,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.495
where you have a rectangular frame.

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:28.031
Composition is now
where your consciousness exists

00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:30.002
and how the world moves around you.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:34.291
In this film, "Waves of Grace,"
which was a collaboration between Vrse,

00:08:34.315 --> 00:08:37.224
the United Nations, Gabo Arora,
and Imraan Ismail,

00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:40.490
we also see the changing role
of the close-up in virtual reality.

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:45.352
A close-up in VR means
you're actually close up to someone.

00:08:45.954 --> 00:08:48.597
It brings that character inside
of your personal space,

00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:52.466
a space that we'd usually reserve
for the people that we love.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.660
And you feel an emotional
closeness to the character

00:08:55.684 --> 00:08:58.392
because of what you feel
to be a physical closeness.

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:08.978
Directing VR is not like
directing for the rectangle.

00:09:09.002 --> 00:09:12.086
It's more of a choreography
of the viewer's attention.

00:09:12.864 --> 00:09:15.458
One tool we can use
to guide your attention

00:09:15.482 --> 00:09:16.915
is called "spatialized sound."

00:09:16.939 --> 00:09:19.907
I can put a sound anywhere
in front of you, to left or right,

00:09:19.931 --> 00:09:21.310
even behind you,

00:09:21.334 --> 00:09:24.330
and when you turn your head,
the sound will rotate accordingly.

00:09:24.354 --> 00:09:27.856
So I can use that to direct your attention
to where I want you to see.

00:09:28.308 --> 00:09:30.886
Next time you hear someone
singing over your shoulder,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.171
it might be Bono.

00:09:32.195 --> 00:09:33.402
(Laughter)

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:41.294
VR makes us feel
like we are part of something.

00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:45.968
For most of human history,
we lived in small family units.

00:09:45.992 --> 00:09:47.503
We started in caves,

00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:50.960
then moved to clans and tribes,
then villages and towns,

00:09:50.984 --> 00:09:53.676
and now we're all global citizens.

00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:58.011
But I believe that we are still
hardwired to care the most

00:09:58.035 --> 00:10:00.532
about the things that are local to us.

00:10:01.325 --> 00:10:06.283
And VR makes anywhere
and anyone feel local.

00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:08.815
That's why it works as an empathy machine.

00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:12.063
Our film "Clouds Over Sidra"
takes you to a Syrian refugee camp,

00:10:12.087 --> 00:10:16.638
and instead of watching a story
about people over there,

00:10:16.662 --> 00:10:20.485
it's now a story about us here.

00:10:22.386 --> 00:10:23.896
But where do we go from here?

00:10:24.432 --> 00:10:26.889
The tricky thing is that
with all previous mediums,

00:10:26.913 --> 00:10:29.283
the format is fixed at its birth.

00:10:30.182 --> 00:10:32.071
Film has been a sequence of rectangles,

00:10:32.095 --> 00:10:34.934
from Muybridge and his horses to now.

00:10:35.377 --> 00:10:36.927
The format has never changed.

00:10:37.654 --> 00:10:41.101
But VR as a format, as a medium,

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.619
isn't complete yet.

00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:47.966
It's not using physical celluloid
or paper or TV signals.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.809
It actually employs what we use
to make sense of the world.

00:10:52.642 --> 00:10:56.545
We're using your senses
as the paints on the canvas,

00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:57.891
but only two right now.

00:10:59.653 --> 00:11:03.493
Eventually, we can see if we will have
all of our human senses employed,

00:11:03.517 --> 00:11:07.712
and we will have agency to live
the story in any path we choose.

00:11:08.575 --> 00:11:11.031
And we call it virtual reality right now,

00:11:11.055 --> 00:11:13.849
but what happens when we move
past simulated realities?

00:11:15.345 --> 00:11:16.775
What do we call it then?

00:11:17.503 --> 00:11:20.339
What if instead of verbally
telling you about a dream,

00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:23.137
I could let you live inside that dream?

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.487
What if instead of just experiencing
visiting some reality on Earth,

00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:31.937
you could surf gravitational waves
on the edge of a black hole,

00:11:31.961 --> 00:11:34.737
or create galaxies from scratch,

00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:37.845
or communicate with each other
not using words

00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:39.772
but using our raw thoughts?

00:11:41.254 --> 00:11:43.335
That's not a virtual reality anymore.

00:11:44.052 --> 00:11:46.398
And honestly I don't know
what that's called.

00:11:46.884 --> 00:11:49.216
But I hope you see where we're going.

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:54.351
But here I am, intellectualizing
a medium I'm saying is experiential.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.265
So let's experience it.

00:11:56.845 --> 00:12:00.040
In your hands, you hopefully hold
a piece of cardboard.

00:12:01.143 --> 00:12:02.776
Let's open the flap.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.333
Tap on the power button
to unlock the phone.

00:12:06.145 --> 00:12:07.769
For the people watching at home,

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:09.629
we're going to put up a card right now

00:12:09.653 --> 00:12:12.883
to show you how to download
this experience on your phone yourself,

00:12:12.907 --> 00:12:16.208
and even get a Google cardboard
of your own to try it with.

00:12:17.275 --> 00:12:19.802
We played in cardboard boxes as kids,

00:12:19.826 --> 00:12:24.410
and as adults, I'm hoping we can all find
a little bit of that lightning

00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:27.208
by sticking our head in one again.

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:31.044
You're about to participate

00:12:31.068 --> 00:12:35.520
in the largest collective
VR viewing in history.

00:12:36.236 --> 00:12:39.854
And in that classic old-timey
style of yesteryear,

00:12:39.878 --> 00:12:42.109
we're all going to watch something

00:12:42.133 --> 00:12:44.130
at the exact same time, together.

00:12:45.019 --> 00:12:46.442
Let's hope it works.

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:48.651
What's the countdown
look like? I can't see.

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:59.558
Audience: ...15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9,

00:12:59.582 --> 00:13:06.446
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

00:13:10.327 --> 00:13:14.155
(Birds singing)

00:13:22.508 --> 00:13:25.168
(Train engine)

00:13:33.351 --> 00:13:35.351
Audience: (Shreiks)

00:13:51.285 --> 00:13:52.575
(Video) JR: Let me tell you

00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:55.076
how I shot the cover
of the New York Times Magazine,

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.194
"Walking New York."

00:14:06.577 --> 00:14:09.987
I just got strapped on
outside the helicopter,

00:14:10.011 --> 00:14:14.255
and I had to be perfectly
vertical so I could grab it.

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:15.897
And when I was perfectly above --

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:18.658
you know, with the wind,
we had to redo it a few times --

00:14:18.682 --> 00:14:20.476
then I kept shooting.

00:14:27.598 --> 00:14:29.296
(Video) Woman's voice: Dear Lord,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.220
protect us from evil,

00:14:32.654 --> 00:14:33.865
for you are the Lord,

00:14:35.044 --> 00:14:36.231
the light.

00:14:41.824 --> 00:14:44.207
You who gave us life took it away.

00:14:46.191 --> 00:14:47.771
Let your will be done.

00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:53.505
Please bring peace to the many
who have lost loved ones.

00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:55.272
Help us to live again.

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:01.683
(Music)

00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:18.527
(Video) (Children's voices)

00:15:19.504 --> 00:15:24.169
Child's voice: There are more kids
in Zaatari than adults right now.

00:15:29.924 --> 00:15:31.953
Sometimes I think

00:15:31.977 --> 00:15:34.411
we are the ones in charge.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.785
Chris Milk: How was it?

00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:44.524
(Applause)

00:15:44.548 --> 00:15:47.477
That was a cheap way of getting you
to do a standing ovation.

00:15:47.501 --> 00:15:50.309
I just made you all stand.
I knew you'd applaud at the end.

00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:51.974
(Applause)

00:15:51.998 --> 00:15:55.817
I believe that everyone on Earth
needs to experience

00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:57.421
what you just experienced.

00:15:58.036 --> 00:16:01.203
That way we can collectively
start to shape this,

00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:03.001
not as a tech platform

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:04.600
but as a humanity platform.

00:16:05.498 --> 00:16:08.682
And to that end, in November of last year,

00:16:08.706 --> 00:16:11.992
the New York Times and Vrse made
a VR project called "The Displaced."

00:16:12.016 --> 00:16:14.362
It launched with one million
Google Cardboards

00:16:14.386 --> 00:16:17.859
sent out to every Sunday subscriber
with their newspaper.

00:16:17.883 --> 00:16:20.401
But a funny thing happened
that Sunday morning.

00:16:20.425 --> 00:16:21.747
A lot of people got them

00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:25.977
that were not the intended recipients
on the mailing label.

00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:29.545
And we started seeing this
all over Instagram.

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:34.239
Look familiar?

00:16:36.252 --> 00:16:38.395
Music led me on a path

00:16:38.419 --> 00:16:41.468
of searching for what seemed
like the unattainable

00:16:41.492 --> 00:16:42.745
for a very long time.

00:16:43.466 --> 00:16:47.437
Now, millions of kids just had
the same formative experience

00:16:47.461 --> 00:16:49.202
in their childhood

00:16:49.226 --> 00:16:51.530
that I had in mine.

00:16:52.316 --> 00:16:54.545
Only I think this one

00:16:54.569 --> 00:16:55.727
surpasses it.

00:16:56.358 --> 00:16:57.508
Let's see

00:16:57.859 --> 00:16:59.009
where this

00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:00.723
leads them.

00:17:01.384 --> 00:17:02.535
Thank you.

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:09.041
(Applause)
