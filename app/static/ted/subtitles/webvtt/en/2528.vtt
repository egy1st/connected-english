00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.071
As a little Hawaiian,

00:00:02.095 --> 00:00:05.477
my mom and auntie always told me
stories about Kalaupapa --

00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:06.822
the Hawaiian leper colony

00:00:06.846 --> 00:00:09.673
surrounded by the highest
sea cliffs in the world --

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:11.109
and Father Damien,

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.561
the Belgian missionary who gave his life
for the Hawaiian community.

00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:16.465
As a young nurse,

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:19.430
my aunt trained the nuns
caring for the remaining lepers

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:22.731
almost a 100 years after
Father Damien died of leprosy.

00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:26.172
I remember stories she told

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:29.148
about traveling down
switchback cliff paths on a mule,

00:00:29.172 --> 00:00:32.303
while my uncle played
her favorite hula songs on the ukulele

00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:34.004
all the way down to Kalaupapa.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.231
You see, as a youngster,

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:38.191
I was always curious about a few things.

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:43.731
First was why a Belgian missionary
chose to live in complete isolation

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:44.945
in Kalaupapa,

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.199
knowing he would inevitably
contract leprosy

00:00:47.223 --> 00:00:49.603
from the community of people
he sought to help.

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:52.593
And secondly,

00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:54.978
where did the leprosy bacteria come from?

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.757
And why were Kānaka Maoli,

00:00:56.781 --> 00:00:59.030
the indigenous people of Hawaii,

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:03.416
so susceptible to developing
leprosy, or "mai Pake?"

00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:07.583
This got my curious about what
makes us unique as Hawaiians --

00:01:07.607 --> 00:01:09.448
namely, our genetic makeup.

00:01:10.964 --> 00:01:12.908
But it wasn't until high school,

00:01:12.932 --> 00:01:14.544
through the Human Genome Project,

00:01:14.568 --> 00:01:16.767
that I realized I wasn't alone

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:19.619
in trying to connect
our unique genetic ancestry

00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:23.325
to our potential health,
wellness and illness.

00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:25.211
You see,

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:27.034
the 2.7 billion-dollar project

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:31.048
promised an era of predictive
and preventative medicine

00:01:31.072 --> 00:01:33.485
based on our unique genetic makeup.

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:35.525
So to me it always seemed obvious

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.277
that in order to achieve this dream,

00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:42.314
we would need to sequence
a diverse cohort of people

00:01:42.338 --> 00:01:45.742
to obtain the full spectrum
of human genetic variation on the planet.

00:01:46.303 --> 00:01:48.875
That's why 10 years later,

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.573
it continues to shock me,

00:01:50.597 --> 00:01:53.811
knowing that 96 percent of genome studies

00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:57.415
associating common genetic variation
with specific diseases

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.240
have focused exclusively
on individuals of European ancestry.

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.478
Now you don't need a PhD

00:02:03.502 --> 00:02:06.535
to see that that leaves four percent
for the rest of diversity.

00:02:07.164 --> 00:02:09.292
And in my own searching,

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:11.825
I've discovered that far less
than one percent

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.923
have actually focused on indigenous
communities, like myself.

00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:17.528
So that begs the question:

00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:20.099
Who is the Human Genome
Project actually for?

00:02:20.853 --> 00:02:23.211
Just like we have
different colored eyes and hair,

00:02:23.235 --> 00:02:24.743
we metabolize drugs differently

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:26.634
based on the variation in our genomes.

00:02:26.978 --> 00:02:30.415
So how many of you
would be shocked to learn

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.221
that 95 percent of clinical trials

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:37.661
have also exclusively featured
individuals of European ancestry?

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:39.722
This bias

00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:43.587
and systematic lack of engagement
of indigenous people

00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:46.595
in both clinical trials
and genome studies

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.559
is partially the result
of a history of distrust.

00:02:50.893 --> 00:02:52.043
For example,

00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:55.996
in 1989, researchers
from Arizona State University

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.586
obtained blood samples
from Arizona's Havasupai tribe,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.544
promising to alleviate the burden
of type 2 diabetes

00:03:02.568 --> 00:03:04.428
that was plaguing their community,

00:03:04.452 --> 00:03:08.337
only to turn around and use
those exact same samples --

00:03:08.361 --> 00:03:10.064
without the Havasupai's consent --

00:03:10.088 --> 00:03:13.593
to study rates
of schizophrenia, inbreeding,

00:03:13.617 --> 00:03:16.592
and challenge
the Havasupai's origin story.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.861
When the Havasupai found out,

00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:23.078
they sued successfully for $700,000,

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:28.445
and they banned ASU from conducting
research on their reservation.

00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.215
This culminated in a sort of domino effect

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.001
with local tribes in the Southwest --

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:35.454
including the Navajo Nation,

00:03:35.478 --> 00:03:37.565
one of the largest
tribes in the country --

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:39.836
putting a moratorium on genetic research.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.741
Now despite this history of distrust,

00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:47.240
I still believe that indigenous people
can benefit from genetic research.

00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:49.509
And if we don't do something soon,

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:52.400
the gap in health disparities
is going to continue to widen.

00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:54.518
Hawaii, for example,

00:03:54.542 --> 00:03:58.249
has the longest life expectancy
on average of any state in the US,

00:03:58.273 --> 00:04:01.130
yet native Hawaiians like myself

00:04:01.154 --> 00:04:04.240
die a full decade
before our non-native counterparts,

00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:08.315
because we have some
of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes,

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:09.490
obesity,

00:04:09.514 --> 00:04:12.039
and the number one and number
two killers in the US:

00:04:12.063 --> 00:04:13.902
cardiovascular disease and cancer.

00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:15.645
So how do we ensure

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.820
the populations of people
that need genome sequencing the most

00:04:18.844 --> 00:04:20.264
are not the last to benefit?

00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:25.394
My vision is to make
genetic research more native,

00:04:25.418 --> 00:04:27.829
to indigenize genome
sequencing technology.

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:31.933
Traditionally, genomes
are sequenced in laboratories.

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:35.143
Here's an image of your classic
genome sequencer.

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:36.318
It's huge.

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:38.094
It's the size of a refrigerator.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.817
There's this obvious physical limitation.

00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:44.440
But what if you could sequence
genomes on the fly?

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.511
What if you could fit a genome
sequencer in your pocket?

00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:54.246
This nanopore-based sequencer

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.755
is one 10,000th the size
of your traditional genome sequencer.

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:01.000
It doesn't have the same
physical limitations,

00:05:01.024 --> 00:05:05.300
in that it's not tethered to a lab bench
with extraneous cords,

00:05:05.324 --> 00:05:07.849
large vats of chemicals
or computer monitors.

00:05:08.456 --> 00:05:13.607
It allows us to de-black box genome
sequencing technology development

00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:16.243
in a way that's immersive
and collaborative,

00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:19.005
activating and empowering
indigenous communities ...

00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:21.917
as citizen scientists.

00:05:23.092 --> 00:05:25.648
100 years later in Kalaupapa,

00:05:25.672 --> 00:05:29.911
we now have the technology to sequence
leprosy bacteria in real time,

00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:32.823
using mobile genome sequencers,

00:05:32.847 --> 00:05:35.856
remote access to the Internet

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.292
and cloud computation.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.028
But only if that's what
Hawaiian people want.

00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:43.370
In our space,

00:05:43.394 --> 00:05:44.844
on our terms.

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:52.172
IndiGenomics is about science
for the people by the people.

00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:56.141
We'll be starting with a tribal
consultation resource,

00:05:56.165 --> 00:05:59.376
focused on educating
indigenous communities

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.419
on the potential use and misuse
of genetic information.

00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:06.171
Eventually we'd like to have our own
IndiGenomics research institute

00:06:06.195 --> 00:06:07.624
to conduct our own experiments

00:06:07.648 --> 00:06:10.783
and educate the next generation
of indigenous scientists.

00:06:11.523 --> 00:06:13.084
In the end,

00:06:13.108 --> 00:06:17.700
indigenous people need to be partners in
and not subjects of genetic research.

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:20.132
And for those on the outside,

00:06:20.156 --> 00:06:21.640
just as Father Damien did,

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:26.983
the research community needs
to immerse itself in indigenous culture

00:06:27.007 --> 00:06:28.960
or die trying.

00:06:28.984 --> 00:06:30.189
Mahalo.

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:35.213
(Applause)
