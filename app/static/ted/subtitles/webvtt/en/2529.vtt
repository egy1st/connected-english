WEBVTT

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:03.501
I'll never forget the sound

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:05.587
of laughing with my friends.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.796
I'll never forget the sound

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.275
of my mother's voice
right before I fell asleep.

00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:18.689
And I'll never forget
the comforting sound of water

00:00:18.713 --> 00:00:20.731
trickling down a stream.

00:00:22.593 --> 00:00:25.969
Imagine my fear, pure fear,

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:28.386
when, at the age of 10,

00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:31.569
I was told I was going to lose my hearing.

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:35.450
And over the next five years,

00:00:35.474 --> 00:00:40.004
it progressed until I was classified
as profoundly deaf.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.685
But I believe that losing my hearing

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:49.162
was one of the greatest gifts
I've ever received.

00:00:50.278 --> 00:00:53.924
You see, I get to experience
the world in a unique way.

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:58.929
And I believe that
these unique experiences

00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:01.340
that people with disabilities have

00:01:01.364 --> 00:01:06.384
is what's going to help us
make and design a better world

00:01:06.408 --> 00:01:11.748
for everyone -- both for people
with and without disabilities.

00:01:13.393 --> 00:01:15.419
I used to be a disability rights lawyer,

00:01:15.443 --> 00:01:19.093
and I spent a lot of my time
focused on enforcing the law,

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:21.268
ensuring that accommodations were made.

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:26.360
And then I had to quickly
learn international policy,

00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:30.266
because I was asked to work
on the UN Convention

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.593
that protects people with disabilities.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.391
As the leader of the NGO there,

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:41.073
I spent most of my energy
trying to convince people

00:01:41.097 --> 00:01:44.341
about the capabilities
of people with disabilities.

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:48.260
But somewhere along the way,

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:51.087
and after many career transitions

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.158
that my parents weren't so happy about --

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:54.768
(Laughter)

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:57.899
I stumbled upon a solution

00:01:57.923 --> 00:02:03.283
that I believe may be
an even more powerful tool

00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:06.617
to solve some of the world's
greatest problems,

00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:08.321
disability or not.

00:02:10.207 --> 00:02:14.003
And that tool is called design thinking.

00:02:15.853 --> 00:02:20.842
Design thinking is a process
for innovation and problem solving.

00:02:21.773 --> 00:02:23.549
There are five steps.

00:02:23.573 --> 00:02:26.148
The first is defining the problem

00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:29.427
and understanding its constraints.

00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:34.497
The second is observing people
in real-life situations

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.821
and empathizing with them.

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:40.815
Third, throwing out hundreds of ideas --
the more the better,

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.373
the wilder the better.

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:47.720
Fourth, prototyping:
gathering whatever you can,

00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:49.196
whatever you can find,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.819
to mimic your solution, to test it

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:53.275
and to refine it.

00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:56.409
And finally, implementation:

00:02:56.433 --> 00:03:01.491
ensuring that the solution
you came up with is sustainable.

00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:09.575
Warren Berger says that design thinking
teaches us to look sideways,

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.599
to reframe, to refine, to experiment

00:03:13.623 --> 00:03:15.970
and, probably most importantly,

00:03:15.994 --> 00:03:18.551
ask those stupid questions.

00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.686
Design thinkers believe
that everyone is creative.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.428
They believe in bringing people
from multiple disciplines together,

00:03:29.452 --> 00:03:32.667
because they want to share
multiple perspectives

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:35.107
and bring them together
and ultimately merge them

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:37.384
to form something new.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.610
Design thinking is such a successful
and versatile tool

00:03:43.634 --> 00:03:46.705
that it has been applied
in almost every industry.

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:52.961
I saw the potential that it had
for the issues I faced,

00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:56.217
so I decided to go back to school

00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:59.111
and get my master's in social design.

00:03:59.832 --> 00:04:04.971
This looks at how to use design
to create positive change in the world.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.630
While I was there,

00:04:07.654 --> 00:04:09.471
I fell in love with woodworking.

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:12.914
But what I quickly realized

00:04:12.938 --> 00:04:15.382
was that I was missing out on something.

00:04:16.058 --> 00:04:18.997
As you're working with a tool,

00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:21.450
right before it's about
to kick back at you --

00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:24.733
which means the piece or the tool
jumps back at you --

00:04:24.757 --> 00:04:25.923
it makes a sound.

00:04:26.992 --> 00:04:28.582
And I couldn't hear this sound.

00:04:29.313 --> 00:04:31.268
So I decided,

00:04:31.873 --> 00:04:33.323
why not try and solve it?

00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:37.847
My solution was a pair of safety glasses

00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:41.663
that were engineered
to visually alert the user

00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:44.279
to pitch changes in the tool,

00:04:44.303 --> 00:04:47.175
before the human ear could pick it up.

00:04:48.802 --> 00:04:52.668
Why hadn't tool designers
thought of this before?

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.595
(Laughter)

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:58.410
Two reasons: one, I was a beginner.

00:04:58.856 --> 00:05:03.411
I wasn't weighed down by expertise
or conventional wisdom.

00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:06.729
The second is: I was Deaf.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.013
My unique experience of the world
helped inform my solution.

00:05:13.886 --> 00:05:17.839
And as I went on, I kept running into
more and more solutions

00:05:17.863 --> 00:05:21.435
that were originally made
for people with disabilities,

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:24.765
and that ended up being picked up,

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.711
embraced and loved by the mainstream,

00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:28.940
disability or not.

00:05:29.448 --> 00:05:31.862
This is an OXO potato peeler.

00:05:31.886 --> 00:05:35.508
It was originally designed
for people with arthritis,

00:05:35.532 --> 00:05:37.959
but it was so comfortable,
everybody loved it.

00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:44.198
Text messaging: that was originally
designed for people who are Deaf.

00:05:44.817 --> 00:05:47.067
And as you know,
everybody loves that, too.

00:05:47.091 --> 00:05:49.009
(Laughter)

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:50.746
I started thinking:

00:05:51.492 --> 00:05:54.618
What if we changed our mindset?

00:05:55.578 --> 00:06:00.706
What if we started designing
for disability first --

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.007
not the norm?

00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:06.511
As you see, when we design
for disability first,

00:06:06.535 --> 00:06:11.356
we often stumble upon
solutions that are not only inclusive,

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.216
but also are often better
than when we design for the norm.

00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:19.953
And this excites me,

00:06:19.977 --> 00:06:26.301
because this means that the energy
it takes to accommodate someone

00:06:26.325 --> 00:06:27.926
with a disability

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.813
can be leveraged, molded and played with

00:06:32.837 --> 00:06:36.860
as a force for creativity and innovation.

00:06:37.712 --> 00:06:43.245
This moves us from the mindset
of trying to change the hearts

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:46.392
and the deficiency mindset of tolerance,

00:06:46.416 --> 00:06:49.134
to becoming an alchemist,

00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:53.128
the type of magician that this world
so desperately needs

00:06:53.152 --> 00:06:55.475
to solve some of its greatest problems.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.894
Now, I also believe

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:03.437
that people with disabilities
have great potential to be designers

00:07:03.461 --> 00:07:05.809
within this design-thinking process.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.343
Without knowing it, from a very early age,

00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:12.622
I've been a design thinker,
fine-tuning my skills.

00:07:13.621 --> 00:07:19.029
Design thinkers are, by nature,
problem solvers.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.885
So imagine listening to a conversation

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:27.902
and only understanding
50 percent of what is said.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.538
You can't ask them to repeat
every single word.

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.476
They would just get frustrated with you.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.240
So without even realizing it,

00:07:38.264 --> 00:07:43.176
my solution was to take
the muffled sound I heard,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.352
that was the beat,

00:07:44.376 --> 00:07:48.886
and turn it into a rhythm
and place it with the lips I read.

00:07:49.908 --> 00:07:55.581
Years later, someone commented
that my writing had a rhythm to it.

00:07:56.105 --> 00:08:01.066
Well, this is because I experience
conversations as rhythms.

00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:07.444
I also became really,
really good at failing.

00:08:07.468 --> 00:08:08.702
(Laughter)

00:08:08.726 --> 00:08:10.300
Quite literally.

00:08:10.801 --> 00:08:13.882
My first semester in Spanish, I got a D.

00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:18.383
But what I learned
was that when I picked myself up

00:08:18.407 --> 00:08:20.707
and changed a few things around,

00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:23.546
eventually, I succeeded.

00:08:25.187 --> 00:08:29.807
Similarly, design thinking
encourages people to fail

00:08:29.831 --> 00:08:31.467
and fail often,

00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:34.722
because eventually, you will succeed.

00:08:35.404 --> 00:08:39.284
Very few great innovations in this world

00:08:39.308 --> 00:08:43.126
have come from someone succeeding
on the first try.

00:08:44.906 --> 00:08:47.778
I also experienced this lesson in sports.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.421
I'll never forget my coach
saying to my mom,

00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:56.623
"If she just didn't have her hearing loss,

00:08:56.647 --> 00:08:58.331
she would be on the national team."

00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:04.242
But what my coach, and what I
didn't even know at the time,

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:09.723
was that my hearing loss
actually helped me excel at sports.

00:09:10.704 --> 00:09:15.771
You see, when you lose your hearing,
not only do you adapt your behavior,

00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:19.577
but you also adapt your physical senses.

00:09:20.785 --> 00:09:22.435
One example of this

00:09:22.459 --> 00:09:26.962
is that my visual
attention span increased.

00:09:27.543 --> 00:09:32.001
Imagine a soccer player,
coming down the left flank.

00:09:32.025 --> 00:09:34.828
Imagine being goalkeeper, like I was,

00:09:34.852 --> 00:09:37.000
and the ball is coming
down the left flank.

00:09:37.024 --> 00:09:41.808
A person with normal hearing
would have the visual perspective of this.

00:09:42.872 --> 00:09:46.863
I had the benefit of a spectrum this wide.

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:49.324
So I picked up the players over here,

00:09:49.348 --> 00:09:51.862
that were moving about
and coming down the field.

00:09:51.886 --> 00:09:55.560
And I picked them up quicker,
so that if the ball was passed,

00:09:55.584 --> 00:09:59.177
I could reposition myself
and be ready for that shot.

00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:02.472
So as you can see,

00:10:02.496 --> 00:10:05.162
I've been a design thinker
for nearly all my life.

00:10:06.788 --> 00:10:11.346
My observation skills have been honed
so that I pick up on things

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.353
that others would never pick up on.

00:10:15.233 --> 00:10:19.197
My constant need to adapt
has made me a great ideator

00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:20.538
and problem solver.

00:10:21.392 --> 00:10:25.664
And I've often had to do this
within limitations and constraints.

00:10:26.164 --> 00:10:30.439
This is something that designers
also have to deal with frequently.

00:10:32.638 --> 00:10:35.527
My work most recently took me to Haiti.

00:10:36.049 --> 00:10:40.238
Design thinkers often seek out
extreme situations,

00:10:40.262 --> 00:10:44.517
because that often informs
some of their best designs.

00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:47.580
And Haiti -- it was like a perfect storm.

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:52.822
I lived and worked
with 300 Deaf individuals

00:10:53.656 --> 00:10:56.775
that were relocated
after the 2010 earthquake.

00:10:57.805 --> 00:11:00.971
But five and a half years later,

00:11:01.566 --> 00:11:03.698
there still was no electricity;

00:11:03.722 --> 00:11:06.208
there still was no safe drinking water;

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:08.373
there were still no job opportunities;

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.429
there was still rampant crime,
and it went unpunished.

00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:16.540
International aid organizations
came one by one.

00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:18.351
But they came

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:21.071
with pre-determined solutions.

00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:25.482
They didn't come ready
to observe and to adapt

00:11:26.215 --> 00:11:29.511
based on the community's needs.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.789
One organization gave them
goats and chickens.

00:11:35.484 --> 00:11:36.793
But they didn't realize

00:11:36.817 --> 00:11:40.736
that there was so much hunger
in that community,

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.586
that when the Deaf went to sleep
at night and couldn't hear,

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.874
people broke into their yards
and their homes

00:11:47.898 --> 00:11:50.779
and stole these chickens and goats,

00:11:50.803 --> 00:11:53.344
and eventually they were all gone.

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:59.425
Now, if that organization
had taken the time

00:11:59.449 --> 00:12:04.186
to observe Deaf people,
to observe the community,

00:12:05.029 --> 00:12:07.249
they would have realized their problem

00:12:07.273 --> 00:12:11.669
and perhaps they would have
come up with a solution,

00:12:11.693 --> 00:12:14.771
something like a solar light,

00:12:14.795 --> 00:12:18.976
lighting up a secure pen
to put them in at night

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.380
to ensure their safety.

00:12:22.018 --> 00:12:25.989
You don't have to be a design thinker

00:12:26.013 --> 00:12:29.218
to insert the ideas
I've shared with you today.

00:12:31.387 --> 00:12:34.051
You are creative.

00:12:34.793 --> 00:12:37.295
You are a designer --

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:38.765
everyone is.

00:12:40.152 --> 00:12:43.371
Let people like me help you.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:48.855
Let people with disabilities
help you look sideways,

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:50.441
and in the process,

00:12:50.465 --> 00:12:53.074
solve some of the greatest problems.

00:12:53.605 --> 00:12:54.952
That's it. Thank you.

00:12:54.976 --> 00:13:00.492
