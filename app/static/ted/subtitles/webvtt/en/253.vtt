WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is the Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's 27 kilometers in circumference.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Over 10,000 physicists and engineers

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
from 85 countries around the world

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
have come together over several decades

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to build this machine.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What we do is we accelerate protons --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so, hydrogen nuclei --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
around 99.999999

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
percent the speed of light.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Right? At that speed, they go around

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And we collide them with another beam of protons

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
going in the opposite direction.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We collide them inside giant detectors.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
They're essentially digital cameras.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And this is the one that I work on, ATLAS.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You get some sense of the size --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
you can just see these EU standard-size

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
people underneath.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
(Laughter)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You get some sense of the size: 44 meters wide,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
22 meters in diameter, 7,000 tons.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And we re-create the conditions that were present

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
up to 600 million times a second

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
inside that detector -- immense numbers.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And if you see those metal bits there --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
those are huge magnets that bend

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
electrically charged particles,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
so it can measure how fast they're traveling.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is a picture about a year ago.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Those magnets are in there.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And, again, a EU standard-size, real person,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so you get some sense of the scale.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And it's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
sometime in the summer this year.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And actually, this morning, I got an email

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
saying that we've just finished, today,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
building the last piece of ATLAS.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So as of today, it's finished. I'd like to say

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that I planned that for TED,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but I didn't. So it's been completed as of today.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
(Applause)

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Yeah, it's a wonderful achievement.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So, you might be asking, "Why?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Why create the conditions that were present

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began?"

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Well, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And the aim of particle physics is to understand

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
what everything's made of, and how everything sticks together.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And by everything I mean, of course,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
me and you, the Earth, the Sun,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the 100 billion suns in our galaxy

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and the 100 billion galaxies

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in the observable universe.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Absolutely everything.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now you might say, "Well, OK, but why not just look at it?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You know? If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Well, we found that as you look back in time,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the universe gets hotter and hotter,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
denser and denser, and simpler and simpler.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but that seems to be the case.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So, way back in the early times of the universe,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
we believe it was very simple and understandable.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
All this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
human brains -- are a property of an old

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and cold and complicated universe.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Back at the start, in the first billionth of a second,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
we believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's almost like ...

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
imagine a snowflake in your hand,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
beautiful object. But as you heat it up,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
it'll melt into a pool of water,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
of H20, water.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So it's in that same sense that we look back in time

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to understand what the universe is made of.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And, as of today, it's made of these things.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Just 12 particles of matter,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
stuck together by four forces of nature.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
The quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that make up the atomic nuclei in your body.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The electron -- the thing that goes around

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
the atomic nucleus --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
held around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that's carried by this thing, the photon.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And these guys, here, they're the weak nuclear force,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
probably the least familiar.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And when the sun shines, you get copious quantities

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
of these things, called neutrinos, pouring out.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Actually, if you just look at your thumbnail --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
about a square centimeter --

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
from the sun, passing

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
through every square centimeter of your body.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
But you don't feel them, because the weak force

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is correctly named --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
very short range and very weak,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
so they just fly through you.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And these particles have been discovered

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
over the last century, pretty much.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
The first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in the year 2000. Actually just --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
America, isn't it?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Just up the road.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Relative to the universe, it's just up the road.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
(Laughter)

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So, this thing was discovered in the year 2000,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
so it's a relatively recent picture.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
One of the wonderful things, actually, I find,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
You know, they're a step in size

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
from the entire observable universe.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, 100 billion galaxies,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
13.7 billion light years away --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
a step in size from that to Monterey, actually,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is about the same as from Monterey to these things.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Absolutely, exquisitely minute,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So, one of my most illustrious forebears

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
at Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
discoverer of the atomic nucleus,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
once said, "All science is either physics

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
or stamp collecting."

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Now, I don't think he meant to insult

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
the rest of science,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
although he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
(Laughter)

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
But what he meant was that what we've done, really,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
is stamp collect there.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
OK, we've discovered the particles,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
but unless you understand the underlying

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
reason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Fortunately, we have

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
that underpins that pattern.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It's the Newton's laws, if you want,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
of particle physics.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
which is always the sign of elegance.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
This is it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
(Laughter)

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I've been a little disingenuous, because I've expanded it out

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
in all its gory detail.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
This equation, though, allows you to calculate everything --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
other than gravity -- that happens in the universe.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
in principle, you've got a big enough computer --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
why DNA is the shape it is.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
In principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But there's a problem.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Can anyone see what it is?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Basically, each of these terms

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
refers to some of the particles.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
These carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But there's an extra symbol in this equation: H.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Right, H.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
H stands for Higgs particle.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Higgs particles have not been discovered.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But they're necessary: they're necessary

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
to make that mathematics work.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
with that wonderful equation

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
wouldn't be possible without an extra bit.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So it's a prediction:

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
a prediction of a new particle.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
What does it do?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
for the LHC from the U.K. government,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Margaret Thatcher, at the time, said,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
"If you guys can explain, in language

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
a politician can understand,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
what the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I want to know what this Higgs particle does."

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And the picture is that the whole universe --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Higgs particles, if you will.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The analogy is that these people in a room

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
are the Higgs particles.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Now when a particle moves through the universe,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
it can interact with these Higgs particles.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Then everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
essentially at the speed of light. They're massless.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And imagine someone incredibly important

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and popular and intelligent

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
walks into the room.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
They're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
It's almost like they get heavy. They get massive.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
in your body and in the universe that we see around us

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
are heavy, in a sense, and massive,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
because they're surrounded by Higgs particles.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
They're interacting with the Higgs field.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
If that picture's true,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
If it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
although it's the simplest we've been able to think of --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
we know have to turn up

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
at the LHC.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
So, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Actually, I thought about making it more culturally relevant, but --

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
(Laughter)

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
anyway.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So that's one thing.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
There are many other things. You've heard

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
many of the big problems in particle physics.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
One of them you heard about: dark matter, dark energy.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
There's another issue,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
which is that the forces in nature -- it's quite beautiful, actually --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
seem, as you go back in time,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
they seem to change in strength.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Well, they do change in strength.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
you can calculate how these change -- is the forces,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
the three forces, other than gravity,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
almost seem to come together at one point.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It's almost as if there was one beautiful

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
kind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But they just miss.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Now there's a theory called super-symmetry,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
which doubles the number of particles in the standard model,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But actually, with this theory,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
we find that the forces of nature

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
do seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang --

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
absolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
but it seems to do it.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Also, those super-symmetric particles

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
are very strong candidates for the dark matter.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So a very compelling theory

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
that's really mainstream physics.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
in a very unscientific way -- that

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that these things would also crop up at the LHC.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Many other things that the LHC could discover.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
a different perspective

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
of what I think -- what particle physics

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
narrative -- almost a creation story,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
if you'd like -- about the universe,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
from modern science over the last few decades.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And I'd say that it deserves,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
This is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
The story goes like this: we know that

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
the universe began 13.7 billion years ago,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
in an immensely hot, dense state,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
much smaller than a single atom.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It began to expand about

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
a million, billion, billion, billion billionth

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
of a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Gravity separated away from the other forces.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
The universe then underwent

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
an exponential expansion called inflation.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
In about the first billionth of a second or so,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
the Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and the gluons and the electrons

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
that make us up got mass.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The universe continued to expand and cool.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
After about a few minutes,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
25 percent helium. It still is today.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It continued to expand

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
about 300 million years.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Then light began to travel through the universe.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
It was big enough to be transparent to light,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
that George Smoot described

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
as looking at the face of God.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
After about 400 million years, the first stars formed,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
into the heavier elements.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So the elements of life --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
carbon, and oxygen and iron,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
all the elements that we need to make us up --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
were cooked in those first generations of stars,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
which then ran out of fuel, exploded,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
threw those elements back into the universe.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
They then re-collapsed into another generation

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
of stars and planets.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
in that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
to form water, liquid water on the surface.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
primitive life evolved,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
which evolved over millions of years into

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
things that walked upright and left footprints

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and eventually

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
left a footprint on another world.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And built this civilization,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
this wonderful picture,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that turned the darkness into light,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and you can see the civilization from space.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
As one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
these are the things -- and actually, not only these,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
but I was looking around -- these are the things,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
like Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and DNA, and literature and science --

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
these are the things that hydrogen atoms do

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
when given 13.7 billion years.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Absolutely remarkable.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And, the laws of physics. Right?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So, the right laws of physics --

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
they're beautifully balanced.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
If the weak force had been a little bit different,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
inside the hearts of stars,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and there would be none of that in the universe.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And I think that's

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
a wonderful and significant story.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
because we didn't know it.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
It makes me really feel that

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that civilization --

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
which, as I say, if you believe

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
the scientific creation story,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and a few hydrogen atoms --

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
then I think, to me anyway,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
it makes me feel incredibly valuable.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So that's the LHC.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
The LHC is certainly, when it turns on in summer,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
going to write the next chapter of that book.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And I'm certainly looking forward with

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
immense excitement to it being turned on.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Thanks.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
(Applause)
