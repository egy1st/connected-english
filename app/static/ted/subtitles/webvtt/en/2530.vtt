WEBVTT

00:00:01.043 --> 00:00:04.304
What an intriguing
group of individuals you are ...

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:06.953
to a psychologist.

00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:08.416
(Laughter)

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.546
I've had the opportunity
over the last couple of days

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.156
of listening in on some
of your conversations

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:17.150
and watching you interact with each other.

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:19.699
And I think it's fair to say, already,

00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:24.911
that there are 47 people in this audience,

00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:26.712
at this moment,

00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:31.547
displaying psychological symptoms
I would like to discuss today.

00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:32.918
(Laughter)

00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:35.944
And I thought you might
like to know who you are.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.391
(Laughter)

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:39.102
But instead of pointing at you,

00:00:39.126 --> 00:00:42.324
which would be gratuitous and intrusive,

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:45.866
I thought I would tell you
a few facts and stories,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.927
in which you may catch
a glimpse of yourself.

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.325
I'm in the field of research
known as personality psychology,

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:57.789
which is part of a larger
personality science

00:00:57.813 --> 00:01:02.922
which spans the full spectrum,
from neurons to narratives.

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:04.790
And what we try to do,

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.164
in our own way,

00:01:07.188 --> 00:01:09.932
is to make sense of how each of us --

00:01:10.793 --> 00:01:12.019
each of you --

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:14.545
is, in certain respects,

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:15.932
like all other people,

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:18.377
like some other people

00:01:19.243 --> 00:01:21.261
and like no other person.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.746
Now, already you may
be saying of yourself,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.515
"I'm not intriguing.

00:01:29.597 --> 00:01:35.046
I am the 46th most boring person
in the Western Hemisphere."

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.184
Or you may say of yourself,

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:40.115
"I am intriguing,

00:01:41.252 --> 00:01:45.203
even if I am regarded by most people
as a great, thundering twit."

00:01:45.227 --> 00:01:46.417
(Laughter)

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:52.301
But it is your self-diagnosed boringness
and your inherent "twitiness"

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:56.752
that makes me, as a psychologist,
really fascinated by you.

00:01:57.172 --> 00:01:59.523
So let me explain why this is so.

00:02:00.284 --> 00:02:04.445
One of the most influential approaches
in personality science

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.059
is known as trait psychology,

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:11.452
and it aligns you along five dimensions
which are normally distributed,

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:18.466
and that describe universally held aspects
of difference between people.

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.708
They spell out the acronym OCEAN.

00:02:22.105 --> 00:02:25.156
So, "O" stands for "open to experience,"

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.531
versus those who are more closed.

00:02:27.555 --> 00:02:30.730
"C" stands for "conscientiousness,"

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:34.398
in contrast to those with a more
lackadaisical approach to life.

00:02:34.422 --> 00:02:39.065
"E" -- "extroversion," in contrast
to more introverted people.

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:41.781
"A" -- "agreeable individuals,"

00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:45.227
in contrast to those
decidedly not agreeable.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.243
And "N" -- "neurotic individuals,"

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:50.940
in contrast to those who are more stable.

00:02:52.268 --> 00:02:55.658
All of these dimensions have
implications for our well-being,

00:02:55.682 --> 00:02:58.188
for how our life goes.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:01.111
And so we know that, for example,

00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:06.110
openness and conscientiousness
are very good predictors of life success,

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.206
but the open people achieve that success
through being audacious

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.408
and, occasionally, odd.

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:18.442
The conscientious people
achieve it through sticking to deadlines,

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:22.388
to persevering, as well as
having some passion.

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:27.548
Extroversion and agreeableness
are both conducive

00:03:27.572 --> 00:03:30.150
to working well with people.

00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:33.854
Extroverts, for example,
I find intriguing.

00:03:33.878 --> 00:03:36.861
With my classes, I sometimes
give them a basic fact

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:39.852
that might be revealing
with respect to their personality:

00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:45.402
I tell them that it is virtually
impossible for adults

00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:49.263
to lick the outside of their own elbow.

00:03:49.287 --> 00:03:50.541
(Laughter)

00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:51.949
Did you know that?

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:57.694
Already, some of you have tried
to lick the outside of your own elbow.

00:03:57.718 --> 00:03:59.494
But extroverts amongst you

00:03:59.518 --> 00:04:02.129
are probably those
who have not only tried,

00:04:02.153 --> 00:04:04.643
but they have successfully
licked the elbow

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.358
of the person sitting next to them.

00:04:06.382 --> 00:04:07.384
(Laughter)

00:04:07.408 --> 00:04:09.093
Those are the extroverts.

00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:12.536
Let me deal in a bit more detail
with extroversion,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.519
because it's consequential
and it's intriguing,

00:04:15.543 --> 00:04:19.024
and it helps us understand
what I call our three natures.

00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:22.719
First, our biogenic nature --
our neurophysiology.

00:04:22.743 --> 00:04:25.726
Second, our sociogenic or second nature,

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:30.137
which has to do with the cultural
and social aspects of our lives.

00:04:30.744 --> 00:04:37.647
And third, what makes you
individually you -- idiosyncratic --

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.236
what I call your "idiogenic" nature.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.416
Let me explain.

00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:48.386
One of the things that characterizes
extroverts is they need stimulation.

00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:53.695
And that stimulation can be achieved
by finding things that are exciting:

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:57.756
loud noises, parties
and social events here at TED --

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.007
you see the extroverts
forming a magnetic core.

00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:02.690
They all gather together.

00:05:02.714 --> 00:05:04.129
And I've seen you.

00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:07.476
The introverts are more likely
to spend time in the quiet spaces

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.323
up on the second floor,

00:05:09.347 --> 00:05:13.139
where they are able
to reduce stimulation --

00:05:13.163 --> 00:05:17.098
and may be misconstrued
as being antisocial,

00:05:17.122 --> 00:05:20.120
but you're not necessarily antisocial.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.208
It may be that you simply realize
that you do better

00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:29.847
when you have a chance
to lower that level of stimulation.

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:35.146
Sometimes it's an internal
stimulant, from your body.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.085
Caffeine, for example, works much better
with extroverts than it does introverts.

00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:43.288
When extroverts come into the office
at nine o'clock in the morning

00:05:43.312 --> 00:05:46.197
and say, "I really need a cup of coffee,"

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.372
they're not kidding --

00:05:47.396 --> 00:05:48.569
they really do.

00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:51.337
Introverts do not do as well,

00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:53.878
particularly if the tasks
they're engaged in --

00:05:54.913 --> 00:05:56.458
and they've had some coffee --

00:05:56.482 --> 00:05:58.620
if those tasks are speeded,

00:05:58.644 --> 00:06:00.523
and if they're quantitative,

00:06:00.547 --> 00:06:04.941
introverts may give the appearance
of not being particularly quantitative.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.220
But it's a misconstrual.

00:06:07.244 --> 00:06:10.288
So here are the consequences
that are really quite intriguing:

00:06:10.312 --> 00:06:12.395
we're not always what seem to be,

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.703
and that takes me to my next point.

00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:18.752
I should say, before getting to this,

00:06:18.776 --> 00:06:21.456
something about sexual intercourse,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.581
although I may not have time.

00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:26.477
And so, if you would like me to --

00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:27.652
yes, you would?

00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:28.827
OK.

00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:29.936
(Laughter)

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.120
There are studies done

00:06:31.144 --> 00:06:36.469
on the frequency with which
individuals engage in the conjugal act,

00:06:37.406 --> 00:06:40.645
as broken down by male, female;
introvert, extrovert.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.251
So I ask you:

00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:44.347
How many times per minute --

00:06:45.162 --> 00:06:47.046
oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study --

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.077
(Laughter)

00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:51.953
How many times per month

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:57.974
do introverted men engage in the act?

00:06:58.486 --> 00:06:59.876
3.0.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.532
Extroverted men?

00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:03.166
More or less?

00:07:03.616 --> 00:07:05.244
Yes, more.

00:07:05.607 --> 00:07:07.974
5.5 -- almost twice as much.

00:07:09.264 --> 00:07:11.832
Introverted women: 3.1.

00:07:11.856 --> 00:07:13.452
Extroverted women?

00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:16.822
Frankly, speaking as an introverted male,

00:07:16.846 --> 00:07:18.583
which I will explain later --

00:07:18.607 --> 00:07:20.188
they are heroic.

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.748
7.5.

00:07:23.782 --> 00:07:26.134
They not only handle
all the male extroverts,

00:07:26.158 --> 00:07:28.251
they pick up a few introverts as well.

00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:30.171
(Laughter)

00:07:30.195 --> 00:07:32.515
(Applause)

00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:41.097
We communicate differently,
extroverts and introverts.

00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:44.082
Extroverts, when they interact,

00:07:44.106 --> 00:07:48.571
want to have lots of social encounter
punctuated by closeness.

00:07:48.595 --> 00:07:51.586
They'd like to stand close
for comfortable communication.

00:07:52.547 --> 00:07:54.746
They like to have a lot of eye contact,

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.114
or mutual gaze.

00:07:57.241 --> 00:07:58.448
We found in some research

00:07:58.472 --> 00:08:01.470
that they use more diminutive terms
when they meet somebody.

00:08:01.873 --> 00:08:04.586
So when an extrovert meets a Charles,

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.495
it rapidly becomes "Charlie,"
and then "Chuck,"

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:09.198
and then "Chuckles Baby."

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:10.714
(Laughter)

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.437
Whereas for introverts,

00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:17.366
it remains "Charles," until he's given
a pass to be more intimate

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.610
by the person he's talking to.

00:08:20.044 --> 00:08:22.829
We speak differently.

00:08:24.934 --> 00:08:30.171
Extroverts prefer black-and-white,
concrete, simple language.

00:08:31.854 --> 00:08:35.648
Introverts prefer --
and I must again tell you

00:08:35.672 --> 00:08:40.029
that I am as extreme an introvert
as you could possibly imagine --

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.570
we speak differently.

00:08:42.594 --> 00:08:46.589
We prefer contextually complex,

00:08:46.613 --> 00:08:48.545
contingent,

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:50.585
weasel-word sentences --

00:08:50.609 --> 00:08:51.632
(Laughter)

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.018
More or less.

00:08:53.385 --> 00:08:54.821
(Laughter)

00:08:54.845 --> 00:08:56.045
As it were.

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:57.084
(Laughter)

00:08:57.108 --> 00:08:59.108
Not to put too fine a point upon it --

00:08:59.848 --> 00:09:01.021
like that.

00:09:01.955 --> 00:09:03.357
When we talk,

00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:05.123
we sometimes talk past each other.

00:09:05.724 --> 00:09:08.352
I had a consulting contract
I shared with a colleague

00:09:08.376 --> 00:09:11.380
who's as different from me
as two people can possibly be.

00:09:11.739 --> 00:09:13.518
First, his name is Tom.

00:09:14.499 --> 00:09:15.713
Mine isn't.

00:09:15.737 --> 00:09:17.008
(Laughter)

00:09:17.032 --> 00:09:18.963
Secondly, he's six foot five.

00:09:18.987 --> 00:09:20.939
I have a tendency not to be.

00:09:20.963 --> 00:09:22.006
(Laughter)

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.753
And thirdly, he's as extroverted
a person as you could find.

00:09:25.777 --> 00:09:28.157
I am seriously introverted.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.365
I overload so much,

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:35.203
I can't even have a cup of coffee
after three in the afternoon

00:09:35.227 --> 00:09:37.515
and expect to sleep in the evening.

00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:42.130
We had seconded to this project
a fellow called Michael.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.492
And Michael almost brought
the project to a crashing halt.

00:09:48.528 --> 00:09:52.324
So the person who seconded him
asked Tom and me,

00:09:53.244 --> 00:09:54.703
"What do you make of Michael?"

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.997
Well, I'll tell you
what Tom said in a minute.

00:09:57.021 --> 00:09:59.337
He spoke in classic "extrovert-ese."

00:09:59.955 --> 00:10:03.530
And here is how extroverted ears
heard what I said,

00:10:03.554 --> 00:10:05.507
which is actually pretty accurate.

00:10:05.531 --> 00:10:09.791
I said, "Well Michael does have
a tendency at times

00:10:10.385 --> 00:10:13.671
of behaving in a way
that some of us might see

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:18.624
as perhaps more assertive
than is normally called for."

00:10:18.941 --> 00:10:21.251
(Laughter)

00:10:21.611 --> 00:10:23.388
Tom rolled his eyes and he said,

00:10:23.412 --> 00:10:25.941
"Brian, that's what I said:

00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:28.029
he's an asshole!"

00:10:28.053 --> 00:10:30.230
(Laughter)

00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:32.075
(Applause)

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:34.776
Now, as an introvert,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.981
I might gently allude to certain
"assholic" qualities

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:41.300
in this man's behavior,

00:10:41.324 --> 00:10:44.128
but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.

00:10:44.152 --> 00:10:45.928
(Laughter)

00:10:47.228 --> 00:10:48.494
But the extrovert says,

00:10:48.518 --> 00:10:51.392
"If he walks like one, if he talks
like one, I call him one."

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:52.828
And we go past each other.

00:10:53.498 --> 00:10:57.464
Now is this something
that we should be heedful of?

00:10:57.488 --> 00:10:58.654
Of course.

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:00.262
It's important that we know this.

00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:01.825
Is that all we are?

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.711
Are we just a bunch of traits?

00:11:05.563 --> 00:11:06.825
No, we're not.

00:11:08.116 --> 00:11:10.372
Remember, you're like some other people

00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:12.975
and like no other person.

00:11:13.487 --> 00:11:15.922
How about that idiosyncratic you?

00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:19.736
As Elizabeth or as George,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.640
you may share your extroversion
or your neuroticism.

00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:28.258
But are there some distinctively
Elizabethan features of your behavior,

00:11:28.282 --> 00:11:30.479
or Georgian of yours,

00:11:31.732 --> 00:11:35.582
that make us understand you
better than just a bunch of traits?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.643
That make us love you?

00:11:39.461 --> 00:11:42.455
Not just because you're
a certain type of person.

00:11:43.188 --> 00:11:45.812
I'm uncomfortable putting
people in pigeonholes.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.672
I don't even think pigeons
belong in pigeonholes.

00:11:51.235 --> 00:11:53.304
So what is it that makes us different?

00:11:54.004 --> 00:11:58.901
It's the doings that we have
in our life -- the personal projects.

00:11:59.403 --> 00:12:01.224
You have a personal project right now,

00:12:01.248 --> 00:12:04.334
but nobody may know it here.

00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:07.312
It relates to your kid --

00:12:07.336 --> 00:12:09.536
you've been back three times
to the hospital,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.456
and they still don't know what's wrong.

00:12:13.373 --> 00:12:14.697
Or it could be your mom.

00:12:16.092 --> 00:12:18.194
And you'd been acting out of character.

00:12:18.218 --> 00:12:19.780
These are free traits.

00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:24.601
You're very agreeable,
but you act disagreeably

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:28.498
in order to break down those barriers
of administrative torpor

00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:29.673
in the hospital,

00:12:29.697 --> 00:12:32.323
to get something
for your mom or your child.

00:12:33.814 --> 00:12:35.321
What are these free traits?

00:12:35.345 --> 00:12:37.915
They're where we enact a script

00:12:37.939 --> 00:12:40.592
in order to advance
a core project in our lives.

00:12:41.744 --> 00:12:43.802
And they are what matters.

00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:46.098
Don't ask people what type you are;

00:12:46.742 --> 00:12:49.496
ask them, "What are your core
projects in your life?"

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.304
And we enact those free traits.

00:12:51.328 --> 00:12:52.643
I'm an introvert,

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:57.253
but I have a core project,
which is to profess.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.848
I'm a professor.

00:12:59.798 --> 00:13:01.655
And I adore my students,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.667
and I adore my field.

00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:10.469
And I can't wait to tell them
about what's new, what's exciting,

00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:13.618
what I can't wait to tell them about.

00:13:13.642 --> 00:13:15.462
And so I act in an extroverted way,

00:13:15.486 --> 00:13:17.014
because at eight in the morning,

00:13:17.038 --> 00:13:19.382
the students need a little bit of humor,

00:13:19.406 --> 00:13:22.128
a little bit of engagement
to keep them going

00:13:22.152 --> 00:13:23.603
in arduous days of study.

00:13:24.277 --> 00:13:25.714
But we need to be very careful

00:13:26.456 --> 00:13:29.412
when we act protractedly out of character.

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:35.411
Sometimes we may find
that we don't take care of ourselves.

00:13:37.309 --> 00:13:41.923
I find, for example, after a period
of pseudo-extroverted behavior,

00:13:41.947 --> 00:13:44.247
I need to repair somewhere on my own.

00:13:45.916 --> 00:13:49.035
As Susan Cain said in her "Quiet" book,

00:13:49.059 --> 00:13:52.031
in a chapter that featured
the strange Canadian professor

00:13:52.055 --> 00:13:54.050
who was teaching at the time at Harvard,

00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:56.805
I sometimes go to the men's room

00:13:56.829 --> 00:14:00.525
to escape the slings and arrows
of outrageous extroverts.

00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:02.153
(Laughter)

00:14:02.177 --> 00:14:08.549
I remember one particular day
when I was retired to a cubicle,

00:14:08.573 --> 00:14:10.498
trying to avoid overstimulation.

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:16.364
And a real extrovert came
in beside me -- not right in my cubicle,

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:18.343
but in the next cubicle over --

00:14:18.367 --> 00:14:20.690
and I could hear various
evacuatory noises,

00:14:20.714 --> 00:14:22.983
which we hate -- even our own,

00:14:23.007 --> 00:14:25.737
that's why we flush
during as well as after.

00:14:25.761 --> 00:14:27.493
(Laughter)

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.950
And then I heard
this gravelly voice saying,

00:14:32.974 --> 00:14:35.409
"Hey, is that Dr. Little?"

00:14:35.433 --> 00:14:37.362
(Laughter)

00:14:38.664 --> 00:14:45.031
If anything is guaranteed
to constipate an introvert for six months,

00:14:45.055 --> 00:14:46.816
it's talking on the john.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.070
(Laughter)

00:14:48.094 --> 00:14:50.194
That's where I'm going now.

00:14:50.696 --> 00:14:52.052
Don't follow me.

00:14:52.564 --> 00:14:53.743
Thank you.

00:14:53.767 --> 00:15:02.885
(Applause)
