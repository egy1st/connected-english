00:00:00.771 --> 00:00:03.018
When we're designing new products,

00:00:03.042 --> 00:00:05.032
services or businesses,

00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:07.574
the only time you'll know
if they're any good,

00:00:07.598 --> 00:00:09.296
if the designs are good,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.055
is to see how they're used
in the real world, in context.

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.695
I'm reminded of that every time
I walk past Highbury Fields

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.159
in north London.

00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:21.501
It's absolutely beautiful.

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:23.222
There's a big open green space.

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:25.814
There's Georgian buildings
around the side.

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:28.736
But then there's this mud trap
that cuts across the middle.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.844
People clearly don't want to walk
all the way around the edge.

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:35.332
Instead, they want to take the shortcut,

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:37.812
and that shortcut is self-reinforcing.

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:42.162
Now, this shortcut
is called a desire path,

00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:44.686
and it's often the path
of least resistance.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.043
I find them fascinating,

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:51.532
because they're often the point
where design and user experience diverge.

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:54.017
Now at this point, I should apologize,

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:56.913
because you guys are going to start
seeing these everywhere.

00:00:56.937 --> 00:00:59.599
But today, I'm going to pick
three I find interesting

00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:01.734
and share what actually it reminds me

00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:04.566
about launching new products and services.

00:01:05.137 --> 00:01:08.800
The first is in the capital city
of Brazil -- Brasilia.

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:11.341
And it reminds me that sometimes,

00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:14.493
you have to just focus
on designing for a real need

00:01:14.517 --> 00:01:15.786
at low friction.

00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:17.764
Now, Brasilia is fascinating.

00:01:17.788 --> 00:01:20.930
It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s.

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:23.162
It was the golden age of flying,

00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:26.450
so he laid it out like a plane,
as you can see there.

00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:27.639
Slightly worryingly,

00:01:27.663 --> 00:01:31.411
he put most of the important
government buildings in the cockpit.

00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:33.882
But if you zoom in,
in the very center of Brasilia,

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.068
just where the point is there,

00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:38.492
you see it's littered with desire paths.

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.046
They're absolutely everywhere.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.940
Now, they thought that they
had future-proofed this design.

00:01:43.964 --> 00:01:46.979
They thought in the future
we wouldn't need to walk anywhere --

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:48.551
we'd be able to drive --

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.532
so there was little need
for walkways or pavements.

00:01:52.358 --> 00:01:54.691
But as you can see, there's a real need.

00:01:55.564 --> 00:01:57.386
These are very dangerous desire paths.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.447
If we just pick one, in the middle,

00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:02.878
you can see it crosses
15 lanes of traffic.

00:02:02.902 --> 00:02:04.658
It won't surprise you guys

00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:08.222
that Brasilia has five times
the pedestrian accident rate

00:02:08.246 --> 00:02:10.124
of your average US city.

00:02:10.968 --> 00:02:12.455
People are resourceful.

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.513
They'll always find the low-friction route

00:02:15.537 --> 00:02:17.932
to save money, save time.

00:02:18.493 --> 00:02:20.476
Not all these desire paths are dangerous,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.893
I was reminded flying here
when I was in Heathrow.

00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:26.437
Many of us get frustrated
when we're confronted

00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:29.130
with the obligatory walk
through duty-free.

00:02:31.024 --> 00:02:32.175
It was amazing to me

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.334
how many people refused to take
the long, meandering path to the left,

00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:38.435
and just cut through to the right,

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.180
cut through the desire path.

00:02:40.813 --> 00:02:42.521
The question that's interesting is:

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:45.735
What do designers think
when they see our behavior here?

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:47.989
Do they think we're stupid?

00:02:48.013 --> 00:02:49.809
Do they think we're lazy?

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:52.957
Or do they accept
that this is the only truth?

00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:54.739
This is their product.

00:02:55.134 --> 00:02:57.667
We're effectively
co-designing their product.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.466
So our job is to design
for real needs at low friction,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.386
because if you don't,
the customer will, anyway.

00:03:07.238 --> 00:03:09.458
The second desire path I wanted to share

00:03:09.482 --> 00:03:11.734
is at the University of California.

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:12.910
And it reminds me

00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:16.092
that sometimes the best way
to come up with a great design

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:17.800
is just to launch it.

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:22.738
Now, university campuses are fantastic
for spotting desire paths.

00:03:22.762 --> 00:03:26.100
I think it's because students
are always late and they're pretty smart.

00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:27.606
So they're dashing to lectures.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.723
They'll always find the shortcut.

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:32.506
And the designers here knew that.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.503
So they built the buildings

00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:37.441
and then they waited a few months
for the paths to form.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.354
They then paved them.

00:03:39.378 --> 00:03:40.417
(Laughter)

00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:42.346
Incredibly smart approach.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.842
In fact, often, just launching
the straw man of a service

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:48.007
can teach you what people really want.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:52.861
For example, Ayr Muir in Boston
knew he wanted to open a restaurant.

00:03:52.885 --> 00:03:54.293
But where should it be?

00:03:54.675 --> 00:03:56.236
What should the menu be?

00:03:56.661 --> 00:03:58.150
He launched a service,

00:03:58.174 --> 00:03:59.860
in this case a food truck,

00:03:59.884 --> 00:04:02.259
and he changed the location each day.

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:05.827
He'd write a different menu
on the side in a whiteboard marker

00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:07.763
to figure out what people wanted.

00:04:08.218 --> 00:04:10.637
He now has a chain of restaurants.

00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:12.692
So it can be incredibly efficient

00:04:12.716 --> 00:04:15.481
to launch something
to spot the desire paths.

00:04:16.232 --> 00:04:19.314
The third and final desire path
I wanted to share with you

00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:20.961
is the UNIH.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.883
It reminds me that the world's in flux,

00:04:23.907 --> 00:04:26.207
and we have to respond to those changes.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.837
So as you'll guess, this is a hospital.

00:04:29.337 --> 00:04:32.378
I've marked for you on the left
the Oncology Department.

00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:37.083
The patients would usually stay
in the hotels down on the bottom right.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.243
This was a patient-centered organization,

00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:42.895
so they laid on cars for their patients.

00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:47.263
But what they realized when they started
offering chemotherapy

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.064
is the patients rarely
wanted to get in cars.

00:04:50.088 --> 00:04:53.990
They were too nauseous,
so they'd walk back to their hotels.

00:04:54.014 --> 00:04:56.953
This desire path that you see
diagonally, formed.

00:04:57.616 --> 00:05:00.133
The patients even called it
"The Chemo Trail."

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.999
Now, when the hospital
saw this originally,

00:05:03.023 --> 00:05:05.917
they tried to lay turf
back over it, ignore it.

00:05:06.744 --> 00:05:09.860
But after a while, they realized
it was an important need

00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:11.661
they were meeting for their patients,

00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:12.993
so they paved it.

00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:16.866
And I think our job is often
to pave these emerging desire paths.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.016
If we look back at the one
in North London again,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.410
that desire path hasn't always been there.

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.372
The reason it sprung up

00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:28.494
is people were traveling to the mighty
Arsenal Football Club stadium

00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:29.669
on game days,

00:05:29.693 --> 00:05:32.470
from the Underground station
you see on the bottom right.

00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:34.104
So you see the desire path.

00:05:34.128 --> 00:05:36.942
If we just wind the clock
back a few years,

00:05:36.966 --> 00:05:39.163
when the stadium was being constructed,

00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:40.746
there is no desire path.

00:05:41.797 --> 00:05:45.943
So our job is to watch
for these desire paths emerging,

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:48.331
and, where appropriate, pave them,

00:05:48.975 --> 00:05:50.530
as someone did here.

00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:52.839
Someone installed a barrier,

00:05:54.076 --> 00:05:57.296
people started walking across
and round the bottom as you see,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.518
and they paved it.

00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:00.122
(Laughter)

00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:02.534
But I think this is a wonderful
reminder as well,

00:06:02.558 --> 00:06:04.410
that, actually, the world is in flux.

00:06:04.434 --> 00:06:05.656
It's constantly changing,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.912
because if you look
at the top of this image,

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:09.928
there's another desire path forming.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.943
So these three desire paths remind me

00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:17.114
we need to design for real human needs.

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:20.062
I think empathy for what
your customers want

00:06:20.086 --> 00:06:23.820
is probably the biggest leading indicator
of business success.

00:06:24.315 --> 00:06:25.989
Design for real needs

00:06:26.013 --> 00:06:28.417
and design them in low friction,

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:31.790
because if you don't offer them
in low friction,

00:06:31.814 --> 00:06:34.409
someone else will, often the customer.

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:39.035
Secondly, often the best way
to learn what people really want

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:40.923
is to launch your service.

00:06:40.947 --> 00:06:43.727
The answer is rarely inside the building.

00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:46.224
Get out there and see
what people really want.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:49.149
And finally, in part
because of technology,

00:06:49.173 --> 00:06:51.986
the world is incredibly flux
at the moment.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.969
It's changing constantly.

00:06:53.993 --> 00:06:57.238
These desire paths are going
to spring up faster than ever.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.677
Our job is to pick the appropriate ones

00:07:00.701 --> 00:07:01.946
and pave over them.

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:03.723
Thank you very much.

00:07:03.747 --> 00:07:07.712
(Applause)
