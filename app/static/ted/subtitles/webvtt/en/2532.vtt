WEBVTT

00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:04.896
Every weekend for as long
as I can remember,

00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:07.953
my father would get up on a Saturday,

00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:10.443
put on a worn sweatshirt

00:00:11.163 --> 00:00:12.318
and he'd scrape away

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:15.165
at the squeaky old wheel
of a house that we lived in.

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.469
I wouldn't even call it restoration;

00:00:17.493 --> 00:00:19.428
it was a ritual, catharsis.

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:23.266
He would spend all year
scraping paint with this old heat gun

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.534
and a spackle knife,

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.635
and then he would repaint
where he scraped,

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.028
only to begin again the following year.

00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:32.118
Scraping and re-scraping,
painting and repainting:

00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:35.632
the work of an old house
is never meant to be done.

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.921
The day my father turned 52,
I got a phone call.

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:42.367
My mother was on the line

00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:46.129
to tell me that doctors had found
a lump in his stomach --

00:00:46.153 --> 00:00:48.172
terminal cancer, she told me,

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:50.790
and he had been given
only three weeks to live.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.790
I immediately moved home
to Poughkeepsie, New York,

00:00:55.814 --> 00:00:58.222
to sit with my father on death watch,

00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:00.638
not knowing what the next days
would bring us.

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:02.896
To keep myself distracted,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.674
I rolled up my sleeves,

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:08.603
and I went about finishing
what he could now no longer complete --

00:01:08.627 --> 00:01:11.019
the restoration of our old home.

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.707
When that looming three-week deadline came

00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.889
and then went,

00:01:15.913 --> 00:01:17.544
he was still alive.

00:01:17.904 --> 00:01:19.386
And at three months,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.576
he joined me.

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:23.576
We gutted and repainted the interior.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.894
At six months, the old windows
were refinished,

00:01:26.918 --> 00:01:28.213
and at 18 months,

00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:30.886
the rotted porch was finally replaced.

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.403
And there was my father,

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:36.680
standing with me outside,
admiring a day's work,

00:01:36.704 --> 00:01:39.257
hair on his head, fully in remission,

00:01:39.727 --> 00:01:41.961
when he turned to me and he said,

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:43.142
"You know, Michael,

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.115
this house saved my life."

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:51.360
So the following year, I decided
to go to architecture school.

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:53.317
(Laughter)

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.049
But there, I learned
something different about buildings.

00:01:57.073 --> 00:01:58.704
Recognition seemed to come

00:01:58.728 --> 00:02:02.279
to those who prioritized
novel and sculptural forms,

00:02:02.303 --> 00:02:04.775
like ribbons, or ...

00:02:05.514 --> 00:02:06.673
pickles?

00:02:06.697 --> 00:02:09.006
(Laughter)

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:13.357
And I think this
is supposed to be a snail.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.264
Something about this bothered me.

00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:20.914
Why was it that the best architects,
the greatest architecture --

00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:23.540
all beautiful and visionary
and innovative --

00:02:24.078 --> 00:02:26.249
is also so rare,

00:02:26.273 --> 00:02:28.720
and seems to serve so very few?

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:31.212
And more to the point:

00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:34.691
With all of this creative talent,
what more could we do?

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:38.865
Just as I was about to start
my final exams,

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.589
I decided to take a break
from an all-nighter

00:02:42.018 --> 00:02:44.930
and go to a lecture by Dr. Paul Farmer,

00:02:45.514 --> 00:02:48.510
a leading health activist
for the global poor.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:52.316
I was surprised to hear a doctor
talking about architecture.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.822
Buildings are making
people sicker, he said,

00:02:54.846 --> 00:02:56.639
and for the poorest in the world,

00:02:56.663 --> 00:02:59.559
this is causing epidemic-level problems.

00:02:59.918 --> 00:03:01.553
In this hospital in South Africa,

00:03:01.577 --> 00:03:03.761
patients that came in
with, say, a broken leg,

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:06.381
to wait in this unventilated hallway,

00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:10.932
walked out with a multidrug-resistant
strand of tuberculosis.

00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:14.918
Simple designs for infection control
had not been thought about,

00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:17.460
and people had died because of it.

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:21.164
"Where are the architects?" Paul said.

00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:23.693
If hospitals are making people sicker,

00:03:23.717 --> 00:03:25.621
where are the architects and designers

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:30.255
to help us build and design
hospitals that allow us to heal?

00:03:32.486 --> 00:03:34.126
That following summer,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.952
I was in the back of a Land Rover
with a few classmates,

00:03:36.976 --> 00:03:40.457
bumping over the mountainous
hillside of Rwanda.

00:03:40.964 --> 00:03:44.933
For the next year, I'd be living in Butaro
in this old guesthouse,

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:48.154
which was a jail after the genocide.

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:52.888
I was there to design and build
a new type of hospital

00:03:52.912 --> 00:03:55.106
with Dr. Farmer and his team.

00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:58.099
If hallways are making patients sicker,

00:03:58.123 --> 00:04:01.877
what if we could design a hospital
that flips the hallways on the outside,

00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.219
and makes people walk in the exterior?

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:06.612
If mechanical systems rarely work,

00:04:06.636 --> 00:04:09.219
what if we could design a hospital
that could breathe

00:04:09.243 --> 00:04:11.119
through natural ventilation,

00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:14.285
and meanwhile reduce
its environmental footprint?

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:16.865
And what about the patients' experience?

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.205
Evidence shows
that a simple view of nature

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.388
can radically improve health outcomes,

00:04:21.752 --> 00:04:23.814
So why couldn't we design a hospital

00:04:23.838 --> 00:04:26.551
where every patient
had a window with a view?

00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:31.987
Simple, site-specific designs
can make a hospital that heals.

00:04:32.764 --> 00:04:34.547
Designing it is one thing;

00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:36.797
getting it built, we learned,
is quite another.

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:40.303
We worked with Bruce Nizeye,

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:41.840
a brilliant engineer,

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.988
and he thought about
construction differently

00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:45.868
than I had been taught in school.

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.782
When we had to excavate
this enormous hilltop

00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:51.741
and a bulldozer was expensive
and hard to get to site,

00:04:51.765 --> 00:04:54.285
Bruce suggested doing it by hand,

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:57.983
using a method in Rwanda called "Ubudehe,"

00:04:58.007 --> 00:05:00.556
which means "community works
for the community."

00:05:01.082 --> 00:05:04.406
Hundreds of people came
with shovels and hoes,

00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:06.795
and we excavated that hill

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:10.428
in half the time and half
the cost of that bulldozer.

00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:14.268
Instead of importing furniture,
Bruce started a guild,

00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:16.699
and he brought in
master carpenters to train others

00:05:16.723 --> 00:05:18.477
in how to make furniture by hand.

00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:20.071
And on this job site,

00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:23.584
15 years after the Rwandan genocide,

00:05:24.326 --> 00:05:27.931
Bruce insisted that we bring on
labor from all backgrounds,

00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:29.867
and that half of them be women.

00:05:30.302 --> 00:05:32.947
Bruce was using
the process of building to heal,

00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:34.956
not just for those who were sick,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.678
but for the entire community as a whole.

00:05:39.086 --> 00:05:43.941
We call this the locally fabricated
way of building, or "lo-fab,"

00:05:43.965 --> 00:05:46.321
and it has four pillars:

00:05:46.984 --> 00:05:48.158
hire locally,

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:49.617
source regionally,

00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:51.531
train where you can

00:05:51.555 --> 00:05:53.119
and most importantly,

00:05:53.143 --> 00:05:56.705
think about every design decision
as an opportunity

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.645
to invest in the dignity
of the places where you serve.

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:04.049
Think of it like the local food movement,

00:06:04.073 --> 00:06:05.428
but for architecture.

00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:07.944
And we're convinced
that this way of building

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:09.906
can be replicated across the world,

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.477
and change the way we talk about
and evaluate architecture.

00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:17.207
Using the lo-fab way of building,

00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:21.027
even aesthetic decisions
can be designed to impact people's lives.

00:06:21.762 --> 00:06:24.464
In Butaro, we chose to use
a local volcanic stone

00:06:24.488 --> 00:06:26.516
found in abundance within the area,

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.577
but often considered
a nuisance by farmers,

00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:30.330
and piled on the side of the road.

00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:33.155
We worked with these masons
to cut these stones

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:36.370
and form them into the walls
of the hospital.

00:06:36.394 --> 00:06:38.591
And when they began on this corner

00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:41.703
and wrapped around the entire hospital,

00:06:42.283 --> 00:06:44.805
they were so good at putting
these stones together,

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:48.441
they asked us if they could take down
the original wall and rebuild it.

00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:50.753
And you see what is possible.

00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:52.700
It's beautiful.

00:06:53.794 --> 00:06:55.673
And the beauty, to me,

00:06:55.697 --> 00:06:58.915
comes from the fact that I know
that hands cut these stones,

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:02.420
and they formed them into this thick wall,

00:07:02.444 --> 00:07:06.434
made only in this place
with rocks from this soil.

00:07:08.107 --> 00:07:12.208
When you go outside today
and you look at your built world,

00:07:12.973 --> 00:07:14.154
ask not only:

00:07:14.178 --> 00:07:17.404
"What is the environmental footprint?" --
an important question --

00:07:17.428 --> 00:07:18.702
but what if we also asked,

00:07:18.726 --> 00:07:22.382
"What is the human handprint
of those who made it?"

00:07:23.427 --> 00:07:27.071
We started a new practice
based around these questions,

00:07:27.095 --> 00:07:29.644
and we tested it around the world.

00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:31.618
Like in Haiti,

00:07:31.642 --> 00:07:36.241
where we asked if a new hospital
could help end the epidemic of cholera.

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:38.394
In this 100-bed hospital,

00:07:38.418 --> 00:07:40.093
we designed a simple strategy

00:07:40.117 --> 00:07:44.577
to clean contaminated medical waste
before it enters the water table,

00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:46.609
and our partners at Les Centres GHESKIO

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.163
are already saving lives because of it.

00:07:49.187 --> 00:07:50.382
Or Malawi:

00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:53.635
we asked if a birthing center
could radically reduce

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:55.559
maternal and infant mortality.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:59.145
Malawi has one of the highest rates
of maternal and infant death

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:00.386
in the world.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.733
Using a simple strategy
to be replicated nationally,

00:08:03.757 --> 00:08:05.977
we designed a birthing center

00:08:06.001 --> 00:08:08.309
that would attract women
and their attendants

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:12.166
to come to the hospital earlier
and therefore have safer births.

00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:14.243
Or in the Congo, where we asked

00:08:14.267 --> 00:08:16.515
if an educational center
could also be used

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:18.721
to protect endangered wildlife.

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:20.330
Poaching for ivory and bushmeat

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:23.901
is leading to global epidemic,
disease transfer and war.

00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:27.147
In one of the hardest-to-reach
places in the world,

00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:30.097
we used the mud and the dirt
and the wood around us

00:08:30.121 --> 00:08:31.785
to construct a center

00:08:31.809 --> 00:08:36.557
that would show us ways to protect
and conserve our rich biodiversity.

00:08:37.526 --> 00:08:39.131
Even here in the US,

00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:40.418
we were asked to rethink

00:08:40.442 --> 00:08:44.504
the largest university for the deaf
and hard of hearing in the world.

00:08:44.844 --> 00:08:47.100
The deaf community, through sign language,

00:08:47.124 --> 00:08:49.534
shows us the power
of visual communication.

00:08:49.558 --> 00:08:51.810
We designed a campus
that would awaken the ways

00:08:51.834 --> 00:08:53.883
in which we as humans all communicate,

00:08:53.907 --> 00:08:55.826
both verbally and nonverbally.

00:08:57.729 --> 00:09:00.263
And even in Poughkeepsie, my hometown,

00:09:00.986 --> 00:09:03.826
we thought about old
industrial infrastructure.

00:09:04.196 --> 00:09:05.473
We wondered:

00:09:05.497 --> 00:09:10.060
Could we use arts and culture
and design to revitalize this city

00:09:10.084 --> 00:09:12.706
and other Rust Belt cities
across our nation,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.694
and turn them into centers
for innovation and growth?

00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:19.550
In each of these projects,
we asked a simple question:

00:09:20.045 --> 00:09:22.224
What more can architecture do?

00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:24.606
And by asking that question,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.372
we were forced to consider
how we could create jobs,

00:09:28.396 --> 00:09:30.807
how we could source regionally

00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:34.057
and how we could invest
in the dignity of the communities

00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:35.312
in which we serve.

00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:37.206
I have learned

00:09:37.943 --> 00:09:42.498
that architecture can be
a transformative engine for change.

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:47.790
About a year ago, I read an article

00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:52.711
about a tireless and intrepid
civil rights leader

00:09:53.328 --> 00:09:54.634
named Bryan Stevenson.

00:09:56.423 --> 00:10:00.420
(Applause)

00:10:02.249 --> 00:10:05.433
And Bryan had a bold architectural vision.

00:10:05.983 --> 00:10:08.572
He and his team had been documenting

00:10:08.596 --> 00:10:12.240
the over 4,000 lynchings
of African-Americans

00:10:12.264 --> 00:10:14.524
that have happened in the American South.

00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:19.699
And they had a plan to mark every county
where these lynchings occurred,

00:10:19.723 --> 00:10:23.112
and build a national memorial
to the victims of lynching

00:10:23.136 --> 00:10:24.826
in Montgomery, Alabama.

00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:28.976
Countries like Germany and South Africa

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.049
and, of course, Rwanda,

00:10:31.073 --> 00:10:34.145
have found it necessary to build memorials

00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:37.008
to reflect on the atrocities
of their past,

00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:40.020
in order to heal their national psyche.

00:10:40.044 --> 00:10:43.212
We have yet to do this
in the United States.

00:10:44.679 --> 00:10:51.314
So I sent a cold email
to info@equaljusticeintiative.org:

00:10:51.338 --> 00:10:53.287
"Dear Bryan," it said,

00:10:54.102 --> 00:10:55.738
"I think your building project

00:10:55.762 --> 00:10:58.717
is maybe the most important
project we could do in America

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.731
and could change the way
we think about racial injustice.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.624
By any chance,

00:11:04.648 --> 00:11:06.569
do you know who will design it?"

00:11:06.593 --> 00:11:08.222
(Laughter)

00:11:08.784 --> 00:11:10.511
Surprisingly, shockingly,

00:11:11.547 --> 00:11:12.861
Bryan got right back to me,

00:11:12.885 --> 00:11:16.093
and invited me down to meet
with his team and talk to them.

00:11:16.763 --> 00:11:18.815
Needless to say,
I canceled all my meetings

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:21.179
and I jumped on a plane
to Montgomery, Alabama.

00:11:21.203 --> 00:11:22.361
When I got there,

00:11:22.797 --> 00:11:26.281
Bryan and his team picked me up,
and we walked around the city.

00:11:26.305 --> 00:11:28.632
And they took the time to point out

00:11:28.656 --> 00:11:31.677
the many markers that have
been placed all over the city

00:11:31.701 --> 00:11:34.145
to the history of the Confederacy,

00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:38.396
and the very few that mark
the history of slavery.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.247
And then he walked me to a hill.

00:11:40.828 --> 00:11:42.330
It overlooked the whole city.

00:11:42.934 --> 00:11:45.164
He pointed out the river
and the train tracks

00:11:45.188 --> 00:11:47.883
where the largest domestic
slave-trading port in America

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:49.091
had once prospered.

00:11:49.115 --> 00:11:50.733
And then to the Capitol rotunda,

00:11:50.757 --> 00:11:52.829
where George Wallace
had stood on its steps

00:11:52.853 --> 00:11:55.737
and proclaimed, "Segregation forever."

00:11:56.205 --> 00:11:58.056
And then to the very hill below us.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.397
He said, "Here we will build
a new memorial

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.863
that will change the identity
of this city and of this nation."

00:12:06.855 --> 00:12:10.309
Our two teams have worked
together over the last year

00:12:10.333 --> 00:12:11.975
to design this memorial.

00:12:15.184 --> 00:12:18.051
The memorial will take us on a journey

00:12:18.836 --> 00:12:21.910
through a classical,
almost familiar building type,

00:12:21.934 --> 00:12:26.059
like the Parthenon
or the colonnade at the Vatican.

00:12:26.994 --> 00:12:28.321
But as we enter,

00:12:28.345 --> 00:12:32.306
the ground drops below us
and our perception shifts,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.424
where we realize that these columns
evoke the lynchings,

00:12:36.448 --> 00:12:38.479
which happened in the public square.

00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:40.321
And as we continue,

00:12:40.345 --> 00:12:43.440
we begin to understand the vast number

00:12:43.464 --> 00:12:46.457
of those who have yet to be put to rest.

00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:51.186
Their names will be engraved
on the markers that hang above us.

00:12:52.202 --> 00:12:56.271
And just outside will be a field
of identical columns.

00:12:56.973 --> 00:13:00.772
But these are temporary columns,
waiting in purgatory,

00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:04.619
to be placed in the very counties
where these lynchings occurred.

00:13:06.124 --> 00:13:08.496
Over the next few years,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.506
this site will bear witness,

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.298
as each of these markers is claimed

00:13:13.322 --> 00:13:15.581
and visibly placed in those counties.

00:13:16.258 --> 00:13:21.426
Our nation will begin to heal
from over a century of silence.

00:13:23.799 --> 00:13:25.852
When we think about
how it should be built,

00:13:25.876 --> 00:13:28.676
we were reminded of Ubudehe,

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.068
the building process
we learned about in Rwanda.

00:13:31.562 --> 00:13:34.106
We wondered if we could fill
those very columns

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:38.029
with the soil from the sites
of where these killings occurred.

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:42.382
Brian and his team have begun
collecting that soil

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.724
and preserving it in individual jars

00:13:45.748 --> 00:13:49.207
with family members, community
leaders and descendants.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.992
The act of collecting soil itself

00:13:54.148 --> 00:13:56.818
has lead to a type of spiritual healing.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.032
It's an act of restorative justice.

00:14:00.844 --> 00:14:03.398
As one EJI team member noted

00:14:03.422 --> 00:14:07.474
in the collection of the soil
from where Will McBride was lynched,

00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:11.364
"If Will McBride left one drop of sweat,

00:14:11.388 --> 00:14:12.743
one drop of blood,

00:14:13.173 --> 00:14:14.576
one hair follicle --

00:14:14.964 --> 00:14:16.585
I pray that I dug it up,

00:14:16.609 --> 00:14:19.584
and that his whole body
would be at peace."

00:14:22.683 --> 00:14:25.944
We plan to break ground
on this memorial later this year,

00:14:25.968 --> 00:14:30.413
and it will be a place to finally speak
of the unspeakable acts

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:32.292
that have scarred this nation.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:40.241
(Applause)

00:14:45.245 --> 00:14:48.682
When my father told me
that day that this house --

00:14:48.706 --> 00:14:49.861
our house --

00:14:49.885 --> 00:14:51.090
had saved his life,

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.282
what I didn't know

00:14:53.306 --> 00:14:56.558
was that he was referring
to a much deeper relationship

00:14:56.582 --> 00:14:59.022
between architecture and ourselves.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:02.995
Buildings are not simply
expressive sculptures.

00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:07.117
They make visible our personal
and our collective aspirations

00:15:07.141 --> 00:15:08.298
as a society.

00:15:09.177 --> 00:15:12.417
Great architecture can give us hope.

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:15.536
Great architecture can heal.

00:15:16.478 --> 00:15:17.695
Thank you very much.

00:15:17.719 --> 00:15:24.990
(Applause)
