00:00:01.163 --> 00:00:03.429
Once there was a star.

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:06.804
Like everything else, she was born;

00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:10.609
grew to be around 30 times
the mass of our sun

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:12.926
and lived for a very long time.

00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:14.843
Exactly how long,

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:16.606
people cannot really tell.

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:18.941
Just like everything in life,

00:00:18.965 --> 00:00:22.414
she reached the end
of her regular star days

00:00:22.438 --> 00:00:25.015
when her heart, the core of her life,

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.505
exhausted its fuel.

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:28.212
But that was no end.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:31.762
She transformed into a supernova,
and in the process

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:34.440
releasing a tremendous amount of energy,

00:00:34.464 --> 00:00:37.172
outshining the rest of the galaxy

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:39.530
and emitting, in one second,

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:43.627
the same amount of energy
our sun will release in 10 days.

00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:46.922
And she evolved
into another role in our galaxy.

00:00:47.783 --> 00:00:50.257
Supernova explosions are very extreme.

00:00:50.638 --> 00:00:54.858
But the ones that emit gamma rays
are even more extreme.

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:57.706
In the process of becoming a supernova,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.153
the interior of the star collapses
under its own weight

00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:04.065
and it starts rotating ever faster,

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.954
like an ice skater when pulling
their arms in close to their body.

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:13.050
In that way, it starts rotating very fast
and it increases, powerfully,

00:01:13.074 --> 00:01:14.634
its magnetic field.

00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:18.100
The matter around the star
is dragged around,

00:01:18.124 --> 00:01:21.442
and some energy from that rotation
is transferred to that matter

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.874
and the magnetic field
is increased even further.

00:01:25.477 --> 00:01:31.239
In that way, our star had extra energy
to outshine the rest of the galaxy

00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:33.566
in brightness and gamma ray emission.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.608
My star, the one in my story,

00:01:36.632 --> 00:01:39.280
became what is known as a magnetar.

00:01:39.304 --> 00:01:40.985
And just for your information,

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.890
the magnetic field of a magnetar
is 1,000 trillion times

00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:46.683
the magnetic field of Earth.

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:50.609
The most energetic events
ever measured by astronomers

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:52.888
carry the name gamma-ray bursts

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:56.519
because we observe them
as bursts most or explosions,

00:01:56.543 --> 00:01:59.076
most strongly measured as gamma-ray light.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:04.091
Our star, like the one in our story
that became a magnetar,

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.186
is detected as a gamma-ray burst

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.770
during the most energetic
portion of the explosion.

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:15.468
Yet, even though gamma-ray bursts
are the strongest events

00:02:15.492 --> 00:02:17.581
ever measured by astronomers,

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:20.242
we cannot see them with our naked eye.

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:22.594
We depend, we rely on other methods

00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:25.407
in order to study this gamma-ray light.

00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:27.278
We cannot see them with our naked eye.

00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:30.372
We can only see
an itty bitty, tiny portion

00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:34.122
of the electromagnetic spectrum
that we call visible light.

00:02:34.146 --> 00:02:36.418
And beyond that, we rely on other methods.

00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:41.702
Yet as astronomers,
we study a wider range of light

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:44.490
and we depend on other methods to do that.

00:02:44.514 --> 00:02:47.090
On the screen, it may look like this.

00:02:47.812 --> 00:02:49.544
You're seeing a plot.

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:51.493
That is a light curve.

00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:55.066
It's a plot of intensity
of light over time.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.554
It is a gamma-ray light curve.

00:02:58.013 --> 00:03:01.705
Sighted astronomers
depend on this kind of plot

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:06.401
in order to interpret how
this light intensity changes over time.

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:12.449
On the left, you will be seeing
the light intensity without a burst,

00:03:12.473 --> 00:03:16.628
and on the right, you will be seeing
the light intensity with the burst.

00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:22.082
Early during my career,
I could also see this kind of plot.

00:03:22.562 --> 00:03:25.290
But then, I lost my sight.

00:03:25.314 --> 00:03:28.466
I completely lost my sight
because of extended illness,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.175
and with it, I lost
the opportunity to see this plot

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:35.965
and the opportunity to do my physics.

00:03:37.672 --> 00:03:40.127
It was a very strong transition
for me in many ways.

00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:45.540
And professionally, it left me
without a way to do my science.

00:03:45.564 --> 00:03:50.179
I longed to access and scrutinize
this energetic light

00:03:50.203 --> 00:03:52.889
and figure out the astrophysical cause.

00:03:52.913 --> 00:03:56.375
I wanted to experience
the spacious wonder, the excitement,

00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:00.848
the joy produced by the detection
of such a titanic celestial event.

00:04:01.352 --> 00:04:04.652
I thought long and hard about it,

00:04:04.676 --> 00:04:08.361
when I suddenly realized
that all a light curve is,

00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:12.226
is a table of numbers
converted into a visual plot.

00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:14.762
So along with my collaborators,

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:18.994
we worked really hard and we translated
the numbers into sound.

00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:21.769
I achieved access to the data,

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:26.806
and today I'm able to do physics
at the level of the best astronomer,

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.981
using sound.

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:30.633
And what people have been able to do,

00:04:30.657 --> 00:04:31.810
mainly visually,

00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:33.178
for hundreds of years,

00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:35.544
now I do it using sound.

00:04:35.892 --> 00:04:36.929
(Applause)

00:04:36.953 --> 00:04:38.655
Listening to this gamma-ray burst

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:40.999
that you're seeing on the --
(Applause continues)

00:04:41.023 --> 00:04:42.174
Thank you.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.906
Listening to this burst
that you're seeing on the screen

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.525
brought something to the ear
beyond the obvious burst.

00:04:47.973 --> 00:04:49.908
Now I'm going to play the burst for you.

00:04:49.932 --> 00:04:51.986
It's not music, it's sound.

00:04:53.264 --> 00:04:56.515
(Digital beeping sounds)

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.830
This is scientific data
converted into sound,

00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:01.088
and it's mapped in pitch.

00:05:01.112 --> 00:05:03.531
The process is called sonification.

00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.268
So listening to this
brought something to the ear

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:10.641
besides the obvious burst.

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:15.186
When I examine the very strong
low-frequency regions,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.082
or bass line -- I'm zooming
into the bass line now.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.019
We noted resonances characteristic
of electrically charged gasses

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:28.645
like the solar wind.

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.172
And I want you to hear what I heard.

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:34.977
You will hear it as a very fast
decrease in volume.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.764
And because you're sighted,
I'm giving you a red line

00:05:37.788 --> 00:05:41.727
indicating what intensity of light
is being converted into sound.

00:05:43.672 --> 00:05:46.086
(Digital hum and whistling sound)

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.404
The (Whistles) is frogs at home,
don't pay attention to that.

00:05:49.428 --> 00:05:51.274
(Laughter)

00:05:51.298 --> 00:05:56.525
(Digital hum and whistling sound)

00:05:56.549 --> 00:05:58.421
I think you heard it, right?

00:05:59.503 --> 00:06:00.780
So what we found

00:06:00.804 --> 00:06:05.718
is that the bursts last long enough
in order to support wave resonances,

00:06:05.742 --> 00:06:09.959
which are things caused by exchanges
of energy between particles

00:06:09.983 --> 00:06:11.301
that may have been excited,

00:06:11.325 --> 00:06:12.706
that depend on the volume.

00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:16.241
You may remember that I said
that the matter around the star

00:06:16.265 --> 00:06:17.921
is dragged around?

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:21.759
It transmits power with frequency
and field distribution

00:06:21.783 --> 00:06:23.505
determined by the dimensions.

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:28.384
You may remember that we were talking
about a super-massive star

00:06:28.408 --> 00:06:31.576
that became a very strong
magnetic field magnetar.

00:06:32.264 --> 00:06:36.637
If this is the case, then outflows
from the exploding star

00:06:36.661 --> 00:06:39.144
may be associated
with this gamma-ray burst.

00:06:39.168 --> 00:06:40.736
What does that mean?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.727
That star formation
may be a very important part

00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:45.265
of these supernova explosions.

00:06:46.047 --> 00:06:50.434
Listening to this very gamma-ray burst
brought us to the notion

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:53.257
that the use of sound
as an adjunctive visual display

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:55.506
may also support sighted astronomers

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.980
in the search for more
information in the data.

00:06:58.562 --> 00:07:03.880
Simultaneously, I worked on analyzing
measurements from other telescopes,

00:07:03.904 --> 00:07:06.107
and my experiments demonstrated

00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:10.345
that when you use sound
as an adjunctive visual display,

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:13.285
astronomers can find more information

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:16.176
in this now more accessible data set.

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:20.830
This ability to transform data into sound

00:07:20.854 --> 00:07:23.931
gives astronomy a tremendous
power of transformation.

00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:28.322
And the fact that a field
that is so visual may be improved

00:07:28.346 --> 00:07:33.019
in order to include anyone with interest
in understanding what lies in the heavens

00:07:33.043 --> 00:07:34.552
is a spirit-lifter.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.279
When I lost my sight,

00:07:37.303 --> 00:07:39.379
I noticed that I didn't have access

00:07:39.403 --> 00:07:42.029
to the same amount
and quality of information

00:07:42.053 --> 00:07:43.449
a sighted astronomer had.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.700
It was not until we innovated
with the sonification process

00:07:47.724 --> 00:07:51.676
that I regained the hope
to be a productive member of the field

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.310
that I had worked so hard to be part of.

00:07:55.429 --> 00:07:59.880
Yet, information access
is not the only area in astronomy

00:07:59.904 --> 00:08:02.088
where this is important.

00:08:02.602 --> 00:08:05.126
The situation is systemic

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.119
and scientific fields are not keeping up.

00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:11.477
The body is something changeable --

00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:14.866
anyone may develop
a disability at any point.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.128
Let's think about, for example,

00:08:17.152 --> 00:08:19.939
scientists that are already
at the top of their careers.

00:08:19.963 --> 00:08:22.803
What happens to them
if they develop a disability?

00:08:22.827 --> 00:08:25.244
Will they feel excommunicated as I did?

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:29.029
Information access
empowers us to flourish.

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:33.099
It gives us equal opportunities
to display our talents

00:08:33.123 --> 00:08:35.986
and choose what we want
to do with our lives,

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.318
based on interest and not based
on potential barriers.

00:08:40.294 --> 00:08:44.661
When we give people the opportunity
to succeed without limits,

00:08:44.685 --> 00:08:49.243
that will lead to personal fulfillment
and prospering life.

00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:51.700
And I think that the use
of sound in astronomy

00:08:51.724 --> 00:08:55.201
is helping us to achieve that
and to contribute to science.

00:08:56.119 --> 00:09:00.651
While other countries told me
that the study of perception techniques

00:09:00.675 --> 00:09:04.252
in order to study astronomy data
is not relevant to astronomy

00:09:04.276 --> 00:09:07.476
because there are no blind
astronomers in the field,

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.904
South Africa said, "We want
people with disabilities

00:09:10.928 --> 00:09:12.904
to contribute to the field."

00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:14.254
Right now, I'm working

00:09:14.278 --> 00:09:17.010
at the South African
Astronomical Observatory,

00:09:17.034 --> 00:09:20.119
at the Office of Astronomy
for Development.

00:09:20.436 --> 00:09:25.177
There, we are working on sonification
techniques and analysis methods

00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:28.647
to impact the students
of the Athlone School for the Blind.

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:32.089
These students will be learning
radio astronomy,

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:35.351
and they will be learning
the sonification methods

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:39.846
in order to study astronomical events
like huge ejections of energy

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.306
from the sun, known as
coronal mass ejections.

00:09:43.194 --> 00:09:44.953
What we learn with these students --

00:09:44.977 --> 00:09:48.774
these students have multiple disabilities
and coping strategies

00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:50.674
that will be accommodated --

00:09:50.698 --> 00:09:53.537
what we learn with these students
will directly impact

00:09:53.561 --> 00:09:56.718
the way things are being done
at the professional level.

00:09:56.742 --> 00:09:58.801
I humbly call this development.

00:09:58.825 --> 00:10:01.081
And this is happening right now.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.728
I think that science is for everyone.

00:10:06.275 --> 00:10:07.723
It belongs to the people,

00:10:07.747 --> 00:10:09.998
and it has to be available to everyone,

00:10:10.022 --> 00:10:12.235
because we are all natural explorers.

00:10:12.956 --> 00:10:18.136
I think that if we limit people
with disabilities

00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:20.000
from participating in science,

00:10:20.024 --> 00:10:23.672
we'll sever our links with history
and with society.

00:10:23.696 --> 00:10:27.142
I dream of a level
scientific playing field,

00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:32.154
where people encourage respect
and respect each other,

00:10:32.178 --> 00:10:35.266
where people exchange strategies
and discover together.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.107
If people with disabilities
are allowed into the scientific field,

00:10:40.131 --> 00:10:44.840
an explosion, a huge titanic burst
of knowledge will take place,

00:10:44.864 --> 00:10:46.341
I am sure.

00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:51.100
(Digital beeping sounds)

00:10:51.124 --> 00:10:52.988
That is the titanic burst.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.571
Thank you.

00:10:55.595 --> 00:10:56.746
Thank you.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:02.442
(Applause)
