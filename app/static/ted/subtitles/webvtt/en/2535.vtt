00:00:00.965 --> 00:00:03.507
I could never have imagined

00:00:03.531 --> 00:00:07.483
that a 19-year-old suicide bomber

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:11.188
would actually teach me a valuable lesson.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.807
But he did.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.259
He taught me to never presume anything

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:22.423
about anyone you don't know.

00:00:24.414 --> 00:00:28.543
On a Thursday morning in July 2005,

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:31.625
the bomber and I, unknowingly,

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.196
boarded the same train carriage
at the same time,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.683
standing, apparently, just feet apart.

00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:43.495
I didn't see him.

00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:45.976
Actually, I didn't see anyone.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.587
You know not to look
at anyone on the Tube,

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:51.912
but I guess he saw me.

00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:55.957
I guess he looked at all of us,

00:00:56.687 --> 00:01:00.901
as his hand hovered
over the detonation switch.

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:06.884
I've often wondered: What was he thinking?

00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:10.265
Especially in those final seconds.

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:14.374
I know it wasn't personal.

00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:18.994
He didn't set out to kill
or maim me, Gill Hicks.

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:20.771
I mean -- he didn't know me.

00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:22.932
No.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.612
Instead, he gave me

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:31.241
an unwarranted and an unwanted label.

00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:35.652
I had become the enemy.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.966
To him, I was the "other,"

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.687
the "them," as opposed to "us."

00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:50.855
The label "enemy" allowed him
to dehumanize us.

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:54.101
It allowed him to push that button.

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:57.506
And he wasn't selective.

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:04.058
Twenty-six precious lives were taken
in my carriage alone,

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:06.970
and I was almost one of them.

00:02:08.855 --> 00:02:11.596
In the time it takes to draw a breath,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.290
we were plunged into a darkness so immense

00:02:15.314 --> 00:02:17.696
that it was almost tangible;

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.079
what I imagine wading
through tar might be like.

00:02:23.398 --> 00:02:25.448
We didn't know we were the enemy.

00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:30.379
We were just a bunch of commuters
who, minutes earlier,

00:02:30.403 --> 00:02:32.887
had followed the Tube etiquette:

00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:35.117
no direct eye contact,

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:36.291
no talking

00:02:36.894 --> 00:02:39.766
and absolutely no conversation.

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:44.901
But in the lifting of the darkness,

00:02:45.776 --> 00:02:47.401
we were reaching out.

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:49.691
We were helping each other.

00:02:50.808 --> 00:02:53.269
We were calling out our names,

00:02:53.293 --> 00:02:55.444
a little bit like a roll call,

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.666
waiting for responses.

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.222
"I'm Gill. I'm here.

00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:06.421
I'm alive.

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:09.468
OK."

00:03:11.697 --> 00:03:12.883
"I'm Gill.

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:14.875
Here.

00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:17.627
Alive.

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.524
OK."

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:25.637
I didn't know Alison.

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:30.641
But I listened for her check-ins
every few minutes.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.958
I didn't know Richard.

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.728
But it mattered to me that he survived.

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:40.546
All I shared with them

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.053
was my first name.

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:44.164
They didn't know

00:03:44.188 --> 00:03:47.711
that I was a head of a department
at the Design Council.

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:52.742
And here is my beloved briefcase,

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:55.217
also rescued from that morning.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.445
They didn't know that I published
architecture and design journals,

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.785
that I was a Fellow
of the Royal Society of Arts,

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.274
that I wore black --

00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:07.861
still do --

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:11.122
that I smoked cigarillos.

00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:14.191
I don't smoke cigarillos anymore.

00:04:14.215 --> 00:04:18.399
I drank gin and I watched TED Talks,

00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:24.629
of course, never dreaming
that one day I would be standing,

00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:28.488
balancing on prosthetic legs,

00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:29.669
giving a talk.

00:04:30.651 --> 00:04:36.295
I was a young Australian woman
doing extraordinary things in London.

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.152
And I wasn't ready for that all to end.

00:04:40.882 --> 00:04:44.040
I was so determined to survive

00:04:44.064 --> 00:04:49.266
that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets
around the tops of my legs,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.623
and I just shut everything
and everyone out,

00:04:55.345 --> 00:04:58.605
to focus, to listen to myself,

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.763
to be guided by instinct alone.

00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:05.179
I lowered my breathing rate.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.627
I elevated my thighs.

00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:09.319
I held myself upright

00:05:09.343 --> 00:05:13.013
and I fought the urge to close my eyes.

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:18.013
I held on for almost an hour,

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.411
an hour to contemplate
the whole of my life

00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:25.231
up until this point.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.278
Perhaps I should have done more.

00:05:31.223 --> 00:05:34.427
Perhaps I could have
lived more, seen more.

00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:38.865
Maybe I should have gone running,
dancing, taken up yoga.

00:05:40.317 --> 00:05:45.255
But my priority and my focus
was always my work.

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.180
I lived to work.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.537
Who I was on my business card

00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:51.831
mattered to me.

00:05:53.688 --> 00:05:57.298
But it didn't matter down in that tunnel.

00:05:59.226 --> 00:06:03.696
By the time I felt that first touch

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.860
from one of my rescuers,

00:06:06.472 --> 00:06:08.589
I was unable to speak,

00:06:08.613 --> 00:06:13.592
unable to say even
a small word, like "Gill."

00:06:15.183 --> 00:06:17.918
I surrendered my body to them.

00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:20.815
I had done all I possibly could,

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.535
and now I was in their hands.

00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:28.479
I understood

00:06:29.283 --> 00:06:35.481
just who and what humanity really is,

00:06:35.972 --> 00:06:39.171
when I first saw the ID tag

00:06:39.195 --> 00:06:42.454
that was given to me
when I was admitted to hospital.

00:06:42.478 --> 00:06:43.652
And it read:

00:06:44.218 --> 00:06:49.488
"One unknown estimated female."

00:06:51.162 --> 00:06:55.377
One unknown estimated female.

00:06:57.004 --> 00:06:59.951
Those four words were my gift.

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:03.872
What they told me very clearly

00:07:03.896 --> 00:07:06.601
was that my life was saved,

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.769
purely because I was a human being.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.794
Difference of any kind made no difference

00:07:14.818 --> 00:07:19.375
to the extraordinary lengths
that the rescuers were prepared to go

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.669
to save my life,

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:25.181
to save as many unknowns as they could,

00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:27.537
and putting their own lives at risk.

00:07:28.405 --> 00:07:32.576
To them, it didn't matter
if I was rich or poor,

00:07:33.298 --> 00:07:35.439
the color of my skin,

00:07:35.463 --> 00:07:37.025
whether I was male or female,

00:07:37.049 --> 00:07:38.946
my sexual orientation,

00:07:39.613 --> 00:07:41.216
who I voted for,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.758
whether I was educated,

00:07:42.782 --> 00:07:46.471
if I had a faith or no faith at all.

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:49.353
Nothing mattered

00:07:49.377 --> 00:07:54.020
other than I was a precious human life.

00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:59.361
I see myself as a living fact.

00:08:00.223 --> 00:08:02.252
I am proof

00:08:02.276 --> 00:08:09.004
that unconditional love and respect
can not only save,

00:08:09.028 --> 00:08:12.069
but it can transform lives.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:17.694
Here is a wonderful image
of one of my rescuers, Andy, and I

00:08:17.718 --> 00:08:19.590
taken just last year.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.641
Ten years after the event,

00:08:22.665 --> 00:08:25.009
and here we are, arm in arm.

00:08:27.559 --> 00:08:29.677
Throughout all the chaos,

00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:32.541
my hand was held tightly.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.073
My face was stroked gently.

00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:38.573
What did I feel?

00:08:39.541 --> 00:08:40.763
I felt loved.

00:08:41.685 --> 00:08:46.502
What's shielded me from hatred
and wanting retribution,

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.515
what's given me the courage to say:

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:52.419
this ends with me

00:08:54.006 --> 00:08:55.197
is love.

00:08:56.585 --> 00:08:58.583
I was loved.

00:09:01.234 --> 00:09:07.499
I believe the potential
for widespread positive change

00:09:07.523 --> 00:09:09.103
is absolutely enormous

00:09:09.127 --> 00:09:12.031
because I know what we're capable of.

00:09:12.055 --> 00:09:15.252
I know the brilliance of humanity.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.840
So this leaves me with some
pretty big things to ponder

00:09:19.864 --> 00:09:23.266
and some questions for us all to consider:

00:09:24.512 --> 00:09:30.385
Is what unites us not far greater
than what can ever divide?

00:09:31.663 --> 00:09:35.453
Does it have to take
a tragedy or a disaster

00:09:35.477 --> 00:09:39.973
for us to feel deeply
connected as one species,

00:09:40.902 --> 00:09:42.761
as human beings?

00:09:43.755 --> 00:09:48.961
And when will we embrace
the wisdom of our era

00:09:49.764 --> 00:09:53.134
to rise above mere tolerance

00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:56.868
and move to an acceptance

00:09:56.892 --> 00:10:02.225
for all who are only a label
until we know them?

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.710
Thank you.

00:10:04.734 --> 00:10:11.532
(Applause)
