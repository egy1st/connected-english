00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:02.604
Ichthyology,

00:00:02.628 --> 00:00:04.088
the study of fishes.

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:06.970
It looks like a big, boring word,

00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:09.175
but it's actually quite exciting,

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.172
because ichthyology is the only "ology"

00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:13.527
with "YOLO" in it.

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:15.335
(Laughter)

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.185
Now, to the cool kids in the audience,

00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:21.386
you already know, YOLO stands for
"you only live once,"

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.072
and because I only have one life,

00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:25.859
I'm going to spend it doing
what I always dreamt of doing:

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:29.043
seeing the hidden wonders of the world
and discovering new species.

00:00:29.068 --> 00:00:30.566
And that's what I get to do.

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:35.328
Now, in recent years, I really focused
on caves for finding new species.

00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:38.618
And it turns out, there's lots of new
cavefish species out there.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.425
You just have to know where to look,

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.658
and to maybe be a little thin.

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:43.776
(Laughter)

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.825
Now, cavefishes can tell me
a lot about biology and geology.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:52.197
They can tell me how the landmasses
around them have changed and moved

00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:54.439
by being stuck in these little holes,

00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:58.026
and they can tell me about
the evolution of sight, by being blind.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:02.470
Now, fish have eyes
that are essentially the same as ours.

00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:06.322
All vertebrates do, and each time
a fish species starts to adapt

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:08.758
to this dark, cold, cave environment,

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:12.719
over many, many generations,
they lose their eyes and their eyesight

00:01:12.743 --> 00:01:15.893
until the end up like an eyeless
cavefish like this one here.

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:19.754
Now, each cavefish species
has evolved in a slightly different way,

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:23.850
and each one has a unique geological
and biological story to tell us,

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:26.801
and that's why it's so exciting
when we find a new species.

00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:30.654
So this is a new species
we described, from southern Indiana.

00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:34.972
We named it Amblyopsis hoosieri,
the Hoosier cavefish.

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:36.057
(Laughter)

00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:39.010
Its closest relatives
are cavefishes in Kentucky,

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:40.636
in the Mammoth Cave system.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.693
And they start to diverge
when the Ohio River split them

00:01:43.717 --> 00:01:45.002
a few million years ago.

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:48.162
And in that time they developed
these subtle differences

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:50.947
in the genetic architecture
behind their blindness.

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.805
There's this gene called rhodopsin
that's super-critical for sight.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.226
We have it, and these species have it too,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.123
except one species has lost
all function in that gene,

00:02:00.147 --> 00:02:01.821
and the other one maintains it.

00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:06.257
So this sets up this beautiful
natural experiment

00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:09.245
where we can look at the genes
behind our vision,

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.928
and at the very roots of how we can see.

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:14.761
But the genes in these cavefishes

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:17.571
can also tell us
about deep geological time,

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:20.055
maybe no more so
than in this species here.

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.896
This is a new species
we described from Madagascar

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.221
that we named Typhleotris mararybe.

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.510
That means "big sickness" in Malagasy,

00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:32.083
for how sick we got trying
to collect this species.

00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:34.192
Now, believe it or not,

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:36.806
swimming around sinkholes
full of dead things

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.713
and cave full of bat poop

00:02:38.737 --> 00:02:41.546
isn't the smartest thing you could
be doing with your life,

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.079
but YOLO.

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:46.898
(Laughter)

00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:51.096
Now, I love this species despite the fact
that it tried to kill us,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.915
and that's because
this species in Madagascar,

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.763
its closest relatives
are 6,000 kilometers away,

00:02:56.787 --> 00:02:58.151
cavefishes in Australia.

00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:02.336
Now, there's no way a three-inch-long
freshwater cavefish

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.399
can swim across the Indian Ocean,

00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:07.254
so what we found when we compared
the DNA of these species

00:03:07.278 --> 00:03:10.575
is that they've been separated
for more than 100 million years,

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.938
or about the time that the southern
continents were last together.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.081
So in fact, these species
didn't move at all.

00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:19.906
It's the continents that moved them.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.953
And so they give us, through their DNA,

00:03:21.977 --> 00:03:24.398
this precise model and measure

00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:27.580
of how to date and time
these ancient geological events.

00:03:29.064 --> 00:03:31.296
Now, this species here is so new

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.803
I'm not even allowed
to tell you its name yet,

00:03:33.827 --> 00:03:36.489
but I can tell you
it's a new species from Mexico,

00:03:36.513 --> 00:03:38.264
and it's probably already extinct.

00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:42.014
It's probably extinct because
the only known cave system it's from

00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:44.690
was destroyed when a dam was built nearby.

00:03:44.714 --> 00:03:46.676
Unfortunately for cavefishes,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.280
their groundwater habitat

00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:50.500
is also our main source of drinking water.

00:03:51.103 --> 00:03:55.801
Now, we actually don't know
this species' closest relative, yet.

00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:58.475
It doesn't appear to be
anything else in Mexico,

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:00.199
so maybe it's something in Cuba,

00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:02.245
or Florida, or India.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.335
But whatever it is, it might tell us
something new about the geology

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.567
of the Caribbean, or the biology
of how to better diagnose

00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:12.712
certain types of blindness.

00:04:12.736 --> 00:04:16.146
But I hope we discover this species
before it goes extinct too.

00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:18.648
And I'm going to spend my one life

00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:22.201
as an ichthyologist
trying to discover and save

00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:24.803
these humble little blind cavefishes

00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:28.293
that can tell us so much
about the geology of the planet

00:04:28.317 --> 00:04:30.133
and the biology of how we see.

00:04:30.672 --> 00:04:31.823
Thank you.

00:04:31.847 --> 00:04:36.206
(Applause)
