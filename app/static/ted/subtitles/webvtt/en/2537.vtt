00:00:00.826 --> 00:00:03.469
So I'd like you to imagine for a moment

00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:05.873
that you're a soldier
in the heat of battle.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.261
Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier
or a medieval archer

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:12.165
or maybe you're a Zulu warrior.

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.443
Regardless of your time and place,
there are some things that are constant.

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.361
Your adrenaline is elevated,

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:23.194
and your actions are stemming
from these deeply ingrained reflexes,

00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:27.574
reflexes rooted in a need
to protect yourself and your side

00:00:27.598 --> 00:00:29.287
and to defeat the enemy.

00:00:30.826 --> 00:00:34.363
So now, I'd like you to imagine
playing a very different role,

00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:35.988
that of the scout.

00:00:36.012 --> 00:00:39.401
The scout's job is not
to attack or defend.

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:41.820
The scout's job is to understand.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.294
The scout is the one going out,

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:48.381
mapping the terrain,
identifying potential obstacles.

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:51.981
And the scout may hope to learn
that, say, there's a bridge

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.339
in a convenient location across a river.

00:00:54.363 --> 00:00:57.410
But above all, the scout
wants to know what's really there,

00:00:57.434 --> 00:00:59.027
as accurately as possible.

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:05.241
And in a real, actual army, both
the soldier and the scout are essential.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:10.575
But you can also think of each
of these roles as a mindset --

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:14.226
a metaphor for how all of us
process information and ideas

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.717
in our daily lives.

00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:20.022
What I'm going to argue today
is that having good judgment,

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.260
making accurate predictions,
making good decisions,

00:01:23.284 --> 00:01:26.042
is mostly about which mindset you're in.

00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:29.587
To illustrate these mindsets in action,

00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:33.095
I'm going to take you back
to 19th-century France,

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.102
where this innocuous-looking
piece of paper

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:39.164
launched one of the biggest
political scandals in history.

00:01:39.718 --> 00:01:44.115
It was discovered in 1894
by officers in the French general staff.

00:01:44.616 --> 00:01:47.308
It was torn up in a wastepaper basket,

00:01:47.332 --> 00:01:49.257
but when they pieced it back together,

00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:51.313
they discovered
that someone in their ranks

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:53.700
had been selling
military secrets to Germany.

00:01:54.462 --> 00:01:56.819
So they launched a big investigation,

00:01:56.843 --> 00:02:00.709
and their suspicions
quickly converged on this man,

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:02.065
Alfred Dreyfus.

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:04.185
He had a sterling record,

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.729
no past history of wrongdoing,
no motive as far as they could tell.

00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:13.460
But Dreyfus was the only
Jewish officer at that rank in the army,

00:02:13.484 --> 00:02:17.659
and unfortunately at this time,
the French Army was highly anti-Semitic.

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:20.905
They compared Dreyfus's handwriting
to that on the memo

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:22.866
and concluded that it was a match,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.932
even though outside
professional handwriting experts

00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:28.106
were much less confident
in the similarity,

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.520
but never mind that.

00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:31.584
They went and searched
Dreyfus's apartment,

00:02:31.608 --> 00:02:33.364
looking for any signs of espionage.

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:36.348
They went through his files,
and they didn't find anything.

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:39.506
This just convinced them more
that Dreyfus was not only guilty,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.823
but sneaky as well, because clearly
he had hidden all of the evidence

00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:44.696
before they had managed to get to it.

00:02:45.212 --> 00:02:47.904
Next, they went and looked
through his personal history

00:02:47.928 --> 00:02:50.229
for any incriminating details.

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:51.855
They talked to his teachers,

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.664
they found that he had studied
foreign languages in school,

00:02:54.688 --> 00:02:58.741
which clearly showed a desire
to conspire with foreign governments

00:02:58.765 --> 00:02:59.948
later in life.

00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:05.983
His teachers also said that Dreyfus
was known for having a good memory,

00:03:06.007 --> 00:03:08.119
which was highly suspicious, right?

00:03:08.143 --> 00:03:11.483
You know, because a spy
has to remember a lot of things.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.099
So the case went to trial,
and Dreyfus was found guilty.

00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:20.136
Afterwards, they took him out
into this public square

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.884
and ritualistically tore
his insignia from his uniform

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:25.813
and broke his sword in two.

00:03:25.837 --> 00:03:27.852
This was called
the Degradation of Dreyfus.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.377
And they sentenced him
to life imprisonment

00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:34.141
on the aptly named Devil's Island,

00:03:34.165 --> 00:03:36.989
which is this barren rock
off the coast of South America.

00:03:37.556 --> 00:03:41.306
So there he went,
and there he spent his days alone,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.834
writing letters and letters
to the French government

00:03:43.858 --> 00:03:47.166
begging them to reopen his case
so they could discover his innocence.

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:50.547
But for the most part,
France considered the matter closed.

00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:55.594
One thing that's really interesting
to me about the Dreyfus Affair

00:03:55.618 --> 00:03:59.396
is this question of why the officers
were so convinced

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.141
that Dreyfus was guilty.

00:04:01.556 --> 00:04:04.403
I mean, you might even assume
that they were setting him up,

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:06.395
that they were intentionally framing him.

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.686
But historians don't think
that's what happened.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.869
As far as we can tell,

00:04:09.893 --> 00:04:14.130
the officers genuinely believed
that the case against Dreyfus was strong.

00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:16.630
Which makes you wonder:

00:04:16.654 --> 00:04:18.928
What does it say about the human mind

00:04:18.952 --> 00:04:21.265
that we can find such paltry evidence

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.376
to be compelling enough to convict a man?

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.496
Well, this is a case of what scientists
call "motivated reasoning."

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.574
It's this phenomenon in which
our unconscious motivations,

00:04:31.598 --> 00:04:33.950
our desires and fears,

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:36.320
shape the way we interpret information.

00:04:36.344 --> 00:04:39.754
Some information, some ideas,
feel like our allies.

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:42.420
We want them to win.
We want to defend them.

00:04:42.444 --> 00:04:44.975
And other information
or ideas are the enemy,

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:46.567
and we want to shoot them down.

00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:51.115
So this is why I call
motivated reasoning, "soldier mindset."

00:04:51.988 --> 00:04:54.993
Probably most of you have never persecuted

00:04:55.017 --> 00:04:57.298
a French-Jewish officer for high treason,

00:04:57.322 --> 00:04:58.795
I assume,

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.678
but maybe you've followed sports
or politics, so you might have noticed

00:05:03.702 --> 00:05:07.824
that when the referee judges
that your team committed a foul,

00:05:07.848 --> 00:05:09.010
for example,

00:05:09.034 --> 00:05:12.127
you're highly motivated
to find reasons why he's wrong.

00:05:12.482 --> 00:05:15.594
But if he judges that the other team
committed a foul -- awesome!

00:05:15.618 --> 00:05:18.180
That's a good call,
let's not examine it too closely.

00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:20.909
Or, maybe you've read
an article or a study

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:23.639
that examined some controversial policy,

00:05:23.663 --> 00:05:24.879
like capital punishment.

00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:27.852
And, as researchers have demonstrated,

00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:29.581
if you support capital punishment

00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:32.121
and the study shows
that it's not effective,

00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:35.391
then you're highly motivated
to find all the reasons

00:05:35.415 --> 00:05:37.588
why the study was poorly designed.

00:05:37.612 --> 00:05:39.818
But if it shows
that capital punishment works,

00:05:39.842 --> 00:05:41.001
it's a good study.

00:05:41.025 --> 00:05:44.273
And vice versa: if you don't
support capital punishment, same thing.

00:05:44.297 --> 00:05:47.126
Our judgment is strongly
influenced, unconsciously,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.428
by which side we want to win.

00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:51.960
And this is ubiquitous.

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:55.022
This shapes how we think
about our health, our relationships,

00:05:55.046 --> 00:05:56.942
how we decide how to vote,

00:05:56.966 --> 00:05:59.334
what we consider fair or ethical.

00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:02.799
What's most scary to me
about motivated reasoning

00:06:02.823 --> 00:06:03.974
or soldier mindset,

00:06:03.998 --> 00:06:05.245
is how unconscious it is.

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:08.549
We can think we're being
objective and fair-minded

00:06:08.573 --> 00:06:12.040
and still wind up ruining the life
of an innocent man.

00:06:13.008 --> 00:06:15.891
However, fortunately for Dreyfus,
his story is not over.

00:06:15.915 --> 00:06:17.283
This is Colonel Picquart.

00:06:17.307 --> 00:06:19.851
He's another high-ranking officer
in the French Army,

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:22.504
and like most people,
he assumed Dreyfus was guilty.

00:06:22.893 --> 00:06:27.318
Also like most people in the army,
he was at least casually anti-Semitic.

00:06:27.342 --> 00:06:30.707
But at a certain point,
Picquart began to suspect:

00:06:31.302 --> 00:06:34.077
"What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?"

00:06:34.448 --> 00:06:36.626
What happened was,
he had discovered evidence

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.127
that the spying for Germany had continued,

00:06:39.151 --> 00:06:41.126
even after Dreyfus was in prison.

00:06:41.516 --> 00:06:44.812
And he had also discovered
that another officer in the army

00:06:44.836 --> 00:06:47.409
had handwriting that perfectly
matched the memo,

00:06:47.433 --> 00:06:49.794
much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting.

00:06:50.382 --> 00:06:53.223
So he brought these discoveries
to his superiors,

00:06:54.017 --> 00:06:57.694
but to his dismay,
they either didn't care

00:06:57.718 --> 00:07:01.306
or came up with elaborate rationalizations
to explain his findings,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.703
like, "Well, all you've really shown,
Picquart, is that there's another spy

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:09.100
who learned how to mimic
Dreyfus's handwriting,

00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:12.664
and he picked up the torch of spying
after Dreyfus left.

00:07:13.148 --> 00:07:14.798
But Dreyfus is still guilty."

00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:18.879
Eventually, Picquart managed
to get Dreyfus exonerated.

00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:20.431
But it took him 10 years,

00:07:20.455 --> 00:07:22.986
and for part of that time,
he himself was in prison

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.308
for the crime of disloyalty to the army.

00:07:26.491 --> 00:07:32.491
A lot of people feel like Picquart
can't really be the hero of this story

00:07:32.515 --> 00:07:36.744
because he was an anti-Semite
and that's bad, which I agree with.

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:41.974
But personally, for me,
the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic

00:07:41.998 --> 00:07:44.583
actually makes his actions more admirable,

00:07:44.607 --> 00:07:47.723
because he had the same prejudices,
the same reasons to be biased

00:07:47.747 --> 00:07:49.532
as his fellow officers,

00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:54.191
but his motivation to find the truth
and uphold it trumped all of that.

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:56.297
So to me,

00:07:56.321 --> 00:08:00.127
Picquart is a poster child
for what I call "scout mindset."

00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:04.674
It's the drive not to make
one idea win or another lose,

00:08:04.698 --> 00:08:06.622
but just to see what's really there

00:08:06.646 --> 00:08:09.121
as honestly and accurately as you can,

00:08:09.145 --> 00:08:12.425
even if it's not pretty
or convenient or pleasant.

00:08:13.444 --> 00:08:16.690
This mindset is what
I'm personally passionate about.

00:08:16.714 --> 00:08:21.843
And I've spent the last few years
examining and trying to figure out

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:23.850
what causes scout mindset.

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:27.022
Why are some people, sometimes at least,

00:08:27.046 --> 00:08:30.834
able to cut through their own prejudices
and biases and motivations

00:08:30.858 --> 00:08:33.153
and just try to see the facts
and the evidence

00:08:33.177 --> 00:08:34.650
as objectively as they can?

00:08:35.602 --> 00:08:38.613
And the answer is emotional.

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:42.886
So, just as soldier mindset
is rooted in emotions

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.898
like defensiveness or tribalism,

00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:47.981
scout mindset is, too.

00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:49.991
It's just rooted in different emotions.

00:08:50.015 --> 00:08:53.434
For example, scouts are curious.

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:57.004
They're more likely to say
they feel pleasure

00:08:57.028 --> 00:08:58.688
when they learn new information

00:08:58.712 --> 00:09:01.023
or an itch to solve a puzzle.

00:09:01.544 --> 00:09:04.713
They're more likely to feel intrigued
when they encounter something

00:09:04.737 --> 00:09:06.833
that contradicts their expectations.

00:09:07.206 --> 00:09:09.183
Scouts also have different values.

00:09:09.207 --> 00:09:12.279
They're more likely to say
they think it's virtuous

00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:13.792
to test your own beliefs,

00:09:13.816 --> 00:09:17.522
and they're less likely to say
that someone who changes his mind

00:09:17.546 --> 00:09:18.808
seems weak.

00:09:18.832 --> 00:09:20.717
And above all, scouts are grounded,

00:09:20.741 --> 00:09:24.646
which means their self-worth as a person

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:30.136
isn't tied to how right or wrong
they are about any particular topic.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.414
So they can believe
that capital punishment works.

00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:36.251
If studies come out showing
that it doesn't, they can say,

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:40.184
"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong.
Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid."

00:09:41.954 --> 00:09:46.280
This cluster of traits
is what researchers have found --

00:09:46.304 --> 00:09:48.010
and I've also found anecdotally --

00:09:48.034 --> 00:09:49.865
predicts good judgment.

00:09:50.386 --> 00:09:53.669
And the key takeaway I want
to leave you with about those traits

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:57.330
is that they're primarily
not about how smart you are

00:09:57.354 --> 00:09:59.352
or about how much you know.

00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:02.182
In fact, they don't correlate
very much with IQ at all.

00:10:02.638 --> 00:10:04.288
They're about how you feel.

00:10:04.849 --> 00:10:08.872
There's a quote that I keep
coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.

00:10:08.896 --> 00:10:10.837
He's the author of "The Little Prince."

00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.630
He said, "If you want to build a ship,

00:10:14.234 --> 00:10:18.855
don't drum up your men
to collect wood and give orders

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:20.299
and distribute the work.

00:10:20.669 --> 00:10:25.236
Instead, teach them to yearn
for the vast and endless sea."

00:10:26.252 --> 00:10:28.398
In other words, I claim,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.010
if we really want to improve
our judgment as individuals

00:10:32.034 --> 00:10:33.477
and as societies,

00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:37.010
what we need most
is not more instruction in logic

00:10:37.034 --> 00:10:40.582
or rhetoric or probability or economics,

00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:42.689
even though those things
are quite valuable.

00:10:42.713 --> 00:10:46.017
But what we most need
to use those principles well

00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:47.459
is scout mindset.

00:10:47.483 --> 00:10:49.363
We need to change the way we feel.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:53.569
We need to learn how to feel proud
instead of ashamed

00:10:53.593 --> 00:10:56.231
when we notice we might
have been wrong about something.

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:59.383
We need to learn how to feel intrigued
instead of defensive

00:10:59.407 --> 00:11:03.650
when we encounter some information
that contradicts our beliefs.

00:11:04.555 --> 00:11:07.415
So the question I want
to leave you with is:

00:11:07.817 --> 00:11:09.967
What do you most yearn for?

00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:13.398
Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs?

00:11:14.128 --> 00:11:17.722
Or do you yearn to see the world
as clearly as you possibly can?

00:11:18.352 --> 00:11:19.503
Thank you.

00:11:19.527 --> 00:11:24.524
(Applause)
