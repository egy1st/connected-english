00:00:00.985 --> 00:00:03.768
At Free America, we've done
a listening and learning tour.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.834
We visited not only with prosecutors

00:00:07.858 --> 00:00:09.604
but with legislators,

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:14.489
with inmates in our state
and local prisons.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.932
We've gone to immigration
detention centers.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:19.675
We've met a lot of people.

00:00:21.174 --> 00:00:27.398
And we've seen that redemption
and transformation can happen

00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:32.109
in our prisons, our jails
and our immigration detention centers,

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.150
giving hope to those
who want to create a better life

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:36.842
after serving their time.

00:00:38.028 --> 00:00:41.596
Imagine if we also considered
the front end of this prison pipeline.

00:00:41.964 --> 00:00:43.905
What would it look like
if we intervened,

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.882
with rehabilitation as a core value --

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:49.940
with love and compassion as core values?

00:00:50.523 --> 00:00:52.822
We would have a society that is safer,

00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:53.997
healthier

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:55.870
and worthy of raising our children in.

00:00:56.864 --> 00:00:59.536
I want to introduce you to James Cavitt.

00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:04.539
James served 12 years
in the San Quentin State Prison

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:07.213
and is being released in 18 months.

00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:09.774
Now James, like you and me,

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:12.714
is more than the worst thing he's done.

00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:16.608
He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet.

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:18.882
He committed a crime;

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:20.523
he's paying his debt,

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.011
and working hard to build the skills

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:26.122
to make the transition back
to a productive life

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:29.783
when he enters the civilian
population again.

00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:32.461
Now James, like millions
of people behind bars,

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:34.520
is an example of what happens

00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:38.995
if we believe that our failings
don't define who we are,

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:41.321
that we are all worthy of redemption

00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:45.582
and if we support those impacted
by mass incarceration,

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.233
we can all heal together.

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:50.320
I'd like to introduce you
to James right now,

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.828
and he's going to share
his journey of redemption

00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:54.002
through spoken word.

00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:57.782
James Cavitt: Thanks, John.

00:01:57.806 --> 00:01:59.721
TED, welcome to San Quentin.

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:03.195
The talent is abundant
behind prison walls.

00:02:03.608 --> 00:02:05.640
Future software engineers,

00:02:05.664 --> 00:02:06.943
entrepreneurs,

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:08.118
craftsmen,

00:02:08.142 --> 00:02:09.293
musicians

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:10.600
and artists.

00:02:10.624 --> 00:02:13.721
This piece is inspired
by all of the hard work

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:16.973
that men and women are doing on the inside

00:02:16.997 --> 00:02:20.322
to create better lives
and futures for themselves

00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:22.179
after they serve their time.

00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:26.518
This piece is entitled, "Where I Live."

00:02:28.218 --> 00:02:31.852
I live in a world where most people
are too afraid to go.

00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:34.777
Surrounded by tall, concrete walls,

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:35.952
steel bars,

00:02:35.976 --> 00:02:37.270
where razor wire have a way

00:02:37.294 --> 00:02:40.380
of cutting away at the hopes
for a brighter tomorrow.

00:02:41.697 --> 00:02:42.848
I live in a world

00:02:42.872 --> 00:02:44.405
that kill people who kill people

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:45.580
in order to teach people

00:02:45.604 --> 00:02:47.000
that killing people is wrong.

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:49.577
Imagine that.

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:51.262
Better yet,

00:02:51.286 --> 00:02:54.356
imagine a world where healed people
helped hurt people heal

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.633
and become strong.

00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:59.618
Maybe then we would all
be singin' "Redemption Song."

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.989
I live in a world that
has been called "hell on Earth"

00:03:04.013 --> 00:03:05.723
by those trapped inside.

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:08.969
But I've come to the stark realization

00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:10.197
that prison --

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.316
it really is what you make it.

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:15.907
You see, in spite
of the harshness of my reality,

00:03:15.931 --> 00:03:17.391
there is a silver lining.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.288
I knew that my freedom was gonna come,

00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:21.701
it was just a matter of time.

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:25.117
And so I treated my first steps
as if they were my last mile,

00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:28.098
and I realized that you
don't have to be free

00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:29.791
in order to experience freedom.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.649
And just because you're free,

00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:34.470
doesn't mean that you have freedom.

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:38.242
Many of us, for years,
have been battling our inner demons.

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:41.607
We walk around smiling
when inside we're really screamin':

00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:42.781
freedom!

00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:45.321
Don't you get it?

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:47.503
We're all serving time;

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.099
we're just in different places.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.931
As for me,

00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:53.535
I choose to be free
from the prisons I've created.

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:54.710
The key:

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:55.885
forgiveness.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.060
Action's my witness.

00:03:57.084 --> 00:03:58.234
If we want freedom,

00:03:59.122 --> 00:04:00.669
then we gotta think different.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.840
Because freedom ...

00:04:05.227 --> 00:04:06.377
it isn't a place.

00:04:07.783 --> 00:04:08.933
It's a mind setting.

00:04:10.996 --> 00:04:12.147
Thank you.

00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:15.512
(Applause)

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:22.536
(Piano)

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.710
John Legend: Old pirates, yes, they rob I.

00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:40.987
Sold I to the merchant ships.

00:04:43.414 --> 00:04:47.598
Minutes after they took I

00:04:47.622 --> 00:04:49.589
from the bottomless pit.

00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:54.977
My hands were made strong

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.207
by the hand of the almighty.

00:05:00.213 --> 00:05:03.371
We forward in this generation

00:05:05.798 --> 00:05:07.844
triumphantly.

00:05:09.343 --> 00:05:12.851
Won't you help to sing

00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:17.401
these songs of freedom?

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:20.754
'Cause all I ever had --

00:05:23.238 --> 00:05:25.603
redemption songs.

00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:30.153
Redemption songs.

00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:36.253
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.

00:05:36.277 --> 00:05:39.848
None but ourselves can free our minds.

00:05:41.253 --> 00:05:44.447
Have no fear for atomic energy

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:48.566
'cause none of them can stop the time.

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.609
How long shall they kill our prophets

00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:56.395
while we stand aside and look?

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:01.677
Some say it's just a part of it,

00:06:02.447 --> 00:06:04.971
we've got to fulfill the book.

00:06:06.877 --> 00:06:10.226
Won't you help to sing

00:06:12.048 --> 00:06:14.468
these songs of freedom?

00:06:15.263 --> 00:06:18.183
'Cause all I ever had --

00:06:20.322 --> 00:06:22.671
redemption songs.

00:06:24.387 --> 00:06:26.752
Redemption songs.

00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:33.776
(Piano)

00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:47.735
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.

00:06:48.423 --> 00:06:52.113
None but ourselves can free our minds.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.404
Have no fear for atomic energy

00:06:57.059 --> 00:07:00.281
'cause none of them can stop the time.

00:07:00.933 --> 00:07:04.440
How long shall they kill our prophets

00:07:05.146 --> 00:07:08.154
while we stand aside and look?

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:12.746
Some say it's just a part of it,

00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:16.317
we've got to fulfill the book.

00:07:18.151 --> 00:07:21.397
Won't you help to sing

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:25.634
these songs of freedom?

00:07:26.418 --> 00:07:29.354
'Cause all I ever had --

00:07:31.508 --> 00:07:34.167
redemption songs.

00:07:35.828 --> 00:07:38.238
Redemption songs.

00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:42.412
These songs of freedom.

00:07:43.428 --> 00:07:47.666
'Cause all I ever had --

00:07:48.883 --> 00:07:51.215
redemption songs.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.663
Redemption songs.

00:07:57.695 --> 00:08:04.695
Redemption songs.

00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:07.451
(Piano)

00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:14.057
(Applause)

00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:15.231
Thank you.

00:08:15.584 --> 00:08:16.736
Thank you.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.667
(Applause)
