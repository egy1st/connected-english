00:00:00.844 --> 00:00:02.905
I used to have this recurring dream

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:05.341
where I'd walk into a roomful of people,

00:00:06.388 --> 00:00:08.960
and I'd try not to make
eye contact with anyone.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.935
Until someone notices me,

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.402
and I just panic.

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:16.017
And the person walks up to me,

00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:18.550
and says, "Hi, my name is So-and-so.

00:00:18.574 --> 00:00:19.933
And what is your name?"

00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:23.498
And I'm just quiet, unable to respond.

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:27.639
After some awkward silence, he goes,

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:29.244
"Have you forgotten your name?"

00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:31.300
And I'm still quiet.

00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:36.939
And then, slowly, all the other people
in the room begin to turn toward me

00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:39.218
and ask, almost in unison,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.592
(Voice-over, several voices)
"Have you forgotten your name?"

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:47.706
As the chant gets louder,
I want to respond, but I don't.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.849
I'm a visual artist.

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:55.335
Some of my work is humorous,

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.960
and some is a bit funny but in a sad way.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.867
And one thing that I really enjoy doing

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:07.157
is making these little animations

00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:10.955
where I get to do the voice-over
for all kinds of characters.

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.237
I've been a bear.

00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:14.330
(Video) Bear (Safwat Saleem's voice): Hi.

00:01:14.354 --> 00:01:16.105
(Laughter)

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:17.789
Safwat Saleem: I've been a whale.

00:01:17.813 --> 00:01:19.502
(Video) Whale (SS's voice): Hi.

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:20.789
(Laughter)

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.277
SS: I've been a greeting card.

00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:24.354
(Video) Greeting card (SS's voice): Hi.

00:01:24.378 --> 00:01:25.457
(Laughter)

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:28.488
SS: And my personal favorite
is Frankenstein's monster.

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:31.209
(Video) Frankenstein's monster
(SS's voice): (Grunts)

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:32.273
(Laughter)

00:01:32.297 --> 00:01:34.397
SS: I just had to grunt
a lot for that one.

00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:37.104
A few years ago,
I made this educational video

00:01:37.128 --> 00:01:40.024
about the history of video games.

00:01:40.048 --> 00:01:43.790
And for that one, I got to do
the voice of Space Invader.

00:01:43.814 --> 00:01:45.870
(Video) Space Invader (SS's voice): Hi.

00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:47.341
SS: A dream come true, really,

00:01:47.365 --> 00:01:48.367
(Laughter)

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.470
And when that video was posted online,

00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:53.184
I just sat there on the computer,
hitting "refresh,"

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:54.684
excited to see the response.

00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:56.622
The first comment comes in.

00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:57.940
(Video) Comment: Great job.

00:01:57.964 --> 00:01:59.114
SS: Yes!

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:00.964
I hit "refresh."

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:04.091
(Video) Comment: Excellent video.
I look forward to the next one.

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.611
SS: This was just the first
of a two-part video.

00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:08.676
I was going to work
on the second one next.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.866
I hit "refresh."

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.726
(Video) Comment: Where is part TWO?
WHEREEEEE? I need it NOWWWWW!: P

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.268
(Laughter)

00:02:15.292 --> 00:02:18.235
SS: People other than my mom
were saying nice things about me,

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:19.425
on the Internet!

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:21.782
It felt like I had finally arrived.

00:02:21.806 --> 00:02:23.108
I hit "refresh."

00:02:23.132 --> 00:02:25.831
(Video) Comment: His voice
is annoying. No offense.

00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:28.525
SS: OK, no offense taken. Refresh.

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.113
(Video) Comment: Could you remake this
without peanut butter in your mouth?

00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:36.604
SS: OK, at least the feedback
is somewhat constructive. Hit "refresh."

00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:39.174
(Video) Comment: Please don't use
this narrator again

00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:40.560
u can barely understand him.

00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:41.735
SS: Refresh.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.739
(Video) Comment: Couldn't follow
because of the Indian accent.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:46.247
SS: OK, OK, OK, two things.

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:48.343
Number one, I don't have an Indian accent,

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.294
I have a Pakistani accent, OK?

00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:53.458
And number two, I clearly
have a Pakistani accent.

00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:55.503
(Laughter)

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:58.258
But comments like that kept coming in,

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:01.027
so I figured I should just ignore them

00:03:01.051 --> 00:03:03.640
and start working
on the second part of the video.

00:03:04.104 --> 00:03:05.634
I recorded my audio,

00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:08.657
but every time I sat down to edit,

00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:10.354
I just could not do it.

00:03:11.688 --> 00:03:14.676
Every single time, it would take me
back to my childhood,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.521
when I had a much harder time speaking.

00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:20.738
I've stuttered for as long
as I can remember.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.562
I was the kid in class

00:03:23.586 --> 00:03:26.223
who would never raise his hand
when he had a question --

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.421
or knew the answer.

00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:28.760
Every time the phone rang,

00:03:28.784 --> 00:03:32.419
I would run to the bathroom
so I would not have to answer it.

00:03:32.907 --> 00:03:36.116
If it was for me, my parents
would say I'm not around.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.070
I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.

00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:42.192
And I hated introducing myself,

00:03:42.216 --> 00:03:43.825
especially in groups.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.225
I'd always stutter on my name,
and there was usually someone who'd go,

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:48.776
"Have you forgotten your name?"

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.377
And then everybody would laugh.

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:53.006
That joke never got old.

00:03:54.727 --> 00:03:57.310
(Laughter)

00:03:57.635 --> 00:04:01.442
I spent my childhood
feeling that if I spoke,

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:06.621
it would become obvious
that there was something wrong with me,

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:08.142
that I was not normal.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.729
So I mostly stayed quiet.

00:04:12.142 --> 00:04:15.905
And so you see, eventually for me to even
be able to use my voice in my work

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:17.502
was a huge step for me.

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.587
Every time I record audio,

00:04:19.611 --> 00:04:23.106
I fumble my way through saying
each sentence many, many times,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.764
and then I go back in

00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:28.370
and pick the ones
where I think I suck the least.

00:04:30.997 --> 00:04:34.076
(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing
is like Photoshop for your voice.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.911
I can slow it down, speed it up,
make it deeper, add an echo.

00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:41.682
And if I stutter along the way,
and if I stutter along the way,

00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:43.325
I just go back in and fix it.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:44.744
It's magic.

00:04:44.768 --> 00:04:47.673
SS: Using my highly edited
voice in my work

00:04:47.697 --> 00:04:51.252
was a way for me
to finally sound normal to myself.

00:04:52.302 --> 00:04:54.447
But after the comments on the video,

00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:56.929
it no longer made me feel normal.

00:04:57.897 --> 00:05:00.270
And so I stopped
using my voice in my work.

00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:05.750
Since then, I've thought a lot
about what it means to be normal.

00:05:07.218 --> 00:05:09.236
And I've come to understand

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.639
that "normal" has a lot to do
with expectations.

00:05:13.307 --> 00:05:14.836
Let me give you an example.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.190
I came across this story

00:05:16.214 --> 00:05:18.480
about the Ancient Greek writer, Homer.

00:05:18.504 --> 00:05:21.753
Now, Homer mentions
very few colors in his writing.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.255
And even when he does,

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.317
he seems to get them quite a bit wrong.

00:05:26.936 --> 00:05:30.228
For example, the sea
is described as wine red,

00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:33.799
people's faces are sometimes green
and sheep are purple.

00:05:34.838 --> 00:05:36.213
But it's not just Homer.

00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:38.546
If you look at all
of the ancient literature --

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.770
Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian

00:05:40.794 --> 00:05:43.471
and even the original Hebrew Bible --

00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:46.071
they all mention very few colors.

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:50.125
And the most popular theory
for why that might be the case

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.553
is that cultures begin
to recognize a color

00:05:52.577 --> 00:05:55.662
only once they have the ability
to make that color.

00:05:55.686 --> 00:05:57.536
So basically, if you can make a color,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.186
only then can you see it.

00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:03.386
A color like red, which was fairly easy
for many cultures to make --

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.241
they began to see that color
fairly early on.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:09.008
But a color like blue,
which was much harder to make --

00:06:09.032 --> 00:06:11.785
many cultures didn't begin to learn
how to make that color

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:12.975
until much later.

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:15.515
They didn't begin to see it
until much later as well.

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.189
So until then, even though
a color might be all around them,

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:21.658
they simply did not have
the ability to see it.

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:22.840
It was invisIble.

00:06:22.864 --> 00:06:25.244
It was not a part of their normal.

00:06:26.593 --> 00:06:29.495
And that story has helped
put my own experience into context.

00:06:30.376 --> 00:06:32.846
So when I first read
the comments on the video,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.765
my initial reaction was to take it
all very personally.

00:06:36.543 --> 00:06:38.441
But the people commenting did not know

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:41.325
how self-conscious I am about my voice.

00:06:42.258 --> 00:06:44.905
They were mostly reacting to my accent,

00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:48.446
that it is not normal
for a narrator to have an accent.

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:50.592
But what is normal, anyway?

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:54.835
We know that reviewers will find
more spelling errors in your writing

00:06:54.859 --> 00:06:56.230
if they think you're black.

00:06:57.144 --> 00:07:01.436
We know that professors are less likely
to help female or minority students.

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.996
And we know that resumes
with white-sounding names

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.913
get more callbacks than resumes
with black-sounding names.

00:07:09.043 --> 00:07:10.241
Why is that?

00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:13.454
Because of our expectations
of what is normal.

00:07:14.135 --> 00:07:15.714
We think it is normal

00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:17.843
when a black student has spelling errors.

00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:19.979
We think it is normal

00:07:20.003 --> 00:07:23.195
when a female or minority student
does not succeed.

00:07:23.962 --> 00:07:25.601
And we think it is normal

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:28.711
that a white employee
is a better hire than a black employee.

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:31.993
But studies also show
that discrimination of this kind,

00:07:32.017 --> 00:07:34.062
in most cases, is simply favoritism,

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:37.604
and it results more from wanting
to help people that you can relate to

00:07:38.493 --> 00:07:41.690
than the desire to harm people
that you can't relate to.

00:07:42.944 --> 00:07:46.151
And not relating to people
starts at a very early age.

00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:47.555
Let me give you an example.

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:51.498
One library that keeps track of characters

00:07:51.522 --> 00:07:54.815
in the children's book
collection every year,

00:07:54.839 --> 00:08:00.120
found that in 2014,
only about 11 percent of the books

00:08:00.144 --> 00:08:02.344
had a character of color.

00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:06.045
And just the year before,
that number was about eight percent,

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.877
even though half of American children
today come from a minority background.

00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:11.051
Half.

00:08:11.353 --> 00:08:12.977
So there are two big issues here.

00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:15.658
Number one, children are told
that they can be anything,

00:08:15.682 --> 00:08:16.833
they can do anything,

00:08:16.857 --> 00:08:19.330
and yet, most stories
that children of color consume

00:08:19.354 --> 00:08:21.232
are about people who are not like them.

00:08:21.256 --> 00:08:24.015
Number two is that majority groups
don't get to realize

00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:27.072
the great extent to which
they are similar to minorities --

00:08:27.096 --> 00:08:30.143
our everyday experiences, our hopes,

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:32.039
our dreams, our fears

00:08:32.063 --> 00:08:33.836
and our mutual love for hummus.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.169
It's delicious!

00:08:35.193 --> 00:08:36.900
(Laughter)

00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:40.594
Just like the color blue
for Ancient Greeks,

00:08:40.618 --> 00:08:43.939
minorities are not a part
of what we consider normal,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.401
because normal is simply a construction
of what we've been exposed to,

00:08:50.425 --> 00:08:52.214
and how visible it is around us.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.722
And this is where things
get a bit difficult.

00:08:56.714 --> 00:09:00.994
I can accept the preexisting notion
of normal -- that normal is good,

00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:05.033
and anything outside of that very
narrow definition of normal is bad.

00:09:05.758 --> 00:09:09.604
Or I can challenge
that preexisting notion of normal

00:09:10.462 --> 00:09:11.635
with my work

00:09:12.034 --> 00:09:13.310
and with my voice

00:09:14.338 --> 00:09:15.761
and with my accent

00:09:16.632 --> 00:09:18.148
and by standing here onstage,

00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:21.495
even though I'm scared shitless
and would rather be in the bathroom.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.836
(Laughter)

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.677
(Applause)

00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:36.472
(Video) Sheep (SS's voice):
I'm now slowly starting to use my voice

00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:37.650
in my work again.

00:09:37.674 --> 00:09:38.825
And it feels good.

00:09:38.849 --> 00:09:40.817
It does not mean I won't have a breakdown

00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:43.308
the next time a couple dozen
people say that I talk

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:45.640
(Mumbling) like I have peanut
butter in my mouth.

00:09:45.664 --> 00:09:46.666
(Laughter)

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.370
SS: It just means I now have
a much better understanding

00:09:49.394 --> 00:09:51.138
of what's at stake,

00:09:51.162 --> 00:09:53.662
and how giving up is not an option.

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:59.405
The Ancient Greeks didn't just wake up
one day and realize

00:09:59.429 --> 00:10:00.754
that the sky was blue.

00:10:01.197 --> 00:10:04.635
It took centuries, even, for humans
to realize what we had been ignoring

00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:05.828
for so long.

00:10:06.893 --> 00:10:10.714
And so we must continuously challenge
our notion of normal,

00:10:10.738 --> 00:10:15.070
because doing so is going
to allow us as a society

00:10:15.094 --> 00:10:17.630
to finally see the sky for what it is.

00:10:20.272 --> 00:10:26.036
(Video) Characters: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.651
Frankenstein's monster: (Grunts)

00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:28.686
(Laughter)

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.861
SS: Thank you.

00:10:29.885 --> 00:10:33.768
(Applause)
