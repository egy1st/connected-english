00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Thank you very much.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Good morning everybody.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We are They Might Be Giants.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
(Applause)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I am wearing the Al Gore in-ear monitors

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
he wore on the Larry King show

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and I'm hearing that transmission and not mine.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But I guess that's in keeping,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This is a brand new song.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In the spirit of TED, we're bringing you something

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that has not been released.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
John, do you want to introduce the song?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
which imitates another creature

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which imitates yet another creature.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It's completely fucked up

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and can only be explained in song.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
♫ Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying ♫

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
♫ You can't walk, you can't ramble ♫

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
♫ 'cause you're gonna have to scramble ♫

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
♫ from the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
♫ Catbird is a cat ♫

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
♫ but he's got bugness in his veins. ♫

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
♫ Manhouse lives within himself ♫

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
♫ the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
♫ Now the moth ♫

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
♫ defeats the mouse and man. ♫

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
♫ It's messing with the plan. ♫

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
♫ It can't be believed ♫

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
♫ 'cause it's just a hummingbird moth ♫

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
♫ who's acting like the bird ♫

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
♫ that thinks it's a bee. ♫

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
♫ Got a brand new shipment ♫

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
♫ of electrical equipment ♫

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000

♫ Send a tangerine-colored ♫

♫ Windshield wiper washer fluid ♫

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000

♫ headlights under head lice ♫

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
♫ Now the moth defeats the mouse and man. ♫

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
♫ Everyone's deforming ♫

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
(Applause)

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Thanks a lot.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Thank you very much.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So we are past our 1,000th show.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Probably somewhere around 1,500.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
It's hard to know.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
We've only done two shows in 2007 so far,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
but our first show

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
was actually the coldest performance we've ever had.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It was 19 degrees in St. Louis about a month ago

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and I'm happy to report

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that this performance you are seeing today

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
is the earliest we have ever performed.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So thank you.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
How early can a rock performance begin?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Not all the facts are in about performing

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
at 8.30 in the morning.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I can tell you the 19 degree thing

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
was fantastic.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
All right.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So we don't know that much

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
about the history of violinists

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
but we do know that when we entered

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
the state of New Jersey

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
there is an uptick in violence.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
This song is called "Asbury Park."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It's based on a real life experience.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
♫ I ♫

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
♫ I got ♫

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
♫ I got kicked ♫

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
♫ I got kicked in the head ♫

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
♫ backstage at the Stone. ♫

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
♫ Stone Pone. ♫

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
♫ Stone Pony. ♫

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
♫ I got kicked in the head ♫

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
♫ backstage at the Stone Pony ♫

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
♫ where I swore to the guy ♫

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
♫ that the guy who took his beer wasn't me. ♫

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
♫ Me got ♫

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
♫ Me got kicked ♫

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
♫ Me got kicked in the head ♫

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
♫ backstage at the Stone. ♫

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
♫ Stone Pone. ♫

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
♫ Stone Pony. ♫

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
♫ Me got kicked in the head ♫

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
♫ backstage at the Stone Pony ♫

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
♫ where I swore to the guy ♫

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
♫ that the guy who took his beer ♫

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
♫ was a guy dressed like me. ♫

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
♫ Not me! ♫

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
♫ Not me! ♫

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
♫ Not me! ♫

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Thank you.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Marty Beller on the drums over there.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
(Applause)

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
We want to get in as many songs as possible

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
during our brief time here

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
so this is the one to play.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
This song is called "Fingertips."

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
♫ Everything is catching on fire ♫

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
♫ Yes, everything is catching on fire ♫

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
♫ Yes, everything is catching on fire. ♫

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
♫ Fingertips ♫

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
♫ Fingertips ♫

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
♫ Fingertips ♫

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
♫ I hear the wind blow ♫

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
♫ I hear the wind blow ♫

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
♫ It seems to say ♫

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
♫ Hello ♫

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
♫ Hello ♫

♫ Who's that standing ♫

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
♫ at the window?♫

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
♫ I found a new friend ♫

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
♫ Come on and wreck my car ♫

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
♫ Come on and wreck my car ♫

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000

♫ Come on and wreck my car ♫

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
♫ Aren't you the guy who hit me in the eye? ♫

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
♫ Aren't you the guy who hit me in the eye? ♫

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000

♫ Leave me alone, leave me alone. ♫

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
♫ Who's knocking on the wall? ♫

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
♫ All alone, all alone. ♫

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
♫ All by myself. ♫

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
♫ What's that blue thing doing here? ♫

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
♫ Something grabbed ahold of my hand ♫

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
♫ I didn't know what had my hand ♫

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
♫ I don't understand you ♫

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
♫ See the sound ♫

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
♫ Turn around and see the thing ♫

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
♫ that made the sound. ♫

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
♫ Mysterious whisper ♫

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.000

♫ And I walk along darkened corridors ♫

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Thank you very much -- "Fingertips."

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
(Applause)

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
♫ We're taking calls -- from the dead. ♫

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
♫ We're taking calls -- from the dead. ♫

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
♫ We're taking phone calls from the dead. ♫

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
♫ They're calling from beyond the grave. ♫

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
♫ Beyond the grave. ♫

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
♫ They have some questions ♫

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
♫ And things to share ♫

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
♫ From underneath the cold, cold ground. ♫

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
We're soliciting phone calls from dead people

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
as a special TED presentation.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
We're taking calls live on stage

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
here at TED in Monterey.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And I think we have a caller coming in here.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Hello there.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
You're live.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Hello. Who's there, please?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Am I on the air?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Hi there.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
You're on with They Might Be Giants.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This is Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Hello, Eleanor, please ...

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I want to talk to ...

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Please turn off your radio, Eleanor.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I wanna talk to Randi.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I've got a question for Randi.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
What's your question, please?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
I want to talk to the Amazing Randi.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Do you have a laminated badge, Eleanor?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I want my million dollars.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Eleanor, I'm sorry,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
do you have a laminated badge?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
No, I don't have a badge.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Well, I think we're going to stop

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
that part of the show.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Here's a song we like to think of

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
as the future anthem of TED.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
It's actually a children's song

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
but like so many projects for children

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
it's really just a Trojan horse

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
for adult work.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
This song is called

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
"The Alphabet ...

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Of Nations!"
