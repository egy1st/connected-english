00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:10.758
Hi. My name is Marwa,
and I'm an architect.

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:12.993
I was born and raised in Homs,

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:15.735
a city in the central
western part of Syria,

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.088
and I've always lived here.

00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:19.477
After six years of war,

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.429
Homs is now a half-destroyed city.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.128
My family and I were lucky;
our place is still standing.

00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:28.335
Although for two years,
we were like prisoners at home.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.048
Outside there were demonstrations
and battles and bombings and snipers.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.132
My husband and I used to run
an architecture studio

00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:38.798
in the old town main square.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.092
It's gone, as is most
of the old town itself.

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:44.566
Half of the city's other neighborhoods

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.747
are now rubble.

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:48.646
Since the ceasefire in late 2015,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.585
large parts of Homs
have been more or less quiet.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.302
The economy is completely broken,
and people are still fighting.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.803
The merchants who had stalls
in the old city market

00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:00.272
now trade out of sheds on the streets.

00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:02.792
Under our apartment, there is a carpenter,

00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:07.362
sweetshops, a butcher, a printing house,
workshops, among many more.

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:10.375
I have started teaching part-time,

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.913
and with my husband,
who juggles several jobs,

00:01:12.937 --> 00:01:14.573
we've opened a small bookshop.

00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:17.763
Other people do all sorts
of jobs to get by.

00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:22.057
When I look at my destroyed city,
of course, I ask myself:

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.008
What has led to this senseless war?

00:01:24.778 --> 00:01:27.009
Syria was largely a place of tolerance,

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:29.073
historically accustomed to variety,

00:01:29.097 --> 00:01:32.378
accommodating a wide range
of beliefs, origins, customs,

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:33.585
goods, food.

00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:35.480
How did my country --

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:38.202
a country with communities
living harmoniously together

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:40.717
and comfortable in discussing
their differences --

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:44.826
how did it degenerate into civil war,
violence, displacement

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.755
and unprecedented sectarian hatred?

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:51.047
There were many reasons
that had led to the war --

00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:53.156
social, political and economic.

00:01:53.743 --> 00:01:55.307
They all have played their role.

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:59.203
But I believe there is one key reason
that has been overlooked

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:01.137
and which is important to analyze,

00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:03.487
because from it will largely depend

00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:06.438
whether we can make sure
that this doesn't happen again.

00:02:07.372 --> 00:02:09.364
And that reason is architecture.

00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:12.399
Architecture in my country
has played an important role

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:16.443
in creating, directing and amplifying
conflict between warring factions,

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:19.343
and this is probably true
for other countries as well.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.282
There is a sure correspondence
between the architecture of a place

00:02:23.306 --> 00:02:26.243
and the character of the community
that has settled there.

00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:30.426
Architecture plays a key role
in whether a community crumbles

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.689
or comes together.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.565
Syrian society has long lived
the coexistence

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.945
of different traditions and backgrounds.

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.699
Syrians have experienced
the prosperity of open trade

00:02:39.723 --> 00:02:41.475
and sustainable communities.

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.570
They have enjoyed the true meaning
of belonging to a place,

00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:47.297
and that was reflected
in their built environment,

00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:49.789
in the mosques and churches
built back-to-back,

00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:52.060
in the interwoven souks and public venues,

00:02:52.084 --> 00:02:56.297
and the proportions and sizes based
on principles of humanity and harmony.

00:02:56.948 --> 00:03:00.360
This architecture of mixity
can still be read in the remains.

00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:04.122
The old Islamic city in Syria
was built over a multilayered past,

00:03:04.147 --> 00:03:06.578
integrating with it
and embracing its spirit.

00:03:06.602 --> 00:03:08.229
So did its communities.

00:03:08.253 --> 00:03:10.181
People lived and worked with each other

00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:12.411
in a place that gave them
a sense of belonging

00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:14.440
and made them feel at home.

00:03:14.464 --> 00:03:16.764
They shared a remarkably
unified existence.

00:03:17.748 --> 00:03:19.213
But over the last century,

00:03:19.237 --> 00:03:23.738
gradually this delicate balance
of these places has been interfered with;

00:03:23.762 --> 00:03:26.442
first, by the urban planners
of the colonial period,

00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:28.680
when the French went
enthusiastically about,

00:03:28.704 --> 00:03:31.962
transforming what they saw
as the un-modern Syrian cities.

00:03:31.986 --> 00:03:34.963
They blew up city streets
and relocated monuments.

00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:38.231
They called them improvements,

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:41.631
and they were the beginning
of a long, slow unraveling.

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:44.545
The traditional urbanism
and architecture of our cities

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.735
assured identity and belonging
not by separation,

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:49.513
but by intertwining.

00:03:49.537 --> 00:03:53.274
But over time, the ancient became
worthless, and the new, coveted.

00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:56.633
The harmony of the built environment
and social environment

00:03:56.657 --> 00:03:59.320
got trampled over
by elements of modernity --

00:03:59.344 --> 00:04:01.526
brutal, unfinished concrete blocks,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.249
neglect, aesthetic devastation,

00:04:04.273 --> 00:04:09.414
divisive urbanism that zoned
communities by class, creed or affluence.

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.328
And the same was happening
to the community.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.947
As the shape of the built
environment changed,

00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:18.279
so the lifestyles and sense
of belonging of the communities

00:04:18.303 --> 00:04:20.014
also started changing.

00:04:20.038 --> 00:04:22.655
From a register
of togetherness, of belonging,

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.250
architecture became
a way of differentiation,

00:04:25.274 --> 00:04:27.671
and communities started drifting apart

00:04:27.695 --> 00:04:30.666
from the very fabric
that used to unite them,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.417
and from the soul of the place that used
to represent their common existence.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.830
While many reasons had led
to the Syrian war,

00:04:37.854 --> 00:04:39.973
we shouldn't underestimate
the way in which,

00:04:39.997 --> 00:04:43.846
by contributing to the loss 
of identity and self-respect,

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.247
urban zoning and misguided,
inhumane architecture

00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:49.980
have nurtured sectarian
divisions and hatred.

00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:53.805
Over time, the united city
has morphed into a city center

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:56.346
with ghettos along its circumference.

00:04:56.782 --> 00:05:00.847
And in turn, the coherent communities
became distinct social groups,

00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:04.147
alienated from each other
and alienated from the place.

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:06.491
From my point of view,

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.632
losing the sense of belonging to a place

00:05:08.656 --> 00:05:10.828
and a sense of sharing it
with someone else

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.172
has made it a lot easier to destroy.

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:16.880
The clear example can be seen
in the informal housing system,

00:05:16.904 --> 00:05:21.400
which used to host, before the war,
over 40 percent of the population.

00:05:21.424 --> 00:05:25.234
Yes, prior to the war,
almost half of the Syrian population

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:26.693
lived in slums,

00:05:26.717 --> 00:05:29.819
peripheral areas
without proper infrastructure,

00:05:29.843 --> 00:05:32.716
made of endless rows of bare block boxes

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.168
containing people,

00:05:34.192 --> 00:05:36.327
people who mostly belonged
to the same group,

00:05:36.351 --> 00:05:40.541
whether based on religion,
class, origin or all of the above.

00:05:41.772 --> 00:05:46.406
This ghettoized urbanism
proved to be a tangible precursor of war.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.784
Conflict is much easier
between pre-categorized areas --

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.101
where the "others" live.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.283
The ties that used
to bind the city together --

00:05:54.307 --> 00:05:56.967
whether they were social,
through coherent building,

00:05:56.991 --> 00:05:59.124
or economic, through trade in the souk,

00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:02.034
or religious, through
the coexistent presence --

00:06:02.058 --> 00:06:05.770
were all lost in the misguided
and visionless modernization

00:06:05.794 --> 00:06:07.158
of the built environment.

00:06:07.782 --> 00:06:09.047
Allow me an aside.

00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:13.650
When I read about heterogeneous urbanism
in other parts of the world,

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:16.146
involving ethnic neighborhoods
in British cities

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.279
or around Paris or Brussels,

00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:21.897
I recognize the beginning
of the kind of instability

00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:24.851
we have witnessed
so disastrously here in Syria.

00:06:26.027 --> 00:06:28.233
We have severely destroyed cities,

00:06:28.257 --> 00:06:31.438
such as Homs, Aleppo,
Daraa and many others,

00:06:31.462 --> 00:06:35.321
and almost half of the population
of the country is now displaced.

00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:37.493
Hopefully, the war will end,

00:06:37.517 --> 00:06:41.011
and the question that,
as an architect, I have to ask, is:

00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:42.793
How do we rebuild?

00:06:43.317 --> 00:06:45.953
What are the principles
that we should adopt

00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:48.735
in order to avoid repeating
the same mistakes?

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:52.638
From my point of view, the main focus
should be on creating places

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.830
that make their people feel they belong.

00:06:54.854 --> 00:06:57.349
Architecture and planning
need to recapture

00:06:57.373 --> 00:07:00.277
some of the traditional values
that did just that,

00:07:00.301 --> 00:07:03.532
creating the conditions
for coexistence and peace,

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:06.824
values of beauty
that don't exhibit ostentation,

00:07:06.848 --> 00:07:09.213
but rather, approachability and ease,

00:07:09.237 --> 00:07:12.744
moral values that promote
generosity and acceptance,

00:07:12.768 --> 00:07:16.745
architecture that is for everyone
to enjoy, not just for the elite,

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:20.421
just as used to be in the shadowed alleys
of the old Islamic city,

00:07:20.445 --> 00:07:23.278
mixed designs that encourage
a sense of community.

00:07:24.326 --> 00:07:27.565
There is a neighborhood here in Homs
that's called Baba Amr

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:29.252
that has been fully destroyed.

00:07:29.714 --> 00:07:32.240
Almost two years ago,
I introduced this design

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:35.261
into a UN-Habitat competition
for rebuilding it.

00:07:35.285 --> 00:07:39.623
The idea was to create an urban fabric
inspired by a tree,

00:07:39.647 --> 00:07:42.568
capable of growing
and spreading organically,

00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:45.814
echoing the traditional bridge
hanging over the old alleys,

00:07:45.838 --> 00:07:49.590
and incorporating apartments,
private courtyards, shops,

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:52.987
workshops, places for parking
and playing and leisure,

00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:54.594
trees and shaded areas.

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:57.611
It's far from perfect, obviously.

00:07:57.635 --> 00:08:00.906
I drew it during the few hours
of electricity we get.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.528
And there are many possible ways
to express belonging and community

00:08:04.552 --> 00:08:05.703
through architecture.

00:08:05.727 --> 00:08:08.771
But compare it with the freestanding,
disconnected blocks

00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:12.750
proposed by the official project
for rebuilding Baba Amr.

00:08:12.774 --> 00:08:16.382
Architecture is not the axis
around which all human life rotates,

00:08:16.406 --> 00:08:20.778
but it has the power to suggest
and even direct human activity.

00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:25.383
In that sense, settlement,
identity and social integration

00:08:25.407 --> 00:08:29.328
are all the producer and product
of effective urbanism.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.946
The coherent urbanism
of the old Islamic city

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.866
and of many old European
towns, for instance,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.623
promote integration,

00:08:37.647 --> 00:08:40.884
while rows of soulless housing
or tower blocks,

00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:42.673
even when they are luxurious,

00:08:42.697 --> 00:08:45.362
tend to promote isolation and "otherness."

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.208
Even simple things

00:08:47.232 --> 00:08:51.088
like shaded places or fruit plants
or drinking water inside the city

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:54.287
can make a difference
in how people feel towards the place,

00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:57.500
and whether they consider it
a generous place that gives,

00:08:57.524 --> 00:09:00.696
a place that's worth keeping,
contributing to,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.077
or whether they see it
as an alienating place,

00:09:03.101 --> 00:09:04.576
full of seeds of anger.

00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:09.307
In order for a place to give,
its architecture should be giving, too.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.104
Our built environment matters.

00:09:12.128 --> 00:09:16.112
The fabric of our cities is reflected
in the fabric of our souls.

00:09:16.802 --> 00:09:19.753
And whether in the shape
of informal concrete slums

00:09:19.777 --> 00:09:21.403
or broken social housing

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:23.186
or trampled old towns

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.956
or forests of skyscrapers,

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.083
the contemporary urban archetypes

00:09:27.107 --> 00:09:29.815
that have emerged
all across the Middle East

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:34.138
have been one cause of the alienation
and fragmentation of our communities.

00:09:34.971 --> 00:09:36.464
We can learn from this.

00:09:36.488 --> 00:09:39.341
We can learn how to rebuild
in another way,

00:09:39.365 --> 00:09:42.682
how to create an architecture
that doesn't contribute only

00:09:42.706 --> 00:09:45.663
to the practical and economic
aspects of people's lives,

00:09:45.687 --> 00:09:49.606
but also to their social, spiritual
and psychological needs.

00:09:50.043 --> 00:09:53.948
Those needs were totally overlooked
in the Syrian cities before the war.

00:09:54.575 --> 00:09:57.318
We need to create again
cities that are shared

00:09:57.342 --> 00:09:59.373
by the communities that inhabit them.

00:09:59.777 --> 00:10:02.666
If we do so, people will not feel the need

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:06.539
to seek identities opposed
to the other identities all around,

00:10:06.563 --> 00:10:09.658
because they will all feel at home.

00:10:10.246 --> 00:10:11.634
Thank you for listening.
