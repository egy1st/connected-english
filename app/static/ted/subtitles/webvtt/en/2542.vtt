00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.536
Tonight, I'm going to share with you
my passion for science.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.576
I'm not talking about science
that takes baby steps.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.856
I'm talking about science
that takes enormous leaps.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.256
I'm talking Darwin, I'm talking Einstein,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.880
I'm talking revolutionary science
that turns the world on its head.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.840
In a moment, I'm going to talk
about two ideas that might do this.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.016
I say "might"

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.816
because, with revolutionary ideas,
most are flat wrong,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.296
and even those that are right
seldom have the impact

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.016
that we want them to have.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.536
To explain why I picked
two ideas in particular,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.240
I'm going to start with a mystery.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.920
1847, Vienna, Austria.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.696
Ignaz Semmelweis was a somber,
compulsively thorough doctor

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.576
who ran two maternity clinics.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.040
They were identical except for one thing.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.376
Women were dying of high fevers
soon after giving birth

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.960
three times more often
at one of the clinics than at the other.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.536
Trying to figure out
what the difference was that caused this,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.576
Semmelweis looked at everything he could.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.336
Sanitation? No.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.360
Medical procedures? No.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.920
Air flow? No.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.056
The puzzle went unsolved
until he happened to autopsy a doctor

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.080
who died of an infected scalpel cut.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.536
The doctor's symptoms were identical
to those of the mothers who were dying.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.936
How was that possible?

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.840
How could a male doctor
get the same thing as new mothers?

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.816
Semmelweis reconstructed
everything the doctor had done

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.096
right before he got sick,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.416
and he discovered
that he'd been autopsying a corpse.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.240
Had something gotten
in his wound that killed him?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.536
With growing excitement,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.376
Semmelweis looked
for any connection he could

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.776
between dead bodies in the morgue
and dead mothers in his delivery room,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.400
and he found it.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.176
It turned out that at the hospital
with the high death rate,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.976
but not the others,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.136
doctors delivered babies immediately
after autopsying corpses in the morgue.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.096
Aha! Corpses were contaminating
the doctors' hands

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.360
and killing his mothers.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.295
So he ordered the doctors
to sterilize their hands,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.600
and the deaths stopped.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.800
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis
had discovered infectious disease.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.816
But the doctors of the day
thought he was crazy,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.336
because they knew,
and had for hundreds of years,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.456
that odorous vapors
called miasmas caused disease,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.880
not these hypothetical particles
that you couldn't see.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.056
It took 20 years
for Frenchman Louis Pasteur

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.040
to prove that Semmelweis was right.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.376
Pasteur was an agricultural chemist

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.576
who tried to figure out
why milk and beer spoiled so often.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.040
He found that bacteria were the culprits.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.016
He also found that bacteria
could kill people in exactly the same way

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.360
that Semmelweis's patients were dying.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.520
We now look at what I want
to talk about tonight, in two ideas.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.520
We saw it with Semmelweis,
that he was a revolutionary.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.816
He did it for two reasons.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.080
One, he opened our eyes
to a completely new world.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.696
We'd known since the 1680s about bacteria.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.176
We just didn't know
that bacteria killed people.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.256
And he also demolished fond ideas
that people kept close to their heart.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.600
Miasmas didn't kill people.
Bacteria killed people.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.416
So this brings me to the two ideas
I want to talk about tonight.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.256
One has opened our eyes
to a completely new universe,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.256
and the other attacks long-held beliefs.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.216
Let's get started with Dr. Eric Betzig.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.136
He's a physicist who has opened our eyes
to an entirely new world

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.040
by violating the laws of physics.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.000
Betzig is a true rebel.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.456
He quit a job at prestigious
Bell Laboratory

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.736
inventing new microscopes for biology

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.096
because he thought scientists
were taking his brilliant inventions

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.640
and doing lousy work with them.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.920
So he became a househusband,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.936
but he never lost his passion
for figuring out

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.856
how to get microscopes
to see finer and finer details

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.357
than had ever been seen before
or ever could be seen.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.416
This is crucial if we're ever
going to understand how cells work,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.935
and how cancer works,

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.376
and how something
150th the size of a head of a pin

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.536
can do all these amazing things,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.136
like make proteins

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.056
and move charges around

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.360
and all of those things.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.080
There's just one problem.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.016
There's this thing
called the law of physics,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.496
and part of the law of physics
is the thing called the diffraction limit.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.896
The diffraction limit is kind of like
when you go to a doctor's office,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.056
you can only see so far down,
no matter how good glasses you have.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.456
This was a so-called impossible problem.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.656
But one of Betzig's friends
figured out how to take a tiny molecule

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.096
that was smaller than
the best microscope could see

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.256
and get it to light up and fluoresce.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.776
"Aha!" Betzig said.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.496
"I think maybe the laws of physics
are not so unbreakable after all."

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.376
So he lashed together a microscope
in his friend's living room.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.216
He had no laboratory.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.816
This revolutionary instrument
got different protein molecules

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.400
to light up in different colors,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.776
and with a computer, he was able
to turn very, very fuzzy blurs

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.496
into very sharp dots and produce images
of unprecedented and startling clarity.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.816
For this work, last year,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.440
Eric Betzig won the Nobel Prize.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.576
Why?

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.696
Because now we can see
with unprecedented detail

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.536
things that we never had seen before,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.400
and now doctors can get
a better handle on things like cancer.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.576
But do you think
Betzig was satisfied there?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.896
No.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.776
He wanted movies.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.016
The problem was

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.016
that even the genius microscopes
that he invented were just too slow.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.296
So what did he do?

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.896
He came up with a 200-year-old idea

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.616
called moirÃ© patterns.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.096
So the way that works is
if you take two very, very fine patterns

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.896
and you move them across each other,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.936
you will see a gross pattern

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.440
that a microscope can see

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.456
that otherwise you would not
be able to see.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.776
So he applied this technique
to taking a really blurry image of a cell

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.376
and moving lots of structured
light patterns across it

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.840
until this cell became crystal clear.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.856
And here is the result:

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.616
a mysterious new world,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.776
full of strange things zipping around

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.200
doing things that
we don't know what they're doing.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.576
But when we figure it out,
we'll have a better handle on life itself.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.696
For example, those
green globs that you see?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.400
Those things are called clathrins.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.376
They're molecules
that protect other molecules

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.776
as they move through a cell.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.136
Unfortunately, viruses sometimes
hijack those to infect cells.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.256
Also, you see those little squiggly
wormlike things moving around?

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.576
Those are actin molecules.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.016
Unfortunately, viruses
also climb down those things

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.496
to get into the cell nucleus

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.640
to replicate themselves and make you sick.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.096
Now that we can look at movies

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.976
of what's actually going on
deep inside a cell,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.080
we have a much better chance
of curing viral diseases like AIDS.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.536
So when you look at a movie like this,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.560
it's very clear that Betzig has opened
our eyes to a completely new world.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.680
But he hasn't shattered
any cherished beliefs.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.136
That leads us to Dr. Aubrey de Grey

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.360
at Cambridge.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.776
De Grey definitely has scientists
squirming with an interesting idea:

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.176
we can be immortal.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.816
We can beat aging.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.400
Now, most scientists
think he's a crackpot.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.616
Any Biology 101 student knows

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.656
that aging is an inevitable
consequence of living.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.776
For example, when we eat,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.656
we take in food and we metabolize it,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.056
and that throws off
what we call free radicals.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.536
You might have heard of those.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.496
Also known as oxygen ions,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.896
those bind to our DNA, cause it to mutate,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.976
and cause us to get old and lose our hair.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.576
(Laughter)

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.336
It's just like, no, it's exactly like

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.536
oxygen binding to iron and making it rust.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.016
So you age because you rust out.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.216
(Laughter)

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.336
Oh, and scientists also know
there is something called immortality:

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.336
in cancer cells.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.656
So if you stop aging,

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.600
all of you are going to turn
into giant walking malignant tumors.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.840
These are cherished beliefs,
but could de Grey be on to something?

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.816
I think he deserves a closer look.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.976
First of all, I have a really hard time
seeing him as a crackpot.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.336
Yeah, he started off life
as a computer scientist,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.856
not a biologist,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.696
but he earned a PhD
in biology from Cambridge,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.096
and he has published
some very significant work

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.576
on mitochondrial DNA
and a bunch of other stuff.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.696
Secondly, he started
an antiaging foundation

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.296
that has identified
seven different causes of aging,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.576
to me, that seem very plausible,

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.736
and he is hot in pursuit
of fixes for every single one of them.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.776
For example, one of the reasons we age
is that our mitochondrial DNA mutates,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.480
and we get kind of old
and our cells lose energy.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.496
He believes, and he's made
a convincing case,

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.056
that using viruses we can do gene therapy,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.736
fix that DNA

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.480
and rejuvenate our cells.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.736
One more thing.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.616
We have an existent proof

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.360
that extreme longevity is possible.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.680
Bristlecone pine trees live 5,000 years,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.520
and some lobsters don't age at all.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.976
Now, this doesn't mean that de Grey
is going to revolutionize our lifespans.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.816
I mean, after all, we're not trees,
and most of us are not lobsters.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.056
(Laughter)

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.880
But I've got to believe that there are
Darwins and Einsteins out there,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.216
and I'll tell you why.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.440
Consider this:

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.456
there are seven times more people
alive today than during Darwin's time.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.936
There are four times as many people
alive today as Einstein.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.176
When you consider

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.416
that the proportion of scientists
in the population has skyrocketed,

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.816
there are now seven million scientists.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.280
I've got to believe, and I do believe,
that there's one of them out there

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.056
who is working right now in obscurity

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.496
to rock our lives,
and I don't know about you,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.336
but I can't wait to be rocked.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.616
Thank you.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:34.601
(Applause)
