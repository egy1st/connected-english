WEBVTT

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.536
I am British.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.696
(Laughter)

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.856
(Applause)

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.656
Never before has the phrase
"I am British" elicited so much pity.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.776
(Laughter)

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.536
I come from an island
where many of us like to believe

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.680
there's been a lot of continuity
over the last thousand years.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.136
We tend to have historically
imposed change on others

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.480
but done much less of it ourselves.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.816
So it came as an immense shock to me

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.616
when I woke up on the morning of June 24

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.496
to discover that my country
had voted to leave the European Union,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.376
my Prime Minister had resigned,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.976
and Scotland was considering a referendum

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.840
that could bring to an end
the very existence of the United Kingdom.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.856
So that was an immense shock for me,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.160
and it was an immense
shock for many people,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.536
but it was also something
that, over the following several days,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.296
created a complete political meltdown

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.776
in my country.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.016
There were calls for a second referendum,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.576
almost as if, following a sports match,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.120
we could ask the opposition for a replay.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.336
Everybody was blaming everybody else.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.936
People blamed the Prime Minister

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.136
for calling the referendum
in the first place.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.616
They blamed the leader of the opposition
for not fighting it hard enough.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.896
The young accused the old.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.800
The educated blamed
the less well-educated.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.536
That complete meltdown was made even worse

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.656
by the most tragic element of it:

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.536
levels of xenophobia and racist abuse
in the streets of Britain

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.816
at a level that I have never seen before

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.080
in my lifetime.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.176
People are now talking about whether
my country is becoming a Little England,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.296
or, as one of my colleagues put it,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.496
whether we're about to become
a 1950s nostalgia theme park

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.536
floating in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.640
(Laughter)

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.376
But my question is really,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.680
should we have the degree of shock
that we've experienced since?

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.816
Was it something
that took place overnight?

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.336
Or are there deeper structural factors
that have led us to where we are today?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.936
So I want to take a step back
and ask two very basic questions.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.856
First, what does Brexit represent,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.416
not just for my country,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.176
but for all of us around the world?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.376
And second, what can we do about it?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.736
How should we all respond?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.280
So first, what does Brexit represent?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.200
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.896
Brexit teaches us many things
about our society

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.280
and about societies around the world.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.616
It highlights in ways
that we seem embarrassingly unaware of

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.360
how divided our societies are.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.176
The vote split along lines of age,
education, class and geography.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.096
Young people didn't turn out
to vote in great numbers,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.336
but those that did wanted to remain.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.096
Older people really wanted
to leave the European Union.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.616
Geographically, it was London and Scotland
that most strongly committed

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.656
to being part of the European Union,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.800
while in other parts of the country
there was very strong ambivalence.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.376
Those divisions are things we really
need to recognize and take seriously.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.256
But more profoundly,
the vote teaches us something

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.616
about the nature of politics today.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.896
Contemporary politics
is no longer just about right and left.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.656
It's no longer just about tax and spend.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.616
It's about globalization.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.456
The fault line of contemporary politics is
between those that embrace globalization

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.480
and those that fear globalization.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.600
(Applause)

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.336
If we look at why
those who wanted to leave --

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.896
we call them "Leavers,"
as opposed to "Remainers" --

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.136
we see two factors in the opinion polls

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.536
that really mattered.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.896
The first was immigration,
and the second sovereignty,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.376
and these represent a desire for people
to take back control of their own lives

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.280
and the feeling that they
are unrepresented by politicians.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.936
But those ideas are ones
that signify fear and alienation.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.976
They represent a retreat
back towards nationalism and borders

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.079
in ways that many of us would reject.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.816
What I want to suggest is the picture
is more complicated than that,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.376
that liberal internationalists,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.616
like myself, and I firmly
include myself in that picture,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.176
need to write ourselves
back into the picture

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.280
in order to understand
how we've got to where we are today.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.296
When we look at the voting patterns
across the United Kingdom,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.520
we can visibly see the divisions.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.576
The blue areas show Remain

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.696
and the red areas Leave.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.976
When I looked at this,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.856
what personally struck me
was the very little time in my life

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.096
I've actually spent
in many of the red areas.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.256
I suddenly realized that,
looking at the top 50 areas in the UK

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.136
that have the strongest Leave vote,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.560
I've spent a combined total
of four days of my life in those areas.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.056
In some of those places,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.656
I didn't even know the names
of the voting districts.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.536
It was a real shock to me,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.616
and it suggested that people like me

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.736
who think of ourselves
as inclusive, open and tolerant,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.456
perhaps don't know
our own countries and societies

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.096
nearly as well as we like to believe.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.000
(Applause)

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.976
And the challenge that comes from that
is we need to find a new way

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.096
to narrate globalization to those people,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.496
to recognize that for those people who
have not necessarily been to university,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.936
who haven't necessarily
grown up with the Internet,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.976
that don't get opportunities to travel,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.856
they may be unpersuaded
by the narrative that we find persuasive

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.080
in our often liberal bubbles.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.040
(Applause)

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.496
It means that we need to reach out
more broadly and understand.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.536
In the Leave vote, a minority have peddled
the politics of fear and hatred,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.056
creating lies and mistrust

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.016
around, for instance,
the idea that the vote on Europe

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.176
could reduce the number of refugees
and asylum-seekers coming to Europe,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.456
when the vote on leaving
had nothing to do with immigration

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.440
from outside the European Union.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.656
But for a significant majority
of the Leave voters

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.336
the concern was disillusionment
with the political establishment.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.536
This was a protest vote for many,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.016
a sense that nobody represented them,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.456
that they couldn't find
a political party that spoke for them,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.720
and so they rejected
that political establishment.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.496
This replicates around Europe
and much of the liberal democratic world.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.416
We see it with the rise in popularity
of Donald Trump in the United States,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.496
with the growing nationalism
of Viktor OrbÃ¡n in Hungary,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.216
with the increase in popularity
of Marine Le Pen in France.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.120
The specter of Brexit
is in all of our societies.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.096
So the question I think we need to ask
is my second question,

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.640
which is how should we
collectively respond?

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.256
For all of us who care about creating
liberal, open, tolerant societies,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.936
we urgently need a new vision,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.656
a vision of a more tolerant,
inclusive globalization,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.480
one that brings people with us
rather than leaving them behind.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.576
That vision of globalization

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.416
is one that has to start by a recognition
of the positive benefits of globalization.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.016
The consensus amongst economists

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.816
is that free trade,
the movement of capital,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.776
the movement of people across borders

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.536
benefit everyone on aggregate.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.256
The consensus amongst
international relations scholars

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.896
is that globalization
brings interdependence,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.856
which brings cooperation and peace.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.336
But globalization
also has redistributive effects.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.096
It creates winners and losers.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.256
To take the example of migration,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.936
we know that immigration is a net positive
for the economy as a whole

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.480
under almost all circumstances.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.136
But we also have to be very aware

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.216
that there are
redistributive consequences,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.696
that importantly, low-skilled immigration

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.135
can lead to a reduction in wages
for the most impoverished in our societies

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.296
and also put pressure on house prices.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.856
That doesn't detract
from the fact that it's positive,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.775
but it means more people
have to share in those benefits

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.080
and recognize them.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.096
In 2002, the former Secretary-General
of the United Nations, Kofi Annan,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.016
gave a speech at Yale University,

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.016
and that speech was on the topic
of inclusive globalization.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.096
That was the speech
in which he coined that term.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.896
And he said, and I paraphrase,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.256
"The glass house of globalization
has to be open to all

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.840
if it is to remain secure.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.536
Bigotry and ignorance

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:19.136
are the ugly face of exclusionary
and antagonistic globalization."

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.336
That idea of inclusive globalization
was briefly revived in 2008

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.936
in a conference on progressive governance

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.400
involving many of the leaders
of European countries.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.136
But amid austerity
and the financial crisis of 2008,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.256
the concept disappeared
almost without a trace.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.736
Globalization has been taken
to support a neoliberal agenda.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.696
It's perceived to be
part of an elite agenda

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.296
rather than something that benefits all.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.936
And it needs to be reclaimed
on a far more inclusive basis

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.160
than it is today.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.456
So the question is,
how can we achieve that goal?

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.216
How can we balance on the one hand
addressing fear and alienation

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.656
while on the other hand
refusing vehemently

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.456
to give in to xenophobia and nationalism?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.616
That is the question for all of us.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.456
And I think, as a social scientist,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.280
that social science
offers some places to start.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.216
Our transformation has to be about
both ideas and about material change,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.856
and I want to give you four ideas
as a starting point.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.416
The first relates to the idea
of civic education.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.216
What stands out from Brexit

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.296
is the gap between public perception
and empirical reality.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.016
It's been suggested that we've moved
to a postfactual society,

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.696
where evidence and truth no longer matter,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.816
and lies have equal status
to the clarity of evidence.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.096
So how can we --

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.816
(Applause)

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:56.016
How can we rebuild respect for truth
and evidence into our liberal democracies?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.976
It has to begin with education,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.320
but it has to start with the recognition
that there are huge gaps.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.616
In 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.936
published a survey
on attitudes to immigration,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.976
and it showed that as numbers
of immigrants increase,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.216
so public concern
with immigration also increases,

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.656
although it obviously
didn't unpack causality,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.816
because this could equally be to do
not so much with numbers

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.240
but the political
and media narrative around it.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.576
But the same survey also revealed

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.736
huge public misinformation

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.496
and misunderstanding
about the nature of immigration.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.736
For example, in these attitudes
in the United Kingdom,

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.496
the public believed that levels of asylum

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.936
were a greater proportion
of immigration than they were,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.416
but they also believed
the levels of educational migration

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.536
were far lower as a proportion
of overall migration

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.056
than they actually are.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.736
So we have to address this misinformation,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.256
the gap between perception and reality
on key aspects of globalization.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.096
And that can't just be something
that's left to our schools,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.536
although that's important
to begin at an early age.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.616
It has to be about lifelong
civic participation

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.800
and public engagement
that we all encourage as societies.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.776
The second thing
that I think is an opportunity

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.416
is the idea to encourage more interaction
across diverse communities.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.040
(Applause)

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.736
One of the things that stands out
for me very strikingly,

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.616
looking at immigration attitudes
in the United Kingdom,

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.416
is that ironically,
the regions of my country

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.345
that are the most tolerant of immigrants

00:12:36.369 --> 00:12:39.136
have the highest numbers of immigrants.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.496
So for instance, London and the Southeast
have the highest numbers of immigrants,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.656
and they are also by far
the most tolerant areas.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.296
It's those areas of the country
that have the lowest levels of immigration

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.840
that actually are the most exclusionary
and intolerant towards migrants.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.736
So we need to encourage exchange programs.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.216
We need to ensure that older generations
who maybe can't travel

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.376
get access to the Internet.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.096
We need to encourage,
even on a local and national level,

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.976
more movement, more participation,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.696
more interaction
with people who we don't know

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.640
and whose views we might
not necessarily agree with.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.216
The third thing that I think
is crucial, though,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.016
and this is really fundamental,

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.336
is we have to ensure that everybody shares

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.600
in the benefits of globalization.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.256
This illustration from the Financial Times
post-Brexit is really striking.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.016
It shows tragically that those people
who voted to leave the European Union

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.856
were those who actually
benefited the most materially

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.400
from trade with the European Union.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.616
But the problem is
that those people in those areas

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.296
didn't perceive themselves
to be beneficiaries.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.096
They didn't believe that they
were actually getting access

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.840
to material benefits of increased trade
and increased mobility around the world.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.576
I work on questions
predominantly to do with refugees,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.256
and one of the ideas
I spent a lot of my time preaching,

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.056
mainly to developing countries
around the world,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.656
is that in order to encourage
the integration of refugees,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.016
we can't just benefit
the refugee populations,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.080
we also have to address the concerns
of the host communities in local areas.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.816
But in looking at that,

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.856
one of the policy prescriptions
is that we have to provide

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.496
disproportionately better
education facilities, health facilities,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.296
access to social services

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.576
in those regions of high immigration

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.416
to address the concerns
of those local populations.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.096
But while we encourage that
around the developing world,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.696
we don't take those lessons home

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.560
and incorporate them in our own societies.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.536
Furthermore, if we're going
to really take seriously

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.896
the need to ensure people share
in the economic benefits,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.576
our businesses and corporations
need a model of globalization

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.200
that recognizes that they, too,
have to take people with them.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.496
The fourth and final idea
I want to put forward

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.400
is an idea that we need
more responsible politics.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.216
There's very little
social science evidence

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.056
that compares attitudes on globalization.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.616
But from the surveys that do exist,

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.376
what we can see is there's huge variation
across different countries

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.696
and time periods in those countries

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.096
for attitudes and tolerance

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.816
of questions like migration
and mobility on the one hand

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.896
and free trade on the other.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:28.176
But one hypothesis that I think emerges
from a cursory look at that data

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:34.296
is the idea that polarized societies
are far less tolerant of globalization.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.136
It's the societies
like Sweden in the past,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.576
like Canada today,

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.416
where there is a centrist politics,

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.496
where right and left work together,

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.536
that we encourage supportive attitudes
towards globalization.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.376
And what we see around the world today
is a tragic polarization,

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.416
a failure to have dialogue
between the extremes in politics,

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.216
and a gap in terms
of that liberal center ground

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.056
that can encourage communication
and a shared understanding.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.696
We might not achieve that today,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.536
but at the very least we have to call
upon our politicians and our media

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.336
to drop a language of fear
and be far more tolerant of one another.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.240
(Applause)

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.576
These ideas are very tentative,

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.000
and that's in part because this needs
to be an inclusive and shared project.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.400
I am still British.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.080
I am still European.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.640
I am still a global citizen.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.216
For those of us who believe

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.336
that our identities
are not mutually exclusive,

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.376
we have to all work together

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.096
to ensure that globalization
takes everyone with us

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.336
and doesn't leave people behind.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.936
Only then will we truly reconcile
democracy and globalization.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.176
Thank you.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:09.480
(Applause)
