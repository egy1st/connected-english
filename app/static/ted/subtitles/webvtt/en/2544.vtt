WEBVTT

00:00:01.587 --> 00:00:04.619
Two hundred years of modern science.

00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:06.829
We have to admit

00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:08.518
that our performance is not great.

00:00:08.995 --> 00:00:12.331
The machines we build continue
to suffer from mechanical failures.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.767
The houses we build
do not survive severe earthquakes.

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:20.764
But we shouldn't be so critical
of our scientists for a simple reason:

00:00:21.817 --> 00:00:23.272
they didn't have much time.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.400
Two hundred years is not a lot of time,

00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:29.647
while nature had three billion years

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.273
to perfect some of the most
amazing materials,

00:00:33.297 --> 00:00:35.434
that we wish we had in our possession.

00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:40.902
Remember, these materials
carry a quality assurance

00:00:40.926 --> 00:00:42.810
of three billion years.

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:45.525
Take, for example, sequoia trees.

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.696
They carry hundreds of tons
for hundreds of years

00:00:50.243 --> 00:00:53.161
in cold weather, in warm climates,

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:54.528
UV light.

00:00:54.552 --> 00:00:59.125
Yet, if you look at the structure
by high-resolution electron microscopy,

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.172
and you ask yourself, what is it made of,

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:04.968
surprisingly, it's made of sugar.

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:07.801
Well, not exactly as we drink in our tea.

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:11.736
It's actually a nanofiber
called nanocrystalline cellulose.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.725
And this nanocrystalline cellulose
is so strong, on a weight basis,

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:21.068
it's about 10 times stronger than steel.

00:01:21.092 --> 00:01:22.846
Yet it's made of sugar.

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:27.362
So scientists all over the world
believe that nanocellulose

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:31.598
is going to be one of the most important
materials for the entire industry.

00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:33.772
But here's the problem:

00:01:33.796 --> 00:01:36.797
say you want to buy
a half a ton of nanocellulose

00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:38.440
to build a boat or an airplane.

00:01:38.852 --> 00:01:42.392
Well, you can Google, you can eBay,
you can even Alibaba.

00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:44.707
You won't find it.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.795
Of course, you're going to find
thousands of scientific papers --

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.636
great papers, where scientists
are going to say this is a great material,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.764
there are lots of things
we can do with it.

00:01:55.788 --> 00:01:57.292
But no commercial source.

00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:02.974
So we at the Hebrew University,
together with our partners in Sweden,

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:08.649
decided to focus on the development
of an industrial-scale process

00:02:08.673 --> 00:02:10.347
to produce this nanocellulose.

00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:13.595
And, of course,
we didn't want to cut trees.

00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:16.950
So we were looking for another source

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:18.326
of raw material,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.966
and we found one -- in fact,
the sludge of the paper industry.

00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:25.582
The reason: there is a lot of it.

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.969
Europe alone produces 11 million tons

00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:31.534
of that material annually.

00:02:32.447 --> 00:02:37.054
It's the equivalent of a mountain
three kilometers high,

00:02:37.078 --> 00:02:38.509
sitting on a soccer field.

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.263
And we produce this mountain every year.

00:02:41.693 --> 00:02:45.170
So for everybody,
it's an environmental problem,

00:02:45.194 --> 00:02:47.470
and for us, it's a gold mine.

00:02:48.923 --> 00:02:53.085
So now, we are actually producing,
on an industrial scale in Israel,

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.660
nanocellulose, and very soon, in Sweden.

00:02:55.684 --> 00:02:57.834
We can do a lot of things
with the material.

00:02:57.858 --> 00:02:59.233
For example,

00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:03.092
we have shown that by adding
only a small percent of nanocellulose

00:03:03.677 --> 00:03:06.913
into cotton fibers, the same
as my shirt is made of,

00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:09.786
it increases its strength dramatically.

00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:15.142
So this can be used
for making amazing things,

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:20.466
like super-fabrics for industrial
and medical applications.

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.913
But this is not the only thing.

00:03:22.937 --> 00:03:26.791
For example, self-standing,
self-supporting structures,

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:29.411
like the shelters that you can see now,

00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:34.234
actually are now showcasing
in the Venice Biennale for Architecture.

00:03:36.702 --> 00:03:39.875
Nature actually didn't stop its wonders

00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:42.001
in the plant kingdom.

00:03:43.144 --> 00:03:44.491
Think about insects.

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:46.086
Cat fleas, for example,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.950
have the ability to jump
about a hundred times their height.

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:52.319
That's amazing.

00:03:52.343 --> 00:03:54.939
It's the equivalent of a person

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:58.406
standing in the middle
of Liberty Island in New York,

00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:00.588
and in a single jump,

00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:03.492
going to the top of the Statue of Liberty.

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:07.212
I'm sure everybody would like to do that.

00:04:07.236 --> 00:04:08.535
So the question is:

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:10.520
How do cat fleas do it?

00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:14.211
It turns out, they make
this wonderful material,

00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:15.961
which is called resilin.

00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:19.376
In simple words, resilin,
which is a protein,

00:04:20.104 --> 00:04:24.145
is the most elastic rubber on Earth.

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.733
You can stretch it,

00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:29.384
you can squish it,

00:04:29.408 --> 00:04:32.699
and it doesn't lose almost any energy
to the environment.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.532
When you release it -- snap!

00:04:35.556 --> 00:04:37.181
It brings back all the energy.

00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:41.092
So I'm sure everybody
would like to have that material.

00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:42.488
But here's the problem:

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.418
to catch cat fleas is difficult.

00:04:45.442 --> 00:04:47.384
(Laughter)

00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:49.245
Why? Because they are jumpy.

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:50.790
(Laughter)

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:55.748
But now, it's actually
enough to catch one.

00:04:56.653 --> 00:04:58.749
Now we can extract its DNA

00:04:58.773 --> 00:05:01.881
and read how cat fleas make the resilin,

00:05:01.905 --> 00:05:06.628
and clone it into a less-jumpy
organism like a plant.

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.354
So that's exactly what we did.

00:05:09.378 --> 00:05:12.684
Now we have the ability
to produce lots of resilin.

00:05:13.348 --> 00:05:17.097
Well, my team decided to do something
really cool at the university.

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:19.078
They decided to combine

00:05:19.102 --> 00:05:22.324
the strongest material
produced by the plant kingdom

00:05:22.348 --> 00:05:26.129
with the most elastic material
produced by the insect kingdom --

00:05:26.902 --> 00:05:28.780
nanocellulose with resilin.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.829
And the result is amazing.

00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:37.184
This material, in fact, is tough,
elastic and transparent.

00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:41.422
So there are lots of things
that can be done with this material.

00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:43.596
For example, next-generation sport shoes,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.407
so we can jump higher, run faster.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.385
And even touch screens
for computers and smartphones,

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:52.783
that won't break.

00:05:52.807 --> 00:05:56.791
Well, the problem is,
we continue to implant

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.903
synthetic implants in our body,

00:05:58.927 --> 00:06:01.673
which we glue and screw into our body.

00:06:02.514 --> 00:06:04.861
And I'm going to say
that this is not a good idea.

00:06:04.885 --> 00:06:06.796
Why? Because they fail.

00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:08.559
This synthetic material fails,

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:10.632
just like this plastic fork,

00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:13.798
that is not strong enough
for its performance.

00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:16.149
But sometimes they are too strong,

00:06:16.173 --> 00:06:19.244
and therefore their mechanical
properties do not really fit

00:06:19.268 --> 00:06:20.758
their surrounding tissues.

00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:24.229
But in fact, the reason
is much more fundamental.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.509
The reason is that in nature,

00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:29.412
there is no one there

00:06:29.436 --> 00:06:33.092
that actually takes my head
and screws it onto my neck,

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:36.401
or takes my skin
and glues it onto my body.

00:06:37.413 --> 00:06:39.822
In nature, everything is self-assembled.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.470
So every living cell,

00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:47.128
whether coming from a plant,
insect or human being,

00:06:47.152 --> 00:06:51.235
has a DNA that encodes
for nanobio building blocks.

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:52.808
Many times they are proteins.

00:06:53.318 --> 00:06:56.949
Other times, they are enzymes
that make other materials,

00:06:56.973 --> 00:06:59.060
like polysaccharides, fatty acids.

00:06:59.783 --> 00:07:02.427
And the common feature
about all these materials

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:04.883
is that they need no one.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.606
They recognize each other
and self-assemble

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.529
into structures -- scaffolds
on which cells are proliferating

00:07:13.553 --> 00:07:14.993
to give tissues.

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:18.204
They develop into organs,
and together bring life.

00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:25.056
So we at the Hebrew University,
about 10 years ago, decided to focus

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.058
on probably the most important
biomaterial for humans,

00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:32.291
which is collagen.

00:07:33.142 --> 00:07:34.332
Why collagen?

00:07:34.356 --> 00:07:38.070
Because collagen accounts for
about 25 percent of our dry weight.

00:07:38.094 --> 00:07:41.698
We have nothing more than collagen,
other than water, in our body.

00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:44.584
So I always like to say,

00:07:44.608 --> 00:07:47.703
anyone who is in the replacement
parts of human beings

00:07:47.727 --> 00:07:49.161
would like to have collagen.

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:52.687
Admittedly, before we started our project,

00:07:52.711 --> 00:07:56.354
there were already more
than 1,000 medical implants

00:07:56.378 --> 00:07:57.780
made of collagen.

00:07:57.804 --> 00:08:01.660
You know, simple things like
dermal fillers to reduce wrinkles,

00:08:01.684 --> 00:08:03.063
augment lips,

00:08:03.087 --> 00:08:07.356
and other, more sophisticated
medical implants, like heart valves.

00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:09.306
So where is the problem?

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:11.806
Well, the problem is the source.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.655
The source of all that collagen

00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:17.621
is actually coming from dead bodies:

00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:19.755
dead pigs, dead cows

00:08:20.548 --> 00:08:21.858
and even human cadavers.

00:08:22.342 --> 00:08:24.582
So safety is a big issue.

00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:27.185
But it's not the only one.

00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:29.003
Also, the quality.

00:08:29.756 --> 00:08:32.010
Now here, I have a personal interest.

00:08:32.415 --> 00:08:35.208
This is my father, Zvi,
in our winery in Israel.

00:08:35.792 --> 00:08:38.954
A heart valve, very similar
to the one that I showed you before,

00:08:39.668 --> 00:08:42.751
seven years ago,
was implanted in his body.

00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:49.077
Now, the scientific literature says
that these heart valves start to fail

00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:51.144
10 years after the operation.

00:08:52.446 --> 00:08:53.660
No wonder:

00:08:54.295 --> 00:08:57.791
they are made from old, used tissues,

00:08:58.426 --> 00:09:02.156
just like this wall made of bricks
that is falling apart.

00:09:02.778 --> 00:09:06.219
Yeah, of course, I can take
those bricks and build a new wall.

00:09:06.749 --> 00:09:08.646
But it's not going to be the same.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.132
So the US Food and Drug Administration

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.275
made a notice already in 2007,

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:19.346
asking the companies to start to look
for better alternatives.

00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:21.938
So that's exactly what we did.

00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:27.534
We decided to clone all the five
human genes responsible

00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:30.783
for making type I collagen in humans

00:09:31.506 --> 00:09:34.926
into a transgenic tobacco plant.

00:09:35.462 --> 00:09:41.224
So now, the plant has the ability
to make human collagen brand new,

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:42.404
untouched.

00:09:42.428 --> 00:09:43.661
This is amazing.

00:09:44.409 --> 00:09:46.176
Actually, it's happening now.

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:52.015
Today in Israel, we grow it
in 25,000 square meters of greenhouses

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:53.284
all over the country.

00:09:53.689 --> 00:09:56.517
The farmers receive
small plantlets of tobacco.

00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:58.491
It looks exactly like regular tobacco,

00:09:58.896 --> 00:10:01.046
except that they have five human genes.

00:10:01.459 --> 00:10:03.771
They're responsible for making
type I collagen.

00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:07.620
We grow them for about 50 to 70 days,

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:09.850
we harvest the leaves,

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.405
and then the leaves are transported
by cooling trucks to the factory.

00:10:14.809 --> 00:10:18.040
There, the process of extracting
the collagen starts.

00:10:18.555 --> 00:10:22.042
Now, if you ever made a pesto --
essentially, the same thing.

00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:23.582
(Laughter)

00:10:24.198 --> 00:10:28.387
You crush the leaves, you get
the juice that contains the collagen.

00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:30.305
We concentrate the protein,

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:33.596
transfer the protein to clean rooms
for the final purification,

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.940
and the end result is a collagen
identical to what we have in our body --

00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:41.655
untouched, brand new

00:10:42.201 --> 00:10:44.737
and from which we make
different medical implants:

00:10:45.656 --> 00:10:48.111
bone void fillers, for example,

00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:52.433
for severe bone fractures, spinal fusion.

00:10:53.068 --> 00:10:54.633
And more recently, even,

00:10:54.657 --> 00:10:59.029
we've been able to launch
into the market here in Europe

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.133
a flowable gel that is used
for diabetic foot ulcers,

00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:05.794
that is now approved
for use in the clinic.

00:11:06.823 --> 00:11:08.351
This is not science fiction.

00:11:08.716 --> 00:11:10.367
This is happening now.

00:11:10.391 --> 00:11:14.937
We are using plants
to make medical implants

00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:16.969
for replacement parts for human beings.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.071
In fact, more recently,
we've been able to make collagen fibers

00:11:22.095 --> 00:11:25.392
which are six times stronger
than the Achilles tendon.

00:11:25.796 --> 00:11:27.117
That's amazing.

00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:30.023
Together with our partners from Ireland,

00:11:30.047 --> 00:11:31.762
we thought about the next thing:

00:11:32.112 --> 00:11:34.358
adding resilin to those fibers.

00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:36.608
By doing that,

00:11:36.632 --> 00:11:39.430
we've been able to make a superfiber

00:11:39.454 --> 00:11:42.428
which is about 380 percent tougher,

00:11:42.775 --> 00:11:45.487
and 300 percent more elastic.

00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:48.591
So oddly enough, in the future,

00:11:48.615 --> 00:11:53.575
when a patient is transplanted
with artificial tendons or ligaments

00:11:53.599 --> 00:11:55.329
made from these fibers,

00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:58.932
we'll have better performance
after the surgery

00:11:58.956 --> 00:12:00.685
than we had before the injury.

00:12:01.642 --> 00:12:03.367
So what's for the future?

00:12:03.391 --> 00:12:06.392
In the future, we believe
we'll be able to make

00:12:06.416 --> 00:12:09.993
many nanobio building blocks
that nature provided for us --

00:12:10.017 --> 00:12:13.857
collagen, nanocellulose,
resilin and many more.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:18.073
And that will enable us to make
better machines perform better,

00:12:18.097 --> 00:12:19.279
even the heart.

00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:22.097
Now, this heart
is not going to be the same

00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:24.263
as we can get from a donor.

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:26.286
It will be better.

00:12:26.834 --> 00:12:28.866
It actually will perform better

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.191
and will last longer.

00:12:30.945 --> 00:12:33.390
My friend Zion Suliman once told me

00:12:33.414 --> 00:12:35.627
a smart sentence.

00:12:36.301 --> 00:12:39.338
He said, "If you want a new idea,

00:12:39.362 --> 00:12:40.991
you should open an old book."

00:12:41.431 --> 00:12:44.933
And I'm going to say
that the book was written.

00:12:45.815 --> 00:12:47.956
It was written over three billion years

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.137
of evolution.

00:12:49.566 --> 00:12:52.621
And the text is the DNA of life.

00:12:53.923 --> 00:12:55.137
All we have to do

00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:57.196
is read this text,

00:12:58.156 --> 00:13:00.713
embrace nature's gift to us

00:13:00.737 --> 00:13:02.725
and start our progress from here.

00:13:03.252 --> 00:13:04.413
Thank you.

00:13:04.437 --> 00:13:08.317
(Applause)
