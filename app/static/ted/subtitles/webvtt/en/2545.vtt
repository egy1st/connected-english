WEBVTT

00:00:00.943 --> 00:00:02.364
I'm really glad to be here.

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:04.703
I'm glad you're here,

00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:06.560
because that would be a little weird.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.565
I'm glad we're all here.

00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:13.156
And by "here," I don't mean here.

00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:15.981
Or here.

00:00:16.728 --> 00:00:17.880
But here.

00:00:17.904 --> 00:00:19.054
I mean Earth.

00:00:19.627 --> 00:00:23.570
And by "we," I don't mean
those of us in this auditorium,

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:25.064
but life,

00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:26.537
all life on Earth --

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:31.943
(Laughter)

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.271
from complex to single-celled,

00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:36.619
from mold to mushrooms

00:00:36.643 --> 00:00:38.021
to flying bears.

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:39.411
(Laughter)

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:43.245
The interesting thing is,

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.300
Earth is the only place
we know of that has life --

00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:48.201
8.7 million species.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.914
We've looked other places,

00:00:49.938 --> 00:00:52.035
maybe not as hard
as we should or we could,

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.986
but we've looked and haven't found any;

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.286
Earth is the only place
we know of with life.

00:00:57.318 --> 00:00:58.592
Is Earth special?

00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:02.045
This is a question I've wanted
to know the answer to

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:03.323
since I was a small child,

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:05.379
and I suspect 80 percent
of this auditorium

00:01:05.403 --> 00:01:08.411
has thought the same thing
and also wanted to know the answer.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.046
To understand whether
there are any planets --

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.348
out there in our solar system or beyond --

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:14.830
that can support life,

00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:18.051
the first step is to understand
what life here requires.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:22.138
It turns out, of all of those
8.7 million species,

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:24.360
life only needs three things.

00:01:25.032 --> 00:01:27.884
On one side, all life
on Earth needs energy.

00:01:27.908 --> 00:01:31.393
Complex life like us derives
our energy from the sun,

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:33.518
but life deep underground
can get its energy

00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:35.264
from things like chemical reactions.

00:01:35.288 --> 00:01:37.439
There are a number
of different energy sources

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:38.706
available on all planets.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.556
On the other side,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.285
all life needs food or nourishment.

00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:48.215
And this seems like a tall order,
especially if you want a succulent tomato.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:49.955
(Laughter)

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.045
However, all life on Earth
derives its nourishment

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.099
from only six chemical elements,

00:01:55.123 --> 00:01:58.127
and these elements can be found
on any planetary body

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.487
in our solar system.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:03.764
So that leaves the thing
in the middle as the tall pole,

00:02:03.788 --> 00:02:05.742
the thing that's hardest to achieve.

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:07.658
Not moose, but water.

00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:10.463
(Laughter)

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:13.079
Although moose would be pretty cool.

00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:14.261
(Laughter)

00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:19.820
And not frozen water, and not water
in a gaseous state, but liquid water.

00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:23.201
This is what life needs
to survive, all life.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.016
And many solar system bodies
don't have liquid water,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.676
and so we don't look there.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.693
Other solar system bodies
might have abundant liquid water,

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:33.052
even more than Earth,

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:35.526
but it's trapped beneath an icy shell,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.811
and so it's hard to access,
it's hard to get to,

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:40.554
it's hard to even find out
if there's any life there.

00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:44.470
So that leaves a few bodies
that we should think about.

00:02:44.494 --> 00:02:46.923
So let's make the problem
simpler for ourselves.

00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:50.288
Let's think only about liquid water
on the surface of a planet.

00:02:50.312 --> 00:02:53.268
There are only three bodies
to think about in our solar system,

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:55.874
with regard to liquid water
on the surface of a planet,

00:02:55.898 --> 00:03:00.724
and in order of distance from the sun,
it's: Venus, Earth and Mars.

00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:04.637
You want to have an atmosphere
for water to be liquid.

00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:07.039
You have to be very careful
with that atmosphere.

00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:10.475
You can't have too much atmosphere,
too thick or too warm an atmosphere,

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.404
because then you end up
too hot like Venus,

00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:15.165
and you can't have liquid water.

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.142
But if you have too little atmosphere
and it's too thin and too cold,

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:21.190
you end up like Mars, too cold.

00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:24.340
So Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold,

00:03:24.364 --> 00:03:25.528
and Earth is just right.

00:03:25.552 --> 00:03:29.027
You can look at these images behind me
and you can see automatically

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.648
where life can survive
in our solar system.

00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:33.896
It's a Goldilocks-type problem,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.410
and it's so simple
that a child could understand it.

00:03:37.452 --> 00:03:38.632
However,

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.378
I'd like to remind you of two things

00:03:42.402 --> 00:03:45.356
from the Goldilocks story
that we may not think about so often

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.476
but that I think are really relevant here.

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:49.206
Number one:

00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:53.103
if Mama Bear's bowl is too cold

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.841
when Goldilocks walks into the room,

00:03:56.642 --> 00:03:58.785
does that mean it's always been too cold?

00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:03.093
Or could it have been just right
at some other time?

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.331
When Goldilocks walks into the room
determines the answer

00:04:07.355 --> 00:04:08.687
that we get in the story.

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:10.844
And the same is true with planets.

00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:12.894
They're not static things. They change.

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:14.660
They vary. They evolve.

00:04:14.684 --> 00:04:16.727
And atmospheres do the same.

00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:18.453
So let me give you an example.

00:04:18.477 --> 00:04:20.479
Here's one of my favorite
pictures of Mars.

00:04:20.503 --> 00:04:23.634
It's not the highest resolution image,
it's not the sexiest image,

00:04:23.658 --> 00:04:25.161
it's not the most recent image,

00:04:25.185 --> 00:04:28.679
but it's an image that shows riverbeds
cut into the surface of the planet;

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.904
riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water;

00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:38.401
riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands
or tens of thousands of years to form.

00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:40.043
This can't happen on Mars today.

00:04:40.067 --> 00:04:42.548
The atmosphere of Mars today
is too thin and too cold

00:04:42.572 --> 00:04:44.713
for water to be stable as a liquid.

00:04:44.737 --> 00:04:49.085
This one image tells you
that the atmosphere of Mars changed,

00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:51.141
and it changed in big ways.

00:04:51.714 --> 00:04:56.523
And it changed from a state
that we would define as habitable,

00:04:56.547 --> 00:05:00.137
because the three requirements
for life were present long ago.

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:03.117
Where did that atmosphere go

00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:05.961
that allowed water
to be liquid at the surface?

00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:09.332
Well, one idea is it escaped
away to space.

00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:12.023
Atmospheric particles
got enough energy to break free

00:05:12.047 --> 00:05:13.700
from the gravity of the planet,

00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:16.413
escaping away to space, never to return.

00:05:16.437 --> 00:05:19.125
And this happens with all bodies
with atmospheres.

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:20.321
Comets have tails

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:23.602
that are incredibly visible reminders
of atmospheric escape.

00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:27.035
But Venus also has an atmosphere
that escapes with time,

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:28.719
and Mars and Earth as well.

00:05:28.743 --> 00:05:31.711
It's just a matter of degree
and a matter of scale.

00:05:32.092 --> 00:05:34.768
So we'd like to figure out
how much escaped over time

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:36.908
so we can explain this transition.

00:05:36.932 --> 00:05:39.543
How do atmospheres
get their energy for escape?

00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:41.698
How do particles get
enough energy to escape?

00:05:41.722 --> 00:05:44.907
There are two ways, if we're going
to reduce things a little bit.

00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:46.082
Number one, sunlight.

00:05:46.106 --> 00:05:49.518
Light emitted from the sun can be absorbed
by atmospheric particles

00:05:49.542 --> 00:05:51.256
and warm the particles.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.388
Yes, I'm dancing, but they --

00:05:53.412 --> 00:05:54.883
(Laughter)

00:05:55.693 --> 00:05:57.605
Oh my God, not even at my wedding.

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.121
(Laughter)

00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:02.148
They get enough energy
to escape and break free

00:06:02.172 --> 00:06:04.672
from the gravity of the planet
just by warming.

00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:07.858
A second way they can get energy
is from the solar wind.

00:06:07.882 --> 00:06:12.908
These are particles, mass, material,
spit out from the surface of the sun,

00:06:12.932 --> 00:06:15.336
and they go screaming
through the solar system

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.145
at 400 kilometers per second,

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.763
sometimes faster during solar storms,

00:06:19.787 --> 00:06:22.509
and they go hurtling
through interplanetary space

00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:24.979
towards planets and their atmospheres,

00:06:25.003 --> 00:06:26.628
and they may provide energy

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:28.780
for atmospheric particles
to escape as well.

00:06:29.182 --> 00:06:31.151
This is something that I'm interested in,

00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:32.888
because it relates to habitability.

00:06:33.378 --> 00:06:36.510
I mentioned that there were two things
about the Goldilocks story

00:06:36.534 --> 00:06:39.518
that I wanted to bring to your attention
and remind you about,

00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:41.781
and the second one
is a little bit more subtle.

00:06:41.805 --> 00:06:44.593
If Papa Bear's bowl is too hot,

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.414
and Mama Bear's bowl is too cold,

00:06:51.057 --> 00:06:54.168
shouldn't Baby Bear's bowl be even colder

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.877
if we're following the trend?

00:06:58.195 --> 00:07:00.507
This thing that you've accepted
your entire life,

00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:03.601
when you think about it a little bit more,
may not be so simple.

00:07:04.513 --> 00:07:08.541
And of course, distance of a planet
from the sun determines its temperature.

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.831
This has to play into habitability.

00:07:10.855 --> 00:07:13.785
But maybe there are other things
we should be thinking about.

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:15.425
Maybe it's the bowls themselves

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.505
that are also helping to determine
the outcome in the story,

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:19.829
what is just right.

00:07:20.765 --> 00:07:23.630
I could talk to you about a lot
of different characteristics

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:24.805
of these three planets

00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:26.398
that may influence habitability,

00:07:26.422 --> 00:07:29.016
but for selfish reasons related
to my own research

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.628
and the fact that I'm standing up here
holding the clicker and you're not --

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:33.658
(Laughter)

00:07:33.682 --> 00:07:35.791
I would like to talk
for just a minute or two

00:07:35.815 --> 00:07:37.112
about magnetic fields.

00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:40.247
Earth has one; Venus and Mars do not.

00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:43.948
Magnetic fields are generated
in the deep interior of a planet

00:07:43.972 --> 00:07:47.689
by electrically conducting
churning fluid material

00:07:47.713 --> 00:07:50.618
that creates this big old magnetic field
that surrounds Earth.

00:07:50.642 --> 00:07:53.038
If you have a compass,
you know which way north is.

00:07:53.062 --> 00:07:54.556
Venus and Mars don't have that.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.494
If you have a compass on Venus and Mars,

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:57.914
congratulations, you're lost.

00:07:57.938 --> 00:07:59.841
(Laughter)

00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:01.905
Does this influence habitability?

00:08:03.175 --> 00:08:04.477
Well, how might it?

00:08:05.024 --> 00:08:07.628
Many scientists think
that a magnetic field of a planet

00:08:07.652 --> 00:08:10.047
serves as a shield for the atmosphere,

00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:13.426
deflecting solar wind particles
around the planet

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.265
in a bit of a force field-type effect

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:17.989
having to do with electric charge
of those particles.

00:08:18.362 --> 00:08:21.989
I like to think of it instead
as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets.

00:08:22.013 --> 00:08:24.292
(Laughter)

00:08:24.962 --> 00:08:28.343
And yes, my colleagues
who watch this later will realize

00:08:28.367 --> 00:08:30.911
this is the first time in the history
of our community

00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:33.214
that the solar wind has been
equated with mucus.

00:08:33.238 --> 00:08:34.888
(Laughter)

00:08:36.978 --> 00:08:40.453
OK, so the effect, then, is that Earth
may have been protected

00:08:40.477 --> 00:08:41.646
for billions of years,

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.520
because we've had a magnetic field.

00:08:43.544 --> 00:08:45.723
Atmosphere hasn't been able to escape.

00:08:45.747 --> 00:08:47.854
Mars, on the other hand,
has been unprotected

00:08:47.878 --> 00:08:49.720
because of its lack of magnetic field,

00:08:49.744 --> 00:08:51.696
and over billions of years,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.900
maybe enough atmosphere
has been stripped away

00:08:53.924 --> 00:08:56.517
to account for a transition
from a habitable planet

00:08:56.541 --> 00:08:58.207
to the planet that we see today.

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:02.048
Other scientists think
that magnetic fields

00:09:02.072 --> 00:09:04.235
may act more like the sails on a ship,

00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:09.995
enabling the planet to interact
with more energy from the solar wind

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:13.291
than the planet would have been able
to interact with by itself.

00:09:13.315 --> 00:09:15.806
The sails may gather energy
from the solar wind.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.496
The magnetic field may gather
energy from the solar wind

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.764
that allows even more
atmospheric escape to happen.

00:09:21.788 --> 00:09:24.042
It's an idea that has to be tested,

00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:25.951
but the effect and how it works

00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:27.126
seems apparent.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.301
That's because we know

00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:31.400
energy from the solar wind
is being deposited into our atmosphere

00:09:31.424 --> 00:09:32.575
here on Earth.

00:09:32.599 --> 00:09:35.004
That energy is conducted
along magnetic field lines

00:09:35.028 --> 00:09:36.376
down into the polar regions,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.536
resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.216
If you've ever experienced them,
it's magnificent.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.246
We know the energy is getting in.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.303
We're trying to measure
how many particles are getting out

00:09:46.327 --> 00:09:49.365
and if the magnetic field
is influencing this in any way.

00:09:50.722 --> 00:09:53.102
So I've posed a problem for you here,

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:54.672
but I don't have a solution yet.

00:09:54.696 --> 00:09:55.972
We don't have a solution.

00:09:56.702 --> 00:09:59.059
But we're working on it.
How are we working on it?

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:01.381
Well, we've sent spacecraft
to all three planets.

00:10:01.405 --> 00:10:02.881
Some of them are orbiting now,

00:10:02.905 --> 00:10:05.977
including the MAVEN spacecraft
which is currently orbiting Mars,

00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:09.533
which I'm involved with
and which is led here,

00:10:09.557 --> 00:10:11.366
out of the University of Colorado.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.672
It's designed to measure
atmospheric escape.

00:10:14.022 --> 00:10:16.496
We have similar measurements
from Venus and Earth.

00:10:16.953 --> 00:10:18.618
Once we have all our measurements,

00:10:18.642 --> 00:10:21.517
we can combine all these together,
and we can understand

00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:24.958
how all three planets interact
with their space environment,

00:10:24.982 --> 00:10:26.144
with the surroundings.

00:10:26.168 --> 00:10:29.690
And we can decide whether magnetic fields
are important for habitability

00:10:29.714 --> 00:10:30.872
or not.

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:33.161
Once we have that answer,
why should you care?

00:10:33.185 --> 00:10:34.485
I mean, I care deeply ...

00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:38.134
And financially as well, but deeply.

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:40.000
(Laughter)

00:10:40.763 --> 00:10:42.681
First of all, an answer to this question

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:44.808
will teach us more
about these three planets,

00:10:44.832 --> 00:10:45.992
Venus, Earth and Mars,

00:10:46.016 --> 00:10:48.927
not only about how they interact
with their environment today,

00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:50.878
but how they were billions of years ago,

00:10:50.902 --> 00:10:52.964
whether they were habitable
long ago or not.

00:10:52.988 --> 00:10:54.632
It will teach us about atmospheres

00:10:54.656 --> 00:10:56.651
that surround us and that are close.

00:10:57.127 --> 00:10:59.311
But moreover, what we learn
from these planets

00:10:59.335 --> 00:11:01.356
can be applied to atmospheres everywhere,

00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:05.398
including planets that we're now
observing around other stars.

00:11:05.422 --> 00:11:07.177
For example, the Kepler spacecraft,

00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:10.409
which is built and controlled
here in Boulder,

00:11:10.433 --> 00:11:13.718
has been observing
a postage stamp-sized region of the sky

00:11:13.742 --> 00:11:14.989
for a couple years now,

00:11:15.013 --> 00:11:17.241
and it's found thousands of planets --

00:11:17.265 --> 00:11:20.178
in one postage stamp-sized
region of the sky

00:11:20.202 --> 00:11:24.291
that we don't think is any different
from any other part of the sky.

00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:26.625
We've gone, in 20 years,

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:30.686
from knowing of zero planets
outside of our solar system,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.463
to now having so many,

00:11:32.487 --> 00:11:35.626
that we don't know
which ones to investigate first.

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:38.729
Any lever will help.

00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:44.123
In fact, based on observations
that Kepler's taken

00:11:44.147 --> 00:11:46.276
and other similar observations,

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.469
we now believe that,

00:11:47.493 --> 00:11:52.192
of the 200 billion stars
in the Milky Way galaxy alone,

00:11:52.786 --> 00:11:57.390
on average, every star
has at least one planet.

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:00.322
In addition to that,

00:12:00.346 --> 00:12:06.047
estimates suggest there are somewhere
between 40 billion and 100 billion

00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:09.403
of those planets
that we would define as habitable

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:12.551
in just our galaxy.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.627
We have the observations of those planets,

00:12:16.651 --> 00:12:19.135
but we just don't know
which ones are habitable yet.

00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:22.765
It's a little bit like
being trapped on a red spot --

00:12:22.789 --> 00:12:23.960
(Laughter)

00:12:23.984 --> 00:12:25.216
on a stage

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:29.740
and knowing that there are
other worlds out there

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.818
and desperately wanting to know
more about them,

00:12:35.174 --> 00:12:39.108
wanting to interrogate them and find out
if maybe just one or two of them

00:12:39.132 --> 00:12:40.742
are a little bit like you.

00:12:42.244 --> 00:12:44.803
You can't do that.
You can't go there, not yet.

00:12:44.827 --> 00:12:48.820
And so you have to use the tools
that you've developed around you

00:12:48.844 --> 00:12:50.139
for Venus, Earth and Mars,

00:12:50.163 --> 00:12:52.976
and you have to apply them
to these other situations,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.696
and hope that you're making
reasonable inferences from the data,

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.838
and that you're going to be able
to determine the best candidates

00:13:00.862 --> 00:13:03.261
for habitable planets,
and those that are not.

00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:06.854
In the end, and for now, at least,

00:13:06.878 --> 00:13:09.665
this is our red spot, right here.

00:13:10.376 --> 00:13:13.712
This is the only planet
that we know of that's habitable,

00:13:13.736 --> 00:13:16.927
although very soon we may
come to know of more.

00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:19.687
But for now, this is
the only habitable planet,

00:13:19.711 --> 00:13:21.013
and this is our red spot.

00:13:21.976 --> 00:13:23.396
I'm really glad we're here.

00:13:24.507 --> 00:13:25.682
Thanks.

00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:28.937
(Applause)
