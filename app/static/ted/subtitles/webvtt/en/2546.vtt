00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:03.125
This is a man-made forest.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.097
It can spread over acres
and acres of area,

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:09.613
or it could fit in a small space --

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:13.125
as small as your house garden.

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:18.546
Age of this forest
is just two years old.

00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:22.413
I have a forest in the backyard
of my own house.

00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:24.985
It attracts a lot of biodiversity.

00:00:25.582 --> 00:00:29.558
(Bird call)

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.774
I wake up to this every morning,

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.297
like a Disney princess.

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:34.718
(Laughter)

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:36.370
I am an entrepreneur

00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:40.774
who facilitates the making
of these forests professionally.

00:00:40.798 --> 00:00:42.722
We have helped factories,

00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:43.903
farms,

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:45.085
schools,

00:00:46.287 --> 00:00:47.442
homes,

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:49.482
resorts,

00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:51.629
apartment buildings,

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:54.131
public parks

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.197
and even a zoo

00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:57.730
to have one of such forests.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:03.009
A forest is not an isolated piece of land
where animals live together.

00:01:04.035 --> 00:01:09.575
A forest can be an integral part
of our urban existence.

00:01:10.212 --> 00:01:11.546
A forest, for me,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.067
is a place so dense with trees
that you just can't walk into it.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.037
It doesn't matter
how big or small they are.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:22.429
Most of the world
we live in today was forest.

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:24.486
This was before human intervention.

00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:27.153
Then we built up our cities
on those forests,

00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:28.677
like SÃ£o Paulo,

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:31.470
forgetting that we belong
to nature as well,

00:01:31.494 --> 00:01:35.244
as much as 8.4 million
other species on the planet.

00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:39.643
Our habitat stopped being
our natural habitat.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.192
But not anymore for some of us.

00:01:42.647 --> 00:01:46.242
A few others and I today make
these forests professionally --

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.073
anywhere and everywhere.

00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:51.234
I'm an industrial engineer.

00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:53.430
I specialize in making cars.

00:01:54.078 --> 00:01:56.254
In my previous job at Toyota,

00:01:56.278 --> 00:02:00.346
I learned how to convert
natural resources into products.

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:02.307
To give you an example,

00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:04.982
we would drip the sap
out of a rubber tree,

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:06.665
convert it into raw rubber

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.394
and make a tire out of it -- the product.

00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:12.412
But these products can never
become a natural resource again.

00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:16.245
We separate the elements from nature

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.505
and convert them
into an irreversible state.

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.246
That's industrial production.

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:25.487
Nature, on the other hand,
works in a totally opposite way.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.895
The natural system produces
by bringing elements together,

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.274
atom by atom.

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:37.051
All the natural products
become a natural resource again.

00:02:38.343 --> 00:02:41.285
This is something which I learned

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.347
when I made a forest
in the backyard of my own house.

00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:47.647
And this was the first time
I worked with nature,

00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:49.137
rather than against it.

00:02:49.894 --> 00:02:51.070
Since then,

00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:56.143
we have made 75 such forests
in 25 cities across the world.

00:02:57.678 --> 00:02:59.800
Every time we work at a new place,

00:02:59.824 --> 00:03:04.568
we find that every single element
needed to make a forest

00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:06.642
is available right around us.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:09.347
All we have to do is to bring
these elements together

00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:11.332
and let nature take over.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.101
To make a forest we start with soil.

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:18.565
We touch, feel and even taste it

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.057
to identify what properties it lacks.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.722
If the soil is made up of small particles
it becomes compact --

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.149
so compact, that water cannot seep in.

00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:32.636
We mix some local biomass
available around,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.187
which can help soil become more porous.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.016
Water can now seep in.

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.858
If the soil doesn't have
the capacity to hold water,

00:03:43.882 --> 00:03:45.557
we will mix some more biomass --

00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:48.855
some water-absorbent material
like peat or bagasse,

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.727
so soil can hold this water
and it stays moist.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.298
To grow, plants need water,
sunlight and nutrition.

00:03:59.047 --> 00:04:01.783
What if the soil doesn't have
any nutrition in it?

00:04:02.383 --> 00:04:04.709
We don't just add nutrition
directly to the soil.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:06.345
That would be the industrial way.

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:07.795
It goes against nature.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.903
We instead add microorganisms to the soil.

00:04:10.927 --> 00:04:14.236
They produce the nutrients
in the soil naturally.

00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:17.475
They feed on the biomass
we have mixed in the soil,

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.198
so all they have to do
is eat and multiply.

00:04:20.222 --> 00:04:22.173
And as their number grows,

00:04:22.197 --> 00:04:23.745
the soil starts breathing again.

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:25.162
It becomes alive.

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:28.842
We survey the native
tree species of the place.

00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:30.947
How do we decide what's native or not?

00:04:31.473 --> 00:04:35.931
Well, whatever existed
before human intervention is native.

00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:37.344
That's the simple rule.

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.794
We survey a national park

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.024
to find the last remains
of a natural forest.

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.690
We survey the sacred groves,

00:04:49.714 --> 00:04:52.605
or sacred forests around old temples.

00:04:52.973 --> 00:04:55.252
And if we don't find anything at all,

00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:56.800
we go to museums

00:04:56.824 --> 00:05:02.047
to see the seeds or wood of trees
existing there a long time ago.

00:05:02.547 --> 00:05:08.044
We research old paintings,
poems and literature from the place,

00:05:08.068 --> 00:05:10.601
to identify the tree species
belonging there.

00:05:11.217 --> 00:05:12.563
Once we know our trees,

00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:14.505
we divide them in four different layers:

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.936
shrub layer, sub-tree layer,
tree layer and canopy layer.

00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:20.992
We fix the ratios of each layer,

00:05:21.016 --> 00:05:25.720
and then we decide the percentage
of each tree species in the mix.

00:05:26.506 --> 00:05:28.339
If we are making a fruit forest,

00:05:28.363 --> 00:05:31.422
we increase the percentage
of fruit-bearing trees.

00:05:31.446 --> 00:05:33.612
It could be a flowering forest,

00:05:34.145 --> 00:05:37.572
a forest that attracts
a lot of birds or bees,

00:05:38.026 --> 00:05:42.085
or it could simply be a native,
wild evergreen forest.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.529
We collect the seeds
and germinate saplings out of them.

00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:49.975
We make sure that trees
belonging to the same layer

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:51.849
are not planted next to each other,

00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:55.200
or they will fight for the same
vertical space when they grow tall.

00:05:55.224 --> 00:05:57.784
We plant the saplings close to each other.

00:05:58.548 --> 00:06:01.613
On the surface, we spread
a thick layer of mulch,

00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:04.205
so when it's hot outside
the soil stays moist.

00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:06.317
When it's cold,

00:06:06.341 --> 00:06:09.558
frost formation happens only on the mulch,

00:06:09.582 --> 00:06:12.991
so soil can still breathe
while it's freezing outside.

00:06:13.497 --> 00:06:16.666
The soil is very soft --

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.184
so soft, that roots
can penetrate into it easily,

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:21.358
rapidly.

00:06:22.064 --> 00:06:24.549
Initially, the forest doesn't
seem like it's growing,

00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:26.391
but it's growing under the surface.

00:06:26.746 --> 00:06:28.207
In the first three months,

00:06:28.231 --> 00:06:30.158
roots reach a depth of one meter.

00:06:30.736 --> 00:06:32.620
These roots form a mesh,

00:06:32.644 --> 00:06:34.373
tightly holding the soil.

00:06:34.397 --> 00:06:37.993
Microbes and fungi live
throughout this network of roots.

00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:42.293
So if some nutrition is not available
in the vicinity of a tree,

00:06:42.317 --> 00:06:45.177
these microbes are going to get
the nutrition to the tree.

00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:47.478
Whenever it rains,

00:06:47.502 --> 00:06:48.662
magically,

00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:50.549
mushrooms appear overnight.

00:06:50.573 --> 00:06:53.778
And this means the soil below
has a healthy fungal network.

00:06:54.663 --> 00:06:56.930
Once these roots are established,

00:06:56.954 --> 00:06:59.119
forest starts growing on the surface.

00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:04.202
As the forest grows we keep watering it --

00:07:04.226 --> 00:07:08.017
for the next two to three years,
we water the forest.

00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:13.808
We want to keep all the water
and soil nutrition only for our trees,

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:16.516
so we remove the weeds
growing on the ground.

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:20.289
As this forest grows,
it blocks the sunlight.

00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:23.247
Eventually, the forest becomes so dense

00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:25.505
that sunlight can't reach
the ground anymore.

00:07:25.902 --> 00:07:29.364
Weeds cannot grow now,
because they need sunlight as well.

00:07:30.044 --> 00:07:31.323
At this stage,

00:07:31.347 --> 00:07:34.544
every single drop of water
that falls into the forest

00:07:34.568 --> 00:07:36.925
doesn't evaporate back
into the atmosphere.

00:07:37.327 --> 00:07:40.415
This dense forest condenses the moist air

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:42.210
and retains its moisture.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:46.865
We gradually reduce and eventually
stop watering the forest.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.858
And even without watering,

00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:52.928
the forest floor stays moist
and sometimes even dark.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.370
Now, when a single leaf
falls on this forest floor,

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.545
it immediately starts decaying.

00:08:00.317 --> 00:08:03.503
This decayed biomass forms humus,

00:08:03.527 --> 00:08:05.029
which is food for the forest.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.209
As the forest grows,

00:08:07.233 --> 00:08:08.903
more leaves fall on the surface --

00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:10.959
it means more humus is produced,

00:08:10.983 --> 00:08:14.221
it means more food so the forest
can grow still bigger.

00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:16.978
And this forest keeps
growing exponentially.

00:08:18.053 --> 00:08:19.469
Once established,

00:08:19.493 --> 00:08:23.683
these forests are going to regenerate
themselves again and again --

00:08:23.707 --> 00:08:25.281
probably forever.

00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:28.655
In a natural forest like this,

00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:31.350
no management is the best management.

00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:34.284
It's a tiny jungle party.

00:08:34.308 --> 00:08:35.523
(Laughter)

00:08:36.663 --> 00:08:39.206
This forest grows as a collective.

00:08:39.627 --> 00:08:40.945
If the same trees --

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:42.246
same species --

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.508
would have been planted independently,

00:08:44.532 --> 00:08:46.479
it wouldn't grow so fast.

00:08:46.503 --> 00:08:50.687
And this is how we create
a 100-year-old forest

00:08:50.711 --> 00:08:52.020
in just 10 years.

00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:53.198
Thank you very much.

00:08:53.222 --> 00:08:58.796
(Applause)
