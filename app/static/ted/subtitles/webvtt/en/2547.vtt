WEBVTT

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.800
"Mom, who are these people?"

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.096
It was an innocent question
from my young daughter Alia

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.256
around the time when she was three.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.376
We were walking along with my husband

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.176
in one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.496
Alia was peering at a huge poster
standing tall in the middle of the mall.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880
It featured the three rulers
of the United Arab Emirates.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.216
As she tucked in my side,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.456
I bent down and explained
that these were the rulers of the UAE

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.736
who had worked hard
to develop their nation

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.000
and preserve its unity.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.896
She asked, "Mom, why is it
that here where we live,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.576
and back in Lebanon,
where grandma and grandpa live,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.736
we never see the pictures
of powerful women on the walls?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.640
Is it because women are not important?"

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.856
This is probably the hardest question
I've had to answer in my years as a parent

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.320
and in my 16-plus years
of professional life, for that matter.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.096
I had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.576
the younger of two daughters
to a very hard-working pilot

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.216
and director of operations
for the Lebanese Airlines

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.040
and a super-supportive
stay-at-home mom and grandma.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.056
My father had encouraged
my sister and I to pursue our education

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.376
even though our culture
emphasized at the time

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.400
that it was sons and not daughters
who should be professionally motivated.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.016
I was one of very few girls
of my generation

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.440
who left home at 18 to study abroad.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.296
My father didn't have a son,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.320
and so I, in a sense, became his.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.576
Fast-forward a couple of decades,
and I hope I didn't do too badly

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.200
in making my father proud
of his would-be son.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.816
As I got my Bachelor's and PhD
in electrical engineering,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.680
did R and D in the UK,
then consulting in the Middle East,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.960
I have always been
in male-dominated environments.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.200
Truth be told, I have never found
a role model I could truly identify with.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.002
My mother's generation
wasn't into professional leadership.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.056
There were some
encouraging men along the way,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.240
but none knew the demands
and pressures I was facing,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.639
pressures that got particularly acute
when I had my own two beautiful children.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.320
And although Western women love to give us
poor, oppressed Arab women advice,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.920
they live different lives
with different constraints.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.216
So Arab women of my generation
have had to become our own role models.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.496
We have had to juggle more than Arab men,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.880
and we have had to face
more cultural rigidity than Western women.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.816
As a result, I would like to think
that we poor, oppressed women

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.320
actually have some useful,
certainly hard-earned lessons to share,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.016
lessons that might turn out useful

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.600
for anyone wishing to thrive
in the modern world.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.736
Here are three of mine.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.616
["Convert their sh*t into your fuel."]

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.856
(Laughter)

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.680
(Applause)

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.656
There is this word that everybody
is touting as the key to success:

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.920
resilience.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.560
Well, what exactly is resilience,
and how do you develop it?

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.800
I believe resilience is simply
the ability to transform shit into fuel.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.456
In my previous job,
well before my current firm,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.600
I was working with a man
we will call John.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.816
I had teamed up with John
and was working hard,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.816
hoping he would notice how great I was

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.160
and that he would come to support
my case to make partner at the firm.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.216
I was, in addition to delivering
on my consulting projects,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.400
writing passionately on the topic
of women economic empowerment.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.920
One day, I got to present my research
to a roomful of MBA students.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.136
John was part of the audience

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.800
listening for the first time
to the details of my study.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.296
As I proceeded with my presentation,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.520
I could see John in the corner of my eye.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.536
He had turned a dark shade of pink

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.360
and had slid under his chair
in apparent shame.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.296
I finished my presentation
to an applauding audience

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.400
and we rushed out and jumped into the car.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.360
There he exploded.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.216
"What you did up there was unacceptable!

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.440
You are a consultant, not an activist!"

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.056
I said, "John, I don't understand.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.736
I presented a couple of
gender parity indices,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.815
and some conclusions about the Arab world.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.815
Yes, we do happen to be today
at the bottom of the index,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.040
but what is it that I said or presented
that was not factual?"

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.096
To which he replied,
"The whole premise of your study is wrong.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.960
What you are doing is dangerous and will
break the social fabric of our society."

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.096
He paused, then added,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.520
"When women have children,
their place is in the home."

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.616
Time stood still for a long while,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.336
and all I could think and repeat
in the chaos of my brain was:

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.536
"You can forget about
that partnership, Leila.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.132
It's just never going to happen."

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.576
It took me a couple of days to fully
absorb this incident and its implications,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.240
but once I did,
I reached three conclusions.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.696
One, that these were his issues,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.216
his complexes.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.296
There may be many like him in our society,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.520
but I would never let
their issues become mine.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.336
Two, that I needed
another sponsor, and fast.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.576
(Laughter)

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.816
I got one, by the way,
and boy, was he great.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.256
And three, that I would get to show John
what women with children can do.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.696
I apply this lesson equally well
to my personal life.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.496
As I have progressed in my career,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.976
I have received many words
of encouragement,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.296
but I have also often been met
by women, men and couples

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.056
who have clearly had an issue
with my husband and I

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.600
having chosen the path
of a dual-career couple.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.696
So you get this well-meaning couple

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.976
who tells you straight out
at a family gathering

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.256
or at a friends gathering,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.709
that, come on, you must know
you're not a great mom,

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:49.293
given how much you're investing
in your career, right?

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.416
I would lie if I said
these words didn't hurt.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.896
My children are the most
precious thing to me,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.600
and the thought that I could be
failing them in any way is intolerable.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.016
But just like I did with John,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.656
I quickly reminded myself
that these were their issues,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.880
their complexes.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.816
So instead of replying,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.136
I gave back one of my largest smiles

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.016
as I saw, in flashing light,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.176
the following sign in my mind's eye.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.256
[Be happy, it drives people crazy.]

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.520
(Applause)

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.096
You see, as a young woman
in these situations, you have two options.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.976
You can either decide
to internalize these negative messages

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.616
that are being thrown at you,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.616
to let them make you feel like a failure,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.216
like success is way too hard
to ever achieve,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.656
or you can choose to see that others'
negativity is their own issue,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.720
and instead transform it
into your own personal fuel.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.056
I have learned
to always go for option two,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.200
and I have found that it has taken me
from strength to strength.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.256
And it's true what they say:

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.440
success is the best revenge.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.376
Some women in the Middle East

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.816
are lucky enough to be married
to someone supportive of their career.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.296
Correction: I should say "smart enough,"

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.696
because who you marry is your own choice,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.320
and you'd better marry someone supportive
if you plan to have a long career.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.536
Still today, the Arab man
is not an equal contributor in the home.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.776
It's simply not expected by our society,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.240
and even frowned upon as not very manly.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.056
As for the Arab woman,
our society still assumes

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.816
that her primary source of happiness
should be the happiness and prosperity

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.776
of her children and husband.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.240
She mostly exists for her family.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.736
Things are changing,
but it will take time.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.256
For now, it means
that the professional Arab woman

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.616
has to somehow maintain the perfect home,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.736
make sure that her children's every need
is being taken care of

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.760
and manage her demanding career.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.096
To achieve this, I have found the hard way

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.896
that you need to apply your hard-earned
professional skills to your personal life.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.360
You need to work your life.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.240
Here is how I do this in my personal life.

00:08:00.998 --> 00:08:02.856
One thing to know about the Middle East

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.320
is that nearly every family
has access to affordable domestic help.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.320
The challenge therefore becomes
how to recruit effectively.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.456
Just like I would in my business life,
I have based the selection

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.536
of who would support me
with my children while I'm at work

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.760
on a strong referral.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.216
Cristina had worked
for four years with my sister

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.560
and the quality of her work
was well-established.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.136
She is now an integral
member of our family,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.760
having been with us
since Alia was six months old.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.895
She makes sure that the house
is running smoothly while I'm at work,

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.135
and I make sure to empower her

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.336
in the most optimal conditions
for her and my children,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.559
just like I would my best talent at work.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.136
This lesson applies
whatever your childcare situation,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.576
whether an au pair, nursery,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.936
part-time nanny
that you share with someone else.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.800
Choose very carefully, and empower.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.376
If you look at my calendar,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.376
you will see every working day

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.096
one and a half hours
from 7pm to 8:30pm UAE time

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.080
blocked and called "family time."

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.336
This is sacred time.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.760
I have done this
ever since Alia was a baby.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.456
I do everything in my power
to protect this time

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.896
so that I can be home by then
to spend quality time with my children,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.320
asking them about their day,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.256
checking up on homework,
reading them a bedtime story

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.856
and giving them
lots of kisses and cuddles.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.376
If I'm traveling,
in whatever the time zone,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.880
I use Skype to connect with my children
even if I am miles away.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.256
Our son Burhan is five years old,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.840
and he's learning to read
and do basic maths.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.496
Here's another confession:

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.256
I have found that our daughter
is actually more successful

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.176
at teaching him these skills than I am.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.920
(Laughter)

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.856
It started as a game, but Alia loves
playing teacher to her little brother,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.056
and I have found that these sessions
actually improve Burhan's literacy,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.456
increase Alia's sense of responsibility,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.456
and strengthen the bonding between them,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.760
a win-win all around.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.736
The successful Arab women I know

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.896
have each found their unique approach
to working their life

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.296
as they continue to shoulder

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.016
the lion's share
of responsibility in the home.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.656
But this is not just
about surviving in your dual role

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.376
as a career woman and mother.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.920
This is also about being in the present.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.856
When I am with my children,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.296
I try to leave work out of our lives.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.336
Instead of worrying about how many minutes
I can spend with them every day,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.136
I focus on turning these minutes
into memorable moments,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.376
moments where I'm seeing my kids,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.216
hearing them, connecting with them.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.016
["Join forces, don't compete."]

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.816
Arab women of my generation
have not been very visible

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.936
in the public eye as they grew up.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.856
This explains, I think, to some extent,

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.560
why you find so few women
in politics in the Arab world.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.816
The upside of this, however,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.936
is that we have spent a lot of time

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.400
developing a social skill
behind the scenes,

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.816
in coffee shops, in living rooms,

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.056
on the phone,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.856
a social skill that is
very important to success:

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.536
networking.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.216
I would say the average Arab woman

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.776
has a large network
of friends and acquaintances.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.800
The majority of those are also women.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.376
In the West, it seems like ambitious women
often compare themselves to other women

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.560
hoping to be noticed as the most
successful woman in the room.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.136
This leads to the much-spoken-about
competitive behavior

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.480
between professional women.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.736
If there's only room
for one woman at the top,

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.600
then you can't make room for others,
much less lift them up.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.256
Arab women, generally speaking,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.520
have not fallen
for this psychological trap.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.216
Faced with a patriarchal society,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.576
they have found
that by helping each other out,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.840
all benefit.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.296
In my previous job, I was the most
senior woman in the Middle East,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.176
so one could think that investing
in my network of female colleagues

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.776
couldn't bring many benefits

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.056
and that I should instead invest my time

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.800
developing my relationships
with male seniors and peers.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.320
Yet two of my biggest breaks
came through the support of other women.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.656
It was the head of marketing
who initially suggested

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.976
I be considered as a young global leader
to the World Economic Forum.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.976
She was familiar with my media engagements
and my publications,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.096
and when she was asked
to voice her opinion,

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.360
she highlighted my name.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.936
It was a young consultant,
a Saudi lady and friend,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.696
who helped me sell
my first project in Saudi Arabia,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.920
a market I was finding hard
to gain traction in as a woman.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.336
She introduced me to a client,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.496
and that introduction led to the first
of very many projects for me in Saudi.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.976
Today, I have two senior women on my team,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.240
and I see making them successful
as key to my own success.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.296
Women continue to advance in the world,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.696
not fast enough, but we're moving.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.816
The Arab world, too, is making progress,
despite many recent setbacks.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.456
Just this year, the UAE appointed
five new female ministers to its cabinet,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.800
for a total of eight female ministers.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.056
That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.896
and more than many
developed countries can claim.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.280
This is today my daughter
Alia's favorite picture.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.856
This is the result,
no doubt, of great leadership,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.496
but it is also the result
of strong Arab women

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.496
not giving up and continuously
pushing the boundaries.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.656
It is the result of Arab women
deciding every day like me

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.456
to convert shit into fuel,

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.016
to work their life
to keep work out of their life,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.080
and to join forces and not compete.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.376
As I look to the future,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.936
my hopes for my daughter
when she stands on this stage

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.776
some 20, 30 years from now

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.896
are that she be as proud
to call herself her mother's daughter

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.160
as her father's daughter.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.496
My hopes for my son

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.136
are that by then, the expression
"her mother's son" or "mama's boy"

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.560
would have taken on
a completely different meaning.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.336
Thank you.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:49.068
(Applause)
