00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:02.230
So this is my niece.

00:00:02.644 --> 00:00:04.179
Her name is Yahli.

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:05.714
She is nine months old.

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:08.729
Her mum is a doctor,
and her dad is a lawyer.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.275
By the time Yahli goes to college,

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.552
the jobs her parents do
are going to look dramatically different.

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:20.420
In 2013, researchers at Oxford University
did a study on the future of work.

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:24.905
They concluded that almost one
in every two jobs have a high risk

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.753
of being automated by machines.

00:00:28.388 --> 00:00:30.293
Machine learning is the technology

00:00:30.317 --> 00:00:32.595
that's responsible for most
of this disruption.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.409
It's the most powerful branch
of artificial intelligence.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.315
It allows machines to learn from data

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:39.931
and mimic some of the things
that humans can do.

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:43.370
My company, Kaggle, operates
on the cutting edge of machine learning.

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:45.780
We bring together
hundreds of thousands of experts

00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:48.922
to solve important problems
for industry and academia.

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:52.501
This gives us a unique perspective
on what machines can do,

00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:53.760
what they can't do

00:00:53.784 --> 00:00:56.723
and what jobs they might
automate or threaten.

00:00:57.316 --> 00:01:00.866
Machine learning started making its way
into industry in the early '90s.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.014
It started with relatively simple tasks.

00:01:03.406 --> 00:01:07.521
It started with things like assessing
credit risk from loan applications,

00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:11.598
sorting the mail by reading
handwritten characters from zip codes.

00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:15.205
Over the past few years, we have made
dramatic breakthroughs.

00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:19.502
Machine learning is now capable
of far, far more complex tasks.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.091
In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:26.304
to build an algorithm
that could grade high-school essays.

00:01:26.328 --> 00:01:28.932
The winning algorithms
were able to match the grades

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.621
given by human teachers.

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:34.076
Last year, we issued
an even more difficult challenge.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.053
Can you take images of the eye
and diagnose an eye disease

00:01:37.077 --> 00:01:38.771
called diabetic retinopathy?

00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:43.204
Again, the winning algorithms
were able to match the diagnoses

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.053
given by human ophthalmologists.

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:48.773
Now, given the right data,
machines are going to outperform humans

00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:49.962
at tasks like this.

00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:53.978
A teacher might read 10,000 essays
over a 40-year career.

00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:56.767
An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes.

00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.704
A machine can read millions of essays
or see millions of eyes

00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:02.004
within minutes.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:05.314
We have no chance of competing
against machines

00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:07.659
on frequent, high-volume tasks.

00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:12.389
But there are things we can do
that machines can't do.

00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:14.991
Where machines have made
very little progress

00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:16.869
is in tackling novel situations.

00:02:16.893 --> 00:02:20.792
They can't handle things
they haven't seen many times before.

00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:23.905
The fundamental limitations
of machine learning

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.323
is that it needs to learn
from large volumes of past data.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.101
Now, humans don't.

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:32.155
We have the ability to connect
seemingly disparate threads

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:34.417
to solve problems we've never seen before.

00:02:34.808 --> 00:02:39.219
Percy Spencer was a physicist
working on radar during World War II,

00:02:39.243 --> 00:02:42.256
when he noticed the magnetron
was melting his chocolate bar.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.265
He was able to connect his understanding
of electromagnetic radiation

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:47.773
with his knowledge of cooking

00:02:47.797 --> 00:02:51.055
in order to invent -- any guesses? --
the microwave oven.

00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:54.517
Now, this is a particularly remarkable
example of creativity.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.205
But this sort of cross-pollination
happens for each of us in small ways

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.057
thousands of times per day.

00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:02.162
Machines cannot compete with us

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:04.437
when it comes to tackling
novel situations,

00:03:04.461 --> 00:03:07.578
and this puts a fundamental limit
on the human tasks

00:03:07.602 --> 00:03:09.319
that machines will automate.

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:12.446
So what does this mean
for the future of work?

00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:17.336
The future state of any single job lies
in the answer to a single question:

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.341
To what extent is that job reducible
to frequent, high-volume tasks,

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:25.618
and to what extent does it involve
tackling novel situations?

00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:30.010
On frequent, high-volume tasks,
machines are getting smarter and smarter.

00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:32.748
Today they grade essays.
They diagnose certain diseases.

00:03:32.772 --> 00:03:35.929
Over coming years,
they're going to conduct our audits,

00:03:35.953 --> 00:03:38.920
and they're going to read boilerplate
from legal contracts.

00:03:38.944 --> 00:03:40.941
Accountants and lawyers are still needed.

00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:43.647
They're going to be needed
for complex tax structuring,

00:03:43.671 --> 00:03:45.028
for pathbreaking litigation.

00:03:45.052 --> 00:03:46.769
But machines will shrink their ranks

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.665
and make these jobs harder to come by.

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:49.840
Now, as mentioned,

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:52.813
machines are not making progress
on novel situations.

00:03:52.837 --> 00:03:56.294
The copy behind a marketing campaign
needs to grab consumers' attention.

00:03:56.318 --> 00:03:58.033
It has to stand out from the crowd.

00:03:58.057 --> 00:04:00.501
Business strategy means
finding gaps in the market,

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:02.281
things that nobody else is doing.

00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:06.423
It will be humans that are creating
the copy behind our marketing campaigns,

00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:09.964
and it will be humans that are developing
our business strategy.

00:04:09.988 --> 00:04:12.805
So Yahli, whatever you decide to do,

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.190
let every day bring you a new challenge.

00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:18.396
If it does, then you will stay
ahead of the machines.

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:20.302
Thank you.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:23.430
(Applause)
