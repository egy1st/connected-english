00:00:00.991 --> 00:00:03.850
Imagine that you are a product designer.

00:00:04.686 --> 00:00:06.132
And you've designed a product,

00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:09.780
a new type of product,
called the human immune system.

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:12.626
You're pitching this product

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.807
to a skeptical, strictly
no-nonsense manager.

00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:17.824
Let's call him Bob.

00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:20.010
I think we all know
at least one Bob, right?

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:22.713
How would that go?

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.957
Bob, I've got this incredible idea

00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:28.613
for a completely new type
of personal health product.

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:30.808
It's called the human immune system.

00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:34.676
I can see from your face that
you're having some problems with this.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.776
Don't worry. I know it's very complicated.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.457
I don't want to take you
through the gory details,

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:43.709
I just want to tell you about some
of the amazing features of this product.

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.662
First of all, it cleverly uses redundancy

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:49.818
by having millions of copies
of each component --

00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:52.027
leukocytes, white blood cells --

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.801
before they're actually needed,

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:57.320
to create a massive buffer
against the unexpected.

00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:01.636
And it cleverly leverages diversity

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.381
by having not just leukocytes
but B cells, T cells,

00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:07.613
natural killer cells, antibodies.

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:09.645
The components don't really matter.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.239
The point is that together,

00:01:11.263 --> 00:01:15.879
this diversity of different approaches
can cope with more or less anything

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:18.056
that evolution has been able to throw up.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.292
And the design is completely modular.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.149
You have the surface barrier
of the human skin,

00:01:27.173 --> 00:01:30.394
you have the very rapidly reacting
innate immune system

00:01:30.418 --> 00:01:34.440
and then you have the highly targeted
adaptive immune system.

00:01:35.017 --> 00:01:38.862
The point is, that if one system fails,
another can take over,

00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:41.937
creating a virtually foolproof system.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.461
I can see I'm losing you, Bob,
but stay with me,

00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:48.789
because here is the really killer feature.

00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:52.340
The product is completely adaptive.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.331
It's able to actually develop
targeted antibodies

00:01:57.355 --> 00:01:59.871
to threats that it's never
even met before.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.480
It actually also does this
with incredible prudence,

00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:09.179
detecting and reacting
to every tiny threat,

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:13.538
and furthermore, remembering
every previous threat,

00:02:13.562 --> 00:02:16.132
in case they are ever encountered again.

00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:20.405
What I'm pitching you today
is actually not a stand-alone product.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.984
The product is embedded
in the larger system of the human body,

00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:28.921
and it works in complete harmony
with that system,

00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:31.999
to create this unprecedented level
of biological protection.

00:02:32.023 --> 00:02:35.248
So Bob, just tell me honestly,
what do you think of my product?

00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:38.866
And Bob may say something like,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.805
I sincerely appreciate
the effort and passion

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.672
that have gone into your presentation,

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:45.850
blah blah blah --

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.054
(Laughter)

00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:50.131
But honestly, it's total nonsense.

00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:55.450
You seem to be saying that the key
selling points of your product

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:58.175
are that it is inefficient and complex.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.770
Didn't they teach you 80-20?

00:03:01.693 --> 00:03:05.121
And furthermore, you're saying
that this product is siloed.

00:03:05.676 --> 00:03:07.081
It overreacts,

00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:08.644
makes things up as it goes along

00:03:08.668 --> 00:03:11.159
and is actually designed
for somebody else's benefit.

00:03:11.183 --> 00:03:14.790
I'm sorry to break it to you,
but I don't think this one is a winner.

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:17.213
If we went with Bob's philosophy,

00:03:17.237 --> 00:03:20.705
I think we'd actually end up
with a more efficient immune system.

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.735
And efficiency is always important
in the short term.

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:28.298
Less complex, more efficient,
more bang for the buck.

00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:29.680
Who could say no to that?

00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:32.538
Unfortunately, there's one
very tiny problem,

00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:35.827
and that is that the user
of this product, you or I,

00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:39.524
would probably die
within one week of the next winter,

00:03:39.548 --> 00:03:43.412
when we encountered a new strain
of the influenza virus.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:49.361
I first became interested
in biology and business,

00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:51.764
and longevity and resilience,

00:03:51.788 --> 00:03:54.039
when I was asked a very unusual question

00:03:54.063 --> 00:03:56.735
by the CEO of a global tech company.

00:03:57.257 --> 00:03:58.707
And the question was:

00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:04.893
What do we have to do to make sure
that our company lasts 100 years?

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:08.381
A seemingly innocent question,

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:11.216
but actually, it's a little trickier
than you might think,

00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:16.567
considering that the average
US public company now

00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:20.089
can expect a life span of only 30 years.

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:23.754
That is less than half of the life span

00:04:23.778 --> 00:04:26.604
that its employees can expect to enjoy.

00:04:27.743 --> 00:04:29.999
Now, if you were the CEO
of such a company,

00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:33.710
badgered by investors
and buffeted by change,

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.894
we might forgive you
for not even worrying too much

00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:38.619
about what happens 30 years out.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.348
But here's something that should
keep you awake at night:

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.425
the probability that your company
will not be around in five year's time,

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.088
on average, is now
a staggering 32 percent.

00:04:52.164 --> 00:04:56.208
That's a one in three chance
that your company will be taken over

00:04:56.232 --> 00:04:59.025
or will fail within just five years.

00:05:01.696 --> 00:05:04.010
Let's come back
to our tech CEO's question.

00:05:04.034 --> 00:05:07.813
Where better to turn
for advice than nature,

00:05:07.837 --> 00:05:10.431
that's been in the business
of life and death

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:12.421
for longer than any company?

00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:16.930
As a lapsed biologist,

00:05:16.954 --> 00:05:20.315
I decided to immediately call
a real biologist,

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:22.353
my friend Simon Levin,

00:05:22.377 --> 00:05:25.581
Professor of Biology and Mathematics
at Princeton University.

00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:30.091
Together, we looked at a variety
of biological systems,

00:05:30.115 --> 00:05:33.381
ranging from natural tropical rainforests

00:05:33.405 --> 00:05:36.327
through to managed forests and fisheries.

00:05:36.351 --> 00:05:38.075
And we asked ourselves the question:

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.957
What makes these systems
resilient and enduring?

00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:48.321
And what we found
was that the same six principles

00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:51.370
that we saw underpinning
the miracle of the human immune system

00:05:51.394 --> 00:05:54.455
actually cropped up again and again,

00:05:55.157 --> 00:05:58.191
from redundancy through to embeddedness.

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.275
In fact, we saw these principles
not only in biologically enduring systems,

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:06.170
we also found them
being very characteristic

00:06:06.194 --> 00:06:08.581
of long-lived social systems,

00:06:08.605 --> 00:06:10.823
like the Roman Empire
and the Catholic Church,

00:06:10.847 --> 00:06:12.145
believe it or not.

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.007
We also went on to look at business,

00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:18.887
and found that these very same properties
also characterized businesses

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.871
that were resilient and long-lived,

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:25.014
and we noted their absence
from ones which were short-lived.

00:06:27.162 --> 00:06:31.184
Let's first take a look at what happens
when the corporate immune system

00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.373
collapses.

00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:37.744
This beautiful building is part
of the Shitennoji Temple Complex

00:06:37.768 --> 00:06:39.091
in Osaka, Japan.

00:06:39.672 --> 00:06:42.512
In fact, it's one of the oldest
temples in Japan.

00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:45.393
It was built by a Korean artisan,

00:06:45.417 --> 00:06:48.486
because at the time,
Japan was not yet building temples.

00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:53.673
And this Korean artisan went on
to found a temple-building company.

00:06:55.017 --> 00:06:58.422
Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi,

00:06:58.446 --> 00:07:03.670
was still around 1,428 years later.

00:07:03.694 --> 00:07:07.294
In fact, it became the oldest
continuously operating company

00:07:07.318 --> 00:07:08.562
in the world.

00:07:09.986 --> 00:07:11.999
So how is Kongō Gumi doing today?

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.737
Not too well, I'm afraid.

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:17.912
It borrowed very heavily

00:07:17.936 --> 00:07:20.714
during the bubble period
of the Japanese economy,

00:07:20.738 --> 00:07:22.201
to invest in real estate.

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:25.656
And when the bubble burst,
it couldn't refinance its loans.

00:07:26.463 --> 00:07:27.751
The company failed,

00:07:27.775 --> 00:07:30.992
and it was taken over
by a major construction company.

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:37.442
Tragically, after 40 generations
of very careful stewardship

00:07:37.466 --> 00:07:38.685
by the Kongō family,

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:43.514
Kongō Gumi succumbed
to a spectacular lapse

00:07:43.538 --> 00:07:47.489
in the ability to apply
a principle of prudence.

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:50.044
Speaking of company failures:

00:07:51.552 --> 00:07:54.267
we're all familiar
with the failure of Kodak,

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:57.470
the company that declared bankruptcy

00:07:57.494 --> 00:07:59.119
in January 2012.

00:08:01.322 --> 00:08:05.261
Much more interesting,
however, is the question:

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:06.906
Why did Fujifilm --

00:08:07.662 --> 00:08:12.905
same product, same pressures
from digital technology, same time --

00:08:12.929 --> 00:08:16.635
why was Fujifilm
able to survive and flourish?

00:08:18.846 --> 00:08:24.817
Fujifilm used its capabilities
in chemistry, material science and optics

00:08:25.558 --> 00:08:28.313
to diversify into a number of areas,

00:08:28.953 --> 00:08:32.001
ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals,

00:08:32.025 --> 00:08:34.011
to medical systems to biomaterials.

00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:36.720
Some of these diversification
attempts failed.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.064
But in aggregate,

00:08:39.088 --> 00:08:43.428
it was able to adapt
its portfolio sufficiently

00:08:43.452 --> 00:08:45.227
to survive and flourish.

00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:49.476
As the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.736
the strategy succeeded
because it had "more pockets and drawers"

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.151
than the rivals.

00:08:55.175 --> 00:08:56.326
He meant, of course,

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.777
that they were able to create
more options than the rivals.

00:09:01.137 --> 00:09:05.550
Fujifilm survived because it applied
the principles of prudence,

00:09:05.574 --> 00:09:06.965
diversity

00:09:06.989 --> 00:09:08.158
and adaptation.

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:12.576
A catastrophic factory fire,
like the one we see here,

00:09:13.308 --> 00:09:16.326
completely wiped out, in one evening,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:23.255
the only plant which supplied Toyota
with valves for car-braking systems.

00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:26.693
The ultimate test of resilience.

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.988
Car production ground
to a screeching halt.

00:09:32.629 --> 00:09:37.066
How was it, then, that Toyota
was able to recover car production?

00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:40.184
Can you imagine how long it took?

00:09:40.208 --> 00:09:41.511
Just five days.

00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:46.034
From having no braking valves
to complete recovery in five days.

00:09:46.966 --> 00:09:48.191
How was this possible?

00:09:48.747 --> 00:09:54.033
Toyota managed its network of suppliers
in such a collaborative manner

00:09:54.057 --> 00:09:58.293
that it could work very quickly
and smoothly with suppliers

00:09:58.317 --> 00:10:00.028
to repurpose production,

00:10:01.099 --> 00:10:03.629
fill the missing braking valve capacity

00:10:03.653 --> 00:10:06.962
and have car production come online again.

00:10:08.093 --> 00:10:12.395
Toyota applied the principles
of modularity of its supply network,

00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:14.563
embeddedness in an integrated system

00:10:15.154 --> 00:10:19.190
and the functional redundancy
to be able to repurpose, smoothly,

00:10:19.214 --> 00:10:20.634
existing capacity.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:27.165
Now fortunately, few companies
succumb to catastrophic fires.

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:30.282
But we do read in the newspaper
every day about companies

00:10:30.306 --> 00:10:33.705
succumbing to the disruption
of technology.

00:10:34.612 --> 00:10:38.534
How is it, then, that the consumer
optics giant Essilor

00:10:38.558 --> 00:10:42.604
is able to avoid technology disruption,
and even profit from it?

00:10:43.095 --> 00:10:46.539
And yes, technology disruption
is not only a big deal

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:48.648
in software and electronics.

00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:53.655
Essilor carefully scans
the competitive environment

00:10:54.262 --> 00:10:56.514
for potentially disruptive technologies.

00:10:57.483 --> 00:11:00.293
It acquires those technologies very early,

00:11:00.317 --> 00:11:04.093
before they've become expensive
or competitors have mobilized around them,

00:11:04.117 --> 00:11:06.662
and it then develops
those technologies itself,

00:11:07.297 --> 00:11:09.239
even at the risk of failure

00:11:09.263 --> 00:11:11.388
or the risk of self-disruption.

00:11:12.409 --> 00:11:15.027
Essilor stays ahead of its game,

00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:17.057
and has delivered spectacular performance

00:11:17.081 --> 00:11:18.524
for over 40 years,

00:11:18.548 --> 00:11:22.745
by using the principles
of prudence and adaptation.

00:11:23.901 --> 00:11:27.298
OK, if these principles are so powerful,
you might be thinking,

00:11:27.986 --> 00:11:30.893
why are they not commonplace in business?

00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:33.143
Why do we not use these words every day?

00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:35.952
Well, change has to first
start in the mind.

00:11:35.976 --> 00:11:38.021
If we think back to our pitch to Bob,

00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:40.433
in order to apply the principles

00:11:40.457 --> 00:11:43.214
that underpin the miracle
of the human immune system,

00:11:43.827 --> 00:11:46.231
we first need to think differently

00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:47.425
about business.

00:11:47.838 --> 00:11:50.545
Now typically, when we think
about business,

00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:53.051
we use what I call "mechanical thinking."

00:11:53.962 --> 00:11:55.599
We set goals,

00:11:55.623 --> 00:11:57.162
we analyze problems,

00:11:57.186 --> 00:11:59.513
we construct and we adhere to plans,

00:11:59.537 --> 00:12:00.880
and more than anything else,

00:12:00.904 --> 00:12:03.915
we stress efficiency
and short-term performance.

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:05.594
Now, don't get me wrong --

00:12:05.618 --> 00:12:08.732
this is a splendidly practical
and effective way

00:12:08.756 --> 00:12:11.196
of addressing relatively simple challenges

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.210
in relatively stable environments.

00:12:14.005 --> 00:12:17.467
It's the way that Bob -- and probably
many of us, myself included --

00:12:17.491 --> 00:12:20.460
process most business problems
we're faced with every day.

00:12:21.374 --> 00:12:25.012
In fact, it was a pretty good
mental model for business --

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:26.557
overall --

00:12:26.581 --> 00:12:28.609
until about the mid-1980s,

00:12:28.633 --> 00:12:31.997
when the conjunction of globalization

00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:34.544
and a revolution in technology
and telecommunications

00:12:34.568 --> 00:12:37.006
made business far more
dynamic and unpredictable.

00:12:37.497 --> 00:12:40.575
But what about those more dynamic
and unpredictable situations

00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:42.690
that we now increasingly face?

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:46.012
I think in addition
to the mechanical thinking,

00:12:46.036 --> 00:12:49.729
we now need to master the art
of biological thinking,

00:12:50.417 --> 00:12:52.378
as embodied by our six principles.

00:12:53.245 --> 00:12:56.898
In other words, we need to think
more modestly and subtly

00:12:56.922 --> 00:12:59.218
about when and how

00:12:59.242 --> 00:13:02.014
we can shape, rather than control,

00:13:02.928 --> 00:13:06.138
unpredictable and complex situations.

00:13:07.551 --> 00:13:10.661
It's a little like the difference
between throwing a ball

00:13:11.403 --> 00:13:12.708
and releasing a bird.

00:13:13.685 --> 00:13:15.628
The ball would head in a straight line,

00:13:15.652 --> 00:13:17.870
probably towards the intended target,

00:13:17.894 --> 00:13:21.001
and the bird certainly would not.

00:13:23.455 --> 00:13:25.049
So what do you think?

00:13:25.073 --> 00:13:28.360
Sounds a little impractical,
a little theoretical, perhaps?

00:13:29.821 --> 00:13:30.978
Not at all.

00:13:31.657 --> 00:13:34.038
Every small entrepreneurial company

00:13:35.038 --> 00:13:37.882
naturally thinks and acts biologically.

00:13:38.404 --> 00:13:39.555
Why?

00:13:39.579 --> 00:13:42.209
Because it lacks the resources
to shape its environment

00:13:42.233 --> 00:13:43.527
through brute force.

00:13:43.551 --> 00:13:46.190
It lacks the scale to buffer change,

00:13:47.254 --> 00:13:50.427
and it's constantly thinking
about the tough odds

00:13:50.451 --> 00:13:52.577
for a start-up to survive.

00:13:54.637 --> 00:13:56.035
Now, the irony is, of course,

00:13:56.059 --> 00:13:59.636
that every large company started off
as a small, entrepreneurial company.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.231
But along the way somewhere,

00:14:01.255 --> 00:14:05.346
many have lost this ability
to think and act biologically.

00:14:06.604 --> 00:14:10.400
They need to rejuvenate
their ability to think biologically

00:14:11.603 --> 00:14:15.220
in order to survive and thrive
in today's environment.

00:14:16.704 --> 00:14:19.313
So let's not just think
about short-term performance.

00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:22.955
Every company I know spends plenty of time

00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:25.376
thinking about the central
question of strategy:

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.299
How good is our competitive game?

00:14:27.802 --> 00:14:30.144
In addition, let's also consider

00:14:30.168 --> 00:14:34.229
the second, more biological
and equally important question:

00:14:34.253 --> 00:14:36.659
How long will that game last?

00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:38.262
Thank you very much.

00:14:38.286 --> 00:14:41.456
(Applause)
