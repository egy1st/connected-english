00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You know, one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm really here by accident.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And what I mean -- not at TED -- that I'm --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
at this point in my life, truly my set of circumstances

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I would truly consider an accident.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But what I'd like to talk to you about today

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is perhaps a way in which we could use technology

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to make those accidents happen often.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Because I really think, when I look back at how I actually ended up

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in this accident, technology played a big role in that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
are children and education.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And once I put that in context,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'd like to tell you a little bit about technology:

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler;

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Then, about the initiative that Chris mentioned,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And then I'll come back to the beginning,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you --

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that I believe that in today's world,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
it is really important for business leaders

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
not only to have an idea of what their business is all about,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
but to have a passion for something that is meaningful.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So I grew up in a family of women.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And, as you can imagine, if you can picture this:

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I was born in a very small village in Mexico,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and my parents did not have a college education.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that my parents placed on education.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
My parents were fanatics about learning,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and I'll come back to that a little bit later.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But one of the things that exposed me early to learning,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Victrola.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
My father found that in a junkyard,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow --

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
of what was going on in the world -- but,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
was a real exposure to me to classical music.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
He explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that became so famous in the world.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And would tell me a little bit about history too,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
when he'd play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
on this little Victrola, and he would tell me about Russia

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and why this music,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in some way, represented a little bit of that history.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
but if you can imagine the time when this occurred --

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
it was in the mid '40s -- this was really, in his view, a pretty piece of high tech.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Well, one of the things that is really critical to try to

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
distill from that experience is that in addition to that,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
people ask me and say, "Well,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
how did your parents treat you when you were a child?"

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And I always said that they were really tough on me.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And not tough in the sense that most people think of,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
They were tough in the sense that, as I grew up,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
both my mother and father would always say to me,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
it's really important that you always remember two things.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
First of all, when you go to bed at night,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
you've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
the day was a day which you contributed something, and

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And the second thing they said: and we trust you,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that no matter where you are or where you go,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
you will always do the right thing.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
but if you do, please trust me,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
it's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
(Laughter)

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
-- we trust you that you will always do the right thing.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
When I was out with my friends drinking beer,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I always was very aware of those words --

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
(Laughter)

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
-- and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and it can only be helpful if it's affordable.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And in today's world, being useful, affordable and accessible

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
is not necessarily what happens

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
in a lot of the technology that is done today.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So, one of our passions in our company,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
at making the technology useful, accessible and affordable.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And to me, that is very, very critical.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Now, technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
You know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Although frankly speaking, we don't believe the Internet is the killer app.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
What we believe is that the Internet, frankly,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
is a connection of people and ideas.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
The Internet happens to be just the medium

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
in which those people and ideas get connected.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
If we can connect people and ideas more intensely -- and although

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
you've seen a plethora and a myriad of products

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that have come to the market today, the key to me is

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity, in a useful way,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
accessibility, in an easy manner,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and also affordability, that

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
regardless of the economic status that a person could have,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And a couple of years ago at AMD,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
we came up with this idea of saying,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
what if we create this initiative we call 50x15,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
half of the world will be connected to the Internet

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
so that people and ideas can get connected.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We knew we couldn't do it by ourselves, and by no means

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
We always felt that this was something that could be done

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
through partnerships with governments, industry,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
educational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So, it is really a rather lofty initiative,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
if you want to think that way,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that was bold enough and courageous enough

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
the results so far have been remarkable,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and I can only anticipate and get real excited about

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
what I think is going to happen in the next eight years,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
while we get to the 2015 initiative.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Where are we today?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
That's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Those of you who've never looked at their website,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
you should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
how the Internet penetration has changed over the years.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
well, where are we related to our goal towards 2015,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
One is the Western world,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
has made an awful lot of progress.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
The connectivity in these parts of the world

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
As a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
even before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
such as India and China, the progress has been good --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
has been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I was just recently visiting South Africa.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and one of the things that we talked about is, what is it

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And one of the reasons is, in South Africa,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
It is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
to be able to bring the cost of this technology down.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So, when you look at this chart,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
you look at the very last -- it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
you look at the very end:

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
we've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
But we're excited in our company; we're motivated.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
to force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
working with so many partners around the world,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
to be able to reach that goal.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Now, one of the things I'd like to explain [about] 50x15,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
which I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It is actually a business venture.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Let's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and call it the education market.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
When you look at elementary-school children,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that could benefit tremendously

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
from being able to be connected to the Internet.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Therefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
to have a business that addresses the need of that segment.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
we said it very clearly: this is not a charity.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
This is really a business venture,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Because what we have learned in the last three years

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
is that this segment of the market, whether it's education

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
or under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
that frankly, without actually doing it,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
it would be very difficult to understand, and

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I'll explain that in just a minute.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
It is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
What we mean by that is,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
you know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
more or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
when I say this, but I truly mean it --

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
it would be very difficult to judge who made it,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So, there has not been a human-centric approach

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
to addressing this segment of the market,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
so we really believe it is critical to think of it.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning, about this

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
We're talking about something very similar here.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
the government plays a key role in the development of technology.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
In other parts, it doesn't.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
that allows for manufacturing to take place.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
In other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
about how this technology can be developed

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and put into action in those regions.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And the last piece, which is really important --

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one --

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
can come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
What I mean by that, and let me use this example,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
the country of South Africa, because I was just there,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
It's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
It's beginning to grow tremendously.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
They're developing a software-training environment in their universities.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
What a place, what an ideal place

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
needed for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
they have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two --

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
English and Afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
it could only be done from inside.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
by companies parachuting from another place of the world,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and just dumping product and selling into the markets.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
So, we believe that in those regions of the world

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
where the population is large,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and there's an infrastructure that can provide it,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
that a local, integrated, end-to-end system

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
is really critical for its success.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
This is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
in Mexico, in my home country.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
This particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico --

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Michoacan is a very colorful state.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Children dress with very colorful, colorful clothes,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
in a computer. And I have to tell you that it's

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
in the West Cape in South Africa,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and when you see the faces and activities of these children

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
being able to access computers, it's just phenomenal.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And recently, they've written us letters,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
telling us how excited they are about the impact

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
that this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
on their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
We have now deployed 30 different technologists

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
in 18 different countries, and we have been able

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
what this particular segment of the market needs and demands.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And I have to tell you that although

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
millions doesn't sound like a lot

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
in terms of the billions that need to be connected,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
it's a start. And we are learning a lot.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And we're learning a tremendous amount about

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
One example of this has been the One Laptop per Child.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Some of you are familiar with this.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies --

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Google is involved, Red Hat -- and AMD is a key player.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
are based on AMD technology; it's a microprocessor.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Because it was felt that a school day

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
would last at least eight hours, and

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
for at least one full day without having to recharge it.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and battery life on this product is now 15 hours --

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
just through a lot of innovative work people have done

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
in the field of education.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
not only in the developing countries, but actually

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
in the developed regions as well, because

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
there are parts of the United States where this can have

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
We also have partnered with TED

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
in this project, with Architecture for Humanity,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
we're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Let me come back to the beginning,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
to end this presentation.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
I'll tell you that one of the things

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
that I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
and look at numbers and say, yes, that's a good business.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I really believe that you have to have a passion for it.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents --

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
and I'll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And it took me a while to understand it,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
but he said to me, when I went to college, he said,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
"You're the first person in the family to go to college.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And it's really important you understand

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
that for civilization to make progress,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
each generation has to do better than the last one.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And therefore, this is your opportunity to do better than my generation."

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Frankly, I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
I was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000
and girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
I graduated. I decided to get married.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, "You know,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
I'm going to remind you again, that each generation

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
has to do better than the last one.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
You have to be a better husband than I was,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
because that's how you make progress." And now he began to make sense.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Because I knew what a great husband he was,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
my first child, and again, my father comes

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
to the hospital, and we're looking at the glass,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
and see all the children on the other side, and he said,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
"I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
you're going to have to be a better father than I was."

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
That's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
that he was placing on me, because he was a great father.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000

But the key is that he instilled in me a passion

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
to really get up and think that my role in life

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
It's got to be that someday I can look back,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
and this place is truly better through some small contribution

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
that perhaps each of us could make.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Thank you very much.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
(Applause)
