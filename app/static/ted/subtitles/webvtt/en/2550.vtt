00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.600
Is there life beyond Earth
in our solar system?

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.600
Wow, what a powerful question.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.656
You know, as a scientist --

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.896
planetary scientist --

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.480
we really didn't take that
very seriously until recently.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.496
Carl Sagan always said,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.920
"It takes extraordinary evidence
for extraordinary claims."

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.480
And the claims of having life beyond Earth

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.536
need to be definitive,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.176
they need to be loud

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.760
and they need to be everywhere
for us to be able to believe it.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.360
So how do we make this journey?

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.696
What we decided to do

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.920
is first look for
those ingredients for life.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.936
The ingredients of life are:

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.176
liquid water --

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.896
we have to have a solvent,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.000
can't be ice, has to be liquid.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.736
We also have to have energy.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.776
We also have to have organic material --

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.096
things that make us up,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.640
but also things that we need to consume.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.416
So we have to have these elements

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.256
in environments for long periods of time

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.816
for us to be able
to be confident that life,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.136
in that moment when it starts,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.040
can spark and then grow and evolve.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.760
Well, I have to tell you
that early in my career,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.776
when we looked at those three elements,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.056
I didn't believe
that they were beyond Earth

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.176
in any length of time
and for any real quantity.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.456
Why? We look at the inner planets.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.456
Venus is way too hot -- it's got no water.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.496
Mars -- dry and arid.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.056
It's got no water.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.856
And beyond Mars,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.840
the water in the solar system
is all frozen.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.256
But recent observations
have changed all that.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.176
It's now turning our attention
to the right places

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.736
for us to take a deeper look

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.320
and really start to answer
our life question.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.096
So when we look out into the solar system,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.759
where are the possibilities?

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.600
We're concentrating our attention
on four locations.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.680
The planet Mars

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.640
and then three moons of the outer planets:

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.480
Titan, Europa and small Enceladus.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.616
So what about Mars?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.440
Let's go through the evidence.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.456
Well, Mars we thought
was initially moon-like:

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.840
full of craters, arid and a dead world.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.096
And so about 15 years ago,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.736
we started a series
of missions to go to Mars

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.376
and see if water existed
on Mars in its past

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.656
that changed its geology.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.400
We ought to be able to notice that.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.496
And indeed we started
to be surprised right away.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.656
Our higher resolution images
show deltas and river valleys and gulleys

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.360
that were there in the past.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.536
And in fact,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.776
Curiosity --

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.096
which has been roving on the surface
now for about three years --

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.296
has really shown us that it's sitting
in an ancient river bed,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.720
where water flowed rapidly.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.736
And not for a little while,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.240
perhaps hundreds of millions of years.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.416
And if everything was there,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.776
including organics,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.656
perhaps life had started.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.576
Curiosity has also
drilled in that red soil

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.576
and brought up other material.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.256
And we were really excited
when we saw that.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.296
Because it wasn't red Mars,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.936
it was gray material,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.256
it's gray Mars.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.736
We brought it into the rover,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.376
we tasted it,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.856
and guess what?

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.896
We tasted organics --

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.296
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.816
nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur --

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.216
they were all there.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.736
So Mars in its past,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.096
with a lot of water,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.096
perhaps plenty of time,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.536
could have had life,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.800
could have had that spark,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.296
could have grown.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.616
And is that life still there?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.616
We don't know that.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.056
But a few years ago

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.416
we started to look at a number of craters.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.656
During the summer,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.696
dark lines would appear
down the sides of these craters.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.976
The more we looked,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.456
the more craters we saw,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.816
the more of these features.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.720
We now know more than a dozen of them.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.536
A few months ago the fairy tale came true.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.656
We announced to the world
that we know what these streaks are.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.280
It's liquid water.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.576
These craters are weeping
during the summer.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.536
Liquid water is flowing
down these craters.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.296
So what are we going to do now --

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.760
now that we see the water?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.736
Well, it tells us that Mars has
all the ingredients necessary for life.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.336
In its past it had perhaps
two-thirds of its northern hemisphere --

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.856
there was an ocean.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.776
It has weeping water right now.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.576
Liquid water on its surface.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.216
It has organics.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.480
It has all the right conditions.

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.016
So what are we going to do next?

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.456
We're going to launch a series of missions

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.256
to begin that search for life on Mars.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.760
And now it's more appealing
than ever before.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.296
As we move out into the solar system,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.296
here's the tiny moon Enceladus.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.696
This is not in what we call
the traditional habitable zone,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.936
this area around the sun.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.816
This is much further out.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.520
This object should be
ice over a silicate core.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.816
But what did we find?

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.776
Cassini was there since 2006,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.176
and after a couple years
looked back after it flew by Enceladus

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.896
and surprised us all.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.696
Enceladus is blasting sheets of water
out into the solar system

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.000
and sloshing back down onto the moon.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.936
What a fabulous environment.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.776
Cassini just a few months ago
also flew through the plume,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.200
and it measured silicate particles.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.656
Where does the silica come from?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.040
It must come from the ocean floor.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.936
The tidal energy is generated by Saturn,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.096
pulling and squeezing this moon --

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.776
is melting that ice,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.256
creating an ocean.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.600
But it's also doing that to the core.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.456
Now, the only thing that we can think of

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.320
that does that here on Earth
as an analogy ...

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.240
are hydrothermal vents.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.056
Hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean
were discovered in 1977.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.840
Oceanographers were completely surprised.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.840
And now there are thousands
of these below the ocean.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.456
What do we find?

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.816
The oceanographers, when they go
and look at these hydrothermal vents,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.136
they're teeming with life,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.696
regardless of whether the water
is acidic or alkaline --

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.256
doesn't matter.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.000
So hydrothermal vents are
a fabulous abode for life here on Earth.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.440
So what about Enceladus?

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.056
Well, we believe because it has water

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.840
and has had it for
a significant period of time,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.376
and we believe it has hydrothermal vents

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.760
with perhaps the right organic material,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.616
it is a place where life could exist.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.536
And not just microbial --

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.280
maybe more complex
because it's had time to evolve.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.616
Another moon, very similar,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.176
is Europa.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.016
Galileo visited Jupiter's system in 1996

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.880
and made fabulous observations of Europa.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.856
Europa, we also know,
has an under-the-ice crust ocean.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.256
Galileo mission told us that,
but we never saw any plumes.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.000
But we didn't look for them.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.936
Hubble,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.776
just a couple years ago,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.776
observing Europa,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.336
saw plumes of water

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.336
spraying from the cracks
in the southern hemisphere,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.120
just exactly like Enceladus.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.456
These moons,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.256
which are not in what we call
a traditional habitable zone,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.256
that are out in the solar system,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.056
have liquid water.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.056
And if there are organics there,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.280
there may be life.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.775
This is a fabulous set of discoveries

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:38.015
because these moons
have been in this environment like that

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.240
for billions of years.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.360
Life started here on Earth, we believe,
after about the first 500 million,

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.120
and look where we are.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.800
These moons are fabulous moons.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.880
Another moon that we're
looking at is Titan.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.736
Titan is a huge moon of Saturn.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.280
It perhaps is much larger
than the planet Mercury.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.976
It has an extensive atmosphere.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.616
It's so extensive --

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.216
and it's mostly nitrogen
with a little methane and ethane --

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.656
that you have to peer
through it with radar.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.160
And on the surface,
Cassini has found liquid.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.360
We see lakes ...

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.296
actually almost the size
of our Black Sea in some places.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.416
And this area is not liquid water;

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.680
it's methane.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.080
If there's any place in the solar system
where life is not like us,

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.616
where the substitute of water
is another solvent --

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.016
and it could be methane --

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.320
it could be Titan.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.896
Well, is there life beyond Earth
in the solar system?

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.176
We don't know yet,

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.256
but we're hot on the pursuit.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.896
The data that we're receiving
is really exciting

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.296
and telling us --

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.280
forcing us to think about this
in new and exciting ways.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.256
I believe we're on the right track.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.136
That in the next 10 years,
we will answer that question.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.096
And if we answer it,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.976
and it's positive,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.760
then life is everywhere
in the solar system.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.576
Just think about that.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.200
We may not be alone.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.456
Thank you.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:26.637
(Applause)
