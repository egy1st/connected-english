WEBVTT

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.840
We are stealing nature from our children.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.896
Now, when I say this, I don't mean
that we are destroying nature

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.296
that they will have wanted us to preserve,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.976
although that is
unfortunately also the case.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.816
What I mean here is that we've started
to define nature in a way

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.856
that's so purist and so strict

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.616
that under the definition
we're creating for ourselves,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.016
there won't be any nature
left for our children

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.240
when they're adults.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.656
But there's a fix for this.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.920
So let me explain.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.136
Right now, humans use half of the world

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.856
to live, to grow their crops
and their timber,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.776
to pasture their animals.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.616
If you added up all the human beings,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.880
we would weigh 10 times as much
as all the wild mammals put together.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.120
We cut roads through the forest.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.016
We have added little plastic particles
to the sand on ocean beaches.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.136
We've changed the chemistry of the soil
with our artificial fertilizers.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.376
And of course, we've changed
the chemistry of the air.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.256
So when you take your next breath,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.136
you'll be breathing in
42 percent more carbon dioxide

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.360
than if you were breathing in 1750.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.736
So all of these changes, and many others,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.840
have come to be kind of lumped together
under this rubric of the "Anthropocene."

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.016
And this is a term
that some geologists are suggesting

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.856
we should give to our current epoch,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.640
given how pervasive
human influence has been over it.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.176
Now, it's still just a proposed epoch,
but I think it's a helpful way

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.880
to think about the magnitude
of human influence on the planet.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.496
So where does this put nature?

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.240
What counts as nature in a world
where everything is influenced by humans?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.576
So 25 years ago, environmental writer
Bill McKibben said

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.096
that because nature
was a thing apart from man

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.696
and because climate change meant

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.336
that every centimeter of the Earth
was altered by man,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.456
then nature was over.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.840
In fact, he called his book
"The End of Nature."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.256
I disagree with this.
I just disagree with this.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.616
I disagree with this definition of nature,
because, fundamentally, we are animals.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.456
Right? Like, we evolved on this planet

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.576
in the context of all the other animals
with which we share a planet,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.176
and all the other plants,
and all the other microbes.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.496
And so I think that nature

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.576
is not that which is untouched
by humanity, man or woman.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.736
I think that nature
is anywhere where life thrives,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.776
anywhere where there are
multiple species together,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.016
anywhere that's green and blue
and thriving and filled with life

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.240
and growing.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.496
And under that definition,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.056
things look a little bit different.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.776
Now, I understand that there
are certain parts of this nature

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.416
that speak to us in a special way.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.096
Places like Yellowstone,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.816
or the Mongolian steppe,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.176
or the Great Barrier Reef

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.696
or the Serengeti.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.736
Places that we think of
as kind of Edenic representations

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.360
of a nature before
we screwed everything up.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.576
And in a way, they are less impacted
by our day to day activities.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.296
Many of these places
have no roads or few roads,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.896
so on, like such.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.696
But ultimately, even these Edens
are deeply influenced by humans.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.976
Now, let's just take
North America, for example,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.616
since that's where we're meeting.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.056
So between about 15,000 years ago
when people first came here,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.576
they started a process
of interacting with the nature

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.976
that led to the extinction
of a big slew of large-bodied animals,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.256
from the mastodon
to the giant ground sloth,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.536
saber-toothed cats,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.176
all of these cool animals
that unfortunately are no longer with us.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.016
And when those animals went extinct,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.616
you know, the ecosystems
didn't stand still.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.256
Massive ripple effects
changed grasslands into forests,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.080
changed the composition of forest
from one tree to another.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.656
So even in these Edens,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.496
even in these perfect-looking places

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.016
that seem to remind us
of a past before humans,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.120
we're essentially looking
at a humanized landscape.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.536
Not just these prehistoric humans,
but historical humans, indigenous people

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.800
all the way up until the moment
when the first colonizers showed up.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.256
And the case is the same
for the other continents as well.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.096
Humans have just been involved in nature

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.000
in a very influential way
for a very long time.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.216
Now, just recently, someone told me,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.096
"Oh, but there are still wild places."

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.336
And I said, "Where? Where? I want to go."

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.256
And he said, "The Amazon."

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.736
And I was like, "Oh, the Amazon.
I was just there.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.896
It's awesome. National Geographic
sent me to ManÃº National Park,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.496
which is in the Peruvian Amazon,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.176
but it's a big chunk of rainforest,
uncleared, no roads,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.816
protected as a national park,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.536
one of the most, in fact,
biodiverse parks in the world.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.680
And when I got in there with my canoe,
what did I find, but people.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.456
People have been living there
for hundreds and thousands of years.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.336
People live there, and they don't
just float over the jungle.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.960
They have a meaningful relationship
with the landscape.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.776
They hunt. They grow crops.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.296
They domesticate crops.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.216
They use the natural resources
to build their houses,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.496
to thatch their houses.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.536
They even make pets out of animals
that we consider to be wild animals.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.656
These people are there

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.776
and they're interacting
with the environment

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.296
in a way that's really meaningful
and that you can see in the environment.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.536
Now, I was with
an anthropologist on this trip,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.416
and he told me, as we were
floating down the river,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.096
he said, "There are
no demographic voids in the Amazon."

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.056
This statement has really stuck with me,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.936
because what it means
is that the whole Amazon is like this.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.240
There's people everywhere.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.216
And many other
tropical forests are the same,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.816
and not just tropical forests.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.056
People have influenced
ecosystems in the past,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.856
and they continue
to influence them in the present,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.040
even in places where
they're harder to notice.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.936
So, if all of the definitions of nature
that we might want to use

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.936
that involve it being
untouched by humanity

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.296
or not having people in it,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.656
if all of those actually give us
a result where we don't have any nature,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.096
then maybe they're the wrong definitions.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.616
Maybe we should define it
by the presence of multiple species,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.680
by the presence of a thriving life.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.456
Now, if we do it that way,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.936
what do we get?

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.336
Well, it's this kind of miracle.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.640
All of a sudden,
there's nature all around us.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.856
All of a sudden,
we see this Monarch caterpillar

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.736
munching on this plant,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.576
and we realize that there it is,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.400
and it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.656
And look at this empty lot.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.456
I mean, there's, like, probably,

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.416
a dozen, minimum,
plant species growing there,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.696
supporting all kinds of insect life,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.056
and this is a completely unmanaged space,
a completely wild space.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.056
This is a kind of wild nature
right under our nose,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.560
that we don't even notice.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.976
And there's an interesting
little paradox, too.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.816
So this nature,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.496
this kind of wild, untended part

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.296
of our urban, peri-urban,
suburban agricultural existence

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.696
that flies under the radar,

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.400
it's arguably more wild
than a national park,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.576
because national parks
are very carefully managed

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.336
in the 21st century.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.936
Crater Lake in southern Oregon,
which is my closest national park,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.136
is a beautiful example of a landscape
that seems to be coming out of the past.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.896
But they're managing it carefully.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.496
One of the issues they have now
is white bark pine die-off.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.016
White bark pine
is a beautiful, charismatic --

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.056
I'll say it's a charismatic megaflora

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.736
that grows up at high altitude --

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.736
and it's got all these problems
right now with disease.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.896
There's a blister rust
that was introduced,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.416
bark beetle.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.016
So to deal with this,
the park service has been planting

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.760
rust-resistant white bark
pine seedlings in the park,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.600
even in areas that they are
otherwise managing as wilderness.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.016
And they're also putting out
beetle repellent in key areas

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.920
as I saw last time I went hiking there.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.976
And this kind of thing is really
much more common than you would think.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.696
National parks are heavily managed.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.776
The wildlife is kept to a certain
population size and structure.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.336
Fires are suppressed.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.656
Fires are started.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.856
Non-native species are removed.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.576
Native species are reintroduced.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.936
And in fact, I took a look,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.016
and Banff National Park
is doing all of the things I just listed:

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.496
suppressing fire, having fire,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.736
radio-collaring wolves,
reintroducing bison.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.976
It takes a lot of work to make
these places look untouched.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.056
(Laughter)

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.480
(Applause)

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.535
And in a further irony,
these places that we love the most

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.256
are the places that we love
a little too hard, sometimes.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.696
A lot of us like to go there,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.256
and because we're managing
them to be stable

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.336
in the face of a changing planet,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.760
they often are becoming
more fragile over time.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.896
Which means that they're
the absolute worst places

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.856
to take your children on vacation,

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.776
because you can't do anything there.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.096
You can't climb the trees.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.336
You can't fish the fish.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.976
You can't make a campfire
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.656
You can't take home the pinecones.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.585
There are so many rules and restrictions

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:04.576
that from a child's point of view,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.400
this is, like, the worst nature ever.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.936
Because children don't want to hike

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.296
through a beautiful landscape
for five hours

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.176
and then look at a beautiful view.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.200
That's maybe what we want to do as adults,

00:09:16.224 --> 00:09:19.136
but what kids want to do
is hunker down in one spot

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.376
and just tinker with it,
just work with it,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.960
just pick it up, build a house,
build a fort, do something like that.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.696
Additionally, these sort of Edenic places

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.976
are often distant from where people live.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.936
And they're expensive to get to.
They're hard to visit.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.736
So this means that they're
only available to the elites,

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.360
and that's a real problem.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.376
The Nature Conservancy
did a survey of young people,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.600
and they asked them, how often
do you spend time outdoors?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.656
And only two out of five
spent time outdoors

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.896
at least once a week.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.936
The other three out of five
were just staying inside.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.056
And when they asked them why,
what are the barriers to going outside,

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.056
the response of 61 percent was,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.160
"There are no natural areas near my home."

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.896
And this is crazy.
This is just patently false.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.896
I mean, 71 percent of people in the US

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.696
live within a 10-minute walk
of a city park.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.376
And I'm sure the figures
are similar in other countries.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.536
And that doesn't even count
your back garden,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.520
the urban creek, the empty lot.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.056
Everybody lives near nature.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.736
Every kid lives near nature.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.816
We've just somehow
forgotten how to see it.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.016
We've spent too much time
watching David Attenborough documentaries

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.696
where the nature is really sexy --

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.736
(Laughter)

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.696
and we've forgotten how to see the nature
that is literally right outside our door,

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.656
the nature of the street tree.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.456
So here's an example: Philadelphia.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.856
There's this cool elevated railway

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.296
that you can see from the ground,
that's been abandoned.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.736
Now, this may sound like the beginning
of the High Line story in Manhattan,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.056
and it's very similar, except they haven't
developed this into a park yet,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.616
although they're working on it.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.816
So for now, it's still this little
sort of secret wilderness

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.256
in the heart of Philadelphia,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.376
and if you know where the hole is
in the chain-link fence,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.456
you can scramble up to the top

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.296
and you can find this
completely wild meadow

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.480
just floating above
the city of Philadelphia.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.536
Every single one of these plants
grew from a seed

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.896
that planted itself there.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.856
This is completely autonomous,
self-willed nature.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.136
And it's right in the middle of the city.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.376
And they've sent people up there
to do sort of biosurveys,

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.840
and there are over 50
plant species up there.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.816
And it's not just plants.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.336
This is an ecosystem,
a functioning ecosystem.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.816
It's creating soil.
It's sequestering carbon.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.736
There's pollination going on.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.720
I mean, this is really an ecosystem.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.256
So scientists have started calling
ecosystems like these "novel ecosystems,"

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.856
because they're often
dominated by non-native species,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.616
and because they're just super weird.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.096
They're just unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.136
For so long, we dismissed
all these novel ecosystems as trash.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.576
We're talking about
regrown agricultural fields,

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.176
timber plantations that are not
being managed on a day-to-day basis,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.856
second-growth forests generally,
the entire East Coast,

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.016
where after agriculture moved west,
the forest sprung up.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.656
And of course, pretty much all of Hawaii,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.496
where novel ecosystems are the norm,

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.096
where exotic species totally dominate.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.536
This forest here has Queensland maple,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.400
it has sword ferns from Southeast Asia.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.216
You can make your own
novel ecosystem, too.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.456
It's really simple.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.976
You just stop mowing your lawn.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.576
(Laughter)

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.296
Ilkka Hanski was an ecologist in Finland,
and he did this experiment himself.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.896
He just stopped mowing his lawn,

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.456
and after a few years,
he had some grad students come,

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.976
and they did sort of
a bio-blitz of his backyard,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.256
and they found 375 plant species,

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.400
including two endangered species.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:54.016
So when you're up there
on that future High Line of Philadelphia,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.856
surrounded by this wildness,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.656
surrounded by this diversity,
this abundance, this vibrance,

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.936
you can look over the side

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.216
and you can see a local playground
for a local school,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.176
and that's what it looks like.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.216
These children have, that --

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.696
You know, under my definition,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.096
there's a lot of the planet
that counts as nature,

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.456
but this would be one of the few places
that wouldn't count as nature.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.856
There's nothing there except humans,
no other plants, no other animals.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.336
And what I really wanted to do

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.456
was just, like,
throw a ladder over the side

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.016
and get all these kids to come up with me
into this cool meadow.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.336
In a way, I feel like this is
the choice that faces us.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.960
If we dismiss these new natures
as not acceptable or trashy or no good,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.616
we might as well just pave them over.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.176
And in a world where
everything is changing,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.000
we need to be very careful
about how we define nature.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.856
In order not to steal it
from our children,

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.816
we have to do two things.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.680
First, we cannot define nature
as that which is untouched.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.936
This never made any sense anyway.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.456
Nature has not been untouched
for thousands of years.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.296
And it excludes most of the nature
that most people can visit

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.296
and have a relationship with,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.720
including only nature
that children cannot touch.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.976
Which brings me to the second thing
that we have to do,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.496
which is that we have to
let children touch nature,

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.016
because that which
is untouched is unloved.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.000
(Applause)

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.136
We face some pretty grim
environmental challenges on this planet.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.696
Climate change is among them.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.216
There's others too:
habitat loss is my favorite thing

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.936
to freak out about
in the middle of the night.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.296
But in order to solve them,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.056
we need people --
smart, dedicated people --

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.856
who care about nature.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.856
And the only way we're going to raise up
a generation of people

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.096
who care about nature

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.296
is by letting them touch nature.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.616
I have a Fort Theory of Ecology,

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.536
Fort Theory of Conservation.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.776
Every ecologist I know,
every conservation biologist I know,

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.696
every conservation professional I know,

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.920
built forts when they were kids.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.776
If we have a generation
that doesn't know how to build a fort,

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.976
we'll have a generation that doesn't
know how to care about nature.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.256
And I don't want
to be the one to tell this kid,

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.616
who is on a special program

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.096
that takes Philadelphia kids
from poor neighborhoods

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.536
and takes them to city parks,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.736
I don't want to be the one to tell him
that the flower he's holding

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.840
is a non-native invasive weed
that he should throw away as trash.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.936
I think I would much rather
learn from this boy

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.616
that no matter
where this plant comes from,

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.816
it is beautiful, and it deserves
to be touched and appreciated.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.056
Thank you.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:39.270
(Applause)
