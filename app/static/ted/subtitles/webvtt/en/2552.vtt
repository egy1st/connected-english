WEBVTT

00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:03.452
There's this fact that I love
that I read somewhere once,

00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:08.126
that one of the things that's contributed
to homo sapiens' success

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.493
as a species

00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:11.573
is our lack of body hair --

00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:14.021
that our hairlessness, our nakedness

00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:16.351
combined with our invention of clothing,

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:19.669
gives us the ability to modulate
our body temperature

00:00:19.693 --> 00:00:23.289
and thus be able to survive
in any climate we choose.

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:27.322
And now we've evolved to the point
where we can't survive without clothing.

00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:28.876
And it's more than just utility,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.221
now it's a communication.

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:33.053
Everything that we choose
to put on is a narrative,

00:00:33.077 --> 00:00:35.098
a story about where we've been,

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:36.714
what we're doing,

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:37.938
who we want to be.

00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:40.796
I was a lonely kid.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.652
I didn't have an easy time
finding friends to play with,

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.071
and I ended up making
a lot of my own play.

00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:48.902
I made a lot of my own toys.

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:50.565
It began with ice cream.

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.713
There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown,

00:00:53.737 --> 00:00:56.089
and they served ice cream
from behind the counter

00:00:56.113 --> 00:00:58.720
in these giant, five-gallon,
cardboard tubs.

00:00:58.744 --> 00:01:01.006
And someone told me --
I was eight years old --

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.730
someone told me that when
they were done with those tubs,

00:01:03.754 --> 00:01:05.968
they washed them out
and kept them in the back,

00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:07.946
and if you asked they would give you one.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.404
It took me a couple of weeks
to work up the courage,

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:11.579
but I did, and they did.

00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:14.916
They gave me one -- I went home
with this beautiful cardboard tub.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.336
I was trying to figure out what
I could do with this exotic material --

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.745
metal ring, top and bottom.

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:23.154
I started turning it over in my head,
and I realized, "Wait a minute --

00:01:23.178 --> 00:01:25.320
my head actually fits inside this thing."

00:01:25.344 --> 00:01:26.907
(Laughter)

00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:28.624
Yeah, I cut a hole out,

00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:30.167
I put some acetate in there

00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:31.905
and I made myself a space helmet.

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.082
(Laughter)

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:36.066
I needed a place to wear the space helmet,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.794
so I found a refrigerator box
a couple blocks from home.

00:01:38.818 --> 00:01:40.105
I pushed it home,

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:42.897
and in my parents' guest room closet,

00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:45.312
I turned it into a spaceship.

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:47.635
I started with a control panel
out of cardboard.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.457
I cut a hole for a radar screen

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:51.704
and put a flashlight
underneath it to light it.

00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:54.778
I put a view screen up,
which I offset off the back wall --

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:57.435
and this is where I thought
I was being really clever --

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.506
without permission, I painted
the back wall of the closet black

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.689
and put a star field,

00:02:01.713 --> 00:02:06.243
which I lit up with some Christmas lights
I found in the attic,

00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:08.204
and I went on some space missions.

00:02:09.214 --> 00:02:10.365
A couple years later,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.791
the movie "Jaws" came out.

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:15.061
I was way too young to see it,
but I was caught up in "Jaws" fever,

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:17.247
like everyone else in America at the time.

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.161
There was a store in my town
that had a "Jaws" costume in their window,

00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:23.753
and my mom must have overheard
me talking to someone

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:25.897
about how awesome
I thought this costume was,

00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:27.779
because a couple days before Halloween,

00:02:27.803 --> 00:02:31.938
she blew my freaking mind
by giving me this "Jaws" costume.

00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:34.765
Now, I recognize it's a bit of a trope

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:36.662
for people of a certain age to complain

00:02:36.686 --> 00:02:40.222
that kids these days have no idea
how good they have it,

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:42.291
but let me just show you a random sampling

00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:46.013
of entry-level kids' costumes
you can buy online right now ...

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:49.859
... and this is the "Jaws" costume
my mom bought for me.

00:02:49.883 --> 00:02:52.615
(Laughter)

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.890
This is a paper-thin shark face

00:02:55.914 --> 00:02:59.452
and a vinyl bib with the poster
of "Jaws" on it.

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:00.524
(Laughter)

00:03:00.548 --> 00:03:01.951
And I loved it.

00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:03.802
A couple years later,

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:06.643
my dad took me to a film
called "Excalibur."

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:08.709
I actually got him to take me to it twice,

00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:13.000
which is no small thing,
because it is a hard, R-rated film.

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:15.180
But it wasn't the blood
and guts or the boobs

00:03:15.204 --> 00:03:17.101
that made me want to go see it again.

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:18.283
They helped --

00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:19.309
(Laughter)

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:20.498
It was the armor.

00:03:20.522 --> 00:03:24.636
The armor in "Excalibur"
was intoxicatingly beautiful to me.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.277
These were literally knights
in shining, mirror-polished armor.

00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:33.478
And moreover, the knights in "Excalibur"
wear their armor everywhere.

00:03:33.502 --> 00:03:37.025
All the time -- they wear it at dinner,
they wear it to bed.

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.100
(Laughter)

00:03:38.124 --> 00:03:39.994
I was like, "Are they reading my mind?

00:03:40.018 --> 00:03:42.486
I want to wear armor all the time!"

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.525
(Laughter)

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.748
So I went back to my favorite material,

00:03:45.772 --> 00:03:47.321
the gateway drug for making,

00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:48.765
corrugated cardboard,

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.651
and I made myself a suit of armor,

00:03:51.675 --> 00:03:55.120
replete with the neck shields
and a white horse.

00:03:55.144 --> 00:03:56.410
Now that I've oversold it,

00:03:56.434 --> 00:03:58.460
here's a picture of the armor that I made.

00:03:58.484 --> 00:03:59.825
(Laughter)

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.299
(Applause)

00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:07.327
Now, this is only the first
suit of armor I made

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:08.695
inspired by "Excalibur."

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.972
A couple of years later,

00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:14.094
I convinced my dad to embark
on making me a proper suit of armor.

00:04:14.118 --> 00:04:15.763
Over about a month,

00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:20.081
he graduated me from cardboard
to roofing aluminum called flashing

00:04:20.105 --> 00:04:22.921
and still, one of my all-time favorite
attachment materials,

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:24.112
POP rivets.

00:04:24.136 --> 00:04:25.848
We carefully, over that month,

00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:28.446
constructed an articulated suit
of aluminum armor

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.631
with compound curves.

00:04:29.655 --> 00:04:32.560
We drilled holes in the helmet
so that I could breathe,

00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:35.631
and I finished just in time
for Halloween and wore it to school.

00:04:35.655 --> 00:04:37.809
Now, this is the one thing in this talk

00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:39.650
that I don't have a slide to show you,

00:04:39.674 --> 00:04:41.676
because no photo exists of this armor.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.063
I did wear it to school,

00:04:43.087 --> 00:04:45.691
there was a yearbook photographer
patrolling the halls,

00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:49.105
but he never found me, for reasons
that are about to become clear.

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.207
There were things I didn't anticipate

00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:55.602
about wearing a complete suit
of aluminum armor to school.

00:04:56.061 --> 00:04:58.822
In third period math,
I was standing in the back of class,

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:00.647
and I'm standing in the back of class

00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:02.867
because the armor did not
allow me to sit down.

00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:04.346
(Laughter)

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.820
This is the first thing
I didn't anticipate.

00:05:07.351 --> 00:05:09.866
And then my teacher looks at me
sort of concerned

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.882
about halfway through the class
and says, "Are you feeling OK?"

00:05:12.906 --> 00:05:15.152
I'm thinking, "Are you kidding?
Am I feeling OK?

00:05:15.176 --> 00:05:18.044
I'm wearing a suit of armor!
I am having the time of my --"

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.728
And I'm just about to tell her
how great I feel,

00:05:20.752 --> 00:05:23.145
when the classroom
starts to list to the left

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.886
and disappear down this long tunnel,

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.482
and then I woke up in the nurse's office.

00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:33.269
I had passed out from heat exhaustion,

00:05:33.293 --> 00:05:34.719
wearing the armor.

00:05:34.743 --> 00:05:35.894
And when I woke up,

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:39.063
I wasn't embarrassed about having
passed out in front of my class,

00:05:39.087 --> 00:05:41.686
I was wondering, "Who took my armor?
Where's my armor?"

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.900
OK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years,

00:05:43.924 --> 00:05:47.258
some colleagues and I get hired
to make a show for Discovery Channel,

00:05:47.282 --> 00:05:48.433
called "MythBusters."

00:05:48.457 --> 00:05:49.623
And over 14 years,

00:05:49.647 --> 00:05:52.821
I learn on the job how to build
experimental methodologies

00:05:52.845 --> 00:05:55.424
and how to tell stories
about them for television.

00:05:55.796 --> 00:05:57.499
I also learn early on

00:05:57.523 --> 00:06:00.382
that costuming can play a key role
in this storytelling.

00:06:00.406 --> 00:06:04.441
I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color

00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:07.488
and narrative clarity
to the stories we're telling.

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:10.694
And then we do an episode
called "Dumpster Diving,"

00:06:10.718 --> 00:06:12.985
and I learn a little bit more

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.440
about the deeper implications
of what costuming means to me.

00:06:16.464 --> 00:06:18.060
In the episode "Dumpster Diving,"

00:06:18.084 --> 00:06:20.039
the question we were trying to answer is:

00:06:20.063 --> 00:06:21.706
Is jumping into a dumpster as safe

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.706
as the movies would lead you to believe?

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.504
(Laughter)

00:06:25.528 --> 00:06:28.163
The episode was going to have
two distinct parts to it.

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:31.242
One was where we get trained
to jump off buildings by a stuntman

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.599
into an air bag.

00:06:32.623 --> 00:06:35.104
And the second was the graduation
to the experiment:

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.973
we'd fill a dumpster full of material
and we'd jump into it.

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:40.284
I wanted to visually separate
these two elements,

00:06:40.308 --> 00:06:41.465
and I thought,

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:45.173
"Well, for the first part we're training,
so we should wear sweatsuits --

00:06:45.197 --> 00:06:48.945
Oh! Let's put 'Stunt Trainee'
on the back of the sweatsuits.

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:50.313
That's for the training."

00:06:50.337 --> 00:06:53.702
But for the second part, I wanted
something really visually striking --

00:06:53.726 --> 00:06:56.204
"I know! I'll dress as Neo
from 'The Matrix.'"

00:06:56.228 --> 00:06:57.302
(Laughter)

00:06:57.326 --> 00:06:58.636
So I went to Haight Street.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.239
I bought some beautiful
knee-high, buckle boots.

00:07:01.263 --> 00:07:03.705
I found a long, flowing coat on eBay.

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.450
I got sunglasses, which I had to wear
contact lenses in order to wear.

00:07:07.474 --> 00:07:09.454
The day of the experiment shoot comes up,

00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:11.446
and I step out of my car in this costume,

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.120
and my crew takes a look at me ...

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.399
and start suppressing
their church giggles.

00:07:16.893 --> 00:07:19.987
They're like,
"(Laugh sound)."

00:07:20.011 --> 00:07:22.442
And I feel two distinct things
at this moment.

00:07:22.466 --> 00:07:24.163
I feel total embarrassment

00:07:24.187 --> 00:07:26.933
over the fact that
it's so nakedly clear to my crew

00:07:26.957 --> 00:07:29.599
that I'm completely
into wearing this costume.

00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:30.773
(Laughter)

00:07:31.328 --> 00:07:34.548
But the producer in my mind reminds myself

00:07:34.572 --> 00:07:36.999
that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo,

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:40.116
that flowing coat is going to look
beautiful behind me.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.290
(Laughter)

00:07:42.012 --> 00:07:43.883
Five years into the "MythBusters" run,

00:07:43.907 --> 00:07:46.563
we got invited to appear
at San Diego Comic-Con.

00:07:46.587 --> 00:07:49.983
I'd known about Comic-Con for years
and never had time to go.

00:07:50.007 --> 00:07:53.611
This was the big leagues --
this was costuming mecca.

00:07:53.635 --> 00:07:55.675
People fly in from all over the world

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:58.821
to show their amazing creations
on the floor in San Diego.

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.370
And I wanted to participate.

00:08:00.394 --> 00:08:03.456
I decided that I would put together
an elaborate costume

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.914
that covered me completely,

00:08:04.938 --> 00:08:08.557
and I would walk the floor
of San Diego Comic-Con anonymously.

00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:09.899
The costume I chose?

00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:11.073
Hellboy.

00:08:11.493 --> 00:08:12.644
That's not my costume,

00:08:12.668 --> 00:08:13.819
that's actually Hellboy.

00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:14.862
(Laughter)

00:08:14.886 --> 00:08:16.044
But I spent months

00:08:16.068 --> 00:08:18.908
assembling the most screen-accurate
Hellboy costume I could,

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:20.867
from the boots to the belt to the pants

00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:22.279
to the right hand of doom.

00:08:22.303 --> 00:08:25.694
I found a guy who made
a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest

00:08:25.718 --> 00:08:27.007
and I put them on.

00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:30.762
I even had contact lenses made
in my prescription.

00:08:30.786 --> 00:08:33.116
I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.769
and I can't even tell you
how balls hot it was in that costume.

00:08:37.793 --> 00:08:38.833
(Laughter)

00:08:38.857 --> 00:08:40.892
Sweating! I should've remembered this.

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:43.805
I'm sweating buckets
and the contact lenses hurt my eyes,

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:47.378
and none of it matters
because I'm totally in love.

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:48.552
(Laughter)

00:08:49.066 --> 00:08:52.629
Not just with the process of putting
on this costume and walking the floor,

00:08:52.653 --> 00:08:56.232
but also with the community
of other costumers.

00:08:56.256 --> 00:08:58.152
It's not called costuming at Cons,

00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:00.002
it's called "cosplay."

00:09:00.026 --> 00:09:02.550
Now ostensibly, cosplay means
people who dress up

00:09:02.574 --> 00:09:05.137
as their favorite characters
from film and television

00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:06.345
and especially anime,

00:09:06.369 --> 00:09:09.110
but it is so much more than that.

00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:12.195
These aren't just people
who find a costume and put it on --

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:13.616
they mash them up.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.100
They bend them to their will.

00:09:15.124 --> 00:09:18.916
They change them to be the characters
they want to be in those productions.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.856
They're super clever and genius.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.543
They let their freak flag fly
and it's beautiful.

00:09:23.567 --> 00:09:24.606
(Laughter)

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.781
But more than that,

00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:27.258
they rehearse their costumes.

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:28.758
At Comic-Con or any other Con,

00:09:28.782 --> 00:09:31.329
you don't just take pictures
of people walking around.

00:09:31.353 --> 00:09:32.508
You go up and say,

00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:34.984
"Hey, I like your costume,
can I take your picture?"

00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:37.804
And then you give them time
to get into their pose.

00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:39.498
They've worked hard on their pose

00:09:39.522 --> 00:09:42.142
to make their costume look
great for your camera.

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:44.656
And it's so beautiful to watch.

00:09:45.178 --> 00:09:46.609
And I take this to heart.

00:09:46.633 --> 00:09:48.139
At subsequent Cons,

00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:52.556
I learn Heath Ledger's shambling walk
as the Joker from "The Dark Knight."

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.630
I learn how to be a scary Ringwraith
from "Lord of the Rings,"

00:09:55.654 --> 00:09:57.715
and I actually frighten some children.

00:09:57.739 --> 00:09:59.639
I learned that "hrr hrr hrr" --

00:09:59.663 --> 00:10:01.800
that head laugh that Chewbacca does.

00:10:02.625 --> 00:10:05.599
And then I dressed up as
No-Face from "Spirited Away."

00:10:05.623 --> 00:10:09.074
If you don't know about "Spirited Away"
and its director, Hayao Miyazaki,

00:10:09.098 --> 00:10:10.549
first of all, you're welcome.

00:10:10.573 --> 00:10:11.723
(Laughter)

00:10:12.136 --> 00:10:15.576
This is a masterpiece,
and one of my all-time favorite films.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.943
It's about a young girl named Chihiro
who gets lost in the spirit world

00:10:19.967 --> 00:10:22.300
in an abandoned Japanese theme park.

00:10:22.324 --> 00:10:24.220
And she finds her way back out again

00:10:24.244 --> 00:10:26.560
with the help of a couple
of friends she makes --

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.074
a captured dragon named Haku

00:10:28.098 --> 00:10:30.362
and a lonely demon named No-Face.

00:10:30.386 --> 00:10:33.256
No-Face is lonely
and he wants to make friends,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.445
and he thinks the way to do it
is by luring them to him

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.539
and producing gold in his hand.

00:10:38.563 --> 00:10:40.314
But this doesn't go very well,

00:10:40.338 --> 00:10:43.155
and so he ends up going
on kind of a rampage

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:45.435
until Chihiro saves him,

00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:46.648
rescues him.

00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:49.616
So I put together a No-Face costume,

00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:52.988
and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.

00:10:53.012 --> 00:10:57.733
And I very carefully practiced
No-Face's gestures.

00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:01.371
I resolved I would not speak
in this costume at all.

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.434
When people asked to take my picture,

00:11:03.458 --> 00:11:05.083
I would nod

00:11:05.107 --> 00:11:07.528
and I would shyly stand next to them.

00:11:07.552 --> 00:11:09.218
They would take the picture

00:11:09.242 --> 00:11:11.956
and then I would secret out
from behind my robe

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.502
a chocolate gold coin.

00:11:13.526 --> 00:11:16.894
And at the end of the photo process,
I'd make it appear for them.

00:11:16.918 --> 00:11:19.627
Ah, ah ah! -- like that.

00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.034
And people were freaking out.

00:11:21.058 --> 00:11:24.091
"Holy crap! Gold from No-Face!
Oh my god, this is so cool!"

00:11:24.115 --> 00:11:27.505
And I'm feeling and I'm walking
the floor and it's fantastic.

00:11:28.006 --> 00:11:30.783
And about 15 minutes in something happens.

00:11:31.368 --> 00:11:33.394
Somebody grabs my hand,

00:11:34.014 --> 00:11:36.092
and they put a coin back into it.

00:11:36.116 --> 00:11:39.312
And I think maybe they're giving me
a coin as a return gift,

00:11:39.336 --> 00:11:41.869
but no, this is one of the coins
that I'd given away.

00:11:42.229 --> 00:11:43.680
I don't know why.

00:11:43.704 --> 00:11:45.952
And I keep on going,
I take some more pictures.

00:11:45.976 --> 00:11:47.427
And then it happens again.

00:11:47.939 --> 00:11:51.150
Understand, I can't see anything
inside this costume.

00:11:51.174 --> 00:11:52.661
I can see through the mouth --

00:11:52.685 --> 00:11:54.304
I can see people's shoes.

00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:57.143
I can hear what they're saying
and I can see their feet.

00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:59.437
But the third time someone
gives me back a coin,

00:11:59.461 --> 00:12:01.119
I want to know what's going on.

00:12:01.612 --> 00:12:04.671
So I sort of tilt my head back
to get a better view,

00:12:04.695 --> 00:12:08.009
and what I see is someone walking
away from me going like this.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.773
And then it hits me:

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.233
it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face.

00:12:16.257 --> 00:12:18.169
In the film "Spirited Away,"

00:12:18.193 --> 00:12:21.590
bad luck befalls those
who take gold from No-Face.

00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:28.609
This isn't a performer-audience
relationship; this is cosplay.

00:12:29.855 --> 00:12:32.068
We are, all of us on that floor,

00:12:32.092 --> 00:12:35.425
injecting ourselves into a narrative
that meant something to us.

00:12:35.763 --> 00:12:37.608
And we're making it our own.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:41.732
We're connecting with something
important inside of us.

00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:46.092
And the costumes
are how we reveal ourselves

00:12:46.116 --> 00:12:47.299
to each other.

00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:49.140
Thank you.

00:12:49.164 --> 00:12:54.594
(Applause)
