WEBVTT

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.266
What do you do if you had
to figure out the information

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.691
behind 11.5 million documents,

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:07.611
verify it and make sense of it?

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.302
That was a challenge

00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:12.183
that a group of journalists
had to face late last year.

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:16.098
An anonymous person
calling himself John Doe

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:19.174
had somehow managed to copy
nearly 40 years of records

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:22.698
of the Panamanian law firm
Mossack Fonseca.

00:00:23.317 --> 00:00:26.007
This is one of many firms around the world

00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:29.562
that specialize in setting up accounts
in offshore tax havens

00:00:29.586 --> 00:00:31.586
like the British Virgin Islands,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.282
for rich and powerful people
who like to keep secrets.

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:39.733
John Doe had managed to copy
every spreadsheet from this firm,

00:00:39.757 --> 00:00:41.351
every client file,

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.074
every email,

00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:45.877
from 1977 to the present day.

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:49.227
It represented the biggest cache

00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:52.037
of inside information
into the tax haven system

00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:53.589
that anyone had ever seen.

00:00:54.092 --> 00:00:58.940
But it also presented a gigantic challenge
to investigative journalism.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.802
Think about it:
11.5 million documents,

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:08.425
containing the secrets of people
from more than 200 different countries.

00:01:08.449 --> 00:01:10.926
Where do you start
with such a vast resource?

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.029
Where do you even begin to tell a story

00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:15.644
that can trail off
into every corner of the globe,

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:19.412
and that can affect almost
any person in any language,

00:01:19.436 --> 00:01:21.863
sometimes in ways
they don't even know yet.

00:01:22.513 --> 00:01:25.015
John Doe had given the information
to two journalists

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.654
at the German newspaper
Süddeutsche Zeitung.

00:01:28.562 --> 00:01:31.796
He said he was motivated
by -- and I quote --

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.400
"The scale of the injustice
that the documents would reveal."

00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:38.384
But one user alone can never make sense

00:01:38.408 --> 00:01:40.338
of such a vast amount of information.

00:01:40.362 --> 00:01:42.224
So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out

00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:44.992
to my organization in Washington, DC,

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:48.387
The International Consortium
of Investigative Journalists.

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:52.500
We decided to do something
that was the very opposite

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:55.265
of everything we'd been taught
to do as journalists:

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.444
share.

00:01:56.468 --> 00:01:57.849
(Laughter)

00:01:58.324 --> 00:02:01.978
By nature, investigative
reporters are lone wolves.

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:03.831
We fiercely guard our secrets,

00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:05.389
at times even from our editors,

00:02:05.413 --> 00:02:08.273
because we know that the moment
we tell them what we have,

00:02:08.297 --> 00:02:10.177
they'll want that story right away.

00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:11.989
And to be frank,

00:02:12.607 --> 00:02:14.029
when you get a good story,

00:02:14.053 --> 00:02:16.457
you like to keep the glory to yourself.

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:20.342
But there's no doubt
that we live in a shrinking world,

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:23.535
and that the media has largely
been slow to wake up to this.

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.595
The issues we report on
are more and more transnational.

00:02:27.135 --> 00:02:29.863
Giant corporations operate
on a global level.

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.734
Environmental and health
crises are global.

00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:36.727
So, too, are financial flows
and financial crises.

00:02:37.488 --> 00:02:40.492
So it seems staggering
that journalism has been so late

00:02:40.516 --> 00:02:43.068
to cover stories in a truly global way.

00:02:43.783 --> 00:02:46.787
And it also seems staggering
that journalism has been so slow

00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:50.220
to wake up to the possibilities
that technology brings,

00:02:50.244 --> 00:02:52.248
rather than being frightened of it.

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:56.615
The reason journalists
are scared of technology is this:

00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:01.037
the profession's largest institutions
are going through tough times

00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.299
because of the changing way
that people are consuming news.

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.450
The advertising business models
that have sustained reporting are broken.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.548
And this has plunged
journalism into crisis,

00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:16.667
forcing those institutions
to reexamine how they function.

00:03:18.258 --> 00:03:19.911
But where there is crisis,

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:21.458
there is also opportunity.

00:03:22.013 --> 00:03:23.467
The first challenge presented

00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:26.339
by what would eventually become
known as the Panama Papers

00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:28.912
was to make the documents
searchable and readable.

00:03:28.936 --> 00:03:31.563
There were nearly five million emails,

00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:34.900
two million PDFs that needed
to be scanned and indexed,

00:03:34.924 --> 00:03:37.736
and millions more files
and other kinds of documents.

00:03:38.162 --> 00:03:40.999
They all needed to be housed
in a safe and secure location

00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:42.180
in the cloud.

00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:46.432
We next invited reporters
to have a look at the documents.

00:03:46.456 --> 00:03:50.316
In all, reporters from more
than 100 media organizations

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.983
in 76 countries --

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:54.478
from the BBC in Britain

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:56.718
to Le Monde newspaper in France

00:03:56.742 --> 00:03:59.130
to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:04.223
"Native eyes on native names,"
we called it, the idea being,

00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:07.606
who best to tell you
who was important to Nigeria

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.200
than a Nigerian journalist?

00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:11.748
Who best in Canada than a Canadian?

00:04:12.247 --> 00:04:15.303
There were only two rules
for everyone who was invited:

00:04:15.327 --> 00:04:19.509
we all agreed to share everything
that we found with everybody else,

00:04:20.335 --> 00:04:22.969
and we all agreed to publish
together on the same day.

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:25.804
We chose our media partners based on trust

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:29.046
that had been built up through
previous smaller collaborations

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.077
and also from leads
that jumped out from the documents.

00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:33.860
Over the next few months,

00:04:33.884 --> 00:04:36.542
my small nonprofit organization
of less than 20 people

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:40.999
was joined by more than 350 other
reporters from 25 language groups.

00:04:42.035 --> 00:04:43.957
The biggest information leak in history

00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:47.377
had now spawned the biggest
journalism collaboration in history:

00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:54.179
376 sets of native eyes doing
what journalists normally never do,

00:04:54.203 --> 00:04:55.814
working shoulder to shoulder,

00:04:55.838 --> 00:04:57.464
sharing information,

00:04:57.488 --> 00:04:58.905
but telling no one.

00:05:00.102 --> 00:05:01.701
For it became clear at this point

00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:04.082
that in order to make
the biggest kind of noise,

00:05:04.106 --> 00:05:07.291
we first needed
the biggest kind of silence.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.220
To manage the project
over the many months it would take,

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:13.061
we built a secure virtual newsroom.

00:05:13.085 --> 00:05:15.560
We used encrypted communication systems,

00:05:16.157 --> 00:05:18.847
and we built a specially
designed search engine.

00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:20.498
Inside the virtual newsroom,

00:05:20.522 --> 00:05:22.609
the reporters could gather
around the themes

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:24.614
that were emerging from the documents.

00:05:24.638 --> 00:05:29.944
Those interested in blood diamonds
or exotic art, for instance,

00:05:29.968 --> 00:05:33.158
could share information about how
the offshore world was being used

00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:35.389
to hide the trade in both
of those commodities.

00:05:35.413 --> 00:05:37.853
Those interested in sport
could share information

00:05:37.877 --> 00:05:41.142
about how famous sports stars
were putting their image rights

00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:42.690
into offshore companies,

00:05:42.714 --> 00:05:44.977
thereby likely avoiding taxes

00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:47.477
in the countries
where they plied their trade.

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:49.885
But perhaps most exciting of all

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:53.386
were the number of world leaders
and elect politicians

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.438
that were emerging from the documents --

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.549
figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine,

00:06:00.824 --> 00:06:04.350
close associates
of Vladimir Putin in Russia

00:06:05.852 --> 00:06:09.009
and the British Prime Minister,
David Cameron, who is linked

00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:11.350
through his late father, Ian Cameron.

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.760
Buried in the documents
were secret offshore entities,

00:06:15.784 --> 00:06:17.572
such as Wintris Inc.,

00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:20.303
a company in the British Virgin Islands

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:23.969
that had actually belonged
to the sitting Icelandic prime minister.

00:06:24.435 --> 00:06:26.846
I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson,

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.787
the Icelandic reporter
we invited to join the project,

00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:31.683
as the loneliest man in the world.

00:06:32.231 --> 00:06:34.520
For nine months, he refused paid work

00:06:34.544 --> 00:06:36.627
and lived off the earnings of his wife.

00:06:37.308 --> 00:06:39.391
He pasted tarps
over the windows of his home

00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:42.945
to prevent prying eyes
during the long Icelandic winter.

00:06:43.505 --> 00:06:47.303
And he soon ran out of excuses
to explain his many absences,

00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:48.893
as he worked red-eyed,

00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:50.123
night after night,

00:06:50.147 --> 00:06:51.384
month after month.

00:06:51.972 --> 00:06:54.320
In all that time, he sat on information

00:06:54.344 --> 00:06:57.587
that would eventually bring down
the leader of his country.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.789
Now, when you're an investigative reporter
and you make an amazing discovery,

00:07:01.813 --> 00:07:05.694
such as your prime minster can be linked
to a secret offshore company,

00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:09.844
that that company has a financial
interest in Icelandic banks --

00:07:09.868 --> 00:07:12.218
the very issue he's been elected on --

00:07:12.242 --> 00:07:14.892
well, your instinct
is to scream out very loud.

00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:18.938
Instead, as one of the few people
that he could speak to,

00:07:18.962 --> 00:07:21.913
Johannes and I shared
a kind of gallows humor.

00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:24.112
"Wintris is coming," he used to say.

00:07:24.136 --> 00:07:25.665
(Laughter)

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:27.686
(Applause)

00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:31.564
We were big fans of "Game of Thrones."

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.895
When reporters like Johannes
wanted to scream,

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:38.594
they did so inside the virtual newsroom,

00:07:38.618 --> 00:07:40.837
and then they turned
those screams into stories

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:43.979
by going outside the documents
to court records,

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:46.139
official company registers,

00:07:46.163 --> 00:07:50.208
and by eventually putting questions
to those that we intended to name.

00:07:51.178 --> 00:07:55.210
Panama Papers actually allowed
the reporters to look at the world

00:07:55.234 --> 00:07:57.850
through a different lens
from everybody else.

00:07:57.874 --> 00:07:59.794
As we were researching the story,

00:07:59.818 --> 00:08:01.236
unconnected to us,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.391
a major political bribery scandal
happened in Brazil.

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:07.954
A new leader was elected in Argentina.

00:08:08.608 --> 00:08:12.499
The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA,

00:08:12.523 --> 00:08:16.326
the organization that controls
the world of professional soccer.

00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:19.366
The Panama Papers
actually had unique insights

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.636
into each one of these unfolding events.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.100
So you can imagine the pressure
and the ego dramas

00:08:25.124 --> 00:08:27.613
that could have ruined
what we were trying to do.

00:08:27.637 --> 00:08:29.175
Any of one of these journalists,

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.920
they could have broken the pact.

00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:32.094
But they didn't.

00:08:32.464 --> 00:08:34.032
And on April 3 this year,

00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:36.237
at exactly 8pm German time,

00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:39.738
we published simultaneously
in 76 countries.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:47.203
(Applause)

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.252
The Panama Papers quickly became
one of the biggest stories of the year.

00:08:55.276 --> 00:08:58.480
This is the scene in Iceland
the day after we published.

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:00.648
It was the first of many protests.

00:09:01.047 --> 00:09:03.407
The Icelandic prime minister
had to resign.

00:09:03.431 --> 00:09:05.779
It was a first of many resignations.

00:09:06.275 --> 00:09:09.838
We spotlighted many famous people
such as Lionel Messi,

00:09:09.862 --> 00:09:12.190
the most famous
soccer player in the world.

00:09:12.726 --> 00:09:15.016
And there were some
unintended consequences.

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:19.131
These alleged members
of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested

00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:22.006
after we published details
about their hideout.

00:09:22.615 --> 00:09:24.555
They'd been using the address

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:26.549
to register their offshore company.

00:09:26.573 --> 00:09:29.368
(Laughter)

00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:33.652
There's a kind of irony
in what we've been able to do.

00:09:33.676 --> 00:09:37.382
The technology -- the Internet --
that has broken the business model

00:09:37.406 --> 00:09:39.960
is allowing us to reinvent
journalism itself.

00:09:40.516 --> 00:09:42.204
And this dynamic is producing

00:09:42.228 --> 00:09:45.068
unprecedented levels
of transparency and impact.

00:09:45.772 --> 00:09:49.258
We showed how a group of journalists
can effect change across the world

00:09:49.282 --> 00:09:53.262
by applying new methods
and old-fashioned journalism techniques

00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:55.690
to vast amounts of leaked information.

00:09:56.319 --> 00:10:00.571
We put all-important context
around what was given to us by John Doe.

00:10:01.205 --> 00:10:02.790
And by sharing resources,

00:10:02.814 --> 00:10:04.503
we were able to dig deep --

00:10:04.527 --> 00:10:08.902
much deeper and longer than most
media organizations allow these days,

00:10:08.926 --> 00:10:10.669
because of financial concerns.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.083
Now, it was a big risk,

00:10:13.107 --> 00:10:15.095
and it wouldn't work for every story,

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:17.123
but we showed with the Panama Papers

00:10:17.147 --> 00:10:20.085
that you can write about any country
from just about anywhere,

00:10:20.109 --> 00:10:23.623
and then choose your preferred
battleground to defend your work.

00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:25.770
Try obtaining a court injunction

00:10:25.794 --> 00:10:29.714
that would prevent the telling
of a story in 76 different countries.

00:10:30.377 --> 00:10:32.064
Try stopping the inevitable.

00:10:33.353 --> 00:10:37.083
Shortly after we published,
I got a three-word text from Johannes:

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.022
"Wintris has arrived."

00:10:40.046 --> 00:10:41.444
(Laughter)

00:10:41.468 --> 00:10:45.200
It had arrived and so, too, perhaps
has a new era for journalism.

00:10:45.673 --> 00:10:46.829
Thank you.

00:10:46.853 --> 00:10:53.807
(Applause)

00:10:57.612 --> 00:10:59.272
Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you.

00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:02.371
I guess you're going to send
that applause to the 350 journalists

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:03.973
who worked with you, right?

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.208
Now, a couple of questions
I would like to ask.

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:07.399
The first one is,

00:11:07.423 --> 00:11:10.091
you'd been working
in secrecy for over a year

00:11:10.115 --> 00:11:13.741
with 350-something colleagues
from all over the world --

00:11:13.765 --> 00:11:17.096
was there ever a moment when you thought

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.248
that the leak may be leaked,

00:11:19.272 --> 00:11:21.975
that the collaboration may just be broken

00:11:21.999 --> 00:11:23.578
by somebody publishing a story?

00:11:23.602 --> 00:11:26.420
Or somebody not in the group
releasing some information

00:11:26.444 --> 00:11:27.765
that they got to know?

00:11:28.228 --> 00:11:30.880
Gerard Ryle: We had a series
of crises along the way,

00:11:30.904 --> 00:11:33.635
including when something major
was happening in the world,

00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:36.682
the journalists from that country
wanted to publish right away.

00:11:36.706 --> 00:11:37.915
We had to calm them down.

00:11:37.939 --> 00:11:41.083
Probably the biggest crisis we had
was a week before publication.

00:11:41.107 --> 00:11:45.118
We'd sent a series of questions
to the associates of Vladimir Putin,

00:11:45.142 --> 00:11:46.635
but instead of responding,

00:11:46.659 --> 00:11:49.622
the Kremlin actually held
a press conference and denounced us,

00:11:49.646 --> 00:11:53.063
and denounced the whole thing
as being, I guess, a plot from the West.

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:56.103
At that point, Putin thought
it was just about him.

00:11:56.127 --> 00:11:58.631
And, of course, a lot of editors
around the world

00:11:58.655 --> 00:12:00.356
were very nervous about this.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.443
They thought the story
was going to get out.

00:12:02.467 --> 00:12:04.720
You can imagine the amount
of time they'd spent,

00:12:04.744 --> 00:12:06.903
the amount of resources,
money spent on this.

00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:09.964
So I had to basically spend
the last week calming everyone down,

00:12:09.988 --> 00:12:12.870
a bit like a general,
where you're holding your troops back:

00:12:12.894 --> 00:12:14.194
"Calm, remain calm."

00:12:14.218 --> 00:12:16.370
And then eventually,
of course, they all did.

00:12:17.323 --> 00:12:19.791
BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so,

00:12:19.815 --> 00:12:23.784
you released a lot of the documents
as an open database

00:12:23.808 --> 00:12:26.544
for everybody to search
via keyword, essentially.

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:28.194
GR: We very much believe

00:12:28.218 --> 00:12:30.620
that the basic information
about the offshore world

00:12:30.644 --> 00:12:31.797
should be made public.

00:12:31.821 --> 00:12:34.698
Now, we didn't publish
the underlying documents

00:12:34.722 --> 00:12:36.587
of the journalists we're working with.

00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:39.193
But the basic information
such as the name of a person,

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:42.141
what their offshore company was
and the name of that company,

00:12:42.165 --> 00:12:43.521
is now all available online.

00:12:43.545 --> 00:12:47.505
In fact, the biggest resource
of its kind basically is out there now

00:12:48.374 --> 00:12:50.247
BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do.

00:12:50.271 --> 00:12:51.429
GR: Thank you.

00:12:51.453 --> 00:12:54.966
(Applause)
