00:00:00.682 --> 00:00:03.721
I want to tell you
about the future of money.

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:07.064
Let's start with a story
about this culture

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:11.276
that lived in Micronesia
in the early 1900s, called the Yap.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.083
Now, I want to tell you about the Yap

00:00:13.107 --> 00:00:15.973
because their form of money
is really interesting.

00:00:15.997 --> 00:00:19.635
They use these limestone discs
called Rai stones.

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.386
Now, the Yap don't actually
move these Rai stones around

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.207
or exchange them the way
we do with our coins,

00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:29.696
because Rai stones can get
to be pretty massive.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.048
The largest is about four tons
and 12 feet across.

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:39.153
So the Yap just keep track
of who owns part of what stone.

00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.138
There's a story about these sailors

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.818
that were transporting a stone
across the ocean

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:48.668
when they ran into some trouble
and the stone actually fell in.

00:00:49.574 --> 00:00:51.896
The sailors got back to the main island

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.177
and they told everyone what had happened.

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:56.950
And everyone decided that, actually, yes,

00:00:56.974 --> 00:01:01.348
the sailors had the stone
and -- why not? -- it still counted.

00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:03.566
Even though it was
at the bottom of the ocean,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.745
it was still part of the Yap economy.

00:01:06.573 --> 00:01:09.742
You might think that this
was just a small culture

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.134
a hundred years ago.

00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:14.306
But things like this happen
in the Western world as well,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.689
and the Yap actually still use
a form of these stones.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.788
In 1932, the Bank of France
asked the United States

00:01:22.812 --> 00:01:26.376
to convert their holdings
from dollars into gold.

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:30.094
But it was too inconvenient
to think about actually shipping

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:32.047
all of that gold over to Europe.

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:35.904
So instead, someone went to where
that gold was being stored

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:39.982
and they just labeled it
as belonging to France now.

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:43.474
And everyone agreed
that France owned the gold.

00:01:43.843 --> 00:01:45.825
It's just like those Rai stones.

00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:48.838
The point I want to make
with these two examples

00:01:48.862 --> 00:01:52.250
is that there's nothing
inherently valuable

00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:55.635
about a dollar or a stone or a coin.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.782
The only reason these things
have any value

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.374
is because we've all decided they should.

00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:03.227
And because we've decided that,

00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:04.420
they do.

00:02:05.223 --> 00:02:09.363
Money is about the exchanges
and the transactions

00:02:09.387 --> 00:02:11.448
that we have with each other.

00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:14.850
Money isn't anything objective.

00:02:14.874 --> 00:02:19.271
It's about a collective story
that we tell each other about value.

00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:21.482
A collective fiction.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.053
And that's a really powerful concept.

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:27.526
In the past two decades,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.819
we've begun to use digital money.

00:02:29.843 --> 00:02:32.516
So I get paid via direct deposit,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.023
I pay my rent via bank transfer,

00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:36.991
I pay my taxes online.

00:02:37.015 --> 00:02:38.167
And every month,

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.956
a small amount of money
is deducted from my paycheck

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.947
and invested in mutual funds
in my retirement account.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.629
All of these interactions

00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:50.711
are literally just changing
1's and 0's on computers.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:55.109
There's not even anything physical,
like a stone or a coin.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.603
Digital money makes it
so that I can pay someone around the world

00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:01.008
in seconds.

00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:03.492
Now when this works,

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:08.361
it's because there are large institutions
underwriting every 1 or 0

00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:10.314
that changes on a computer.

00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:11.503
And when it doesn't,

00:03:11.527 --> 00:03:13.925
it's often the fault
of those large institutions.

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:16.892
Or at least, it's up to them
to fix the problem.

00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:18.476
And a lot of times, they don't.

00:03:18.862 --> 00:03:21.031
There's a lot of friction in the system.

00:03:21.938 --> 00:03:24.813
How long did it take
the US credit card companies

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:26.413
to implement chip and pin?

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:30.014
Half my credit cards
still don't work in Europe.

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:31.936
That's friction.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.472
Transferring money across borders
and across currencies

00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:38.140
is really expensive:

00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:40.268
friction.

00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:45.215
An entrepreneur in India
can set up an online business in minutes,

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.768
but it's hard for her
to get loans and to get paid:

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:50.666
friction.

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:56.545
Our access to digital money
and our ability to freely transact

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.512
is being held captive
by these gatekeepers.

00:03:59.536 --> 00:04:03.352
And there's a lot of impediments
in the system slowing things down.

00:04:04.498 --> 00:04:08.040
That's because digital money
isn't really mine,

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:11.638
it's entries in databases
that belong to my bank,

00:04:11.662 --> 00:04:14.815
my credit card company
or my investment firm.

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:18.203
And these companies
have the right to say "no."

00:04:18.856 --> 00:04:20.648
If I'm a PayPal merchant

00:04:20.672 --> 00:04:25.143
and PayPal wrongly flags me for fraud,

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:26.323
that's it.

00:04:26.347 --> 00:04:29.634
My account gets frozen,
and I can't get paid.

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.837
These institutions are standing
in the way of innovation.

00:04:37.946 --> 00:04:42.346
How many of you use
Facebook photos, Google Photos,

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.953
Instagram?

00:04:43.977 --> 00:04:46.323
My photos are everywhere.

00:04:46.347 --> 00:04:48.832
They are on my phone,
they're on my laptop,

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:51.372
they're on my old phone,
they're in Dropbox.

00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:54.228
They're on all these different
websites and services.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:58.156
And most of these services
don't work together.

00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:00.320
They don't inter-operate.

00:05:01.538 --> 00:05:03.031
And as a result,

00:05:03.055 --> 00:05:05.265
my photo library is a mess.

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:08.211
The same thing happens

00:05:08.235 --> 00:05:11.194
when institutions control
the money supply.

00:05:11.962 --> 00:05:14.697
A lot of these services
don't inter-operate,

00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:18.161
and as a result, this blocks
what we can do with payment.

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:20.735
And it makes transaction costs go up.

00:05:21.723 --> 00:05:25.025
So far, we've been through
two phases of money.

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:29.916
In an analog world, we had
to deal with these physical objects,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.819
and money moved at a certain speed --
the speed of humans.

00:05:34.896 --> 00:05:39.765
In a digital world, money can reach
much farther and is much faster,

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.819
but we're at the mercy
of these gatekeeper institutions.

00:05:43.222 --> 00:05:46.210
Money only moves at the speed of banks.

00:05:48.008 --> 00:05:50.562
We're about to enter a new phase of money.

00:05:51.158 --> 00:05:53.868
The future of money is programmable.

00:05:55.034 --> 00:05:58.461
When we combine software and currency,

00:05:58.485 --> 00:06:02.262
money becomes more
than just a static unit of value,

00:06:02.286 --> 00:06:05.476
and we don't have to rely
on institutions for security.

00:06:06.176 --> 00:06:07.705
In a programmable world,

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.663
we remove humans
and institutions from the loop.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.969
And when this happens,

00:06:13.993 --> 00:06:16.685
we won't even feel like
we're transacting anymore.

00:06:17.683 --> 00:06:19.957
Money will be directed by software,

00:06:19.981 --> 00:06:22.849
and it will just safely and securely flow.

00:06:24.828 --> 00:06:27.967
Cryptocurrencies are the first step
of this evolution.

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:30.442
Cryptocurrencies are digital money

00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:33.334
that isn't run by any government or bank.

00:06:33.358 --> 00:06:37.419
It's money designed to work
in a world without intermediaries.

00:06:38.153 --> 00:06:41.186
Bitcoin is the most ubiquitous
cryptocurrency,

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.907
but there are hundreds of them.

00:06:42.931 --> 00:06:46.408
There's Ethereum, Litecoin,
Stellar, Dogecoin,

00:06:46.432 --> 00:06:48.978
and those are just a few
of the more popular ones.

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:52.009
And these things are real money.

00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:54.362
The sushi restaurant down my street

00:06:54.386 --> 00:06:55.541
takes Bitcoin.

00:06:55.966 --> 00:07:00.091
I have an app on my phone
that I can use to buy sashimi.

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:03.429
But it's not just for small transactions.

00:07:03.453 --> 00:07:08.282
In March, there was a transaction
that moved around 100,000 bitcoins.

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:11.711
That's the equivalent
of 40 million US dollars.

00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:16.976
Cryptocurrencies are based on
a special field of mathematics

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.383
called cryptography.

00:07:19.023 --> 00:07:22.794
Cryptography is the study
of how to secure communication,

00:07:22.818 --> 00:07:25.517
and it's about two
really important things:

00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:29.119
masking information so it can
be hidden in plain sight,

00:07:29.143 --> 00:07:32.370
and verifying a piece
of information's source.

00:07:33.154 --> 00:07:37.363
Cryptography underpins
so many of the systems around us.

00:07:37.387 --> 00:07:39.913
And it's so powerful that at times

00:07:39.937 --> 00:07:43.589
the US government has actually
classified it as a weapon.

00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:49.068
During World War II,
breaking cryptosystems like Enigma

00:07:49.092 --> 00:07:52.396
was critical to decoding
enemy transmissions

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.324
and turning the tide of the war.

00:07:55.118 --> 00:07:58.412
Today, anyone with a modern
web browser is running

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.498
a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.991
It's what we use to secure
our interactions on the Internet.

00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:08.176
It's what makes it safe for us
to type our passwords in

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.891
and to send financial
information to websites.

00:08:11.322 --> 00:08:14.149
So what the banks used to give us --

00:08:14.173 --> 00:08:16.393
trustworthy digital money transfer --

00:08:16.417 --> 00:08:20.635
we can now get with a clever
application of cryptography.

00:08:21.202 --> 00:08:24.109
And this means that we don't
have to rely on the banks anymore

00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:25.764
to secure our transactions.

00:08:26.248 --> 00:08:28.077
We can do it ourselves.

00:08:28.857 --> 00:08:33.596
Bitcoin is based on the very same
idea that the Yap used,

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.922
this collective global
knowledge of transfers.

00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:41.464
In Bitcoin, I spend
by transferring Bitcoin,

00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:44.659
and I get paid when someone
transfers Bitcoin to me.

00:08:46.313 --> 00:08:49.068
Imagine that we had this magic paper.

00:08:49.711 --> 00:08:53.299
So the way that this paper works
is I can give you a sheet of it

00:08:53.323 --> 00:08:55.053
and if you write something on it,

00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:57.700
it will magically appear
on my piece as well.

00:08:58.721 --> 00:09:01.567
Let's say we just give everyone this paper

00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:05.419
and everyone writes down
the transfers that they're doing

00:09:05.443 --> 00:09:06.899
in the Bitcoin system.

00:09:07.688 --> 00:09:11.634
All of these transfers get copied
around to everyone else's pieces of paper.

00:09:11.658 --> 00:09:13.676
And I can look at mine

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.225
and I'll have a list of all
of the transfers that are happening

00:09:17.249 --> 00:09:19.138
in the entire Bitcoin economy.

00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:23.341
This is actually what's happening
with the Bitcoin blockchain,

00:09:23.365 --> 00:09:27.161
which is a list of all
of the transactions in Bitcoin.

00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:29.999
Except, it's not done through paper.

00:09:30.023 --> 00:09:31.719
It's done through computer code,

00:09:31.743 --> 00:09:34.406
running on thousands
of networked computers

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.638
around the world.

00:09:37.235 --> 00:09:40.979
All of these computers
are collectively confirming

00:09:41.003 --> 00:09:42.887
who owns what Bitcoin.

00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:46.324
So the Bitcoin blockchain
is core to how Bitcoin works.

00:09:46.348 --> 00:09:49.253
But where do bitcoins actually come from?

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.790
Well, the code is designed
to create new Bitcoin

00:09:53.814 --> 00:09:55.111
according to a schedule.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.096
And the way that it works
is that to get those Bitcoin,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.906
I have to solve a puzzle --
a random cryptographic puzzle.

00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:07.480
Imagine that we had 15 dice,

00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:10.117
and we were throwing these dice
over and over again.

00:10:10.603 --> 00:10:13.035
Whenever the dice come up all sixes,

00:10:13.059 --> 00:10:14.274
we say that we win.

00:10:15.095 --> 00:10:18.971
This is very close to what these computers
are all actually doing.

00:10:18.995 --> 00:10:22.243
They're trying over and over again
to land on the right number.

00:10:22.686 --> 00:10:24.043
And when they do,

00:10:24.067 --> 00:10:26.268
we say that they've solved the puzzle.

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:29.999
The computer that solves the puzzle

00:10:30.023 --> 00:10:32.941
publishes its solution
to the rest of the network

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:35.892
and collects its reward: new bitcoins.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.984
And in the act of solving this puzzle,

00:10:39.008 --> 00:10:43.084
these computers are actually
helping to secure the Bitcoin blockchain

00:10:43.108 --> 00:10:45.189
and add to the list of transactions.

00:10:45.866 --> 00:10:51.483
There are actually people
all over the world running this software,

00:10:51.507 --> 00:10:53.580
and we call them Bitcoin miners.

00:10:54.438 --> 00:10:57.174
Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner.

00:10:57.626 --> 00:11:00.417
You can go download the software right now

00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:03.806
and run it in your computer
and try to collect some bitcoins.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.244
I can't say that I would recommend it,

00:11:06.268 --> 00:11:11.369
because right now, the puzzle is so hard
and the network is so powerful,

00:11:11.393 --> 00:11:14.322
that if I tried to mine
Bitcoin on my laptop,

00:11:14.346 --> 00:11:17.654
I probably wouldn't see any
for about two million years.

00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:22.643
The miners, professional miners,
use this special hardware

00:11:22.667 --> 00:11:25.402
that's designed to solve
the puzzle really fast.

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:29.818
Now, the Bitcoin network
and all of this special hardware,

00:11:29.842 --> 00:11:32.877
there are estimates
that the amount of energy it uses

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:35.268
is equivalent to that of a small country.

00:11:36.252 --> 00:11:38.752
So, the first set of cryptocurrencies

00:11:38.776 --> 00:11:41.750
are a little bit slow
and a little bit cumbersome.

00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:46.720
But the next generation is going
to be so much better and so much faster.

00:11:46.744 --> 00:11:49.149
Cryptocurrencies are the first step

00:11:49.173 --> 00:11:52.633
to a world with a global
programmable money.

00:11:53.634 --> 00:11:55.719
And in a world with programmable money,

00:11:56.431 --> 00:11:59.958
I can pay anyone else securely

00:11:59.982 --> 00:12:03.555
without having to sign up
or ask permission,

00:12:03.579 --> 00:12:07.398
or do a conversion or worry
about my money getting stuck.

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:11.022
And I can send money around the world.

00:12:11.482 --> 00:12:13.881
This is a really amazing thing.

00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:17.540
It's the idea of permission-less innovation.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:23.171
The Internet caused
an explosion of innovation,

00:12:23.195 --> 00:12:26.654
because it was built upon
an open architecture.

00:12:27.286 --> 00:12:30.311
And just like the Internet
changed the way we communicate,

00:12:31.104 --> 00:12:34.380
programmable money is going
to change the way we pay,

00:12:34.404 --> 00:12:36.978
allocate and decide on value.

00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:40.214
So what kind of world
does programmable money create?

00:12:40.238 --> 00:12:44.454
Imagine a world where I can
rent out my healthcare data

00:12:44.478 --> 00:12:46.048
to a pharmaceutical company.

00:12:47.063 --> 00:12:49.568
They can run large-scale data analysis

00:12:49.592 --> 00:12:51.964
and provide me with a cryptographic proof

00:12:51.988 --> 00:12:56.114
that shows they're only using my data
in a way that we agreed.

00:12:56.138 --> 00:12:58.386
And they can pay me
for what they find out.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.238
Instead of signing up
for streaming services

00:13:02.262 --> 00:13:03.831
and getting a cable bill,

00:13:03.855 --> 00:13:06.861
what if my television analyzed
my watching habits

00:13:06.885 --> 00:13:10.557
and recommended well-priced content
that fit within my budget

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:11.780
that I would enjoy?

00:13:12.604 --> 00:13:15.470
Imagine an Internet without ads,

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:19.501
because instead of paying
with our attention when we view content,

00:13:19.525 --> 00:13:20.821
we just pay.

00:13:21.831 --> 00:13:24.142
Interestingly, things like micro-payments

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:27.321
are actually going to change
the way security works in our world,

00:13:27.345 --> 00:13:30.040
because once we're better able
to allocate value,

00:13:30.064 --> 00:13:33.088
people will use their money
and their energies

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:35.290
for more constructive things.

00:13:35.727 --> 00:13:38.316
If it cost a fraction of a cent
to send an email,

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.802
would we still have spam?

00:13:40.674 --> 00:13:42.877
We're not at this world yet,

00:13:42.901 --> 00:13:44.358
but it's coming.

00:13:44.382 --> 00:13:48.719
Right now, it's like we're in a world
that is seeing the first automobile.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:52.564
The first cryptocurrency,
like the first car,

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:57.260
is slow and hard to understand
and hard to use.

00:13:58.095 --> 00:14:00.641
Digital money,
like the horse and carriage,

00:14:00.665 --> 00:14:02.195
works pretty well,

00:14:02.219 --> 00:14:05.264
and the whole world economy
is built on it.

00:14:06.386 --> 00:14:08.460
If you were the first person on your block

00:14:08.484 --> 00:14:11.255
to get a car with an internal
combustion engine,

00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:13.777
your neighbors would probably
think you were crazy:

00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:16.794
"Why would you want
this large, clunky machine

00:14:16.818 --> 00:14:19.723
that breaks down all the time,
that lights on fire,

00:14:19.747 --> 00:14:22.084
and is still slower than a horse?"

00:14:22.928 --> 00:14:25.139
But we all know how that story turns out.

00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:30.001
We're entering a new era
of programmable money.

00:14:30.025 --> 00:14:33.076
And it's very exciting,
but it's also a little bit scary.

00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:38.205
Cryptocurrencies can be used
for illegal transactions,

00:14:38.229 --> 00:14:41.474
just like cash is used for crime
in the world today.

00:14:42.497 --> 00:14:44.975
When all of our transactions are online,

00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:48.318
what does that mean for surveillance --
who can see what we do?

00:14:50.115 --> 00:14:53.202
Who's advantaged
in this new world and who isn't?

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:56.900
Will I have to start to pay for things
that I didn't have to pay for before?

00:14:57.372 --> 00:15:01.259
Will we all become slaves
to algorithms and utility functions?

00:15:03.114 --> 00:15:05.518
All new technology comes with trade-offs.

00:15:06.012 --> 00:15:09.901
The Internet brought us
a lot of ways to waste time.

00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:13.096
But it also greatly
increased productivity.

00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:15.237
Mobile phones are annoying

00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:18.245
because they make me feel
like I have to stay connected to work

00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:19.424
all the time.

00:15:19.448 --> 00:15:22.274
But they also help me stay connected
to friends and family.

00:15:23.274 --> 00:15:27.618
The new sharing economy
is going to eliminate some jobs.

00:15:28.165 --> 00:15:32.059
But it's also going to create
new, flexible forms of employment.

00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:34.527
With programmable money,

00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:39.503
we decouple the need
for large, trusted institutions

00:15:39.527 --> 00:15:41.820
from the architecture of the network.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:47.656
And this pushes innovation in money
out to the edges, where it belongs.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.774
Programmable money democratizes money.

00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:55.219
And because of this,
things are going to change and unfold

00:15:55.243 --> 00:15:57.234
in ways that we can't even predict.

00:15:58.488 --> 00:15:59.650
Thank you.

00:15:59.674 --> 00:16:03.638
(Applause)
