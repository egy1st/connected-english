00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:04.172
The most complex problems in our time

00:00:04.196 --> 00:00:07.142
can be solved with simple techniques,

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.729
if we are able to dream.

00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:15.952
As a child, I discovered
that creativity is the key

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:20.369
to cross from dreams to reality.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.883
I learned this from my grandmother,

00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:25.584
Dr. Ruth Tichauer,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.948
a Jewish refugee that settled
in the heart of the Andes.

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.418
That is how I grew up:

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:37.765
encouraged to see beyond any limitation.

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:42.406
So part of my education
included helping her

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.840
in remote, indigenous communities.

00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:48.089
I cherish those memories,

00:00:48.113 --> 00:00:53.883
because they helped me
to understand life outside the city,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.394
a life with a lot of possibilities,

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:01.283
without barriers, as language or culture.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.106
During those trips, my grandmother
used to recite a Kipling poem:

00:01:06.687 --> 00:01:10.272
"Something hidden. Go and find it.

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:12.954
Go and look behind the Mountains.

00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:16.733
Something lost behind the mountains.

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:20.494
Lost and waiting for you. Go!"

00:01:21.624 --> 00:01:24.915
In the coming years,
I became a medical student.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.523
One of every hundred
children born worldwide

00:01:31.547 --> 00:01:34.470
has some kind of heart disease.

00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:40.364
There's a part of this problem
I think I can solve --

00:01:40.388 --> 00:01:46.935
the part of this problem
I have spent my life working on.

00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:49.493
The problem starts

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:51.636
during pregnancy.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.617
The fetus needs to survive
inside the mother.

00:01:56.808 --> 00:02:00.819
Survival depends on communication

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:04.260
between the systemic
and the pulmonary blood.

00:02:04.994 --> 00:02:06.336
At the moment of birth,

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:09.307
this communication needs to stop.

00:02:10.474 --> 00:02:14.572
If it doesn't close, the baby
has a hole in the heart.

00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:19.620
It is caused by prematurity
and genetic conditions.

00:02:20.537 --> 00:02:23.532
But what we know today

00:02:23.556 --> 00:02:27.977
is that a lack of oxygen
is also one of the causes.

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.244
As you can see in the chart,

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:36.363
the frequency of this kind of hole

00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:39.347
dramatically increases with altitude.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:43.459
Video: (Baby crying)

00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:47.625
When you look at patients
with this condition,

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:49.906
they seem desperate to breathe.

00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:55.724
To close the hole, major surgery
used to be the only solution.

00:02:56.527 --> 00:03:01.518
One night, my friend Malte,
were camping in the Amazon region.

00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:08.561
The only thing that would not burn
in the fire was a green avocado branch.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:11.815
Then came a moment of inspiration.

00:03:12.513 --> 00:03:16.700
So we used the branch as a mold
for our first invention.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.104
The holes in children's hearts
can be closed with it.

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:24.763
A coil is a piece of wire
wrapped onto itself.

00:03:25.313 --> 00:03:28.736
It maybe doesn't look so fancy to you now,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.077
but that was our first successful attempt

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.529
to create a device for this major problem.

00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:40.808
In this video, we can see
how a very tiny catheter

00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:42.961
takes the coil to the heart.

00:03:43.393 --> 00:03:45.697
The coil then closes the hole.

00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:48.526
After that moment of inspiration,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.708
there came a very long time of effort

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.471
developing a prototype.

00:03:56.495 --> 00:04:02.084
In vitro and in vivo studies took
thousands of hours of work in the lab.

00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:06.910
The coil, if it works, can save lives.

00:04:08.202 --> 00:04:10.614
I returned from Germany to Bolivia,

00:04:10.638 --> 00:04:13.142
thinking that wherever we go,

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:16.514
we have the opportunity
to make a difference.

00:04:17.278 --> 00:04:21.778
With my wife and partner,
Dr. Alexandra Heath,

00:04:21.802 --> 00:04:23.468
we started to see patients.

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:27.793
After successfully treating
patients with our coil,

00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:30.282
we felt really enthusiastic.

00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:34.530
But we live in a place

00:04:34.554 --> 00:04:38.036
that is 12,000 feet high.

00:04:39.694 --> 00:04:40.869
And,

00:04:42.284 --> 00:04:47.343
the patients there need a special device
to solve their heart condition.

00:04:47.865 --> 00:04:50.328
The hole in altitude
patients is different,

00:04:50.352 --> 00:04:54.022
because the orifice
between the arteries is larger.

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.381
Most patients cannot afford
to be treated on time,

00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:00.586
and they die.

00:05:01.973 --> 00:05:05.592
The first coil could successfully treat

00:05:05.616 --> 00:05:09.792
only half of the patients in Bolivia.

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:13.978
The search started again.

00:05:14.942 --> 00:05:18.820
We went back to the drawing board.

00:05:19.574 --> 00:05:21.007
After many trials,

00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:26.054
and with the help of my grandmother's
indigenous friends in the mountains,

00:05:26.078 --> 00:05:28.150
we obtained a new device.

00:05:28.753 --> 00:05:34.607
For centuries, indigenous women
told stories by weaving complex patterns

00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:35.796
on looms,

00:05:36.262 --> 00:05:40.578
and an unexpected skill
helped us for the new device.

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:44.483
We take this traditional method of weaving

00:05:44.507 --> 00:05:48.477
and make a design made by a smart material

00:05:48.927 --> 00:05:50.776
that records shape.

00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:53.731
It seems this time,

00:05:53.755 --> 00:05:58.482
the weaving allows us
to create a seamless device

00:05:58.506 --> 00:06:00.279
that doesn't rust

00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:04.586
because it's made of only one piece.

00:06:05.427 --> 00:06:09.907
It can change by itself
into very complex structures

00:06:09.931 --> 00:06:13.872
by a procedure that took
decades to develop.

00:06:14.903 --> 00:06:17.722
As you can see, the device enters the body

00:06:17.746 --> 00:06:19.308
through the natural channels.

00:06:20.173 --> 00:06:23.463
Doctors have only to close
the catheter through the hole.

00:06:24.104 --> 00:06:26.948
Our device expands, places itself

00:06:26.972 --> 00:06:28.447
and closes the hole.

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:33.291
We have this beautiful delivery system

00:06:33.315 --> 00:06:35.359
that is so simple to use

00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:37.533
because it works by itself.

00:06:38.422 --> 00:06:42.573
No open surgery was necessary.

00:06:43.494 --> 00:06:49.748
(Applause)

00:06:52.006 --> 00:06:54.689
As doctors, we fight with diseases

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:58.771
that take a long time
and effort to heal -- if they do.

00:06:59.443 --> 00:07:02.076
This is the child from before,

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.756
after the procedure.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.399
As you can see --

00:07:05.423 --> 00:07:09.983
(Applause)

00:07:10.007 --> 00:07:13.106
As you can see,
once the device is in place,

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.929
the patient is 100 percent healed.

00:07:16.622 --> 00:07:18.051
From start to finish,

00:07:18.075 --> 00:07:22.041
the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes.

00:07:23.183 --> 00:07:27.754
That's very rewarding from the medical
and human point of view.

00:07:28.444 --> 00:07:34.987
We are so proud that some
of our former patients

00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:37.502
are part of our team --

00:07:38.643 --> 00:07:42.467
a team, thanks to added close interaction

00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:45.067
with patients that work with us.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.079
Together, we have only one idea:

00:07:49.103 --> 00:07:52.419
the best solutions need to be simple.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.685
We lost the fear
of creating something new.

00:07:57.523 --> 00:07:59.725
The path, it's not easy.

00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:03.292
Many obstacles arise all the time.

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:07.947
But we receive strength from our patients.

00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:11.447
Their resilience and courage

00:08:12.233 --> 00:08:14.297
inspire our creativity.

00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:18.258
Our goal is to make sure

00:08:18.282 --> 00:08:21.416
that no child is left behind,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.519
not because of cost or access.

00:08:27.367 --> 00:08:30.331
So we have to start a foundation

00:08:30.355 --> 00:08:32.799
with a one-to-one model.

00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:36.394
We will give one device for free

00:08:37.061 --> 00:08:40.688
to make sure that every child is treated.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.855
We are in many countries now,

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.752
but we need to be everywhere.

00:08:48.926 --> 00:08:51.907
This whole thing began

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:54.795
with one impossible idea

00:08:54.819 --> 00:08:57.714
as will continue it, really:

00:08:58.698 --> 00:09:03.118
No child is left behind.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.474
Muchas gracias.

00:09:05.498 --> 00:09:10.389
(Applause)
