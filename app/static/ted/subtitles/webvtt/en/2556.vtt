00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.376
So when I decided to create
an art piece in Manshiyat Naser,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.376
the neighborhood of the Cairo
garbage collectors in Egypt,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.216
I never thought this project would be

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.920
the most amazing human experience
that I would ever live.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.336
As an artist, I had
this humanist intention

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.736
of beautifying a poor
and neglected neighborhood

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.840
by bringing art to it and hopefully
shining light on this isolated community.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.616
The first time I heard about
this Christian Coptic community

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.056
was in 2009 when the Egyptian authorities
under the regime of Hosni Mubarak

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.880
decided to slaughter 300,000 pigs
using the pretext of H1N1 virus.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.496
Originally, they are pig breeders.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.696
Their pigs and other animals
are fed with the organic waste

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.696
that they collect on a daily basis.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.480
This event killed their livelihood.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.536
The first time I entered Manshiyat Naser,
it felt like a maze.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.256
I was looking for the St. Simon Monastery
on the top of the Muqattam Mountain.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.456
So you go right, then straight,
then right again, then left

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.176
to reach all the way to the top.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.616
But to reach there, you must dodge between
the trucks overpacked with garbage

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.216
and slalom between the tuk-tuks,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.440
the fastest vehicle to move around
in the neighborhood.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.176
The smell of the garbage
unloaded from those trucks was intense,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.576
and the noise of the traffic
was loud and overbearing.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.280
Add to it the din created by the crushers
in those warehouses along the way.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.360
From outside it looks chaotic,
but everything is perfectly organized.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.056
The Zaraeeb, that’s how
they call themselves,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.616
which means the pig breeders,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.016
have been collecting the garbage of Cairo

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.816
and sorting it in their own
neighborhood for decades.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.976
They have developed
one of the most efficient

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.296
and highly profitable systems
on a global level.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.936
Still, the place is perceived
as dirty, marginalized and segregated

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.040
because of their association
with the trash.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.936
So my initial idea
was to create an anamorphic piece,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.816
a piece that you can only see
from one vantage point.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.176
I wanted to challenge myself artistically
by painting over several buildings

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.336
and having it only fully visible
from one point on the Muqattam Mountain.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.936
The Muqattam Mountain
is the pride of the community.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.416
This is where they built
the St. Simon Monastery,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.560
a 10,000-seat cave church
that they carved into the mountain itself.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.256
So, the first time
I stood on top of the mountain

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.896
and I looked at the neighborhood,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.816
I asked myself, how on earth
will I convince all those owners

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.016
to let me paint on their buildings?

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.416
And then Magd came.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.816
Magd is a guide from the Church.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.936
He told me the only person I needed
to convince was Father Samaan,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.416
who is the leader of the community.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.656
But to convince Father Samaan,
I needed to convince Mario,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.736
who is a Polish artist
who moved to Cairo 20 years ago

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.576
and who created all the artwork
of the Cave Church.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.520
I am really grateful to Mario.
He was the key of the project.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.656
He managed to get me
a meeting with Father Samaan,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.416
and surprisingly, he loved the idea.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.696
He asked me about where I painted before

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.176
and how I will make it happen.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.400
And he was mainly concerned
by what I was going to write.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.896
In every work that I create,
I write messages

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.696
with my style of Arabic calligraphy.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.456
I make sure those messages are relevant
to the place where I am painting

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.100
but have this universal dimension,

00:03:14.124 --> 00:03:16.924
so anybody around the world
can relate to it.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.816
So for Manshiyat Naser,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.616
I decided to write in Arabic
the words of St. Athanasius of Alexandria,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.576
a Coptic bishop from the third century,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.176
who said: (Arabic),

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.456
which means in English,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.616
"Anyone who wants
to see the sunlight clearly

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.120
needs to wipe his eyes first."

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.576
It was really important for me

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.496
that the community
felt connected to the words.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.960
And for me this quote was perfectly
reflecting the spirit of the project.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.896
So Father Samaan blessed the project,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.880
and his approval brought
all the residents on board.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.936
Hundreds of liters of paint,
a dozen blue manual lifts,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.096
several trips back and forth to Cairo,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.256
a strong and solid team from France,
North Africa, Middle East and the US,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.736
and after a year of planning
and logistics, there we are,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.376
my team and some members
from the local community

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.896
creating a piece that will
spread over 50 buildings,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.816
some filling up the space
of the calligraphy

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.256
that I trace with colors.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.336
Here some blue, there some yellow,
there some orange.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.495
Some others carrying some sand bags

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.616
and putting them
on the top of the buildings

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.976
to hold those manual lifts,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.896
and some others assembling
and disassembling those same lifts

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.120
and moving them around
the different buildings.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.896
At the beginning of the project,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.576
I numbered all those
buildings on my sketch,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.096
and there was no real interaction
with the community.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.256
People didn’t get the point of all this.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.776
But fast enough, those building numbers
became family names.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.400
The first building
was the house of Uncle Ibrahim.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.176
Uncle Ibrahim is such
an enthusiastic person.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.256
He was always singing and making jokes,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.616
and his daughters and sons
saved me from his bull

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.096
who wanted to attack me
on the fourth floor.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.416
(Laughter)

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.736
Actually, the bull saw me from the window
and came out on the balcony.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.096
(Laughter)

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.320
Yeah.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.336
Uncle Ibrahim was always
hanging out on the balcony

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.336
and talking to me while I was painting.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.336
I remember him saying that he didn’t
go to the mountain for 10 years,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.176
and that he never takes a day off.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.976
He said that if he stopped working,
who will stop the garbage?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.416
But surprisingly,
at the end of the project,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.256
he came all the way to the mountain
to look at the piece.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.056
He was really proud
to see his house painted,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.840
and he said that this project
was a project of peace and --

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.600
sorry --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.560
(Applause)

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.600
Thank you.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.296
He said that it was a project
of peace and unity

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.040
and that it brought people together.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.896
So his perception
towards the project changed,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.816
and my perception towards
the community changed also,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.776
and towards what they do.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.416
All the garbage that everybody
is disgusted by is not theirs.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.936
They just work out of it.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.216
Actually, they don’t live in the garbage.
They live from the garbage.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.456
So I started doubting myself and wondering

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.256
what was the real purpose
of this whole project?

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.376
It was not about beautifying
a place by bringing art to it.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.456
It was about switching perception
and opening a dialogue

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.640
on the connection that we have
with communities that we don’t know.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.776
So day after day,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.176
the calligraphy circle was taking shape,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.256
and we were always excited to go back
on the mountain to look at the piece.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.416
And standing exactly at this point
every day made my realize

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.256
the symbolism behind
this anamorphic piece.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.456
If you want to see
the real image of somebody,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.440
maybe you should change your angle.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.256
There was doubts and difficulties,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.536
like fears and stress.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.736
It wasn't simple
to work in such environments,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.976
sometimes having pigs under you
while you paint

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.816
or climbing a stack of garbage
to reach a lift.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.176
But we all got over the fear
of the heights, the swinging lifts,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.456
the strength of the smell

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.616
and also the stress
of not finishing on time.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.880
But the kindness of all those people
made us forget everything.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.776
The building number 3 was the house
of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.056
In Egyptian, they have
this expression that says, "Ahsen Nas,"

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.616
which means "the best people."

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.896
They were the best people.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.056
We used to take our break
in front of their houses,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.456
and all the kids of the neighborhood

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.816
used to join us.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.176
I was impressed and amazed
by the kids of Manshiyat Naser.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.336
For the first few days, they were always
refusing anything we were offering them,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.416
even a snack or a drink.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.376
So I asked Aunty Fareeda, "Why is that?"

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.256
And she told me they teach
their kids to refuse anything

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.936
from somebody that they don't know

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.520
because maybe this person
needs it more than they do.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.896
So at this exact point I realized actually

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.056
the Zaraeeb community
was the ideal context

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.680
to raise the topic of perception.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.536
We need to question
our level of misconception

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.216
and judgment we can have as a society

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.680
upon communities
based on their differences.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.416
I remember how we got delayed
on Uncle Ibrahim's house

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.576
when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.176
were eating the sand bags
that hold the lifts.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.760
(Laughter)

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.576
The house of Uncle Bakheet
and Aunty Fareeda

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.256
was this kind of meeting point.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.135
Everybody used to gather there.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.096
I think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.736
when he said that was
a project of peace and unity,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.559
because I really felt
that people were coming together.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.496
Everyone was greeting us
with a smile, offering us a drink

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.536
or inviting us into their
own house for lunch.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.576
Sometime, you are
at the first level of a building,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.136
and somebody opens his window
and offers you some tea.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.616
And then the same thing happens
on the second floor.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.656
And you keep going all the way to the top.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.896
(Laughter)

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.376
(Applause)

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.856
I think I never drink as much tea
as I did in Egypt.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.696
(Laughter)

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.456
And to be honest with you,
we could have finished earlier,

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.656
but I think it took us three weeks
because of all those tea breaks.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.480
(Laughter)

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.056
In Egypt, they have another expression,
which is "Nawartouna,"

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.200
which means, "You brought light to us."

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.096
In Manshiyat Naser
they were always telling us this.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.256
The calligraphy, actually --

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.336
I used a white glow-in-the-dark paint
for the calligraphy

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.536
so at the end of the project,
we rented some black light projectors

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.936
and lit up the whole neighborhood,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.336
surprising everybody around.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.616
We wanted to tell them

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.840
that they are the ones
who brought light to us.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.560
(Applause)

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.056
The Zaraeeb community
are strong, honest, hard workers,

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.816
and they know their value.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.976
The people of Cairo
call them "the Zabaleen,"

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.976
which means "the people of the garbage,"

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.736
but ironically,
the people of Manshiyat Naser

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.616
call the people of Cairo the Zabaleen.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.576
They say, they are the ones
who produce the garbage, not them.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.816
(Laughter)

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.216
(Applause)

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.616
The goal was to leave something
to this community,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.776
but I feel that they are the ones
who left something in our lives.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.896
You know, the art project
was just a pretext

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.576
for this amazing human experience.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.016
The art piece at some point
will disappear, vanish,

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.936
and actually there is somebody
who is building a second floor

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.616
in front of Uncle Ibrahim's house,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.496
so it's covering part of the painting,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.656
so I might need to go back
and paint over it.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.296
(Laughter)

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.696
It was about the experience,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.136
about the story,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.440
about the moment.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.456
From the streets of the neighborhood,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.100
the painting appears in fragments,

00:10:48.124 --> 00:10:50.016
isolated from one another,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.296
standing alone.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.496
But connected with the sign of calligraphy

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.376
that today reveals the powerful message
that we should all think about

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.080
before we want to judge somebody.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.776
Anyone who wants to see
the sunlight clearly

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.240
needs to wipe his eyes first.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.176
Thank you.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:12.961
(Applause)
