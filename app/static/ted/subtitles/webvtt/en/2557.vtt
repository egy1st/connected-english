00:00:00.904 --> 00:00:02.309
Hello, everybody.

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.976
I brought with me today a baby diaper.

00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:08.515
You'll see why in a second.

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.549
Baby diapers have interesting properties.

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:13.264
They can swell enormously
when you add water to them,

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:16.272
an experiment done
by millions of kids every day.

00:00:16.296 --> 00:00:17.446
(Laughter)

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.964
But the reason why

00:00:18.988 --> 00:00:21.178
is that they're designed
in a very clever way.

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:23.837
They're made out of a thing
called a swellable material.

00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:26.598
It's a special kind of material that,
when you add water,

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:28.052
it will swell up enormously,

00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:30.242
maybe a thousand times in volume.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:33.502
And this is a very useful,
industrial kind of polymer.

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.345
But what we're trying to do
in my group at MIT

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:39.582
is to figure out if we can do
something similar to the brain.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:40.765
Can we make it bigger,

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:42.467
big enough that you
can peer inside

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:45.109
and see all the tiny building blocks,
the biomolecules,

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.284
how they're organized in three dimensions,

00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:50.793
the structure, the ground truth
structure of the brain, if you will?

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:51.975
If we could get that,

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.508
maybe we could have a better understanding
of how the brain is organized

00:00:55.532 --> 00:00:57.191
to yield thoughts and emotions

00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:58.934
and actions and sensations.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.373
Maybe we could try to pinpoint
the exact changes in the brain

00:01:02.397 --> 00:01:04.173
that result in diseases,

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:07.409
diseases like Alzheimer's
and epilepsy and Parkinson's,

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:10.011
for which there are few
treatments, much less cures,

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:13.652
and for which, very often,
we don't know the cause or the origins

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:15.811
and what's really causing them to occur.

00:01:16.613 --> 00:01:18.353
Now, our group at MIT

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:21.063
is trying to take
a different point of view

00:01:21.087 --> 00:01:24.317
from the way neuroscience has
been done over the last hundred years.

00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:25.920
We're designers. We're inventors.

00:01:25.944 --> 00:01:28.488
We're trying to figure out
how to build technologies

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:30.968
that let us look at and repair the brain.

00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:32.143
And the reason is,

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:34.968
the brain is incredibly,
incredibly complicated.

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:38.371
So what we've learned
over the first century of neuroscience

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:40.698
is that the brain is a very
complicated network,

00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:43.202
made out of very specialized
cells called neurons

00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:44.893
with very complex geometries,

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:49.154
and electrical currents will flow
through these complexly shaped neurons.

00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:52.437
Furthermore, neurons
are connected in networks.

00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:56.296
They're connected by little junctions
called synapses that exchange chemicals

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.538
and allow the neurons
to talk to each other.

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:00.502
The density of the brain is incredible.

00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:02.833
In a cubic millimeter of your brain,

00:02:02.857 --> 00:02:05.314
there are about 100,000 of these neurons

00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:07.855
and maybe a billion of those connections.

00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:10.269
But it's worse.

00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:12.598
So, if you could zoom in to a neuron,

00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:15.372
and, of course, this is just
our artist's rendition of it.

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:19.603
What you would see are thousands
and thousands of kinds of biomolecules,

00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:24.027
little nanoscale machines
organized in complex, 3D patterns,

00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:26.679
and together they mediate
those electrical pulses,

00:02:26.703 --> 00:02:30.640
those chemical exchanges
that allow neurons to work together

00:02:30.664 --> 00:02:34.333
to generate things like thoughts
and feelings and so forth.

00:02:34.357 --> 00:02:38.121
Now, we don't know how
the neurons in the brain are organized

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:39.319
to form networks,

00:02:39.343 --> 00:02:41.843
and we don't know how
the biomolecules are organized

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:43.041
within neurons

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:45.470
to form these complex, organized machines.

00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:47.738
If we really want to understand this,

00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:49.579
we're going to need new technologies.

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:51.387
But if we could get such maps,

00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:54.354
if we could look at the organization
of molecules and neurons

00:02:54.378 --> 00:02:55.944
and neurons and networks,

00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:59.405
maybe we could really understand
how the brain conducts information

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.596
from sensory regions,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.356
mixes it with emotion and feeling,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.774
and generates our decisions and actions.

00:03:05.131 --> 00:03:08.920
Maybe we could pinpoint the exact set
of molecular changes that occur

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:10.146
in a brain disorder.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.992
And once we know how
those molecules have changed,

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:15.796
whether they've increased in number
or changed in pattern,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.759
we could use those
as targets for new drugs,

00:03:18.783 --> 00:03:21.054
for new ways of delivering
energy into the brain

00:03:21.078 --> 00:03:24.958
in order to repair the brain
computations that are afflicted

00:03:24.982 --> 00:03:27.281
in patients who suffer
from brain disorders.

00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:31.036
We've all seen lots of different
technologies over the last century

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.226
to try to confront this.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.130
I think we've all seen brain scans

00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:36.188
taken using MRI machines.

00:03:36.212 --> 00:03:39.559
These, of course, have the great power
that they are noninvasive,

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:41.938
they can be used on living human subjects.

00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:44.638
But also, they're spatially crude.

00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:47.652
Each of these blobs that you see,
or voxels, as they're called,

00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:50.365
can contain millions
and millions of neurons.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.239
So it's not at the level of resolution

00:03:52.263 --> 00:03:54.801
where it can pinpoint
the molecular changes that occur

00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:57.111
or the changes in the wiring
of these networks

00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:01.081
that contributes to our ability
to be conscious and powerful beings.

00:04:01.797 --> 00:04:04.978
At the other extreme,
you have microscopes.

00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:08.297
Microscopes, of course, will use light
to look at little tiny things.

00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:11.396
For centuries, they've been used
to look at things like bacteria.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.571
For neuroscience,

00:04:12.595 --> 00:04:16.007
microscopes are actually how neurons
were discovered in the first place,

00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:17.323
about 130 years ago.

00:04:17.347 --> 00:04:19.665
But light is fundamentally limited.

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:22.987
You can't see individual molecules
with a regular old microscope.

00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:25.163
You can't look at these tiny connections.

00:04:25.187 --> 00:04:29.129
So if we want to make our ability
to see the brain more powerful,

00:04:29.153 --> 00:04:31.321
to get down to the ground truth structure,

00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:34.625
we're going to need to have
even better technologies.

00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:37.835
My group, a couple years ago,
started thinking:

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:39.271
Why don't we do the opposite?

00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:41.756
If it's so darn complicated
to zoom in to the brain,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.723
why can't we make the brain bigger?

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:45.321
It initially started

00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:48.341
with two grad students in my group,
Fei Chen and Paul Tillberg.

00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:51.085
Now many others in my group
are helping with this process.

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:53.871
We decided to try to figure out
if we could take polymers,

00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:55.524
like the stuff in the baby diaper,

00:04:55.548 --> 00:04:57.554
and install it physically
within the brain.

00:04:57.578 --> 00:04:59.819
If we could do it just right,
and you add water,

00:04:59.843 --> 00:05:01.678
you can potentially blow the brain up

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:05.079
to where you could distinguish
those tiny biomolecules from each other.

00:05:05.103 --> 00:05:07.973
You would see those connections
and get maps of the brain.

00:05:07.997 --> 00:05:09.985
This could potentially be quite dramatic.

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.017
We brought a little demo here.

00:05:13.538 --> 00:05:16.113
We got some purified baby diaper material.

00:05:16.137 --> 00:05:18.411
It's much easier
just to buy it off the Internet

00:05:18.435 --> 00:05:21.910
than to extract the few grains
that actually occur in these diapers.

00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:24.159
I'm going to put just one teaspoon here

00:05:24.706 --> 00:05:26.500
of this purified polymer.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.422
And here we have some water.

00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:30.608
What we're going to do

00:05:30.632 --> 00:05:33.643
is see if this teaspoon
of the baby diaper material

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.376
can increase in size.

00:05:36.687 --> 00:05:40.383
You're going to see it increase in volume
by about a thousandfold

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:41.693
before your very eyes.

00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:51.569
I could pour much more of this in there,

00:05:51.593 --> 00:05:53.151
but I think you've got the idea

00:05:53.175 --> 00:05:55.677
that this is a very,
very interesting molecule,

00:05:55.701 --> 00:05:57.613
and if can use it in the right way,

00:05:57.637 --> 00:05:59.958
we might be able
to really zoom in on the brain

00:05:59.982 --> 00:06:02.576
in a way that you can't do
with past technologies.

00:06:03.227 --> 00:06:05.281
OK. So a little bit of chemistry now.

00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:07.747
What's going on
in the baby diaper polymer?

00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:09.447
If you could zoom in,

00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.144
it might look something like
what you see on the screen.

00:06:12.168 --> 00:06:16.660
Polymers are chains of atoms
arranged in long, thin lines.

00:06:16.684 --> 00:06:18.051
The chains are very tiny,

00:06:18.075 --> 00:06:19.939
about the width of a biomolecule,

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.710
and these polymers are really dense.

00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:23.234
They're separated by distances

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.510
that are around the size of a biomolecule.

00:06:25.534 --> 00:06:26.699
This is very good

00:06:26.723 --> 00:06:29.764
because we could potentially
move everything apart in the brain.

00:06:29.788 --> 00:06:31.636
If we add water, what will happen is,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.175
this swellable material
is going to absorb the water,

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.599
the polymer chains will move
apart from each other,

00:06:36.623 --> 00:06:39.257
and the entire material
is going to become bigger.

00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:41.429
And because these chains are so tiny

00:06:41.453 --> 00:06:43.658
and spaced by biomolecular distances,

00:06:43.682 --> 00:06:45.721
we could potentially blow up the brain

00:06:45.745 --> 00:06:47.378
and make it big enough to see.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.260
Here's the mystery, then:

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:52.894
How do we actually make
these polymer chains inside the brain

00:06:52.918 --> 00:06:55.157
so we can move all the biomolecules apart?

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.332
If we could do that,

00:06:56.356 --> 00:06:58.753
maybe we could get
ground truth maps of the brain.

00:06:58.777 --> 00:07:00.166
We could look at the wiring.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.347
We can peer inside
and see the molecules within.

00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:06.406
To explain this, we made some animations

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.033
where we actually look
at, in these artist renderings,

00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:12.598
what biomolecules might look
like and how we might separate them.

00:07:12.622 --> 00:07:15.171
Step one: what we'd have
to do, first of all,

00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:18.584
is attach every biomolecule,
shown in brown here,

00:07:18.608 --> 00:07:20.767
to a little anchor, a little handle.

00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:23.886
We need to pull the molecules
of the brain apart from each other,

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.236
and to do that, we need
to have a little handle

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.545
that allows those polymers to bind to them

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:30.111
and to exert their force.

00:07:31.278 --> 00:07:34.439
Now, if you just take baby diaper
polymer and dump it on the brain,

00:07:34.463 --> 00:07:36.500
obviously, it's going to sit there on top.

00:07:36.524 --> 00:07:39.052
So we need to find a way
to make the polymers inside.

00:07:39.076 --> 00:07:40.864
And this is where we're really lucky.

00:07:40.888 --> 00:07:43.076
It turns out, you can
get the building blocks,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.472
monomers, as they're called,

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:46.280
and if you let them go into the brain

00:07:46.304 --> 00:07:48.340
and then trigger the chemical reactions,

00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:51.066
you can get them to form
those long chains,

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.888
right there inside the brain tissue.

00:07:53.325 --> 00:07:55.722
They're going to wind their way
around biomolecules

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:56.967
and between biomolecules,

00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:58.616
forming those complex webs

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.502
that will allow you, eventually,
to pull apart the molecules

00:08:01.526 --> 00:08:02.701
from each other.

00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:05.779
And every time one
of those little handles is around,

00:08:05.803 --> 00:08:09.153
the polymer will bind to the handle,
and that's exactly what we need

00:08:09.177 --> 00:08:11.708
in order to pull the molecules
apart from each other.

00:08:11.732 --> 00:08:13.425
All right, the moment of truth.

00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:15.597
We have to treat this specimen

00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:19.067
with a chemical to kind of loosen up
all the molecules from each other,

00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:20.927
and then, when we add water,

00:08:20.951 --> 00:08:23.904
that swellable material is going
to start absorbing the water,

00:08:23.928 --> 00:08:25.631
the polymer chains will move apart,

00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:28.377
but now, the biomolecules
will come along for the ride.

00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:30.565
And much like drawing
a picture on a balloon,

00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:32.176
and then you blow up the balloon,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.490
the image is the same,

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:36.062
but the ink particles have moved
away from each other.

00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:39.553
And that's what we've been able
to do now, but in three dimensions.

00:08:39.577 --> 00:08:41.576
There's one last trick.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.818
As you can see here,

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:44.951
we've color-coded
all the biomolecules brown.

00:08:44.975 --> 00:08:47.145
That's because they all
kind of look the same.

00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:49.274
Biomolecules are made
out of the same atoms,

00:08:49.298 --> 00:08:51.538
but just in different orders.

00:08:51.562 --> 00:08:53.062
So we need one last thing

00:08:53.086 --> 00:08:54.781
in order to make them visible.

00:08:54.805 --> 00:08:56.384
We have to bring in little tags,

00:08:56.408 --> 00:08:59.427
with glowing dyes
that will distinguish them.

00:08:59.451 --> 00:09:02.124
So one kind of biomolecule
might get a blue color.

00:09:02.148 --> 00:09:04.499
Another kind of biomolecule
might get a red color.

00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:05.799
And so forth.

00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:07.375
And that's the final step.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.677
Now we can look at something like a brain

00:09:09.701 --> 00:09:11.497
and look at the individual molecules,

00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.228
because we've moved them
far apart enough from each other

00:09:14.252 --> 00:09:15.950
that we can tell them apart.

00:09:15.974 --> 00:09:18.808
So the hope here is that
we can make the invisible visible.

00:09:18.832 --> 00:09:21.398
We can turn things that might seem
small and obscure

00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:22.573
and blow them up

00:09:22.597 --> 00:09:25.774
until they're like constellations
of information about life.

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:28.173
Here's an actual video
of what it might look like.

00:09:28.197 --> 00:09:30.568
We have here a little brain in a dish --

00:09:30.592 --> 00:09:32.339
a little piece of a brain, actually.

00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:33.959
We've infused the polymer in,

00:09:33.983 --> 00:09:35.450
and now we're adding water.

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:37.832
What you'll see is that,
right before your eyes --

00:09:37.856 --> 00:09:39.779
this video is sped up about sixtyfold --

00:09:39.803 --> 00:09:42.528
this little piece of brain tissue
is going to grow.

00:09:42.552 --> 00:09:45.732
It can increase by a hundredfold
or even more in volume.

00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:48.705
And the cool part is, because
those polymers are so tiny,

00:09:48.729 --> 00:09:51.288
we're separating biomolecules
evenly from each other.

00:09:51.312 --> 00:09:52.970
It's a smooth expansion.

00:09:52.994 --> 00:09:55.681
We're not losing the configuration
of the information.

00:09:55.705 --> 00:09:58.405
We're just making it easier to see.

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:01.509
So now we can take
actual brain circuitry --

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:04.667
here's a piece of the brain
involved with, for example, memory --

00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:05.954
and we can zoom in.

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:08.868
We can start to actually look at
how circuits are configured.

00:10:08.892 --> 00:10:10.860
Maybe someday we could read out a memory.

00:10:10.884 --> 00:10:13.663
Maybe we could actually look
at how circuits are configured

00:10:13.687 --> 00:10:14.839
to process emotions,

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:17.785
how the actual wiring
of our brain is organized

00:10:17.809 --> 00:10:20.376
in order to make us who we are.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.447
And of course, we can pinpoint, hopefully,

00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:25.630
the actual problems in the brain
at a molecular level.

00:10:25.654 --> 00:10:28.223
What if we could actually
look into cells in the brain

00:10:28.247 --> 00:10:31.330
and figure out, wow, here are the 17
molecules that have altered

00:10:31.354 --> 00:10:34.809
in this brain tissue that has been
undergoing epilepsy

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:36.483
or changing in Parkinson's disease

00:10:36.507 --> 00:10:38.024
or otherwise being altered?

00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:41.091
If we get that systematic list
of things that are going wrong,

00:10:41.115 --> 00:10:43.314
those become our therapeutic targets.

00:10:43.338 --> 00:10:45.015
We can build drugs that bind those.

00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:47.666
We can maybe aim energy
at different parts of the brain

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.377
in order to help people
with Parkinson's or epilepsy

00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:52.952
or other conditions that affect
over a billion people

00:10:52.976 --> 00:10:54.189
around the world.

00:10:55.246 --> 00:10:57.452
Now, something interesting
has been happening.

00:10:57.476 --> 00:11:00.181
It turns out that throughout biomedicine,

00:11:00.205 --> 00:11:02.871
there are other problems
that expansion might help with.

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:06.129
This is an actual biopsy
from a human breast cancer patient.

00:11:06.505 --> 00:11:08.693
It turns out that if you look at cancers,

00:11:08.717 --> 00:11:10.328
if you look at the immune system,

00:11:10.352 --> 00:11:12.865
if you look at aging,
if you look at development --

00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:17.386
all these processes are involving
large-scale biological systems.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.434
But of course, the problems begin
with those little nanoscale molecules,

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:25.327
the machines that make the cells
and the organs in our body tick.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.573
So what we're trying
to do now is to figure out

00:11:27.597 --> 00:11:31.063
if we can actually use this technology
to map the building blocks of life

00:11:31.087 --> 00:11:32.832
in a wide variety of diseases.

00:11:32.856 --> 00:11:35.752
Can we actually pinpoint
the molecular changes in a tumor

00:11:35.776 --> 00:11:38.145
so that we can actually
go after it in a smart way

00:11:38.169 --> 00:11:42.113
and deliver drugs that might wipe out
exactly the cells that we want to?

00:11:42.137 --> 00:11:44.472
You know, a lot of medicine
is very high risk.

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.278
Sometimes, it's even guesswork.

00:11:46.626 --> 00:11:50.501
My hope is we can actually turn
what might be a high-risk moon shot

00:11:50.525 --> 00:11:52.294
into something that's more reliable.

00:11:52.318 --> 00:11:54.373
If you think about the original moon shot,

00:11:54.397 --> 00:11:56.295
where they actually landed on the moon,

00:11:56.319 --> 00:11:57.763
it was based on solid science.

00:11:57.787 --> 00:11:59.390
We understood gravity;

00:11:59.414 --> 00:12:00.755
we understood aerodynamics.

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:02.174
We knew how to build rockets.

00:12:02.198 --> 00:12:04.666
The science risk was under control.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.443
It was still a great, great
feat of engineering.

00:12:07.467 --> 00:12:10.112
But in medicine, we don't
necessarily have all the laws.

00:12:10.136 --> 00:12:13.245
Do we have all the laws
that are analogous to gravity,

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:15.613
that are analogous to aerodynamics?

00:12:15.637 --> 00:12:17.367
I would argue that with technologies

00:12:17.391 --> 00:12:19.263
like the kinds I'm talking about today,

00:12:19.287 --> 00:12:20.980
maybe we can actually derive those.

00:12:21.004 --> 00:12:23.861
We can map the patterns
that occur in living systems,

00:12:23.885 --> 00:12:28.443
and figure out how to overcome
the diseases that plague us.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.578
You know, my wife and I
have two young kids,

00:12:31.602 --> 00:12:34.836
and one of my hopes as a bioengineer
is to make life better for them

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.589
than it currently is for us.

00:12:36.613 --> 00:12:40.343
And my hope is, if we can
turn biology and medicine

00:12:40.367 --> 00:12:44.724
from these high-risk endeavors
that are governed by chance and luck,

00:12:44.748 --> 00:12:48.675
and make them things
that we win by skill and hard work,

00:12:48.699 --> 00:12:50.597
then that would be a great advance.

00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:51.827
Thank you very much.

00:12:51.851 --> 00:13:02.234
(Applause)
