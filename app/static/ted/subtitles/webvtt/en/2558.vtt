00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.200
Imagine you're walking through a forest.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.096
I'm guessing you're thinking
of a collection of trees,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.856
what we foresters call a stand,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.520
with their rugged stems
and their beautiful crowns.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.920
Yes, trees are the foundation of forests,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.960
but a forest is much more
than what you see,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.240
and today I want to change
the way you think about forests.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.256
You see, underground
there is this other world,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.336
a world of infinite biological pathways

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.776
that connect trees
and allow them to communicate

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.280
and allow the forest to behave
as though it's a single organism.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.760
It might remind you
of a sort of intelligence.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.256
How do I know this?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.520
Here's my story.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.720
I grew up in the forests
of British Columbia.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.256
I used to lay on the forest floor
and stare up at the tree crowns.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.520
They were giants.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.896
My grandfather was a giant, too.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.376
He was a horse logger,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.960
and he used to selectively cut
cedar poles from the inland rainforest.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.736
Grandpa taught me about the quiet
and cohesive ways of the woods,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.160
and how my family was knit into it.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.216
So I followed in grandpa's footsteps.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.800
He and I had this curiosity about forests,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.936
and my first big "aha" moment

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.840
was at the outhouse by our lake.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.760
Our poor dog Jigs
had slipped and fallen into the pit.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.216
So grandpa ran up with his shovel
to rescue the poor dog.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.480
He was down there, swimming in the muck.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.696
But as grandpa dug
through that forest floor,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.336
I became fascinated with the roots,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.456
and under that, what I learned later
was the white mycelium

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.560
and under that the red
and yellow mineral horizons.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.416
Eventually, grandpa and I
rescued the poor dog,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.776
but it was at that moment that I realized

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.376
that that palette of roots and soil

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.840
was really the foundation of the forest.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.040
And I wanted to know more.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.400
So I studied forestry.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.056
But soon I found myself working
alongside the powerful people

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.960
in charge of the commercial harvest.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.536
The extent of the clear-cutting

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.816
was alarming,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.000
and I soon found myself
conflicted by my part in it.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.696
Not only that, the spraying
and hacking of the aspens and birches

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.016
to make way for the more commercially
valuable planted pines and firs

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.240
was astounding.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.760
It seemed that nothing could stop
this relentless industrial machine.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.040
So I went back to school,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.320
and I studied my other world.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.736
You see, scientists had just discovered
in the laboratory in vitro

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.896
that one pine seedling root

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.320
could transmit carbon
to another pine seedling root.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.936
But this was in the laboratory,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.016
and I wondered,
could this happen in real forests?

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.240
I thought yes.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.080
Trees in real forests might also
share information below ground.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.896
But this was really controversial,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.536
and some people thought I was crazy,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.616
and I had a really hard time
getting research funding.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.080
But I persevered,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.056
and I eventually conducted
some experiments deep in the forest,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.480
25 years ago.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.016
I grew 80 replicates of three species:

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.216
paper birch, Douglas fir,
and western red cedar.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.296
I figured the birch and the fir
would be connected in a belowground web,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.576
but not the cedar.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.120
It was in its own other world.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.296
And I gathered my apparatus,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.496
and I had no money,
so I had to do it on the cheap.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.136
So I went to Canadian Tire --

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.576
(Laughter)

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.016
and I bought some plastic bags
and duct tape and shade cloth,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.280
a timer, a paper suit, a respirator.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.336
And then I borrowed some
high-tech stuff from my university:

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.976
a Geiger counter, a scintillation counter,
a mass spectrometer, microscopes.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.456
And then I got some
really dangerous stuff:

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.256
syringes full of radioactive
carbon-14 carbon dioxide gas

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.296
and some high pressure bottles

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.840
of the stable isotope
carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.136
But I was legally permitted.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.856
(Laughter)

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.480
Oh, and I forgot some stuff,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.800
important stuff: the bug spray,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.440
the bear spray,
the filters for my respirator.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.360
Oh well.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.336
The first day of the experiment,
we got out to our plot

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.160
and a grizzly bear and her cub
chased us off.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.440
And I had no bear spray.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.296
But you know, this is how
forest research in Canada goes.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.776
(Laughter)

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.336
So I came back the next day,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.616
and mama grizzly and her cub were gone.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.656
So this time, we really got started,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.456
and I pulled on my white paper suit,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.320
I put on my respirator,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.376
and then

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.680
I put the plastic bags over my trees.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.176
I got my giant syringes,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.856
and I injected the bags

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.296
with my tracer isotope
carbon dioxide gases,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.536
first the birch.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.536
I injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.136
into the bag of birch.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.416
And then for fir,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.256
I injected the stable isotope
carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.016
I used two isotopes,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.296
because I was wondering

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.160
whether there was two-way communication
going on between these species.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.216
I got to the final bag,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.736
the 80th replicate,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.176
and all of a sudden
mama grizzly showed up again.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.616
And she started to chase me,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.056
and I had my syringes above my head,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.016
and I was swatting the mosquitos,
and I jumped into the truck,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.256
and I thought,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.016
"This is why people do lab studies."

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.480
(Laughter)

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.616
I waited an hour.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.256
I figured it would take this long

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.056
for the trees to suck up
the CO2 through photosynthesis,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.216
turn it into sugars,
send it down into their roots,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.936
and maybe, I hypothesized,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.760
shuttle that carbon belowground
to their neighbors.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.776
After the hour was up,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.376
I rolled down my window,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.000
and I checked for mama grizzly.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.000
Oh good, she's over there
eating her huckleberries.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.336
So I got out of the truck
and I got to work.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.256
I went to my first bag with the birch.
I pulled the bag off.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.600
I ran my Geiger counter over its leaves.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.480
Kkhh!

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.616
Perfect.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.576
The birch had taken up
the radioactive gas.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.176
Then the moment of truth.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.720
I went over to the fir tree.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.096
I pulled off its bag.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.456
I ran the Geiger counter up its needles,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.680
and I heard the most beautiful sound.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.640
Kkhh!

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.496
It was the sound of birch talking to fir,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.976
and birch was saying,
"Hey, can I help you?"

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.616
And fir was saying, "Yeah,
can you send me some of your carbon?

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.040
Because somebody
threw a shade cloth over me."

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.056
I went up to cedar, and I ran
the Geiger counter over its leaves,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.600
and as I suspected,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.760
silence.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.776
Cedar was in its own world.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.760
It was not connected into the web
interlinking birch and fir.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.120
I was so excited,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.976
I ran from plot to plot
and I checked all 80 replicates.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.136
The evidence was clear.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.096
The C-13 and C-14 was showing me

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.240
that paper birch and Douglas fir
were in a lively two-way conversation.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.816
It turns out at that time of the year,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.056
in the summer,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.736
that birch was sending more carbon to fir
than fir was sending back to birch,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.056
especially when the fir was shaded.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.056
And then in later experiments,
we found the opposite,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.616
that fir was sending more carbon to birch
than birch was sending to fir,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.280
and this was because the fir was still
growing while the birch was leafless.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.536
So it turns out the two species
were interdependent,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.840
like yin and yang.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.936
And at that moment,
everything came into focus for me.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.216
I knew I had found something big,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.976
something that would change the way
we look at how trees interact in forests,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.016
from not just competitors

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.720
but to cooperators.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.256
And I had found solid evidence

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.656
of this massive belowground
communications network,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.920
the other world.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.856
Now, I truly hoped and believed

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.496
that my discovery would change
how we practice forestry,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.296
from clear-cutting and herbiciding

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.256
to more holistic and sustainable methods,

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.496
methods that were less expensive
and more practical.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.760
What was I thinking?

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.200
I'll come back to that.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.600
So how do we do science
in complex systems like forests?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.056
Well, as forest scientists,
we have to do our research in the forests,

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.096
and that's really tough,
as I've shown you.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.360
And we have to be really good
at running from bears.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.336
But mostly, we have to persevere

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.256
in spite of all the stuff
stacked against us.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.896
And we have to follow our intuition
and our experiences

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.056
and ask really good questions.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.256
And then we've got to gather our data
and then go verify.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.440
For me, I've conducted and published
hundreds of experiments in the forest.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.080
Some of my oldest experimental plantations
are now over 30 years old.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.456
You can check them out.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.280
That's how forest science works.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.536
So now I want to talk about the science.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.616
How were paper birch
and Douglas fir communicating?

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.136
Well, it turns out they were conversing
not only in the language of carbon

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.176
but also nitrogen and phosphorus

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.936
and water and defense signals
and allele chemicals and hormones --

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.160
information.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.336
And you know, I have to tell you,
before me, scientists had thought

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.936
that this belowground
mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.456
was involved.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.560
Mycorrhiza literally means "fungus root."

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.256
You see their reproductive organs
when you walk through the forest.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.096
They're the mushrooms.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.136
The mushrooms, though,
are just the tip of the iceberg,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.416
because coming out of those stems
are fungal threads that form a mycelium,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.136
and that mycelium
infects and colonizes the roots

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.296
of all the trees and plants.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.976
And where the fungal cells
interact with the root cells,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.776
there's a trade of carbon for nutrients,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.856
and that fungus gets those nutrients
by growing through the soil

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.880
and coating every soil particle.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.136
The web is so dense that there can be
hundreds of kilometers of mycelium

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.720
under a single footstep.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.520
And not only that, that mycelium connects
different individuals in the forest,

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.936
individuals not only of the same species
but between species, like birch and fir,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.280
and it works kind of like the Internet.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.656
You see, like all networks,

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.496
mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.576
We made this map by examining
the short sequences of DNA

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:44.096
of every tree and every fungal individual
in a patch of Douglas fir forest.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.936
In this picture, the circles represent
the Douglas fir, or the nodes,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.080
and the lines represent the interlinking
fungal highways, or the links.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.456
The biggest, darkest nodes
are the busiest nodes.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.416
We call those hub trees,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.856
or more fondly, mother trees,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.496
because it turns out
that those hub trees nurture their young,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.056
the ones growing in the understory.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.216
And if you can see those yellow dots,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.536
those are the young seedlings
that have established within the network

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.800
of the old mother trees.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.600
In a single forest, a mother tree can be
connected to hundreds of other trees.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.096
And using our isotope tracers,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.616
we have found that mother trees

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.576
will send their excess carbon
through the mycorrhizal network

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.536
to the understory seedlings,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.696
and we've associated this
with increased seedling survival

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.960
by four times.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.096
Now, we know we all
favor our own children,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.360
and I wondered, could Douglas fir
recognize its own kin,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.760
like mama grizzly and her cub?

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.376
So we set about an experiment,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.296
and we grew mother trees
with kin and stranger's seedlings.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.216
And it turns out
they do recognize their kin.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.216
Mother trees colonize their kin
with bigger mycorrhizal networks.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.656
They send them more carbon below ground.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.256
They even reduce
their own root competition

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.136
to make elbow room for their kids.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.816
When mother trees are injured or dying,

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.360
they also send messages of wisdom
on to the next generation of seedlings.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.656
So we've used isotope tracing

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.256
to trace carbon moving
from an injured mother tree

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.616
down her trunk
into the mycorrhizal network

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.640
and into her neighboring seedlings,

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.416
not only carbon but also defense signals.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.256
And these two compounds

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.376
have increased the resistance
of those seedlings to future stresses.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.680
So trees talk.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.576
(Applause)

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.800
Thank you.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.736
Through back and forth conversations,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.440
they increase the resilience
of the whole community.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.256
It probably reminds you
of our own social communities,

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.856
and our families,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.261
well, at least some families.

00:12:57.285 --> 00:12:59.496
(Laughter)

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.425
So let's come back to the initial point.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.936
Forests aren't simply
collections of trees,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.496
they're complex systems
with hubs and networks

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.016
that overlap and connect trees
and allow them to communicate,

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.816
and they provide avenues
for feedbacks and adaptation,

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.256
and this makes the forest resilient.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.656
That's because there are many hub trees
and many overlapping networks.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.656
But they're also vulnerable,

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.560
vulnerable not only
to natural disturbances

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.896
like bark beetles that preferentially
attack big old trees

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.360
but high-grade logging
and clear-cut logging.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.056
You see, you can take out
one or two hub trees,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.800
but there comes a tipping point,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.856
because hub trees are not
unlike rivets in an airplane.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.416
You can take out one or two
and the plane still flies,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.016
but you take out one too many,

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.656
or maybe that one holding on the wings,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.520
and the whole system collapses.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.896
So now how are you thinking
about forests? Differently?

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.136
(Audience) Yes.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.360
Cool.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.240
I'm glad.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.776
So, remember I said earlier
that I hoped that my research,

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.176
my discoveries would change
the way we practice forestry.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.320
Well, I want to take a check on that
30 years later here in western Canada.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.376
This is about 100 kilometers
to the west of us,

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.760
just on the border of Banff National Park.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.560
That's a lot of clear-cuts.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.460
It's not so pristine.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:39.036
In 2014, the World Resources Institute
reported that Canada in the past decade

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.660
has had the highest forest disturbance
rate of any country worldwide,

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.340
and I bet you thought it was Brazil.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.676
In Canada, it's 3.6 percent per year.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.620
Now, by my estimation, that's about
four times the rate that is sustainable.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.436
Now, massive disturbance at this scale
is known to affect hydrological cycles,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.436
degrade wildlife habitat,

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.356
and emit greenhouse gases
back into the atmosphere,

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.300
which creates more disturbance
and more tree diebacks.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.276
Not only that, we're continuing
to plant one or two species

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.260
and weed out the aspens and birches.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.836
These simplified forests lack complexity,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.276
and they're really vulnerable
to infections and bugs.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.196
And as climate changes,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.500
this is creating a perfect storm

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.996
for extreme events, like the massive
mountain pine beetle outbreak

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.060
that just swept across North America,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.140
or that megafire in the last
couple months in Alberta.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.300
So I want to come back
to my final question:

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.756
instead of weakening our forests,

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.340
how can we reinforce them
and help them deal with climate change?

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.716
Well, you know, the great thing
about forests as complex systems

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.780
is they have enormous
capacity to self-heal.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.116
In our recent experiments,

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.596
we found with patch-cutting
and retention of hub trees

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.756
and regeneration to a diversity
of species and genes and genotypes

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.620
that these mycorrhizal networks,
they recover really rapidly.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.276
So with this in mind, I want to leave you
with four simple solutions.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.660
And we can't kid ourselves
that these are too complicated to act on.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.380
First, we all need
to get out in the forest.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.036
We need to reestablish
local involvement in our own forests.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.676
You see, most of our forests now

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.916
are managed using
a one-size-fits-all approach,

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:41.300
but good forest stewardship
requires knowledge of local conditions.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.100
Second, we need to save
our old-growth forests.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:52.740
These are the repositories of genes
and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.876
So this means less cutting.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.940
I don't mean no cutting, but less cutting.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.635
And third, when we do cut,

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.460
we need to save the legacies,

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.716
the mother trees and networks,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.875
and the wood, the genes,

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.796
so they can pass their wisdom
onto the next generation of trees

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.940
so they can withstand
the future stresses coming down the road.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.700
We need to be conservationists.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.539
And finally, fourthly and finally,

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.796
we need to regenerate our forests
with a diversity of species

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.036
and genotypes and structures

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.820
by planting and allowing
natural regeneration.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.516
We have to give Mother Nature
the tools she needs

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.260
to use her intelligence to self-heal.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.236
And we need to remember
that forests aren't just a bunch of trees

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.516
competing with each other,

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.460
they're supercooperators.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.356
So back to Jigs.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.836
Jigs's fall into the outhouse
showed me this other world,

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.556
and it changed my view of forests.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.916
I hope today to have changed
how you think about forests.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.196
Thank you.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:05.997
(Applause)
