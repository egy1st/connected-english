00:00:00.691 --> 00:00:02.770
Whenever I get to travel for work,

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:05.302
I try to find out where my
drinking water comes from,

00:00:05.326 --> 00:00:06.993
and where my poop and pee go.

00:00:07.017 --> 00:00:08.861
(Laughter)

00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:11.912
This has earned me the nickname
"The Poo Princess" in my family,

00:00:11.936 --> 00:00:15.913
and it's ruined many family vacations,
because this is not normal.

00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:21.873
But thinking about where it all goes
is the first step in activating

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:24.712
what are actually superpowers
in our poop and pee.

00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:25.812
(Laughter)

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:26.990
Yeah.

00:00:27.014 --> 00:00:28.172
And if we use them well,

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:30.347
we can live healthier
and more beautifully.

00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:33.992
Check out this landscape
in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:37.913
Just notice what kinds of words
and feelings come to mind.

00:00:39.588 --> 00:00:43.271
This landscape was watered
with treated sewage water.

00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:45.652
Does that change anything for you?

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:48.716
I imagine it might.

00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:51.482
And that's OK.

00:00:52.897 --> 00:00:55.094
How we feel about this

00:00:55.118 --> 00:00:58.565
is going to determine exactly
how innovative we can be.

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.169
And I want to explain how it works,

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:04.638
but what words do I use?

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:09.123
I mean, I can use profane words
like "shit" and "piss,"

00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:11.427
and then my grandma won't watch the video.

00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:14.831
Or I can use childish words
like "poo" and "pee." Eh.

00:01:15.252 --> 00:01:19.970
Or I can use scientific words
like "excrement" and "feces." Humph.

00:01:19.994 --> 00:01:21.261
I'll use a mix.

00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:22.625
(Laughter)

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.654
It's all I got. (Laughs)

00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:27.171
So, in this suburb,

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:31.120
the poo and the pee and the wash water
are going to this treatment plant

00:01:31.144 --> 00:01:33.261
right in the middle of the community.

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:35.946
It looks more like a park
than a treatment plant.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.356
The poo at the very bottom
of all those layers of gravel --

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.896
not touching anyone --

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.661
is providing solid food
for those marsh plants.

00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:47.519
And the clean, clear water
that comes out the other end

00:01:47.543 --> 00:01:51.304
is traveling underground
to water each person's yard.

00:01:51.328 --> 00:01:53.023
So even though they're in a desert,

00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:54.904
they get their own personal oasis.

00:01:55.963 --> 00:01:59.175
This approach is called
Integrated Water Management,

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:01.579
or holistic or closed-loop.

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:03.588
Whatever you want to call it,

00:02:03.612 --> 00:02:07.247
it's in conflict with the status quo
of how we think about sanitation,

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:10.599
which is contain, treat, push it away.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.585
But in this approach,
we're doing one step better.

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.971
We're designing for reuse
from the very beginning,

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:18.563
because everything does get reused,

00:02:18.587 --> 00:02:20.741
only now we're planning for it.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.397
And often, that makes for
really beautiful spaces.

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:29.107
But the most important thing
about this system

00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:31.130
isn't the technicals of how it works.

00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:33.440
It's how you feel about it.

00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:35.995
Do you want this in your yard?

00:02:36.507 --> 00:02:37.705
Why not?

00:02:38.368 --> 00:02:41.087
I got really curious about this question.

00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:44.451
Why don't we see more
innovation in sanitation?

00:02:44.475 --> 00:02:46.974
Why isn't that kind of thing
the new normal?

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.790
And I care so much about this question,

00:02:49.814 --> 00:02:51.973
that I work for a nonprofit called Recode.

00:02:51.997 --> 00:02:53.901
We want to accelerate adoption

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:56.697
of sustainable building
and development practices.

00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:58.465
We want more innovation.

00:03:00.274 --> 00:03:03.351
But a lot of times,
whole categories of innovation --

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:06.173
ones that can help us
live more beautifully --

00:03:06.197 --> 00:03:07.568
turn out to be illegal.

00:03:08.728 --> 00:03:12.180
Today's regulations and codes
were written under the assumption

00:03:12.204 --> 00:03:16.218
that best practices
would remain best practices,

00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:18.498
with incremental updates forever and ever.

00:03:19.387 --> 00:03:21.736
But innovation isn't always incremental.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:25.766
It turns out, how we feel
about any particular new technique

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.639
gets into everything we do:

00:03:27.663 --> 00:03:28.933
how we talk about it,

00:03:28.957 --> 00:03:30.783
how we encourage people to study,

00:03:30.807 --> 00:03:32.730
our jokes, our codes ...

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.701
And it ultimately determines
how innovative we can be.

00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:40.510
So, that's the first reason
we don't innovate in sanitation.

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.392
We're kind of uncomfortable
talking about sanitation,

00:03:44.416 --> 00:03:47.118
that's why I've gotten called
"The Poo Princess" so much.

00:03:47.142 --> 00:03:48.833
The second reason is:

00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:51.387
we think the problem is solved
here in the US.

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:53.063
But not so.

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:58.129
Here in the US we still get sick
from drinking shit in our sewage water.

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.844
Seven million people get sick every year,

00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:02.639
900 die annually.

00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:05.853
And we're not taking a holistic
approach to making it better.

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:08.782
So we're not solving it.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.424
Where I live in Portland, Oregon,

00:04:11.448 --> 00:04:14.251
I can't take Echo for a swim
during the rainy season,

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:17.383
because we dump raw sewage
sometimes into our river.

00:04:17.905 --> 00:04:21.130
Our rainwater and our sewage
go to the same treatment plant.

00:04:21.904 --> 00:04:24.896
Too much rain overflows into the river.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.545
And Portland is not alone here.

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.659
Forty percent of municipalities self-report

00:04:30.683 --> 00:04:34.512
dumping raw or partially treated
sewage into our waterways.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.600
The other bummer going on here
with our status quo

00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:43.181
is that half of all of your poop and pee
is going to fertilize farmland.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.185
The other half is being incinerated

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:47.423
or land-filled.

00:04:47.447 --> 00:04:48.955
And that's a bummer to me,

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.941
because there are amazing nutrients
in your daily doody.

00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:54.131
It is comparable to pig manure;

00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:56.432
we're omnivores, they're omnivores.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.623
Think of your poo and pee
as a health smoothie for a tree.

00:05:00.647 --> 00:05:04.470
(Laughter)

00:05:05.357 --> 00:05:07.166
The other bummer going on here

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.205
is that we're quickly moving
all the drugs we take into our waterways.

00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:16.202
The average wastewater treatment plant
can remove maybe half of the drugs

00:05:16.226 --> 00:05:17.439
that come in.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.540
The other half goes
right out the other side.

00:05:20.564 --> 00:05:24.020
Consider what a cocktail
of pharmaceuticals --

00:05:24.044 --> 00:05:26.065
hormones, steroids, Vicodin --

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:27.872
does to a fish,

00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:29.118
to a dog,

00:05:29.142 --> 00:05:30.342
to a child.

00:05:32.322 --> 00:05:35.802
But this isn't just some problem
that we need to contain.

00:05:36.215 --> 00:05:38.613
If we flip this around,
we can create a resource

00:05:38.637 --> 00:05:41.313
that can solve so many
of our other problems.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.138
And I want to get you
comfortable with this idea,

00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:48.311
so imagine the things I'm going
to show you, these technologies,

00:05:48.335 --> 00:05:50.324
and this attitude that says,

00:05:50.348 --> 00:05:51.696
"We're going to reuse this.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.934
Let's design to make it beautiful" --

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.491
as advanced potty training.

00:05:55.515 --> 00:05:56.538
(Laughter)

00:05:56.562 --> 00:05:58.288
I think you're ready for it.

00:05:58.312 --> 00:06:01.684
I think we as a culture are ready
for advanced potty training.

00:06:02.527 --> 00:06:05.006
And there are three great
reasons to enroll today.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.310
Number one:

00:06:07.094 --> 00:06:08.992
we can fertilize our food.

00:06:09.016 --> 00:06:11.528
Each one of us is pooping
and peeing something

00:06:11.552 --> 00:06:14.291
that could fertilize half
or maybe all of our food,

00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:15.758
depending on our diet.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.335
That dark brown poo in the toilet
is dark brown because of what?

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:21.747
Dead stuff, bacteria.

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:23.400
That's carbon.

00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:25.730
And carbon, if we're getting
that into the soil,

00:06:25.754 --> 00:06:28.785
is going to bind to the other minerals
and nutrients in there.

00:06:29.187 --> 00:06:31.112
Boom! Healthier food.

00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:33.323
Voilà! Healthier people.

00:06:34.325 --> 00:06:37.866
Chemical fertilizers by definition
don't have carbon in them.

00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:44.584
Imagine if we could move our animal manure
and our human manure to our soil,

00:06:44.608 --> 00:06:48.414
we might not need to rely
on fossil fuel-based fertilizers,

00:06:48.438 --> 00:06:50.409
mine minerals from far away.

00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:53.863
Imagine how much energy we could save.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.290
Now, some of us are concerned

00:06:58.314 --> 00:07:02.255
about industrial pollutants
contaminating this reuse cycle.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.975
That can be addressed.

00:07:05.445 --> 00:07:10.379
But we need to separate our discomfort
about talking about poo and pee

00:07:10.403 --> 00:07:14.767
so we can calmly talk
about how we want to reuse it

00:07:14.791 --> 00:07:17.432
and what things we don't want to reuse.

00:07:17.456 --> 00:07:18.612
And get this:

00:07:19.598 --> 00:07:22.393
if we change our approach to sanitation,

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:25.072
we can start to slow down climate change.

00:07:26.234 --> 00:07:28.136
Remember that carbon in the poop?

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.850
If we can get that into our soil bank,

00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:35.687
it's going to start to absorb
carbon dioxide that we put into the air.

00:07:36.154 --> 00:07:38.464
And that could help
slow down global warming.

00:07:39.397 --> 00:07:41.904
I want to show you some brave souls

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:46.234
who've had the courage to embrace
this advanced potty training approach.

00:07:47.028 --> 00:07:48.719
So those folks in New Mexico --

00:07:48.743 --> 00:07:50.123
why did they do it?

00:07:50.735 --> 00:07:53.414
'Cause they're in a desert?
'Cause they save money? Yeah.

00:07:53.842 --> 00:07:56.833
But more importantly,
they felt comfortable

00:07:58.217 --> 00:08:01.060
seeing what was going
down the toilet as a resource.

00:08:01.642 --> 00:08:03.738
Here's an average house
in Portland, Oregon.

00:08:03.762 --> 00:08:06.699
This house is special
because they have a composting toilet

00:08:06.723 --> 00:08:10.840
turning all their poo and pee,
over time, into a soil amendment.

00:08:11.547 --> 00:08:14.441
Their wash water, their shower water,
is going underground

00:08:14.465 --> 00:08:16.353
to a series of mulch basins,

00:08:17.127 --> 00:08:19.495
and then watering that orchard downhill.

00:08:20.392 --> 00:08:22.247
When they went to get this permitted,

00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:24.564
it wasn't allowed in Oregon.

00:08:25.222 --> 00:08:27.728
But it was allowed
in five other states nearby.

00:08:28.322 --> 00:08:32.394
That was Recode's -- my organization's --
first code-change campaign.

00:08:34.158 --> 00:08:38.620
Here's a great example where
the Integrated Water Management approach

00:08:38.644 --> 00:08:40.084
was the cheapest.

00:08:40.108 --> 00:08:44.704
This is three high-rise residential
buildings in downtown Portland,

00:08:44.728 --> 00:08:47.308
and they're not flushing
to the sewer system.

00:08:47.332 --> 00:08:48.491
How?

00:08:48.515 --> 00:08:52.437
Well, their wash water
is getting reused to flush toilets,

00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:54.128
cool mechanical systems,

00:08:54.152 --> 00:08:55.460
water the landscape.

00:08:56.028 --> 00:08:58.882
And then once the building
has thoroughly used everything --

00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:00.429
aka, shat in it --

00:09:00.453 --> 00:09:05.075
it's treated to highest standard
right on-site by plants and bacteria,

00:09:05.099 --> 00:09:08.544
and then infiltrated
into the groundwater right below.

00:09:09.371 --> 00:09:12.874
And all that was cheaper

00:09:12.898 --> 00:09:15.801
than updating the surrounding
sewer infrastructure.

00:09:16.553 --> 00:09:19.091
So that's the last reason
we should get really excited

00:09:19.115 --> 00:09:20.607
about doing things differently:

00:09:20.631 --> 00:09:22.826
we can save a lot of money.

00:09:24.085 --> 00:09:26.968
This was the first permit
of its kind in Oregon.

00:09:27.597 --> 00:09:31.758
Brave and open-minded people
sat down and felt comfortable saying,

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.910
"Yeah, that shit makes sense."

00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:36.402
(Laughter)

00:09:36.426 --> 00:09:37.667
"Let's do it."

00:09:37.691 --> 00:09:38.692
(Applause)

00:09:38.716 --> 00:09:39.867
You know?

00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:42.040
I keep showing examples

00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:44.222
where everyone's reusing
everything on-site.

00:09:44.246 --> 00:09:45.397
Why?

00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:48.695
Well, when we look at our aging
infrastructure -- and it is old --

00:09:48.719 --> 00:09:50.622
and we look at the cost of updating it,

00:09:50.646 --> 00:09:55.253
three-quarters of that cost is just
the pipes snaking through our city.

00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:57.845
So as we build anew, as we renovate,

00:09:57.869 --> 00:10:02.741
it might make more sense
to treat and reuse everything on-site.

00:10:03.499 --> 00:10:06.070
San Francisco realized that it made sense

00:10:06.094 --> 00:10:08.768
to invest in rebates for every household

00:10:08.792 --> 00:10:11.325
to reuse their wash water
and their rainwater

00:10:11.349 --> 00:10:12.982
to water the backyard,

00:10:13.006 --> 00:10:17.073
because the amount of water they would
save as a community would be so big.

00:10:18.261 --> 00:10:20.748
But why were all
these projects so innovative?

00:10:21.434 --> 00:10:23.026
The money piece, yeah.

00:10:23.963 --> 00:10:25.614
But more importantly,

00:10:25.638 --> 00:10:28.970
they felt comfortable with this idea
of advanced potty training.

00:10:29.572 --> 00:10:34.600
Imagine if we embraced
innovation for sanitation

00:10:34.624 --> 00:10:37.922
the way we have for, say, solar power.

00:10:38.565 --> 00:10:42.120
Think about it -- solar power used
to be uncommon and unaffordable.

00:10:42.144 --> 00:10:45.697
Now it's more a part
of our web of power than ever before.

00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:47.704
And it's creating resiliency.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.964
We now have sources of power like the sun

00:10:50.988 --> 00:10:53.444
that don't vary with our earthly dramas.

00:10:54.282 --> 00:10:56.443
What's driving all that innovation?

00:10:57.002 --> 00:10:58.376
It's us.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.423
We're talking about energy.

00:11:00.447 --> 00:11:02.818
It's cool to talk about energy.

00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:06.183
Some folks are even talking
about the problems

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:09.373
with the limited resources
where our current energy is coming from.

00:11:09.397 --> 00:11:13.461
We encourage our best and brightest
to work on this issue --

00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:16.677
better solar panels,
better batteries, everything.

00:11:18.099 --> 00:11:21.209
So let's talk about where
our drinking water is coming from,

00:11:21.233 --> 00:11:23.824
where our poo and pee are actually going.

00:11:24.344 --> 00:11:29.284
If we can get over this discomfort
with this entire topic,

00:11:29.308 --> 00:11:32.364
we could create something
that creates our future goldmine.

00:11:33.158 --> 00:11:34.779
Every time you flush the toilet,

00:11:34.803 --> 00:11:36.422
I want you to think,

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.470
"Where is my poop and pee going?

00:11:38.494 --> 00:11:40.397
Will they be gainfully employed?"

00:11:40.421 --> 00:11:41.673
(Laughter)

00:11:41.697 --> 00:11:44.875
"Or are they going to be wreaking
havoc in some waterway?"

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:46.802
If you don't know, find out.

00:11:46.826 --> 00:11:48.604
And if you don't like the answer,

00:11:48.628 --> 00:11:52.355
figure out how you can communicate
to those who can drive this change

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:56.391
that you have advanced potty training,
that you are ready for reuse.

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:58.842
How all of you feel

00:11:58.866 --> 00:12:02.167
is going to determine exactly
how innovative we can be.

00:12:02.191 --> 00:12:03.350
Thank you so much.

00:12:03.374 --> 00:12:08.851
(Applause)
