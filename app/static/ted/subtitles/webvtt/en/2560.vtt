00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.336
The narrative of a rising Africa
is being challenged.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.816
About 10 years ago,
I spoke about an Africa,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.536
an Africa of hope and opportunity,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.496
an Africa of entrepreneurs,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.976
an Africa very different from the Africa
that you normally hear about

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.776
of death, poverty and disease.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.856
And that what I spoke about,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.336
became part of what is known now
as the narrative of the rising Africa.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.696
I want to tell you two stories
about this rising Africa.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.496
The first has to do with Rwanda,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.936
a country that has gone
through many trials and tribulations.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.456
And Rwanda has decided to become
the technology hub, or a technology hub

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.816
on the continent.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.856
It's a country with mountainous
and hilly terrain,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.096
a little bit like here,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.296
so it's very difficult
to deliver services to people.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.016
So what has Rwanda said?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.696
In order to save lives,
it's going to try using drones

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.936
to deliver lifesaving drugs,
vaccines and blood

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.976
to people in hard-to-reach places

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.496
in partnership with
a company called Zipline,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.056
with UPS, and also with the Gavi,
a global vaccine alliance.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.456
In doing this, it will save lives.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.776
This is part of the type of innovation
we want to see in the rising Africa.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.336
The second story has to do with something

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.376
that I'm sure most of you
have seen or will remember.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.296
Very often, countries in Africa
suffer drought and floods,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.016
and it's getting more frequent
because of climate change effects.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.736
When this happens, they normally wait
for international appeals to raise money.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.136
You see pictures of children
with flies on their faces,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.656
carcasses of dead animals and so on.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.696
Now these countries,
32 countries, came together

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.176
under the auspices of the African Union

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.216
and decided to form an organization
called the African Risk Capacity.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.456
What does it do?

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.576
It's a weather-based insurance agency,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.976
and what these countries do
is to pay insurance each year,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.936
about 3 million dollars a year
of their own resources,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.776
so that in the event they have
a difficult drought situation or flood,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.416
this money will be paid out to them,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.176
which they can then use
to take care of their populations,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.976
instead of waiting for aid to come.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.216
The African Risk Capacity
last year paid 26 million dollars

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.736
to Mauritania, Senegal and Niger.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.216
This enabled them to take care
of 1.3 million people affected by drought.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.576
They were able to restore livelihoods,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.296
buy fodder for cattle,
feed children in school

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.096
and in short keep the populations home
instead of migrating out of the area.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.976
So these are the kinds of stories

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.616
of an Africa ready
to take responsibility for itself,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.816
and to look for solutions
for its own problems.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.336
But that narrative is being challenged now

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.176
because the continent has not
been doing well in the last two years.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.136
It had been growing
at five percent per annum

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.096
for the last one and a half decades,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.896
but this year's forecast
was three percent. Why?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.096
In an uncertain global environment,
commodity prices have fallen.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.296
Many of the economies
are still commodity driven,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.880
and therefore their
performance has slipped.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.456
And now the issue of Brexit
doesn't make it any easier.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.096
I never knew that the Brexit could happen

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.256
and that it could be one of the things
that would cause global uncertainty

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.576
such as we have.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.776
So now we've got this situation,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.656
and I think it's time to take stock

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.536
and to say what were the things
that the African countries did right?

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.200
What did they do wrong?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.296
How do we build on all of this
and learn lessons

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.120
so that we can keep Africa rising?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.080
So let me talk about six things
that I think we did right.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.016
The first is managing
our economies better.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.296
The '80s and '90s were the lost decades,
when Africa was not doing well,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.936
and some of you will remember
an "Economist" cover

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.976
that said, "The Lost Continent."

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.096
But in the 2000s, policymakers learned

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.376
that they needed to manage
the macroeconomic environment better,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.936
to ensure stability,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.576
keep inflation low in single digits,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.176
keep their fiscal deficits low,
below three percent of GDP,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.096
give investors, both domestic and foreign,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.936
some stability so they'll have confidence
to invest in these economies.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.456
So that was number one.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.816
Two, debt.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.536
In 1994, the debt-to-GDP ratio
of African countries was 130 percent,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.816
and they didn't have fiscal space.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.856
They couldn't use their resources
to invest in their development

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.336
because they were paying debt.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.096
There may be some of you in this room
who worked to support African countries

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.416
to get debt relief.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.896
So private creditors, multilaterals
and bilaterals came together

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.536
and decided to do the Highly Indebted
Poor Countries Initiative

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.816
and give debt relief.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.936
So this debt relief in 2005

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.896
made the debt-to-GDP ratio
fall down to about 30 percent,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.816
and there was enough resources
to try and reinvest.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.296
The third thing was
loss-making enterprises.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.376
Governments were involved in business

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.656
which they had no business being in.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.776
And they were running businesses,
they were making losses.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.536
So some of these enterprises
were restructured,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.976
commercialized, privatized or closed,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.200
and they became
less of a burden on government.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.480
The fourth thing
was a very interesting thing.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.496
The telecoms revolution came,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.096
and African countries jumped on it.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.736
In 2000, we had 11 million phone lines.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.096
Today, we have about 687 million
mobile lines on the continent.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.936
And this has enabled us

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.616
to go, move forward
with some mobile technology

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.256
where Africa is actually leading.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.816
In Kenya, the development
of mobile money --

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.616
M-Pesa, which all of you
have heard about --

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.096
it took some time for the world
to notice that Africa was ahead

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.656
in this particular technology.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.896
And this mobile money
is also providing a platform

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.376
for access to alternative energy.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.896
You know, people who can now pay for solar

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.136
the same way they pay
for cards for their telephone.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.680
So this was a very good development,
something that went right.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.736
We also invested more
in education and health, not enough,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.416
but there were some improvements.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.960
250 million children were immunized
in the last one and a half decades.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.896
The other thing was
that conflicts decreased.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.976
There were many conflicts
on the continent.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.456
Many of you are aware of that.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.296
But they came down, and our leaders
even managed to dampen some coups.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.376
New types of conflicts have emerged,
and I'll refer to those later.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.016
So based on all this, there's also
some differentiation on the continent

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.496
that I want you to know about,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.016
because even as
the doom and gloom is here,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.016
there are some countries --
Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Ethiopia,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.320
Tanzania and Senegal are performing
relatively well at the moment.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.256
But what did we do wrong?

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.656
Let me mention eight things.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.856
You have to have
more things wrong than right.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.336
(Laughter)

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.736
So there are eight things we did wrong.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.280
The first was that even though we grew,
we didn't create enough jobs.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.696
We didn't create jobs for our youth.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.656
Youth unemployment on the continent
is about 15 percent,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.720
and underemployment is a serious problem.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.936
The second thing that we did is that
the quality of growth was not good enough.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.496
Even those jobs we created
were low-productivity jobs,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.016
so we moved people
from low-productivity agriculture

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.976
to low-productivity commerce
and working in the informal sector

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.720
in the urban areas.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.040
The third thing
is that inequality increased.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.576
So we created more billionaires.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.296
50 billionaires worth 96 billion dollars

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.160
own more wealth than the bottom
75 million people on the continent.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.496
Poverty,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.896
the proportion of people in poverty --
that's the fourth thing -- did decrease,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.016
but the absolute numbers did not
because of population growth.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.616
And population growth is something

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.056
that we don't have enough
of a dialogue about on the continent.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.216
And I think we will need
to get a handle on it,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.496
particularly how we educate girls.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.160
That is the road to really working
on this particular issue.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:36.696
The fifth thing is that we didn't invest
enough in infrastructure.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.816
We had investment from the Chinese.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.056
That helped some countries,
but it's not enough.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.416
The consumption of electricity
in Africa on the continent

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.016
in Sub-Saharan Africa
is equivalent to Spain.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.496
The total consumption
is equivalent to that of Spain.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.176
So many people are living in the dark,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.776
and as the President of the African
Development Bank said recently,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.080
Africa cannot develop in the dark.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.256
The other thing we have not done

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.696
is that our economies
retain the same structure

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.336
that we've had for decades.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.016
So even though we've been growing,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.736
the structure of the economies
has not changed very much.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.336
We are still exporting commodities,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.216
and exporting commodities is what?
It's exporting jobs.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.536
Our manufacturing value-added
is only 11 percent.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.096
We are not creating enough
decent manufacturing jobs for our youth,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.736
and trade among ourselves is low.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.256
Only about 12 percent of our trade
is among ourselves.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.976
So that's another serious problem.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.096
Then governance.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.536
Governance is a serious issue.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.776
We have weak institutions,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.816
and sometimes nonexistent institutions,
and I think this gives way for corruption.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.056
Corruption is an issue that we have not
yet gotten a good enough handle on,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.696
and we have to fight tooth and nail,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.296
that and increased transparency
in the way we manage our economies

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.776
and the way we manage our finances.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.536
We also need to be wary of new conflicts,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.496
new types of conflicts,

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.736
such as we have with Boko Haram
in my country, Nigeria,

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.816
and with Al-Shabaab in Kenya.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.176
We need to partner
with international partners,

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.056
developed countries,
to fight this together.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.976
Otherwise, we create a new reality

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.256
which is not the type
we want for a rising Africa.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.816
And finally, the issue of education.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.136
Our education systems
in many countries are broken.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.696
We are not creating the types of skills
needed for the future.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.360
So we have to find a way
to educate better.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.640
So those are the things
that we are not doing right.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.640
Now, where do we go from there?

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.936
I believe that the way forward
is to learn to manage success.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.696
Very often, when people succeed
or countries succeed,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.920
they forget what made them succeed.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.216
Learning what you're successful at,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.656
managing it and keeping it
is vital for us.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.896
So all those things I said we did right,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.816
we have to learn to do it right again,
keep doing it right.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.416
Managing the economy while
creating stability is vital,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.936
getting prices right,
and policy consistency.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.336
Very often, we are not consistent.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.616
One regime goes out, another comes in

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.096
and they throw away even the functioning
policies that were there before.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.376
What does this do?

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.776
It creates uncertainty
for people, for households,

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.176
uncertainties for business.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.896
They don't know whether and how to invest.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.256
Debt: we must manage
the success we had in reducing our debt,

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.816
but now countries
are back to borrowing again,

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.256
and we see our debt-to-GDP ratio
beginning to creep up,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.736
and in certain countries,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.256
debt is becoming a problem,
so we have to avoid that.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.736
So managing success.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.416
The next thing
is focusing with a laser beam

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.296
on those things we did not do well.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.176
First and foremost is infrastructure.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.776
Yes, most countries now recognize
they have to invest in this,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.416
and they are trying to do
the best they can to do that.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.656
We must.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.336
The most important thing is power.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.616
You cannot develop in the dark.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.896
And then governance and corruption:

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.136
we have to fight.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.936
We have to make our countries transparent.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.536
And above all, we have to
engage our young people.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.776
We have genius in our young people.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.056
I see it every day.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.616
It's what makes me wake up
in the morning and feel ready to go.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.016
We have to unleash
the genius of our young people,

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.296
get out of their way,
support them to create and innovate

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.536
and lead the way.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.256
And I know that they will lead us
in the right direction.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.456
And our women, and our girls:

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.536
we have to recognize
that girls and women are a gift.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.056
They have strength,

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.216
and we have to unleash that strength

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.176
so that they can
contribute to the continent.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.016
I strongly believe
that when we do all of these things,

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.256
we find that the rising Africa narrative

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.856
is not a fluke.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.120
It's a trend.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.536
It's a trend, and if we continue,
if we unleash our youth,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.896
if we unleash our women,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.936
we may step backwards sometimes,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.856
we may even step sideways,

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.496
but the trend is clear.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.536
Africa will continue to rise.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.296
And I tell you businesspeople
in the audience,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.776
investment in Africa is not for today,
is not for tomorrow,

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.056
it's not a short-term thing,
it's a longer term thing.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.496
But if you are not invested in Africa,

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.936
then you will be missing

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.216
one of the most important
emerging opportunities in the world.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.456
Thank you.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.000
(Applause)

00:13:39.227 --> 00:13:41.896
Kelly Stoetzel: So you mentioned
corruption in your talk,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.416
and you're known, well-known
as a strong anticorruption fighter.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.976
But that's had consequences.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.936
People have fought back,
and your mother was kidnapped.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.520
How have you been handling this?

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.456
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala:
It's been very difficult.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.816
Thank you for mentioning
the issue of the kidnap of my mother.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.416
It's a very difficult subject.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.296
But what it means
is that when you fight corruption,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.736
when you touch the pockets
of people who are stealing money,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.616
they don't just keep quiet.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.296
They fight back, and the issue for you
is when they try to intimidate you,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.776
do you give up, or do you fight on?

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.936
Do you find a way
to stay on and fight back?

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.216
And the answer that I had
with the teams I worked with

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.016
is we have to fight on.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.856
We have to create those institutions.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.096
We have to find ways to stop these people

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.296
from taking away
the heritage of the future.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.216
And so that's what we did.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.856
And even out of government,
we continued to make that point.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.856
In our countries, nobody,
nobody is going to fight corruption

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.416
for us but us.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.656
And therefore,
that comes with consequences,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.576
and we just have to do the best we can.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.016
But I thank you and thank TED
for giving us a voice

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.336
to say to those people, you will not win,

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.696
and we will not be intimidated.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.936
Thank you.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.176
(Applause)

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.666
Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you so much
for your great talk and important work.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.060
(Applause)
