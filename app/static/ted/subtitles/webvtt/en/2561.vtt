00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.190
June 29, 2016.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.002
My dear fellow citizen:

00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:13.076
I write to you today,

00:00:14.393 --> 00:00:17.949
to you who have lost in this era.

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:23.551
At this moment in our common life,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.820
when the world is full of breaking

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:27.695
and spite

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:29.505
and fear,

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:33.129
I address this letter

00:00:33.863 --> 00:00:35.644
simply to you,

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:38.062
even though we both know

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:42.228
there are many of you behind this "you,"

00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:47.024
and many of me behind this "I."

00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:53.081
I write to you because at present,

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:58.799
this quaking world we share scares me.

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:02.810
I gather it scares you, too.

00:01:04.618 --> 00:01:07.647
Some of what we fear, I suspect,

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:09.026
we fear in common.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:14.534
But much of what we fear
seems to be each other.

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:19.656
You fear the world I want to live in,

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:24.417
and I fear your visions in turn.

00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:30.446
Do you know that feeling you get
when you know it's going to storm

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.017
before it storms?

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.469
Do you also feel that now,

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:38.516
fellow citizen?

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:43.157
That malaise and worry

00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:45.770
that some who know

00:01:47.517 --> 00:01:50.183
feel reminds them of the 1930s?

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:53.747
Perhaps you don't,

00:01:54.493 --> 00:01:56.400
because our fears of each other

00:01:56.424 --> 00:01:57.943
are not in sync.

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:02.801
In this round, I sense
that your fears of me,

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:07.007
of the world that I have insisted
is right for us both,

00:02:08.856 --> 00:02:10.686
has gathered over a generation.

00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:16.136
It took time for your fears
to trigger my fears,

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:19.626
not least because at first,

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:22.355
I never thought I needed to fear you.

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:26.219
I heard you

00:02:27.737 --> 00:02:29.070
but did not listen,

00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:34.728
all these years when you said
that this amazing new world

00:02:36.204 --> 00:02:37.754
wasn't amazing for you,

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.483
for many of you,

00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:43.030
across the industrialized world;

00:02:43.918 --> 00:02:46.739
that the open, liquid world I relished,

00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:51.066
of people and goods
and technologies flowing freely,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.530
going where they pleased, globally,

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.279
was not, for you, an emancipation.

00:03:01.453 --> 00:03:03.894
I have walked through your towns

00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:09.182
and, while looking, failed to see.

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.730
I did notice in Stephenville, Texas,

00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:18.098
that the town square was dominated

00:03:18.122 --> 00:03:21.365
by one lawyer's office after another,

00:03:22.394 --> 00:03:25.395
because of all the people
rotating in and out of the prison.

00:03:26.224 --> 00:03:30.302
I did notice the barren shops
in Wagner, South Dakota,

00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:35.403
and the VFW gathering hall

00:03:36.314 --> 00:03:38.106
that stood in mockery

00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:41.725
of a community's dream to endure.

00:03:43.352 --> 00:03:44.566
I did notice

00:03:45.323 --> 00:03:48.748
at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania Wal-Mart,

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:53.804
that far too many people
in their 20s and 30s

00:03:53.828 --> 00:03:56.335
looked a decade or two from death,

00:03:57.295 --> 00:03:59.641
with patchy, flared-up skin

00:03:59.665 --> 00:04:02.141
and thinning, stringy hair

00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:03.817
and browning, ground-down teeth

00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:07.102
and a lostness in their eyes.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.770
I did notice that the young people
I encountered in Paris,

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.745
in Florence, in Barcelona,

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.279
had degrees but no place to take them,

00:04:19.712 --> 00:04:22.676
living on internships well into their 30s,

00:04:23.693 --> 00:04:26.589
their lives prevented from launching,

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.614
because of an economy
that creates wealth --

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:32.748
just not jobs.

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:40.138
I did notice the news about those parts
of London becoming ghost quarters,

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:46.693
where the global super-rich
turn fishy money into empty apartments

00:04:47.962 --> 00:04:52.064
and price lifelong residents of a city,
young couples starting out,

00:04:52.088 --> 00:04:53.803
out of their own home.

00:04:56.332 --> 00:04:59.253
And I heard that the fabric of your life

00:04:59.277 --> 00:05:00.522
was tearing.

00:05:01.574 --> 00:05:03.978
You used to be able to count on work,

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.169
and now you couldn't.

00:05:06.977 --> 00:05:09.817
You used to be able
to nourish your children,

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:13.420
and guarantee that they would climb

00:05:14.052 --> 00:05:17.978
a little bit further in life than you had,

00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:19.295
and now you couldn't.

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:25.959
You used to be made to feel dignity
in your work, and now you didn't.

00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:31.191
It used to be normal
for people like you to own a home,

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.849
and now it wasn't.

00:05:35.286 --> 00:05:37.466
I cannot say

00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:40.217
I didn't know these things,

00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:43.918
but I was distracted

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.987
creating a future in which
we could live on Mars,

00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:54.451
even as you struggled down here on Earth.

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:57.615
I was distracted

00:05:58.455 --> 00:06:00.289
innovating immortality,

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:07.312
even as many of you began to live
shorter lives than your parents had.

00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:12.360
I heard all of these things,
but I didn't listen.

00:06:13.528 --> 00:06:14.727
I looked

00:06:15.566 --> 00:06:17.137
but didn't see.

00:06:17.161 --> 00:06:20.286
I read, didn't understand.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.576
I paid attention

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.261
only when you began to vote and shout,

00:06:28.428 --> 00:06:31.492
and when your voting and shouting,
when the substance of it,

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.999
began to threaten me.

00:06:36.235 --> 00:06:41.228
I listened only when you moved
toward shattering continental unions

00:06:41.252 --> 00:06:43.513
and electing vulgar demagogues.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:48.608
Only then did your pain become of interest

00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:50.508
to me.

00:06:52.317 --> 00:06:54.271
I know that feeling hurt

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:57.588
is often prologue to dealing hurt.

00:06:59.664 --> 00:07:01.044
I wonder now

00:07:02.408 --> 00:07:04.686
if you would be less eager to deal it

00:07:05.438 --> 00:07:07.378
if I had stood with you

00:07:07.402 --> 00:07:09.686
when you merely felt it.

00:07:11.313 --> 00:07:12.590
I ask myself

00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:15.448
why I didn't stand with you then.

00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:20.251
One reason is that I became entranced

00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:22.364
by the gurus of change,

00:07:23.187 --> 00:07:27.522
became a worshiper of the religion
of the new for novelty's sake,

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:29.699
and of globalization and open borders

00:07:29.723 --> 00:07:32.660
and kaleidoscopic diversity.

00:07:34.928 --> 00:07:38.836
Once change became my totalizing faith,

00:07:40.415 --> 00:07:41.817
I could be blind.

00:07:43.143 --> 00:07:46.677
I could fail to see change's consequences.

00:07:47.866 --> 00:07:49.803
I could overlook the importance

00:07:49.827 --> 00:07:52.929
of roots, traditions,
rituals, stability --

00:07:52.953 --> 00:07:54.296
and belonging.

00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:58.816
And the more fundamentalist I became

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.582
in my worship of change and openness,

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.320
the more I drove you
towards the other polarity,

00:08:08.074 --> 00:08:09.234
to cling,

00:08:09.632 --> 00:08:10.789
to freeze,

00:08:11.277 --> 00:08:12.448
to close,

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.259
to belong.

00:08:16.138 --> 00:08:18.854
I now see as I didn't before

00:08:18.878 --> 00:08:22.819
that not having
the right skin or right organ

00:08:22.843 --> 00:08:26.766
is not the only varietal of disadvantage.

00:08:27.722 --> 00:08:31.312
There is a subtler, quieter disadvantage

00:08:31.336 --> 00:08:34.651
in having those privileged traits

00:08:34.675 --> 00:08:39.058
and yet feeling history to be
moving away from you;

00:08:39.082 --> 00:08:42.475
that while the past was hospitable
to people like you,

00:08:42.499 --> 00:08:44.897
the future will be more hospitable

00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:46.314
to others;

00:08:46.338 --> 00:08:48.791
that the world is growing less familiar,

00:08:48.815 --> 00:08:51.681
less yours day by day.

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:59.547
I will not concede for a moment
that old privileges should not dwindle.

00:09:00.055 --> 00:09:02.801
They cannot dwindle fast enough.

00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:07.285
It is for you to learn to live
in a new century in which

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:12.134
there are no bonuses for showing up
with the right skin and right organs.

00:09:13.277 --> 00:09:15.704
If and when your anger turns to hate,

00:09:15.729 --> 00:09:19.959
please know that there is no space
for that in our shared home.

00:09:21.642 --> 00:09:24.990
But I will admit, fellow citizen,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:31.679
that I have discounted the burden
of coping with the loss of status.

00:09:32.163 --> 00:09:33.932
I have forgotten

00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:38.702
that what is socially necessary
can also be personally gruelling.

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:42.424
A similar thing happened

00:09:43.217 --> 00:09:46.841
with the economy that you and I share.

00:09:48.191 --> 00:09:50.623
Just as I cannot and don't wish

00:09:50.647 --> 00:09:54.274
to turn back to the clock
on equality and diversity,

00:09:54.298 --> 00:09:56.627
and yet must understand

00:09:56.651 --> 00:09:59.417
the sense of loss they can inspire,

00:10:01.027 --> 00:10:05.185
so, too, I refuse
and could not if I wished

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.111
turn back the clock on an ever more
closely knit, interdependent world,

00:10:10.135 --> 00:10:13.525
and on inventions
that won't stop being invented.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.754
And yet I must understand
your experience of these things.

00:10:21.032 --> 00:10:24.451
You have for years been telling me
that your experience of these things

00:10:24.475 --> 00:10:27.617
is not as good as my theories forecast.

00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:32.386
Yet before you could finish
a complaining sentence

00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:39.604
about the difficulty of living
with erratic hours, volatile pay,

00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:41.254
vanishing opportunities,

00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:45.536
about the pain of dropping
your children off at 24-hour day care

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.323
to make your 3am shift,

00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:52.232
I shot back at you -- before you
could finish your sentence --

00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:53.598
my dogma,

00:10:53.622 --> 00:10:58.052
about how what you are actually
experiencing was flexibility

00:10:58.794 --> 00:11:00.080
and freedom.

00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:07.162
Language is one of the only things
that we truly share,

00:11:08.549 --> 00:11:12.028
and I sometimes used
this joint inheritance

00:11:12.052 --> 00:11:13.263
to obfuscate

00:11:13.821 --> 00:11:15.025
and deflect

00:11:15.479 --> 00:11:16.995
and justify myself;

00:11:17.933 --> 00:11:19.813
to re-brand what was good for me

00:11:19.837 --> 00:11:22.629
as something appearing good for us both,

00:11:23.324 --> 00:11:27.310
when I threw around terms
like "the sharing economy,"

00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:29.310
and "disruption"

00:11:29.845 --> 00:11:31.690
and "global resourcing."

00:11:33.224 --> 00:11:35.595
I see now that what I was really doing,

00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:37.475
at times,

00:11:37.894 --> 00:11:40.998
was buying your pain on the cheap,

00:11:41.892 --> 00:11:43.104
sprucing it up

00:11:43.772 --> 00:11:45.744
and trying to sell it back to you

00:11:46.244 --> 00:11:47.450
as freedom.

00:11:49.712 --> 00:11:52.971
I have wanted to believe
and wanted you to believe

00:11:55.683 --> 00:11:57.792
that the system that has been good to me,

00:11:57.816 --> 00:12:00.489
that has made my life ever more seamless,

00:12:01.229 --> 00:12:04.124
is also the best system for you.

00:12:05.544 --> 00:12:07.805
I have condescended to you

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:11.725
with the idea that you are voting
against your economic interests --

00:12:12.207 --> 00:12:13.995
voting against your interests,

00:12:15.621 --> 00:12:18.844
as if I know your interests.

00:12:20.296 --> 00:12:24.613
That is just my dogmatic
economism talking.

00:12:25.723 --> 00:12:27.500
I have a weakness

00:12:27.524 --> 00:12:32.909
for treating people's economic interests
as their only interest,

00:12:32.933 --> 00:12:36.457
ignoring things like belonging and pride

00:12:36.481 --> 00:12:40.255
and the desire to send a message
to those who ignore you.

00:12:40.688 --> 00:12:43.419
So here we are,

00:12:44.243 --> 00:12:48.869
in a scary but not inexplicable moment

00:12:49.507 --> 00:12:51.830
of demagoguery, fracture,

00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:56.367
xenophobia, resentment and fear.

00:12:57.628 --> 00:13:01.658
And I worry for us both
if we continue down this road,

00:13:02.358 --> 00:13:03.754
me not listening,

00:13:04.305 --> 00:13:06.156
you feeling unheard,

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.729
you shouting to get me to listen.

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:14.230
I worry when each of us is seduced
by visions of the future

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:16.914
that have no place for the other.

00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:19.819
If this goes on,

00:13:21.655 --> 00:13:23.030
if this goes on,

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:25.532
there may be blood.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.975
There are already hints of this blood

00:13:30.915 --> 00:13:32.255
in newspapers every day.

00:13:32.967 --> 00:13:35.552
There may be roundups, raids,

00:13:35.586 --> 00:13:38.661
deportations, camps, secessions.

00:13:39.494 --> 00:13:42.415
And no, I do not think that I exaggerate.

00:13:44.236 --> 00:13:46.157
There may be even talk of war

00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:49.731
in places that were certain
they were done with it.

00:13:51.483 --> 00:13:55.229
There is always the hope of redemption.

00:13:55.764 --> 00:13:59.042
But it will not be a cheap,
shallow redemption

00:13:59.066 --> 00:14:02.737
that comes through blather
about us all being in it together.

00:14:03.312 --> 00:14:05.168
This will take more.

00:14:06.396 --> 00:14:11.588
It will take accepting that we both
made choices to be here.

00:14:13.863 --> 00:14:16.966
We create our "others."

00:14:17.975 --> 00:14:21.655
As parents, as neighbors, as citizens,

00:14:22.503 --> 00:14:26.834
we witness and sometimes ignore each other

00:14:26.858 --> 00:14:28.098
into being.

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:32.318
You were not born vengeful.

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:35.346
I have some role

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.871
in whatever thirst
you now feel for revenge,

00:14:39.685 --> 00:14:41.598
and that thirst now tempts me

00:14:41.622 --> 00:14:44.140
to plot ever more elaborate escapes

00:14:44.164 --> 00:14:46.083
from our common life,

00:14:46.107 --> 00:14:47.976
from the schools and neighborhoods

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.931
and airports and amusement parks

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:51.596
that we used to share.

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:56.647
We face, then,

00:14:56.671 --> 00:15:00.445
a problem not of these large,
impersonal forces.

00:15:02.366 --> 00:15:06.518
We face a problem
of your and my relations.

00:15:07.815 --> 00:15:10.953
We chose ways of relating to each other

00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:13.496
that got us here.

00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:16.645
We can choose ways of relating

00:15:16.669 --> 00:15:18.275
that get us out.

00:15:19.361 --> 00:15:22.630
But there are things
we might have to let go of,

00:15:23.418 --> 00:15:24.599
fellow citizen,

00:15:25.674 --> 00:15:31.280
starting with our own cherished
versions of reality.

00:15:33.035 --> 00:15:36.904
Imagine if you let go of fantasies

00:15:36.928 --> 00:15:40.786
of a society purged
of these or those people.

00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:45.214
Imagine if I let go of my habit

00:15:45.755 --> 00:15:48.825
of saving the world behind your back,

00:15:49.833 --> 00:15:51.230
of deliberating on the future

00:15:51.254 --> 00:15:52.729
of your work,

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.506
your food,

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.000
your schools,

00:15:56.024 --> 00:15:59.034
in places where you couldn't
get past security.

00:16:00.386 --> 00:16:04.732
We can do this only if we first accept

00:16:05.347 --> 00:16:07.990
that we have neglected each other.

00:16:09.971 --> 00:16:13.185
If there is hope to summon

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.280
in this ominous hour,

00:16:16.202 --> 00:16:17.393
it is this.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.572
We have, for too long,

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:24.916
chased various shimmering dreams

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:31.682
at the cost of attention
to the foundational dream of each other,

00:16:33.101 --> 00:16:35.669
the dream of tending to each other,

00:16:35.693 --> 00:16:38.556
of unleashing each other's wonders,

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.125
of moving through history together.

00:16:42.046 --> 00:16:46.315
We could dare to commit
to the dream of each other

00:16:47.009 --> 00:16:51.716
as the thing that matters
before every neon thing.

00:16:52.476 --> 00:16:53.958
Let us dare.

00:16:54.467 --> 00:16:55.627
Sincerely yours,

00:16:56.067 --> 00:16:57.243
a fellow citizen.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:03.308
(Applause)
