00:00:01.103 --> 00:00:04.228
How do we build a society

00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:05.760
without fossil fuels?

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:09.120
This is a very complex challenge,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.400
and I believe developing countries
could take the lead in this transition.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.680
And I'm aware that this
is a contentious statement,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.736
but the reality is that so much
is at stake in our countries

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.640
if we let fossil fuels stay
at the center of our development.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.080
We can do it differently.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.456
And it's time, it really is time,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.176
to debunk the myth

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.256
that a country has to choose
between development on the one hand

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.680
and environmental protection,
renewables, quality of life, on the other.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.080
I come from Costa Rica,
a developing country.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.880
We are nearly five million people,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.776
and we live right in the middle
of the Americas,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.120
so it's very easy
to remember where we live.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.360
Nearly 100 percent of our electricity

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.856
comes from renewable sources,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.096
five of them.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.240
(Applause)

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.656
Hydropower, geothermal,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.120
wind, solar, biomass.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.136
Did you know that last year,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.616
for 299 days,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.856
we did not use any fossil fuels

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.360
in order to generate all our electricity?

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.200
It's a fantastic achievement,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.440
and yet, it hides a paradox,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.136
which is that nearly 70 percent

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.760
of all our energy consumption is oil.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.080
Why?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.536
Because of our transportation system,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.816
which is totally dependent
on fossil fuels,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.479
like it is in most countries.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.016
So if we think of the energy
transition as a marathon,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.936
the question is, how do we get
to the finish line,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.080
how do we decarbonize
the rest of the economy?

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.776
And it's fair to say
that if we don't succeed,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.576
it's difficult to see who will.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.160
So that is why I want
to talk to you about Costa Rica,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.856
because I believe we are a great candidate

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.280
in pioneering a vision
for development without fossil fuels.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.456
If you know one thing about our country,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.400
it's that we don't have an army.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.360
So I'm going to take you back to 1948.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.120
That year, the country
was coming out of civil war.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.936
Thousands of Costa Ricans had died,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.240
and families were bitterly split.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.256
And yet, a surprising idea
won the hearts and minds:

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.176
we would reboot the country,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.256
and that Second Republic
would have no army.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.520
So we abolished it.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.016
And the president at the time,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.216
JosÃ© Figueres,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.560
found a powerful way
by smashing the walls of an army base.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.376
The following year, 1949,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.576
we made that decision permanent
in the new constitution,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.760
and that is why I can tell you that story
nearly 70 years later.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.536
And I'm grateful.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.520
I'm grateful they made that decision
before I was born,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.536
because it allowed me
and millions of others

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.720
to live in a very stable country.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.136
And you might be thinking
that it was good luck,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.656
but it wasn't.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.720
There was a pattern of deliberate choices.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.136
In the '40s, Costa Ricans were given
free education and free health care.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.120
We called that social guarantees.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.376
By abolishing the army,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.336
we were able to turn military spending
into social spending,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.280
and that was a driver of stability.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.375
In the '50s --

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.480
(Applause)

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.976
In the '50s, we started
investing in hydropower,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.656
and that kept us away from the trap

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.736
of using fossil fuels
for electricity generation,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.120
which is what the world
is struggling with today.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.696
In the '70s we invested in national parks,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.680
and that kept us away

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.296
from the deeply flawed logic
of growth, growth, growth at any cost

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.000
that you see others embracing,
especially in the developing world.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.896
In the '90s, we pioneered payments
for ecosystem services,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.856
and that helped us reverse deforestation

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.040
and boosted ecotourism,
which today is a key engine of growth.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.936
So investing in environmental protection

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.176
did not hurt our economy.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.456
Quite the opposite.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.496
And it doesn't mean we are perfect,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.856
and it doesn't mean
we don't have contradictions.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.120
That's not the point.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.216
The point is that,
by making our own choices,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.200
we were able to develop resilience
in dealing with development problems.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.656
Also, if you take a country like ours,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.576
the GDP per capita
is around 11,000 dollars,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.320
depending on how you measure it.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.136
But according to
the Social Progress Index,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.056
we are an absolute outlier

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.200
when it comes to turning GDP
into social progress.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.536
Abolishing the army,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.376
investing in nature and people,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.200
did something very powerful, too.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.680
It shaped the narrative,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.616
the narrative of a small country
with big ideas,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.000
and it was very empowering
to grow up with that narrative.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.696
So the question is,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.800
what is the next big idea
for this generation?

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.696
And I believe what comes next

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.880
is for this generation
to let go of fossil fuels for good,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.280
just as we did with the army.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.696
Fossil fuels create climate change.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.096
We know that,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.616
and we know how vulnerable we are
to the impacts of climate change.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.296
So as a developing country,
it is in our best interest

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.296
to build development without fossil fuels

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.960
that harm people in the first place.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.120
Because

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.840
why would we continue importing oil

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.536
for transportation

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.720
if we can use electricity instead?

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.536
Remember,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.456
this is the country

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.536
where electricity
comes from water in our rivers,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.056
heat from volcanoes,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.416
wind turbines, solar panels,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.640
biowaste.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.856
Abolishing fossil fuels means
disrupting our transportation system

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.216
so that we can power our cars,
buses and trains with electricity

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.720
instead of dirty energy.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.816
And transportation, let me tell you,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.896
has become an existential issue
for us Costa Ricans,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.336
because the model we have
is not working for us.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.600
It's hurting people,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.216
it's hurting companies,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.216
and it's hurting our health.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.976
Because when policies
and infrastructure fail,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.240
this is what happens on a daily basis.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.376
Two hours in the morning,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.216
two hours in the evening.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.920
I don't understand why
we have to accept this as normal.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.000
It's offensive

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.960
to have to waste our time like this
every single day.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.816
And this highway is actually quite good

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.896
compared to what you see
in other countries

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.360
where traffic is exploding.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.280
You know, Costa Ricans call this "presa."

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.200
Presa means "imprisoned."

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.336
And people are turning violent

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.560
in a country that is otherwise
happy in pura vida.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.280
It's happening.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.240
So a lot is at stake.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.416
The good news

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.456
is that when we talk
about clean transportation

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.736
and different mobility,

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.775
we're not talking about
some distant utopia out there.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:39.559
We're talking about electric mobility
that is happening today.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:46.496
By 2022, electric cars
and conventional cars

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.600
are expected to cost the same,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.880
and cities are already trying
electric buses.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.840
And these really cool creatures

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.960
are saving money,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.760
and they reduce pollution.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.456
So if we want to get rid
of oil-based transportation, we can,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.096
because we have options now
that we didn't have before.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.400
It's really exciting.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.960
But of course,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.960
some get very uncomfortable
with this idea,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.936
and they will come and they will tell you

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.776
that the world is stuck with oil,
and so is Costa Rica, so get real.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.056
That's what they tell you.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.416
And you know what the answer
to that argument is?

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.016
That in 1948, we didn't say
the world is stuck with armies,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.976
so let's keep our army, too.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.960
No, we made a very brave choice,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.840
and that choice made the whole difference.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.976
So it's time for this generation
to be brave again

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.776
and abolish fossil fuels for good.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.400
And I'll give you three reasons
why we have to do this.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.440
First,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.856
our model of transportation
and urbanization is broken,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.320
so this is the best moment
to redefine our urban and mobility future.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.336
We don't want cities
that are built for cars.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.696
We want cities for people

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.576
where we can walk and we can use bikes.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.736
And we want public transportation,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.256
lots of it,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.320
public transportation
that is clean and dignifying.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.120
Because if we continue
adding fleets of conventional cars,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.960
our cities will become unbearable.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.736
Second, we have to change,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.240
but incremental change
is not going to be sufficient.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.760
We need transformational change.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.456
And there are some
incremental projects in my country,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.680
and I am the first one to celebrate them.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.176
But let's not kid ourselves.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.096
We're not talking about ending up
with really beautiful electric cars here

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.736
and a few electric buses there

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.136
while we keep investing
in the same kind of infrastructure,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.656
more cars, more roads, more oil.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.976
We're talking about
breaking free from oil,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.320
and you cannot get there
through incrementalism.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.520
Third, and you know this one,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.680
the world is hungry for inspiration.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.216
It craves stories of success

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.016
in dealing with complex issues,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.160
especially in developing countries.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.680
So I believe Costa Rica
can be an inspiration to others,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.456
as we did last year when we disclosed

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.456
that for so many days
we were not using any fossil fuels

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.336
in order to generate all our electricity.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.720
The news went viral around the world.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.736
Also, and this makes me extremely proud,

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.600
a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:01.280
played a decisive role in the negotiations
of the Paris climate agreement.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.320
So we have to protect that legacy
and be an example.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.200
So what comes next?

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.520
The people.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.840
How do we get people to own this?

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.856
How do we get people

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.296
to believe that it's possible

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.960
to build a society without fossil fuels?

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.360
A lot of work from
the ground up is needed.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.640
That is why, in 2014,
we created Costa Rica Limpia.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.416
"Limpia" means "clean,"

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.080
because we want to empower
and we want to inspire citizens.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.680
If citizens don't get engaged,

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.736
clean transportation decisions
will be bogged down by endless,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.736
and I mean endless, technical discussions,

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.040
and by avalanches of lobbying
by various established interests.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.576
Wanting to be a green country
powered by renewables

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.176
is already part of our story.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.880
We should not let anybody
take that away from us.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.536
Last year, we brought people
from our seven provinces

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.800
to talk about climate change
in terms that matter to them,

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.616
and we also brought this year

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.696
another group of Costa Ricans

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.816
to talk about renewable energy.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.096
And you know what?

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.376
These people disagree on almost everything

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.056
except on renewable energy

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.176
and clean transportation and clean air.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.176
It brings people together.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.056
And the key to real participation

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.296
is to help people not to feel small.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.616
People feel powerless,

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.960
and they are tired of not being heard.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.376
So what we do is concrete things,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.896
and we translate technical issues
into citizen language

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.640
to show that citizens have a role to play
and can play it together.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.696
For the first time, we're tracking
the promises that were made

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.216
on clean transportation,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.856
and politicos know
that they have to deliver it,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.880
but the tipping point will come
when we form coalitions --

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.816
citizens, companies,

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.016
champions of public transportation --

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.816
that will make electric mobility
the new normal,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.200
especially in a developing country.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.256
By the time the next election comes,

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.696
I believe every candidate
will have to disclose where they stand

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.616
on the abolition of fossil fuels.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.440
Because this question
has to enter our mainstream politics.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.976
And I'm telling you,
this is not a question of climate policy

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.760
or environmental agenda.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.360
It's about the country that we want

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.256
and the cities that we have

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.936
and the cities that we want

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.136
and who makes that choice.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.336
Because at the end of the day,
what we have to show

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.496
is that development with renewable energy

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.280
is good for the people,

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.856
for Costa Ricans that are alive today

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.480
and especially for those
who haven't been born.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.616
This is our National Museum today.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.336
It's bright and peaceful,

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.056
and when you stand up in front of it,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.376
it's really hard to believe
these were military barracks

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.576
at the end of the '40s.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.416
We started a new life
without an army in this place,

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.296
and here is where our abolition

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.216
of fossil fuels will be announced one day.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.536
And we will make history again.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.776
Thank you.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.922
(Applause)
