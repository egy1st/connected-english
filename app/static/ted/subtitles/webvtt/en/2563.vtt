WEBVTT

00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:04.270
Guys, we have an issue.

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:05.392
(Laughter)

00:00:05.416 --> 00:00:08.210
Growth is fading away,
and it's a big deal.

00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:11.292
Our global economy stops growing.

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:13.417
And it's not new.

00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:16.752
Growth has actually declined
for the last 50 years.

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:19.753
If we continue like this, we need to learn

00:00:19.777 --> 00:00:23.502
how to live in a world
with no growth in the next decade.

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.726
This is scary because
when the economy doesn't grow,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.710
our children don't get better lives.

00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:33.948
What's even scarier is that
when the pie does not grow,

00:00:33.972 --> 00:00:35.528
each of us get a smaller piece.

00:00:35.552 --> 00:00:37.667
We're then ready to fight
for a bigger one.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.210
This creates tensions
and serious conflicts.

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:43.523
Growth matters a lot.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.638
If we look at the history of growth,

00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:50.174
times of big growth
have always been fueled

00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:52.223
by big manufacturing revolutions.

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:55.724
It happened three times,
every 50-60 years.

00:00:56.419 --> 00:01:00.443
The steam engine
in the middle of the 19th century,

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:04.228
the mass-production model
in the beginning of the 20th century --

00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:05.571
thanks, Mr. Ford.

00:01:06.384 --> 00:01:09.368
And the first automation
wave in the 1970s.

00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:12.353
Why did these manufacturing revolutions

00:01:12.377 --> 00:01:14.602
create huge growth in our economies?

00:01:15.677 --> 00:01:18.791
Because they have injected
huge productivity improvement.

00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:20.741
It's rather simple:

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.315
in order to grow,
you need to be producing more,

00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:26.307
putting more into our economy.

00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:32.853
This means either more labor
or more capital or more productivity.

00:01:32.877 --> 00:01:35.892
Each time, productivity
has been the growth lever.

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:40.487
I'm here today to tell you

00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:44.221
that we are on the verge
of another huge change,

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:47.707
and that this change, surprisingly enough,

00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:50.401
is going to come
from manufacturing, again.

00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:54.502
It will get us out of our growth slump

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:58.370
and it will change radically
the way globalization has been shaped

00:01:58.394 --> 00:01:59.635
over the last decade.

00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:05.206
I'm here to tell you about the amazing
fourth manufacturing revolution

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.642
that is currently underway.

00:02:07.213 --> 00:02:09.674
It's not as if we've done nothing
with manufacturing

00:02:09.698 --> 00:02:10.987
since the last revolution.

00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:13.426
Actually, we've made
some pretty lame attempts

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.051
to try to revitalize it.

00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:18.052
But none of them
have been the big overhaul

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:19.965
we really need to get us growing again.

00:02:20.384 --> 00:02:24.978
For example, we've tried
to relocate our factories offshore

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:28.025
in order to reduce cost
and take advantage of cheap labor.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:32.631
Not only did this not
inspire productivity,

00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:35.127
but it only saved money
for a short period of time,

00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:37.690
because cheap labor
didn't stay cheap for long.

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:42.377
Then, we've tried to make
our factories larger

00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:44.290
and we specialized them by product.

00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:48.631
The idea was that we can
make a lot of one product

00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:51.037
and stockpile it to be sold with demand.

00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:54.601
This did help productivity for a while.

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:58.546
But it introduced a lot of rigidities
in our supply chain.

00:02:59.432 --> 00:03:00.828
Let's take fashion retail.

00:03:01.232 --> 00:03:03.350
Traditional clothing companies

00:03:03.374 --> 00:03:08.021
have built offshore,
global, rigid supply chains.

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:11.538
When fast-fashion competitors like Zara

00:03:11.562 --> 00:03:14.073
started replenishing their stocks faster

00:03:14.097 --> 00:03:17.776
from two collections a year
to one collection a month,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.344
none of them have been able
to keep up with the pace.

00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:23.078
Most of them are
in great difficulties today.

00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:27.212
Yet, with all of their shortcomings,

00:03:27.236 --> 00:03:29.181
those are the factories we know today.

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.157
When you open the doors,

00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.087
they look the same
as they did 50 years ago.

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:39.435
We've just changed the location,
the size, the way they operate.

00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:42.617
Can you name anything else
that looks the same

00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:44.196
as it did 50 years ago?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.375
It's crazy.

00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:48.868
We've made all the tweaks
to the model that we could,

00:03:48.892 --> 00:03:51.890
and now we hit its limits.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:57.869
After all of our attempts to fix
the manufacturing model failed,

00:03:57.893 --> 00:04:00.698
we thought growth could come
from elsewhere.

00:04:00.722 --> 00:04:02.762
We turned to the tech sector --

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:05.154
there's been quite a lot
of innovations there.

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:06.973
Just to name one: the Internet.

00:04:07.906 --> 00:04:09.711
We hoped it could produce growth.

00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:12.227
And indeed, it changed our lives.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:16.696
It made big waves in the media,
the service, the entertainment spaces.

00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:19.157
But it hasn't done much for productivity.

00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:24.307
Actually, what's surprising
is that productivity is on the decline

00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:26.860
despite all of those innovation efforts.

00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:31.281
Imagine that -- sitting at work,
scrolling through Facebook,

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:35.109
watching videos on YouTube
has made us less productive.

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:36.284
Weird.

00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:37.892
(Laughter)

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:39.697
This is why we are not growing.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.856
We failed at reinventing
the manufacturing space,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.830
and large technological innovations
have played away from it.

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:51.458
But what if we could combine those forces?

00:04:51.927 --> 00:04:56.795
What if the existing manufacturing
and large technological innovation

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.382
came together to create
the next big manufacturing reinvention.

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:02.664
Bingo!

00:05:02.688 --> 00:05:05.171
This is the fourth
manufacturing revolution,

00:05:05.195 --> 00:05:06.859
and it's happening right now.

00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:10.621
Major technologies are entering
the manufacturing space,

00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:11.795
big time.

00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:15.412
They will boost industrial productivity
by more than a third.

00:05:16.217 --> 00:05:19.943
This is massive, and it will do
a lot in creating growth.

00:05:21.286 --> 00:05:23.092
Let me tell you about some of them.

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:26.990
Have you already met advanced
manufacturing robots?

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:29.678
They are the size of humans,

00:05:29.702 --> 00:05:31.723
they actually collaborate with them,

00:05:31.747 --> 00:05:33.326
and they can be programmed

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.262
in order to perform
complex, non-repetitive tasks.

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:42.566
Today in our factories, only
8 percent of the tasks are automated.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.855
The less complex,
the more repetitive ones.

00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:49.428
It will be 25 percent in 10 years.

00:05:49.452 --> 00:05:52.265
It means that by 2025,

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.853
advanced robots will complement workers

00:05:54.877 --> 00:05:57.720
to be, together,
20 percent more productive,

00:05:57.744 --> 00:05:59.745
to manufacture 20 percent more outputs,

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:01.886
to achieve 20 percent additional growth.

00:06:03.118 --> 00:06:06.042
This isn't some fancy, futuristic idea.

00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:09.002
These robots are working for us right now.

00:06:09.993 --> 00:06:15.539
Last year in the US, they helped
Amazon prepare and ship all the products

00:06:15.563 --> 00:06:17.657
required for Cyber Monday,

00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:19.703
the annual peak of online retail.

00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:22.025
Last year in the US,

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:27.947
it was the biggest online shopping day
of the year and of history.

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:32.252
Consumers spent 3 billion dollars
on electronics that day.

00:06:32.276 --> 00:06:34.791
That's real economic growth.

00:06:35.502 --> 00:06:39.550
Then there's additive
manufacturing, 3D printing.

00:06:39.574 --> 00:06:43.582
3D printing has already improved
plastic manufacturing

00:06:43.606 --> 00:06:46.590
and it's now making its way through metal.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:48.199
Those are not small industries.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:51.891
Plastic and metals represent 25 percent

00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:53.915
of global manufacturing production.

00:06:54.717 --> 00:06:56.266
Let's take a real example.

00:06:57.005 --> 00:06:59.943
In the aerospace industry,

00:06:59.967 --> 00:07:04.460
fuel nozzles are some of the most
complex parts to manufacture,

00:07:04.484 --> 00:07:05.782
for one reason:

00:07:05.806 --> 00:07:08.995
they are made up of 20 different parts

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:11.830
that need to be separately produced

00:07:11.854 --> 00:07:14.479
and then painstakingly assembled.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:18.427
Aerospace companies
are now using 3D printing,

00:07:18.451 --> 00:07:21.515
which allows them to turn
those 20 different parts

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:22.849
into just one.

00:07:23.368 --> 00:07:24.518
The results?

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:27.245
40 percent more productivity,

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:30.536
40 percent more output produced,
40 percent more growth

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.105
for this specific industry.

00:07:33.283 --> 00:07:39.433
But actually, the most exciting part
of this new manufacturing revolution

00:07:39.457 --> 00:07:41.862
goes much beyond productivity.

00:07:42.692 --> 00:07:46.263
It's about producing better,
smarter products.

00:07:46.287 --> 00:07:48.701
It's about scale customization.

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:53.834
Imagine a world where you can buy
the exact products you want

00:07:53.858 --> 00:07:56.068
with the functionalities you need,

00:07:56.092 --> 00:07:58.040
with the design you want,

00:07:58.064 --> 00:07:59.650
with the same cost and lead time

00:07:59.674 --> 00:08:01.556
as a product that's been mass produced,

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.447
like your car, or your clothes
or your cell phone.

00:08:05.113 --> 00:08:07.790
The new manufacturing revolution
makes it possible.

00:08:08.577 --> 00:08:11.398
Advanced robots can be programmed

00:08:11.422 --> 00:08:14.541
in order to perform
any product configuration

00:08:14.565 --> 00:08:17.212
without any setup time or ramp up.

00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:23.651
3D printers instantaneously produce
any customized design.

00:08:23.675 --> 00:08:29.344
We are now able to produce
a batch of one product, your product,

00:08:29.368 --> 00:08:32.602
at the same cost and lead time
as a batch of many.

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:37.436
Those are only a few examples
of the manufacturing revolution at play.

00:08:38.468 --> 00:08:42.555
Not only will manufacturing
become more productive,

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:45.514
it will also become more flexible,

00:08:45.538 --> 00:08:50.069
and those were exactly the elements
of growth that we are missing.

00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:54.724
But actually, there are even
some bigger implications

00:08:54.748 --> 00:08:59.754
for all of us when manufacturing
will find its way back into the limelight.

00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:03.925
It will create a huge macroeconomic shift.

00:09:04.683 --> 00:09:09.120
First, our factories will be relocated
into our home markets.

00:09:09.877 --> 00:09:12.120
In the world of scale customization,

00:09:12.144 --> 00:09:14.745
consumer proximity is the new norm.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:19.894
Then, our factories
will be smaller, agile.

00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:23.027
Scale does not matter anymore,
flexibility does.

00:09:23.802 --> 00:09:27.395
They will be operating on a multi-product,
made-to-order basis.

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.067
The change will be drastic.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.105
Globalization will enter a new era.

00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:38.060
The East-to-West trade flows

00:09:38.084 --> 00:09:40.765
will be replaced by regional trade flows.

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:43.094
East for East, West for West.

00:09:43.687 --> 00:09:44.927
When you think about that,

00:09:45.884 --> 00:09:48.294
the old model was pretty much insane.

00:09:49.065 --> 00:09:52.816
Piling up stocks, making products
travel the whole world

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.719
before they reach their end consumers.

00:09:54.743 --> 00:09:58.983
The new model, producing
just next to the consumer market,

00:09:59.007 --> 00:10:03.452
will be much cleaner,
much better for our environment.

00:10:04.678 --> 00:10:08.463
In mature economies,
manufacturing will be back home,

00:10:08.487 --> 00:10:10.563
creating more employment,

00:10:10.587 --> 00:10:12.954
more productivity and more growth.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.422
Good news, isn't it?

00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:18.346
But here's the thing with growth --

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.025
it does not come automatically.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.455
Mature economies will have to seize it.

00:10:23.196 --> 00:10:26.102
We'll have to massively
re-train our workforce.

00:10:26.547 --> 00:10:29.207
In most countries,
like in my country, France,

00:10:29.231 --> 00:10:32.333
we've told our children
that manufacturing had no future.

00:10:32.357 --> 00:10:34.334
That it was something happening far away.

00:10:34.358 --> 00:10:36.156
We need to reverse that

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.576
and teach manufacturing again
at university.

00:10:39.203 --> 00:10:42.688
Only the countries
that will boldly transform

00:10:42.712 --> 00:10:44.734
will be able to seize this growth.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.507
It's also a chance
for developing economies.

00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:54.094
Of course China
and other emerging economies

00:10:54.118 --> 00:10:56.218
won't be the factory of the world anymore.

00:10:57.545 --> 00:11:02.163
Actually, it was not a sustainable
model in the long term,

00:11:02.187 --> 00:11:04.585
as those countries are becoming richer.

00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:10.803
Last year, it was already
as expensive to produce in Brazil

00:11:10.827 --> 00:11:12.170
as to produce in France.

00:11:14.184 --> 00:11:19.941
By 2018, manufacturing costs in China
will be on par with the US.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.601
The new manufacturing revolution

00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:28.405
will accelerate the transition
of those emerging economies

00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:31.651
towards a model driven
by domestic consumption.

00:11:31.675 --> 00:11:32.852
And this is good,

00:11:32.876 --> 00:11:35.233
because this is where growth
will be created.

00:11:35.915 --> 00:11:37.519
In the next five years,

00:11:37.543 --> 00:11:42.847
the next billion consumers in China
will inject more growth in our economies

00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:45.285
than the top five
European markets together.

00:11:47.944 --> 00:11:52.233
This fourth manufacturing revolution
is a chance for all of us.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.000
If we play it right,

00:11:55.024 --> 00:11:58.414
we'll see sustainable growth
in all of our economies.

00:11:58.969 --> 00:12:02.634
This means more wealth
distributed to all of us

00:12:02.658 --> 00:12:05.165
and a better future for our children.

00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:06.340
Thank you.

00:12:06.374 --> 00:12:13.731
(Applause)
