WEBVTT

00:00:01.387 --> 00:00:02.912
I am a palliative care physician

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.927
and I would like to talk to you
today about health care.

00:00:06.393 --> 00:00:10.102
I'd like to talk to you
about the health and care

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:13.764
of the most vulnerable
population in our country --

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:19.039
those people dealing with the most
complex serious health issues.

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:23.004
I'd like to talk to you
about economics as well.

00:00:23.028 --> 00:00:27.484
And the intersection of these two
should scare the hell out of you --

00:00:27.508 --> 00:00:29.279
it scares the hell out of me.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.874
I'd also like to talk to you
about palliative medicine:

00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:40.152
a paradigm of care for this population,
grounded in what they value.

00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:43.741
Patient-centric care based on their values

00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:47.342
that helps this population
live better and longer.

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.808
It's a care model that tells the truth

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:52.984
and engages one-on-one

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:54.829
and meets people where they're at.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.223
I'd like to start by telling the story
of my very first patient.

00:01:01.247 --> 00:01:03.283
It was my first day as a physician,

00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:04.798
with the long white coat ...

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.001
I stumbled into the hospital

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.825
and right away there's a gentleman,
Harold, 68 years old,

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:11.450
came to the emergency department.

00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:13.457
He had had headaches for about six weeks

00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:15.630
that got worse and worse
and worse and worse.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.093
Evaluation revealed he had cancer
that had spread to his brain.

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:26.443
The attending physician directed me
to go share with Harold and his family

00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:31.113
the diagnosis, the prognosis
and options of care.

00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:35.068
Five hours into my new career,

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:37.126
I did the only thing I knew how.

00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:39.206
I walked in,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.134
sat down,

00:01:41.717 --> 00:01:43.137
took Harold's hand,

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:45.290
took his wife's hand

00:01:46.142 --> 00:01:47.419
and just breathed.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.701
He said, "It's not good
news is it, sonny?"

00:01:51.132 --> 00:01:52.540
I said, "No."

00:01:52.564 --> 00:01:55.915
And so we talked
and we listened and we shared.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:58.100
And after a while I said,

00:01:58.124 --> 00:02:01.349
"Harold, what is it
that has meaning to you?

00:02:01.373 --> 00:02:03.002
What is it that you hold sacred?"

00:02:03.026 --> 00:02:04.341
And he said,

00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:05.769
"My family."

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.546
I said, "What do you want to do?"

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.737
He slapped me on the knee
and said, "I want to go fishing."

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:13.632
I said, "That, I know how to do."

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:16.600
Harold went fishing the next day.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.392
He died a week later.

00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:23.074
As I've gone through
my training in my career,

00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:24.585
I think back to Harold.

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.029
And I think that this is a conversation

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:30.966
that happens far too infrequently.

00:02:31.737 --> 00:02:35.502
And it's a conversation
that had led us to crisis,

00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:38.837
to the biggest threat
to the American way of life today,

00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:40.967
which is health care expenditures.

00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:43.103
So what do we know?

00:02:43.127 --> 00:02:46.056
We know that
this population, the most ill,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.664
takes up 15 percent
of the gross domestic product --

00:02:48.688 --> 00:02:51.482
nearly 2.3 trillion dollars.

00:02:52.307 --> 00:02:55.867
So the sickest 15 percent
take up 15 percent of the GDP.

00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:59.056
If we extrapolate this out
over the next two decades

00:02:59.755 --> 00:03:01.746
with the growth of baby boomers,

00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:06.754
at this rate it is 60 percent of the GDP.

00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:10.456
Sixty percent of the gross
domestic product

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.104
of the United States of America --

00:03:12.128 --> 00:03:14.822
it has very little to do
with health care at that point.

00:03:15.148 --> 00:03:16.962
It has to do with a gallon of milk,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.064
with college tuition.

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:22.088
It has to do with
every thing that we value

00:03:22.112 --> 00:03:25.237
and every thing that we know presently.

00:03:26.514 --> 00:03:30.705
It has at stake the free-market
economy and capitalism

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.483
of the United States of America.

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:38.121
Let's forget all the statistics
for a minute, forget the numbers.

00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:41.525
Let's talk about the value we get
for all these dollars we spend.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:45.415
Well, the Dartmouth Atlas,
about six years ago,

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.192
looked at every dollar
spent by Medicare --

00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:49.827
generally this population.

00:03:49.851 --> 00:03:53.787
We found that those patients who have
the highest per capita expenditures

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.425
had the highest suffering,
pain, depression.

00:04:00.182 --> 00:04:02.743
And, more often than not, they die sooner.

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:05.349
How can this be?

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:07.193
We live in the United States,

00:04:07.217 --> 00:04:09.707
it has the greatest health care
system on the planet.

00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.236
We spend 10 times more on these patients

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.446
than the second-leading
country in the world.

00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:16.649
That doesn't make sense.

00:04:17.764 --> 00:04:19.123
But what we know is,

00:04:19.147 --> 00:04:22.318
out of the top 50 countries on the planet

00:04:22.342 --> 00:04:25.925
with organized health care systems,

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.047
we rank 37th.

00:04:30.017 --> 00:04:34.303
Former Eastern Bloc countries
and sub-Saharan African countries

00:04:34.327 --> 00:04:37.863
rank higher than us
as far as quality and value.

00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:43.023
Something I experience
every day in my practice,

00:04:43.047 --> 00:04:47.100
and I'm sure, something many of you
on your own journeys have experienced:

00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:50.807
more is not more.

00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:54.185
Those individuals who had more tests,

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:55.479
more bells, more whistles,

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.931
more chemotherapy,
more surgery, more whatever --

00:04:57.955 --> 00:05:00.404
the more that we do to someone,

00:05:01.283 --> 00:05:03.880
it decreases the quality of their life.

00:05:05.422 --> 00:05:07.693
And it shortens it, most often.

00:05:09.896 --> 00:05:11.721
So what are we going to do about this?

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:13.148
What are we doing about this?

00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:15.073
And why is this so?

00:05:15.097 --> 00:05:17.001
The grim reality, ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.423
is that we, the health care industry --
long white-coat physicians --

00:05:20.447 --> 00:05:21.857
are stealing from you.

00:05:22.877 --> 00:05:25.068
Stealing from you the opportunity

00:05:25.974 --> 00:05:28.334
to choose how you want to live your lives

00:05:28.358 --> 00:05:30.839
in the context of whatever disease it is.

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:33.632
We focus on disease
and pathology and surgery

00:05:33.656 --> 00:05:35.037
and pharmacology.

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.395
We miss the human being.

00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:42.961
How can we treat this

00:05:42.985 --> 00:05:44.778
without understanding this?

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.968
We do things to this;

00:05:50.948 --> 00:05:54.425
we need to do things for this.

00:05:56.161 --> 00:05:57.941
The triple aim of healthcare:

00:05:57.965 --> 00:06:01.057
one, improve patient experience.

00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:04.275
Two, improve the population health.

00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:10.250
Three, decrease per capita expenditure
across a continuum.

00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:13.334
Our group, palliative care,

00:06:13.358 --> 00:06:17.375
in 2012, working with
the sickest of the sick --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.151
cancer,

00:06:20.175 --> 00:06:21.520
heart disease, lung disease,

00:06:22.017 --> 00:06:23.168
renal disease,

00:06:23.192 --> 00:06:24.389
dementia --

00:06:25.681 --> 00:06:27.839
how did we improve patient experience?

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.609
"I want to be at home, Doc."

00:06:30.633 --> 00:06:32.844
"OK, we'll bring the care to you."

00:06:32.868 --> 00:06:34.680
Quality of life, enhanced.

00:06:35.732 --> 00:06:37.090
Think about the human being.

00:06:37.114 --> 00:06:39.045
Two: population health.

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.920
How did we look
at this population differently,

00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:44.792
and engage with them
at a different level, a deeper level,

00:06:44.816 --> 00:06:48.017
and connect to a broader sense
of the human condition than my own?

00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:51.675
How do we manage this group,

00:06:52.584 --> 00:06:54.353
so that of our outpatient population,

00:06:54.377 --> 00:06:59.275
94 percent, in 2012,
never had to go to the hospital?

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.552
Not because they couldn't.

00:07:03.213 --> 00:07:04.998
But they didn't have to.

00:07:05.022 --> 00:07:06.751
We brought the care to them.

00:07:07.356 --> 00:07:11.385
We maintained their value, their quality.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.227
Number three: per capita expenditures.

00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:18.144
For this population,

00:07:18.168 --> 00:07:23.221
that today is 2.3 trillion dollars
and in 20 years is 60 percent of the GDP,

00:07:23.245 --> 00:07:27.979
we reduced health care expenditures
by nearly 70 percent.

00:07:28.873 --> 00:07:32.322
They got more of what they wanted
based on their values,

00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:34.405
lived better and are living longer,

00:07:35.464 --> 00:07:37.233
for two-thirds less money.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.915
While Harold's time was limited,

00:07:45.663 --> 00:07:47.564
palliative care's is not.

00:07:48.288 --> 00:07:52.964
Palliative care is a paradigm
from diagnosis through the end of life.

00:07:54.677 --> 00:07:55.854
The hours,

00:07:56.361 --> 00:07:58.753
weeks, months, years,

00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:01.074
across a continuum --

00:08:01.098 --> 00:08:02.982
with treatment, without treatment.

00:08:03.006 --> 00:08:04.362
Meet Christine.

00:08:05.196 --> 00:08:07.127
Stage III cervical cancer,

00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:10.172
so, metastatic cancer
that started in her cervix,

00:08:10.196 --> 00:08:11.679
spread throughout her body.

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:15.362
She's in her 50s and she is living.

00:08:16.743 --> 00:08:18.336
This is not about end of life,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.875
this is about life.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.070
This is not just about the elderly,

00:08:23.094 --> 00:08:24.756
this is about people.

00:08:25.929 --> 00:08:27.141
This is Richard.

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:29.347
End-stage lung disease.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.853
"Richard, what is it
that you hold sacred?"

00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:36.596
"My kids, my wife and my Harley."

00:08:37.094 --> 00:08:38.105
(Laughter)

00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:39.279
"Alright!

00:08:40.544 --> 00:08:43.782
I can't drive you around on it
because I can barely pedal a bicycle,

00:08:43.806 --> 00:08:45.297
but let's see what we can do."

00:08:46.385 --> 00:08:48.922
Richard came to me,

00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:51.843
and he was in rough shape.

00:08:52.444 --> 00:08:54.225
He had this little voice telling him

00:08:54.249 --> 00:08:56.650
that maybe his time was weeks to months.

00:08:57.488 --> 00:08:58.754
And then we just talked.

00:08:58.778 --> 00:09:02.867
And I listened and tried to hear --

00:09:02.891 --> 00:09:04.178
big difference.

00:09:04.202 --> 00:09:06.371
Use these in proportion to this.

00:09:08.479 --> 00:09:11.004
I said, "Alright, let's take it
one day at a time,"

00:09:11.028 --> 00:09:13.555
like we do in every
other chapter of our life.

00:09:14.573 --> 00:09:18.982
And we have met Richard
where Richard's at day-to-day.

00:09:19.006 --> 00:09:22.028
And it's a phone call or two a week,

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:27.222
but he's thriving in the context
of end-stage lung disease.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.533
Now, palliative medicine is not
just for the elderly,

00:09:33.557 --> 00:09:36.161
it is not just for the middle-aged.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.066
It is for everyone.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.629
Meet my friend Jonathan.

00:09:41.903 --> 00:09:43.383
We have the honor and pleasure

00:09:43.407 --> 00:09:45.727
of Jonathan and his father
joining us here today.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:48.583
Jonathan is in his 20s,
and I met him several years ago.

00:09:48.607 --> 00:09:51.929
He was dealing with
metastatic testicular cancer,

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.952
spread to his brain.

00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:55.647
He had a stroke,

00:09:56.375 --> 00:09:57.923
he had brain surgery,

00:09:57.947 --> 00:09:59.959
radiation, chemotherapy.

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:03.375
Upon meeting him and his family,

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:06.230
he was a couple of weeks away
from a bone marrow transplant,

00:10:06.254 --> 00:10:08.515
and in listening and engaging,

00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:13.585
they said, "Help us
understand -- what is cancer?"

00:10:15.764 --> 00:10:17.417
How did we get this far

00:10:18.513 --> 00:10:20.814
without understanding
what we're dealing with?

00:10:21.276 --> 00:10:23.690
How did we get this far
without empowering somebody

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:25.626
to know what it is they're dealing with,

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.258
and then taking the next step and engaging
in who they are as human beings

00:10:29.282 --> 00:10:31.378
to know if that is what we should do?

00:10:31.402 --> 00:10:34.481
Lord knows we can do
any kind of thing to you.

00:10:37.133 --> 00:10:38.338
But should we?

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.554
And don't take my word for it.

00:10:43.578 --> 00:10:48.030
All the evidence that is related
to palliative care these days

00:10:48.054 --> 00:10:52.175
demonstrates with absolute certainty
people live better and live longer.

00:10:52.199 --> 00:10:55.543
There was a seminal article
out of the New England Journal of Medicine

00:10:55.567 --> 00:10:56.717
in 2010.

00:10:57.621 --> 00:11:00.285
A study done at Harvard
by friends of mine, colleagues.

00:11:00.309 --> 00:11:01.690
End-stage lung cancer:

00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:03.832
one group with palliative care,

00:11:04.695 --> 00:11:06.377
a similar group without.

00:11:07.782 --> 00:11:11.134
The group with palliative care
reported less pain,

00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:13.118
less depression.

00:11:13.556 --> 00:11:16.463
They needed fewer hospitalizations.

00:11:16.487 --> 00:11:17.894
And, ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:22.282
they lived three to six months longer.

00:11:23.805 --> 00:11:27.246
If palliative care were a cancer drug,

00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:31.284
every cancer doctor on the planet
would write a prescription for it.

00:11:32.845 --> 00:11:34.059
Why don't they?

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.914
Again, because we goofy,
long white-coat physicians

00:11:38.938 --> 00:11:42.984
are trained and of the mantra
of dealing with this,

00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:45.635
not with this.

00:11:50.697 --> 00:11:54.441
This is a space that we will
all come to at some point.

00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:58.433
But this conversation today
is not about dying,

00:11:58.457 --> 00:11:59.830
it is about living.

00:12:00.289 --> 00:12:01.613
Living based on our values,

00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:03.056
what we find sacred

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.497
and how we want to write
the chapters of our lives,

00:12:05.521 --> 00:12:07.355
whether it's the last

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:08.776
or the last five.

00:12:10.258 --> 00:12:11.672
What we know,

00:12:12.277 --> 00:12:13.664
what we have proven,

00:12:14.475 --> 00:12:17.012
is that this conversation
needs to happen today --

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.005
not next week, not next year.

00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:22.859
What is at stake is our lives today

00:12:22.883 --> 00:12:24.683
and the lives of us as we get older

00:12:24.707 --> 00:12:27.247
and the lives of our children
and our grandchildren.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.183
Not just in that hospital room

00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:32.117
or on the couch at home,

00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:34.529
but everywhere we go
and everything we see.

00:12:36.326 --> 00:12:41.546
Palliative medicine is the answer
to engage with human beings,

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.024
to change the journey
that we will all face,

00:12:46.304 --> 00:12:47.804
and change it for the better.

00:12:50.148 --> 00:12:51.555
To my colleagues,

00:12:52.823 --> 00:12:54.087
to my patients,

00:12:54.702 --> 00:12:55.876
to my government,

00:12:56.303 --> 00:12:58.362
to all human beings,

00:12:58.386 --> 00:13:01.756
I ask that we stand and we
shout and we demand

00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:04.232
the best care possible,

00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:07.582
so that we can live better today

00:13:07.606 --> 00:13:09.287
and ensure a better life tomorrow.

00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:11.278
We need to shift today

00:13:12.452 --> 00:13:15.333
so that we can live tomorrow.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:17.989
Thank you very much.

00:13:18.013 --> 00:13:19.301
(Applause)
