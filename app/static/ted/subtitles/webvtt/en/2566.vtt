00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.136
In July of 1911,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.416
a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professor
set out from his rainforest camp

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.056
with his team.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.216
After climbing a steep hill

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.656
and wiping the sweat from his brow,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.976
he described what he saw beneath him.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.176
He saw rising from
the dense rainforest foliage

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.776
this incredible interlocking
maze of structures

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.096
built of granite,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.336
beautifully put together.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.976
What's amazing about this project

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.976
is that it was the first funded
by National Geographic,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.920
and it graced the front cover
of its magazine in 1912.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.776
This professor used state-of-the-art
photography equipment

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.456
to record the site,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.976
forever changing the face of exploration.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.936
The site was Machu Picchu,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.960
discovered and explored by Hiram Bingham.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.256
When he saw the site, he asked,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.200
"This is an impossible dream.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.480
What could it be?"

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.696
So today,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.256
100 years later,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.496
I invite you all
on an incredible journey with me,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.416
a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.576
(Cheers)

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.016
We will do nothing less
than use state-of-the-art technology

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.960
to map an entire country.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.696
This is a dream started by Hiram Bingham,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.136
but we are expanding it to the world,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.296
making archaeological exploration
more open, inclusive,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.240
and at a scale simply
not previously possible.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.016
This is why I am so excited

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.136
to share with you all today

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.416
that we will begin
the 2016 TED Prize platform

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.720
in Latin America,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.400
more specifically Peru.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.256
(Applause)

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.640
Thank you.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.496
We will be taking
Hiram Bingham's impossible dream

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.735
and turning it into an amazing future

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.616
that we can all share in together.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.536
So Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.536
It has absolutely stunning jewelry,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.376
like what you can see here.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.416
It has amazing Moche pottery
of human figures.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.256
It has the Nazca Lines

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.240
and amazing textiles.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.656
So as part of the TED Prize platform,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.736
we are going to partnering
with some incredible organizations,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.216
first of all with DigitalGlobe,
the world's largest provider

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.336
of high-resolution
commercial satellite imagery.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.856
They're going to be helping us build out

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.056
this amazing crowdsourcing
platform they have.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.376
Maybe some of you used it

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.656
with the MH370 crash
and search for the airplane.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.856
Of course, they'll also be providing us
with the satellite imagery.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.696
National Geographic will be helping us
with education and of course exploration.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.136
As well, they'll be providing us
with rich content for the platform,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.136
including some of the archival imagery
like you saw at the beginning of this talk

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.696
and some of their documentary footage.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.136
We've already begun
to build and plan the platform,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.416
and I'm just so excited.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.896
So here's the cool part.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.496
My team, headed up by Chase Childs,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.936
is already beginning to look
at some of the satellite imagery.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.176
Of course, what you can see here
is 0.3-meter data.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.416
This is site called Chan Chan
in northern Peru.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.416
It dates to 850 AD.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.816
It's a really amazing city,
but let's zoom in.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.216
This is the type and quality of data
that you all will get to see.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.256
You can see individual structures,
individual buildings.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.656
And we've already begun
to find previously unknown sites.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.336
What we can say already
is that as part of the platform,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.976
you will all help discover
thousands of previously unknown sites,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.496
like this one here,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.816
and this potentially large one here.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.296
Unfortunately, we've also begun
to uncover large-scale looting at sites,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.576
like what you see here.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.616
So many sites in Peru are threatened,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.696
but the great part
is that all of this data

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.736
is going to be shared
with archaeologists on the front lines

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.080
of protecting these sites.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.696
So I was just in Peru,
meeting with their Minister of Culture

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.976
as well as UNESCO.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.176
We'll be collaborating closely with them.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.456
Just so you all know,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.216
the site is going to be
in both English and Spanish,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.255
which is absolutely essential to make sure

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.216
that people in Peru and across
Latin America can participate.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.296
Our main project coprincipal investigator
is the gentleman you see here,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.376
Dr. Luis Jaime Castillo,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.696
professor at Catholic University.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.736
As a respected Peruvian archaeologist
and former vice-minister,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.896
Dr. Castillo will be helping us coordinate
and share the data with archaeologists

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.256
so they can explore
these sites on the ground.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.656
He also runs this amazing
drone mapping program,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.736
some of the images of which
you can see behind me here and here.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.576
And this data will be incorporated
into the platform,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.934
and also he'll be helping to image
some of the new sites you help find.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.376
Our on-the-ground partner

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.576
who will be helping us
with education, outreach,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.505
as well as site preservation components,

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:05.529
is the Sustainable
Preservation Initiative,

00:05:05.553 --> 00:05:07.296
led by Dr. Larry Coben.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.696
Some of you may not be aware

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.816
that some of the world's
poorest communities

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.656
coexist with some of the world's
most well-known archaeological sites.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.136
What SPI does

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.136
is it helps to empower these communities,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.936
in particular women,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.056
with new economic approaches
and business training.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.496
So it helps to teach them
to create beautiful handicrafts

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.496
which are then sold on to tourists.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.696
This empowers the women
to treasure their cultural heritage

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.376
and take ownership of it.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.336
I had the opportunity to spend some time
with 24 of these women

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.976
at a well-known archaeological site
called Pachacamac, just outside Lima.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.416
These women were unbelievably inspiring,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.576
and what's great is that SPI
will help us transform communities

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.000
near some of the sites
that you help to discover.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.936
Peru is just the beginning.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.576
We're going to be expanding
this platform to the world,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.816
but already I've gotten
thousands of emails

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.496
from people all across the world --
professors, educators, students,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.056
and other archaeologists --
who are so excited to help participate.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.696
In fact, they're already suggesting
amazing places for us to help discover,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.576
including Atlantis.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.216
I don't know if we're going
to be looking for Atlantis,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.456
but you never know.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.576
So I'm just so excited
to launch this platform.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.376
It's going to be launched formally
by the end of the year.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.736
And I have to say,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.616
if what my team has already discovered
in the past few weeks are any indication,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.056
what the world discovers
is just going to be beyond imagination.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.136
Make sure to hold on to your alpacas.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.496
Thank you very much.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.336
(Applause)

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.576
Thank you.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.800
(Applause)
