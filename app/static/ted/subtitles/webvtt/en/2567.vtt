00:00:00.888 --> 00:00:03.022
There's a big question
at the center of life

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:04.960
in our democracies today:

00:00:04.984 --> 00:00:08.329
How do we fight terror
without destroying democracies,

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:10.876
without trampling human rights?

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:16.189
I've spent much of my career
working with journalists,

00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:17.371
with bloggers,

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:18.709
with activists,

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.348
with human rights researchers
all around the world,

00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:23.482
and I've come to the conclusion

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:28.151
that if our democratic societies
do not double down

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:31.158
on protecting and defending human rights,

00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:32.582
freedom of the press

00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:35.022
and a free and open internet,

00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:41.793
radical extremist ideologies
are much more likely to persist.

00:00:42.537 --> 00:00:44.982
(Applause)

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:46.690
OK, all done. Thank you very much.

00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:47.873
No, just joking.

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:49.306
(Laughter)

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.609
I actually want to drill down
on this a little bit.

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:58.712
So, one of the countries that has been
on the frontlines of this issue

00:00:58.736 --> 00:00:59.966
is Tunisia,

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:03.841
which was the only country
to come out of the Arab Spring

00:01:03.865 --> 00:01:06.463
with a successful democratic revolution.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:08.232
Five years later,

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:11.092
they're struggling
with serious terror attacks

00:01:11.116 --> 00:01:13.829
and rampant ISIS recruitment.

00:01:13.853 --> 00:01:16.637
And many Tunisians
are calling on their government

00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:19.721
to do whatever it takes to keep them safe.

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:23.714
Tunisian cartoonist Nadia Khiari

00:01:23.738 --> 00:01:28.013
has summed up the situation
with this character who says,

00:01:28.037 --> 00:01:30.616
"I don't give a damn about human rights.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.491
I don't give a damn about the revolution.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:36.971
I don't give a damn
about democracy and liberty.

00:01:37.587 --> 00:01:39.177
I just want to be safe."

00:01:41.672 --> 00:01:44.014
"Satisfied?" asked his jailer.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.205
"You're safe now."

00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:49.696
If the Tunisian people can figure out

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.783
how to deal with their terrorism problem

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:54.229
without ending up in this place,

00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:57.454
they will be a model
not only for their region,

00:01:57.478 --> 00:01:58.846
but for all of us.

00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:04.438
The reality is that civil society,
journalists and activists

00:02:04.462 --> 00:02:09.291
are coming under attack
from extremist groups on the one hand,

00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:11.045
and, in many countries,

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.504
also from their own governments.

00:02:13.528 --> 00:02:16.920
We're seeing bloggers
and journalists being jailed,

00:02:16.944 --> 00:02:18.382
charged and intimidated

00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:19.924
by their own governments,

00:02:19.948 --> 00:02:23.343
many of which are allies
with the West in the war on terror.

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:25.422
Just three examples.

00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:27.302
A friend and former colleague of mine,

00:02:27.326 --> 00:02:28.558
Hisham Almiraat,

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:31.626
has been charged
with threatening state security,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.599
along with six other activists in Morocco.

00:02:35.144 --> 00:02:39.617
The Saudi blogger Raif Badawi
has been jailed and flogged

00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:45.413
for insulting Islam and criticizing
the Saudi regime on his blog.

00:02:45.437 --> 00:02:50.927
More recently, the Turkish representative
for Reporters Without Borders,

00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:52.798
Erol Ã–nderoglu,

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:57.566
has been detained and charged
with spreading terrorist propaganda,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.052
because he and some other activists
have been supporting Kurdish media.

00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:06.712
Anti-terror measures
quickly turn into state repression

00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:09.812
without strong protection
for minority communities

00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:12.338
and for peaceful debate;

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:17.725
this needs to be supported
by a robust, independent local media.

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.053
But while that's not really happening,

00:03:20.077 --> 00:03:24.068
Washington is teaming up
with Silicon Valley and with Hollywood

00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:29.077
to pour millions -- hundreds
of millions of dollars --

00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:31.688
into what's called "counter-messaging,"

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:33.691
a fancy word for propaganda.

00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:40.033
To counter the terrorist propaganda
spreading all over the internet,

00:03:40.614 --> 00:03:44.360
in Europe, Internet Referral
Units are being set up,

00:03:44.384 --> 00:03:48.361
so that people can report
on extremist content that they find

00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:49.792
and get it censored.

00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:51.551
The problem is,

00:03:51.575 --> 00:03:56.180
that all of this propaganda,
monitoring and censorship

00:03:56.204 --> 00:04:00.787
completely fails to make up for the fact

00:04:01.236 --> 00:04:06.310
that the people who are
the most credible voices,

00:04:06.334 --> 00:04:10.419
who can present credible ideas
and alternative solutions

00:04:10.443 --> 00:04:14.544
to real economic, social and political
problems in their community

00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:18.851
that are causing people to turn
to extremism in the first place,

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:21.691
are being silenced
by their own governments.

00:04:22.214 --> 00:04:26.776
This is all adding up to a decrease
in freedom across the world.

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:28.977
Freedom House,

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:31.031
the human rights organization,

00:04:31.055 --> 00:04:35.391
reports that 2015 marks
the 10th straight year in a row

00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:38.471
of decline in freedom worldwide.

00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:40.891
And this is not just
because of the actions

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:42.946
of authoritarian governments.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.467
It's also because democratic governments

00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:49.794
are increasingly cracking
down on dissenters,

00:04:49.818 --> 00:04:50.986
whistle-blowers

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.923
and investigative journalists.

00:04:52.947 --> 00:04:55.381
UN Secretary General
Ban Ki-Moon has warned

00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:59.842
that "preventing extremism and promoting
human rights go hand-in-hand."

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:02.670
It's not to say that governments
shouldn't keep us safe --

00:05:02.694 --> 00:05:03.845
of course they should --

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.464
but we need public oversight, transparency

00:05:06.488 --> 00:05:08.729
and accountability to the rule of law.

00:05:08.753 --> 00:05:09.905
Meanwhile,

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:13.802
extremists are literally killing off
civil society in some countries.

00:05:14.198 --> 00:05:16.732
Since 2013 in Bangladesh,

00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:21.272
over a dozen secular bloggers
and community activists

00:05:21.296 --> 00:05:24.229
have been literally
slaughtered by extremists

00:05:24.253 --> 00:05:26.597
while the government has done very little.

00:05:27.008 --> 00:05:29.955
From the city of Raqqa in Syria,

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.555
people like Ruqia Hassan and Naji Jerf
have been assassinated

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:37.594
for their reporting
out of ISIS-controlled territory.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:43.899
The citizen media group called
Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently

00:05:43.923 --> 00:05:48.142
relies on strong encryption
to send out their reports

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:51.578
and shield themselves
from interception and surveillance.

00:05:52.057 --> 00:05:54.807
Yet authorities in countries
like the United States,

00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:57.374
the United Kingdom
and many other democracies

00:05:57.398 --> 00:05:59.251
are seeking to use the law

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:03.732
to either weaken or outright ban
strong encryption,

00:06:03.756 --> 00:06:05.936
because the bad guys are using it, too.

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:10.725
We have got to fight for the right
of citizens to use strong encryption.

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:14.379
Otherwise, dissent
and investigative journalism

00:06:14.403 --> 00:06:16.802
are going to become even more difficult

00:06:16.826 --> 00:06:18.290
in even more places.

00:06:18.654 --> 00:06:21.125
And the bad guys -- the criminals
and terrorists --

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:23.409
are still going to find
ways to communicate.

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:26.072
Kudos to the companies
that are standing up

00:06:26.096 --> 00:06:28.550
for their users' right to use encryption.

00:06:29.595 --> 00:06:31.861
But when it comes to censorship,

00:06:31.885 --> 00:06:34.196
the picture is much more troubling.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.428
Yes, there's a real problem

00:06:36.452 --> 00:06:39.715
of extremist content
spreading all over the internet.

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:43.272
And Facebook, YouTube and Twitter
are among the many companies

00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:47.723
who report having taken down hundreds
of thousands of pieces of content

00:06:47.747 --> 00:06:49.327
and deactivating accounts

00:06:49.351 --> 00:06:51.831
that are connected
to the extremist's speech.

00:06:51.855 --> 00:06:56.175
The problem is their enforcement
mechanisms are a complete black box,

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:58.187
and there is collateral damage.

00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:00.929
Take, for example, Iyad el-Baghdadi,

00:07:01.516 --> 00:07:04.152
an activist who makes fun
of ISIS on Twitter.

00:07:04.176 --> 00:07:05.992
He had his account deactivated,

00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:09.541
because he shares a surname
with a prominent ISIS leader.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.371
Last December,

00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:13.014
a number of women named Isis,

00:07:13.038 --> 00:07:16.490
which also happens to be
the name of an Egyptian goddess,

00:07:16.514 --> 00:07:18.397
had their accounts deactivated.

00:07:18.742 --> 00:07:20.358
And this woman,

00:07:20.382 --> 00:07:23.487
who lives in the United States
and is a computer programmer,

00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:27.237
reported on Twitter
about her deactivation on Facebook,

00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:30.954
managed to get enough media attention
to have her account reinstated.

00:07:30.978 --> 00:07:33.666
But that's the thing --
she had to get media attention.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.529
And journalists aren't immune.

00:07:35.553 --> 00:07:36.727
David Thomson,

00:07:36.751 --> 00:07:40.149
an expert on terrorism and reporter
for Radio France International,

00:07:40.173 --> 00:07:43.736
had reports deleted
from his Facebook account

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.549
and had his account
deactivated for several days,

00:07:46.573 --> 00:07:50.474
because they contained
pictures of ISIS flags,

00:07:50.498 --> 00:07:52.554
even though he was just reporting on ISIS,

00:07:52.578 --> 00:07:53.756
not promoting it.

00:07:54.253 --> 00:07:57.242
And then we have stories from people
like this Egyptian man,

00:07:57.266 --> 00:07:58.883
Ahmed Abdellahy,

00:07:58.907 --> 00:08:04.050
who reported recently in an event
in Washington DC

00:08:04.074 --> 00:08:06.248
that some of his arguments
with extremists --

00:08:06.272 --> 00:08:12.585
he now spends his time on social media
arguing with ISIS followers,

00:08:12.609 --> 00:08:14.616
trying to get them to turn away --

00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:20.136
some of his arguments
with these extremists get deleted,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.207
which he believes has the effect
of shielding them

00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:25.118
from alternative points of view.

00:08:26.217 --> 00:08:30.602
It's unclear whether Facebook
even knows the extent

00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:32.138
of the collateral damage,

00:08:32.162 --> 00:08:33.994
or the other companies as well.

00:08:34.558 --> 00:08:38.172
But we do know that journalism,
activism and public debate

00:08:38.196 --> 00:08:42.316
are being silenced in the effort
to stamp out extremist speech.

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:47.639
So with these companies having so much
power over the public discourse,

00:08:47.663 --> 00:08:49.257
they need to be held accountable.

00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:52.162
They need to carry out impact assessment

00:08:52.186 --> 00:08:56.703
to identify and fix the problems
that we're clearly seeing.

00:08:56.727 --> 00:09:00.503
They need to be more transparent
about their enforcement mechanisms,

00:09:00.527 --> 00:09:03.929
and they need to have clear
appeal and grievance mechanisms,

00:09:03.953 --> 00:09:06.297
so people can get
their content reinstated.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.833
Now, I've been talking
for the last 10 minutes

00:09:09.857 --> 00:09:13.972
about how governments and companies
are making it more difficult

00:09:13.996 --> 00:09:15.332
for people like these.

00:09:15.356 --> 00:09:18.839
This is a picture of members
of the citizen media network,

00:09:18.863 --> 00:09:20.014
Global Voices,

00:09:20.038 --> 00:09:22.131
that I helped to cofound over 10 years ago

00:09:22.155 --> 00:09:24.151
with my friend, Ethan Zuckerman.

00:09:24.175 --> 00:09:28.645
Interestingly, about 5 years ago,
right after the Arab Spring,

00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:31.326
the data scientist Gilad Lotan

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:36.267
created a network map
of the people in Global Voices

00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:39.213
who were heavy users of Twitter
during the Arab Spring.

00:09:39.237 --> 00:09:44.455
And he found that many of these people
served as key information nodes

00:09:44.479 --> 00:09:46.343
between activists and journalists

00:09:46.367 --> 00:09:49.392
throughout the Tunisian
and Egyptian revolution.

00:09:49.416 --> 00:09:54.127
We've got to make sure
that these people not only survive,

00:09:54.706 --> 00:09:57.192
but are able to continue to thrive.

00:09:57.216 --> 00:09:58.870
Many of them are still active,

00:09:58.894 --> 00:10:00.970
other than the ones who have gone to jail

00:10:00.994 --> 00:10:03.913
or have been driven into hiding or exile.

00:10:04.668 --> 00:10:06.024
All around the world,

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.827
people who are sick and tired
of fear and oppression

00:10:09.851 --> 00:10:13.301
are linking up in their communities
and across borders.

00:10:13.325 --> 00:10:17.588
We've got to do everything we can
to push our governments and companies

00:10:17.612 --> 00:10:20.548
to do a better job
of protecting their rights.

00:10:20.572 --> 00:10:22.557
We've also got to be more mindful

00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:27.426
about how our own personal, political,
consumer and business choices

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.119
affect people like these around the world.

00:10:31.112 --> 00:10:33.544
Also, if you follow the news,

00:10:33.568 --> 00:10:36.836
it's pretty clear that that alone
isn't going to be enough.

00:10:37.694 --> 00:10:41.454
We've got to take personal
responsibility by joining --

00:10:41.478 --> 00:10:44.336
or at very least, actively supporting --

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:48.440
the growing ecosystem
of individuals and groups

00:10:48.464 --> 00:10:50.550
who are fighting for social justice,

00:10:50.574 --> 00:10:52.637
environmental sustainability,

00:10:52.661 --> 00:10:54.224
government accountability,

00:10:54.248 --> 00:10:56.125
human rights, freedom of the press

00:10:56.149 --> 00:10:57.705
and a free and open internet,

00:10:57.729 --> 00:10:59.485
all around the world.

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:04.220
I believe that, ultimately,
we can overcome

00:11:04.244 --> 00:11:10.702
the digitally empowered networks
of extremism, demagoguery and hate.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:12.559
But ...

00:11:13.104 --> 00:11:19.828
we've got to do this by really
beefing up the global networks

00:11:19.852 --> 00:11:21.640
of citizens around the world,

00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:25.444
powered by people
who are working hard every day,

00:11:25.468 --> 00:11:27.233
and taking personal risk

00:11:27.714 --> 00:11:33.164
for a future world that is more
peaceful, just, open and free.

00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:35.070
Thanks very much for listening.

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:43.611
