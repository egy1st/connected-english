00:00:02.063 --> 00:00:04.230
I opened a blind man's head.

00:00:05.363 --> 00:00:09.837
I didn't make him think or reflect --
I cracked his head open, literally.

00:00:10.564 --> 00:00:12.969
We were walking with him
holding onto my shoulder,

00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:15.833
I miscalculated how much space
there was between us,

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:17.622
and I knocked him into a gate.

00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:18.813
(Laughter)

00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:20.806
Five stitches in his forehead.

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:24.936
At that moment, I felt like
the worst teacher in the world.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.068
I really didn't know how to apologize.

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:33.556
Luckily, El Pulga is one of those people
who takes things quite well.

00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:36.752
And to this day, he says
that I was the coach

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:39.220
who left the most important
mark on his career.

00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:41.417
(Laughter)

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.723
The truth is, when I started working
at the institute for the blind,

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:46.499
I was surprised by a lot of things.

00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:50.450
A lot of the things they did,
I never imagined they could:

00:00:50.474 --> 00:00:54.396
they swam, did exercise, played cards.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.624
They drank mate, and could pour it

00:00:56.648 --> 00:00:58.712
without burning themselves in the process.

00:00:58.736 --> 00:01:00.529
But when I saw them playing soccer --

00:01:00.553 --> 00:01:01.965
that was amazing.

00:01:02.672 --> 00:01:06.547
They had a dirt field,
rusty goalposts and broken nets.

00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:10.201
The blind who attended the institute
would play their games there,

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:12.800
just like I did at a field near my house.

00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:14.916
But they played without being able to see.

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:19.015
The ball made a sound
so they could locate it.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.050
They had a guide
behind the rival team's goal

00:01:22.074 --> 00:01:24.078
to know where to kick the ball.

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:25.980
And they used eye masks.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:28.240
There were guys
who could still see a little,

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:31.419
and they wore eye masks
so everyone was equal.

00:01:32.524 --> 00:01:37.176
When I was more at ease with them,
I asked for a mask myself.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.846
I put it on and tried to play.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.567
I had played soccer all my life.

00:01:42.272 --> 00:01:44.318
This is where it got even more amazing:

00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:47.162
within two seconds, I didn't know
where I was standing.

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:53.880
I had studied physical education
because I loved high performance.

00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:56.119
I started working
at the institute by chance.

00:01:56.143 --> 00:01:58.990
My other job was with the Argentinian
National Rowing Team,

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:00.669
and I felt that was my thing.

00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:03.065
Here, everything was twice as hard.

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:07.540
I'll never forget the first day
I did the warm-up with the team.

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:09.276
I lined them up in front of me --

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.169
I used to do that with the rowing team --

00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:15.448
and I said, "OK, everyone
bend down," going like this.

00:02:15.472 --> 00:02:17.414
When I looked up, two guys were seated,

00:02:17.438 --> 00:02:19.747
three were lying down
and others were squatting.

00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:21.137
(Laughter)

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:24.523
How could I do here
the same things I was doing there?

00:02:26.907 --> 00:02:28.290
It took me a while.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.778
I started looking for tools
to learn from them,

00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:34.370
from the teachers who worked with them.

00:02:34.394 --> 00:02:39.040
I learned I couldn't explain a play
on a chalkboard like a coach does,

00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:41.844
but I could use a plastic tray
and some bottle caps

00:02:41.868 --> 00:02:44.237
so they could follow me by way of touch.

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.932
I also learned they could run on a track

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:49.979
if I ran with them, holding a rope.

00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:53.823
So we started looking for volunteers
to help us run with them.

00:02:54.312 --> 00:02:56.381
I was enjoying it,

00:02:57.764 --> 00:03:01.056
and finding purpose and meaning
in what we were doing.

00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:03.907
It was hard at first,
it was uncomfortable,

00:03:03.931 --> 00:03:06.074
but I decided to overcome the discomfort.

00:03:06.098 --> 00:03:07.520
And there came a time

00:03:07.544 --> 00:03:10.308
when it became the most
fascinating job I'd ever had.

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.606
I think that's when I wondered:

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.854
Why couldn't we be
a high-performance team as well?

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:20.699
Of course, one thing was missing:

00:03:20.723 --> 00:03:22.793
I needed to find out what they wanted,

00:03:22.817 --> 00:03:25.396
the real protagonists of this story.

00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:30.325
Three hours of training,
playing soccer on that field,

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.960
were not going to be enough.

00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:34.119
We would have to train differently.

00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:37.882
We started to train harder,
and the results were great;

00:03:37.906 --> 00:03:39.195
they asked for more.

00:03:39.733 --> 00:03:41.855
I came to understand
that they, too, wondered

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.787
why they couldn't do high-performance.

00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:49.150
When we felt ready,
we knocked at CENARD's door.

00:03:49.174 --> 00:03:51.914
CENARD is the National Center
for High-Performance Sports

00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:53.282
here in Argentina.

00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:55.723
It was hard to get them
to hear what we had to say.

00:03:55.747 --> 00:03:58.203
But it was considerably more difficult

00:03:58.227 --> 00:04:01.993
to get the other athletes training there
to consider us their equals.

00:04:02.662 --> 00:04:04.598
In fact, they would let us use the field

00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:06.835
only when no other teams were using it.

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:09.311
And we were known as "the blind ones."

00:04:09.724 --> 00:04:12.269
Not everyone knew
exactly what we were doing there.

00:04:13.622 --> 00:04:17.663
The 2006 World Championship
was a turning point in the team's history.

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.233
It was held in Buenos Aires
for the first time.

00:04:21.257 --> 00:04:24.056
It was our chance to show everyone

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.003
what we had been doing all that time.

00:04:26.947 --> 00:04:28.494
We made it to the finals.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.741
We were growing as a team.

00:04:31.374 --> 00:04:33.393
It was us against Brazil in the finals.

00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:36.612
They were the best team in the tournament.

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:39.176
They won every game by a landslide.

00:04:40.264 --> 00:04:44.803
Hardly anyone believed
we could win that game.

00:04:45.942 --> 00:04:47.689
Hardly anyone -- except for us.

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:50.809
During pre-game meetings,

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:52.476
in the locker room,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.901
during each warm-up,

00:04:54.592 --> 00:04:56.127
it smelled of victory.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.531
I swear that smell exists.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:03.055
I smelled it several times with the team,

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:06.355
but I remember it in particular,
the day before we played that final.

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:10.440
The Argentine Football Association
had opened their doors to us.

00:05:10.464 --> 00:05:11.930
We were training at AFA,

00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:14.448
where VerÃ³n, Higuain and Messi trained.

00:05:14.472 --> 00:05:15.881
For the first time ever,

00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:19.461
we felt like a true national team.

00:05:20.214 --> 00:05:22.671
At 7:30pm, the day before the game,

00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:26.523
we were in the lounge discussing strategy,

00:05:26.547 --> 00:05:29.762
and a waiter knocks on the door,
interrupting our conversation.

00:05:30.646 --> 00:05:32.330
He suggested we go to church.

00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:34.154
He came to invite us to church.

00:05:35.253 --> 00:05:39.115
I tried to get rid of him,
saying it wasn't a good time,

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.968
that we better leave it for another day.

00:05:41.992 --> 00:05:47.483
He kept insisting, asking me to please
let him take the guys to church,

00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:50.729
because that day, a pastor
who performed miracles would be there.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.792
I was slightly afraid to ask
what type of miracles he meant,

00:05:55.816 --> 00:05:58.052
and he replied nonchalantly,

00:05:58.076 --> 00:06:00.276
"Coach, let me take
the team to the church,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.653
and when we return, I guarantee
that half of them will be able to see."

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.177
(Laughter)

00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:10.101
Some of the guys laughed,

00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:13.275
but imagine being a blind person
and someone says that to you.

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:14.684
I didn't know what to say.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.352
I said nothing; it was an awkward silence.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:19.120
I didn't want to make him feel bad,

00:06:19.144 --> 00:06:21.318
because he truly believed
this could happen.

00:06:22.032 --> 00:06:23.994
One of the players saved me,

00:06:24.694 --> 00:06:26.640
when he stood up and confidently said,

00:06:26.664 --> 00:06:28.548
"Juan," -- that was the kid's name --

00:06:28.572 --> 00:06:31.525
Gonza already told you
it's not the best time to go to church.

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:33.330
Besides, let me make this clear:

00:06:33.354 --> 00:06:37.236
if we go to that church, and I end up
being able to see when we return,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.278
I will beat you so hard
if I can't play tomorrow."

00:06:40.302 --> 00:06:42.006
(Laughter)

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:48.891
(Applause)

00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:56.942
Juan left, laughing in resignation,

00:06:56.966 --> 00:06:59.012
and we continued with our pregame talk.

00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:02.580
That night when I went to sleep,

00:07:02.604 --> 00:07:05.925
I began to dream
about the next day's game,

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:08.628
imagining what could happen,
how we would play.

00:07:08.652 --> 00:07:11.108
And that's when I noticed
that smell of victory

00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:12.346
I mentioned a while ago.

00:07:12.806 --> 00:07:14.969
And it's because
at that moment, I thought:

00:07:14.993 --> 00:07:19.676
if the other players had the same desire
as Diego going into the game,

00:07:20.261 --> 00:07:22.261
it was impossible for us not to win.

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:25.961
The next day was going to be wonderful.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.502
We got up at 9am, the game was at 7pm,

00:07:29.526 --> 00:07:31.747
and we were already eager to play.

00:07:32.227 --> 00:07:38.092
We left AFA, and the bus was full
of flags that people had given to us.

00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:40.767
We were talking about the game,

00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:43.331
and we could hear people
honking and cheering,

00:07:43.355 --> 00:07:46.665
"Go MurciÃ©lagos! Today's the day!
The final challenge!"

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:50.410
The guys asked me, "Do they know us?
Do they know we're playing?"

00:07:51.134 --> 00:07:54.542
Some people followed the bus to CENARD.

00:07:55.237 --> 00:07:58.827
We arrived and found an amazing scene.

00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:02.313
In the corridor leading
from the locker room to the game field,

00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:04.289
I was walking with Silvio,

00:08:04.313 --> 00:08:07.401
who was holding onto my shoulder,
so I could guide him.

00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:09.688
Fortunately, there were
no gates along the way.

00:08:09.712 --> 00:08:10.712
(Laughter)

00:08:10.736 --> 00:08:13.848
When we reached the field,
he asked me about everything.

00:08:13.872 --> 00:08:15.808
He didn't want to miss a single detail.

00:08:15.832 --> 00:08:19.651
He said, "Tell me what you see,
tell me who's playing the drums."

00:08:19.675 --> 00:08:23.570
I tried to explain what was happening
with as much detail as possible.

00:08:23.594 --> 00:08:28.394
I told him, "The stands are packed,
a lot of people couldn't get in,

00:08:28.418 --> 00:08:31.012
there are blue and white balloons
all over the field,

00:08:31.036 --> 00:08:35.177
they're opening a giant Argentine flag
that covers the entire grandstand."

00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:37.298
Suddenly, he cuts me off and says,

00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:41.157
"Do you see a flag that says 'San Pedro'?"

00:08:42.674 --> 00:08:44.279
That's the city where he lives.

00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:46.456
I started looking into the stands

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.989
and I spotted a little white flag

00:08:49.013 --> 00:08:52.063
with lettering done
in black spray paint, that read:

00:08:52.087 --> 00:08:55.690
"Silvio, your family
and all of San Pedro are here."

00:08:56.227 --> 00:08:58.959
I told him that and he replied,

00:08:58.983 --> 00:09:03.032
"That's my mom, tell me where
she is, I want to I wave at her."

00:09:03.564 --> 00:09:04.996
I pointed him toward the flag

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.566
and showed him with his arm
where they were sitting,

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.574
and he waved his arms in that direction.

00:09:09.598 --> 00:09:12.689
About 20 or 30 people stood up
and gave him an ovation.

00:09:13.341 --> 00:09:14.730
When that happened,

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:17.079
I saw how his face changed,
how moved he was.

00:09:17.615 --> 00:09:19.461
It was moving for me, too;

00:09:20.106 --> 00:09:22.296
two seconds later,
I had a lump in my throat.

00:09:23.318 --> 00:09:26.604
It was strange -- I felt both
the excitement of what was happening,

00:09:26.628 --> 00:09:29.786
and the anger and the anguish
that he could not see it.

00:09:31.457 --> 00:09:36.540
A few days later when I told him
what I had experienced,

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:40.510
he tried to reassure me, saying,

00:09:40.534 --> 00:09:43.111
"Gonza, don't feel bad, I could see them.

00:09:43.135 --> 00:09:45.852
Differently, but I swear to you
that I saw them all."

00:09:47.248 --> 00:09:48.644
The game started.

00:09:48.668 --> 00:09:51.506
We could not fail; it was the final.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.955
The audience was quiet, like here,

00:09:53.979 --> 00:09:55.623
because in soccer for the blind,

00:09:55.647 --> 00:09:58.646
the public has to be quiet
so the players can hear the ball.

00:09:59.064 --> 00:10:01.813
They're only allowed to cheer
when the game is over.

00:10:02.265 --> 00:10:04.906
And when there were eight minutes to go,

00:10:05.747 --> 00:10:09.194
the crowd did all the cheering
they hadn't done in the first 32 minutes.

00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:12.847
When pigeon-toed Silvio
nailed the ball at an angle,

00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:14.959
they cheered with all their heart,

00:10:14.983 --> 00:10:16.557
in an incredible way.

00:10:18.848 --> 00:10:23.466
Today, if you go to CENARD,
you'll see a huge poster on the door,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.411
with a photo of our team,
Los MurciÃ©lagos.

00:10:26.227 --> 00:10:30.871
They're a model national team,
everyone in CENARD knows who they are,

00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:33.478
and after having won
two World Championships

00:10:33.502 --> 00:10:34.899
and two Paralympic medals,

00:10:34.923 --> 00:10:37.382
no one doubts they are
high-performance athletes.

00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:44.055
(Applause)

00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:54.001
(Applause ends)

00:10:55.148 --> 00:10:58.836
I was lucky to train
this team for 10 years,

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.052
first as a trainer
and later as their coach.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.969
I feel that they've given me much more

00:11:07.993 --> 00:11:09.412
than what I've given them.

00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:16.236
Last year, they asked me to coach
another national team, Power Soccer.

00:11:17.394 --> 00:11:21.228
It's a national team of young men
who play soccer in wheelchairs.

00:11:21.824 --> 00:11:24.871
They use motorized wheelchairs
that they drive with a joystick,

00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:27.453
because they don't have
enough strength in their arms

00:11:27.477 --> 00:11:28.770
to use conventional chairs.

00:11:28.794 --> 00:11:32.504
They added a bumper to the chair,
a safeguard that protects their feet,

00:11:32.528 --> 00:11:34.647
while allowing them to kick the ball.

00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:39.715
It's the first time that, instead
of being the spectators,

00:11:39.739 --> 00:11:41.556
they're now the main characters.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.790
It's the first time their parents,
friends and siblings can see them play.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.103
For me, it's a new challenge,

00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:53.371
with the same discomfort,
insecurity, and fear I had

00:11:53.395 --> 00:11:55.371
when I started working with the blind.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.577
But I approach it all
from a more experienced position.

00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:03.803
That's why from day one,
I treat them as athletes on the field,

00:12:03.827 --> 00:12:06.437
and off the field, I try
to put myself in their shoes

00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:07.888
and behave without prejudice,

00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:11.869
because treating them naturally
feels best to them.

00:12:13.326 --> 00:12:17.714
Both teams play soccer;
something once unthinkable for them.

00:12:18.303 --> 00:12:22.059
They had to adapt the rules to do so.

00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:25.653
And both teams broke the same rule --

00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:28.449
the one that said
they couldn't play soccer.

00:12:29.589 --> 00:12:33.813
When you see them play,
you see competition, not disability.

00:12:34.568 --> 00:12:37.722
The problem starts when the game is over,

00:12:37.746 --> 00:12:39.221
and they leave the field.

00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:41.741
Then they step in to play our game,

00:12:41.765 --> 00:12:45.719
in a society whose rules
don't really take them into account

00:12:45.743 --> 00:12:46.908
or care for them.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.340
I learned from sports

00:12:49.364 --> 00:12:52.996
that disability greatly depends on
the rules of the game.

00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:57.576
I believe that if we change
some of the rules of our game,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.882
we can make life a little easier for them.

00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:06.089
We all know there are people
with disabilities; we see them daily.

00:13:06.644 --> 00:13:09.605
But by having no direct contact with them,

00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:13.179
we're not aware of the problems
they face every day,

00:13:13.203 --> 00:13:15.310
like how hard it is for them
to get on a bus,

00:13:15.334 --> 00:13:16.985
find a job,

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:18.162
take the subway

00:13:18.186 --> 00:13:19.336
or cross the street.

00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:23.538
It's true that there is an increasing
social responsibility

00:13:23.562 --> 00:13:27.408
regarding the inclusion
of people with disabilities.

00:13:28.466 --> 00:13:30.959
But I think it's still not enough.

00:13:30.983 --> 00:13:34.022
I think change needs to come
from every one of us.

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:37.692
First, by leaving behind
our indifference toward the disabled,

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:41.067
and then by respecting the rules
that do take them into account.

00:13:41.091 --> 00:13:42.848
They are few, but they do exist.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:48.158
I cracked a blind man's head
open -- El Pulga's head.

00:13:48.669 --> 00:13:52.523
I can assure you these two teams
opened mine as well.

00:13:52.547 --> 00:13:53.984
They taught me that above all,

00:13:54.008 --> 00:13:56.132
you have to get out there
and play every game

00:13:56.156 --> 00:13:58.386
in this beautiful tournament
that we call life.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.566
Thank you.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:05.642
(Applause)
