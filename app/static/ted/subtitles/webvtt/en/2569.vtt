00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:02.983
I once had this nightmare:

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:06.908
I'm standing in the middle
of a deserted field full of land mines.

00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:10.036
In real life, I love to hike,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.729
but every time I want to go on a hike,
it makes me nervous.

00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:16.851
I have this thought in the back of my mind

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.389
that I might lose a limb.

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:22.101
This underlying fear started 10 years ago,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.423
after I met Mohammed,
a cluster bomb survivor

00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:29.383
of the summer 2006
Israel-Hezbollah War in Lebanon.

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:33.557
Mohammed, like so many
other survivors all around the world,

00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:38.568
had to live through the horrifying
repercussions of cluster munitions

00:00:38.592 --> 00:00:40.184
on a daily basis.

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:43.761
When the one-month conflict
started in Lebanon,

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:47.098
I was still working
at Agence France-Presse in Paris.

00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:50.439
I remember how I was glued to the screens,

00:00:50.463 --> 00:00:52.648
anxiously following the news.

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:54.838
I wanted to reassure myself

00:00:54.862 --> 00:00:57.741
that the falling bombs
missed my parents' home.

00:00:58.773 --> 00:01:02.311
When I arrived in Beirut
on assignment to cover that war,

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:04.803
I was relieved to be united
with my family,

00:01:04.827 --> 00:01:07.950
after they had finally managed
to escape southern Lebanon.

00:01:08.744 --> 00:01:10.543
The day the war was over,

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:12.718
I remember seeing this image --

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:14.185
one of blocked roads,

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:18.338
of displaced people eagerly rushing
south, back to their homes,

00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:20.457
regardless of what they would find.

00:01:21.374 --> 00:01:24.444
An estimated four million
cluster submunitions

00:01:24.468 --> 00:01:28.104
were spread in Lebanon during
the 34-day conflict.

00:01:30.462 --> 00:01:34.001
Mohammed lost both legs
during the last week of the conflict.

00:01:34.826 --> 00:01:37.877
The fact that he lives a five-minute
drive from my parents' home

00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:40.656
made it easier to follow
him through the years.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.660
It was now almost 10 years
since we first met.

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:45.860
I saw the young boy

00:01:45.884 --> 00:01:49.764
who had to endure
physical and emotional trauma.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:53.609
I saw the teenager who tried
to offer his friends tattoos,

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:56.186
in return for a set fee of five dollars.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.313
And I know the young, jobless man
who spends hours surfing the Internet

00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:04.430
trying to meet a girl who might
become his girlfriend.

00:02:05.408 --> 00:02:08.922
His fate and the effects
of losing his legs

00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:10.943
are now his daily reality.

00:02:11.578 --> 00:02:13.967
Survivors of bomb trauma like Mohammed

00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:17.444
have to deal with so many details
that never occur to us.

00:02:17.817 --> 00:02:18.993
Who would have imagined

00:02:19.017 --> 00:02:21.752
that so many daily tasks we do
or take for granted,

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:26.029
such as going to the beach or even
picking up something from the floor,

00:02:26.053 --> 00:02:29.077
would become sources
of stress and anxiety?

00:02:29.886 --> 00:02:32.197
Well, that's what eventually
became of Mohammed,

00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:34.963
due to his inflexible prosthetic legs.

00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:40.135
Ten years ago, I had no clue
what a cluster bomb was,

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.447
nor its horrifying implications.

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:45.272
I learned that this indiscriminate
weapon was used

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:46.811
in so many parts of the world

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.107
and continues to kill on a regular basis,

00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:52.170
without distinguishing
between a military target

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:53.366
or a child.

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:55.982
I naively asked myself,

00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:59.385
"But seriously, who made those weapons?

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:01.200
And what for?"

00:03:01.687 --> 00:03:04.155
Let me explain to you
what a cluster bomb is.

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.353
It's a large canister
filled with bomblets.

00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:09.040
When it's dropped from the air,

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:13.164
it opens up in midair to release
hundreds of bomblets.

00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:15.750
They scatter around wide areas

00:03:15.774 --> 00:03:16.927
and on impact,

00:03:16.951 --> 00:03:18.634
many fail to explode.

00:03:19.348 --> 00:03:22.569
Those unexploded ones end up
just like landmines --

00:03:22.593 --> 00:03:23.826
sitting on the ground,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.821
waiting for their next target.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.014
If someone steps on them by accident

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:30.196
or picks them up,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.678
they can explode.

00:03:32.283 --> 00:03:35.166
These weapons are extremely unpredictable,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.219
which makes the threat even bigger.

00:03:37.243 --> 00:03:40.342
One day, a farmer can work
his land without a problem.

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:44.321
The next day, he can make fire
and burn some branches,

00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:48.135
and the submunitions close by
could be set off because of the heat.

00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:52.311
The problem is children mistake
those bomblets for toys,

00:03:52.335 --> 00:03:55.686
because they can look like
bouncy balls or soda cans.

00:03:56.943 --> 00:03:58.809
Being a documentary photographer,

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:02.972
I decided to go back to Lebanon
a few months after the conflict ended

00:04:02.996 --> 00:04:04.969
to meet cluster bomb survivors.

00:04:04.993 --> 00:04:06.144
And I met a few --

00:04:06.168 --> 00:04:07.741
Hussein and Rasha,

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:09.766
who both lost a leg to submunitions.

00:04:10.143 --> 00:04:14.359
Their stories are similar to so many
other kids' stories across the world

00:04:14.383 --> 00:04:17.432
and are a testimony
to the horrifying implications

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:20.286
of the continuous use of such weapons.

00:04:21.332 --> 00:04:24.917
That's when I met Mohammed,
in January 2007.

00:04:25.427 --> 00:04:26.707
He was 11 years old,

00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:30.245
and I met him exactly four months
after his accident.

00:04:30.777 --> 00:04:31.928
When I first saw him,

00:04:31.952 --> 00:04:34.071
he was going through painful physiotherapy

00:04:34.095 --> 00:04:36.071
to recover from his fresh wounds.

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:38.819
Still in shock at such a young age,

00:04:38.843 --> 00:04:42.337
Mohammed was struggling
to get used to his new body.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.960
He would even wake up sometimes
at night wanting to scratch his lost feet.

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:51.876
What drew me closer to his story
was my instant realization

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.466
of the difficulties Mohammed
was likely to face in the future --

00:04:55.997 --> 00:04:59.322
that what he has been suffering
while adjusting to his injury

00:04:59.346 --> 00:05:01.016
at the age of 11,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.656
would increase manyfold.

00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:05.361
Even before his disability,

00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:07.602
Mohammed's life wasn't easy.

00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:10.906
He was born in the Rashidieh Camp
for Palestinian refugees,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.079
and this is where he still lives.

00:05:13.103 --> 00:05:16.825
Lebanon holds some 400,000
Palestinian refugees,

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.147
and they suffer from discriminatory laws.

00:05:19.662 --> 00:05:22.235
They're not allowed to work
in the public sector

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.242
or practice certain professions

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:27.254
and are denied the right to own property.

00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:28.533
This is one of the reasons

00:05:28.557 --> 00:05:31.300
why Mohammed doesn't really
regret dropping out of school

00:05:31.324 --> 00:05:32.996
right after his injury.

00:05:33.397 --> 00:05:36.936
He said, "What's the point
of a university degree

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.123
when I can't find a job to start with?"

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:45.260
Cluster bomb use creates a vicious circle
of impact on communities,

00:05:45.284 --> 00:05:47.969
and not only the lives of their victims.

00:05:47.993 --> 00:05:51.808
Many who get injured by this weapon
drop out of school,

00:05:51.832 --> 00:05:54.269
can't find jobs or even lose their jobs,

00:05:54.293 --> 00:05:57.490
therefore losing the ability
to provide for their families.

00:05:57.887 --> 00:06:01.214
This is not to mention
the continuous physical pain

00:06:01.238 --> 00:06:04.343
and the experience of feeling isolated.

00:06:05.512 --> 00:06:08.600
These weapons affect
the poorest of the poor.

00:06:08.624 --> 00:06:11.503
The high medical cost
is a burden to the families.

00:06:11.884 --> 00:06:14.931
They end up relying
on humanitarian agencies,

00:06:14.955 --> 00:06:17.484
which is insufficient and unsustainable,

00:06:17.508 --> 00:06:21.150
especially when injuries require
lifelong support to the injured.

00:06:21.704 --> 00:06:23.542
Ten years after Mohammed's injury,

00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:27.285
he is still unable to afford
proper prosthetic legs.

00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:29.661
He's very cautious with his steps,

00:06:29.685 --> 00:06:31.703
as a couple of falls over the years

00:06:31.727 --> 00:06:34.147
brought him embarrassment
among his friends.

00:06:35.218 --> 00:06:37.297
He joked that since he doesn't have legs,

00:06:37.321 --> 00:06:39.977
some days he tries to walk on his hands.

00:06:41.054 --> 00:06:44.412
One of the worst yet invisible
impacts of the weapon

00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:46.988
is the psychological scars it leaves.

00:06:47.348 --> 00:06:49.664
In one of Mohammed's
early medical reports,

00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:52.731
he was diagnosed with signs of PTSD.

00:06:52.755 --> 00:06:57.987
He suffered from anxiety,
poor appetite, sleep disturbance

00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:00.422
and showed signs of anger.

00:07:01.197 --> 00:07:05.811
The reality is Mohammed never received
proper help to fully recover.

00:07:06.271 --> 00:07:10.487
His current obsession
is to leave Lebanon at any cost --

00:07:10.511 --> 00:07:13.376
even if it meant embarking
on a hazardous journey

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.979
along with refugees drifting towards
Europe today through the Mediterranean.

00:07:19.034 --> 00:07:21.295
Knowing how risky such a journey would be,

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:24.439
he said, "If I were to die on the way,

00:07:24.463 --> 00:07:25.723
it doesn't matter."

00:07:25.747 --> 00:07:28.863
To Mohammed, he is dead here, anyway.

00:07:30.294 --> 00:07:33.302
Cluster bombs are a world problem,

00:07:33.326 --> 00:07:37.987
as this munition keeps destroying
and hurting whole communities

00:07:38.011 --> 00:07:39.714
for generations to come.

00:07:40.618 --> 00:07:44.132
In an online interview with the director
of the Mines Advisory Group,

00:07:44.156 --> 00:07:45.307
Jamie Franklin,

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:46.487
he said,

00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:51.063
"The US forces dropped over two million
tons of munitions over Laos.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.255
If they couldn't find
their targets in Vietnam,

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:58.576
there were free-drop areas in Laos
where planes would drop their loads

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.595
before going back to base,

00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:03.656
because it's dangerous to land
with loaded planes."

00:08:04.653 --> 00:08:07.415
According to the International
Committee of the Red Cross,

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:10.795
in Laos alone -- one of the poorest
countries in the world --

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:15.632
nine to 27 million unexploded
submunitions remain.

00:08:16.238 --> 00:08:21.171
Some 11,000 people have been killed
or injured since 1973.

00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:27.579
This lethal weapon has been used
by over 20 states during armed conflicts

00:08:27.603 --> 00:08:29.761
in over 35 countries,

00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:33.213
such as Ukraine, Iraq and Sudan.

00:08:34.403 --> 00:08:38.689
So far, 119 states have joined
an international treaty

00:08:38.713 --> 00:08:40.424
banning cluster bombs,

00:08:40.448 --> 00:08:43.487
which is officially called
the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

00:08:44.417 --> 00:08:47.867
But some of the biggest producers
of cluster munitions --

00:08:47.891 --> 00:08:51.230
namely, the United States,
Russia and China --

00:08:51.254 --> 00:08:53.724
remain outside of this lifesaving treaty

00:08:53.748 --> 00:08:55.685
and continue to produce them,

00:08:55.709 --> 00:08:58.528
reserve the right to produce
them in the future,

00:08:58.552 --> 00:09:01.278
keep those harmful weapons
in their stockpiles

00:09:01.302 --> 00:09:04.490
and even possibly use them in the future.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.712
Cluster bombs have reportedly
been used most recently

00:09:09.736 --> 00:09:13.123
in the ongoing conflicts
in Yemen and Syria.

00:09:14.122 --> 00:09:16.885
According to research
on the worldwide investments

00:09:16.909 --> 00:09:18.535
in cluster munitions producers

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:20.642
by Pax, a Dutch-based NGO,

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.256
financial institutions invested
billions of US dollars

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.063
into companies that make
cluster munitions.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.508
The majority of these institutions
are based in countries

00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:36.053
that have not yet signed
the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

00:09:37.114 --> 00:09:39.141
Getting back to Mohammed,

00:09:39.165 --> 00:09:42.815
one of the few jobs he was able
to find was picking lemons.

00:09:43.505 --> 00:09:47.067
When I ask him if it's safe
to work in the field he said,

00:09:47.091 --> 00:09:48.300
"I'm not sure."

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:53.691
Research shows that cluster munitions
often contaminate areas

00:09:53.715 --> 00:09:56.957
where agriculture is the main
source of income.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.890
According to Handicap
International's research,

00:10:00.914 --> 00:10:06.892
98 percent of those killed or injured
by cluster munitions are civilians.

00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:10.689
Eighty-four percent
of casualties are males.

00:10:11.074 --> 00:10:13.807
In countries where
these people have no choice

00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:15.887
but to work in those fields,

00:10:15.911 --> 00:10:17.567
they simply do it

00:10:17.591 --> 00:10:18.823
and risk it.

00:10:19.914 --> 00:10:22.982
Mohammed is the only male
to three sisters.

00:10:23.006 --> 00:10:26.332
Culturally, he's expected
to provide for his family,

00:10:26.356 --> 00:10:27.765
but he simply can't.

00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:30.201
He tried to have so many different jobs,

00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:33.791
but he couldn't keep any
due to his physical disability

00:10:33.815 --> 00:10:37.280
and the less-than-friendly environment
to people with disabilities,

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:38.525
to say the least.

00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:42.911
It hurts him a lot when he goes
out looking for a job,

00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:44.128
and he's turned away

00:10:44.152 --> 00:10:46.817
with a small amount of money
paid to him out of pity.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.381
He said, "I'm not here to beg for money,

00:10:50.405 --> 00:10:52.113
I just want to earn it."

00:10:53.764 --> 00:10:56.182
Mohammed today is 21 years old.

00:10:56.206 --> 00:10:57.404
He's illiterate,

00:10:57.428 --> 00:11:00.497
and he communicates with voice messages.

00:11:00.521 --> 00:11:02.274
Here is one of his messages.

00:11:03.234 --> 00:11:08.209
(Audio) Mohammed: (Speaking in Arabic)

00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:13.900
Laura Boushnak:
He said, "My dream is to run,

00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:16.101
and I'm pretty sure once I start running,

00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:17.635
I would never stop."

00:11:17.659 --> 00:11:18.842
Thank you.

00:11:18.866 --> 00:11:23.690
(Applause)
