00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:03.603
Imagine that you're a pig farmer.

00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:07.077
You live on a small farm
in the Philippines.

00:00:07.101 --> 00:00:10.760
Your animals are your family's
sole source of income --

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:12.685
as long as they're healthy.

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.079
You know that any day,

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:16.323
one of your pigs can catch the flu,

00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:17.694
the swine flu.

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:20.989
Living in tight quarters,
one pig coughing and sneezing

00:00:21.013 --> 00:00:23.953
may soon lead to the next pig
coughing and sneezing,

00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:27.352
until an outbreak of swine flu
has taken over your farm.

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:29.530
If it's a bad enough virus,

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:32.726
the health of your herd may be gone
in the blink of an eye.

00:00:33.256 --> 00:00:34.900
If you called in a veterinarian,

00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:37.407
he or she would visit your farm
and take samples

00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:39.255
from your pigs' noses and mouths.

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:42.106
But then they would have to drive
back into the city

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.929
to test those samples
in their central lab.

00:00:45.556 --> 00:00:48.159
Two weeks later,
you'd hear back the results.

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:52.687
Two weeks may be just enough time
for infection to spread

00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:54.799
and take away your way of life.

00:00:55.616 --> 00:00:57.387
But it doesn't have to be that way.

00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:00.668
Today, farmers can take
those samples themselves.

00:01:00.692 --> 00:01:04.439
They can jump right into the pen
and swab their pigs' noses and mouths

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:06.264
with a little filter paper,

00:01:06.288 --> 00:01:09.501
place that little filter paper
in a tiny tube,

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:13.406
and mix it with some chemicals
that will extract genetic material

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.343
from their pigs' noses and mouths.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.292
And without leaving their farms,

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:19.614
they take a drop of that genetic material

00:01:19.638 --> 00:01:23.429
and put it into a little analyzer
smaller than a shoebox,

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:28.473
program it to detect DNA or RNA
from the swine flu virus,

00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:32.655
and within one hour get back the results,
visualize the results.

00:01:33.247 --> 00:01:35.203
This reality is possible

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:39.148
because today we're living in the era
of personal DNA technology.

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:42.874
Every one of us can actually
test DNA ourselves.

00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:47.187
DNA is the fundamental molecule
the carries genetic instructions

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:49.251
that help build the living world.

00:01:50.052 --> 00:01:51.306
Humans have DNA.

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:53.386
Pigs have DNA.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.904
Even bacteria and some
viruses have DNA too.

00:01:56.928 --> 00:02:01.152
The genetic instructions encoded in DNA
inform how our bodies develop,

00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:02.884
grow, function.

00:02:02.908 --> 00:02:06.525
And in many cases, that same information
can trigger disease.

00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:08.686
Your genetic information

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.400
is strung into a long and twisted
molecule, the DNA double helix,

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:14.872
that has over three billion letters,

00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:16.460
beginning to end.

00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:19.704
But the lines that carry
meaningful information

00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:21.293
are usually very short --

00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:24.339
a few dozen to several
thousand letters long.

00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:27.510
So when we're looking to answer
a question based on DNA,

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:29.467
we actually don't need to read

00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:31.960
all those three billion
letters, typically.

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:34.221
That would be like getting hungry at night

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:36.635
and having to flip through
the whole phone book

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:37.914
from cover to cover,

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:39.513
pausing at every line,

00:02:39.537 --> 00:02:41.522
just to find the nearest pizza joint.

00:02:41.546 --> 00:02:42.698
(Laughter)

00:02:42.722 --> 00:02:45.259
Luckily, three decades ago,

00:02:45.283 --> 00:02:47.211
humans started to invent tools

00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:50.742
that can find any specific line
of genetic information.

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:52.955
These DNA machines are wonderful.

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.708
They can find any line in DNA.

00:02:55.732 --> 00:02:57.036
But once they find it,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.511
that DNA is still tiny, and surrounded
by so much other DNA,

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:07.177
that what these machines then do
is copy the target gene,

00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:09.442
and one copy piles on top of another,

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:11.631
millions and millions
and millions of copies,

00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:14.641
until that gene stands out
against the rest;

00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:16.848
until we can visualize it,

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:19.415
interpret it, read it, understand it,

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:20.717
until we can answer:

00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:22.848
Does my pig have the flu?

00:03:23.914 --> 00:03:27.411
Or other questions buried in our own DNA:

00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:29.347
Am I at risk of cancer?

00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:32.204
Am I of Irish descent?

00:03:32.623 --> 00:03:34.813
Is that child my son?

00:03:35.672 --> 00:03:37.846
(Laughter)

00:03:38.537 --> 00:03:43.211
This ability to make copies of DNA,
as simple as it sounds,

00:03:43.235 --> 00:03:44.526
has transformed our world.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.562
Scientists use it every day
to detect and address disease,

00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:52.074
to create innovative medicines,

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:54.134
to modify foods,

00:03:54.158 --> 00:03:56.134
to assess whether our food is safe to eat

00:03:56.158 --> 00:03:59.554
or whether it's contaminated
with deadly bacteria.

00:03:59.578 --> 00:04:02.422
Even judges use the output
of these machines in court

00:04:02.446 --> 00:04:07.020
to decide whether someone is innocent
or guilty based on DNA evidence.

00:04:07.044 --> 00:04:09.457
The inventor of this DNA-copying technique

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:13.285
was awarded the Nobel Prize
in Chemistry in 1993.

00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:14.983
But for 30 years,

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:18.840
the power of genetic analysis
has been confined to the ivory tower,

00:04:18.864 --> 00:04:21.704
or bigwig PhD scientist work.

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:24.435
Well, several companies around the world

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:28.307
are working on making
this same technology accessible

00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:31.362
to everyday people like the pig farmer,

00:04:31.386 --> 00:04:32.735
like you.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.343
I cofounded one of these companies.

00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:36.518
Three years ago,

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:39.529
together with a fellow biologist
and friend of mine,

00:04:39.553 --> 00:04:41.133
Zeke Alvarez Saavedra,

00:04:41.157 --> 00:04:43.772
we decided to make personal DNA machines

00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:45.513
that anyone could use.

00:04:45.957 --> 00:04:49.535
Our goal was to bring DNA science
to more people in new places.

00:04:49.892 --> 00:04:52.053
We started working in our basements.

00:04:52.077 --> 00:04:54.130
We had a simple question:

00:04:54.154 --> 00:04:55.905
What could the world look like

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:58.356
if everyone could analyze DNA?

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.642
We were curious,

00:05:00.142 --> 00:05:05.068
as curious as you would have been
if I had shown you this picture in 1980.

00:05:05.092 --> 00:05:06.377
(Laughter)

00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:08.192
You would have thought, "Wow!

00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:10.819
I can now call
my Aunt Glenda from the car

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:12.729
and wish her a happy birthday.

00:05:12.753 --> 00:05:14.728
I can call anyone, anytime.

00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:16.675
This is the future!"

00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:19.257
Little did you know,

00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:21.886
you would tap on that phone
to make dinner reservations

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.334
for you and Aunt Glenda
to celebrate together.

00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:26.888
With another tap,
you'd be ordering her gift.

00:05:26.912 --> 00:05:28.394
And yet one more tap,

00:05:28.418 --> 00:05:30.730
and you'd be "liking"
Auntie Glenda on Facebook.

00:05:30.754 --> 00:05:33.098
And all of this,
while sitting on the toilet.

00:05:33.122 --> 00:05:35.296
(Laughter)

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.583
It is notoriously hard to predict
where new technology might take us.

00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:45.016
And the same is true
for personal DNA technology today.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.109
For example, I could never have imagined

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:50.654
that a truffle farmer, of all people,

00:05:50.678 --> 00:05:52.767
would use personal DNA machines.

00:05:53.267 --> 00:05:56.558
Dr. Paul Thomas grows
truffles for a living.

00:05:56.582 --> 00:05:58.289
We see him pictured here,

00:05:58.313 --> 00:06:03.409
holding the first UK-cultivated truffle
in his hands, on one of his farms.

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:05.675
Truffles are this delicacy

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.762
that stems from a fungus
growing on the roots of living trees.

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.413
And it's a rare fungus.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:16.749
Some species may fetch 3,000,
7,000, or more dollars per kilogram.

00:06:17.968 --> 00:06:19.361
I learned from Paul

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:22.272
that the stakes for a truffle farmer
can be really high.

00:06:22.296 --> 00:06:25.510
When he sources new truffles
to grow on his farms,

00:06:25.534 --> 00:06:28.062
he's exposed to the threat
of knockoffs --

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:31.542
truffles that look and feel
like the real thing,

00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:33.068
but they're of lower quality.

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:35.521
But even to a trained eye like Paul's,

00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:37.627
even when looked at under a microscope,

00:06:37.651 --> 00:06:39.802
these truffles can pass for authentic.

00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:43.752
So in order to grow
the highest quality truffles,

00:06:43.776 --> 00:06:47.015
the ones that chefs
all over the world will fight over,

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.899
Paul has to use DNA analysis.

00:06:50.594 --> 00:06:52.340
Isn't that mind-blowing?

00:06:52.364 --> 00:06:55.664
I bet you will never look
at that black truffle risotto again

00:06:55.688 --> 00:06:57.358
without thinking of its genes.

00:06:57.382 --> 00:06:58.932
(Laughter)

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.815
But personal DNA machines
can also save human lives.

00:07:05.045 --> 00:07:09.565
Professor Ian Goodfellow is a virologist
at the University of Cambridge.

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:11.910
Last year he traveled to Sierra Leone.

00:07:12.267 --> 00:07:16.189
When the Ebola outbreak
broke out in Western Africa,

00:07:16.213 --> 00:07:20.025
he quickly realized that doctors there
lacked the basic tools

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:21.707
to detect and combat disease.

00:07:22.216 --> 00:07:25.250
Results could take
up to a week to come back --

00:07:25.274 --> 00:07:30.133
that's way too long for the patients
and the families who are suffering.

00:07:30.157 --> 00:07:34.651
Ian decided to move his lab
into Makeni, Sierra Leone.

00:07:35.194 --> 00:07:37.319
Here we see Ian Goodfellow

00:07:37.343 --> 00:07:41.411
moving over 10 tons of equipment
into a pop-up tent

00:07:41.435 --> 00:07:45.111
that he would equip to detect
and diagnose the virus

00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:47.861
and sequence it within 24 hours.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.029
But here's a surprise:

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:54.175
the same equipment that Ian could use
at his lab in the UK

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:56.790
to sequence and diagnose Ebola,

00:07:56.814 --> 00:07:58.947
just wouldn't work under these conditions.

00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:03.705
We're talking 35 Celsius heat
and over 90 percent humidity here.

00:08:04.153 --> 00:08:07.037
But instead, Ian could use
personal DNA machines

00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:10.411
small enough to be placed
in front of the air-conditioning unit

00:08:10.435 --> 00:08:12.366
to keep sequencing the virus

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.965
and keep saving lives.

00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:17.026
This may seem like
an extreme place for DNA analysis,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.826
but let's move on to an even
more extreme environment:

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.165
outer space.

00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:24.935
Let's talk about DNA analysis in space.

00:08:25.657 --> 00:08:28.777
When astronauts live aboard
the International Space Station,

00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:32.424
they're orbiting the planet
250 miles high.

00:08:32.448 --> 00:08:35.250
They're traveling
at 17,000 miles per hour.

00:08:35.274 --> 00:08:36.432
Picture that --

00:08:36.456 --> 00:08:40.331
you're seeing 15 sunsets
and sunrises every day.

00:08:40.817 --> 00:08:42.689
You're also living in microgravity,

00:08:42.713 --> 00:08:43.881
floating.

00:08:43.905 --> 00:08:47.067
And under these conditions,
our bodies can do funky things.

00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:51.833
One of these things is that
our immune systems get suppressed,

00:08:51.857 --> 00:08:54.452
making astronauts more prone to infection.

00:08:55.856 --> 00:08:57.769
A 16-year-old girl,

00:08:57.793 --> 00:09:01.624
a high school student from New York,
Anna-Sophia Boguraev,

00:09:01.648 --> 00:09:04.517
wondered whether changes
to the DNA of astronauts

00:09:04.541 --> 00:09:06.964
could be related
to this immune suppression,

00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:10.357
and through a science competition
called "Genes In Space,"

00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:14.288
Anna-Sophia designed an experiment
to test this hypothesis

00:09:14.312 --> 00:09:18.468
using a personal DNA machine
aboard the International Space Station.

00:09:19.463 --> 00:09:25.162
Here we see Anna-Sophia
on April 8, 2016, in Cape Canaveral,

00:09:25.186 --> 00:09:29.249
watching her experiment launch
to the International Space Station.

00:09:29.273 --> 00:09:31.804
That cloud of smoke is the rocket

00:09:31.828 --> 00:09:36.523
that brought Anna-Sophia's experiment
to the International Space Station,

00:09:36.547 --> 00:09:38.476
where, three days later,

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.248
astronaut Tim Peake
carried out her experiment --

00:09:42.272 --> 00:09:43.494
in microgravity.

00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:47.931
Personal DNA machines are now
aboard the International Space Station,

00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:50.542
where they can help monitor
living conditions

00:09:50.566 --> 00:09:52.660
and protect the lives of astronauts.

00:09:53.938 --> 00:09:57.779
A 16-year-old designing a DNA experiment

00:09:57.803 --> 00:09:59.716
to protect the lives of astronauts

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.302
may seem like a rarity,
the mark of a child genius.

00:10:03.784 --> 00:10:06.354
Well, to me, it signals
something bigger:

00:10:06.378 --> 00:10:11.531
that DNA technology is finally
within the reach of every one of you.

00:10:12.999 --> 00:10:14.706
A few years ago,

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.913
a college student armed
with a personal computer

00:10:17.937 --> 00:10:19.088
could code an app,

00:10:19.112 --> 00:10:23.488
an app that is now a social network
with more than one billion users.

00:10:23.933 --> 00:10:25.893
Could we be moving into a world

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:29.188
of one personal DNA machine in every home?

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:33.347
I know families who are already
living in this reality.

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:35.665
The Daniels family, for example,

00:10:35.689 --> 00:10:40.535
set up a DNA lab in the basement
of their suburban Chicago home.

00:10:40.904 --> 00:10:44.107
This is not a family
made of PhD scientists.

00:10:44.656 --> 00:10:46.766
This is a family like any other.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.845
They just like to spend time together
doing fun, creative things.

00:10:50.869 --> 00:10:54.732
By day, Brian is an executive
at a private equity firm.

00:10:55.137 --> 00:10:58.042
At night and on weekends,
he experiments with DNA

00:10:58.066 --> 00:11:00.963
alongside his kids, ages seven and nine,

00:11:00.987 --> 00:11:03.091
as a way to explore the living world.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.154
Last time I called them,

00:11:05.178 --> 00:11:09.066
they were checking out homegrown produce
from the backyard garden.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.387
They were testing tomatoes
that they had picked,

00:11:11.411 --> 00:11:14.191
taking the flesh of their skin,
putting it in a test tube,

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:16.297
mixing it with chemicals to extract DNA

00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:19.799
and then using their home DNA copier

00:11:19.823 --> 00:11:23.746
to test those tomatoes
for genetically engineered traits.

00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:26.410
For the Daniels family,

00:11:26.434 --> 00:11:29.333
the personal DNA machine
is like the chemistry set

00:11:29.357 --> 00:11:30.684
for the 21st century.

00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:35.237
Most of us may not yet
be diagnosing genetic conditions

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:36.607
in our kitchen sinks

00:11:37.123 --> 00:11:39.341
or doing at-home paternity testing.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.390
(Laughter)

00:11:40.414 --> 00:11:42.634
But we've definitely reached
a point in history

00:11:42.658 --> 00:11:48.467
where every one of you could actually
get hands-on with DNA

00:11:48.491 --> 00:11:49.922
in your kitchen.

00:11:49.946 --> 00:11:53.133
You could copy, paste and analyze DNA

00:11:53.157 --> 00:11:55.688
and extract meaningful
information from it.

00:11:56.394 --> 00:11:59.251
And it's at times like this
that profound transformation

00:11:59.275 --> 00:12:00.874
is bound to happen;

00:12:00.898 --> 00:12:04.150
moments when a transformative,
powerful technology

00:12:04.174 --> 00:12:07.796
that was before limited
to a select few in the ivory tower,

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.293
finally becomes within the reach
of every one of us,

00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:14.142
from farmers to schoolchildren.

00:12:14.772 --> 00:12:15.939
Think about the moment

00:12:15.963 --> 00:12:19.840
when phones stopped being
plugged into the wall by cords,

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.159
or when computers left the mainframe

00:12:22.183 --> 00:12:24.796
and entered your home or your office.

00:12:25.574 --> 00:12:28.397
The ripples of the personal DNA revolution

00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:29.948
may be hard to predict,

00:12:29.972 --> 00:12:31.589
but one thing is certain:

00:12:31.613 --> 00:12:34.005
revolutions don't go backwards,

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:38.294
and DNA technology is already spreading
faster than our imagination.

00:12:38.318 --> 00:12:40.217
So if you're curious,

00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:43.456
get up close and personal
with DNA -- today.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.071
It is in our DNA to be curious.

00:12:46.095 --> 00:12:47.110
(Laughter)

00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:48.294
Thank you.

00:12:48.318 --> 00:12:51.632
(Applause)
