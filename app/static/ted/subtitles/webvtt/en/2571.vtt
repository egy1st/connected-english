00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.536
As a lover of human anatomy,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.576
I'm so excited that we're finally
putting our bodies at the center of focus.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.176
Through practices
such as preventive medicine,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.656
patient empowerment

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.256
and self-monitoring --

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.816
down to now obsessing
over every single step we take in a day.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.456
All of this works to promote

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.240
a healthy connection
between ourselves and our bodies.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.016
Despite all this focus
on the healthy self,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.880
general public knowledge
of the anatomical self is lacking.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.515
Many people don't know
the location of their vital organs,

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.296
or even how they function.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.776
And that's because human anatomy

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.000
is a difficult and time-intensive
subject to learn.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.840
How many of you here
made it through anatomy?

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.096
Wow, good --

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.480
most of you are in medicine.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.240
I, like you, spent countless hours
memorizing hundreds of structures.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.440
Something no student of anatomy
could do without the help of visuals.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.936
Because at the end of the day,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.616
whether you remember
every little structure or not,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.216
these medical illustrations are what
makes studying anatomy so intriguing.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.696
In looking at them,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.960
we're actually viewing
a manual of our very selves.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.280
But what happens when we're done studying?

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.976
These beautiful illustrations
are then shut back

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.976
into the pages of a medical textbook,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.216
or an app,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.600
referenced only when needed.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.656
And for the public,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.536
medical illustrations
may only be encountered passively

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.200
on the walls of a doctor's office.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.416
From the beginnings of modern medicine,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.736
medical illustration,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.336
and therefore anatomy,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.240
have existed primarily within
the realm of medical education.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.496
Yet there's something fascinating
happening right now.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.016
Artists are breaking anatomy
out of the confines of the medical world

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.240
and are thrusting it
into the public space.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.776
For the past nine years,
I have been cataloguing and sharing

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.296
this rise in anatomical art
with the public --

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.120
all from my perspective
as a medical illustrator.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.816
But before I get into showing you
how artists are reclaiming anatomy today,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.200
it's important to understand
how art influenced anatomy in the past.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.976
Now, anatomy is by its
very nature a visual science,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.680
and the first anatomists to understand
this lived during the Renaissance.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.336
They relied on artists

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.840
to help advertise their discoveries
to their peers in the public.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.200
And this drive to not only teach
but also to entertain

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.480
resulted in some of the strangest
anatomical illustrations.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.136
Anatomy was caught in a struggle
between science, art and culture

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.960
that lasted for over 500 years.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.856
Artists rendered
dissected cadavers as alive,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.560
posed in these humorous
anatomical stripteases.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.400
Imagine seeing that
in your textbooks today.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.720
They also showed them as very much dead --

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.680
unwillingly stripped of their skin.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.560
Disembodied limbs were often
posed in literal still lives.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.656
And some illustrations
even included pop culture references.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.976
This is Clara,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.336
a famous rhinoceros that was
traveling Europe in the mid-1700s,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.376
at a time when seeing a rhino
was an exciting rarity.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.080
Including her in this illustration
was akin to celebrity sponsorship today.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.160
The introduction of color

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.136
then brought a whole new
depth and clarity to anatomy

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.520
that made it stunning.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.776
By the early 20th century,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.256
the perfect balance of science
and art had finally been struck

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.096
with the emergence
of medical illustrators.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.976
They created a universal
representation of anatomy --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.856
something that was neither alive nor dead,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.240
that was free from those influences
of artistic culture.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.896
And this focus on no-frills accuracy

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.536
was precisely for the benefit
of medical education.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.160
And this is what we
get to study from today.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.896
But why is it that medical illustration --

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.495
both past and present --

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.079
captures our imaginations?

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.040
Now, we are innately tuned
into the beauty of the human body.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.960
And medical illustration is still art.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.856
Nothing can elicit
an emotional response --

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.456
from joy to complete disgust --

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.720
more than the human body.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.616
And today,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.016
artists armed with that emotion,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.736
are grasping anatomy
from the medical world,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.880
and are reinvigorating it through art
in the most imaginative ways.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.016
A perfect example of this is Spanish
contemporary artist Fernando Vicente.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.200
He takes 19th century anatomical
illustrations of the male body

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.840
and envelops them in a female sensuality.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.456
The women in his paintings taunt us
to view beyond their surface anatomy,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.416
thereby introducing a strong femininity

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.320
that was previously lacking in the history
of anatomical representation.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.216
Artistry can also be seen in the repair
and recovery of the human body.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.376
This is an X-ray of a woman
who fractured and dislocated her ankle

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.800
in a roller-skating accident.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.696
As a tribute to her trauma,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.416
she commissioned Montreal-based
architect Federico Carbajal

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.240
to construct a wire sculpture
of her damaged lower leg.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.560
Now, notice those bright red screws
magnified in the sculpture.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.920
These are the actual surgical screws
used in reconstructing her ankle.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.000
It's medical hardware
that's been repurposed as art.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.456
People often ask me how I choose
the art that I showcase online

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.416
or feature in gallery shows.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.096
And for me it's a balance
between the technique

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.856
and a concept that pushes the boundaries
of anatomy as a way to know thyself,

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.200
which is why the work
of Michael Reedy struck me.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.576
His serious figure drawings
are often layered in elements of humor.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.680
For instance, take a look at her face.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.240
Notice those red marks.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.496
Michael manifests the consuming
insecurity of a skin condition

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.496
as these maniacal cartoon monsters

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.680
annoying and out of control
in the background.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.880
On the mirrored figure,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.776
he renders the full anatomy

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.936
and covers it in glitter,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.320
making it look like candy.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.856
By doing this,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.256
Michael downplays
the common perception of anatomy

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.760
so closely tied to just disease and death.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.616
Now, this next concept
might not make much sense,

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.560
but human anatomy
is no longer limited to humans.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.656
When you were a child,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.136
did you ever wish
that your toys could come to life?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.376
Well, Jason Freeny
makes those dreams come true

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.016
with his magical toy dissections.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.360
(Laughter)

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.056
One might think that this
would bring a morbid edge

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.536
to one's innocent childhood characters,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.056
but Jason says of his dissections,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.560
"One thing I've never seen
in a child's reaction to my work is fear."

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.176
It's always wonder,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.576
amazement

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.920
and wanting to explore.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.200
Fear of anatomy and guts
is a learned reaction.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.440
This anatomization also extends to
politically and socially charged objects.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.456
In Noah Scalin's "Anatomy of War,"

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.040
we see a gun dissected
to reveal human organs.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.896
But if you look closely,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.680
you'll notice that it lacks a brain.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.136
And if you keep looking,
you might also notice

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.256
that Noah has so thoughtfully
placed the rectum

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.160
at the business end of that gun barrel.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.856
Now, this next artist
I've been following for many years,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.200
watching him excite
the public about anatomy.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.216
Danny Quirk is a young artist

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.520
who paints his subjects
in the process of self-dissection.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.616
He bends the rules of medical illustration

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.040
by inserting a very dramatic
light and shadow.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.176
And this creates a 3-D illusion

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.320
that lends itself very well
to painting directly on the human skin.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.360
Danny makes it look as if a person's
skin has actually been removed.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.775
And this effect --

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.000
also cool and tattoo-like --

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.799
easily transitions
into a medical illustration.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.296
Now Danny is currently
traveling the world,

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.336
teaching anatomy to the public
via his body paintings,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.416
which is why it was
so shocking to find out

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.160
that he was rejected
from medical illustration programs.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.920
But he's doing just fine.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.736
Then there are artists

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.536
who are extracting anatomy from both
the medical world and the art world

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.640
and are placing it
directly on the streets.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.320
London-based SHOK-1 paints
giant X-rays of pop culture icons.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.456
His X-rays show how culture
can come to have an anatomy of its own,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.320
and conversely how culture can become
part of the anatomy of a person.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.336
You come to admire his work

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.416
because reproducing X-rays by hand,
let alone with spray paint,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.496
is extremely difficult.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.416
But then again this is a street artist,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.920
who also happens to hold
a degree in applied chemistry.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.616
Nychos, an Austrian street artist,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.736
takes the term "exploded view"
to a whole new level,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.440
splattering human and animal dissections
on walls all over the world.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.296
Influenced by comics and heavy metal,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.136
Nychos inserts a very youthful
and enticing energy into anatomy

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.400
that I just love.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.776
Street artists believe
that art belongs to the public.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.656
And this street anatomy is so captivating

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.400
because it is the furthest removed
from the medical world.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.536
It forces you to look at it,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.800
and confront your own
perceptions about anatomy,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.656
whether you find it beautiful,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.896
gross,

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.136
morbid

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
or awe-inspiring, like I do.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.856
That it elicits these responses at all

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.440
is due to our intimate
and often changing relationship with it.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.336
All of the artists
that I showed you here today

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.016
referenced medical
illustrations for their art.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.256
But for them,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.976
anatomy isn't just something to memorize,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.160
but a base from which to understand
the human body on a meaningful level;

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.456
to depict it in ways that we can relate,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.816
whether it be through cartoons,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.056
body painting

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.280
or street art.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.056
Anatomical art has the power

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.096
to reach far beyond
the pages of a medical textbook,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.296
to ignite an excitement in the public,

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.760
and reinvigorate an enthusiasm
in the medical world,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.680
ultimately connecting our innermost selves
with our bodies through art.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.096
Thank you.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.200
(Applause)
