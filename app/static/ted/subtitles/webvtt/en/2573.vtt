WEBVTT

00:00:00.831 --> 00:00:04.277
The technology likely to have
the greatest impact

00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:06.047
on the next few decades

00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:07.323
has arrived.

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:10.241
And it's not social media.

00:00:10.265 --> 00:00:11.662
It's not big data.

00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:13.193
It's not robotics.

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:14.700
It's not even AI.

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:17.399
You'll be surprised to learn

00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:22.135
that it's the underlying technology
of digital currencies like Bitcoin.

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.560
It's called the blockchain. Blockchain.

00:00:26.337 --> 00:00:29.173
Now, it's not the most sonorous
word in the world,

00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:32.710
but I believe that this is now

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:35.275
the next generation of the internet,

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:39.874
and that it holds vast promise
for every business, every society

00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:41.565
and for all of you, individually.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:47.042
You know, for the past few decades,
we've had the internet of information.

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:51.287
And when I send you an email
or a PowerPoint file or something,

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:53.385
I'm actually not sending you the original,

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.772
I'm sending you a copy.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.739
And that's great.

00:00:56.763 --> 00:00:59.219
This is democratized information.

00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:03.199
But when it comes to assets --

00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:05.568
things like money,

00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:08.047
financial assets like stocks and bonds,

00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:11.506
loyalty points, intellectual property,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.059
music, art, a vote,

00:01:14.982 --> 00:01:17.587
carbon credit and other assets --

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:20.223
sending you a copy is a really bad idea.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.042
If I send you 100 dollars,

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:25.103
it's really important
that I don't still have the money --

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:26.134
(Laughter)

00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:28.516
and that I can't send it to you.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.877
This has been called
the "double-spend" problem

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:32.995
by cryptographers for a long time.

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.738
So today, we rely entirely
on big intermediaries --

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:41.015
middlemen like banks, government,

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.603
big social media companies,
credit card companies and so on --

00:01:44.627 --> 00:01:47.269
to establish trust in our economy.

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:52.873
And these intermediaries perform
all the business and transaction logic

00:01:52.897 --> 00:01:54.293
of every kind of commerce,

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:56.978
from authentication,
identification of people,

00:01:57.002 --> 00:02:01.067
through to clearing, settling
and record keeping.

00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:03.504
And overall, they do a pretty good job.

00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:05.225
But there are growing problems.

00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:07.474
To begin, they're centralized.

00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:10.466
That means they can be hacked,
and increasingly are --

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.049
JP Morgan, the US Federal Government,

00:02:13.073 --> 00:02:14.864
LinkedIn, Home Depot and others

00:02:14.888 --> 00:02:16.303
found that out the hard way.

00:02:16.874 --> 00:02:20.388
They exclude billions of people
from the global economy,

00:02:20.412 --> 00:02:22.665
for example, people
who don't have enough money

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:23.949
to have a bank account.

00:02:24.624 --> 00:02:26.912
They slow things down.

00:02:26.936 --> 00:02:30.506
It can take a second for an email
to go around the world,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.954
but it can take days or weeks

00:02:32.978 --> 00:02:36.110
for money to move through
the banking system across a city.

00:02:36.134 --> 00:02:38.333
And they take a big piece of the action --

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:41.387
10 to 20 percent just to send money
to another country.

00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:43.663
They capture our data,

00:02:43.687 --> 00:02:45.639
and that means we can't monetize it

00:02:45.663 --> 00:02:48.417
or use it to better manage our lives.

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:51.178
Our privacy is being undermined.

00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:53.426
And the biggest problem is that overall,

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:59.886
they've appropriated the largesse
of the digital age asymmetrically:

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.144
we have wealth creation,
but we have growing social inequality.

00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:09.447
So what if there were not only
an internet of information,

00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:11.938
what if there were an internet of value --

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:16.645
some kind of vast, global,
distributed ledger

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.807
running on millions of computers

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.915
and available to everybody.

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.790
And where every kind of asset,
from money to music,

00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:30.518
could be stored, moved, transacted,
exchanged and managed,

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:33.078
all without powerful intermediaries?

00:03:33.507 --> 00:03:37.184
What if there were
a native medium for value?

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:42.914
Well, in 2008, the financial
industry crashed

00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:45.522
and, perhaps propitiously,

00:03:45.546 --> 00:03:50.480
an anonymous person or persons
named Satoshi Nakamoto

00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:58.311
created a paper where he developed
a protocol for a digital cash

00:03:58.335 --> 00:04:01.628
that used an underlying
cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.

00:04:02.421 --> 00:04:08.239
And this cryptocurrency enabled people
to establish trust and do transactions

00:04:08.263 --> 00:04:09.954
without a third party.

00:04:09.978 --> 00:04:13.714
And this seemingly simple act
set off a spark

00:04:13.738 --> 00:04:15.885
that ignited the world,

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:21.052
that has everyone excited
or terrified or otherwise interested

00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:22.321
in many places.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.710
Now, don't be confused about Bitcoin --

00:04:24.734 --> 00:04:27.909
Bitcoin is an asset; it goes up and down,

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:30.945
and that should be of interest
to you if you're a speculator.

00:04:31.525 --> 00:04:33.930
More broadly, it's a cryptocurrency.

00:04:33.954 --> 00:04:37.303
It's not a fiat currency
controlled by a nation-state.

00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:38.974
And that's of greater interest.

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:42.626
But the real pony here
is the underlying technology.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.481
It's called blockchain.

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:49.092
So for the first time now
in human history,

00:04:49.116 --> 00:04:51.594
people everywhere can trust each other

00:04:51.618 --> 00:04:54.219
and transact peer to peer.

00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:59.241
And trust is established,
not by some big institution,

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:02.321
but by collaboration, by cryptography

00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:04.478
and by some clever code.

00:05:04.502 --> 00:05:07.500
And because trust is native
to the technology,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.587
I call this, "The Trust Protocol."

00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:13.650
Now, you're probably wondering:
How does this thing work?

00:05:13.674 --> 00:05:14.894
Fair enough.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.445
Assets -- digital assets like money
to music and everything in between --

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.135
are not stored in a central place,

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.855
but they're distributed
across a global ledger,

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.397
using the highest level of cryptography.

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:31.588
And when a transaction is conducted,

00:05:31.612 --> 00:05:33.690
it's posted globally,

00:05:33.714 --> 00:05:36.783
across millions and millions of computers.

00:05:37.508 --> 00:05:39.352
And out there, around the world,

00:05:39.376 --> 00:05:41.670
is a group of people called "miners."

00:05:41.694 --> 00:05:45.186
These are not young people,
they're Bitcoin miners.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.217
They have massive computing power
at their fingertips --

00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:53.051
10 to 100 times bigger
than all of Google worldwide.

00:05:53.598 --> 00:05:55.534
These miners do a lot of work.

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.495
And every 10 minutes,

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:59.806
kind of like the heartbeat of a network,

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.035
a block gets created

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:05.285
that has all the transactions
from the previous 10 minutes.

00:06:05.714 --> 00:06:10.849
Then the miners get to work,
trying to solve some tough problems.

00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:12.195
And they compete:

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.530
the first miner to find out the truth
and to validate the block,

00:06:16.554 --> 00:06:18.915
is rewarded in digital currency,

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:21.702
in the case of the Bitcoin
blockchain, with Bitcoin.

00:06:22.171 --> 00:06:24.331
And then -- this is the key part --

00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:26.812
that block is linked to the previous block

00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:28.145
and the previous block

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.417
to create a chain of blocks.

00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:32.880
And every one is time-stamped,

00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:35.102
kind of like with a digital waxed seal.

00:06:35.434 --> 00:06:37.781
So if I wanted to go and hack a block

00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:41.640
and, say, pay you and you
with the same money,

00:06:42.394 --> 00:06:43.917
I'd have to hack that block,

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:45.371
plus all the preceding blocks,

00:06:45.395 --> 00:06:48.789
the entire history of commerce
on that blockchain,

00:06:48.813 --> 00:06:52.304
not just on one computer
but across millions of computers,

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.107
simultaneously,

00:06:54.131 --> 00:06:57.466
all using the highest
levels of encryption,

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.580
in the light of the most powerful
computing resource in the world

00:07:00.604 --> 00:07:01.852
that's watching me.

00:07:01.876 --> 00:07:03.041
Tough to do.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.712
This is infinitely more secure

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:08.095
than the computer systems
that we have today.

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:10.703
Blockchain. That's how it works.

00:07:11.402 --> 00:07:13.583
So the Bitcoin blockchain is just one.

00:07:13.607 --> 00:07:14.758
There are many.

00:07:14.782 --> 00:07:19.676
The Ethereum blockchain was developed
by a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.930
He's [22] years old,

00:07:21.954 --> 00:07:26.172
and this blockchain
has some extraordinary capabilities.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:29.279
One of them is that you can
build smart contracts.

00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:31.271
It's kind of what it sounds like.

00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:33.858
It's a contract that self-executes,

00:07:33.882 --> 00:07:38.749
and the contract handles the enforcement,
the management, performance

00:07:38.773 --> 00:07:43.034
and payment -- the contract kind of has
a bank account, too, in a sense --

00:07:43.058 --> 00:07:45.694
of agreements between people.

00:07:45.718 --> 00:07:48.432
And today, on the Ethereum blockchain,

00:07:48.456 --> 00:07:50.743
there are projects underway
to do everything

00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:53.929
from create a new replacement
for the stock market

00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:55.776
to create a new model of democracy,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.903
where politicians
are accountable to citizens.

00:07:58.927 --> 00:08:02.387
(Applause)

00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:06.490
So to understand what a radical change
this is going to bring,

00:08:06.514 --> 00:08:08.807
let's look at one industry,
financial services.

00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:10.602
Recognize this?

00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:12.976
Rube Goldberg machine.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.681
It's a ridiculously complicated machine
that does something really simple,

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:19.083
like crack an egg or shut a door.

00:08:19.593 --> 00:08:23.425
Well, it kind of reminds me
of the financial services industry,

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:24.615
honestly.

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:27.544
I mean, you tap your card
in the corner store,

00:08:27.568 --> 00:08:30.819
and a bitstream goes through
a dozen companies,

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.206
each with their own computer system,

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.535
some of them being 1970s mainframes

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.351
older than many
of the people in this room,

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:41.154
and three days later, a settlement occurs.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.264
Well, with a blockchain
financial industry,

00:08:45.288 --> 00:08:46.691
there would be no settlement,

00:08:46.715 --> 00:08:49.573
because the payment and the settlement
is the same activity,

00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:51.341
it's just a change in the ledger.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.300
So Wall Street and all around the world,

00:08:54.324 --> 00:08:57.587
the financial industry
is in a big upheaval about this,

00:08:57.611 --> 00:08:59.762
wondering, can we be replaced,

00:08:59.786 --> 00:09:02.749
or how do we embrace
this technology for success?

00:09:03.349 --> 00:09:04.971
Now, why should you care?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.788
Well, let me describe some applications.

00:09:09.748 --> 00:09:11.416
Prosperity.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.448
The first era of the internet,

00:09:13.472 --> 00:09:14.813
the internet of information,

00:09:14.837 --> 00:09:18.300
brought us wealth
but not shared prosperity,

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:20.778
because social inequality is growing.

00:09:20.802 --> 00:09:24.785
And this is at the heart
of all of the anger and extremism

00:09:24.809 --> 00:09:28.409
and protectionism and xenophobia and worse

00:09:28.433 --> 00:09:31.015
that we're seeing growing
in the world today,

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:33.888
Brexit being the most recent case.

00:09:34.868 --> 00:09:40.611
So could we develop some new approaches
to this problem of inequality?

00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:44.384
Because the only approach today
is to redistribute wealth,

00:09:44.408 --> 00:09:46.588
tax people and spread it around more.

00:09:46.612 --> 00:09:49.048
Could we pre-distribute wealth?

00:09:49.686 --> 00:09:52.882
Could we change the way that wealth
gets created in the first place

00:09:52.906 --> 00:09:55.076
by democratizing wealth creation,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.493
engaging more people in the economy,

00:09:57.517 --> 00:10:00.613
and then ensuring that they got
fair compensation?

00:10:01.158 --> 00:10:04.002
Let me describe five ways
that this can be done.

00:10:04.597 --> 00:10:06.023
Number one:

00:10:06.047 --> 00:10:11.276
Did you know that 70 percent
of the people in the world who have land

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.419
have a tenuous title to it?

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.255
So, you've got a little farm in Honduras,
some dictator comes to power,

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:20.871
he says, "I know you've got a piece
of paper that says you own your farm,

00:10:20.895 --> 00:10:24.550
but the government computer
says my friend owns your farm."

00:10:24.967 --> 00:10:27.145
This happened on a mass scale in Honduras,

00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:29.516
and this problem exists everywhere.

00:10:30.214 --> 00:10:32.989
Hernando de Soto, the great
Latin American economist,

00:10:33.013 --> 00:10:35.157
says this is the number one
issue in the world

00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:36.775
in terms of economic mobility,

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:38.940
more important than having a bank account,

00:10:38.964 --> 00:10:41.597
because if you don't have
a valid title to your land,

00:10:41.621 --> 00:10:43.177
you can't borrow against it,

00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:45.223
and you can't plan for the future.

00:10:45.969 --> 00:10:49.309
So today, companies
are working with governments

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:51.776
to put land titles on a blockchain.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.100
And once it's there, this is immutable.

00:10:54.718 --> 00:10:55.964
You can't hack it.

00:10:56.313 --> 00:10:59.468
This creates the conditions for prosperity

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.660
for potentially billions of people.

00:11:02.505 --> 00:11:03.668
Secondly:

00:11:04.295 --> 00:11:06.529
a lot of writers talk about Uber

00:11:06.553 --> 00:11:09.888
and Airbnb and TaskRabbit
and Lyft and so on

00:11:09.912 --> 00:11:12.208
as part of the sharing economy.

00:11:12.232 --> 00:11:13.896
This is a very powerful idea,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.099
that peers can come together
and create and share wealth.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.123
My view is that ...

00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:23.724
these companies are not really sharing.

00:11:23.748 --> 00:11:27.855
In fact, they're successful
precisely because they don't share.

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:31.051
They aggregate services together,
and they sell them.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:36.642
What if, rather than Airbnb
being a $25 billion corporation,

00:11:36.666 --> 00:11:42.172
there was a distributed application
on a blockchain, we'll call it B-Airbnb,

00:11:42.196 --> 00:11:46.230
and it was essentially owned
by all of the people

00:11:46.254 --> 00:11:47.986
who have a room to rent.

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:51.145
And when someone wants to rent a room,

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:55.311
they go onto the blockchain
database and all the criteria,

00:11:55.335 --> 00:11:57.842
they sift through, it helps
them find the right room,

00:11:57.866 --> 00:12:00.635
and then the blockchain helps
with the contracting,

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:02.531
it identifies the party,

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:03.913
it handles the payments

00:12:03.937 --> 00:12:07.183
just through digital payments --
they're built into the system.

00:12:07.207 --> 00:12:08.738
And it even handles reputation,

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:12.954
because if she rates a room
as a five-star room,

00:12:12.978 --> 00:12:14.194
that room is there,

00:12:14.218 --> 00:12:16.445
and it's rated, and it's immutable.

00:12:17.043 --> 00:12:21.787
So, the big sharing-economy
disruptors in Silicon Valley

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:23.699
could be disrupted,

00:12:24.096 --> 00:12:26.337
and this would be good for prosperity.

00:12:26.361 --> 00:12:27.518
Number three:

00:12:28.403 --> 00:12:30.974
the biggest flow of funds
from the developed world

00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:32.284
to the developing world

00:12:32.308 --> 00:12:34.570
is not corporate investment,

00:12:34.594 --> 00:12:36.875
and it's not even foreign aid.

00:12:37.605 --> 00:12:39.605
It's remittances.

00:12:40.329 --> 00:12:42.264
This is the global diaspora;

00:12:42.288 --> 00:12:44.645
people have left their ancestral lands,

00:12:44.669 --> 00:12:48.558
and they're sending money back
to their families at home.

00:12:48.582 --> 00:12:51.705
This is 600 billion dollars a year,
and it's growing,

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:53.769
and these people are getting ripped off.

00:12:54.555 --> 00:12:57.169
Analie Domingo is a housekeeper.

00:12:57.864 --> 00:12:59.769
She lives in Toronto,

00:12:59.793 --> 00:13:04.557
and every month she goes
to the Western Union office

00:13:04.581 --> 00:13:06.120
with some cash

00:13:06.144 --> 00:13:09.104
to send her remittances
to her mom in Manila.

00:13:09.835 --> 00:13:11.728
It costs her around 10 percent;

00:13:11.752 --> 00:13:13.992
the money takes four to seven
days to get there;

00:13:14.016 --> 00:13:16.180
her mom never knows
when it's going to arrive.

00:13:16.204 --> 00:13:18.738
It takes five hours
out of her week to do this.

00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:20.723
Six months ago,

00:13:20.747 --> 00:13:25.327
Analie Domingo used
a blockchain application called Abra.

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:28.384
And from her mobile device,
she sent 300 bucks.

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:30.888
It went directly
to her mom's mobile device

00:13:30.912 --> 00:13:32.796
without going through an intermediary.

00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:35.738
And then her mom
looked at her mobile device --

00:13:35.762 --> 00:13:39.551
it's kind of like an Uber interface,
there's Abra "tellers" moving around.

00:13:39.575 --> 00:13:42.313
She clicks on a teller
that's a five-star teller,

00:13:42.337 --> 00:13:43.722
who's seven minutes away.

00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:47.346
The guy shows up at the door,
gives her Filipino pesos,

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.936
she puts them in her wallet.

00:13:49.365 --> 00:13:51.121
The whole thing took minutes,

00:13:51.145 --> 00:13:53.008
and it cost her two percent.

00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:57.120
This is a big opportunity for prosperity.

00:13:57.637 --> 00:14:01.856
Number four: the most powerful asset
of the digital age is data.

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:05.942
And data is really a new asset class,

00:14:05.966 --> 00:14:08.245
maybe bigger than previous asset classes,

00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:11.230
like land under the agrarian economy,

00:14:11.254 --> 00:14:12.907
or an industrial plant,

00:14:12.931 --> 00:14:14.088
or even money.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.550
And all of you -- we -- create this data.

00:14:17.574 --> 00:14:19.356
We create this asset,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.095
and we leave this trail
of digital crumbs behind us

00:14:22.119 --> 00:14:23.949
as we go throughout life.

00:14:23.973 --> 00:14:26.793
And these crumbs are collected
into a mirror image of you,

00:14:26.817 --> 00:14:28.041
the virtual you.

00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:31.152
And the virtual you may know
more about you than you do,

00:14:31.176 --> 00:14:33.807
because you can't remember
what you bought a year ago,

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:36.470
or said a year ago,
or your exact location a year ago.

00:14:36.494 --> 00:14:39.271
And the virtual you is not owned by you --

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.762
that's the big problem.

00:14:41.419 --> 00:14:43.997
So today, there are companies working

00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:47.658
to create an identity in a black box,

00:14:47.682 --> 00:14:49.293
the virtual you owned by you.

00:14:49.853 --> 00:14:53.158
And this black box moves around with you

00:14:53.182 --> 00:14:55.172
as you travel throughout the world,

00:14:55.196 --> 00:14:57.266
and it's very, very stingy.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.345
It only gives away
the shred of information

00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:01.916
that's required to do something.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.229
A lot of transactions,

00:15:03.253 --> 00:15:05.726
the seller doesn't even need
to know who you are.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.218
They just need to know that they got paid.

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:12.690
And then this avatar
is sweeping up all of this data

00:15:12.714 --> 00:15:15.458
and enabling you to monetize it.

00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:17.849
And this is a wonderful thing,

00:15:17.873 --> 00:15:21.064
because it can also help us
protect our privacy,

00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:24.900
and privacy is the foundation
of a free society.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.890
Let's get this asset that we create

00:15:26.914 --> 00:15:28.691
back under our control,

00:15:28.715 --> 00:15:30.723
where we can own our own identity

00:15:30.747 --> 00:15:32.518
and manage it responsibly.

00:15:33.817 --> 00:15:34.974
Finally --

00:15:34.998 --> 00:15:39.796
(Applause)

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:41.831
Finally, number five:

00:15:41.855 --> 00:15:45.117
there are a whole number
of creators of content

00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:47.348
who don't receive fair compensation,

00:15:47.372 --> 00:15:50.464
because the system
for intellectual property is broken.

00:15:50.488 --> 00:15:53.600
It was broken by the first era
of the internet.

00:15:53.624 --> 00:15:55.091
Take music.

00:15:55.734 --> 00:15:58.864
Musicians are left with crumbs
at the end of the whole food chain.

00:15:58.888 --> 00:16:03.728
You know, if you were a songwriter,
25 years ago, you wrote a hit song,

00:16:03.752 --> 00:16:06.014
it got a million singles,

00:16:06.038 --> 00:16:09.559
you could get royalties
of around 45,000 dollars.

00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:11.899
Today, you're a songwriter,
you write a hit song,

00:16:11.923 --> 00:16:13.376
it gets a million streams,

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.170
you don't get 45k,

00:16:15.194 --> 00:16:17.781
you get 36 dollars,

00:16:17.805 --> 00:16:19.752
enough to buy a nice pizza.

00:16:20.721 --> 00:16:22.099
So Imogen Heap,

00:16:22.123 --> 00:16:24.507
the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter,

00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:28.502
is now putting music
on a blockchain ecosystem.

00:16:28.526 --> 00:16:30.375
She calls it "Mycelia."

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:34.505
And the music has
a smart contract surrounding it.

00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:38.052
And the music protects
her intellectual property rights.

00:16:38.076 --> 00:16:39.589
You want to listen to the song?

00:16:39.613 --> 00:16:42.970
It's free, or maybe a few micro-cents
that flow into a digital account.

00:16:42.994 --> 00:16:45.692
You want to put the song
in your movie, that's different,

00:16:45.716 --> 00:16:47.475
and the IP rights are all specified.

00:16:47.499 --> 00:16:49.762
You want to make a ringtone?
That's different.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.439
She describes that the song
becomes a business.

00:16:53.463 --> 00:16:56.272
It's out there on this platform
marketing itself,

00:16:56.296 --> 00:16:58.263
protecting the rights of the author,

00:16:58.287 --> 00:17:00.442
and because the song has a payment system

00:17:00.466 --> 00:17:01.928
in the sense of bank account,

00:17:01.952 --> 00:17:04.300
all the money flows back to the artist,

00:17:04.324 --> 00:17:06.559
and they control the industry,

00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:08.995
rather than these powerful intermediaries.

00:17:09.757 --> 00:17:10.908
Now, this is --

00:17:10.932 --> 00:17:15.124
(Applause)

00:17:15.604 --> 00:17:17.301
This is not just songwriters,

00:17:17.325 --> 00:17:18.824
it's any creator of content,

00:17:18.848 --> 00:17:20.315
like art,

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.807
like inventions,

00:17:22.831 --> 00:17:25.792
scientific discoveries, journalists.

00:17:25.816 --> 00:17:28.829
There are all kinds of people
who don't get fair compensation,

00:17:28.853 --> 00:17:30.323
and with blockchains,

00:17:30.347 --> 00:17:34.109
they're going to be able
to make it rain on the blockchain.

00:17:34.133 --> 00:17:35.791
And that's a wonderful thing.

00:17:36.775 --> 00:17:41.368
So, these are five opportunities

00:17:41.392 --> 00:17:42.666
out of a dozen

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.991
to solve one problem, prosperity,

00:17:45.015 --> 00:17:48.063
which is one of countless problems

00:17:48.087 --> 00:17:50.118
that blockchains are applicable to.

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:54.991
Now, technology doesn't create
prosperity, of course -- people do.

00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:59.382
But my case to you is that, once again,

00:17:59.905 --> 00:18:03.342
the technology genie
has escaped from the bottle,

00:18:03.366 --> 00:18:06.578
and it was summoned
by an unknown person or persons

00:18:06.602 --> 00:18:09.327
at this uncertain time in human history,

00:18:10.216 --> 00:18:13.487
and it's giving us
another kick at the can,

00:18:13.511 --> 00:18:18.628
another opportunity to rewrite
the economic power grid

00:18:18.652 --> 00:18:20.376
and the old order of things,

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.796
and solve some of the world's most
difficult problems,

00:18:25.272 --> 00:18:26.661
if we will it.

00:18:27.915 --> 00:18:29.107
Thank you.

00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:34.554
(Applause)
