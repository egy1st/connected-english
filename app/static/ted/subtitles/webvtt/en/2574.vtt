00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:02.236
There are things we say

00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:04.657
when we catch the eye of a stranger

00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:06.403
or a neighbor walking by.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.056
We say, "Hello, how are you?

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.788
It's a beautiful day.

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.001
How do you feel?"

00:00:13.552 --> 00:00:17.186
These sound kind of meaningless, right?
And, in some ways, they are.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.569
They have no semantic meaning.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.508
It doesn't matter how you are
or what the day is like.

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:25.401
They have something else.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.312
They have social meaning.

00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:30.530
What we mean when we say those things is:

00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:31.815
I see you there.

00:00:33.764 --> 00:00:36.561
I'm obsessed with talking to strangers.

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:39.475
I make eye contact, say hello,

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:42.064
I offer help, I listen.

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.379
I get all kinds of stories.

00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:49.040
About seven years ago, I started
documenting my experiences

00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:50.939
to try to figure out why.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.939
What I found was that something
really beautiful was going on.

00:00:55.963 --> 00:00:57.757
This is almost poetic.

00:00:58.184 --> 00:01:01.454
These were really profound experiences.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.358
They were unexpected pleasures.

00:01:03.382 --> 00:01:05.847
They were genuine emotional connections.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.242
They were liberating moments.

00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:14.202
So one day, I was standing on a corner
waiting for the light to change,

00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:15.535
which, I'm a New Yorker,

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:19.066
so that means I was actually standing
in the street on the storm drain,

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.014
as if that could get me across faster.

00:01:22.038 --> 00:01:24.039
And there's an old man
standing next to me.

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:28.890
So he's wearing, like, a long overcoat
and sort of an old-man hat,

00:01:28.914 --> 00:01:31.040
and he looked like somebody from a movie.

00:01:31.064 --> 00:01:32.262
And he says to me,

00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:34.837
"Don't stand there. You might disappear."

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.362
So this is absurd, right?

00:01:37.386 --> 00:01:40.382
But I did what he said.
I stepped back onto the sidewalk.

00:01:40.697 --> 00:01:42.589
And he smiled, and he said,

00:01:42.613 --> 00:01:44.494
"Good. You never know.

00:01:44.518 --> 00:01:45.945
I might have turned around,

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.476
and zoop, you're gone."

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:50.853
This was weird,

00:01:51.638 --> 00:01:54.067
and also really wonderful.

00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:57.408
He was so warm, and he was
so happy that he'd saved me.

00:01:57.977 --> 00:01:59.474
We had this little bond.

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:04.150
For a minute, I felt like
my existence as a person

00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:05.517
had been noticed,

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.270
and I was worth saving.

00:02:11.058 --> 00:02:12.685
The really sad thing is,

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.382
in many parts of the world,

00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:18.336
we're raised to believe
that strangers are dangerous by default,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.478
that we can't trust them,
that they might hurt us.

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.967
But most strangers aren't dangerous.

00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:28.279
We're uneasy around them
because we have no context.

00:02:28.807 --> 00:02:31.004
We don't know what their intentions are.

00:02:31.028 --> 00:02:34.811
So instead of using our perceptions
and making choices,

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:37.280
we rely on this category of "stranger."

00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:40.837
I have a four-year-old.

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:42.836
When I say hello to people on the street,

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:44.169
she asks me why.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.396
She says, "Do we know them?"

00:02:48.324 --> 00:02:50.181
I say, "No, they're our neighbor."

00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:52.308
"Are they our friend?"

00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:54.998
"No, it's just good to be friendly."

00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:59.102
I think twice every time
I say that to her,

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:02.634
because I mean it,
but as a woman, particularly,

00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:06.428
I know that not every stranger
on the street has the best intentions.

00:03:06.873 --> 00:03:10.727
It is good to be friendly,
and it's good to learn when not to be,

00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.107
but none of that means
we have to be afraid.

00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:17.324
There are two huge benefits

00:03:17.348 --> 00:03:20.443
to using our senses instead of our fears.

00:03:21.015 --> 00:03:24.015
The first one is that it liberates us.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.843
When you think about it,

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:30.079
using perception instead of categories

00:03:30.103 --> 00:03:32.006
is much easier said than done.

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.074
Categories are something our brains use.

00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:37.330
When it comes to people,

00:03:37.354 --> 00:03:39.765
it's sort of a shortcut
for learning about them.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.538
We see male, female, young, old,

00:03:44.562 --> 00:03:48.924
black, brown, white, stranger, friend,

00:03:48.948 --> 00:03:51.353
and we use the information in that box.

00:03:52.112 --> 00:03:53.830
It's quick, it's easy

00:03:53.854 --> 00:03:55.630
and it's a road to bias.

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:59.921
And it means we're not thinking
about people as individuals.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:05.111
I know an American researcher
who travels frequently

00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:07.945
in Central Asia and Africa, alone.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.449
She's entering into towns and cities

00:04:11.473 --> 00:04:13.524
as a complete stranger.

00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:16.102
She has no bonds, no connections.

00:04:16.126 --> 00:04:17.475
She's a foreigner.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:20.333
Her survival strategy is this:

00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:24.334
get one stranger to see you
as a real, individual person.

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:28.239
If you can do that, it'll help
other people see you that way, too.

00:04:28.817 --> 00:04:33.225
The second benefit of using our senses
has to do with intimacy.

00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:36.398
I know it sounds
a little counterintuitive,

00:04:36.422 --> 00:04:38.519
intimacy and strangers,

00:04:38.543 --> 00:04:42.595
but these quick interactions
can lead to a feeling

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:45.761
that sociologists call
"fleeting intimacy."

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:50.135
So, it's a brief experience
that has emotional resonance and meaning.

00:04:51.452 --> 00:04:53.460
It's the good feeling I got

00:04:53.484 --> 00:04:57.826
from being saved from the death trap
of the storm drain by the old man,

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.110
or how I feel like part of a community

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:04.553
when I talk to somebody
on my train on the way to work.

00:05:05.665 --> 00:05:07.689
Sometimes it goes further.

00:05:07.713 --> 00:05:12.826
Researchers have found
that people often feel more comfortable

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.094
being honest and open
about their inner selves with strangers

00:05:16.118 --> 00:05:18.801
than they do with their friends
and their families --

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.727
that they often feel
more understood by strangers.

00:05:25.022 --> 00:05:28.553
This gets reported in the media
with great lament.

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:31.926
"Strangers communicate
better than spouses!"

00:05:32.901 --> 00:05:34.434
It's a good headline, right?

00:05:35.547 --> 00:05:37.827
I think it entirely misses the point.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.153
The important thing about these studies

00:05:41.177 --> 00:05:43.970
is just how significant
these interactions can be;

00:05:44.795 --> 00:05:47.899
how this special form of closeness

00:05:47.923 --> 00:05:50.701
gives us something we need
as much as we need our friends

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.915
and our families.

00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:56.843
So how is it possible that we communicate
so well with strangers?

00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:00.221
There are two reasons.

00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:03.159
The first one is that
it's a quick interaction.

00:06:03.183 --> 00:06:04.722
It has no consequences.

00:06:05.034 --> 00:06:08.619
It's easy to be honest with someone
you're never going to see again, right?

00:06:08.643 --> 00:06:09.793
That makes sense.

00:06:10.177 --> 00:06:13.061
The second reason is where
it gets more interesting.

00:06:13.085 --> 00:06:16.502
We have a bias when it comes
to people we're close to.

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:20.526
We expect them to understand us.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.779
We assume they do,

00:06:21.803 --> 00:06:23.939
and we expect them to read our minds.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:27.021
So imagine you're at a party,

00:06:27.045 --> 00:06:30.647
and you can't believe
that your friend or your spouse

00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:33.474
isn't picking up on it
that you want to leave early.

00:06:33.498 --> 00:06:34.872
And you're thinking,

00:06:34.896 --> 00:06:36.418
"I gave you the look."

00:06:38.696 --> 00:06:41.211
With a stranger, we have
to start from scratch.

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:42.622
We tell the whole story,

00:06:43.376 --> 00:06:46.464
we explain who the people are,
how we feel about them;

00:06:46.488 --> 00:06:48.656
we spell out all the inside jokes.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.156
And guess what?

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.841
Sometimes they do
understand us a little better.

00:06:54.087 --> 00:06:55.247
OK.

00:06:55.271 --> 00:06:58.767
So now that we know
that talking to strangers matters,

00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:00.183
how does it work?

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:03.471
There are unwritten rules
we tend to follow.

00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:07.291
The rules are very different
depending on what country you're in,

00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:09.008
what culture you're in.

00:07:09.032 --> 00:07:11.161
In most parts of the US,

00:07:11.185 --> 00:07:13.439
the baseline expectation in public

00:07:13.464 --> 00:07:17.588
is that we maintain a balance
between civility and privacy.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.620
This is known as civil inattention.

00:07:21.263 --> 00:07:25.023
So, imagine two people are walking
towards each other on the street.

00:07:25.047 --> 00:07:27.345
They'll glance at each other
from a distance.

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:29.351
That's the civility, the acknowledgment.

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:31.582
And then as they get closer,
they'll look away,

00:07:31.606 --> 00:07:33.192
to give each other some space.

00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:36.413
In other cultures,

00:07:36.437 --> 00:07:41.344
people go to extraordinary lengths
not to interact at all.

00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:44.767
People from Denmark tell me

00:07:44.791 --> 00:07:48.399
that many Danes are so averse
to talking to strangers,

00:07:48.423 --> 00:07:51.641
that they would rather
miss their stop on the bus

00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:55.016
than say "excuse me" to someone
that they need to get around.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.329
Instead, there's this elaborate
shuffling of bags

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:01.836
and using your body to say
that you need to get past,

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.691
instead of using two words.

00:08:06.178 --> 00:08:08.047
In Egypt, I'm told,

00:08:08.731 --> 00:08:11.023
it's rude to ignore a stranger,

00:08:11.047 --> 00:08:14.280
and there's a remarkable
culture of hospitality.

00:08:15.312 --> 00:08:18.368
Strangers might ask each other
for a sip of water.

00:08:18.392 --> 00:08:21.096
Or, if you ask someone for directions,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.178
they're very likely
to invite you home for coffee.

00:08:25.441 --> 00:08:28.969
We see these unwritten rules
most clearly when they're broken,

00:08:29.563 --> 00:08:31.646
or when you're in a new place

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.867
and you're trying to figure out
what the right thing to do is.

00:08:35.332 --> 00:08:40.393
Sometimes breaking the rules a little bit
is where the action is.

00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:47.020
In case it's not clear,
I really want you to do this. OK?

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.679
So here's how it's going to go.

00:08:49.703 --> 00:08:51.729
Find somebody who is making eye contact.

00:08:51.753 --> 00:08:53.442
That's a good signal.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:55.609
The first thing is a simple smile.

00:08:56.402 --> 00:09:00.318
If you're passing somebody on the street
or in the hallway here, smile.

00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:01.610
See what happens.

00:09:02.113 --> 00:09:04.150
Another is triangulation.

00:09:04.552 --> 00:09:06.231
There's you, there's a stranger,

00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:10.364
there's some third thing
that you both might see and comment on,

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.121
like a piece of public art

00:09:13.145 --> 00:09:15.270
or somebody preaching in the street

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:17.882
or somebody wearing funny clothes.

00:09:18.689 --> 00:09:19.840
Give it a try.

00:09:19.864 --> 00:09:23.848
Make a comment about that third thing,
and see if starts a conversation.

00:09:24.621 --> 00:09:26.345
Another is what I call noticing.

00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:28.328
This is usually giving a compliment.

00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:32.259
I'm a big fan of noticing people's shoes.

00:09:32.283 --> 00:09:35.039
I'm actually not wearing
fabulous shoes right now,

00:09:35.063 --> 00:09:37.222
but shoes are fabulous in general.

00:09:37.817 --> 00:09:41.943
And they're pretty neutral
as far as giving compliments goes.

00:09:41.967 --> 00:09:45.575
People always want to tell you things
about their awesome shoes.

00:09:45.599 --> 00:09:49.496
You may have already experienced
the dogs and babies principle.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.938
It can be awkward
to talk to someone on the street;

00:09:51.962 --> 00:09:54.033
you don't know how
they're going to respond.

00:09:54.057 --> 00:09:56.599
But you can always talk
to their dog or their baby.

00:09:56.623 --> 00:09:57.972
The dog or the baby

00:09:57.996 --> 00:10:00.582
is a social conduit to the person,

00:10:01.095 --> 00:10:03.132
and you can tell by how they respond

00:10:03.156 --> 00:10:05.083
whether they're open to talking more.

00:10:06.156 --> 00:10:08.321
The last one I want to challenge you to

00:10:08.345 --> 00:10:09.841
is disclosure.

00:10:10.548 --> 00:10:12.890
This is a very vulnerable thing to do,

00:10:12.914 --> 00:10:14.430
and it can be very rewarding.

00:10:15.068 --> 00:10:17.160
So next time you're talking to a stranger

00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:19.220
and you feel comfortable,

00:10:19.966 --> 00:10:22.316
tell them something true about yourself,

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.680
something really personal.

00:10:24.103 --> 00:10:27.894
You might have that experience
I talked about of feeling understood.

00:10:29.854 --> 00:10:31.800
Sometimes in conversation, it comes up,

00:10:31.824 --> 00:10:35.181
people ask me, "What does your dad do?"
or, "Where does he live?"

00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:37.427
And sometimes I tell them the whole truth,

00:10:37.451 --> 00:10:39.608
which is that he died when I was a kid.

00:10:41.386 --> 00:10:43.403
Always in those moments,

00:10:43.427 --> 00:10:45.899
they share their own experiences of loss.

00:10:46.407 --> 00:10:49.543
We tend to meet
disclosure with disclosure,

00:10:49.567 --> 00:10:50.968
even with strangers.

00:10:52.453 --> 00:10:54.105
So, here it is.

00:10:55.425 --> 00:10:59.279
When you talk to strangers,
you're making beautiful interruptions

00:10:59.303 --> 00:11:02.789
into the expected narrative
of your daily life

00:11:02.813 --> 00:11:04.032
and theirs.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.933
You're making unexpected connections.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.983
If you don't talk to strangers,
you're missing out on all of that.

00:11:13.544 --> 00:11:15.822
We spend a lot of time

00:11:15.846 --> 00:11:18.423
teaching our children about strangers.

00:11:18.764 --> 00:11:22.657
What would happen if we spent
more time teaching ourselves?

00:11:23.441 --> 00:11:27.784
We could reject all the ideas
that make us so suspicious of each other.

00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:31.284
We could make a space for change.

00:11:32.141 --> 00:11:33.292
Thank you.

00:11:33.316 --> 00:11:39.222
(Applause)
