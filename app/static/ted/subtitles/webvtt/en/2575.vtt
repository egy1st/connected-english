00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.576
The conventional wisdom
about our world today

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.720
is that this is a time
of terrible decline.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.696
And that's not surprising,
given the bad news all around us,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.816
from ISIS to inequality,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.256
political dysfunction, climate change,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.320
Brexit, and on and on.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.680
But here's the thing,
and this may sound a little weird.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.000
I actually don't buy
this gloomy narrative,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.736
and I don't think you should either.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.256
Look, it's not that
I don't see the problems.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.120
I read the same headlines that you do.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.816
What I dispute is the conclusion
that so many people draw from them,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.736
namely that we're all screwed

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.856
because the problems are unsolvable

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.216
and our governments are useless.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.616
Now, why do I say this?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.336
It's not like I'm particularly
optimistic by nature.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.056
But something about the media's
constant doom-mongering

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.776
with its fixation on problems
and not on answers

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.936
has always really bugged me.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.056
So a few years ago I decided,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.976
well, I'm a journalist,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.976
I should see if I can do any better

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.536
by going around the world
and actually asking folks

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.816
if and how they've tackled

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.320
their big economic
and political challenges.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.600
And what I found astonished me.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.200
It turns out that there are remarkable
signs of progress out there,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.776
often in the most unexpected places,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.976
and they've convinced me
that our great global challenges

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.016
may not be so unsolvable after all.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.736
Not only are there theoretical fixes;

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.856
those fixes have been tried.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.616
They've worked.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.640
And they offer hope for the rest of us.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.016
I'm going to show you what I mean

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.896
by telling you about
how three of the countries I visited --

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.536
Canada, Indonesia and Mexico --

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.880
overcame three supposedly
impossible problems.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.816
Their stories matter because they contain
tools the rest of us can use,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.776
and not just for those
particular problems,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.160
but for many others, too.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.336
When most people think
about my homeland, Canada, today,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.980
if they think about Canada at all,

00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:10.616
they think cold, they think boring,
they think polite.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.840
They think we say "sorry" too much
in our funny accents.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.016
And that's all true.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.576
(Laughter)

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.816
Sorry.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.336
(Laughter)

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.080
But Canada's also important

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.056
because of its triumph over a problem

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.736
currently tearing
many other countries apart:

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.056
immigration.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.496
Consider, Canada today is among
the world's most welcoming nations,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.176
even compared to other
immigration-friendly countries.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.936
Its per capita immigration rate
is four times higher than France's,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.136
and its percentage
of foreign-born residents

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.056
is double that of Sweden.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.816
Meanwhile, Canada admitted

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.576
10 times more Syrian refugees
in the last year

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.296
than did the United States.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.560
(Applause)

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.936
And now Canada is taking even more.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.816
And yet, if you ask Canadians

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.496
what makes them proudest of their country,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.976
they rank "multiculturalism,"

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.216
a dirty word in most places,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.456
second,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.040
ahead of hockey.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.936
Hockey.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.000
(Laughter)

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.136
In other words,
at a time when other countries

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.416
are now frantically building
new barriers to keep foreigners out,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.320
Canadians want even more of them in.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.496
Now, here's the really interesting part.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.936
Canada wasn't always like this.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.400
Until the mid-1960s, Canada followed
an explicitly racist immigration policy.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.776
They called it "White Canada,"

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.720
and as you can see, they were not
just talking about the snow.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.280
So how did that Canada
become today's Canada?

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.736
Well, despite what my mom
in Ontario will tell you,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.736
the answer had nothing to do with virtue.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.136
Canadians are not inherently
better than anyone else.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.816
The real explanation involves the man
who became Canada's leader in 1968,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.096
Pierre Trudeau, who is also
the father of the current prime minister.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.520
(Applause)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.016
The thing to know about that first Trudeau

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.935
is that he was very different
from Canada's previous leaders.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.456
He was a French speaker in a country
long-dominated by its English elite.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.056
He was an intellectual.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.856
He was even kind of groovy.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.536
I mean, seriously, the guy did yoga.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.941
He hung out with the Beatles.

00:04:30.965 --> 00:04:32.056
(Laughter)

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.040
And like all hipsters,
he could be infuriating at times.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.416
But he nevertheless pulled off

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.120
one of the most progressive
transformations any country has ever seen.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.696
His formula, I've learned,
involved two parts.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.696
First, Canada threw out
its old race-based immigration rules,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.536
and it replaced them
with new color-blind ones

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.736
that emphasized education,
experience and language skills instead.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.256
And what that did
was greatly increase the odds

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.960
that newcomers would
contribute to the economy.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.216
Then part two, Trudeau
created the world's first policy

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.416
of official multiculturalism
to promote integration

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.600
and the idea that diversity
was the key to Canada's identity.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.016
Now, in the years that followed,
Ottawa kept pushing this message,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.816
but at the same time, ordinary Canadians

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.336
soon started to see the economic,
the material benefits of multiculturalism

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.616
all around them.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.256
And these two influences soon combined

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.880
to create the passionately
open-minded Canada of today.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.136
Let's now turn to another country
and an even tougher problem,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.360
Islamic extremism.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.696
In 1998, the people of Indonesia
took to the streets

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.600
and overthrew
their longtime dictator, Suharto.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.616
It was an amazing moment,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.376
but it was also a scary one.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.096
With 250 million people,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.216
Indonesia is the largest
Muslim-majority country on Earth.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.216
It's also hot, huge and unruly,

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.536
made up of 17,000 islands,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.846
where people speak
close to a thousand languages.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.176
Now, Suharto had been a dictator,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.816
and a nasty one.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.936
But he'd also been
a pretty effective tyrant,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.256
and he'd always been careful
to keep religion out of politics.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.856
So experts feared that without
him keeping a lid on things,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.616
the country would explode,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.536
or religious extremists would take over

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.440
and turn Indonesia
into a tropical version of Iran.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.336
And that's just what seemed
to happen at first.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.456
In the country's
first free elections, in 1999,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.856
Islamist parties scored
36 percent of the vote,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.536
and the islands burned

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.480
as riots and terror attacks
killed thousands.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.040
Since then, however,
Indonesia has taken a surprising turn.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.496
While ordinary folks have grown
more pious on a personal level --

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.696
I saw a lot more headscarves
on a recent visit

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.656
than I would have a decade ago --

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.160
the country's politics
have moved in the opposite direction.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.480
Indonesia is now
a pretty decent democracy.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.256
And yet, its Islamist parties
have steadily lost support,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.616
from a high of about 38 percent in 2004

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.880
down to 25 percent in 2014.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.016
As for terrorism, it's now extremely rare.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.416
And while a few Indonesians
have recently joined ISIS,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.640
their number is tiny,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.816
far fewer in per capita terms

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.040
than the number of Belgians.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.736
Try to think of one other
Muslim-majority country

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.176
that can say all those same things.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.096
In 2014, I went to Indonesia
to ask its current president,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.696
a soft-spoken technocrat
named Joko Widodo,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.160
"Why is Indonesia thriving when
so many other Muslim states are dying?"

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.936
"Well, what we realized," he told me,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.816
"is that to deal with extremism,
we needed to deal with inequality first."

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.376
See, Indonesia's religious parties,
like similar parties elsewhere,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.280
had tended to focus on things like
reducing poverty and cutting corruption.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.616
So that's what Joko
and his predecessors did too,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.560
thereby stealing the Islamists' thunder.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.096
They also cracked down hard on terrorism,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.696
but Indonesia's democrats
have learned a key lesson

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.656
from the dark years of dictatorship,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.320
namely that repression
only creates more extremism.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.976
So they waged their war
with extraordinary delicacy.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.056
They used the police instead of the army.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.096
They only detained suspects
if they had enough evidence.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.696
They held public trials.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.416
They even sent
liberal imams into the jails

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.960
to persuade the jihadists
that terror is un-Islamic.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.856
And all of this paid off
in spectacular fashion,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.360
creating the kind of country
that was unimaginable 20 years ago.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.696
So at this point,
my optimism should, I hope,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.536
be starting to make a bit more sense.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.640
Neither immigration nor Islamic extremism
are impossible to deal with.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.496
Join me now on one last trip,

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.160
this time to Mexico.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.136
Now, of our three stories,
this one probably surprised me the most,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.576
since as you all know,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.696
the country is still struggling
with so many problems.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.376
And yet, a few years ago,
Mexico did something

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.536
that many other countries
from France to India to the United States

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.456
can still only dream of.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.040
It shattered the political paralysis
that had gripped it for years.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.176
To understand how,
we need to rewind to the year 2000,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.776
when Mexico finally became a democracy.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.976
Rather than use their new freedoms
to fight for reform,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.336
Mexico's politicians used them
to fight one another.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.296
Congress deadlocked,
and the country's problems --

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.376
drugs, poverty, crime, corruption --

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.976
spun out of control.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.616
Things got so bad that in 2008,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.520
the Pentagon warned
that Mexico risked collapse.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.056
Then in 2012, this guy
named Enrique Peña Nieto

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.960
somehow got himself elected president.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.680
Now, this Peña hardly inspired
much confidence at first.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.920
Sure, he was handsome,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.856
but he came from Mexico's
corrupt old ruling party, the PRI,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.720
and he was a notorious womanizer.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.576
In fact, he seemed
like such a pretty boy lightweight

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.376
that women called him "bombón," sweetie,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.600
at campaign rallies.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.976
And yet this same bombón
soon surprised everyone

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.256
by hammering out a truce

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.296
between the country's
three warring political parties.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.896
And over the next 18 months,
they together passed

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.856
an incredibly comprehensive
set of reforms.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.936
They busted open Mexico's
smothering monopolies.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.600
They liberalized
its rusting energy sector.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.416
They restructured
its failing schools, and much more.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.656
To appreciate the scale
of this accomplishment,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.896
try to imagine the US Congress
passing immigration reform,

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.856
campaign finance reform
and banking reform.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.320
Now, try to imagine Congress
doing it all at the same time.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.120
That's what Mexico did.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.520
Not long ago, I met with Peña
and asked how he managed it all.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.416
The President flashed me
his famous twinkly smile --

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.200
(Laughter)

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.576
and told me that the short answer
was "compromiso," compromise.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.336
Of course, I pushed him for details,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.896
and the long answer
that came out was essentially

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.520
"compromise, compromise
and more compromise."

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.056
See, Peña knew that he needed
to build trust early,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.856
so he started talking to the opposition
just days after his election.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.216
To ward off pressure
from special interests,

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.016
he kept their meetings small and secret,

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.336
and many of the participants
later told me that it was this intimacy,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.016
plus a lot of shared tequila,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.960
that helped build confidence.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.456
So did the fact that all decisions
had to be unanimous,

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.616
and that Peña even agreed to pass
some of the other party's priorities

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.840
before his own.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.856
As Santiago Creel,
an opposition senator, put it to me,

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.536
"Look, I'm not saying that I'm special
or that anyone is special,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.400
but that group, that was special."

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.256
The proof?

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.616
When Peña was sworn in, the pact held,

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.800
and Mexico moved forward
for the first time in years.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.736
Bueno.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.056
So now we've seen
how these three countries

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.616
overcame three of their great challenges.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.456
And that's very nice for them, right?

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.160
But what good does it do the rest of us?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.576
Well, in the course of studying these
and a bunch of other success stories,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.736
like the way Rwanda pulled itself
back together after civil war

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.496
or Brazil has reduced inequality,

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.256
or South Korea has kept its economy
growing faster and for longer

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.216
than any other country on Earth,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.696
I've noticed a few common threads.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.816
Now, before describing them,
I need to add a caveat.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.456
I realize, of course,
that all countries are unique.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.176
So you can't simply
take what worked in one,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.896
port it to another
and expect it to work there too.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.256
Nor do specific solutions work forever.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.040
You've got to adapt them
as circumstances change.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.496
That said, by stripping
these stories to their essence,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.176
you absolutely can distill
a few common tools for problem-solving

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.136
that will work in other countries

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.456
and in boardrooms

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.800
and in all sorts of other contexts, too.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.936
Number one, embrace the extreme.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.896
In all the stories we've just looked at,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.840
salvation came at a moment
of existential peril.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.616
And that was no coincidence.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.960
Take Canada: when Trudeau took office,
he faced two looming dangers.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.296
First, though his vast,
underpopulated country

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.936
badly needed more bodies,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.576
its preferred source
for white workers, Europe,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.656
had just stopped exporting them
as it finally recovered from World War II.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.176
The other problem was
that Canada's long cold war

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.016
between its French
and its English communities

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.680
had just become a hot one.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.456
Quebec was threatening to secede,

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.256
and Canadians were actually
killing other Canadians over politics.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.736
Now, countries face
crises all the time. Right?

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.000
That's nothing special.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.736
But Trudeau's genius
was to realize that Canada's crisis

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.320
had swept away all the hurdles
that usually block reform.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.240
Canada had to open up. It had no choice.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.816
And it had to rethink its identity.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.536
Again, it had no choice.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.096
And that gave Trudeau
a once-in-a-generation opportunity

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.720
to break the old rules and write new ones.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.840
And like all our other heroes,
he was smart enough to seize it.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.120
Number two, there's power
in promiscuous thinking.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.136
Another striking similarity
among good problem-solvers

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.176
is that they're all pragmatists.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.376
They'll steal the best answers
from wherever they find them,

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.776
and they don't let details

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:51.136
like party or ideology
or sentimentality get in their way.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.456
As I mentioned earlier,
Indonesia's democrats were clever enough

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:59.256
to steal many of the Islamists'
best campaign promises for themselves.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.176
They even invited some of the radicals
into their governing coalition.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.720
Now, that horrified
a lot of secular Indonesians.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.696
But by forcing the radicals
to actually help govern,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.576
it quickly exposed the fact
that they weren't any good at the job,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.616
and it got them mixed up
in all of the grubby compromises

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.696
and petty humiliations
that are part of everyday politics.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.120
And that hurt their image so badly
that they've never recovered.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.616
Number three,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.480
please all of the people some of the time.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.296
I know I just mentioned how crises
can grant leaders extraordinary freedoms.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.296
And that's true, but problem-solving
often requires more than just boldness.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.896
It takes showing restraint, too,

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.576
just when that's
the last thing you want to do.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.536
Take Trudeau: when he took office,

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.136
he could easily have put
his core constituency,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.816
that is Canada's French community, first.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.280
He could have pleased
some of the people all of the time.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.456
And Peña could have used his power
to keep attacking the opposition,

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.256
as was traditional in Mexico.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.416
Yet he chose to embrace
his enemies instead,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.936
while forcing his own party to compromise.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.136
And Trudeau pushed everyone
to stop thinking in tribal terms

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.656
and to see multiculturalism,
not language and not skin color,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.160
as what made them
quintessentially Canadian.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.456
Nobody got everything they wanted,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.800
but everyone got just enough
that the bargains held.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.976
So at this point you may be thinking,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.216
"OK, Tepperman,

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.976
if the fixes really are out there
like you keep insisting,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.520
then why aren't more countries
already using them?"

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.216
It's not like they require
special powers to pull off.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.816
I mean, none of the leaders
we've just looked at were superheroes.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.976
They didn't accomplish
anything on their own,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.176
and they all had plenty of flaws.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.616
Take Indonesia's
first democratic president,

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.296
Abdurrahman Wahid.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.536
This man was so powerfully uncharismatic

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.656
that he once fell asleep

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.456
in the middle of his own speech.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.096
(Laughter)

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.320
True story.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.656
So what this tells us
is that the real obstacle is not ability,

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.496
and it's not circumstances.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.576
It's something much simpler.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:19.576
Making big changes
involves taking big risks,

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.640
and taking big risks is scary.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.816
Overcoming that fear requires guts,

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.175
and as you all know,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.640
gutsy politicians are painfully rare.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.216
But that doesn't mean we voters

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.976
can't demand courage
from our political leaders.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.810
I mean, that's why we put them
in office in the first place.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.960
And given the state of the world today,
there's really no other option.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.696
The answers are out there,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.056
but now it's up to us

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.616
to elect more women and men

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.016
brave enough to find them,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.416
to steal them

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.056
and to make them work.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.456
Thank you.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.791
(Applause)
