00:00:01.277 --> 00:00:04.344
(Music)

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.606
Rainn Wilson: It takes
its toll, being alone.

00:00:09.937 --> 00:00:11.120
I'm a little bit lost,

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:14.057
and it's finally time
to make a real connection.

00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:15.819
Who am I?

00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:17.847
(Drums)

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:20.264
I'm a single white male,

00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:22.141
45 years of age.

00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:23.588
I love animals.

00:00:24.283 --> 00:00:25.781
Gainfully employed.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.212
I'm a people person.

00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:31.103
I keep fit.

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:34.042
Who am I looking for?

00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:36.971
I'm looking for my idea mate.

00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:40.385
Are you that idea
that matches with who I really am?

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.266
(Video) Ron Finley: How would you feel

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.845
if you had no access to healthy food?

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:50.432
Gardening is the most therapeutic
and defiant act you can do.

00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:56.249
RW: Wow, we sure are getting
our fingers dirty for a first date, huh?

00:00:56.273 --> 00:01:00.051
RF: Gardening is the most therapeutic
and defiant act you can do.

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:02.743
People in these areas --
they're exposed to crappy food.

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:05.035
I want people to know
that growing your own food

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.607
is like printing your own money.

00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:08.218
RW: You're like a food superhero!

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:10.565
RF: Food is the problem
and food is the solution.

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:12.266
(Music)

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.873
Erin McKean: I'm a lexicographer.

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:17.537
My job is to put every word
possible into the dictionary.

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:18.901
RW: I love words, too --

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:21.536
just as much as any lexi-ta-tographer.

00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:24.930
What if you love a word
that you've just made up,

00:01:24.954 --> 00:01:26.890
like -- I don't know -- "scuberfinkles"?

00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:28.897
Beau Lotto: Do you think you see reality?

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.228
RW: Well, I'm a little
nearsighted, but yeah.

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:32.752
BL: Well, you can't -- I mean,

00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:34.723
your brain has no access to this world.

00:01:34.747 --> 00:01:37.980
In fact, even the sensory information
that your eyes are receiving,

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:39.161
your ears are receiving,

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:41.859
is completely meaningless
because it could mean anything.

00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:44.602
That tree could be a large object far away

00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:45.940
or a small object up close,

00:01:45.964 --> 00:01:47.907
and your brain has no way of knowing.

00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:51.141
RW: Once I thought I saw Bigfoot
but it was just a German shepherd.

00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:54.302
Isabel Behncke Izquierdo: Bonobos
are, together with chimpanzees,

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:55.797
your closest living relatives.

00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:58.365
Bonobos have frequent and promiscuous sex

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.441
to manage conflict
and solve social issues.

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:03.189
RW: I'm just curious:

00:02:03.213 --> 00:02:05.403
Do we have any conflict
that needs managing

00:02:05.427 --> 00:02:07.443
or social issues to resolve?

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:10.709
IBI: Remember --
you're on a date with my idea,

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:11.921
not me.

00:02:13.228 --> 00:02:16.430
Jane McGonigal: This is the face
of someone who, against all odds,

00:02:16.454 --> 00:02:18.216
is on the verge of an epic win.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.441
RW: An epic win?

00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:23.069
JM: An epic win is an outcome
so extraordinarily positive,

00:02:23.093 --> 00:02:26.470
you didn't even know it was possible
until you achieved it.

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:29.768
You're not making the face.

00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:35.459
You're making the "I'm not
good at life" face.

00:02:35.483 --> 00:02:37.753
RW: Arthur, I want to be
really honest with you.

00:02:37.777 --> 00:02:39.872
I am seeing other ideas. OK?

00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:41.053
I'm dating around.

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:42.362
That's the situation.

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:44.231
Arthur Benjamin: I'd say this:

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:46.684
Mathematics is not just solving for x,

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.842
it's also figuring out why.

00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:51.277
RW: Do you want to get some pie?

00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:52.455
AB: Pi?

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.853
3.14159265358979 --

00:02:56.877 --> 00:03:00.021
Reggie Watts: If we're going
to do something,

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:01.872
we've got to just make a decision.

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:04.441
Because without a decision
we're left powerless.

00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:05.737
Without power,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.742
we have nothing to supply

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:11.078
the chain of those who are truly curious

00:03:11.102 --> 00:03:13.360
to solve all of our current conditions.

00:03:14.242 --> 00:03:16.283
RW: And, "If you choose not to decide,

00:03:16.307 --> 00:03:18.434
you still have made a choice" -- Rush.

00:03:19.172 --> 00:03:20.332
JM: Yes!

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:21.867
This is the face we need to see

00:03:21.891 --> 00:03:23.985
on millions of problem solvers worldwide,

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.038
as we try to tackle the challenges
of the next century.

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:30.473
RW: So, are we going Dutch?

00:03:30.497 --> 00:03:35.444
AB: 3846264338327950

00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:37.728
28841...

00:03:38.907 --> 00:03:40.106
971?

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:42.811
RW: One night, want to go
to a movie or something?

00:03:42.835 --> 00:03:44.713
RF: Hell, no! Let's go plant some shit!

00:03:44.737 --> 00:03:45.980
RW: Let's plant some shit!

00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:47.981
Good, now what is this that I'm planting?

00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:49.161
Bonobos!

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:51.323
IBI: Bonobos! (Laughs)

00:03:51.347 --> 00:03:52.696
Bonobos.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.637
RWatts: Um, interested much?

00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:58.619
RW: I want to have your idea baby.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.097
RWatts: Well, you know
what they say in Russia.

00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:03.276
RW: Hm?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.609
RWatts: "scuberfinckle."

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:06.633
