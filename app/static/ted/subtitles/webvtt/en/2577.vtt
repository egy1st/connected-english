00:00:00.985 --> 00:00:02.792
It's funny the things you forget.

00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:07.499
I went to see my mother the other day,
and she told me this story

00:00:07.523 --> 00:00:09.691
that I'd completely
forgotten about

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:13.101
how, when we were driving together,
she would pull the car over,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.281
and by the time she had
gotten out of the car,

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:17.749
and gone around the car
to let me out of the car,

00:00:17.773 --> 00:00:19.851
I would have already gotten out of the car

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.114
and pretended to have died.

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:25.084
(Laughter)

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:29.456
(Applause)

00:00:35.386 --> 00:00:36.903
Because that's how you die.

00:00:36.927 --> 00:00:38.860
(Laughter)

00:00:38.884 --> 00:00:41.987
And I remember, that was a game
I used to play with myself

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.407
to entertain myself whenever
I was bored or frustrated.

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:47.570
(Laughter)

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:49.516
Settle down.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.533
(Laughter)

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.817
People say we live in an age
of information overload. Right?

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:56.005
I don't know about that,

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:58.592
but I just know that I get
too many marketing emails.

00:00:58.616 --> 00:01:01.065
I got a marketing email
from a supermarket firm,

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.898
which will remain nameless

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:04.868
for predominantly legal reasons,

00:01:04.892 --> 00:01:07.373
but which I'm going to call "SafeMart."

00:01:07.397 --> 00:01:09.455
(Laughter)

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.677
I got an email from them,
and it went like this, it said:

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:16.942
"Just three weeks until SafeMart
at King's Cross opens!!!"

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.378
And I resented this,

00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:22.573
because not only do I not remember
signing up to that,

00:01:22.597 --> 00:01:25.309
but I resent the fact
that they appear to think

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.475
that I should be excited
about a shop opening.

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.244
So what I did was I scrolled down
to the bottom of the email,

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:33.825
and I pressed, "Unsubscribe."

00:01:34.238 --> 00:01:36.071
And I thought that'd be the end of it.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.251
But a week later,
I got another one that said,

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:39.713
"Just two weeks

00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:42.579
until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:45.230
And I thought, obviously,
I haven't clicked hard enough.

00:01:45.254 --> 00:01:47.143
So I tried it again. Right?

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:50.739
Lo and behold, a week passes,
you guessed it,

00:01:50.763 --> 00:01:54.820
"Just one week until SafeMart
at King's Cross opens!!!"

00:01:54.844 --> 00:01:56.686
And here's the problem:

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.032
The internet gave us access to everything;

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.193
but it also gave everything access to us.

00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:04.750
It's hard enough to discriminate

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:07.329
between the things that genuinely
matter in this world

00:02:07.353 --> 00:02:08.877
and the minutiae of life,

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.576
without having emails
about supermarket chains

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.043
and Candy Crush Saga.

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:16.403
And I was really annoyed with them,

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:19.605
and I thought, OK, I was about to write
a strongly worded email,

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:20.890
which I can do quite well.

00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:22.707
(Laughter)

00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:24.366
And I thought, no --

00:02:25.252 --> 00:02:26.948
I'm going to find the game.

00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:29.081
So I replied to it, and I said,

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:30.905
"I literally cannot wait!!!!"

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:33.455
(Laughter)

00:02:35.173 --> 00:02:36.693
"What do you need from me?"

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:41.211
They got back to me;
a guy called Dan said,

00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:44.149
"Hi James. I've asked a colleague
to help me with your query."

00:02:44.173 --> 00:02:45.193
(Laughter)

00:02:45.217 --> 00:02:46.849
Like it needs help.

00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:50.119
And I said, "What's the plan, Dan?

00:02:50.143 --> 00:02:52.436
I'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ..."

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.655
(Laughter)

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.751
"I'm not sure what you mean."

00:02:57.775 --> 00:02:58.982
(Laughter)

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:02.309
I said, "I'm just tremendously
excited about the opening!"

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:03.768
(Laughter)

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:08.891
"Do you want to book
the bouncy castle or shall I?"

00:03:11.687 --> 00:03:13.839
He said, "I think you have misunderstood."

00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:15.378
(Laughter)

00:03:15.402 --> 00:03:18.393
"A new store is opening,
but there is no celebration planned."

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.579
I said, "But what was all the 'Three weeks
until,' 'Two weeks until' emails?

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:25.742
I was getting excited."

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:27.249
(Laughter)

00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:29.850
"I'm sorry you're disappointed."

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:31.874
(Laughter)

00:03:33.694 --> 00:03:35.029
I said, "Not to worry.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.989
Let's do something anyway!

00:03:39.381 --> 00:03:42.369
Besides, the deposit on the bouncy
castle was non-refundable."

00:03:42.393 --> 00:03:44.497
(Laughter)

00:03:46.812 --> 00:03:49.632
"If we don't use it, we're out
a few hundred quid, Dan."

00:03:49.656 --> 00:03:51.346
(Laughter)

00:03:52.718 --> 00:03:56.249
He said, "Mr. Veitch, I'm not responsible
for anything you have ordered."

00:03:57.454 --> 00:04:00.778
I said, "Let's not get into who did what.

00:04:02.182 --> 00:04:04.811
Bottom line: you and I
are in this together."

00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:07.079
(Laughter)

00:04:07.103 --> 00:04:08.733
(Applause)

00:04:11.452 --> 00:04:14.830
"Question: Will you be there
to make sure people take their shoes off?"

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:16.980
(Laughter)

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:22.875
I'll be honest, then my relationship
with Dan deteriorated somewhat,

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:25.224
because the next email I got was this:

00:04:25.248 --> 00:04:27.630
"Thanks for your email -
your Case Number is ..."

00:04:27.654 --> 00:04:29.654
(Laughter)

00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.132
That's outrageous.

00:04:31.156 --> 00:04:32.307
I said, "Dan?"

00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:34.171
(Laughter)

00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:37.117
And I got -- and I was just like,
this is ... -- and I, I ....

00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:38.937
And I said, "Danny?"

00:04:39.407 --> 00:04:44.023
And I thought, this is terrible.
All I'm doing is collecting case numbers.

00:04:44.047 --> 00:04:45.594
I said, "D-Dog?"

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.444
(Laughter)

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.326
"The store is now open."

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.350
(Laughter)

00:04:53.104 --> 00:04:57.618
I said, "But Dan, they must have wondered
why there was no bouncy castle."

00:04:58.587 --> 00:05:00.896
And then we were back to this.

00:05:03.123 --> 00:05:05.730
And that might have been
the end of the story,

00:05:05.754 --> 00:05:09.806
but I remembered
that anything -- everything --

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.402
even something as mundane
as getting out of a car,

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:15.352
can be fun if you find the right game.

00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:18.626
So,

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:21.253
this is what I replied:

00:05:22.063 --> 00:05:24.670
[Thanks for your email -
your Case Number is #0000001.]

00:05:24.694 --> 00:05:26.980
(Laughter)

00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:30.339
(Applause)

00:05:32.843 --> 00:05:34.238
And we just, uh ...

00:05:34.262 --> 00:05:36.263
(Laughter)

00:05:36.287 --> 00:05:38.440
It was like we were dancing.

00:05:38.464 --> 00:05:40.707
It was just a beautiful relationship.

00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:43.126
We just kept going.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.592
It was lovely.

00:05:44.616 --> 00:05:47.501
But to be honest, guys,
it was quite labor-intensive,

00:05:47.525 --> 00:05:50.570
and I had other stuff to do,

00:05:50.594 --> 00:05:51.983
believe it or not.

00:05:53.262 --> 00:05:58.991
So what I did is I have a little email
auto-replier program.

00:06:00.358 --> 00:06:03.493
And I set it up so every time
it receives an email from SafeMart,

00:06:03.517 --> 00:06:04.667
it just pings one back.

00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:06.042
So I set it up, and it says,

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:08.427
"Thanks for your email -
your Case Number is ..."

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:12.305
Then it has a little formula that I wrote
to up the case number every time.

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:13.614
And I put it on the server

00:06:14.455 --> 00:06:15.820
and set it running.

00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:21.446
(Laughter)

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.075
I'll be honest, guys --

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:25.495
then I forgot about it.

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:27.519
(Laughter)

00:06:28.453 --> 00:06:30.592
I checked back on it the other day,

00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:36.899
and it appears there have been
a number of emails going back and forth.

00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:40.646
We're on 21,439.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.852
(Applause)

00:06:47.252 --> 00:06:50.304
It gives me an immense
sense of satisfaction to know

00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:54.249
that these computer programs
are just going to be pinging one another

00:06:54.273 --> 00:06:55.742
for eternity.

00:06:56.926 --> 00:06:59.271
And as legacies go,
I don't think that's bad.

00:07:01.573 --> 00:07:03.383
So guys, just remember:

00:07:03.407 --> 00:07:06.860
if ever you feel weighed down
by the bureaucracy

00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:09.025
and often mundanity of modern life,

00:07:10.073 --> 00:07:11.898
don't fight the frustration.

00:07:14.263 --> 00:07:15.763
Let it be the catalyst

00:07:16.725 --> 00:07:17.890
for whimsy.

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:22.254
(Laughter)

00:07:22.278 --> 00:07:23.437
Thank you.

00:07:23.461 --> 00:07:27.293
(Applause)
