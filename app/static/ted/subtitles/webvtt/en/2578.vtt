00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.056
Twelve years ago, I picked up
a camera for the first time

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.200
to film the olive harvest
in a Palestinian village in the West Bank.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.296
I thought I was there
to make a single documentary

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.176
and would then move on
to some other part of the world.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.480
But something kept bringing me back.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.296
Now, usually, when international audiences
hear about that part of the world,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.856
they often just want
that conflict to go away.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.520
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is bad,
and we wish it could just disappear.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.480
We feel much the same way
about other conflicts around the world.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.296
But every time we turn
our attention to the news,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.280
it seems like one more country
has gone up in flames.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.016
So I've been wondering

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.360
whether we should not start
looking at conflict in a different way --

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.136
whether instead of simply
wishing to end conflict,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.176
we focus instead on how to wage conflict.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.256
This has been a big question for me,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.920
one I've pursued together with my team
at the nonprofit Just Vision.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.416
After witnessing several different kinds
of struggles in the Middle East,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.656
I started noticing some patterns
on the more successful ones.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.816
I wondered whether these variables
held across cases, and if they did,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.736
what lessons we could glean
for waging constructive conflict,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.600
in Palestine, Israel and elsewhere.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.920
There is some science about this.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.936
In a study of 323
major political conflicts

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.936
from 1900 to 2006,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.256
Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth
found that nonviolent campaigns

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.520
were almost 100 percent more likely
to lead to success than violent campaigns.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.376
Nonviolent campaigns are also
less likely to cause physical harm

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.336
to those waging the campaign,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.496
as well as their opponents.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.400
And, critically, they typically lead
to more peaceful and democratic societies.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.136
In other words, nonviolent resistance
is a more effective and constructive way

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.360
of waging conflict.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.920
But if that's such an easy choice,
why don't more groups use it?

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.896
Political scientist Victor Asal
and colleagues

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.696
have looked at several factors

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.280
that shape a political group's
choice of tactics.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.160
And it turns out
that the greatest predictor

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.336
of a movement's decision
to adopt nonviolence or violence

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.696
is not whether that group
is more left-wing or right-wing,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.816
not whether the group is more or less
influenced by religious beliefs,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.896
not whether it's up against
a democracy or a dictatorship,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.520
and not even the levels of repression
that that group is facing.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.320
The greatest predictor of a movement's
decision to adopt nonviolence

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.560
is its ideology regarding
the role of women in public life.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.600
(Applause)

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.096
When a movement includes in its discourse

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.856
language around gender equality,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.216
it increases dramatically
the chances it will adopt nonviolence,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.560
and thus, the likelihood it will succeed.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.056
The research squared up
with my own documentation

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.416
of political organizing
in Israel and Palestine.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.856
I've noticed that movements which
welcome women into leadership positions,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.176
such as the one I documented
in a village called Budrus,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.800
were much more likely
to achieve their goals.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.936
This village was under a real threat
of being wiped off the map

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.800
when Israel started building
the separation barrier.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.416
The proposed route would require

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.936
the destruction of this community's
olive groves, their cemeteries

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.800
and would ultimately
enclose the village from all sides.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.536
Through inspired local leadership,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.200
they launched a nonviolent resistance
campaign to stop that from happening.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.520
The odds were massively
stacked against them.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.920
But they had a secret weapon:

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.656
a 15-year-old girl

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.416
who courageously jumped
in front of a bulldozer

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.920
which was about to uproot
an olive tree, stopping it.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.216
In that moment, the community
of Budrus realized what was possible

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.840
if they welcomed and encouraged women
to participate in public life.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.416
And so it was that the women of Budrus
went to the front lines day after day,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.896
using their creativity and acumen
to overcome multiple obstacles they faced

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.000
in a 10-month unarmed struggle.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And as you can probably
tell at this point,

00:04:37.024 --> 00:04:38.224
they win at the end.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.696
The separation barrier
was changed completely

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.456
to the internationally
recognized green line,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.216
and the women of Budrus
came to be known across the West Bank

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.240
for their indomitable energy.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.296
(Applause)

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.680
Thank you.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.256
I want to pause for a second,
which you helped me do,

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.216
because I do want to tackle
two very serious misunderstandings

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.840
that could happen at this point.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.256
The first one is that I don't believe

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.320
women are inherently or essentially
more peaceful than men.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.176
But I do believe that in today's world,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.080
women experience power differently.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.456
Having had to navigate
being in the less powerful position

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.216
in multiple aspects of their lives,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.576
women are often more adept

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.856
at how to surreptitiously
pressure for change

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.616
against large, powerful actors.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.816
The term "manipulative," often charged
against women in a derogatory way,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.816
reflects a reality in which women
have often had to find ways

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.240
other than direct confrontation
to achieve their goals.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.976
And finding alternatives
to direct confrontation

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.080
is at the core of nonviolent resistance.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.856
Now to the second
potential misunderstanding.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.896
I've been talking a lot about
my experiences in the Middle East,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.736
and some of you might be thinking now

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.536
that the solution then is for us
to educate Muslim and Arab societies

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.280
to be more inclusive of their women.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.840
If we were to do that,
they would be more successful.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.120
They do not need this kind of help.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.296
Women have been part
of the most influential movements

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.840
coming out of the Middle East,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.056
but they tend to be invisible
to the international community.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.816
Our cameras are largely focused on the men

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.896
who often end up involved
in the more confrontational scenes

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.440
that we find so irresistible
in our news cycle.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.936
And we end up with a narrative
that not only erases women

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.896
from the struggles in the region

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.560
but often misrepresents
the struggles themselves.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.256
In the late 1980s,
an uprising started in Gaza,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.360
and quickly spread to the West Bank
and East Jerusalem.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.616
It came to be known as the First Intifada,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.976
and people who have
any visual memory of it

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.800
generally conjure up something like this:

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.640
Palestinian men
throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.296
The news coverage at the time

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.056
made it seem like stones,
Molotov cocktails and burning tires

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.120
were the only activities
taking place in the Intifada.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:40.336
This period, though, was also marked
by widespread nonviolent organizing

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.080
in the forms of strikes, sit-ins
and the creation of parallel institutions.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.256
During the First Intifada,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.616
whole sectors of the Palestinian
civilian population mobilized,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.400
cutting across generations,
factions and class lines.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.896
They did this through networks
of popular committees,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.416
and their use of direct action
and communal self-help projects

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.856
challenged Israel's very ability

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.560
to continue ruling the West Bank and Gaza.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.936
According to the Israeli Army itself,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.520
97 percent of activities
during the First Intifada were unarmed.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.640
And here's another thing that is not
part of our narrative about that time.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.776
For 18 months in the Intifada,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.616
women were the ones
calling the shots behind the scenes:

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.136
Palestinian women from all walks of life

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.576
in charge of mobilizing
hundreds of thousands of people

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.480
in a concerted effort to withdraw
consent from the occupation.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.056
Naela Ayesh, who strived to build
a self-sufficient Palestinian economy

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.296
by encouraging women in Gaza
to grow vegetables in their backyards,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.880
an activity deemed illegal
by the Israeli authorities at that time;

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.776
Rabeha Diab, who took over
decision-making authority

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.216
for the entire uprising

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.016
when the men who had been running it

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.240
were deported;

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.936
Fatima Al Jaafari, who swallowed leaflets
containing the uprising's directives

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.736
in order to spread them
across the territories

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.320
without getting caught;

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.376
and Zahira Kamal,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.696
who ensured the longevity of the uprising

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.256
by leading an organization

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.200
that went from 25 women
to 3,000 in a single year.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.176
Despite their extraordinary achievements,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.200
none of these women have made it
into our narrative of the First Intifada.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.000
We do this in other parts
of the globe, too.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.016
In our history books, for instance,
and in our collective consciousness,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.096
men are the public faces and spokespersons

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.200
for the 1960s struggle
for racial justice in the United States.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.856
But women were also
a critical driving force,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.960
mobilizing, organizing,
taking to the streets.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.336
How many of us think of Septima Clark

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.960
when we think of the United States
Civil Rights era?

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.280
Remarkably few.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.216
But she played a crucial role
in every phase of the struggle,

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.896
particularly by emphasizing
literacy and education.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.416
She's been omitted, ignored,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.136
like so many other women
who played critical roles

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.200
in the United States
Civil Rights Movement.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.000
This is not about getting credit.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.960
It's more profound than that.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.536
The stories we tell matter deeply
to how we see ourselves,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.256
and to how we believe movements are run

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.160
and how movements are won.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.816
The stories we tell about a movement
like the First Intifada

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.776
or the United States Civil Rights era

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.896
matter deeply
and have a critical influence

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.576
in the choices Palestinians,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.896
Americans

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.016
and people around the world will make

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.336
next time they encounter an injustice

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.640
and develop the courage to confront it.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.816
If we do not lift up the women who played
critical roles in these struggles,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.800
we fail to offer up role models
to future generations.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.256
Without role models, it becomes harder

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.296
for women to take up their rightful space

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.520
in public life.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.456
And as we saw earlier,

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.296
one of the most critical variables

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.496
in determining whether
a movement will be successful or not

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.536
is a movement's ideology
regarding the role of women

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.760
in public life.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.376
This is a question of whether we're moving

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.280
towards more democratic
and peaceful societies.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.736
In a world where so much
change is happening,

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.000
and where change is bound to continue
at an increasingly faster pace,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.600
it is not a question
of whether we will face conflict,

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.216
but rather a question

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.616
of which stories will shape

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.560
how we choose to wage conflict.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.016
Thank you.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.842
