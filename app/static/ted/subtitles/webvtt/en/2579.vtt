00:00:00.954 --> 00:00:03.880
I'm here today to talk about
the two ideas that,

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.262
at least based on
my observations at Khan Academy,

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:10.164
are kind of the core,
or the key leverage points for learning.

00:00:10.188 --> 00:00:12.204
And it's the idea of mastery

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:14.013
and the idea of mindset.

00:00:14.037 --> 00:00:16.871
I saw this in the early days
working with my cousins.

00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:19.375
A lot of them were having trouble
with math at first,

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:22.453
because they had all of these gaps
accumulated in their learning.

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:25.466
And because of that, at some point
they got to an algebra class

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.892
and they might have been a little bit
shaky on some of the pre-algebra,

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:32.361
and because of that, they thought
they didn't have the math gene.

00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:34.048
Or they'd get to a calculus class,

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:36.834
and they'd be a little bit
shaky on the algebra.

00:00:36.858 --> 00:00:38.428
I saw it in the early days

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:41.980
when I was uploading
some of those videos on YouTube,

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:45.281
and I realized that people
who were not my cousins were watching.

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:47.170
(Laughter)

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:51.060
And at first, those comments
were just simple thank-yous.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.053
I thought that was a pretty big deal.

00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:55.529
I don't know how much time
you all spend on YouTube.

00:00:55.553 --> 00:00:57.640
Most of the comments are not "Thank you."

00:00:57.664 --> 00:00:59.121
(Laughter)

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:00.783
They're a little edgier than that.

00:01:00.807 --> 00:01:03.238
But then the comments
got a little more intense,

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:07.718
student after student saying
that they had grown up not liking math.

00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:10.941
It was getting difficult as they got
into more advanced math topics.

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:12.493
By the time they got to algebra,

00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:15.845
they had so many gaps in their knowledge
they couldn't engage with it.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.942
They thought they didn't
have the math gene.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.446
But when they were a bit older,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.713
they took a little agency
and decided to engage.

00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:23.589
They found resources like Khan Academy

00:01:23.613 --> 00:01:26.763
and they were able to fill in those gaps
and master those concepts,

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:29.377
and that reinforced their mindset
that it wasn't fixed;

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.966
that they actually were capable
of learning mathematics.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.043
And in a lot of ways, this is how
you would master a lot of things in life.

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:39.366
It's the way you would
learn a martial art.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.556
In a martial art, you would
practice the white belt skills

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.993
as long as necessary,

00:01:44.017 --> 00:01:45.568
and only when you've mastered it

00:01:45.592 --> 00:01:47.727
you would move on to become a yellow belt.

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:49.822
It's the way you learn
a musical instrument:

00:01:49.846 --> 00:01:52.140
you practice the basic piece
over and over again,

00:01:52.164 --> 00:01:53.752
and only when you've mastered it,

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:55.447
you go on to the more advanced one.

00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:56.811
But what we point out --

00:01:56.835 --> 00:02:01.320
this is not the way a traditional
academic model is structured,

00:02:01.344 --> 00:02:04.679
the type of academic model
that most of us grew up in.

00:02:04.703 --> 00:02:06.245
In a traditional academic model,

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:08.688
we group students together,
usually by age,

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:09.991
and around middle school,

00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:11.861
by age and perceived ability,

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:14.443
and we shepherd them all
together at the same pace.

00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:16.335
And what typically happens,

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.860
let's say we're in a middle school
pre-algebra class,

00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:20.678
and the current unit is on exponents,

00:02:20.702 --> 00:02:22.892
the teacher will give
a lecture on exponents,

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:25.201
then we'll go home, do some homework.

00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:27.279
The next morning,
we'll review the homework,

00:02:27.303 --> 00:02:29.651
then another lecture, homework,
lecture, homework.

00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:31.936
That will continue for about
two or three weeks,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.135
and then we get a test.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.477
On that test, maybe I get a 75 percent,

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:37.918
maybe you get a 90 percent,

00:02:37.942 --> 00:02:39.926
maybe you get a 95 percent.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.697
And even though the test identified
gaps in our knowledge,

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:44.680
I didn't know 25 percent of the material.

00:02:44.704 --> 00:02:47.676
Even the A student, what was
the five percent they didn't know?

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.513
Even though we've identified the gaps,

00:02:49.537 --> 00:02:52.075
the whole class will then
move on to the next subject,

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.501
probably a more advanced subject
that's going to build on those gaps.

00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:58.898
It might be logarithms
or negative exponents.

00:02:58.922 --> 00:03:01.953
And that process continues,
and you immediately start to realize

00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:03.152
how strange this is.

00:03:03.176 --> 00:03:05.947
I didn't know 25 percent
of the more foundational thing,

00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:08.416
and now I'm being pushed
to the more advanced thing.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.152
And this will continue for months, years,
all the way until at some point,

00:03:12.176 --> 00:03:14.616
I might be in an algebra class
or trigonometry class

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.897
and I hit a wall.

00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:18.575
And it's not because algebra
is fundamentally difficult

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.591
or because the student isn't bright.

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:25.926
It's because I'm seeing an equation
and they're dealing with exponents

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.679
and that 30 percent
that I didn't know is showing up.

00:03:28.703 --> 00:03:31.532
And then I start to disengage.

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.895
To appreciate how absurd that is,

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.664
imagine if we did other things
in our life that way.

00:03:39.124 --> 00:03:40.578
Say, home-building.

00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:43.275
(Laughter)

00:03:44.878 --> 00:03:48.272
So we bring in the contractor and say,

00:03:48.296 --> 00:03:50.844
"We were told we have
two weeks to build a foundation.

00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:52.204
Do what you can."

00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:54.531
(Laughter)

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:56.777
So they do what they can.

00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:57.957
Maybe it rains.

00:03:57.981 --> 00:03:59.950
Maybe some of the supplies don't show up.

00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:03.284
And two weeks later,
the inspector comes, looks around,

00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:05.973
says, "OK, the concrete
is still wet right over there,

00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:07.849
that part's not quite up to code ...

00:04:08.838 --> 00:04:10.196
I'll give it an 80 percent."

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.284
(Laughter)

00:04:11.308 --> 00:04:14.043
You say, "Great! That's a C.
Let's build the first floor."

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:15.085
(Laughter)

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.263
Same thing.

00:04:16.287 --> 00:04:20.126
We have two weeks, do what you can,
inspector shows up, it's a 75 percent.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.309
Great, that's a D-plus.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:22.579
Second floor, third floor,

00:04:22.603 --> 00:04:25.381
and all of a sudden,
while you're building the third floor,

00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:26.841
the whole structure collapses.

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:30.109
And if your reaction is the reaction
you typically have in education,

00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:31.474
or that a lot of folks have,

00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:33.604
you might say, maybe
we had a bad contractor,

00:04:33.628 --> 00:04:36.721
or maybe we needed better inspection
or more frequent inspection.

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:38.994
But what was really broken
was the process.

00:04:39.018 --> 00:04:42.047
We were artificially constraining
how long we had to something,

00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:44.444
pretty much ensuring a variable outcome,

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:47.992
and we took the trouble of inspecting
and identifying those gaps,

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:49.949
but then we built right on top of it.

00:04:49.973 --> 00:04:52.910
So the idea of mastery learning
is to do the exact opposite.

00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:55.402
Instead of artificially
constraining, fixing

00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:57.414
when and how long you work on something,

00:04:57.438 --> 00:04:59.656
pretty much ensuring
that variable outcome,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.353
the A, B, C, D, F --

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.464
do it the other way around.

00:05:03.844 --> 00:05:05.636
What's variable is when and how long

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.754
a student actually has
to work on something,

00:05:07.778 --> 00:05:11.025
and what's fixed is that
they actually master the material.

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:13.096
And it's important to realize

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.485
that not only will this make the student
learn their exponents better,

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.467
but it'll reinforce
the right mindset muscles.

00:05:19.491 --> 00:05:22.919
It makes them realize that if you got
20 percent wrong on something,

00:05:22.943 --> 00:05:26.332
it doesn't mean that you have
a C branded in your DNA somehow.

00:05:26.356 --> 00:05:28.790
It means that you should just
keep working on it.

00:05:28.814 --> 00:05:31.306
You should have grit;
you should have perseverance;

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.471
you should take agency over your learning.

00:05:33.908 --> 00:05:36.898
Now, a lot of skeptics might say,
well, hey, this is all great,

00:05:36.922 --> 00:05:39.643
philosophically, this whole idea
of mastery-based learning

00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:41.103
and its connection to mindset,

00:05:41.127 --> 00:05:43.226
students taking agency
over their learning.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.385
It makes a lot of sense,
but it seems impractical.

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:49.806
To actually do it, every student
would be on their own track.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.454
It would have to be personalized,

00:05:51.478 --> 00:05:54.660
you'd have to have private tutors
and worksheets for every student.

00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:56.183
And these aren't new ideas --

00:05:56.207 --> 00:05:59.033
there were experiments
in Winnetka, Illinois, 100 years ago,

00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:01.875
where they did mastery-based learning
and saw great results,

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:05.196
but they said it wouldn't scale
because it was logistically difficult.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.127
The teacher had to give different
worksheets to every student,

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:09.439
give on-demand assessments.

00:06:09.463 --> 00:06:11.724
But now today, it's no longer impractical.

00:06:11.748 --> 00:06:13.114
We have the tools to do it.

00:06:13.138 --> 00:06:15.733
Students see an explanation
at their own time and pace?

00:06:15.757 --> 00:06:17.352
There's on-demand video for that.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:19.448
They need practice? They need feedback?

00:06:19.472 --> 00:06:23.912
There's adaptive exercises
readily available for students.

00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:26.905
And when that happens,
all sorts of neat things happen.

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:29.702
One, the students can actually
master the concepts,

00:06:29.726 --> 00:06:31.921
but they're also building
their growth mindset,

00:06:31.945 --> 00:06:33.742
they're building grit, perseverance,

00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:35.789
they're taking agency over their learning.

00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:38.370
And all sorts of beautiful things
can start to happen

00:06:38.394 --> 00:06:40.030
in the actual classroom.

00:06:40.054 --> 00:06:42.112
Instead of it being focused
on the lecture,

00:06:42.136 --> 00:06:43.954
students can interact with each other.

00:06:43.978 --> 00:06:46.136
They can get deeper mastery
over the material.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.513
They can go into simulations,
Socratic dialogue.

00:06:48.537 --> 00:06:51.216
To appreciate what we're talking about

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.287
and the tragedy of lost potential here,

00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:58.454
I'd like to give a little bit
of a thought experiment.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:04.051
If we were to go 400 years
into the past to Western Europe,

00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:07.239
which even then, was one of the more
literate parts of the planet,

00:07:07.263 --> 00:07:10.990
you would see that about 15 percent
of the population knew how to read.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:15.194
And I suspect that if you asked someone
who did know how to read,

00:07:15.218 --> 00:07:17.114
say a member of the clergy,

00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:20.750
"What percentage of the population
do you think is even capable of reading?"

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:24.335
They might say, "Well,
with a great education system,

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:26.603
maybe 20 or 30 percent."

00:07:27.424 --> 00:07:29.011
But if you fast forward to today,

00:07:29.035 --> 00:07:32.050
we know that that prediction
would have been wildly pessimistic,

00:07:32.074 --> 00:07:36.199
that pretty close to 100 percent
of the population is capable of reading.

00:07:36.223 --> 00:07:38.774
But if I were to ask you
a similar question:

00:07:39.494 --> 00:07:43.033
"What percentage of the population
do you think is capable

00:07:43.057 --> 00:07:45.930
of truly mastering calculus,

00:07:45.954 --> 00:07:48.967
or understanding organic chemistry,

00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:52.277
or being able to contribute
to cancer research?"

00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:55.198
A lot of you might say, "Well,
with a great education system,

00:07:55.222 --> 00:07:57.244
maybe 20, 30 percent."

00:07:57.778 --> 00:07:59.091
But what if that estimate

00:07:59.115 --> 00:08:02.502
is just based on your own experience
in a non-mastery framework,

00:08:02.526 --> 00:08:05.358
your own experience with yourself
or observing your peers,

00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:08.171
where you're being pushed
at this set pace through classes,

00:08:08.195 --> 00:08:09.534
accumulating all these gaps?

00:08:09.558 --> 00:08:11.199
Even when you got that 95 percent,

00:08:11.223 --> 00:08:13.035
what was that five percent you missed?

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:15.786
And it keeps accumulating --
you get to an advanced class,

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.682
all of a sudden you hit a wall and say,

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.709
"I'm not meant to be a cancer researcher;

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:22.661
not meant to be a physicist;
not meant to be a mathematician."

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:24.662
I suspect that that actually is the case,

00:08:24.686 --> 00:08:28.512
but if you were allowed to be operating
in a mastery framework,

00:08:28.536 --> 00:08:31.953
if you were allowed to really
take agency over your learning,

00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:33.573
and when you get something wrong,

00:08:33.597 --> 00:08:36.389
embrace it -- view that failure
as a moment of learning --

00:08:36.413 --> 00:08:40.370
that number, the percent
that could really master calculus

00:08:40.394 --> 00:08:42.154
or understand organic chemistry,

00:08:42.178 --> 00:08:44.680
is actually a lot closer to 100 percent.

00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:48.458
And this isn't even just a "nice to have."

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:51.082
I think it's a social imperative.

00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:55.362
We're exiting what you could call
the industrial age

00:08:55.386 --> 00:08:59.190
and we're going into
this information revolution.

00:08:59.646 --> 00:09:01.820
And it's clear that some
things are happening.

00:09:01.844 --> 00:09:03.957
In the industrial age,
society was a pyramid.

00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:08.633
At the base of the pyramid,
you needed human labor.

00:09:09.085 --> 00:09:12.418
In the middle of the pyramid,
you had an information processing,

00:09:12.442 --> 00:09:14.040
a bureaucracy class,

00:09:14.064 --> 00:09:17.738
and at the top of the pyramid,
you had your owners of capital

00:09:17.762 --> 00:09:19.761
and your entrepreneurs

00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:21.237
and your creative class.

00:09:21.904 --> 00:09:23.700
But we know what's happening already,

00:09:23.724 --> 00:09:25.739
as we go into this information revolution.

00:09:25.763 --> 00:09:28.716
The bottom of that pyramid,
automation, is going to take over.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.065
Even that middle tier,
information processing,

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:32.715
that's what computers are good at.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.486
So as a society, we have a question:

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.628
All this new productivity is happening
because of this technology,

00:09:37.652 --> 00:09:38.982
but who participates in it?

00:09:39.006 --> 00:09:42.201
Is it just going to be that very top
of the pyramid, in which case,

00:09:42.225 --> 00:09:43.566
what does everyone else do?

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.756
How do they operate?

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.200
Or do we do something
that's more aspirational?

00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:50.691
Do we actually attempt
to invert the pyramid,

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.716
where you have a large creative class,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.421
where almost everyone
can participate as an entrepreneur,

00:09:56.445 --> 00:09:58.390
an artist, as a researcher?

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.780
And I don't think that this is utopian.

00:10:00.804 --> 00:10:03.168
I really think that this
is all based on the idea

00:10:03.192 --> 00:10:05.376
that if we let people
tap into their potential

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.364
by mastering concepts,

00:10:07.388 --> 00:10:10.965
by being able to exercise agency
over their learning,

00:10:10.989 --> 00:10:12.331
that they can get there.

00:10:12.672 --> 00:10:16.672
And when you think of it
as just a citizen of the world,

00:10:16.696 --> 00:10:17.959
it's pretty exciting.

00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:20.611
I mean, think about
the type of equity we can we have,

00:10:20.635 --> 00:10:23.839
and the rate at which civilization
could even progress.

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:26.552
And so, I'm pretty optimistic about it.

00:10:26.576 --> 00:10:30.139
I think it's going to be
a pretty exciting time to be alive.

00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:31.329
Thank you.

00:10:31.353 --> 00:10:36.830
(Applause)
