00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We all know the Earth is in trouble.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We have now entered in the 6X,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the sixth major extinction on this planet.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
otherwise known as "Uh-Oh" --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
(Laughter) -- and every organism had a right to vote,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I think that vote is occurring right now.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
using fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The mycelium infuses all landscapes,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
it holds soils together, it's extremely tenacious.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This holds up to 30,000 times its mass.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
so the mycelium is the mother

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Dusty and I, we like to say, on Sunday, this is where we go to church.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm in love with the old-growth forest,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and I'm a patriotic American because we have those.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And frankly, I face a big obstacle.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
When I mention mushrooms to somebody,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
their eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We call it mycophobia,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Mushrooms are very fast in their growth.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Day 21, day 23, day 25.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
In fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
A group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We share in common the same pathogens.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and so our best antibiotics come from fungi.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But here is a mushroom that's past its prime.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
After they sporulate, they do rot.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that occur on rotting mushrooms

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
are essential for the health of the forest.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
They give rise to the trees,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And so we see a mushroom here sporulating.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And the spores are germinating,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and the mycelium forms and goes underground.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
In a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And notice that as the mycelium grows,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
it conquers territory and then it begins the net.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I have thousands of electron micrographs,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and when I'm staring at the mycelium,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I realize that they are microfiltration membranes.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It inhales oxygen, just like we do.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And in these cavities, these micro-cavities form,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and as they fuse soils, they absorb water.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
These are little wells.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
but sets up a microbial universe

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I first proposed, in the early 1990s,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that mycelium is Earth's natural Internet.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
When you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
because of the nodes of crossing --

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Internet engineers maybe call them hot points --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The mycelium is sentient.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It knows that you are there.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
When you walk across landscapes,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So, I believe the invention of the computer Internet

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is an inevitable consequence

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
of a previously proven, biologically successful model.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and we now, being the top organism on this planet,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Going way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I believe matter begets life;

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
life becomes single cells; single cells become strings;

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
strings become chains; chains network.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
They came to land 1.3 billion years ago,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and plants followed several hundred million years later.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
How is that possible?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
It's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and many other acids and enzymes,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and forming calcium oxalates.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Makes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So, fungi and mycelium

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And all sorts of other oxalates

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
This was first discovered in 1859.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
This is a photograph by Franz Hueber.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
This photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
420 million years ago, this organism existed.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
It was called Prototaxites.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Prototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Dr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
published an article in the Journal of Geology

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
a giant mushroom.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
All across most land masses.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And these existed for tens of millions of years.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Now, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
65 million years ago -- most of you know about it --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
we had an asteroid impact.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
The Earth was struck by an asteroid,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Sunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
because fungi do not need light.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
More recently, at Einstein University,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
much like plants use light.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I think, is a forgone conclusion,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
at least in my own mind.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size:

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
How is it that this organism can be so large,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and yet be one cell wall thick,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
The mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
We were involved with several experiments.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I'm going to show you six, if I can,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
solutions for helping to save the world.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste:

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
one was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes;

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
one pile was treated with bacteria;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
The mycelium absorbs the oil.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
The mycelium is producing enzymes --

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and then, when we returned six weeks later,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
all the tarps were removed,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
all the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
We came back to our pile, it was covered

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and the color changed to a light form.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
They're very large.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
They're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
But something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
They sporulated, the spores attract insects,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
the insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Birds then came, bringing in seeds,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and our pile became an oasis of life.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Whereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and the PAH's -- the aromatic hydrocarbons --

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
The last image we don't have.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
The entire pile was a green berm of life.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
These are gateway species,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
from a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
or a factory with chemical toxins,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and it leads to habitat restoration.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And I'll show you a graph here.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
This is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and 10 to the third power is around 1,000.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
In 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Think of the implications.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
This is my wife Dusty,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis -- Agarikon.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
It's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
that Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
as a treatment against consumption.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
This mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
northern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
May not seem that large --

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
let's get closer.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
This is extremely rare fungus.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Our team -- and we have a team of experts that go out --

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
We found one sample to be able to get into culture.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I think is absolutely critical for human health.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And a few years ago,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
we received these results.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that were highly active against poxviruses.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Dr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
of the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that have a selectivity index of two or more are active.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
10 or greater are considered to be very active.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
There's a vetted press release that you can read --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
it's vetted by DOD --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
if you Google "Stamets" and "smallpox."

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So, encouraged by this, naturally we went to flu viruses.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And so, for the first time, I am showing this.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
highly active against flu viruses.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Here's the selectivity index numbers --

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
against pox, you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
compared to the ribavirin controls,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
we have an extraordinarily high activity.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And we're using a natural extract

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
We tried it against flu A viruses -- H1N1, H3N2 --

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
as well as flu B viruses.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
So then we tried a blend,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
(Applause)

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I then think that we can make the argument

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
that we should save the old-growth forest

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
as a matter of national defense.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
(Applause)

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi --

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
fungi that kill insects.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
with metarhizium species of a group of fungi

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
that kill carpenter ants, as well as termites.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I did something that nobody else had done.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
These are spores -- this is in their spores.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I was able to morph the culture

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
into a non-sporulating form.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But the insects aren't stupid,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and they would avoid the spores when they came close,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
were making debris fields, every day,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
in my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
because there's no spores.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
They gave it to the queen.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
One week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death --

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
the mycelium is consumed by the ants,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
they become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
(Laughter)

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Now after sporulation, the spores repel.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So, you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And so my house came down, I received my first patent

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
against carpenter ants, termites and fire ants.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Then we tried extracts, and lo and behold,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
we can steer insects to different directions.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
This has huge implications.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
It covers over 200,000 species.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
This is the most disruptive technology --

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I've been told by executives of the pesticide industry --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
that they have ever witnessed.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
You could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
prior to sporulation, attract the very insects

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
that are otherwise repelled by those spores.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference --

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
you add soil, you add water,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
like of the Agarikon mushroom.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And then you put tree seeds in here,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and then you end up growing -- potentially --

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
an old-growth forest from a cardboard box.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
I want to reinvent the delivery system,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and the use of cardboard around the world,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
so they become ecological footprints.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
If there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
you could make it interactive, zip code specific --

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
where people could join together,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and through satellite imaging systems,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
through Virtual Earth or Google Earth,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
you could add water -- I developed this for the refugee community --

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
corns, beans and squash and onions.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I took several containers -- my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and I ended up growing a seed garden.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Then you harvest the seeds --

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this --

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and then you're harvesting the seed garden.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Then you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I add mycelium to it, and then I inoculate the corncobs.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Now, three corncobs, no other grain --

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
lots of mushrooms begin to form.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and so this population will be shut down.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
But watch what happens here.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
The mushrooms then are harvested,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
but very importantly,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And we came up with Econol.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary --

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
about the generation of fuels.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
So, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
These are a species that we need to join with.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
I think engaging mycelium can help save the world.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
(Applause)
