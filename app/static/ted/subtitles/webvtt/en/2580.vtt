WEBVTT

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.091
I'm a journalist,

00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:04.666
so I like to look for the untold stories,

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.396
the lives that quietly play out
under the scream of headlines.

00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:12.434
I've also been going about the business
of putting down roots,

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:14.762
choosing a partner, making babies.

00:00:15.206 --> 00:00:17.437
So for the last few years,

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:18.924
I've been trying to understand

00:00:18.948 --> 00:00:22.396
what constitutes
the 21st-century good life,

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:27.695
both because I'm fascinated by the moral
and philosophical implications,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.799
but also because I'm in desperate
need of answers myself.

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:33.933
We live in tenuous times.

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:37.587
In fact, for the first time
in American history,

00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:41.731
the majority of parents do not think
that their kids will be better off

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:43.187
than they were.

00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:46.489
This is true of rich and poor,
men and women.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.565
Now, some of you
might hear this and feel sad.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.581
After all, America is deeply invested

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:55.484
in this idea of economic transcendence,

00:00:55.508 --> 00:00:59.068
that every generation kind of
leapfrogs the one before it,

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.790
earning more, buying more, being more.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.457
We've exported this dream
all over the world,

00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:08.390
so kids in Brazil and China and even Kenya

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:10.783
inherit our insatiable expectation

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.354
for more.

00:01:13.063 --> 00:01:16.120
But when I read this historic poll
for the first time,

00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:18.117
it didn't actually make me feel sad.

00:01:18.593 --> 00:01:20.339
It felt like a provocation.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.014
"Better off" -- based on whose standards?

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.113
Is "better off" finding a secure job

00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:29.628
that you can count on
for the rest of your life?

00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:31.764
Those are nearly extinct.

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:35.785
People move jobs, on average,
every 4.7 years,

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:37.770
and it's estimated that by 2020,

00:01:37.794 --> 00:01:40.650
nearly half of Americans
will be freelancers.

00:01:41.523 --> 00:01:44.474
OK, so is better off just a number?

00:01:44.498 --> 00:01:47.465
Is it about earning
as much as you possibly can?

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.292
By that singular measurement,
we are failing.

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:55.513
Median per capita income
has been flat since about 2000,

00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:57.099
adjusted for inflation.

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.234
All right, so is better off getting
a big house with a white picket fence?

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.147
Less of us are doing that.

00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:08.374
Nearly five million people lost
their homes in the Great Recession,

00:02:08.398 --> 00:02:12.772
and even more of us sobered up
about the lengths we were willing to go --

00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:15.543
or be tricked into going,
in many predatory cases --

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:17.074
to hold that deed.

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:21.258
Home-ownership rates
are at their lowest since 1995.

00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:25.465
All right, so we're not
finding steady employment,

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.222
we're not earning as much money,

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.658
and we're not living in big fancy houses.

00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:32.087
Toll the funeral bells

00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:34.680
for everything that made America great.

00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:37.299
But,

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:41.673
are those the best measurements
of a country's greatness,

00:02:41.697 --> 00:02:43.198
of a life well lived?

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.455
What I think makes America great
is its spirit of reinvention.

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.752
In the wake of the Great Recession,

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:53.933
more and more Americans are redefining
what "better off" really means.

00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:58.398
Turns out, it has more to do
with community and creativity

00:02:58.422 --> 00:03:00.107
than dollars and cents.

00:03:00.917 --> 00:03:02.956
Now, let me be very clear:

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.673
the 14.8 percent of Americans
living in poverty need money,

00:03:08.697 --> 00:03:10.077
plain and simple.

00:03:10.101 --> 00:03:13.762
And all of us need policies
that protect us from exploitation

00:03:13.786 --> 00:03:16.987
by employers and financial institutions.

00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:21.662
Nothing that follows is meant to suggest
that the gap between rich and poor

00:03:21.686 --> 00:03:25.057
is anything but profoundly immoral.

00:03:26.224 --> 00:03:27.529
But,

00:03:27.553 --> 00:03:30.192
too often we let
the conversation stop there.

00:03:30.804 --> 00:03:34.529
We talk about poverty as if
it were a monolithic experience;

00:03:34.553 --> 00:03:37.300
about the poor as if
they were solely victims.

00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:40.983
Part of what I've learned
in my research and reporting

00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:43.413
is that the art of living well

00:03:43.437 --> 00:03:46.425
is often practiced most masterfully

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.555
by the most vulnerable.

00:03:50.253 --> 00:03:52.745
Now, if necessity
is the mother of invention,

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.467
I've come to believe

00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:58.308
that recession can be
the father of consciousness.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.717
It confronts us with profound questions,

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.884
questions we might be too lazy
or distracted to ask

00:04:04.908 --> 00:04:06.581
in times of relative comfort.

00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:08.610
How should we work?

00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:09.947
How should we live?

00:04:10.766 --> 00:04:13.005
All of us, whether we realize it or not,

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:14.601
seek answers to these questions,

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:17.790
with our ancestors
kind of whispering in our ears.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.143
My great-grandfather
was a drunk in Detroit,

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:25.730
who sometimes managed
to hold down a factory job.

00:04:26.611 --> 00:04:29.527
He had, as unbelievable as it might sound,

00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:31.422
21 children,

00:04:31.446 --> 00:04:33.828
with one woman, my great-grandmother,

00:04:33.852 --> 00:04:37.252
who died at 47 years old
of ovarian cancer.

00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:39.880
Now, I'm pregnant with my second child,

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:44.478
and I cannot even fathom
what she must have gone through.

00:04:44.502 --> 00:04:48.088
And if you're trying to do the math --
there were six sets of twins.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.548
So my grandfather, their son,

00:04:51.572 --> 00:04:53.271
became a traveling salesman,

00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:54.790
and he lived boom and bust.

00:04:54.814 --> 00:04:58.500
So my dad grew up answering
the door for debt collectors

00:04:58.524 --> 00:05:00.519
and pretending his parents weren't home.

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.159
He actually took his braces off himself
with pliers in the garage,

00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:07.342
when his father admitted
he didn't have money

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:09.040
to go back to the orthodontist.

00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:12.549
So my dad, unsurprisingly,

00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:14.641
became a bankruptcy lawyer.

00:05:14.665 --> 00:05:16.713
Couldn't write this in a novel, right?

00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:20.517
He was obsessed with providing
a secure foundation

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:21.887
for my brother and I.

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:26.268
So I ask these questions
by way of a few generations of struggle.

00:05:26.895 --> 00:05:29.952
My parents made sure that I grew up
on a kind of steady ground

00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:33.293
that allows one to question
and risk and leap.

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.223
And ironically, and probably
sometimes to their frustration,

00:05:37.247 --> 00:05:40.531
it is their steadfast
commitment to security

00:05:40.555 --> 00:05:43.020
that allows me to question its value,

00:05:43.044 --> 00:05:46.022
or at least its value
as we've historically defined it

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:47.759
in the 21st century.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.854
So let's dig into this first question:

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.048
How should we work?

00:05:54.397 --> 00:05:57.008
We should work like our mothers.

00:05:57.754 --> 00:05:59.893
That's right -- we've spent decades

00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:03.947
trying to fit women into a work world
built for company men.

00:06:04.358 --> 00:06:06.248
And many have done backbends to fit in,

00:06:06.272 --> 00:06:08.897
but others have carved
a more unconventional path,

00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:11.851
creating a patchwork of meaning and money

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:14.596
with enough flexibility
to do what they need to do

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.286
for those that they love.

00:06:16.993 --> 00:06:19.159
My mom called it "just making it work."

00:06:19.574 --> 00:06:23.043
Today I hear life coaches
call it "a portfolio career."

00:06:23.956 --> 00:06:25.615
Whatever you call it,

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.708
more and more men are craving
these whole, if not harried, lives.

00:06:31.332 --> 00:06:35.690
They're waking up to their desire
and duty to be present fathers and sons.

00:06:36.547 --> 00:06:38.984
Now, artist Ann Hamilton has said,

00:06:39.008 --> 00:06:41.523
"Labor is a way of knowing."

00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:43.746
Labor is a way of knowing.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.778
In other words, what we work on

00:06:45.802 --> 00:06:48.305
is what we understand about the world.

00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:51.242
If this is true, and I think it is,

00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:54.838
then women who have disproportionately
cared for the little ones

00:06:54.862 --> 00:06:56.839
and the sick ones and the aging ones,

00:06:56.863 --> 00:06:59.795
have disproportionately benefited

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.349
from the most profound kind
of knowing there is:

00:07:03.373 --> 00:07:05.518
knowing the human condition.

00:07:06.442 --> 00:07:08.594
By prioritizing care,

00:07:08.618 --> 00:07:11.194
men are, in a sense, staking their claim

00:07:11.218 --> 00:07:14.121
to the full range of human existence.

00:07:15.097 --> 00:07:18.233
Now, this means the nine-to-five
no longer works for anyone.

00:07:18.685 --> 00:07:21.511
Punch clocks are becoming obsolete,
as are career ladders.

00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:24.603
Whole industries are being born
and dying every day.

00:07:24.627 --> 00:07:26.558
It's all nonlinear from here.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.102
So we need to stop asking kids,

00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:31.182
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:07:31.206 --> 00:07:34.510
and start asking them,
"How do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:07:35.247 --> 00:07:37.146
Their work will constantly change.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.145
The common denominator is them.

00:07:39.504 --> 00:07:41.445
So the more they understand their gifts

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:43.924
and create crews of ideal collaborators,

00:07:43.948 --> 00:07:45.788
the better off they will be.

00:07:46.717 --> 00:07:49.380
The challenge ahead is to reinvent
the social safety net

00:07:49.404 --> 00:07:52.341
to fit this increasingly
fragmented economy.

00:07:52.365 --> 00:07:54.224
We need portable health benefits.

00:07:54.248 --> 00:07:57.857
We need policies that reflect
that everyone deserves to be vulnerable

00:07:57.881 --> 00:07:59.379
or care for vulnerable others,

00:07:59.403 --> 00:08:01.011
without becoming destitute.

00:08:01.035 --> 00:08:03.683
We need to seriously consider
a universal basic income.

00:08:03.707 --> 00:08:05.904
We need to reinvent labor organizing.

00:08:06.682 --> 00:08:10.548
The promise of a work world
that is structured to actually fit

00:08:10.572 --> 00:08:12.472
our 21st century values,

00:08:12.496 --> 00:08:15.433
not some archaic idea
about bringing home the bacon,

00:08:15.457 --> 00:08:17.647
is long overdue --

00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:19.054
just ask your mother.

00:08:19.877 --> 00:08:21.579
Now, how about the second question:

00:08:21.603 --> 00:08:22.832
How should we live?

00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:25.483
We should live

00:08:25.507 --> 00:08:27.579
like our immigrant ancestors.

00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:30.611
When they came to America,

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:34.865
they often shared apartments,
survival tactics, child care --

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.895
always knew how to fill one more belly,

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.179
no matter how small the food available.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.336
But they were told that success meant
leaving the village behind

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.412
and pursuing that iconic symbol
of the American Dream,

00:08:46.436 --> 00:08:47.912
the white picket fence.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.484
And even today,
we see a white picket fence

00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:52.881
and we think success, self-possession.

00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:55.136
But when you strip away
the sentimentality,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.536
what it really does is divides us.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.713
Many Americans are rejecting
the white picket fence

00:09:00.737 --> 00:09:04.052
and the kind of highly privatized life
that happened within it,

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.866
and reclaiming village life,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.470
reclaiming interdependence instead.

00:09:09.311 --> 00:09:10.914
Fifty million of us, for example,

00:09:10.938 --> 00:09:13.613
live in intergenerational households.

00:09:14.018 --> 00:09:16.746
This number exploded
with the Great Recession,

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.408
but it turns out people
actually like living this way.

00:09:19.432 --> 00:09:23.280
Two-thirds of those who are living
with multiple generations under one roof

00:09:23.304 --> 00:09:25.673
say it's improved their relationships.

00:09:26.145 --> 00:09:28.969
Some people are choosing
to share homes not with family,

00:09:28.993 --> 00:09:32.353
but with other people who understand
the health and economic benefits

00:09:32.377 --> 00:09:34.058
of daily community.

00:09:34.082 --> 00:09:37.716
CoAbode, an online platform
for single moms looking to share homes

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.103
with other single moms,

00:09:39.127 --> 00:09:41.118
has 50,000 users.

00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:44.398
And people over 65 are especially prone

00:09:44.422 --> 00:09:47.571
to be looking for these alternative
living arrangements.

00:09:48.074 --> 00:09:50.573
They understand that their quality of life

00:09:50.597 --> 00:09:54.846
depends on a mix
of solitude and solidarity.

00:09:55.727 --> 00:09:58.220
Which is true of all of us
when you think about it,

00:09:58.244 --> 00:09:59.608
young and old alike.

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:03.663
For too long, we've pretended
that happiness is a king in his castle.

00:10:04.306 --> 00:10:06.477
But all the research proves otherwise.

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:10.009
It shows that the healthiest,
happiest and even safest --

00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:16.107
in terms of both climate change disaster,
in terms of crime, all of that --

00:10:16.131 --> 00:10:19.963
are Americans who live lives
intertwined with their neighbors.

00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:22.558
Now, I've experienced this firsthand.

00:10:23.076 --> 00:10:26.268
For the last few years, I've been living
in a cohousing community.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:29.901
It's 1.5 acres of persimmon trees,

00:10:29.925 --> 00:10:33.677
this prolific blackberry bush
that snakes around a community garden,

00:10:33.701 --> 00:10:36.914
all smack-dab, by the way,
in the middle of urban Oakland.

00:10:37.447 --> 00:10:39.566
The nine units are all built
to be different,

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.239
different sizes, different shapes,

00:10:41.263 --> 00:10:43.377
but they're meant to be
as green as possible.

00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:45.544
So big, shiny black
solar cells on our roof

00:10:45.568 --> 00:10:47.502
mean our electricity bill rarely exceeds

00:10:47.526 --> 00:10:49.144
more than five bucks in a month.

00:10:49.787 --> 00:10:53.598
The 25 of us who live there are all
different ages and political persuasions

00:10:53.622 --> 00:10:54.780
and professions,

00:10:54.804 --> 00:10:58.082
and we live in homes that have everything
a typical home would have.

00:10:58.106 --> 00:10:59.260
But additionally,

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.800
we share an industrial-sized
kitchen and eating area,

00:11:01.824 --> 00:11:03.889
where we have common meals twice a week.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.152
Now, people, when I tell them
I live like this,

00:11:06.176 --> 00:11:08.082
often have one of two extreme reactions.

00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:10.755
Either they say, "Why doesn't
everyone live like this?"

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:13.507
Or they say, "That sounds
totally horrifying.

00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:15.030
I would never want to do that."

00:11:15.054 --> 00:11:20.201
So let me reassure you: there is
a sacred respect for privacy among us,

00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:24.931
but also a commitment to what we call
"radical hospitality" --

00:11:25.535 --> 00:11:27.958
not the kind advertised
by the Four Seasons,

00:11:28.704 --> 00:11:34.331
but the kind that says that every
single person is worthy of kindness,

00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:36.113
full stop, end of sentence.

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:40.606
The biggest surprise for me
of living in a community like this?

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:45.086
You share all the domestic labor --
the repairing, the cooking, the weeding --

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.173
but you also share the emotional labor.

00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:50.596
Rather than depending only
on the idealized family unit

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.488
to get all of your emotional needs met,

00:11:52.512 --> 00:11:54.921
you have two dozen other people
that you can go to

00:11:54.945 --> 00:11:56.781
to talk about a hard day at work

00:11:56.805 --> 00:11:59.490
or troubleshoot how to handle
an abusive teacher.

00:12:00.038 --> 00:12:05.602
Teenagers in our community will often go
to an adult that is not their parent

00:12:05.626 --> 00:12:06.885
to ask for advice.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.829
It's what bell hooks
called "revolutionary parenting,"

00:12:10.853 --> 00:12:12.651
this humble acknowledgment

00:12:12.675 --> 00:12:15.771
that kids are healthier when they have
a wider range of adults

00:12:15.795 --> 00:12:17.635
to emulate and count on.

00:12:18.451 --> 00:12:21.052
Turns out, adults are healthier, too.

00:12:21.568 --> 00:12:23.156
It's a lot of pressure,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.084
trying to be that perfect family
behind that white picket fence.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.634
The "new better off,"
as I've come to call it,

00:12:30.658 --> 00:12:33.614
is less about investing
in the perfect family

00:12:33.638 --> 00:12:37.123
and more about investing
in the imperfect village,

00:12:37.147 --> 00:12:39.373
whether that's relatives
living under one roof,

00:12:39.397 --> 00:12:41.237
a cohousing community like mine,

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.191
or just a bunch of neighbors
who pledge to really know

00:12:44.215 --> 00:12:45.721
and look out for one another.

00:12:46.134 --> 00:12:48.003
It's good common sense, right?

00:12:48.466 --> 00:12:51.273
And yet, money has often made us dumb

00:12:51.297 --> 00:12:52.662
about reaching out.

00:12:53.575 --> 00:12:55.608
The most reliable wealth

00:12:55.632 --> 00:12:58.191
is found in relationship.

00:12:59.511 --> 00:13:02.731
The new better off is not
an individual prospect at all.

00:13:03.384 --> 00:13:06.453
In fact, if you're a failure
or you think you're a failure,

00:13:06.477 --> 00:13:08.088
I've got some good news for you:

00:13:08.112 --> 00:13:11.902
you might be a success by standards
you have not yet honored.

00:13:12.404 --> 00:13:15.810
Maybe you're a mediocre earner
but a masterful father.

00:13:16.477 --> 00:13:18.359
Maybe you can't afford your dream home,

00:13:18.383 --> 00:13:21.089
but you throw legendary
neighborhood parties.

00:13:22.462 --> 00:13:24.226
If you're a textbook success,

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.741
the implications of what I'm saying
could be more grim for you.

00:13:28.344 --> 00:13:31.685
You might be a failure
by standards you hold dear

00:13:31.709 --> 00:13:34.111
but that the world doesn't reward.

00:13:34.719 --> 00:13:36.119
Only you can know.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.526
I know that I am not a tribute

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.036
to my great-grandmother,

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.729
who lived such a short and brutish life,

00:13:44.753 --> 00:13:47.916
if I earn enough money to afford
every creature comfort.

00:13:48.614 --> 00:13:51.743
You can't buy your way
out of suffering or into meaning.

00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:53.501
There is no home big enough

00:13:53.525 --> 00:13:56.547
to erase the pain
that she must have endured.

00:13:57.435 --> 00:13:58.685
I am a tribute to her

00:13:58.709 --> 00:14:03.156
if I live a life as connected
and courageous as possible.

00:14:04.256 --> 00:14:07.257
In the midst of such
widespread uncertainty,

00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:09.494
we may, in fact, be insecure.

00:14:10.334 --> 00:14:12.860
But we can let that insecurity
make us brittle

00:14:13.216 --> 00:14:14.375
or supple.

00:14:14.859 --> 00:14:19.866
We can turn inward, lose faith
in the power of institutions to change --

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.804
even lose faith in ourselves.

00:14:22.332 --> 00:14:23.736
Or we can turn outward,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:29.385
cultivate faith in our ability
to reach out, to connect, to create.

00:14:31.063 --> 00:14:33.457
Turns out, the biggest danger

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.878
is not failing to achieve
the American Dream.

00:14:37.624 --> 00:14:40.062
The biggest danger is achieving a dream

00:14:40.086 --> 00:14:42.449
that you don't actually believe in.

00:14:43.362 --> 00:14:44.592
So don't do that.

00:14:45.046 --> 00:14:47.688
Do the harder, more interesting thing,

00:14:47.712 --> 00:14:51.760
which is to compose a life
where what you do every single day,

00:14:51.784 --> 00:14:55.462
the people you give your best love
and ingenuity and energy to,

00:14:55.486 --> 00:14:58.496
aligns as closely as possible
with what you believe.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.415
That, not something as mundane
as making money,

00:15:02.439 --> 00:15:04.408
is a tribute to your ancestors.

00:15:04.432 --> 00:15:08.043
That is the beautiful struggle.

00:15:08.861 --> 00:15:10.052
Thank you.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:19.255
(Applause)
