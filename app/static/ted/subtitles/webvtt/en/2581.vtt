00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.096
The word concussion evokes a fear
these days more so than it ever has,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.496
and I know this personally.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.176
I played 10 years of football,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.616
was struck in the head thousands of times.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.296
And I have to tell you, though,
what was much worse than that

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.096
was a pair of bike accidents I had
where I suffered concussions,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.056
and I'm still dealing with the effects
of the most recent one

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.840
today as I stand in front of you.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.096
There is a fear around concussion

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.080
that does have some evidence behind it.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.936
There is information
that a repeated history of concussion

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.256
can lead to early dementia,
such as Alzheimer's,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.336
and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.400
That was the subject
of the Will Smith movie "Concussion."

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.136
And so everybody is caught up in football
and what they see in the military,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.496
but you may not know

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.816
that bike riding is the leading cause
of concussion for kids,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.507
sports-related concussion, that is.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.616
And so another thing
that I should tell you

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.856
that you may not know

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.816
is that the helmets that are worn
in bicycling and football

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.496
and many activities,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.096
they're not designed or tested

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.600
for how well they can protect
your children against concussion.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.936
They're in fact designed and tested

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.640
for their ability to protect
against skull fracture.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.456
And so I get this question
all the time from parents,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.056
and they ask me,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.376
"Would you let your own child
play football?"

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.576
Or, "Should I let my child play soccer?"

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.496
And I think that as a field,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.920
we're a long way from giving an answer
with any kind of confidence there.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.016
So I look at that question
from a bit of a different lens,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.776
and I want to know,
how can we prevent concussion?

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.456
Is that even possible?

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.040
And most experts think that it's not,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.736
but the work that we're doing in my lab

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.136
is starting to reveal more
of the details around concussion

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.936
so that we can have
a better understanding.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.816
The reason we're able
to prevent skull fracture with helmets

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.295
is because it's pretty simple.
We know how it works.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.360
Concussion has been
much more of a mystery.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.040
So to give you a sense of what might
be happening in a concussion,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.176
I want to show you the video here

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.736
that you see when you type into Google,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.176
"What is a concussion?"

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.856
The CDC website comes up,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.336
and this video essentially
tells the whole story.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.776
What you see is the head moves forward,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.856
the brain lags behind,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.296
then the brain catches up

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.576
and smashes into the skull.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.776
It rebounds off the skull

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.560
and then proceeds to run
into the other side of the skull.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.936
And what you'll notice is highlighted
in this video from the CDC,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.416
which I'll note was funded by the NFL,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.376
is that the outer surface of the brain,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.696
where it was to have
smashed into the skull,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.656
looks like it's been damaged or injured,
so it's on the outer surface of the brain.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.656
And what I'd like to do with this video

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.376
is to tell you that there are
some aspects that are probably right,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.416
indicative of what the scientists
think happens with concussion,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.056
but there's probably more
that's wrong with this video.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.336
So one thing that I do agree with,
and I think most experts would,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.376
is that the brain
does have these dynamics.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.776
It does lag behind the skull

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.456
and then catch up and move
back and forth and oscillate.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.720
That we think is true.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.056
However, the amount of motion
you see in the brain in this video

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.656
is probably not right at all.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.096
There's very little room
in the cranial vault,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.816
only a few millimeters,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.016
and it's filled entirely
with cerebral spinal fluid,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.216
which acts as a protective layer.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.400
And so the brain as a whole probably
moves very little inside the skull.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.576
The other problem with this video

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.336
is that the brain is shown

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.456
as a kind of rigid whole
as it moves around,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.880
and that's not true either.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.136
Your brain is one of the softest
substances in your body,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.176
and you can think of it
kind of like jello.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.336
So as your head is moving back and forth,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.216
your brain is twisting
and turning and contorting,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.456
and the tissue is getting stretched.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.496
And so most experts, I think, would agree

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.656
that concussion is not likely
to be something that's happening

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.496
on this outer surface of the brain,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.616
but rather it's something
that's much deeper

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.200
towards the center of the brain.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.856
Now, the way that we're
approaching this problem

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.216
to try to understand
the mechanisms of concussion

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.096
and to figure out if we can prevent it

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.936
is we are using a device like this.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.160
It's a mouthguard.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.856
It has sensors in it
that are essentially the same

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.216
that are in your cell phone:

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.576
accelerometers, gyroscopes,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.496
and when someone is struck in the head,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.056
it can tell you how their head moved

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.200
at a thousand samples per second.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.456
The principle behind
the mouthguard is this:

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.736
it fits onto your teeth.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.816
Your teeth are one of the hardest
substances in your body.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.896
So it rigidly couples to your skull

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.336
and gives you the most precise
possible measurement

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.296
of how the skull moves.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.856
People have tried
other approaches, with helmets.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.256
We've looked at other sensors
that go on your skin,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.896
and they all simply move around too much,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.616
and so we found that this
is the only reliable way

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.000
to take a good measurement.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.696
So now that we've got this device,
we can go beyond studying cadavers,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.136
because you can only
learn so much about concussion

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.376
from studying a cadaver,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.176
and we want to learn
and study live humans.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.096
So where can we find
a group of willing volunteers

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.376
to go out and smash their heads
into each other on a regular basis

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.616
and sustain concussion?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.536
Well, I was one of them,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.360
and it's your local friendly
Stanford football team.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.256
So this is our laboratory,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.976
and I want to show you

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.176
the first concussion
we measured with this device.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.456
One of the things that I should point out
is the device has this gyroscope in it,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.216
and that allows you
to measure the rotation of the head.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.616
Most experts think
that that's the critical factor

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.496
that might start to tell us
what is happening in concussion.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.880
So please watch this video.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.696
Announcer: Cougars bring
extra people late, but Luck has time,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.360
and Winslow is crushed.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.696
I hope he's all right.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.680
(Audience roars)

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.016
Top of your screen,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.456
you'll see him come on
just this little post route,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.120
get separation, safety.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.800
Here it comes at you in real speed.
You'll hear this.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.520
The hit delivered by --

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.176
David Camarillo: Sorry, three times
is probably a little excessive there.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.456
But you get the idea.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.296
So when you look at just the film here,

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.136
pretty much the only thing you can see
is he got hit really hard and he was hurt.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.816
But when we extract the data

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.840
out of the mouthguard that he was wearing,

00:06:50.864 --> 00:06:53.576
we can see much more detail,
much richer information.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.016
And one of the things that we noticed here

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.096
is that he was struck
in the lower left side of his face mask.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.296
And so that did something first
that was a little counterintuitive.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.016
His head did not move to the right.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.976
In fact, it rotated first to the left.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.856
Then as the neck began to compress,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.976
the force of the blow caused it
to whip back to the right.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.856
So this left-right motion
was sort of a whiplash-type phenomenon,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.296
and we think that is probably
what led to the brain injury.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.096
Now, this device is only limited in such
that it can measure the skull motion,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.536
but what we really want to know
is what's happening inside of the brain.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.056
So we collaborate with
Svein Kleiven's group in Sweden.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.656
They've developed a finite element
model of the brain.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.776
And so this is a simulation

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.136
using the data from our mouthguard
from the injury I just showed you,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.176
and what you see is the brain --

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.616
this is a cross-section right in the front

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.416
of the brain twisting
and contorting as I mentioned.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.336
So you can see this doesn't
look a lot like the CDC video.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.216
Now, the colors that you're looking at

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.376
are how much the brain tissue
is being stretched.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.096
And so the red is 50 percent.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.776
That means the brain has been stretched
to 50 percent of its original length,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.496
the tissue in that particular area.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.776
And the main thing I want to draw
your attention to is this red spot.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.256
So the red spot is very close
to the center of the brain,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.536
and relatively speaking,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.216
you don't see a lot of colors like that
on the exterior surface

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.600
as the CDC video showed.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.696
Now, to explain a little more detail

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.336
about how we think
concussion might be happening,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.656
one thing I should mention

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.895
is that we and others have observed
that a concussion is more likely

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.895
when you're struck and your head
rotates in this direction.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.176
This is more common
in sports like football,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.535
but this seems to be more dangerous.
So what might be happening there?

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.576
Well, one thing that you'll notice
in the human brain

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.336
that is different than other animals

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.816
is we have these two very large lobes.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.056
We have the right brain
and the left brain.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.136
And the key thing
to notice in this figure here

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.416
is that right down the center
of the right brain and the left brain

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.376
there's a large fissure
that goes deep into the brain.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.256
And in that fissure,
what you can't see in this image,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.496
you'll have to trust me,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.216
there is a fibrous sheet of tissue.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.456
It's called the falx,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.136
and it runs from the front of your head
all the way to the back of your head,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.376
and it's quite stiff.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.856
And so what that allows for
is when you're struck

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.936
and your head rotates
in this left-right direction,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.736
forces can rapidly transmit
right down to the center of your brain.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.000
Now, what's there
at the bottom of this fissure?

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.616
It's the wiring of your brain,

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.256
and in fact this red bundle
here at the bottom of that fissure

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.256
is the single largest fiber bundle

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.256
that is the wiring that connects
the right and left sides of your brain.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.804
It's called the corpus callosum.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.416
And we think that this might be

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.256
one of the most common
mechanisms of concussion,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.976
and as the forces move down,
they strike the corpus callosum,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.976
it causes a dissociation
between your right and your left brain

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.480
and could explain some
of the symptoms of concussion.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.496
This finding is also consistent
of what we've seen

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.536
in this brain disease that I mentioned,
chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:13.096
So this is an image of a middle-aged
ex-professional football player,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.096
and the thing that I want to point out
is if you look at the corpus callosum,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.056
and I'll page back here so you can see
the size of a normal corpus callosum

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.496
and the size of the person here
who has chronic traumatic encephalopathy,

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.056
it is greatly atrophied.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.416
And the same goes
for all of the space in the ventricles.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.216
These ventricles are much larger.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.776
And so all of this tissue
near the center of the brain

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.016
has died off over time.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.600
So what we're learning
is indeed consistent.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.176
Now, there is some good news here,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.656
and I hope to give you a sense
of hope by the end of this talk.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.776
One of the things that we've noticed,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.056
specifically about
this mechanism of injury,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.136
is although there's a rapid transmission
of the forces down this fissure,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.456
it still takes a defined amount of time.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.816
And what we think is that if we can
slow the head down just enough

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.056
so that the brain
does not lag behind the skull

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.656
but instead it moves
in synchrony with the skull,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.936
then we might be able to prevent
this mechanism of concussion.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.640
So how can we slow the head down?

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.376
(Laughter)

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.360
A gigantic helmet.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.296
So with more space, you have more time,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.416
and this is a bit of a joke,
but some of you may have seen this.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.736
This is bubble soccer,
and it's a real sport.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.416
In fact, I saw some young adults

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.416
playing this sport down the street
from my house the other day,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.336
and as far as I know
there have been no reported concussions.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.376
(Laughter)

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.816
But in all seriousness,
this principle does work,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.216
but this has gone too far.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.496
This isn't something that's practical
for bike riding or playing football.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.896
And so we are collaborating
with a company in Sweden called Hövding.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.256
Some of you may have seen their work,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.656
and they're using the same principle
of air to give you some extra space

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.480
to prevent concussion.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.080
Kids, don't try this at home please.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.840
This stuntman does not have a helmet.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.456
He instead has a neck collar,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.056
and this neck collar has sensors in it,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.656
the same type of sensors
that are in our mouthguard,

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.816
and it detects when he's likely
to have a fall,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.176
and there's an airbag
that explodes and triggers,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.976
the same way that an airbag
works in your car, essentially.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.936
And in the experiments
we've done in my lab with their device,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.696
we found that it can greatly reduce
the risk of concussion in some scenarios

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.856
compared to a normal bicycle helmet.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.720
So it's a pretty exciting development.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.416
But in order for us to actually realize
the benefits of technology

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.296
that can prevent concussion,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.256
it needs to meet regulations.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.976
That's a reality.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.136
And this device is for sale in Europe

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.856
but is not for sale in the US,
and probably won't be any time soon.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.416
So I wanted to tell you why.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.216
There are some good reasons and then
there are some not so good reasons.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.456
Bike helmets are federally regulated.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.216
The Consumer Product Safety Commission
has been given jurisdiction

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.096
to approve any bike helmet for sale,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.576
and this is the test they use.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.256
This is back to what I was telling you
at the beginning about skull fracture.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.696
That's what this test is for.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.456
And that's an important thing to do.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.336
It can save your life,
but it's not sufficient, I would say.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.096
So for example, one thing
this test doesn't evaluate

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.936
is it doesn't tell you
is that airbag going to trigger

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.856
at the right time and place,
and not trigger when it doesn't need to?

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.936
Similarly, it's not going to tell you

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.336
is this helmet likely
to prevent concussion or not?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.096
And if you look at football helmets,
which aren't regulated,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.496
they still have a very similar test.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.776
They're not regulated
by the government, anyway.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.936
They have an industry body,
which is the way most industries work.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.976
But this industry body, I can tell you,
has been quite resistant

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.376
to updating their standards.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.656
So in my lab, we are working on not only
the mechanism of concussion,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.136
but we want to understand
how can we have better test standards?

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.696
And we hope that the government
can use this type of information

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.456
to encourage innovation

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.096
by letting consumers know

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.896
how protected are you with a given helmet.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.296
And I want to bring this back finally
to the original question I asked,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.656
which is, would I feel comfortable
letting my child play football

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.416
or ride a bicycle?

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.776
And this might be just a result
of my own traumatic experience.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.800
I'm much more nervous
about my daughter, Rose, riding a bicycle.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.576
So she's a year and a half old,

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.056
and she's already, well, wants to anyway,
race down the streets of San Francisco.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.416
This is the bottom
of one of these streets.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.656
And so my personal goal
is to -- and I believe this is possible --

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.736
is to further develop these technologies,

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.736
and in fact, we're working
on something in my lab in particular

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.713
that really makes optimal use
of the given space of a helmet.

00:14:53.737 --> 00:14:56.216
And I am confident
that we will be able to,

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.456
before she's ready to ride a two-wheeler,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.856
have something available

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.216
that can in fact really reduce
the risk of concussion

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.376
and comply with regulatory bodies.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.016
And so what I'd like to do --

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.416
and I know that this is for some of you
of more immediate nature,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.096
I've got a couple years here --

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.256
is to be able to tell parents
and grandparents when I'm asked,

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.696
it is safe and healthy for your children
to engage in these activities.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.536
And I'm very fortunate
to have a wonderful team at Stanford

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.456
that's working hard on this.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.576
So I hope to come back in a few years
with the final story,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.576
but for now I will tell you,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.536
please don't just be afraid
when you hear the word concussion.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.776
There is hope.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.016
Thank you.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.543
(Applause)
