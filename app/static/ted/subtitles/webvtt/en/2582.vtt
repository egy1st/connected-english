WEBVTT

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.496
You know, I didn't set out
to be a parenting expert.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.280
In fact, I'm not very interested
in parenting, per Se.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.016
It's just that there's a certain style
of parenting these days

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.216
that is kind of messing up kids,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:21.296
impeding their chances
to develop into theirselves.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.536
There's a certain style
of parenting these days

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.896
that's getting in the way.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.536
I guess what I'm saying is,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.616
we spend a lot of time
being very concerned

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.296
about parents who aren't involved enough
in the lives of their kids

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.256
and their education or their upbringing,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.480
and rightly so.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.376
But at the other end of the spectrum,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.096
there's a lot of harm
going on there as well,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.056
where parents feel
a kid can't be successful

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.136
unless the parent is protecting
and preventing at every turn

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.896
and hovering over every happening,
and micromanaging every moment,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.120
and steering their kid towards
some small subset of colleges and careers.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.376
When we raise kids this way,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.096
and I'll say we,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.896
because Lord knows,
in raising my two teenagers,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.656
I've had these tendencies myself,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.560
our kids end up leading
a kind of checklisted childhood.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.896
And here's what the checklisted
childhood looks like.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.816
We keep them safe and sound

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.520
and fed and watered,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.216
and then we want to be sure
they go to the right schools,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.816
that they're in the right classes
at the right schools,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.460
and that they get the right grades
in the right classes in the right schools.

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:32.216
But not just the grades, the scores,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.456
and not just the grades and scores,
but the accolades and the awards

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.671
and the sports,
the activities, the leadership.

00:01:37.695 --> 00:01:39.616
We tell our kids, don't just join a club,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.896
start a club, because colleges
want to see that.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.856
And check the box for community service.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.136
I mean, show the colleges
you care about others.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.256
(Laughter)

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.216
And all of this is done to some
hoped-for degree of perfection.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.856
We expect our kids
to perform at a level of perfection

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.216
we were never asked
to perform at ourselves,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.416
and so because so much is required,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.656
we think,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.896
well then, of course we parents
have to argue with every teacher

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.496
and principal and coach and referee

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.416
and act like our kid's concierge

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.680
and personal handler

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.696
and secretary.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.896
And then with our kids, our precious kids,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.056
we spend so much time nudging,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.496
cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling,
nagging as the case may be,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.376
to be sure they're not screwing up,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.896
not closing doors,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.416
not ruining their future,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.696
some hoped-for admission

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.336
to a tiny handful of colleges

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.440
that deny almost every applicant.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.096
And here's what it feels like
to be a kid in this checklisted childhood.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.616
First of all, there's
no time for free play.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.296
There's no room in the afternoons,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.336
because everything
has to be enriching, we think.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.736
It's as if every piece of homework,
every quiz, every activity

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.296
is a make-or-break moment
for this future we have in mind for them,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.256
and we absolve them
of helping out around the house,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.656
and we even absolve them
of getting enough sleep

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.576
as long as they're checking off
the items on their checklist.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.416
And in the checklisted childhood,
we say we just want them to be happy,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.496
but when they come home from school,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.656
what we ask about all too often first

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.736
is their homework and their grades.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.776
And they see in our faces

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.336
that our approval, that our love,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.976
that their very worth,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.856
comes from A's.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.456
And then we walk alongside them

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.176
and offer clucking praise like a trainer
at the Westminster Dog Show --

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.416
(Laughter)

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.736
coaxing them to just jump a little higher
and soar a little farther,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.816
day after day after day.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.576
And when they get to high school,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.496
they don't say, "Well, what might I
be interested in studying

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.776
or doing as an activity?"

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.496
They go to counselors and they say,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.096
"What do I need to do
to get into the right college?"

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.056
And then, when the grades
start to roll in in high school,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.656
and they're getting some B's,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.056
or God forbid some C's,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.016
they frantically text their friends

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.160
and say, "Has anyone ever gotten
into the right college with these grades?"

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.495
And our kids,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.136
regardless of where they end up
at the end of high school,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.400
they're breathless.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.616
They're brittle.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.456
They're a little burned out.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.376
They're a little old before their time,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.416
wishing the grown-ups in their lives
had said, "What you've done is enough,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.416
this effort you've put forth
in childhood is enough."

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.696
And they're withering now
under high rates of anxiety and depression

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.936
and some of them are wondering,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.320
will this life ever turn out
to have been worth it?

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.536
Well, we parents,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.936
we parents are pretty sure
it's all worth it.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.176
We seem to behave --

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.936
it's like we literally think
they will have no future

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.656
if they don't get into one of these
tiny set of colleges or careers

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.000
we have in mind for them.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.016
Or maybe, maybe, we're just afraid

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.376
they won't have a future we can brag about

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.200
to our friends and with stickers
on the backs of our cars.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.816
Yeah.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.160
(Applause)

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.456
But if you look at what we've done,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.016
if you have the courage
to really look at it,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.016
you'll see that not only do our kids
think their worth comes

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.736
from grades and scores,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.656
but that when we live right up inside
their precious developing minds

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.256
all the time, like our very own version
of the movie "Being John Malkovich,"

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.216
we send our children the message:

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.456
"Hey kid, I don't think you can actually
achieve any of this without me."

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.136
And so with our overhelp,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.696
our overprotection
and overdirection and hand-holding,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.736
we deprive our kids
of the chance to build self-efficacy,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.456
which is a really fundamental tenet
of the human psyche,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.096
far more important
than that self-esteem they get

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.520
every time we applaud.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.296
Self-efficacy is built when one sees
that one's own actions lead to outcomes,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.536
not --

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.776
There you go.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.640
(Applause)

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.376
Not one's parents'
actions on one's behalf,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.176
but when one's own actions
lead to outcomes.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.696
So simply put,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.056
if our children are to develop
self-efficacy, and they must,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.936
then they have to do a whole lot more
of the thinking, planning, deciding,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.536
doing, hoping, coping, trial and error,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.696
dreaming and experiencing of life

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.360
for themselves.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.776
Now, am I saying

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.136
every kid is hard-working and motivated

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.336
and doesn't need a parent's involvement
or interest in their lives,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.240
and we should just back off and let go?

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.256
Hell no.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.496
(Laughter)

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.216
That is not what I'm saying.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.856
What I'm saying is, when we treat
grades and scores and accolades and awards

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.976
as the purpose of childhood,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.776
all in furtherance of some hoped-for
admission to a tiny number of colleges

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.776
or entrance to a small number of careers,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.176
that that's too narrow a definition
of success for our kids.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.736
And even though we might help them
achieve some short-term wins

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.976
by overhelping --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.560
like they get a better grade
if we help them do their homework,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.200
they might end up with a longer
childhood résumé when we help --

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.496
what I'm saying is that all of this
comes at a long-term cost

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.576
to their sense of self.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.016
What I'm saying is,
we should be less concerned

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.856
with the specific set of colleges

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.096
they might be able
to apply to or might get into

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.016
and far more concerned that they have
the habits, the mindset, the skill set,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.976
the wellness, to be successful
wherever they go.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.216
What I'm saying is,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.816
our kids need us to be a little
less obsessed with grades and scores

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.136
and a whole lot more interested

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.256
in childhood providing
a foundation for their success

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.960
built on things like love

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.456
and chores.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.656
(Laughter)

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.600
(Applause)

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.480
Did I just say chores?
Did I just say chores? I really did.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.080
But really, here's why.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.936
The longest longitudinal study
of humans ever conducted

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.135
is called the Harvard Grant Study.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.496
It found that professional
success in life,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.096
which is what we want for our kids,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.896
that professional success in life
comes from having done chores as a kid,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.936
and the earlier you started, the better,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.336
that a roll-up-your-sleeves-
and-pitch-in mindset,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.736
a mindset that says,
there's some unpleasant work,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.976
someone's got to do it,
it might as well be me,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.216
a mindset that says,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.336
I will contribute my effort
to the betterment of the whole,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.416
that that's what gets you ahead
in the workplace.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.336
Now, we all know this. You know this.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.176
(Applause)

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.776
We all know this, and yet,
in the checklisted childhood,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.576
we absolve our kids of doing
the work of chores around the house,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.096
and then they end up
as young adults in the workplace

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.336
still waiting for a checklist,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.816
but it doesn't exist,

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.136
and more importantly,
lacking the impulse, the instinct

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.376
to roll up their sleeves and pitch in

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.976
and look around and wonder,
how can I be useful to my colleagues?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.320
How can I anticipate a few steps ahead
to what my boss might need?

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.880
A second very important finding
from the Harvard Grant Study

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.680
said that happiness in life

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.576
comes from love,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.456
not love of work,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.680
love of humans:

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.840
our spouse, our partner,
our friends, our family.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.296
So childhood needs to teach
our kids how to love,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.296
and they can't love others
if they don't first love themselves,

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.296
and they won't love themselves
if we can't offer them unconditional love.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.280
(Applause)

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.800
Right.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.016
And so,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.296
instead of being obsessed
with grades and scores

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.216
when our precious offspring
come home from school,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.736
or we come home from work,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.536
we need to close our technology,
put away our phones,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.936
and look them in the eye

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.136
and let them see
the joy that fills our faces

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.296
when we see our child
for the first time in a few hours.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.256
And then we have to say,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.480
"How was your day?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.656
What did you like about today?"

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.416
And when your teenage daughter
says, "Lunch," like mine did,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.496
and I want to hear about the math test,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.936
not lunch,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.976
you have to still
take an interest in lunch.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.176
You gotta say, "What was great
about lunch today?"

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.576
They need to know
they matter to us as humans,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.200
not because of their GPA.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.856
All right, so you're thinking,
chores and love,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.376
that sounds all well and good,
but give me a break.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.376
The colleges want to see
top scores and grades

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.320
and accolades and awards,
and I'm going to tell you, sort of.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.976
The very biggest brand-name schools
are asking that of our young adults,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.360
but here's the good news.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.256
Contrary to what the college
rankings racket would have us believe --

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.640
(Applause)

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.936
you don't have to go to one
of the biggest brand name schools

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.696
to be happy and successful in life.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.576
Happy and successful people
went to state school,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.856
went to a small college
no one has heard of,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.456
went to community college,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.216
went to a college over here
and flunked out.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.040
(Applause)

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.216
The evidence is in this room,
is in our communities,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.936
that this is the truth.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.656
And if we could widen our blinders

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.936
and be willing to look
at a few more colleges,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.496
maybe remove our own egos
from the equation,

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.176
we could accept and embrace
this truth and then realize,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.176
it is hardly the end of the world

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.720
if our kids don't go to one
of those big brand-name schools.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.216
And more importantly,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.336
if their childhood has not been lived
according to a tyrannical checklist

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.496
then when they get to college,

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.456
whichever one it is,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.576
well, they'll have gone there
on their own volition,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.056
fueled by their own desire,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.280
capable and ready to thrive there.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.160
I have to admit something to you.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.856
I've got two kids I mentioned,
Sawyer and Avery.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.576
They're teenagers.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.456
And once upon a time,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.096
I think I was treating my Sawyer and Avery

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.896
like little bonsai trees --

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.256
(Laughter)

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.216
that I was going
to carefully clip and prune

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.136
and shape into some perfect
form of a human

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.656
that might just be perfect enough
to warrant them admission

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.120
to one of the most
highly selective colleges.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.920
But I've come to realize, after working
with thousands of other people's kids --

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.360
(Laughter)

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.800
and raising two kids of my own,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.400
my kids aren't bonsai trees.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.520
They're wildflowers

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.216
of an unknown genus and species --

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.136
(Laughter)

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.576
and it's my job to provide
a nourishing environment,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.976
to strengthen them through chores

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.296
and to love them so they can
love others and receive love

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.416
and the college, the major, the career,

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.136
that's up to them.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.816
My job is not to make them become
what I would have them become,

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.640
but to support them
in becoming their glorious selves.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.616
Thank you.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:03.070
(Applause)
