00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.856
There's a man out there, somewhere,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.856
who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.256
or at least he did 20 years ago.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.096
I don't know anything else about him,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.016
except that he once saved my life

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.680
by putting his own life in danger.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.976
This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.776
to bring me back to safety

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.576
after a car accident
that could have killed me.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.256
And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.256
but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.920
to understand why he did it,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.536
what forces within him
caused him to make the choice

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.416
that I owe my life to,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.056
to risk his own life
to save the life of a stranger?

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.120
In other words, what are the causes of his
or anybody else's capacity for altruism?

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.856
But first let me tell you what happened.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.336
That night, I was 19 years old

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.736
and driving back to my home
in Tacoma, Washington,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.576
down the Interstate 5 freeway,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.136
when a little dog
darted out in front of my car.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.496
And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.880
which is swerve to avoid it.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.920
And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.056
I hit the dog anyways,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.696
and that sent the car into a fishtail,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.296
and then a spin across the freeway,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.896
until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.856
faced backwards into oncoming traffic

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.240
and then the engine died.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.040
And I was sure in that moment
that I was about to die too,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.096
but I didn't

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.856
because of the actions
of that one brave man

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.376
who must have made the decision

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.416
within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.696
to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.656
in the dark

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.656
to save my life.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.576
And then after he got my car working again

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.216
and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.776
he drove off again.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.136
He never even told me his name,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.320
and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.376
So before I go any further,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.856
I really want to take a moment

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.680
to stop and say thank you
to that stranger.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.000
(Applause)

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.136
I tell you all of this

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.376
because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.016
I became a psychology researcher,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.816
and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.176
Where does it come from,
and how does it develop,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.440
and what are the extreme forms
that it can take?

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.296
These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.560
of human social nature.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.416
A lot of people,
and this includes everybody

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.336
from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.616
believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.816
that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.136
But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.656
do selfless things,
like helping other people

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.120
at enormous risk and cost to themselves?

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.176
Answering this question

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.296
requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.696
and what might make people
who engage in such acts

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.576
different than other people.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.680
But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.736
The actions of the man who rescued me

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.736
meet the most stringent
definition of altruism,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.376
which is a voluntary, costly behavior

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.840
motivated by the desire
to help another individual.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.760
So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.120
What could possibly
explain an action like that?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.056
One answer is compassion, obviously,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.880
which is a key driver of altruism.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.136
But then the question becomes,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.920
why do some people
seem to have more of it than others?

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.016
And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.240
are different in fundamental ways.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.016
But to figure out how,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.160
I actually started from the opposite end,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.360
with psychopaths.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.776
A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.816
like the desire to help other people,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.976
is to study people
in whom that desire is missing,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.120
and psychopaths are exactly such a group.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.576
Psychopathy is a developmental disorder

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.696
with strongly genetic origins,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.616
and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.164
and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.296
Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.935
conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.096
of psychopathic adolescents,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.976
and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.296
have shown that people
who are psychopathic

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.240
pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.776
First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.576
they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.816
And in particular,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.736
they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.456
And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.096
and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.376
in people who see them,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.096
so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.240
also tend to be insensitive to these cues.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.736
The part of the brain

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.656
that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.936
is called the amygdala.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.376
There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.256
and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.656
And whereas healthy adults and children

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.296
usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.456
when they look at fearful expressions,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.616
psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.296
Sometimes they don't react at all,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.940
which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.376
Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.000
by about 18 or 20 percent.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.736
So all of these findings
are reliable and robust,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.216
and they're very interesting.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.896
But remember that my main interest

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.456
is not understanding
why people don't care about others.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.040
It's understanding why they do.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.176
So the real question is,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.456
could extraordinary altruism,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.696
which is the opposite of psychopathy

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.136
in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.176
emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.440
A sort of antipsychopathic brain,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.976
better able to recognize
other people's fear,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.416
an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.280
and maybe larger than average as well?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.936
As my research has now shown,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.416
all three things are true.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.696
And we discovered this

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.736
by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.416
These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.640
to a complete stranger.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.696
So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.336
so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.416
and transplanted into a very ill stranger

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.480
that they've never met and may never meet.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.840
"Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.896
And the answer may be

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.176
that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.000
have certain special characteristics.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.256
They are better at recognizing
other people's fear.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.696
They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.376
This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.336
And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.696
was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.616
And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.856
by about eight percent.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.616
So together, what these data suggest

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.256
is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.816
that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.336
and at the other by people
who are very compassionate

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.280
and driven to acts of extreme altruism.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.696
But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.416
is not just that they're
more compassionate than average.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.656
They are,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.576
but what's even more unusual about them

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.696
is that they're compassionate
and altruistic

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.656
not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.656
of friends and family. Right?

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.936
Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.160
is not extraordinary.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.216
Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.456
even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.416
to people who are outside
their social circle altogether,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.976
total strangers,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.600
just like the man who rescued me.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.456
And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.856
how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.216
that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.736
And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.816
I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.816
when so many other people don't?

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.256
You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.896
who has ever given a kidney to a stranger.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.760
What is it that makes you so special?"

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.680
And what do they say?

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.320
They say, "Nothing.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.976
There's nothing special about me.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.799
I'm just the same as everybody else."

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.296
And I think that's actually
a really telling answer,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.160
because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.216
they look more like this.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.480
They have no center.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.736
These altruists literally
don't think of themselves

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.016
as being at the center of anything,

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.000
as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.216
When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.960
she said, "Because it's not about me."

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.776
Another said,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.056
"I'm not different. I'm not unique.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.416
Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you."

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.536
I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.416
is humility,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.536
which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.080
makes men as angels.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.816
And why is that?

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.616
It's because if there's
no center of your circle,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.176
there can be no inner rings
or outer rings,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.096
nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.320
than anybody else.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.416
And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.680
from the average person.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.976
But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.976
and maybe even most people.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.256
And I think this
because at the societal level,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.000
expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.376
The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.656
that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.136
of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.216
which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.760
from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.296
And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.416
A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.936
how normal and ordinary it is

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.256
for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.920
to complete strangers today.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.816
Is it possible that
a hundred years from now

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.416
people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.896
is just as normal and ordinary

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.936
as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today?

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.160
Maybe.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.696
So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes?

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.496
In part it seems to be

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.720
increases in wealth
and standards of living.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.336
As societies become
wealthier and better off,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.976
people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.856
and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.600
from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.416
But all of these changes also yield

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.656
a strange and paradoxical result,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.216
which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.456
which it is,

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.176
there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.240
and more cruel, which it's not.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.896
And I don't know exactly why this is,

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.496
but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.696
about the suffering
of strangers in distant places,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.136
and so we now care a lot more

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.360
about the suffering
of those distant strangers.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.936
But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.416
that the roots of altruism and compassion

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.456
are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.176
maybe even more so,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.256
and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.376
to the suffering of distant others,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.176
I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.976
from the center of the circle

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.056
and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.880
is within reach for almost everyone.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.296
Thank you.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:08.898
(Applause)
