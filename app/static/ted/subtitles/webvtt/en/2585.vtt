00:00:01.178 --> 00:00:02.590
How much do you get paid?

00:00:03.155 --> 00:00:05.043
Don't answer that out loud.

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.447
But put a number in your head.

00:00:08.017 --> 00:00:12.660
Now: How much do you think the person
sitting next to you gets paid?

00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:15.335
Again, don't answer out loud.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:16.461
(Laughter)

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:19.502
At work, how much do you think

00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:23.464
the person sitting in the cubicle
or the desk next to you gets paid?

00:00:23.488 --> 00:00:24.643
Do you know?

00:00:24.977 --> 00:00:26.342
Should you know?

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:30.938
Notice, it's a little uncomfortable for me
to even ask you those questions.

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:34.112
But admit it -- you kind of want to know.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:38.518
Most of us are uncomfortable with the idea
of broadcasting our salary.

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:40.691
We're not supposed to tell our neighbors,

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.907
and we're definitely not supposed
to tell our office neighbors.

00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:47.445
The assumed reason is that if everybody
knew what everybody got paid,

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.259
then all hell would break loose.

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:51.384
There'd be arguments, there'd be fights,

00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:53.597
there might even be a few people who quit.

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:57.400
But what if secrecy is actually
the reason for all that strife?

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.042
And what would happen
if we removed that secrecy?

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:04.590
What if openness actually increased
the sense of fairness and collaboration

00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:05.836
inside a company?

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.446
What would happen if we had
total pay transparency?

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:11.571
For the past several years,

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:14.508
I've been studying the corporate
and entrepreneurial leaders

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:18.081
who question the conventional wisdom
about how to run a company.

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:20.557
And the question of pay keeps coming up.

00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:23.555
And the answers keep surprising.

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:26.265
It turns out that pay transparency --

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.399
sharing salaries openly
across a company --

00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:31.072
makes for a better workplace
for both the employee

00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:32.683
and for the organization.

00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:36.461
When people don't know how their pay
compares to their peers',

00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:38.301
they're more likely to feel underpaid

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:40.260
and maybe even discriminated against.

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:43.221
Do you want to work at a place
that tolerates the idea

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:46.049
that you feel underpaid
or discriminated against?

00:01:46.697 --> 00:01:49.207
But keeping salaries secret
does exactly that,

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:52.114
and it's a practice
as old as it is common,

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:54.766
despite the fact
that in the United States,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.240
the law protects an employee's right
to discuss their pay.

00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:01.975
In one famous example from decades ago,

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.105
the management of Vanity Fair magazine

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:06.249
actually circulated a memo entitled:

00:02:06.273 --> 00:02:09.478
"Forbidding Discussion Among
Employees of Salary Received."

00:02:09.502 --> 00:02:12.824
"Forbidding" discussion among
employees of salary received.

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:15.629
Now that memo didn't sit well
with everybody.

00:02:15.653 --> 00:02:17.699
New York literary figures
Dorothy Parker,

00:02:17.723 --> 00:02:19.485
Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood,

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.950
all writers in the Algonquin Round Table,

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.755
decided to stand up for transparency

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.511
and showed up for work the next day

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:28.749
with their salary written on signs
hanging from their neck.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.321
(Laughter)

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.291
Imagine showing up for work

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:35.805
with your salary just written
across your chest for all to see.

00:02:37.573 --> 00:02:40.843
But why would a company even want
to discourage salary discussions?

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:44.199
Why do some people go along with it,
while others revolt against it?

00:02:45.906 --> 00:02:48.950
It turns out that in addition
to the assumed reasons,

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:52.277
pay secrecy is actually a way
to save a lot of money.

00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:54.212
You see, keeping salaries secret

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:57.187
leads to what economists call
"information asymmetry."

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.482
This is a situation where,
in a negotiation,

00:02:59.506 --> 00:03:02.504
one party has loads more
information than the other.

00:03:02.887 --> 00:03:06.297
And in hiring or promotion
or annual raise discussions,

00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:09.979
an employer can use that secrecy
to save a lot of money.

00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:13.142
Imagine how much better
you could negotiate for a raise

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:14.973
if you knew everybody's salary.

00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:20.053
Economists warn that information asymmetry

00:03:20.077 --> 00:03:21.724
can cause markets to go awry.

00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:23.654
Someone leaves a pay stub on the copier,

00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:26.096
and suddenly everybody
is shouting at each other.

00:03:26.866 --> 00:03:28.572
In fact, they even warn

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:33.413
that information asymmetry
can lead to a total market failure.

00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:36.109
And I think we're almost there.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:37.299
Here's why:

00:03:37.323 --> 00:03:42.251
first, most employees have no idea
how their pay compares to their peers'.

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:46.684
In a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees,

00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:50.089
two-thirds of everyone who is paid
at the market rate

00:03:50.113 --> 00:03:52.345
said that they felt they were underpaid.

00:03:53.036 --> 00:03:55.915
And of everybody who felt
that they were underpaid,

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.892
60 percent said
that they intended to quit,

00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:01.804
regardless of where they were --
underpaid, overpaid

00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:03.407
or right at the market rate.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.660
If you were part of this survey,
what would you say?

00:04:06.684 --> 00:04:07.960
Are you underpaid?

00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:10.309
Well, wait -- how do you even know,

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.466
because you're not allowed
to talk about it?

00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:16.510
Next, information asymmetry, pay secrecy,

00:04:16.534 --> 00:04:19.313
makes it easier to ignore
the discrimination

00:04:19.337 --> 00:04:21.804
that's already present
in the market today.

00:04:22.217 --> 00:04:25.914
In a 2011 report from the Institute
for Women's Policy Research,

00:04:25.938 --> 00:04:28.062
the gender wage gap
between men and women

00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:29.824
was 23 percent.

00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:33.070
This is where that 77 cents
on the dollar comes from.

00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:35.104
But in the Federal Government,

00:04:35.128 --> 00:04:37.191
where salaries are pinned
to certain levels

00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:39.255
and everybody knows
what those levels are,

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.364
the gender wage gap
shrinks to 11 percent --

00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:43.964
and this is before controlling
for any of the factors

00:04:43.988 --> 00:04:46.881
that economists argue over
whether or not to control for.

00:04:47.264 --> 00:04:49.936
If we really want to close
the gender wage gap,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.448
maybe we should start
by opening up the payroll.

00:04:52.864 --> 00:04:56.086
If this is what total
market failure looks like,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.378
then openness remains
the only way to ensure fairness.

00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:02.775
Now, I realize that letting people
know what you make

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:04.445
might feel uncomfortable,

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:05.984
but isn't it less uncomfortable

00:05:06.008 --> 00:05:08.888
than always wondering
if you're being discriminated against,

00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:12.674
or if your wife or your daughter
or your sister is being paid unfairly?

00:05:13.353 --> 00:05:17.293
Openness remains the best way
to ensure fairness,

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.230
and pay transparency does that.

00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:22.671
That's why entrepreneurial leaders
and corporate leaders

00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:25.488
have been experimenting
with sharing salaries for years.

00:05:25.512 --> 00:05:26.925
Like Dane Atkinson.

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.828
Dane is a serial entrepreneur
who started many companies

00:05:30.852 --> 00:05:32.434
in a pay secrecy condition

00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:35.811
and even used that condition
to pay two equally qualified people

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.531
dramatically different salaries,

00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:39.724
depending on how well
they could negotiate.

00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:43.422
And Dane saw the strife
that happened as a result of this.

00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:46.115
So when he started
his newest company, SumAll,

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.249
he committed to salary transparency
from the beginning.

00:05:49.821 --> 00:05:51.559
And the results have been amazing.

00:05:52.424 --> 00:05:54.046
And in study after study,

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.946
when people know
how they're being paid

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.999
and how that pay compares to their peers',

00:05:58.023 --> 00:06:00.956
they're more likely to work hard
to improve their performance,

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.829
more likely to be engaged,
and they're less likely to quit.

00:06:03.853 --> 00:06:05.255
That's why Dane's not alone.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.450
From technology start-ups like Buffer,

00:06:07.915 --> 00:06:11.261
to the tens of thousands
of employees at Whole Foods,

00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:14.452
where not only is your salary
available for everyone to see,

00:06:14.476 --> 00:06:17.476
but the performance data
for the store and for your department

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.419
is available on the company intranet

00:06:19.443 --> 00:06:20.665
for all to see.

00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:24.447
Now, pay transparency
takes a lot of forms.

00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:26.069
It's not one size fits all.

00:06:26.093 --> 00:06:28.589
Some post their salaries for all to see.

00:06:28.613 --> 00:06:30.914
Some only keep it inside the company.

00:06:30.938 --> 00:06:33.523
Some post the formula for calculating pay,

00:06:33.547 --> 00:06:35.321
and others post the pay levels

00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:37.123
and affix everybody to that level.

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.196
So you don't have to make signs

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.744
for all of your employees
to wear around the office.

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:44.682
And you don't have to be
the only one wearing a sign

00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:45.928
that you made at home.

00:06:46.494 --> 00:06:49.698
But we can all take greater steps
towards pay transparency.

00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:52.261
For those of you that have the authority

00:06:52.285 --> 00:06:54.079
to move forward towards transparency:

00:06:54.103 --> 00:06:55.578
it's time to move forward.

00:06:55.943 --> 00:06:58.411
And for those of you
that don't have that authority:

00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:00.414
it's time to stand up for your right to.

00:07:01.263 --> 00:07:02.988
So how much do you get paid?

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:06.813
And how does that compare
to the people you work with?

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.496
You should know.

00:07:09.312 --> 00:07:10.587
And so should they.

00:07:11.936 --> 00:07:13.104
Thank you.

00:07:13.128 --> 00:07:16.306
(Applause)
