00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:05.246
When I opened Mott Hall
Bridges Academy in 2010,

00:00:06.037 --> 00:00:07.674
my goal was simple:

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:11.563
open a school to close a prison.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:15.510
Now to some, this was an audacious goal,

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:19.161
because our school is located
in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn --

00:00:19.773 --> 00:00:22.973
one of the most underserved
and violent neighborhoods

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:25.063
in all of New York City.

00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:29.673
Like many urban schools
with high poverty rates,

00:00:30.427 --> 00:00:32.507
we face numerous challenges,

00:00:33.173 --> 00:00:35.599
like finding teachers who can empathize

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:39.220
with the complexities
of a disadvantaged community,

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:42.651
lack of funding for technology,

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.615
low parental involvement

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:51.357
and neighborhood gangs that recruit
children as early as fourth grade.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.292
So here I was,

00:00:55.416 --> 00:01:01.142
the founding principal of a middle school
that was a district public school,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.855
and I only had 45 kids to start.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:08.540
Thirty percent of them had special needs.

00:01:09.797 --> 00:01:12.838
Eighty-six percent of them
were below grade level

00:01:12.862 --> 00:01:14.884
in English and in math.

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:19.971
And 100 percent were living
below the poverty level.

00:01:21.258 --> 00:01:24.567
If our children are not in our classrooms,

00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:25.937
how will they learn?

00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:28.505
And if they're not learning,

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:30.231
where would they end up?

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:36.372
It was evident when I would
ask my 13-year-old,

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:37.657
"Young man,

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:41.018
where do you see yourself in five years?"

00:01:41.663 --> 00:01:43.322
And his response:

00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:45.912
"I don't know if I'm gonna
live that long."

00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:49.847
Or to have a young woman say to me

00:01:51.252 --> 00:01:56.232
that she had a lifelong goal
of working in a fast-food restaurant.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.969
To me, this was unacceptable.

00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:03.099
It was also evident that they had no idea

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.268
that there was a landscape of opportunity

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:08.040
that existed beyond their neighborhood.

00:02:09.055 --> 00:02:13.799
We call our students "scholars,"
because they're lifelong learners.

00:02:14.597 --> 00:02:16.377
And the skills that they learn today

00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:19.722
will prepare them for college
and career readiness.

00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:25.072
I chose the royal colors
of purple and black,

00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:30.560
because I want them to be reminded
that they are descendants of greatness,

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.409
and that through education,

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:34.480
they are future engineers,

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:35.666
scientists,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.053
entrepreneurs

00:02:37.077 --> 00:02:41.389
and even leaders who can and will
take over this world.

00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:43.822
To date,

00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:47.348
we have had three graduating classes,

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.345
at a 98 --

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:53.484
(Applause)

00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:01.183
At a 98-percent graduation rate.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.953
This is nearly 200 children,

00:03:04.977 --> 00:03:08.233
who are now going to some of the most
competitive high schools

00:03:08.257 --> 00:03:09.731
in New York City.

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:15.319
(Applause)

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:20.186
It was a cold day in January

00:03:20.872 --> 00:03:24.566
when my scholar, Vidal Chastanet,
met Brandon Stanton,

00:03:25.462 --> 00:03:29.255
the founder of the popular blog
"Humans of New York."

00:03:30.102 --> 00:03:33.995
Brandon shared the story
of a young man from Brownsville

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.739
who had witnessed violence firsthand,

00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:41.502
by witnessing a man
being thrown off of a roof.

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:45.703
Yet he can still
be influenced by a principal

00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:49.204
who had opened up a school
that believes in all children.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.095
Vidal embodies the story of so many
of our underprivileged children

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:58.230
who are struggling to survive,

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.650
which is why we must
make education a priority.

00:04:03.992 --> 00:04:07.204
Brandon's post created a global sensation

00:04:07.228 --> 00:04:09.607
that touched the lives of millions.

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:14.810
This resulted in 1.4 million
dollars being raised

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.311
for our scholars to attend field trips
to colleges and universities,

00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:24.279
Summer STEAM programs,

00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:26.594
as well as college scholarships.

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:28.969
You need to understand

00:04:28.993 --> 00:04:34.462
that when 200 young people
from Brownsville visited Harvard,

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:37.137
they now understood

00:04:37.161 --> 00:04:41.431
that a college of their choice
was a real possibility.

00:04:42.457 --> 00:04:45.895
And the impossibilities
that had been imposed upon them

00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:48.561
by a disadvantaged community

00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:52.122
were replaced by hope and purpose.

00:04:53.498 --> 00:04:58.484
The revolution in education
is happening in our schools,

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.703
with adults who provide love,

00:05:02.727 --> 00:05:03.903
structure,

00:05:03.927 --> 00:05:05.089
support

00:05:05.113 --> 00:05:06.363
and knowledge.

00:05:06.963 --> 00:05:09.782
These are the things
that inspire children.

00:05:10.806 --> 00:05:13.109
But it is not an easy task.

00:05:13.815 --> 00:05:15.854
And there are high demands

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:19.953
within an education system
that is not perfect.

00:05:20.893 --> 00:05:23.850
But I have a dynamic group of educators

00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:29.026
who collaborate as a team to determine
what is the best curriculum.

00:05:29.553 --> 00:05:32.423
They take time beyond their school day,

00:05:32.447 --> 00:05:33.744
and come in on weekends

00:05:33.768 --> 00:05:38.221
and even use their own money
to often provide resources

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:40.624
when we do not have it.

00:05:41.804 --> 00:05:43.652
And as the principal,

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.562
I have to inspect what I expect.

00:05:47.308 --> 00:05:49.157
So I show up in classes

00:05:49.836 --> 00:05:52.922
and I conduct observations
to give feedback,

00:05:52.946 --> 00:05:56.361
because I want my teachers
to be just as successful

00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:58.700
as the name Mott Hall Bridges Academy.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.622
And I give them access to me
every single day,

00:06:03.646 --> 00:06:06.510
which is why they all have
my personal cell number,

00:06:06.534 --> 00:06:09.592
including my scholars
and those who graduated --

00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:12.574
which is probably why I get
phone calls and text messages

00:06:12.598 --> 00:06:14.362
at three o'clock in the morning.

00:06:14.386 --> 00:06:15.571
(Laughter)

00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:18.770
But we are all connected to succeed,

00:06:18.794 --> 00:06:20.702
and good leaders do this.

00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:25.546
Tomorrow's future is sitting
in our classrooms.

00:06:26.304 --> 00:06:28.407
And they are our responsibility.

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:31.503
That means everyone in here,

00:06:31.527 --> 00:06:33.657
and those who are watching the screen.

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:37.019
We must believe in their brilliance,

00:06:38.234 --> 00:06:40.843
and remind them by teaching them

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:45.361
that there indeed is power in education.

00:06:46.047 --> 00:06:47.227
Thank you.

00:06:47.251 --> 00:06:57.379
(Applause)
