WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Why bother?

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.800
The game is rigged.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.440
My vote won't count.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.960
The choices are terrible.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.080
Voting is for suckers.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.416
Perhaps you've thought
some of these things.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.869
Perhaps you've even said them.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.960
And if so, you wouldn't be alone,
and you wouldn't be entirely wrong.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.056
The game of public policy today
is rigged in many ways.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.056
How else would more than half
of federal tax breaks

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.560
flow up to the wealthiest
five percent of Americans?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.600
And our choices indeed are often terrible.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.536
For many people
across the political spectrum,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.720
Exhibit A is the 2016
presidential election.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.296
But in any year, you can look
up and down the ballot

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.000
and find plenty to be uninspired about.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.976
But in spite of all this,
I still believe voting matters.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.896
And crazy as it may sound,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.160
I believe we can revive the joy of voting.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.320
Today, I want to talk
about how we can do that, and why.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.256
There used to be a time
in American history when voting was fun,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.480
when it was much more than just
a grim duty to show up at the polls.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.496
That time is called
"most of American history."

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.936
(Laughter)

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.936
From the Revolution
to the Civil Rights Era,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.536
the United States had a vibrant,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.800
robustly participatory
and raucous culture of voting.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.616
It was street theater, open-air debates,
fasting and feasting and toasting,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.696
parades and bonfires.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.256
During the 19th century,
immigrants and urban political machines

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.040
helped fuel this culture of voting.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.920
That culture grew with each
successive wave of new voters.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.976
During Reconstruction,
when new African-American voters,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.720
new African-American citizens,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.576
began to exercise their power,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.816
they celebrated in jubilee parades

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.200
that connected emancipation
with their newfound right to vote.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.840
A few decades later, the suffragettes

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.776
brought a spirit
of theatricality to their fight,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.920
marching together in white dresses
as they claimed the franchise.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.216
And the Civil Rights Movement,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.015
which sought to redeem
the promise of equal citizenship

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.039
that had been betrayed by Jim Crow,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.277
put voting right at the center.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.736
From Freedom Summer to the march in Selma,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.976
that generation of activists
knew that voting matters,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.096
and they knew that spectacle
and the performance of power

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.080
is key to actually claiming power.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.080
But it's been over a half century
since Selma and the Voting Rights Act,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.856
and in the decades since,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.176
this face-to-face culture of voting

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.176
has just about disappeared.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.136
It's been killed by television

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.696
and then the internet.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.016
The couch has replaced the commons.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.016
Screens have made
citizens into spectators.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.336
And while it's nice to share
political memes on social media,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.520
that's a rather quiet kind of citizenship.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.200
It's what the sociologist Sherry Turkle
calls "being alone together."

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.816
What we need today

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.696
is an electoral culture
that is about being together together,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.936
in person,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.176
in loud and passionate ways,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.456
so that instead of being
"eat your vegetables" or "do you duty,"

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.456
voting can feel more like "join the club"

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.160
or, better yet, "join the party."

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.696
Imagine if we had,
across the country right now,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.656
in local places but nationwide,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.336
a concerted effort
to revive a face-to-face set of ways

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.880
to engage and electioneer:

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.456
outdoor shows in which candidates
and their causes are mocked

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.176
and praised in broad satirical style;

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.120
soapbox speeches by citizens;

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.160
public debates held inside pubs;

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.656
streets filled with political art
and handmade posters and murals;

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.720
battle of the band concerts in which
competing performers rep their candidates.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.416
Now, all of this may sound
a little bit 18th century to you,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.776
but in fact, it doesn't have to be
any more 18th century

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.016
than, say, Broadway's "Hamilton,"

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.040
which is to say vibrantly contemporary.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.640
And the fact is that all around the world,

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:11.256
today, millions of people
are voting like this.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.536
In India, elections are colorful,
communal affairs.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.320
In Brazil, election day
is a festive, carnival-type atmosphere.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.456
In Taiwan and Hong Kong,
there is a spectacle,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.736
eye-popping, eye-grabbing spectacle

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.040
to the street theater of elections.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.456
You might ask, well,
here in America, who has time for this?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.736
And I would tell you

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.840
that the average American
watches five hours of television a day.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.536
You might ask, who has the motivation?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.776
And I'll tell you,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.936
any citizen who wants to be seen and heard

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.256
not as a prop, not as a talking point,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.600
but as a participant, as a creator.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.080
Well, how do we make this happen?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.320
Simply by making it happen.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.776
That's why a group of colleagues and I

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.880
launched a new project
called "The Joy of Voting."

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.336
In four cities across the United States --

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.016
Philadelphia, Miami,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.496
Akron, Ohio, and Wichita, Kansas --

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.456
we've gathered together
artists and activists,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.216
educators, political folks,
neighbors, everyday citizens

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.976
to come together and create projects

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.560
that can foster this culture
of voting in a local way.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.296
In Miami, that means
all-night parties with hot DJs

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.654
where the only way to get in
is to show that you're registered to vote.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.176
In Akron, it means political plays

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.736
being performed
in the bed of a flatbed truck

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.880
that moves from neighborhood
to neighborhood.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.176
In Philadelphia,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.136
it's a voting-themed scavenger hunt
all throughout colonial old town.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.176
And in Wichita, it's making
mixtapes and live graffiti art

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.000
in the North End to get out the vote.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.256
There are 20 of these projects,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.136
and they are remarkable
in their beauty and their diversity,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.736
and they are changing people.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.816
Let me tell you about a couple of them.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.816
In Miami, we've commissioned and artist,

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.856
a young artist named Atomico,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.120
to create some vivid and vibrant images
for a new series of "I voted" stickers.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.400
But the thing is, Atomico had never voted.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.776
He wasn't even registered.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.296
So as he got to work on creating
this artwork for these stickers,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.456
he also began to get over
his sense of intimidation about politics.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.096
He got himself registered,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.416
and then he got educated
about the upcoming primary election,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.736
and on election day he was out there
not just passing out stickers,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.336
but chatting up voters
and encouraging people to vote,

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.640
and talking about
the election with passersby.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.496
In Akron, a theater company
called the Wandering Aesthetics

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.296
has been putting on
these pickup truck plays.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.096
And to do so, they put out
an open call to the public

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.616
asking for speeches,
monologues, dialogues, poems,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.976
snippets of anything
that could be read aloud

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.560
and woven into a performance.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.040
They got dozens of submissions.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.616
One of them was a poem

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.776
written by nine students in an ESL class,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.936
all of them Hispanic migrant workers

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.320
from nearby Hartville, Ohio.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.000
I want to read to you from this poem.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.760
It's called "The Joy of Voting."

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.016
"I would like to vote for the first time

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.080
because things are changing for Hispanics.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.136
I used to be afraid of ghosts.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.400
Now I am afraid of people.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.280
There's more violence and racism.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.400
Voting can change this.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.320
The border wall is nothing.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.000
It's just a wall.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.640
The wall of shame is something.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.696
It's very important to vote

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.080
so we can break down this wall of shame.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.880
I have passion in my heart.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.520
Voting gives me a voice and power.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.720
I can stand up and do something."

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.896
"The Joy of Voting" project
isn't just about joy.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.456
It's about this passion.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.816
It's about feeling and belief,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.040
and it isn't just our organization's work.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.496
All across this country right now,

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.896
immigrants, young people, veterans,
people of all different backgrounds

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.416
are coming together to create
this kind of passionate, joyful activity

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.856
around elections,

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.816
in red and blue states,
in urban and rural communities,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.936
people of every political background.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.656
What they have in common is simply this:

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.200
their work is rooted in place.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.080
Because remember,
all citizenship is local.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.256
When politics becomes
just a presidential election,

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.880
we yell and we scream at our screens,
and then we collapse, exhausted.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.296
But when politics is about us

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.096
and our neighbors
and other people in our community

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.480
coming together to create experiences
of collective voice and imagination,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.880
then we begin to remember
that this stuff matters.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.000
We begin to remember
that this is the stuff of self-government.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.080
Which brings me back to where I began.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.080
Why bother?

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.545
There's one way to answer this question.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.640
Voting matters because it is
a self-fulfilling act of belief.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.840
It feeds the spirit of mutual interest
that makes any society thrive.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.616
When we vote, even if it is in anger,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.600
we are part of a collective,
creative leap of faith.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.360
Voting helps us generate
the very power that we wish we had.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.056
It's no accident
that democracy and theater

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.480
emerged around the same time
in ancient Athens.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.440
Both of them yank the individual
out of the enclosure of her private self.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.080
Both of them create great
public experiences of shared ritual.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.736
Both of them bring the imagination to life

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.056
in ways that remind us
that all of our bonds in the end

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.920
are imagined, and can be reimagined.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.960
This moment right now,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.216
when we think about
the meaning of imagination,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.440
is so fundamentally important,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.656
and our ability to take that spirit

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.256
and to take that sense

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.336
that there is something greater out there,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.136
is not just a matter
of technical expertise.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.216
It's not just a matter of making the time
or having the know-how.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.520
It is a matter of spirit.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.656
But let me give you an answer
to this question, "Why bother?"

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.120
that is maybe a little less spiritual
and a bit more pointed.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.216
Why bother voting?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.136
Because there is
no such thing as not voting.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.976
Not voting is voting,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.896
for everything that you
may detest and oppose.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.656
Not voting can be dressed up

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.696
as an act of principled,
passive resistance,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.656
but in fact not voting

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.896
is actively handing power over

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.256
to those whose interests
are counter to your own,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.816
and those who would be very glad
to take advantage of your absence.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.160
Not voting is for suckers.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.496
Imagine where this country would be

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.616
if all the folks who in 2010
created the Tea Party

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.576
had decided that,
you know, politics is too messy,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.856
voting is too complicated.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.680
There is no possibility
of our votes adding up to anything.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.616
They didn't preemptively
silence themselves.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.416
They showed up,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.800
and in the course of showing up,
they changed American politics.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.256
Imagine if all of the followers
of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.976
had decided not to upend
the political status quo

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.056
and blow apart the frame
of the previously possible

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.696
in American politics.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.680
They did that by voting.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.376
We live in a time right now,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.936
divided, often very dark,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.576
where across the left and the right,
there's a lot of talk of revolution

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.680
and the need for revolution
to disrupt everyday democracy.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.736
Well, here's the thing:

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.760
everyday democracy already
gives us a playbook for revolution.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.816
In the 2012 presidential election,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.576
young voters, Latino voters,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.856
Asian-American voters, low-income voters,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.400
all showed up at less than 50 percent.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.256
In the 2014 midterm elections,
turnout was 36 percent,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.960
which was a 70-year low.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.816
And in your average local election,

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.200
turnout hovers
somewhere around 20 percent.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.560
I invite you to imagine 100 percent.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.360
Picture 100 percent.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.216
Mobilize 100 percent,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.480
and overnight, we get revolution.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.056
Overnight, the policy priorities
of this country change dramatically,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.616
and every level of government
becomes radically more responsive

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.920
to all the people.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.800
What would it take
to mobilize 100 percent?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.016
Well, we do have to push back
against efforts afoot

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.776
all across the country right now

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.000
to make voting harder.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.976
But at the same time,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.136
we have to actively create
a positive culture of voting

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.776
that people want to belong to,

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.336
be part of, and experience together.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.976
We have to make purpose.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.320
We have to make joy.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.816
So yes, let's have that revolution,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.336
a revolution of spirit, of ideas,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.376
of policy and participation,

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.536
a revolution against cynicism,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.000
a revolution against the self-fulfilling
sense of powerlessness.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.856
Let's vote this revolution into existence,

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.216
and while we're at it,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.776
let's have some fun.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.016
Thank you very much.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.320
(Applause)
