00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.695
I remember the very first time
I went to a nice restaurant,

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:05.336
a really nice restaurant.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.496
It was for a law firm recruitment dinner,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.976
and I remember beforehand
the waitress walked around

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.856
and asked whether we wanted some wine,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.000
so I said, "Sure,
I'll take some white wine."

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.536
And she immediately said,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.000
"Would you like sauvignon blanc
or chardonnay?"

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.616
And I remember thinking,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.496
"Come on, lady,
stop with the fancy French words

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.240
and just give me some white wine."

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.016
But I used my powers of deduction

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.456
and recognized that chardonnay
and sauvignon blanc

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.376
were two separate types of white wine,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.816
and so I told her
that I would take the chardonnay,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.698
because frankly that was
the easiest one to pronounce for me.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.056
So I had a lot of experiences like that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.760
during my first couple of years
as a law student at Yale,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.720
because, despite all outward appearances,
I'm a cultural outsider.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.816
I didn't come from the elites.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.176
I didn't come from the Northeast
or from San Francisco.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.296
I came from a southern Ohio steel town,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.056
and it's a town that's really
struggling in a lot of ways,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.536
ways that are indicative
of the broader struggles

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.000
of America's working class.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.056
Heroin has moved in,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.120
killing a lot of people, people I know.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.640
Family violence, domestic violence,
and divorce have torn apart families.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.576
And there's a very unique
sense of pessimism that's moved in.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.216
Think about rising mortality rates
in these communities

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.416
and recognize that
for a lot of these folks,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.016
the problems that they're seeing

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.736
are actually causing rising death rates
in their own communities,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.160
so there's a very real sense of struggle.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.696
I had a very front-row seat
to that struggle.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.840
My family has been part of that struggle
for a very long time.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.416
I come from a family
that doesn't have a whole lot of money.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.856
The addiction that plagued my community

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.000
also plagued my family,
and even, sadly, my own mom.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.896
There were a lot of problems
that I saw in my own family,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.776
problems caused sometimes
by a lack of money,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.136
problems caused sometimes by a lack
of access to resources and social capital

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.200
that really affected my life.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.176
If you had looked at my life
when I was 14 years old

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.256
and said, "Well, what's going
to happen to this kid?"

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.136
you would have concluded
that I would have struggled

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.680
with what academics call upward mobility.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.536
So upward mobility is an abstract term,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.296
but it strikes at something
that's very core

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.016
at the heart of the American Dream.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.256
It's the sense,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.056
and it measures whether kids like me

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.096
who grow up in poor communities
are going to live a better life,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.496
whether they're going to have a chance
to live a materially better existence,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.056
or whether they're going to stay
in the circumstances where they came from.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.496
And one of the things
we've learned, unfortunately,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.456
is that upward mobility isn't as high
as we'd like it to be in this country,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.480
and interestingly,
it's very geographically distributed.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.040
So take Utah, for instance.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.376
In Utah a poor kid is actually doing OK,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.536
very likely to live their share
and their part in the American Dream.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.416
But if you think of where I'm from,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.376
in the South, in Appalachia,
in southern Ohio,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.616
it's very unlikely
that kids like that will rise.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.896
The American Dream
in those parts of the country

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.960
is in a very real sense just a dream.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.160
So why is that happening?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.936
So one reason is obviously
economic or structural.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.496
So you think of these areas.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.136
They're beset by these
terrible economic trends,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.776
built around industries
like coal and steel

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.840
that make it harder
for folks to get ahead.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.896
That's certainly one problem.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.416
There's also the problem of brain drain,
where the really talented people,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.816
because they can't find
high-skilled work at home,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.096
end up moving elsewhere,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.136
so they don't build a business
or non-profit where they're from,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.136
they end up going elsewhere
and taking their talents with them.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.816
There are failing schools
in a lot of these communities,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.896
failing to give kids
the educational leg up

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.456
that really makes it possible for kids
to have opportunities later in life.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.016
These things are all important.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.456
I don't mean to discount
these structural barriers.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.816
But when I look back at my life
and my community,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.720
something else was going on,
something else mattered.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.120
It's difficult to quantify,
but it was no less real.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.776
So for starters, there was
a very real sense of hopelessness

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.576
in the community that I grew up in.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.736
There was a sense that kids had
that their choices didn't matter.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.416
No matter what happened,
no matter how hard they worked,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.536
no matter how hard
they tried to get ahead,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.200
nothing good would happen.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.216
So that's a tough feeling
to grow up around.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.416
That's a tough mindset to penetrate,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.720
and it leads sometimes
to very conspiratorial places.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.176
So let's just take one
political issue that's pretty hot,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.696
affirmative action.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.016
So depending on your politics,
you might think that affirmative action

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.416
is either a wise or an unwise way
to promote diversity in the workplace

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.736
or the classroom.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.776
But if you grow up in an area like this,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.536
you see affirmative action
as a tool to hold people like you back.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.816
That's especially true if you're
a member of the white working class.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.256
You see it as something
that isn't just about good or bad policy.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.976
You see it as something
that's actively conspiring,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.256
where people with political
and financial power

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.896
are working against you.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.840
And there are a lot of ways that you see
that conspiracy against you --

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.416
perceived, real, but it's there,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.080
and it warps expectations.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.256
So if you think about what do you do
when you grow up in that world,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.016
you can respond in a couple of ways.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.216
One, you can say,
"I'm not going to work hard,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.136
because no matter how hard I work,
it's not going to matter."

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.816
Another thing you might do is say,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.056
"Well, I'm not going to go
after the traditional markers of success,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.416
like a university education
or a prestigious job,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.336
because the people who care
about those things are unlike me.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.980
They're never going to let me in."

00:05:41.004 --> 00:05:43.481
When I got admitted to Yale,
a family member asked me

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:46.816
if I had pretended to be a liberal
to get by the admissions committee.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.616
Seriously.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.656
And it's obviously not the case
that there was a liberal box to check

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.176
on the application,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.856
but it speaks to a very real
insecurity in these places

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.256
that you have to pretend
to be somebody you're not

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.480
to get past these various social barriers.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.604
It's a very significant problem.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.056
Even if you don't give in
to that hopelessness,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.896
even if you think, let's say,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.536
that your choices matter
and you want to make the good choices,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.456
you want to do better
for yourself and for your family,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.656
it's sometimes hard
to even know what those choices are

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.776
when you grow up
in a community like I did.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.416
I didn't know, for example,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.680
that you had to go
to law school to be a lawyer.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.296
I didn't know that elite universities,
as research consistently tells us,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.096
are cheaper for low-income kids

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.696
because these universities
have bigger endowments,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.896
can offer more generous financial aid.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.176
I remember I learned this

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.016
when I got the financial aid letter
from Yale for myself,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.736
tens of thousands of dollars
in need-based aid,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.896
which is a term I had never heard before.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.576
But I turned to my aunt
when I got that letter and said,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.896
"You know, I think this just means
that for the first time in my life,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.520
being poor has paid really well."

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.176
So I didn't have access
to that information

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.856
because the social networks around me
didn't have access to that information.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.536
I learned from my community
how to shoot a gun, how to shoot it well.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.016
I learned how to make
a damn good biscuit recipe.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.200
The trick, by the way,
is frozen butter, not warm butter.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.976
But I didn't learn how to get ahead.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.576
I didn't learn how to make
the good decisions

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.456
about education and opportunity

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.176
that you need to make

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.376
to actually have a chance
in this 21st century knowledge economy.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.536
Economists call the value
that we gain from our informal networks,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.176
from our friends and colleagues
and family "social capital."

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.016
The social capital that I had
wasn't built for 21st century America,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.240
and it showed.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.296
There's something else
that's really important that's going on

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.496
that our community
doesn't like to talk about,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.096
but it's very real.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.016
Working-class kids are much more likely

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.776
to face what's called
adverse childhood experiences,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.520
which is just a fancy word
for childhood trauma:

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.856
getting hit or yelled at,
put down by a parent repeatedly,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.296
watching someone hit or beat your parent,

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.696
watching someone do drugs
or abuse alcohol.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.256
These are all instances
of childhood trauma,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.360
and they're pretty
commonplace in my family.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.376
Importantly, they're not just
commonplace in my family right now.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.416
They're also multigenerational.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.000
So my grandparents,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.416
the very first time that they had kids,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.136
they expected that they
were going to raise them in a way

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.776
that was uniquely good.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.056
They were middle class,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.461
they were able to earn
a good wage in a steel mill.

00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:28.816
But what ended up happening

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.856
is that they exposed their kids
to a lot of the childhood trauma

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.576
that had gone back many generations.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.360
My mom was 12 when she saw
my grandma set my grandfather on fire.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.936
His crime was that he came home drunk

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.176
after she told him,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.360
"If you come home drunk,
I'm gonna kill you."

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.440
And she tried to do it.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.920
Think about the way
that that affects a child's mind.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.456
And we think of these things
as especially rare,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.456
but a study by the Wisconsin
Children's Trust Fund found

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.160
that 40 percent of low-income kids face
multiple instances of childhood trauma,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.096
compared to only 29 percent
for upper-income kids.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.776
And think about what that really means.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.536
If you're a low-income kid,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.016
almost half of you face multiple
instances of childhood trauma.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.856
This is not an isolated problem.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.000
This is a very significant issue.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.920
We know what happens
to the kids who experience that life.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.216
They're more likely to do drugs,
more likely to go to jail,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.536
more likely to drop out of high school,

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.976
and most importantly,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.216
they're more likely
to do to their children

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.080
what their parents did to them.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.736
This trauma, this chaos in the home,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.216
is our culture's
very worst gift to our children,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.760
and it's a gift that keeps on giving.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.096
So you combine all that,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.816
the hopelessness, the despair,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.176
the cynicism about the future,

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.440
the childhood trauma,

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.336
the low social capital,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.656
and you begin to understand why me,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.256
at the age of 14,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.616
was ready to become
just another statistic,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.960
another kid who failed to beat the odds.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.336
But something unexpected happened.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.096
I did beat the odds.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.256
Things turned up for me.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.016
I graduated from high school,
from college, I went to law school,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.640
and I have a pretty good job now.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.520
So what happened?

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.856
Well, one thing that happened
is that my grandparents,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.416
the same grandparents
of setting someone on fire fame,

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.680
they really shaped up
by the time I came around.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.376
They provided me a stable home,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.696
a stable family.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.936
They made sure

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.096
that when my parents weren't able
to do the things that kids need,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.000
they stepped in and filled that role.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.536
My grandma especially
did two things that really matter.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.056
One, she provided that peaceful home
that allowed me to focus on homework

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.696
and the things that kids
should be focused on.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.096
But she was also
this incredibly perceptive woman,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.496
despite not even having
a middle school education.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.176
She recognized the message
that my community had for me,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.256
that my choices didn't matter,

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.096
that the deck was stacked against me.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.336
She once told me,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.336
"JD, never be like those losers who think
the deck is stacked against them.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.696
You can do anything you want to."

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.936
And yet she recognized
that life wasn't fair.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.576
It's hard to strike that balance,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.616
to tell a kid that life isn't fair,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.896
but also recognize and enforce in them
the reality that their choices matter.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.040
But mamaw was able
to strike that balance.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.336
The other thing that really helped
was the United States Marine Corps.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.856
So we think of the Marine Corps
as a military outfit, and of course it is,

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.736
but for me, the US Marine Corps
was a four-year crash course

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.976
in character education.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.376
It taught me how to make a bed,
how to do laundry,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.656
how to wake up early,
how to manage my finances.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.856
These are things
my community didn't teach me.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.833
I remember when I went
to go buy a car for the very first time,

00:11:49.857 --> 00:11:54.176
I was offered a dealer's
low, low interest rate of 21.9 percent,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.800
and I was ready
to sign on the dotted line.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.536
But I didn't take that deal,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.576
because I went and took it to my officer

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.736
who told me, "Stop being an idiot,

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.256
go to the local credit union,
and get a better deal."

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.736
And so that's what I did.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.176
But without the Marine Corps,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.456
I would have never had access
to that knowledge.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.680
I would have had
a financial calamity, frankly.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.856
The last thing I want to say
is that I had a lot of good fortune

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.456
in the mentors and people

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.616
who have played
an important role in my life.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.696
From the Marines,
from Ohio State, from Yale,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.976
from other places,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.656
people have really stepped in

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.496
and ensured that they filled
that social capital gap

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.920
that it was pretty obvious,
apparently, that I had.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.040
That comes from good fortune,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.136
but a lot of children
aren't going to have that good fortune,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.856
and I think that raises
really important questions for all of us

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.642
about how we're going to change that.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.576
We need to ask questions about
how we're going to give low-income kids

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.136
who come from a broken home
access to a loving home.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.416
We need to ask questions

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.776
about how we're going
to teach low-income parents

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.936
how to better interact
with their children,

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.456
with their partners.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.936
We need to ask questions
about how we give social capital,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.336
mentorship to low-income kids
who don't have it.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.416
We need to think about
how we teach working class children

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.936
about not just hard skills,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.056
like reading, mathematics,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.416
but also soft skills,

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.280
like conflict resolution
and financial management.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.656
Now, I don't have all of the answers.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.600
I don't know all of the solutions
to this problem,

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.560
but I do know this:

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.336
in southern Ohio right now,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.136
there's a kid who is
anxiously awaiting their dad,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.536
wondering whether,
when he comes through the door,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.960
he'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.200
There's a kid

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.896
whose mom sticks a needle in her arm

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.416
and passes out,

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.336
and he doesn't know
why she doesn't cook him dinner,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.160
and he goes to bed hungry that night.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.336
There's a kid who has
no hope for the future

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.616
but desperately
wants to live a better life.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.840
They just want somebody
to show it to them.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.536
I don't have all the answers,

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.496
but I know that unless our society
starts asking better questions

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.616
about why I was so lucky

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.696
and about how to get that luck
to more of our communities

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.376
and our country's children,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.656
we're going to continue
to have a very significant problem.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.896
Thank you.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.320
(Applause)
