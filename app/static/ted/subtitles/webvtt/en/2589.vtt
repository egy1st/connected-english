00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.423
This is the Bop.

00:00:03.014 --> 00:00:05.528
The Bop is a type of social dance.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.749
Dance is a language,

00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:14.592
and social dance is an expression
that emerges from a community.

00:00:15.238 --> 00:00:18.583
A social dance isn't choreographed
by any one person.

00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:21.172
It can't be traced to any one moment.

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:24.203
Each dance has steps
that everyone can agree on,

00:00:24.227 --> 00:00:27.793
but it's about the individual
and their creative identity.

00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:30.927
Because of that,

00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:32.343
social dances bubble up,

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:33.534
they change

00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:35.333
and they spread like wildfire.

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.678
They are as old as our remembered history.

00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:43.733
In African-American social dances,

00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:45.505
we see over 200 years

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:50.143
of how African and African-American
traditions influenced our history.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.841
The present always contains the past.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.877
And the past shapes who we are

00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:59.493
and who we will be.

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:01.860
(Clapping)

00:01:03.304 --> 00:01:06.451
The Juba dance was born
from enslaved Africans' experience

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:07.823
on the plantation.

00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:09.497
Brought to the Americas,

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:11.756
stripped of a common spoken language,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.052
this dance was a way for enslaved Africans
to remember where they're from.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.593
It may have looked something like this.

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:25.723
Slapping thighs,

00:01:25.747 --> 00:01:26.981
shuffling feet

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:28.805
and patting hands:

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.400
this was how they got around
the slave owners' ban on drumming,

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:35.077
improvising complex rhythms

00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:37.976
just like ancestors did
with drums in Haiti

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.648
or in the Yoruba communities
of West Africa.

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:47.921
It was about keeping
cultural traditions alive

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:50.278
and retaining a sense of inner freedom

00:01:50.302 --> 00:01:51.555
under captivity.

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:57.492
It was the same subversive spirit
that created this dance:

00:01:58.191 --> 00:01:59.361
the Cakewalk,

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:03.161
a dance that parodied the mannerisms
of Southern high society --

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:06.387
a way for the enslaved
to throw shade at the masters.

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:08.800
The crazy thing about this dance

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:11.761
is that the Cakewalk
was performed for the masters,

00:02:11.785 --> 00:02:14.616
who never suspected
they were being made fun of.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.197
Now you might recognize this one.

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:20.975
1920s --

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.454
the Charleston.

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:29.466
The Charleston was all about
improvisation and musicality,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.505
making its way into Lindy Hop,

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:32.689
swing dancing

00:02:32.713 --> 00:02:33.950
and even the Kid n Play,

00:02:33.974 --> 00:02:36.551
originally called the Funky Charleston.

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:45.222
Started by a tight-knit Black community
near Charleston, South Carolina,

00:02:45.246 --> 00:02:47.238
the Charleston permeated dance halls

00:02:47.262 --> 00:02:50.416
where young women suddenly had
the freedom to kick their heels

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.177
and move their legs.

00:02:57.273 --> 00:03:00.931
Now, social dance is about
community and connection;

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:02.309
if you knew the steps,

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:04.267
it meant you belonged to a group.

00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:06.855
But what if it becomes a worldwide craze?

00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:08.925
Enter the Twist.

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:13.256
It's no surprise that the Twist
can be traced back to the 19th century,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.177
brought to America from the Congo

00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:16.408
during slavery.

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:18.085
But in the late '50s,

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.183
right before the Civil Rights Movement,

00:03:20.207 --> 00:03:23.938
the Twist is popularized
by Chubby Checker and Dick Clark.

00:03:23.962 --> 00:03:26.533
Suddenly, everybody's doing the Twist:

00:03:26.557 --> 00:03:27.750
white teenagers,

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.361
kids in Latin America,

00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:32.092
making its way into songs and movies.

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:33.303
Through social dance,

00:03:33.327 --> 00:03:36.209
the boundaries between groups
become blurred.

00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:42.445
The story continues in the 1980s and '90s.

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:45.102
Along with the emergence of hip-hop,

00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:49.068
African-American social dance
took on even more visibility,

00:03:49.092 --> 00:03:51.318
borrowing from its long past,

00:03:51.342 --> 00:03:53.953
shaping culture and being shaped by it.

00:04:02.364 --> 00:04:07.011
Today, these dances continue
to evolve, grow and spread.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.535
Why do we dance?

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:10.728
To move,

00:04:10.752 --> 00:04:11.941
to let loose,

00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:13.340
to express.

00:04:13.364 --> 00:04:15.176
Why do we dance together?

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.359
To heal,

00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:17.534
to remember,

00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:20.056
to say: "We speak a common language.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.231
We exist

00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:22.732
and we are free."
