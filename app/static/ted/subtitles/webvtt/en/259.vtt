WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and actually all the way down into the sewer

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
because I want to talk about diarrhea.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And in particular, I want to talk about

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the design of diarrhea.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And when evolutionary biologists talk about design,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
they really mean design by natural selection.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And that brings me to the title of the talk,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
"Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But I'm not just doing this to be cute.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I really think that this subtitle explains

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
what somebody like me, who's sort of a Darwin wannabe,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
how they actually look at one's role in

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You actually see a great potential,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and may actually be very resistant, when one tries

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to introduce ideas.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So, all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
One is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And a very closely related question, which is,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
how can we take control of this situation once we understand

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the answer to the first question?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
How can we make the harmful organisms more mild?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And I'm going to be talking, to begin with, as I said,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
about diarrheal disease organisms.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that cause acute infectious disease,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
germ's-eye view.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And in particular, to think about a fundamental idea

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in the harmfulness of disease organisms.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
disease organisms have to get from one host to another,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to move them to another host.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But not always.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Sometimes, you get disease organisms

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that natural selection will favor the more exploitative,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
more predator-like organisms.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So, natural selection will favor organisms

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that are more likely to cause damage.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
then we expect that the winners of the competition

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
will be the milder organisms.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So, if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and actual selection favors pathogens

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
that take advantage of those hosts,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
for their own reproductive success.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
They can be transmitted from person-to-person contact,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
person-to-food-then-to-person contact,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
when somebody eats contaminated food,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
or they can be transmitted through the water.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And when they're transmitted through the water,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
unlike the first two modes of transmission,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens, even hundreds

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
of other individuals.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
To sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
if you've got a sick person in bed,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
They're going to wash those contaminated materials,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and then the water may move into sources of drinking water.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
People will come in to those places where you've got

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
contaminated drinking water,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
bring things back to the family,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
may drink right at that point.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
The whole point is that a person who can't move

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
can still infect many other individuals.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And so, the theory tells us that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
we expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And you can test these ideas.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and see whether or not the ones that tend to be

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
more transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And the answer is -- yep, they are.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
but the main point here is that --

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
(Laughter)

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
there's a lot of them here, I can tell --

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
the main point here is that those data points

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
all show a very strong, positive association between

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and how harmful they are,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
how much death they cause per untreated infection.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So this suggests we're on the right track.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But this, to me, suggests that we really need

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
to ask some additional questions.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
how can we use this knowledge

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to make disease organisms evolve to be mild?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Now, this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
you could cause disease organisms to shift from

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But it doesn't tell you how long.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I mean, if this would require thousands of years,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
But if it could occur in just a few years,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
then it might be a very important way to control

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
In other words, this suggests that we could

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
domesticate these organisms.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
We could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And so, as I was thinking about this, I focused on this organism,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And that is the species of organism that is responsible

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
for causing cholera.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
is that we understand why it's so harmful.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
It's harmful because it produces a toxin,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and that toxin is released when the organism

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
gets into our intestinal tract.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
into the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So what happens, if you've got an organism,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
it produces a lot of toxin.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
After a few days of infection you end up having --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It's sort of cloudy water.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And if you took a drop of that water,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
you might find a million diarrheal organisms.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
If the organism produced a lot of toxin,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
you might find 10 million, or 100 million.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
then you might find a smaller number.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So the task is to try to figure out

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
by person-to-person contact,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
or person-food-person contact --

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
both of which would really require that people be

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
mobile and fairly healthy for transmission.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Now, I can think of some possible experiments.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
some that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and take those strains and spew them out in different countries.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Some countries that might have clean water supplies,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
so that you can't get waterborne transmission:

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Other countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
there you expect these organisms to evolve

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
towards a high level of harmfulness, right?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
There's a little ethical problem in this experiment.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
That makes me worry a little bit.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
(Laughter)

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
But anyhow, the laughter makes me feel a little bit better.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And this ethical problem's a big problem.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Just to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Here's a girl who's almost dead.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
She got rehydration therapy, she perked up,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
within a few days she was looking like a completely different person.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So, we don't want to run an experiment like that.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
In 1991, this cholera organism got into Lima, Peru,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Now, I don't know how that happened,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I don't think anybody knows,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
but I'm not averse to, once that's happened,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
to see whether or not the prediction that we would make,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that I did make before, actually holds up.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
which has some of the most well protected water supplies

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
in Latin America?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
which has some of the least well protected?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And Peru's got something sort of in between.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And so, with funding from the Bosack-Kruger Foundation,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I got a lot of strains from these different countries

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and we measured their toxin production in the lab.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And we found that in Chile -- within two months of the invasion of Peru

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
you had strains entering Chile --

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and when you look at those strains,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
in the very far left-hand side of this graph,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
you see a lot of variation in the toxin production.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
a lot of variation on which natural selection can act.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But the interesting point is, if you look over the 1990s,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
They evolved to produce less toxin.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And to just give you a sense of how important this might be,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
if we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
on average, reported from Chile every two years.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So, it's controlled.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
That's how much we have in America,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
cholera that's acquired endemically,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and we don't think we've got a problem here.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
They didn't -- they solved the problem in Chile.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
But, before we get too confident, we'd better look at some of those other countries,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Well, in Peru it didn't.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And in Ecuador -- remember, this is the place where it has

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
the highest potential waterborne transmission --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
it looked like it got more harmful.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
In every case there's a lot of variation,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
but something about the environment the people are living in,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and I think the only realistic explanation is that it's

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the degree of waterborne transmission,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
favored the harmful strains in one place, and mild strains in another.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So, this is very encouraging,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
if we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It would make these organisms evolve to mildness,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
so that even though people might be getting infected,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
they'd be infected with mild strains.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
It wouldn't be causing severe disease.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
But there's another really interesting aspect of this,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
evolution of harmfulness,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And the idea is very simple.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
If you've got a harmful organism,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
so you get increased virulence leading to

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And once you get increased antibiotic resistance,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
So, you've got a higher level of virulence.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So, you get this vicious cycle.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
The goal is to turn this around.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
by cleaning up the water supply,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
in antibiotic resistance.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So, we can go to the same countries and look and see.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
If we look in the beginning of the 1990s,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
we see, again, a lot of variation.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
In this case, on the Y-axis, we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity --

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and I won't go into that.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
But we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Peru and Ecuador, and no trend across the years.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
But if we look at the end of the 1990s, just half a decade later,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Antibiotic sensitivity was going down.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And in Chile, you still had antibiotic sensitivity.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So, it looks like Chile dodged two bullets.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
They got the organism to evolve to mildness,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and they got no development of antibiotic resistance.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Now, these ideas should apply across the board,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And I want to give you just one more example,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
because we've talked a little bit about malaria.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And the example I want to deal with is,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
or the idea I want to deal with, the question is,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Now, malaria's transmitted by a mosquito,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and normally if you're infected with malaria, and you're feeling sick,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And you can show, just by looking at data from literature,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that vector-borne diseases are more harmful

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
than non-vector-borne diseases.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
But I think there's a really fascinating example

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
In the case of waterborne transmission,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
we'd like to clean up the water supplies,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
In the case of malaria, what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And the logic's a little more subtle here.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
If you mosquito-proof houses,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
when people get sick, they're sitting in bed --

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
or in mosquito-proof hospitals, they're sitting in a hospital bed --

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and the mosquitoes can't get to them.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So, if you're a harmful variant

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
in a place where you've got mosquito-proof housing, then you're a loser.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
The only pathogens that get transmitted

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
to walk outside and get mosquito bites.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So, if you were to mosquito proof houses,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And there's a really wonderful experiment that was done

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Just to give you a little perspective on this,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
which is right there in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And this really cool experiment was done

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
about 200 miles south of there, in Northern Alabama,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
by the Tennessee Valley Authority.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
They had dammed up the Tennessee River.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
They'd caused the water to back up,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
they needed electric, hydroelectric power.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And when you get stagnant water, you get mosquitoes.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
They found in the late '30s -- 10 years after they'd made these dams --

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
that the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
about a third to half of them were infected with malaria.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
This shows you the positions of some of these dams.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
OK, so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
There wasn't DDT, there wasn't chloroquines: what do they do?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Well, they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
So they did. They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and within three years, about 100 dollars per house,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
they mosquito proofed every house.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And these are the data.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Every row across here represents one of those 11 zones.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And the asterisks represent the time at which

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
the mosquito proofing was complete.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And so what you can see is that

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
just the mosquito-proofed housing, and nothing else,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
caused the eradication of malaria.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And this was, incidentally, published in 1949,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
in the leading textbook of malaria, called "Boyd's Malariology."

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
But almost no malaria experts even know it exists.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
This is important,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Now, I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Like, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
sub-Saharan Africa.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
But as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
you're certainly not going to eradicate.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So to me, it's an experiment that's waiting to happen,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and if it confirms the prediction, then

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
we should have a very powerful tool.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
In a way, much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
because most of what's being done today is

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
to rely on things like anti-malarial drugs.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And we know that, although it's great to make those

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
anti-malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
we know that when you make them highly available

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
you're going to get resistance to those drugs.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And so it's a short-term solution.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
This is a long-term solution.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
What I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
working in the direction we want it to go,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
for example with anti-malarial drugs.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
So, this table I've given just to emphasize

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
that I've only talked about two examples.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
But as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
for infectious diseases, and it ought to.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
We're dealing with living systems;

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
we're dealing with systems that evolve.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And so if you do something with those systems,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
they're going to evolve one way or another.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
so that -- we need to adjust our interventions

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
to get the most bang for the intervention buck,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So, I don't really have time to talk about those things,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
but I did want to put them up there,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
just to give you a sense that there really are solutions

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to controlling the evolution of harmfulness

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So, for example, earlier today there was discussion of,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
What this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
encourage people to stay more faithful to partners, and so on.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
But the key thing is to figure out how to lower it,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
because if we lower it, we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And the data really do support this:

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So the other thing I really like about this,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
into the study of control of disease,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
is that often the kinds of interventions that you want,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
that it indicates should be done,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
But people just haven't been able to justify the cost.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
So, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
then I think that we can say,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
let's push the effort into that aspect of the control,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
so that we can actually solve the problem,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
just by cleaning up water supply.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Anyhow, I'll end that there, and thank you very much.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
(Applause)
