00:00:00.827 --> 00:00:03.888
I was recently traveling
in the Highlands of New Guinea,

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:06.406
and I was talking with a man
who had three wives.

00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:09.994
I asked him, "How many wives
would you like to have?"

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.774
And there was this long pause,

00:00:11.798 --> 00:00:12.993
and I thought to myself,

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:14.568
"Is he going to say five?

00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:16.019
Is he going to say 10?

00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:17.885
Is he going to say 25?"

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:19.071
And he leaned towards me

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:20.605
and he whispered, "None."

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:22.809
(Laughter)

00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:27.889
Eighty-six percent of human societies
permit a man to have several wives:

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:29.064
polygyny.

00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:31.197
But in the vast majority
of these cultures,

00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:35.519
only about five or ten percent of men
actually do have several wives.

00:00:35.543 --> 00:00:37.890
Having several partners
can be a toothache.

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:41.034
In fact, co-wives can
fight with each other,

00:00:41.058 --> 00:00:43.995
sometimes they can even poison
each other's children.

00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:47.106
And you've got to have
a lot of cows, a lot of goats,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.095
a lot of money, a lot of land,

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:50.655
in order to build a harem.

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:53.392
We are a pair-bonding species.

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:56.954
Ninety-seven percent of mammals
do not pair up to rear their young;

00:00:56.978 --> 00:00:58.806
human beings do.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.980
I'm not suggesting that we're not --

00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:04.151
that we're necessarily
sexually faithful to our partners.

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:06.923
I've looked at adultery in 42 cultures,

00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:09.382
I understand, actually,
some of the genetics of it,

00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:11.254
and some of the brain circuitry of it.

00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:13.221
It's very common around the world,

00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:15.182
but we are built to love.

00:01:15.716 --> 00:01:19.032
How is technology changing love?

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:21.987
I'm going to say almost not at all.

00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:24.098
I study the brain.

00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:27.852
I and my colleagues have put
over 100 people into a brain scanner --

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:30.883
people who had just
fallen happily in love,

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:32.938
people who had just been rejected in love

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:34.835
and people who are in love long-term.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:38.046
And it is possible
to remain "in love" long-term.

00:01:38.543 --> 00:01:40.449
And I've long ago maintained

00:01:40.473 --> 00:01:43.498
that we've evolved three distinctly
different brain systems

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:45.359
for mating and reproduction:

00:01:45.383 --> 00:01:46.535
sex drive,

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:48.495
feelings of intense romantic love

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:52.265
and feelings of deep cosmic
attachment to a long-term partner.

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.725
And together, these three brain systems --

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.237
with many other parts of the brain --

00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:02.387
orchestrate our sexual,
our romantic and our family lives.

00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:04.804
But they lie way below the cortex,

00:02:04.828 --> 00:02:09.049
way below the limbic system
where we feel our emotions,

00:02:09.073 --> 00:02:10.360
generate our emotions.

00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:15.199
They lie in the most primitive parts
of the brain, linked with energy,

00:02:15.223 --> 00:02:20.479
focus, craving, motivation,
wanting and drive.

00:02:20.503 --> 00:02:21.656
In this case,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.211
the drive to win life's greatest prize:

00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:25.669
a mating partner.

00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:30.210
They evolved over 4.4 million years ago
among our first ancestors,

00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:34.696
and they're not going to change
if you swipe left or right on Tinder.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.267
(Laughter)

00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.737
(Applause)

00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:43.376
There's no question that technology
is changing the way we court:

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.324
emailing, texting,

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:47.323
emojis to express your emotions,

00:02:47.347 --> 00:02:48.611
sexting,

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:51.071
"liking" a photograph, selfies ...

00:02:51.095 --> 00:02:55.207
We're seeing new rules
and taboos for how to court.

00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:57.923
But, you know --

00:02:57.947 --> 00:03:01.091
is this actually
dramatically changing love?

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.094
What about the late 1940s,

00:03:04.118 --> 00:03:06.679
when the automobile became very popular

00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:09.049
and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms?

00:03:09.073 --> 00:03:10.791
(Laughter)

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:15.053
How about the introduction
of the birth control pill?

00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:20.788
Unchained from the great threat
of pregnancy and social ruin,

00:03:20.812 --> 00:03:25.236
women could finally express
their primitive and primal sexuality.

00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:28.741
Even dating sites are not changing love.

00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:31.323
I'm Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com,

00:03:31.347 --> 00:03:33.027
I've been it for 11 years.

00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:35.055
I keep telling them
and they agree with me,

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.618
that these are not dating sites,

00:03:36.642 --> 00:03:38.655
they are introducing sites.

00:03:39.017 --> 00:03:41.280
When you sit down in a bar,

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:42.888
in a coffee house,

00:03:42.912 --> 00:03:44.268
on a park bench,

00:03:44.292 --> 00:03:49.297
your ancient brain snaps into action
like a sleeping cat awakened,

00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:50.620
and you smile

00:03:50.644 --> 00:03:51.802
and laugh

00:03:51.826 --> 00:03:53.008
and listen

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:57.905
and parade the way our ancestors
did 100,000 years ago.

00:03:58.424 --> 00:04:00.377
We can give you various people --

00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:01.966
all the dating sites can --

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.903
but the only real algorithm
is your own human brain.

00:04:05.927 --> 00:04:08.499
Technology is not going to change that.

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:13.685
Technology is also not going to change
who you choose to love.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.405
I study the biology of personality,

00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:17.641
and I've come to believe

00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:21.948
that we've evolved four very broad
styles of thinking and behaving,

00:04:21.972 --> 00:04:23.802
linked with the dopamine, serotonin,

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:26.004
testosterone and estrogen systems.

00:04:26.358 --> 00:04:30.511
So I created a questionnaire
directly from brain science

00:04:30.535 --> 00:04:33.677
to measure the degree to which
you express the traits --

00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:35.455
the constellation of traits --

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.487
linked with each
of these four brain systems.

00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:43.697
I then put that questionnaire
on various dating sites

00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:45.363
in 40 countries.

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.859
Fourteen million or more people
have now taken the questionnaire,

00:04:49.883 --> 00:04:53.808
and I've been able to watch
who's naturally drawn to whom.

00:04:54.462 --> 00:04:55.973
And as it turns out,

00:04:55.997 --> 00:04:58.566
those who were very expressive
of the dopamine system

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.725
tend to be curious, creative,
spontaneous, energetic --

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:05.200
I would imagine there's an awful lot
of people like that in this room --

00:05:05.224 --> 00:05:07.152
they're drawn to people like themselves.

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:10.559
Curious, creative people
need people like themselves.

00:05:10.583 --> 00:05:13.221
People who are very expressive
of the serotonin system

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:16.124
tend to be traditional, conventional,
they follow the rules,

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:18.026
they respect authority,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.436
they tend to be religious -- religiosity
is in the serotonin system --

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.797
and traditional people
go for traditional people.

00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:27.485
In that way, similarity attracts.

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.731
In the other two cases, opposites attract.

00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:32.052
People very expressive
of the testosterone system

00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:35.999
tend to be analytical,
logical, direct, decisive,

00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:37.505
and they go for their opposite:

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.782
they go for somebody who's high estrogen,

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:42.048
somebody who's got very good verbal skills

00:05:42.072 --> 00:05:43.314
and people skills,

00:05:43.338 --> 00:05:44.786
who's very intuitive

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.123
and who's very nurturing
and emotionally expressive.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:51.091
We have natural patterns of mate choice.

00:05:51.468 --> 00:05:56.524
Modern technology is not going
to change who we choose to love.

00:05:57.488 --> 00:06:00.041
But technology is producing
one modern trend

00:06:00.065 --> 00:06:01.801
that I find particularly important.

00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:05.839
It's associated with the concept
of paradox of choice.

00:06:06.372 --> 00:06:07.826
For millions of years,

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.117
we lived in little hunting
and gathering groups.

00:06:10.141 --> 00:06:12.667
You didn't have the opportunity to choose

00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:15.801
between 1,000 people on a dating site.

00:06:16.261 --> 00:06:18.318
In fact, I've been studying this recently,

00:06:18.342 --> 00:06:21.497
and I actually think there's some
sort of sweet spot in the brain;

00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:25.472
I don't know what it is, but apparently,
from reading a lot of the data,

00:06:25.496 --> 00:06:30.647
we can embrace about five
to nine alternatives, and after that,

00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:33.891
you get into what academics
call "cognitive overload,"

00:06:33.915 --> 00:06:35.716
and you don't choose any.

00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:39.321
So I've come to think that due
to this cognitive overload,

00:06:39.345 --> 00:06:42.656
we're ushering in a new form of courtship

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.625
that I call "slow love."

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:48.766
I arrived at this during
my work with Match.com.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.081
Every year for the last six years,

00:06:51.105 --> 00:06:53.798
we've done a study called
"Singles in America."

00:06:53.822 --> 00:06:55.630
We don't poll the Match population,

00:06:55.654 --> 00:06:57.614
we poll the American population.

00:06:57.638 --> 00:07:00.607
We use 5,000-plus people,

00:07:00.631 --> 00:07:04.528
a representative sample of Americans
based on the US census.

00:07:04.552 --> 00:07:07.444
We've got data now on over 30,000 people,

00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:09.935
and every single year,

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.485
I see some of the same patterns.

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.288
Every single year when I ask the question,

00:07:15.312 --> 00:07:18.075
over 50 percent of people
have had a one-night stand --

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:20.766
not necessarily last year,
but in their lives --

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.063
50 percent have had
a friends with benefits

00:07:23.087 --> 00:07:24.694
during the course of their lives,

00:07:24.718 --> 00:07:28.286
and over 50 percent have lived
with a person long-term

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.746
before marrying.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.972
Americans think that this is reckless.

00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:34.915
I have doubted that for a long time;

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:36.831
the patterns are too strong.

00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:39.583
There's got to be some
Darwinian explanation --

00:07:39.607 --> 00:07:41.933
Not that many people are crazy.

00:07:41.957 --> 00:07:45.845
And I stumbled, then, on a statistic
that really came home to me.

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:48.866
It was a very interesting academic article

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.903
in which I found that 67 percent
of singles in America today

00:07:53.927 --> 00:07:56.341
who are living long-term with somebody,

00:07:56.365 --> 00:08:00.452
have not yet married because
they are terrified of divorce.

00:08:00.476 --> 00:08:02.332
They're terrified of the social,

00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:03.889
legal, emotional,

00:08:03.913 --> 00:08:06.782
economic consequences of divorce.

00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:10.564
So I came to realize that I don't think
this is recklessness;

00:08:10.588 --> 00:08:12.264
I think it's caution.

00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:17.813
Today's singles want to know
every single thing about a partner

00:08:17.837 --> 00:08:19.466
before they wed.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.419
You learn a lot between the sheets,

00:08:21.443 --> 00:08:23.955
not only about how somebody makes love,

00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:25.349
but whether they're kind,

00:08:25.373 --> 00:08:26.715
whether they can listen

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:27.911
and at my age,

00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:29.713
whether they've got a sense of humor.

00:08:29.737 --> 00:08:31.140
(Laughter)

00:08:31.164 --> 00:08:34.618
And in an age where we have
too many choices,

00:08:35.075 --> 00:08:38.337
we have very little fear
of pregnancy and disease

00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:42.069
and we've got no feeling of shame
for sex before marriage,

00:08:42.093 --> 00:08:45.791
I think people are taking
their time to love.

00:08:46.408 --> 00:08:48.059
And actually, what's happening is,

00:08:48.083 --> 00:08:51.944
what we're seeing is a real expansion
of the precommitment stage

00:08:51.968 --> 00:08:53.704
before you tie the knot.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.760
Where marriage used to be
the beginning of a relationship,

00:08:56.784 --> 00:08:58.453
now it's the finale.

00:08:59.413 --> 00:09:01.153
But the human brain --

00:09:01.177 --> 00:09:03.186
(Laughter)

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.024
The human brain always triumphs,

00:09:05.048 --> 00:09:06.943
and indeed, in the United States today,

00:09:06.967 --> 00:09:10.465
86 percent of Americans
will marry by age 49.

00:09:10.489 --> 00:09:14.035
And even in cultures around the world
where they're not marrying as often,

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:17.334
they are settling down eventually
with a long-term partner.

00:09:17.358 --> 00:09:19.193
So it began to occur to me:

00:09:19.217 --> 00:09:23.784
during this long extension
of the precommitment stage,

00:09:23.808 --> 00:09:26.981
if you can get rid of bad
relationships before you marry,

00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:29.452
maybe we're going to see
more happy marriages.

00:09:29.838 --> 00:09:34.713
So I did a study of 1,100
married people in America --

00:09:34.737 --> 00:09:36.464
not on Match.com, of course --

00:09:36.488 --> 00:09:38.604
and I asked them a lot of questions.

00:09:38.628 --> 00:09:40.135
But one of the questions was,

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:44.731
"Would you re-marry the person
you're currently married to?"

00:09:44.755 --> 00:09:47.620
And 81 percent said, "Yes."

00:09:48.613 --> 00:09:55.092
In fact, the greatest change
in modern romance and family life

00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:56.516
is not technology.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.564
It's not even slow love.

00:09:59.047 --> 00:10:01.998
It's actually women
piling into the job market

00:10:02.022 --> 00:10:03.445
in cultures around the world.

00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:04.996
For millions of years,

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.990
our ancestors lived
in little hunting and gathering groups.

00:10:08.014 --> 00:10:10.919
Women commuted to work
to gather their fruits and vegetables.

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:14.453
They came home with 60 to 80
percent of the evening meal.

00:10:14.477 --> 00:10:17.170
The double-income family was the rule.

00:10:17.194 --> 00:10:21.135
And women were regarded
as just as economically, socially

00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:24.274
and sexually powerful as men.

00:10:24.298 --> 00:10:27.400
Then the environment changed
some 10,000 years ago,

00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:29.653
we began to settle down on the farm

00:10:29.677 --> 00:10:32.868
and both men and women
became obliged, really,

00:10:32.892 --> 00:10:34.464
to marry the right person,

00:10:34.488 --> 00:10:35.918
from the right background,

00:10:35.942 --> 00:10:37.245
from the right religion

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:40.807
and from the right kin
and social and political connections.

00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:42.425
Men's jobs became more important:

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:45.186
they had to move the rocks,
fell the trees, plow the land.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.134
They brought the produce
to local markets, and came home

00:10:48.158 --> 00:10:49.672
with the equivalent of money.

00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:51.242
Along with this,

00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:54.243
we see a rise of a host of beliefs:

00:10:54.267 --> 00:10:56.449
the belief of virginity at marriage,

00:10:56.473 --> 00:10:59.416
arranged marriages --
strictly arranged marriages --

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.967
the belief that the man
is the head of the household,

00:11:01.991 --> 00:11:04.230
that the wife's place is in the home

00:11:04.254 --> 00:11:05.407
and most important,

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:08.562
honor thy husband,
and 'til death do us part.

00:11:08.586 --> 00:11:10.308
These are gone.

00:11:10.332 --> 00:11:12.881
They are going, and in many places,

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.293
they are gone.

00:11:14.317 --> 00:11:17.740
We are right now in a marriage revolution.

00:11:17.764 --> 00:11:22.479
We are shedding 10,000 years
of our farming tradition

00:11:22.503 --> 00:11:28.129
and moving forward towards egalitarian
relationships between the sexes --

00:11:28.153 --> 00:11:32.968
something I regard as highly compatible
with the ancient human spirit.

00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:35.264
I'm not a Pollyanna;

00:11:35.288 --> 00:11:37.049
there's a great deal to cry about.

00:11:37.073 --> 00:11:38.819
I've studied divorce in 80 cultures,

00:11:38.843 --> 00:11:40.979
I've studied, as I say,
adultery in many --

00:11:41.003 --> 00:11:42.819
there's a whole pile of problems.

00:11:42.843 --> 00:11:46.035
As William Butler Yeats,
the poet, once said,

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:48.524
"Love is the crooked thing."

00:11:49.131 --> 00:11:51.921
I would add, "Nobody gets out alive."

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:53.040
(Laughter)

00:11:53.064 --> 00:11:54.531
We all have problems.

00:11:54.925 --> 00:11:58.529
But in fact, I think the poet
Randall Jarrell really sums it up best.

00:11:58.553 --> 00:12:03.552
He said, "The dark, uneasy world
of family life --

00:12:03.576 --> 00:12:08.094
where the greatest can fail,
and the humblest succeed."

00:12:08.779 --> 00:12:10.666
But I will leave you with this:

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.418
love and attachment will prevail,

00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:15.975
technology cannot change it.

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:17.837
And I will conclude by saying

00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:23.107
any understanding of human relationships
must take into account

00:12:23.131 --> 00:12:27.356
one the most powerful determinants
of human behavior:

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.598
the unquenchable,

00:12:29.217 --> 00:12:30.382
adaptable

00:12:30.789 --> 00:12:33.795
and primordial human drive to love.

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:34.971
Thank you.

00:12:34.995 --> 00:12:38.017
(Applause)

00:12:39.915 --> 00:12:42.296
Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you
so much for that, Helen.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.629
As you know, there's another
speaker here with us

00:12:44.653 --> 00:12:46.203
that works in your same field.

00:12:46.227 --> 00:12:48.658
She comes at it
from a different perspective.

00:12:48.682 --> 00:12:53.319
Esther Perel is a psychotherapist
who works with couples.

00:12:53.749 --> 00:12:55.042
You study data,

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:57.566
Esther studies the stories
the couples tell her

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.618
when they come to her for help.

00:12:59.642 --> 00:13:01.366
Let's have her join us on the stage.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.541
Esther?

00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:05.696
(Applause)

00:13:10.249 --> 00:13:11.495
So Esther,

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:13.791
when you were watching Helen's talk,

00:13:13.815 --> 00:13:15.021
was there any part of it

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:17.812
that resonated with you
through the lens of your own work

00:13:17.836 --> 00:13:19.421
that you'd like to comment on?

00:13:20.062 --> 00:13:23.641
Esther Perel: It's interesting,
because on the one hand,

00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:27.494
the need for love
is ubiquitous and universal.

00:13:27.965 --> 00:13:29.929
But the way we love --

00:13:29.953 --> 00:13:31.483
the meaning we make out of it --

00:13:31.507 --> 00:13:33.832
the rules that govern
our relationships, I think,

00:13:33.856 --> 00:13:35.883
are changing fundamentally.

00:13:35.907 --> 00:13:38.807
We come from a model that, until now,

00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:42.294
was primarily regulated
around duty and obligation,

00:13:42.318 --> 00:13:44.715
the needs of the collective and loyalty.

00:13:44.739 --> 00:13:45.919
And we have shifted it

00:13:45.943 --> 00:13:50.273
to a model of free choice
and individual rights,

00:13:50.297 --> 00:13:53.373
and self-fulfillment and happiness.

00:13:53.397 --> 00:13:55.717
And so, that was
the first thing I thought,

00:13:55.741 --> 00:13:57.509
that the need doesn't change,

00:13:57.533 --> 00:14:01.341
but the context and the way
we regulate these relationships

00:14:01.365 --> 00:14:02.643
changes a lot.

00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:04.507
On the paradox of choice --

00:14:06.682 --> 00:14:09.009
you know, on the one hand
we relish the novelty

00:14:09.033 --> 00:14:10.625
and the playfulness, I think,

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:13.360
to be able to have so many options.

00:14:13.384 --> 00:14:14.745
And at the same time,

00:14:14.769 --> 00:14:17.183
as you talk about this cognitive overload,

00:14:17.207 --> 00:14:20.655
I see many, many people who ...

00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:26.497
who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt

00:14:26.521 --> 00:14:29.070
that comes with this massa of choice,

00:14:29.094 --> 00:14:31.353
creating a case of "FOMO"

00:14:31.377 --> 00:14:33.019
and then leading us --

00:14:33.043 --> 00:14:36.358
FOMO, fear of missed opportunity,
or fear of missing out --

00:14:36.382 --> 00:14:39.340
it's like, "How do I know
I have found 'the one' --

00:14:39.364 --> 00:14:40.536
the right one?"

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.243
So we've created what I call
this thing of "stable ambiguity."

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.305
Stable ambiguity is when
you are too afraid to be alone

00:14:48.329 --> 00:14:52.364
but also not really willing
to engage in intimacy-building.

00:14:52.388 --> 00:14:57.682
It's a set of tactics that kind of prolong
the uncertainty of a relationship

00:14:57.706 --> 00:15:00.313
but also the uncertainty of the breakup.

00:15:00.337 --> 00:15:03.319
So, here on the internet
you have three major ones.

00:15:03.343 --> 00:15:05.664
One is icing and simmering,

00:15:05.688 --> 00:15:08.563
which are great stalling tactics

00:15:08.587 --> 00:15:11.064
that offer a kind of holding pattern

00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:14.882
that emphasizes the undefined
nature of a relationship

00:15:14.906 --> 00:15:19.013
but at the same time gives you
enough of a comforting consistency

00:15:19.037 --> 00:15:21.794
and enough freedom
of the undefined boundaries.

00:15:21.818 --> 00:15:23.644
(Laughter)

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.240
Yeah?

00:15:25.264 --> 00:15:26.812
And then comes ghosting.

00:15:26.836 --> 00:15:28.808
And ghosting is, basically,

00:15:28.832 --> 00:15:33.352
you disappear from this massa
of texts on the spot,

00:15:33.376 --> 00:15:37.161
and you don't have to deal with
the pain that you inflict on another,

00:15:37.185 --> 00:15:39.783
because you're making it
invisible even to yourself.

00:15:39.807 --> 00:15:40.994
(Laughter)

00:15:41.018 --> 00:15:42.176
Yeah?

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.937
So I was thinking -- these words came up
for me as I was listening to you,

00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:52.124
like how a vocabulary
also creates a reality,

00:15:52.148 --> 00:15:53.703
and at the same time,

00:15:53.727 --> 00:15:55.411
that's my question to you:

00:15:55.435 --> 00:15:58.375
Do you think when the context changes,

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:02.039
it still means that the nature
of love remains the same?

00:16:02.063 --> 00:16:06.161
You study the brain and I study
people's relationships and stories,

00:16:06.185 --> 00:16:10.171
so I think it's everything you say, plus.

00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:14.593
But I don't always know the degree
to which a changing context ...

00:16:15.451 --> 00:16:17.981
Does it at some point begin to change --

00:16:18.005 --> 00:16:20.618
If the meaning changes,
does it change the need,

00:16:20.642 --> 00:16:23.105
or is the need clear
of the entire context?

00:16:23.797 --> 00:16:25.217
HF: Wow! Well --

00:16:25.241 --> 00:16:27.672
(Laughter)

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:30.871
(Applause)

00:16:30.895 --> 00:16:33.863
Well, I've got three points here, right?

00:16:34.736 --> 00:16:36.562
First of all, to your first one:

00:16:36.586 --> 00:16:40.179
there's no question that we've changed,
that we now want a person to love,

00:16:40.203 --> 00:16:43.048
and for thousands of years,
we had to marry the right person

00:16:43.072 --> 00:16:45.463
from the right background
and right kin connection.

00:16:45.497 --> 00:16:48.718
And in fact, in my studies
of 5,000 people every year,

00:16:48.742 --> 00:16:50.868
I ask them, "What are you looking for?"

00:16:50.892 --> 00:16:53.650
And every single year,
over 97 percent say --

00:16:53.674 --> 00:16:54.884
EP: The list grows --

00:16:54.908 --> 00:16:56.068
HF: Well, no.

00:16:56.092 --> 00:16:59.415
The basic thing is
over 97 percent of people

00:16:59.439 --> 00:17:01.530
want somebody that respects them,

00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:03.842
somebody they can trust and confide in,

00:17:03.866 --> 00:17:05.522
somebody who makes them laugh,

00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:07.428
somebody who makes enough time for them

00:17:07.452 --> 00:17:11.449
and somebody who they find
physically attractive.

00:17:11.473 --> 00:17:12.756
That never changes.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.958
And there's certainly -- you know,
there's two parts --

00:17:15.982 --> 00:17:17.562
EP: But you know how I call that?

00:17:17.586 --> 00:17:19.836
That's not what people used to say --

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.090
HF: That's exactly right.

00:17:21.114 --> 00:17:24.413
EP: They said they wanted somebody
with whom they have companionship,

00:17:24.437 --> 00:17:25.728
economic support, children.

00:17:25.752 --> 00:17:28.338
We went from a production economy
to a service economy.

00:17:28.362 --> 00:17:29.371
(Laughter)

00:17:29.395 --> 00:17:32.376
We did it in the larger culture,
and we're doing it in marriage.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.948
HF: Right, no question about it.

00:17:33.972 --> 00:17:37.882
But it's interesting, the millennials
actually want to be very good parents,

00:17:37.906 --> 00:17:42.026
whereas the generation above them
wants to have a very fine marriage

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.272
but is not as focused
on being a good parent.

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.379
You see all of these nuances.

00:17:46.403 --> 00:17:48.959
There's two basic parts of personality:

00:17:48.983 --> 00:17:52.558
there's your culture -- everything you
grew up to do and believe and say --

00:17:52.582 --> 00:17:53.981
and there's your temperament.

00:17:54.005 --> 00:17:56.832
Basically, what I've been talking
about is your temperament.

00:17:56.856 --> 00:18:00.174
And that temperament is certainly
going to change with changing times

00:18:00.198 --> 00:18:01.499
and changing beliefs.

00:18:01.891 --> 00:18:05.038
And in terms of the paradox of choice,

00:18:05.062 --> 00:18:07.469
there's no question about it
that this is a pickle.

00:18:07.493 --> 00:18:10.357
There were millions of years
where you found that sweet boy

00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:12.106
at the other side of the water hole,

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.281
and you went for it.

00:18:13.305 --> 00:18:14.456
EP: Yes, but you --

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.227
HF: I do want to say one more thing.

00:18:16.251 --> 00:18:18.868
The bottom line is, in hunting
and gathering societies,

00:18:18.892 --> 00:18:22.490
they tended to have two or three partners
during the course of their lives.

00:18:22.514 --> 00:18:23.672
They weren't square!

00:18:23.696 --> 00:18:25.352
And I'm not suggesting that we do,

00:18:25.376 --> 00:18:29.352
but the bottom line is,
we've always had alternatives.

00:18:29.376 --> 00:18:30.855
Mankind is always --

00:18:30.879 --> 00:18:34.071
in fact, the brain is well-built
to what we call "equilibrate,"

00:18:34.095 --> 00:18:35.246
to try and decide:

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.704
Do I come, do I stay? Do I go, do I stay?

00:18:37.728 --> 00:18:39.276
What are the opportunities here?

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.602
How do I handle this there?

00:18:40.626 --> 00:18:43.587
And so I think we're seeing
another play-out of that now.

00:18:44.052 --> 00:18:45.675
KS: Well, thank you both so much.

00:18:45.699 --> 00:18:48.905
I think you're going to have
a million dinner partners for tonight!

00:18:48.929 --> 00:18:50.908
(Applause)

00:18:50.932 --> 00:18:52.113
Thank you, thank you.
