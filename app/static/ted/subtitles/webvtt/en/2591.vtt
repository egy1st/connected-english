WEBVTT

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.160
I'd like you to imagine the world anew.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.016
I'd like to show you some maps,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.776
which have been drawn by Ben Hennig,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.496
of the planet in a way

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.600
that most of you will never
have seen the planet depicted before.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.560
Here's an image
that you're very familiar with.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.536
I'm old enough that I was actually born
before we saw this image.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.136
Apparently some of my first words
were "moona, moona,"

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.256
but I think that's my mom
having a particular fantasy

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.536
about what her baby boy could see

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.840
on the flickering
black and white TV screen.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.296
It's only been a few centuries

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.560
since we've actually, most of us,
thought of our planet as spherical.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.216
When we first saw
these images in the 1960s,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.520
the world was changing
at an incredible rate.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.640
In my own little discipline
of human geography,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.336
a cartographer called Waldo Tobler

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.896
was drawing new maps of the planet,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.416
and these maps have now spread,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.447
and I'm going to show you one of them now.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.680
This map is a map of the world,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.136
but it's a map which looks to you

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.600
a little bit strange.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.016
It's a map in which we stretched places,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.736
so that those areas which contain
many people are drawn larger,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.696
and those areas,
like the Sahara and the Himalayas,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.200
in which there are few people,
have been shrunk away.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.400
Everybody on the planet
is given an equal amount of space.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.960
The cities are shown shining bright.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.256
The lines are showing you
submarine cables and trade routes.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.936
And there's one particular line
that goes from the Chinese port of Dalian

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.656
through past Singapore,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.416
through the Suez Canal,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.776
through the Mediterranean
and round to Rotterdam.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.296
And it's showing you the route

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.256
of what was the world's
largest ship just a year ago,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.296
a ship which was taking
so many containers of goods

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.176
that when they were unloaded,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.440
if the lorries had all gone in convoy,
they would have been 100 kilometers long.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.416
This is how our world is now connected.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.416
This is the quantity of stuff
we are now moving around the world,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.176
just on one ship, on one voyage,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.400
in five weeks.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.840
We've lived in cities
for a very long time,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.856
but most of us didn't live in cities.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.016
This is Çatalhöyük,
one of the world's first cities.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.280
At its peak 9,000 years ago,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.360
people had to walk over the roofs
of others' houses to get to their home.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.376
If you look carefully
at the map of the city,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.320
you'll see it has no streets,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.960
because streets are something we invented.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.976
The world changes.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.880
It changes by trial and error.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.296
We work out slowly and gradually

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.120
how to live in better ways.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.480
And the world has changed
incredibly quickly most recently.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.536
It's only within the last six,
seven, or eight generations

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.640
that we have actually realized
that we are a species.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.400
It's only within the last few decades

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.000
that a map like this could be drawn.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.440
Again, the underlying map
is the map of world population,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.216
but over it, you're seeing arrows
showing how we spread out of Africa

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.016
with dates showing you
where we think we arrived

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.800
at particular times.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.536
I have to redraw this map
every few months,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.536
because somebody makes a discovery
that a particular date was wrong.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.080
We are learning about ourselves
at an incredible speed.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.800
And we're changing.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.896
A lot of change is gradual.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.416
It's accretion.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.296
We don't notice the change

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.136
because we only have short lives,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.760
70, 80, if you're lucky 90 years.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.576
This graph is showing you

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.320
the annual rate of population
growth in the world.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.056
It was very low until around about 1850,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.696
and then the rate of population growth

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.960
began to rise

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.856
so that around the time I was born,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.600
when we first saw those images
from the moon of our planet,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.000
our global population
was growing at two percent a year.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.400
If it had carried on growing
at two percent a year

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.440
for just another couple of centuries,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.816
the entire planet would be covered

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.896
with a seething mass of human bodies

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.960
all touching each other.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.816
And people were scared.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.656
They were scared of population growth

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.016
and what they called
"the population bomb" in 1968.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.240
But then, if you look
at the end of the graph,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.840
the growth began to slow.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.096
The decade --

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.576
the '70s, the '80s,
the '90s, the noughties,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.840
and in this decade, even faster --

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.216
our population growth is slowing.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.496
Our planet is stabilizing.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.536
We are heading towards nine,
10, or 11 billion people

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.800
by the end of the century.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.736
Within that change, you can see tumult.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.576
You can see the Second World War.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.776
You can see the pandemic
in 1918 from influenza.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.680
You can see the great Chinese famine.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.696
These are the events
we tend to concentrate on.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.656
We tend to concentrate
on the terrible events in the news.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.336
We don't tend to concentrate
on the gradual change

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.000
and the good news stories.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.176
We worry about people.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.456
We worry about how many people there are.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.640
We worry about how you can
get away from people.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.600
But this is the map of the world
changed again to make area large,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.136
the further away
people are from each area.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.096
So if you want to know
where to go to get away from everybody,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.696
here's the best places to go.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.536
And every year, these areas get bigger,

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.816
because every year,
we are coming off the land globally.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.296
We are moving into the cities.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.496
We are packing in more densely.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.136
There are wolves again in Europe,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.080
and the wolves are moving west
across the continent.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.600
Our world is changing.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.240
You have worries.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.576
This is a map showing
where the water falls on our planet.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.296
We now know that.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.096
And you can look at where Çatalhöyük was,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.696
where three continents meet,
Africa, Asia, and Europe,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.696
and you can see there are
a large number of people living there

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.296
in areas with very little water.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.016
And you can see areas in which
there is a great deal of rainfall as well.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.200
And we can get a bit more sophisticated.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.816
Instead of making
the map be shaped by people,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.056
we can shape the map by water,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.936
and then we can change it every month

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.616
to show the amount of water

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.840
falling on every small part of the globe.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.216
And you see the monsoons
moving around the planet,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.840
and the planet almost appears
to have a heartbeat.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.240
And all of this only became possible

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.696
within my lifetime

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.880
to see this is where we are living.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.840
We have enough water.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.120
This is a map of where
we grow our food in the world.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.720
This is the areas that we will rely on
most for rice and maize and corn.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.616
People worry that there won't
be enough food, but we know,

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.416
if we just ate less meat
and fed less of the crops to animals,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.856
there is enough food for everybody

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.200
as long as we think of ourselves
as one group of people.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.400
And we also know

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.336
about what we do

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.920
so terribly badly nowadays.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.320
You will have seen this map
of the world before.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.416
This is the map

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.816
produced by taking satellite images,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.616
if you remember those satellites
around the planet

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.400
in the very first slide I showed,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.240
and producing an image
of what the Earth looks like at night.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.616
When you normally see that map,

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.160
on a normal map, the kind of map
that most of you will be used to,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.440
you think you are seeing
a map of where people live.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.600
Where the lights are shining up
is where people live.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.696
But here, on this image of the world,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.600
remember we've stretched the map again.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.680
Everywhere has the same density
of people on this map.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.656
If an area doesn't have people,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.576
we've shrunk it away

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.136
to make it disappear.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.296
So we're showing everybody

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.760
with equal prominence.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.616
Now, the lights no longer show you
where people are,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.080
because people are everywhere.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.056
Now the lights on the map,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.056
the lights in London,
the lights in Cairo, the lights in Tokyo,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.016
the lights on the Eastern Seaboard
of the United States,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.976
the lights show you where people live

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.200
who are so profligate with energy

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.680
that they can afford

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.216
to spend money

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.696
powering lights to shine up into the sky,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.800
so satellites can draw an image like this.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.960
And the areas that are dark on the map

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.440
are either areas where people
do not have access to that much energy,

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.496
or areas where people do,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.360
but they have learned to stop
shining the light up into the sky.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.496
And if I could show you this map
animated over time,

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.096
you would see that Tokyo
has actually become darker,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.920
because ever since the tsunami in Japan,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.296
Japan has had to rely
on a quarter less electricity

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.320
because it turned
the nuclear power stations off.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.640
And the world didn't end.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.576
You just shone less light

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.520
up into the sky.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.296
There are a huge number

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.760
of good news stories in the world.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.296
Infant mortality is falling

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.200
and has been falling
at an incredible rate.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.360
A few years ago,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.176
the number of babies dying
in their first year of life in the world

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.280
fell by five percent in just one year.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.096
More children are going to school

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.736
and learning to read and write

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.576
and getting connected to the Internet

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.616
and going on to go to university

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.536
than ever before at an incredible rate,

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.016
and the highest number of young people
going to university in the world

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.920
are women, not men.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.056
I can give you good news story
after good news story

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.696
about what is getting
better in the planet,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.280
but we tend to concentrate

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.616
on the bad news that is immediate.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.840
Rebecca Solnit, I think,
put it brilliantly,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.600
when she explained: "The accretion
of incremental, imperceptible changes

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.336
which can constitute progress
and which render our era

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.176
dramatically different from the past" --

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.240
the past was much more stable --

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.616
"a contrast obscured by the undramatic
nature of gradual transformation,

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.600
punctuated by occasional tumult."

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.680
Occasionally, terrible things happen.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.176
You are shown those terrible things

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.856
on the news every night of the week.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.856
You are not told about
the population slowing down.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.896
You are not told about the world
becoming more connected.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.576
You are not told about the incredible
improvements in understanding.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.736
You are not told about
how we are learning to begin

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.216
to waste less and consume less.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.440
This is my last map.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.736
On this map, we have taken the seas

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.560
and the oceans out.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.496
Now you are just looking

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.376
at about 7.4 billion people

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.320
with the map drawn
in proportion to those people.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.296
You're looking at over a billion in China,

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.136
and you can see the largest
city in the world in China,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.640
but you do not know its name.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.936
You can see that India

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.040
is in the center of this world.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.936
You can see that Europe is on the edge.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.016
And we in Exeter today

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.976
are on the far edge of the planet.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.976
We are on a tiny scrap of rock

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.696
off Europe

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.336
which contains less than one percent

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.376
of the world's adults,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.936
and less than half a percent

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.800
of the world's children.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.256
We are living in a stabilizing world,
an urbanizing world,

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.256
an aging world,

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.416
a connecting world.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.880
There are many, many things
to be frightened about,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.936
but there is no need for us
to fear each other as much as we do,

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.200
and we need to see
that we are now living in a new world.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.176
Thank you very much.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.840
(Applause)
