00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.753
So, has everybody heard of CRISPR?

00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:06.485
I would be shocked if you hadn't.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.711
This is a technology --
it's for genome editing --

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:12.569
and it's so versatile and so controversial

00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:15.834
that it's sparking all sorts
of really interesting conversations.

00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:18.694
Should we bring back the woolly mammoth?

00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:21.575
Should we edit a human embryo?

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:24.163
And my personal favorite:

00:00:24.997 --> 00:00:28.648
How can we justify
wiping out an entire species

00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:31.116
that we consider harmful to humans

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.442
off the face of the Earth,

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.983
using this technology?

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:38.448
This type of science
is moving much faster

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:41.316
than the regulatory mechanisms
that govern it.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.407
And so, for the past six years,

00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:45.376
I've made it my personal mission

00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:48.873
to make sure that as many people
as possible understand

00:00:48.897 --> 00:00:51.997
these types of technologies
and their implications.

00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:56.550
Now, CRISPR has been the subject
of a huge media hype,

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.448
and the words that are used most often
are "easy" and "cheap."

00:01:02.337 --> 00:01:05.476
So what I want to do is drill down
a little bit deeper

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.684
and look into some of the myths
and the realities around CRISPR.

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:12.904
If you're trying to CRISPR a genome,

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:16.194
the first thing that you have to do
is damage the DNA.

00:01:17.098 --> 00:01:20.140
The damage comes in the form
of a double-strand break

00:01:20.164 --> 00:01:21.728
through the double helix.

00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:24.504
And then the cellular repair
processes kick in,

00:01:25.088 --> 00:01:27.727
and then we convince
those repair processes

00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:29.627
to make the edit that we want,

00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:31.596
and not a natural edit.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.865
That's how it works.

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.652
It's a two-part system.

00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:39.047
You've got a Cas9 protein
and something called a guide RNA.

00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:41.533
I like to think of it as a guided missile.

00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:44.203
So the Cas9 --
I love to anthropomorphize --

00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:47.457
so the Cas9 is kind of this Pac-Man thing

00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:49.026
that wants to chew DNA,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.206
and the guide RNA is the leash
that's keeping it out of the genome

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.079
until it finds the exact spot
where it matches.

00:01:56.912 --> 00:01:59.806
And the combination of those two
is called CRISPR.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.398
It's a system that we stole

00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:04.316
from an ancient, ancient
bacterial immune system.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.209
The part that's amazing about it
is that the guide RNA,

00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:11.932
only 20 letters of it,

00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:13.594
are what target the system.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.713
This is really easy to design,

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:18.556
and it's really cheap to buy.

00:02:18.985 --> 00:02:22.990
So that's the part
that is modular in the system;

00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:24.812
everything else stays the same.

00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:28.912
This makes it a remarkably easy
and powerful system to use.

00:02:30.047 --> 00:02:34.287
The guide RNA and the Cas9
protein complex together

00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:36.243
go bouncing along the genome,

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:39.760
and when they find a spot
where the guide RNA matches,

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.639
then it inserts between the two strands
of the double helix,

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:44.231
it rips them apart,

00:02:44.692 --> 00:02:47.380
that triggers the Cas9 protein to cut,

00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:49.381
and all of a sudden,

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:51.716
you've got a cell that's in total panic

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.365
because now it's got a piece
of DNA that's broken.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.296
What does it do?

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.514
It calls its first responders.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.581
There are two major repair pathways.

00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:06.674
The first just takes the DNA
and shoves the two pieces back together.

00:03:06.698 --> 00:03:08.796
This isn't a very efficient system,

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.549
because what happens is
sometimes a base drops out

00:03:11.573 --> 00:03:13.000
or a base is added.

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:16.817
It's an OK way to maybe, like,
knock out a gene,

00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:20.074
but it's not the way that we really want
to do genome editing.

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:22.993
The second repair pathway
is a lot more interesting.

00:03:23.017 --> 00:03:24.653
In this repair pathway,

00:03:24.677 --> 00:03:27.358
it takes a homologous piece of DNA.

00:03:27.382 --> 00:03:30.022
And now mind you, in a diploid
organism like people,

00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:34.294
we've got one copy of our genome
from our mom and one from our dad,

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:35.593
so if one gets damaged,

00:03:35.617 --> 00:03:38.012
it can use the other
chromosome to repair it.

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:39.669
So that's where this comes from.

00:03:40.518 --> 00:03:41.982
The repair is made,

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:43.957
and now the genome is safe again.

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:46.139
The way that we can hijack this

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:50.205
is we can feed it a false piece of DNA,

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.373
a piece that has homology on both ends

00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:54.096
but is different in the middle.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.587
So now, you can put
whatever you want in the center

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.126
and the cell gets fooled.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.269
So you can change a letter,

00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:01.558
you can take letters out,

00:04:01.582 --> 00:04:04.506
but most importantly,
you can stuff new DNA in,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.279
kind of like a Trojan horse.

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.274
CRISPR is going to be amazing,

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:12.916
in terms of the number of different
scientific advances

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.597
that it's going to catalyze.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:17.842
The thing that's special about it
is this modular targeting system.

00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:21.633
I mean, we've been shoving DNA
into organisms for years, right?

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:23.784
But because of the modular
targeting system,

00:04:23.808 --> 00:04:26.233
we can actually put it
exactly where we want it.

00:04:27.423 --> 00:04:33.092
The thing is that there's
a lot of talk about it being cheap

00:04:33.116 --> 00:04:34.858
and it being easy.

00:04:34.882 --> 00:04:37.694
And I run a community lab.

00:04:38.242 --> 00:04:41.798
I'm starting to get emails from people
that say stuff like,

00:04:41.822 --> 00:04:44.219
"Hey, can I come to your open night

00:04:44.243 --> 00:04:47.860
and, like, maybe use CRISPR
and engineer my genome?"

00:04:47.884 --> 00:04:48.994
(Laugher)

00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:50.519
Like, seriously.

00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:53.179
I'm, "No, you can't."

00:04:53.203 --> 00:04:54.213
(Laughter)

00:04:54.237 --> 00:04:56.592
"But I've heard it's cheap.
I've heard it's easy."

00:04:56.616 --> 00:04:58.799
We're going to explore that a little bit.

00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:00.772
So, how cheap is it?

00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:03.206
Yeah, it is cheap in comparison.

00:05:03.665 --> 00:05:07.284
It's going to take the cost of the average
materials for an experiment

00:05:07.308 --> 00:05:09.840
from thousands of dollars
to hundreds of dollars,

00:05:09.864 --> 00:05:11.800
and it cuts the time a lot, too.

00:05:11.824 --> 00:05:13.904
It can cut it from weeks to days.

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:15.738
That's great.

00:05:15.762 --> 00:05:18.452
You still need a professional lab
to do the work in;

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:21.988
you're not going to do anything meaningful
outside of a professional lab.

00:05:22.012 --> 00:05:24.016
I mean, don't listen to anyone who says

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.771
you can do this sort of stuff
on your kitchen table.

00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:31.929
It's really not easy
to do this kind of work.

00:05:31.953 --> 00:05:34.261
Not to mention,
there's a patent battle going on,

00:05:34.285 --> 00:05:36.111
so even if you do invent something,

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:42.771
the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley
are in this incredible patent battle.

00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:45.183
It's really fascinating
to watch it happen,

00:05:45.207 --> 00:05:48.455
because they're accusing each other
of fraudulent claims

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.210
and then they've got people saying,

00:05:50.234 --> 00:05:53.018
"Oh, well, I signed
my notebook here or there."

00:05:53.042 --> 00:05:55.143
This isn't going to be settled for years.

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:56.327
And when it is,

00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:59.636
you can bet you're going to pay someone
a really hefty licensing fee

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.009
in order to use this stuff.

00:06:01.343 --> 00:06:03.124
So, is it really cheap?

00:06:03.148 --> 00:06:08.347
Well, it's cheap if you're doing
basic research and you've got a lab.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.496
How about easy?
Let's look at that claim.

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:14.905
The devil is always in the details.

00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:19.012
We don't really know
that much about cells.

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:20.706
They're still kind of black boxes.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.590
For example, we don't know
why some guide RNAs work really well

00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:27.677
and some guide RNAs don't.

00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:31.169
We don't know why some cells
want to do one repair pathway

00:06:31.193 --> 00:06:33.651
and some cells would rather do the other.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.554
And besides that,

00:06:35.578 --> 00:06:38.447
there's the whole problem
of getting the system into the cell

00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:39.735
in the first place.

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.761
In a petri dish, that's not that hard,

00:06:41.785 --> 00:06:44.230
but if you're trying to do it
on a whole organism,

00:06:44.254 --> 00:06:45.797
it gets really tricky.

00:06:46.224 --> 00:06:49.410
It's OK if you use something
like blood or bone marrow --

00:06:49.434 --> 00:06:51.661
those are the targets
of a lot of research now.

00:06:51.685 --> 00:06:53.936
There was a great story
of some little girl

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.612
who they saved from leukemia

00:06:55.636 --> 00:06:58.310
by taking the blood out, editing it,
and putting it back

00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:00.383
with a precursor of CRISPR.

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:03.665
And this is a line of research
that people are going to do.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.242
But right now, if you want to get
into the whole body,

00:07:06.266 --> 00:07:08.410
you're probably going
to have to use a virus.

00:07:08.434 --> 00:07:10.807
So you take the virus,
you put the CRISPR into it,

00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:12.537
you let the virus infect the cell.

00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:14.704
But now you've got this virus in there,

00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:17.416
and we don't know what the long-term
effects of that are.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.708
Plus, CRISPR has some off-target effects,

00:07:19.732 --> 00:07:22.693
a very small percentage,
but they're still there.

00:07:22.717 --> 00:07:25.515
What's going to happen
over time with that?

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:28.251
These are not trivial questions,

00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:30.915
and there are scientists
that are trying to solve them,

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:33.225
and they will eventually,
hopefully, be solved.

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:36.883
But it ain't plug-and-play,
not by a long shot.

00:07:36.907 --> 00:07:38.666
So: Is it really easy?

00:07:39.032 --> 00:07:43.365
Well, if you spend a few years
working it out in your particular system,

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:44.814
yes, it is.

00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:47.510
Now the other thing is,

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:53.893
we don't really know that much about how
to make a particular thing happen

00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:56.822
by changing particular spots
in the genome.

00:07:57.306 --> 00:07:59.473
We're a long way away from figuring out

00:07:59.497 --> 00:08:01.866
how to give a pig wings, for example.

00:08:02.364 --> 00:08:05.228
Or even an extra leg -- I'd settle
for an extra leg.

00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:06.898
That would be kind of cool, right?

00:08:06.922 --> 00:08:08.458
But what is happening

00:08:08.482 --> 00:08:12.832
is that CRISPR is being used
by thousands and thousands of scientists

00:08:12.856 --> 00:08:15.228
to do really, really important work,

00:08:15.252 --> 00:08:20.696
like making better models
of diseases in animals, for example,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.702
or for taking pathways
that produce valuable chemicals

00:08:25.726 --> 00:08:29.608
and getting them into industrial
production in fermentation vats,

00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:33.482
or even doing really basic research
on what genes do.

00:08:34.022 --> 00:08:36.951
This is the story of CRISPR
we should be telling,

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:40.439
and I don't like it
that the flashier aspects of it

00:08:40.463 --> 00:08:42.219
are drowning all of this out.

00:08:42.243 --> 00:08:46.817
Lots of scientists did a lot of work
to make CRISPR happen,

00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:48.460
and what's interesting to me

00:08:48.484 --> 00:08:52.994
is that these scientists
are being supported by our society.

00:08:53.423 --> 00:08:54.582
Think about it.

00:08:54.606 --> 00:08:58.625
We've got an infrastructure that allows
a certain percentage of people

00:08:58.983 --> 00:09:02.292
to spend all their time doing research.

00:09:02.984 --> 00:09:06.355
That makes us all the inventors of CRISPR,

00:09:06.998 --> 00:09:11.466
and I would say that makes us all
the shepherds of CRISPR.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.297
We all have a responsibility.

00:09:13.749 --> 00:09:17.705
So I would urge you to really learn
about these types of technologies,

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.029
because, really, only in that way

00:09:20.415 --> 00:09:24.767
are we going to be able to guide
the development of these technologies,

00:09:24.791 --> 00:09:26.723
the use of these technologies

00:09:26.747 --> 00:09:30.502
and make sure that, in the end,
it's a positive outcome --

00:09:31.034 --> 00:09:34.166
for both the planet and for us.

00:09:34.698 --> 00:09:35.890
Thanks.

00:09:35.914 --> 00:09:39.816
