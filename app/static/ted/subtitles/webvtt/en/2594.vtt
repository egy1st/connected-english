00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.536
When Dorothy was a little girl,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.360
she was fascinated by her goldfish.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.536
Her father explained to her that fish swim
by quickly wagging their tails

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.440
to propel themselves through the water.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.176
Without hesitation,
little Dorothy responded,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.456
"Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards
by wagging their heads."

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.096
(Laughter)

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.936
In her mind, it was a fact
as true as any other.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.296
Fish swim backwards
by wagging their heads.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.520
She believed it.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.296
Our lives are full
of fish swimming backwards.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.816
We make assumptions
and faulty leaps of logic.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.095
We harbor bias.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.376
We know that we are right,
and they are wrong.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.016
We fear the worst.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.200
We strive for unattainable perfection.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.000
We tell ourselves
what we can and cannot do.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.976
In our minds, fish swim by in reverse
frantically wagging their heads

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.429
and we don't even notice them.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.336
I'm going to tell you
five facts about myself.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.680
One fact is not true.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.560
One: I graduated from Harvard at 19
with an honors degree in mathematics.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.640
Two: I currently run
a construction company in Orlando.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.040
Three: I starred on a television sitcom.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.880
Four: I lost my sight
to a rare genetic eye disease.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.400
Five: I served as a law clerk
to two US Supreme Court justices.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.560
Which fact is not true?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.240
Actually, they're all true.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.520
Yeah. They're all true.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.960
(Applause)

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.336
At this point, most people really
only care about the television show.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.040
(Laughter)

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.240
I know this from experience.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.656
OK, so the show was NBC's
"Saved by the Bell: The New Class."

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.280
And I played Weasel Wyzell,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.296
who was the sort of dorky,
nerdy character on the show,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.096
which made it a very
major acting challenge

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.616
for me as a 13-year-old boy.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.160
(Laughter)

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.240
Now, did you struggle
with number four, my blindness?

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.320
Why is that?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.256
We make assumptions
about so-called disabilities.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.456
As a blind man, I confront
others' incorrect assumptions

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.240
about my abilities every day.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.176
My point today is not
about my blindness, however.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.400
It's about my vision.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.280
Going blind taught me
to live my life eyes wide open.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.576
It taught me to spot
those backwards-swimming fish

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.096
that our minds create.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.280
Going blind cast them into focus.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.840
What does it feel like to see?

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.360
It's immediate and passive.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.936
You open your eyes and there's the world.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.056
Seeing is believing. Sight is truth.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.280
Right?

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.800
Well, that's what I thought.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.440
Then, from age 12 to 25,
my retinas progressively deteriorated.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.296
My sight became an increasingly bizarre

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.600
carnival funhouse hall
of mirrors and illusions.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.976
The salesperson I was relieved
to spot in a store

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.200
was really a mannequin.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.376
Reaching down to wash my hands,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.616
I suddenly saw it was
a urinal I was touching, not a sink,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.355
when my fingers felt its true shape.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.296
A friend described
the photograph in my hand,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.440
and only then I could see
the image depicted.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.040
Objects appeared, morphed
and disappeared in my reality.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.520
It was difficult and exhausting to see.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.856
I pieced together fragmented,
transitory images,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.856
consciously analyzed the clues,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.960
searched for some logic
in my crumbling kaleidoscope,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.126
until I saw nothing at all.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.256
I learned that what we see

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.640
is not universal truth.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.400
It is not objective reality.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.696
What we see is a unique,
personal, virtual reality

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.840
that is masterfully
constructed by our brain.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.894
Let me explain with a bit
of amateur neuroscience.

00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:01.158
Your visual cortex takes up
about 30 percent of your brain.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.016
That's compared to approximately
eight percent for touch

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.840
and two to three percent for hearing.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.336
Every second, your eyes
can send your visual cortex

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.520
as many as two billion
pieces of information.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.800
The rest of your body can send your brain
only an additional billion.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.896
So sight is one third
of your brain by volume

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.240
and can claim about two thirds
of your brain's processing resources.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.256
It's no surprise then

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.376
that the illusion
of sight is so compelling.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.800
But make no mistake about it:
sight is an illusion.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.736
Here's where it gets interesting.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.856
To create the experience of sight,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.416
your brain references your conceptual
understanding of the world,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.496
other knowledge, your memories,
opinions, emotions, mental attention.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.080
All of these things and far more
are linked in your brain to your sight.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.456
These linkages work both ways,
and usually occur subconsciously.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.336
So for example,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.496
what you see impacts how you feel,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.120
and the way you feel
can literally change what you see.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.760
Numerous studies demonstrate this.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.456
If you are asked to estimate

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.656
the walking speed of a man
in a video, for example,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.800
your answer will be different if you're
told to think about cheetahs or turtles.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.416
A hill appears steeper
if you've just exercised,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.656
and a landmark appears farther away

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.360
if you're wearing a heavy backpack.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.840
We have arrived
at a fundamental contradiction.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.576
What you see is a complex
mental construction of your own making,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.376
but you experience it passively

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.800
as a direct representation
of the world around you.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.280
You create your own reality,
and you believe it.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.800
I believed mine until it broke apart.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.360
The deterioration of my eyes
shattered the illusion.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.016
You see, sight is just one way

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.720
we shape our reality.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.880
We create our own realities
in many other ways.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.120
Let's take fear as just one example.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.280
Your fears distort your reality.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.056
Under the warped logic of fear,
anything is better than the uncertain.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.536
Fear fills the void at all costs,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.696
passing off what you dread
for what you know,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.496
offering up the worst
in place of the ambiguous,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.280
substituting assumption for reason.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.856
Psychologists have
a great term for it: awfulizing.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.976
(Laughter)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.536
Right?

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.840
Fear replaces the unknown with the awful.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.976
Now, fear is self-realizing.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.736
When you face the greatest need

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.416
to look outside yourself
and think critically,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.256
fear beats a retreat
deep inside your mind,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.056
shrinking and distorting your view,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.136
drowning your capacity
for critical thought

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.880
with a flood of disruptive emotions.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.736
When you face a compelling
opportunity to take action,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.256
fear lulls you into inaction,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.800
enticing you to passively watch
its prophecies fulfill themselves.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.096
When I was diagnosed
with my blinding disease,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.160
I knew blindness would ruin my life.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.336
Blindness was a death sentence
for my independence.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.240
It was the end of achievement for me.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.576
Blindness meant I would live
an unremarkable life,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.296
small and sad,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.520
and likely alone.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.480
I knew it.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.240
This was a fiction born of my fears,
but I believed it.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.416
It was a lie, but it was my reality,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.600
just like those backwards-swimming fish
in little Dorothy's mind.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.416
If I had not confronted
the reality of my fear,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.640
I would have lived it.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.480
I am certain of that.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.440
So how do you live your life
eyes wide open?

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.960
It is a learned discipline.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.960
It can be taught. It can be practiced.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.109
I will summarize very briefly.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.536
Hold yourself accountable

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.056
for every moment, every thought,

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.280
every detail.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.776
See beyond your fears.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.536
Recognize your assumptions.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.336
Harness your internal strength.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.536
Silence your internal critic.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.360
Correct your misconceptions
about luck and about success.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.920
Accept your strengths and your weaknesses,
and understand the difference.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.896
Open your hearts

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.320
to your bountiful blessings.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.696
Your fears, your critics,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.576
your heroes, your villains --

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.616
they are your excuses,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.976
rationalizations, shortcuts,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.320
justifications, your surrender.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.679
They are fictions you perceive as reality.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.655
Choose to see through them.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.919
Choose to let them go.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.039
You are the creator of your reality.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.280
With that empowerment
comes complete responsibility.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.560
I chose to step out of fear's tunnel
into terrain uncharted and undefined.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.840
I chose to build there a blessed life.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.896
Far from alone,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.896
I share my beautiful life with Dorothy,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.576
my beautiful wife,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.760
with our triplets,
whom we call the Tripskys,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.416
and with the latest addition
to the family,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.800
sweet baby Clementine.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.040
What do you fear?

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.360
What lies do you tell yourself?

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.440
How do you embellish your truth
and write your own fictions?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.840
What reality are you
creating for yourself?

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.376
In your career and personal life,
in your relationships,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.016
and in your heart and soul,

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.440
your backwards-swimming fish
do you great harm.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.480
They exact a toll in missed opportunities
and unrealized potential,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.776
and they engender insecurity and distrust

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.240
where you seek fulfillment and connection.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.760
I urge you to search them out.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.536
Helen Keller said that the only thing
worse than being blind

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.560
is having sight but no vision.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.696
For me, going blind
was a profound blessing,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.760
because blindness gave me vision.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.720
I hope you can see what I see.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.496
Thank you.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.680
(Applause)

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.896
Bruno Giussani: Isaac, before you
leave the stage, just a question.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.696
This is an audience of entrepreneurs,
of doers, of innovators.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.376
You are a CEO of a company
down in Florida,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.536
and many are probably wondering,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.776
how is it to be a blind CEO?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.576
What kind of specific challenges
do you have, and how do you overcome them?

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.736
Isaac Lidsky: Well,
the biggest challenge became a blessing.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.320
I don't get visual feedback from people.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.976
(Laughter)

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.176
BG: What's that noise there? IL: Yeah.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.696
So, for example,
in my leadership team meetings,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.080
I don't see facial
expressions or gestures.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.376
I've learned to solicit
a lot more verbal feedback.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.400
I basically force people
to tell me what they think.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.936
And in this respect,

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.056
it's become, like I said, a real blessing
for me personally and for my company,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.680
because we communicate
at a far deeper level,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.320
we avoid ambiguities,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:24.010
and most important, my team knows
that what they think truly matters.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.456
BG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED.
IL: Thank you, Bruno.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.185
(Applause)
