00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.416
The language I'm speaking right now

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.776
is on its way to becoming
the world's universal language,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.136
for better or for worse.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.376
Let's face it,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.256
it's the language of the internet,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.256
it's the language of finance,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.616
it's the language of air traffic control,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.016
of popular music,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.256
diplomacy --

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.720
English is everywhere.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.416
Now, Mandarin Chinese
is spoken by more people,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.936
but more Chinese people
are learning English

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.656
than English speakers
are learning Chinese.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.416
Last I heard,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.896
there are two dozen universities
in China right now

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.656
teaching all in English.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.080
English is taking over.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.376
And in addition to that,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.016
it's been predicted
that at the end of the century

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.016
almost all of the languages
that exist now --

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.296
there are about 6,000 --

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.216
will no longer be spoken.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.840
There will only be some hundreds left.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.976
And on top of that,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.576
it's at the point where
instant translation of live speech

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.720
is not only possible,
but it gets better every year.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.096
The reason I'm reciting
those things to you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.256
is because I can tell
that we're getting to the point

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.496
where a question
is going to start being asked,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.056
which is: Why should we
learn foreign languages --

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.056
other than if English
happens to be foreign to one?

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.096
Why bother to learn another one
when it's getting to the point

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.600
where almost everybody in the world
will be able to communicate in one?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.376
I think there are a lot of reasons,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.736
but I first want to address

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.616
the one that you're probably
most likely to have heard of,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.976
because actually it's more
dangerous than you might think.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.736
And that is the idea

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.536
that a language channels your thoughts,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.936
that the vocabulary
and the grammar of different languages

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.776
gives everybody
a different kind of acid trip,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.016
so to speak.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.256
That is a marvelously enticing idea,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.576
but it's kind of fraught.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.056
So it's not that it's untrue completely.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.895
So for example, in French and Spanish

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:13.176
the word for table is,
for some reason, marked as feminine.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.136
So, "la table," "la mesa,"
you just have to deal with it.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.656
It has been shown

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.076
that if you are a speaker
of one of those languages

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.776
and you happen to be asked

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.856
how you would imagine a table talking,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.776
then much more often
than could possibly be an accident,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.496
a French or a Spanish speaker

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.376
says that the table would talk
with a high and feminine voice.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.536
So if you're French or Spanish,
to you, a table is kind of a girl,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.736
as opposed to if you
are an English speaker.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.576
It's hard not to love data like that,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.736
and many people
will tell you that that means

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.576
that there's a worldview that you have
if you speak one of those languages.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.896
But you have to watch out,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.376
because imagine if somebody
put us under the microscope,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.856
the us being those of us
who speak English natively.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.736
What is the worldview from English?

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.496
So for example,
let's take an English speaker.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.816
Up on the screen, that is Bono.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.456
He speaks English.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.416
I presume he has a worldview.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.096
Now, that is Donald Trump.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.336
In his way,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.776
he speaks English as well.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.320
(Laughter)

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.856
And here is Ms. Kardashian,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.856
and she is an English speaker, too.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.656
So here are three speakers
of the English language.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.256
What worldview do those
three people have in common?

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.376
What worldview is shaped through
the English language that unites them?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.216
It's a highly fraught concept.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.096
And so gradual consensus is becoming
that language can shape thought,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.576
but it tends to be in rather darling,
obscure psychological flutters.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.200
It's not a matter of giving you
a different pair of glasses on the world.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.016
Now, if that's the case,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.976
then why learn languages?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.536
If it isn't going to change
the way you think,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.160
what would the other reasons be?

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.920
There are some.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.976
One of them is that if you
want to imbibe a culture,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.136
if you want to drink it in,
if you want to become part of it,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.056
then whether or not
the language channels the culture --

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.016
and that seems doubtful --

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.856
if you want to imbibe the culture,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.336
you have to control to some degree

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.696
the language that the culture
happens to be conducted in.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.416
There's no other way.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.936
There's an interesting
illustration of this.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.656
I have to go slightly obscure,
but really you should seek it out.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.016
There's a movie by the Canadian
film director Denys Arcand --

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.736
read out in English on the page,
"Dennis Ar-cand,"

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.096
if you want to look him up.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.176
He did a film called "Jesus of Montreal."

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.336
And many of the characters

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.416
are vibrant, funny, passionate,
interesting French-Canadian,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.776
French-speaking women.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.256
There's one scene closest to the end,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.736
where they have to take a friend
to an Anglophone hospital.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.856
In the hospital,
they have to speak English.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.736
Now, they speak English
but it's not their native language,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.456
they'd rather not speak English.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.416
And they speak it more slowly,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.416
they have accents, they're not idiomatic.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.136
Suddenly these characters
that you've fallen in love with

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.560
become husks of themselves,
they're shadows of themselves.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.976
To go into a culture

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.016
and to only ever process people
through that kind of skrim curtain

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.936
is to never truly get the culture.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.736
And so to the extent that hundreds
of languages will be left,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.016
one reason to learn them

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.736
is because they are tickets
to being able to participate

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.016
in the culture of the people
who speak them,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.216
just by virtue of the fact
that it is their code.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.480
So that's one reason.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.736
Second reason:

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.176
it's been shown

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.136
that if you speak two languages,
dementia is less likely to set in,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.496
and that you are probably
a better multitasker.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.936
And these are factors that set in early,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.896
and so that ought to give you some sense

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.456
of when to give junior or juniorette
lessons in another language.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.896
Bilingualism is healthy.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.816
And then, third --

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.240
languages are just an awful lot of fun.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.536
Much more fun than we're often told.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.856
So for example,
Arabic: "kataba," he wrote,

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.096
"yaktubu," he writes, she writes.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.136
"Uktub," write, in the imperative.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.056
What do those things have in common?

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.176
All those things have in common

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.736
the consonants sitting
in the middle like pillars.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.216
They stay still,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.376
and the vowels
dance around the consonants.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.576
Who wouldn't want to roll
that around in their mouths?

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.016
You can get that from Hebrew,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.696
you can get that from Ethiopia's
main language, Amharic.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.136
That's fun.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.576
Or languages have different word orders.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.816
Learning how to speak
with different word order

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.816
is like driving on the different side
of a street if you go to certain country,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.336
or the feeling that you get when you
put Witch Hazel around your eyes

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.696
and you feel the tingle.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.296
A language can do that to you.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.536
So for example,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.576
"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,"

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.096
a book that I'm sure
we all often return to,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.376
like "Moby Dick."

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.496
One phrase in it is,
"Do you know where I found him?

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.176
Do you know where he was?
He was eating cake in the tub,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.416
Yes he was!"

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.776
Fine. Now, if you learn that
in Mandarin Chinese,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.056
then you have to master,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.336
"You can know, I did where him find?

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.176
He was tub inside gorging cake,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.016
No mistake gorging chewing!"

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.256
That just feels good.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.576
Imagine being able to do that
for years and years at a time.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.936
Or, have you ever learned any Cambodian?

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.976
Me either, but if I did,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.616
I would get to roll around in my mouth
not some baker's dozen of vowels

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.896
like English has,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.936
but a good 30 different vowels

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.856
scooching and oozing around
in the Cambodian mouth

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.216
like bees in a hive.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.760
That is what a language can get you.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.696
And more to the point,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.656
we live in an era when it's never been
easier to teach yourself another language.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.936
It used to be that you had
to go to a classroom,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.016
and there would be
some diligent teacher --

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.656
some genius teacher in there --

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.016
but that person was only
in there at certain times

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.296
and you had to go then,

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.136
and then was not most times.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.560
You had to go to class.

00:08:28.974 --> 00:08:31.736
If you didn't have that,
you had something called a record.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.456
I cut my teeth on those.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.176
There was only so much data on a record,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.456
or a cassette,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.816
or even that antique object known as a CD.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.456
Other than that you had books
that didn't work,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.856
that's just the way it was.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.776
Today you can lay down --

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.256
lie on your living room floor,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.496
sipping bourbon,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.296
and teach yourself
any language that you want to

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.896
with wonderful sets
such as Rosetta Stone.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.056
I highly recommend
the lesser known Glossika as well.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.376
You can do it any time,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.000
therefore you can do it more and better.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.296
You can give yourself your morning
pleasures in various languages.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.056
I take some "Dilbert" in various
languages every single morning;

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.736
it can increase your skills.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.616
Couldn't have done it 20 years ago

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.176
when the idea of having
any language you wanted

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.776
in your pocket,

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.296
coming from your phone,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.040
would have sounded like science fiction
to very sophisticated people.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.336
So I highly recommend

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.336
that you teach yourself languages
other than the one that I'm speaking,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.536
because there's never been
a better time to do it.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.056
It's an awful lot of fun.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.896
It won't change your mind,

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.096
but it will most certainly blow your mind.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.336
Thank you very much.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.161
(Applause)
