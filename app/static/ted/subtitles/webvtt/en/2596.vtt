WEBVTT

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.040
Good evening.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.576
My journey to this stage

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.216
began when I came to America

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.080
at the age of 17.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.656
You see, I'm one
of the 84 million Americans

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.976
who are immigrants

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.416
or children of immigrants.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.256
Each of us has a dream when we come here,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.296
a dream that usually has to be rewritten

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.640
and always has to be repurposed.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.456
I was one of the lucky ones.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.296
My revised dream
led me to the work I do today:

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.256
training immigrants
to run for public office

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.440
and leading a movement
for inclusive democracy.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.456
But I don't want you to think
it was a cakewalk,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.760
that America opened its arms wide
and welcomed me.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.840
It's still not doing that.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.256
And I've learned
a few lessons along the way

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.896
that I wanted to share with you,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.896
because I think that together

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.616
we can make American democracy

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.280
better and stronger.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.976
I was born in India,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.976
the world's largest democracy,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.256
and when I was four,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.096
my family moved to Belize,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.560
the world's smallest democracy perhaps.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.136
And at the age of 17,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.016
I moved to the United States,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.600
the world's greatest democracy.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.360
I came because I wanted
to study English literature.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.936
You see, as a child,
I buried my nose in books,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.616
and I thought, why not make a living
doing that as an adult?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.096
But after I graduated from college

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.256
and got a graduate degree,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.800
I found myself moving
from one less ideal job to another.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.016
Maybe it was the optimism
that I had about America

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.936
that made me take a while to understand

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.216
that things were not going to change.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.136
The door that I thought was open

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.056
was actually just slightly ajar --

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.016
this door of America

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.136
that would open wide
if you had the right name,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.776
the right skin color,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.656
the right networks,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.416
but could just slam in your face

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.536
if you had the wrong religion,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.400
the wrong immigration status,

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.920
the wrong skin color.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.456
And I just couldn't accept that.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.400
So I started a career
as a social entrepreneur,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.496
starting an organization
for young people like myself --

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.640
I was young at the time
that I started it --

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.840
who traced their heritage
to the Indian subcontinent.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.840
In that work, I became and advocate
for South Asians and other immigrants.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.600
I lobbied members of Congress
on policy issues.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.920
I volunteered on election day
to do exit polling.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.800
But I couldn't vote,
and I couldn't run for office.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.816
So in 2000, when it was announced

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.656
that the citizenship application fee
was going to more than double

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.376
from 95 dollars to 225 dollars,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.560
I decided it was time to apply
before I could no longer afford it.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.536
I filled out a long application,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.880
answering questions about
my current and my past affiliations.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.576
And once the application was submitted,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.856
there were fingerprints to be taken,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.056
a test to study for,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.680
endless hours of waiting in line.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.600
You might call it extreme vetting.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.016
And then in December of 2000,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.016
I joined hundreds of other immigrants

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.176
in a hall in Brooklyn

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.536
where we pledged our loyalty

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.216
to a country that we had
long considered home.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.856
My journey from international student
to American citizen took 16 years,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.200
a short timeline when you compare it
to other immigrant stories.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.176
And soon after I had taken
that formal step

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.136
to becoming an American,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.016
the attacks of September 11, 2001,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.200
changed the immigration landscape
for decades to come.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.816
My city, New York City,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.216
was reeling and healing,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.616
and in the midst of it,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.440
we were in an election cycle.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.896
Two things happened

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.600
as we coped with loss and recovery
in New York City.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.400
Voters elected Michael Bloomberg
mayor of New York City.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.776
We also adopted by ballot referendum

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800
the Office of Immigrant Affairs
for the City of New York.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.360
Five months after that election,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.920
the newly elected mayor

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.896
appointed me the first Commissioner
of Immigrant Affairs

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.200
for this newly established office.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.320
I want you to come back to that time.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.800
I was a young immigrant woman from Belize.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.296
I had basically floundered
in various jobs in America

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.856
before I started
a community-based organization

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.080
in a church basement in Queens.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.360
The attacks of September 11
sent shock waves through my community.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.296
People who were members of my family,
young people I had worked with,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.136
were experiencing harassment

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.560
at schools, at workplaces
and in airports.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.200
And now I was going
to represent their concerns

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.200
in government.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.480
No job felt more perfect for me.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.600
And here are two things I learned
when I became Commissioner.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.056
First, well-meaning New Yorkers

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.216
who were in city government
holding government positions

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.720
had no idea how scared immigrants were

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.920
of law enforcement.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.056
Most of us don't really know
the difference, do we,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.440
between a sheriff
and local police and the FBI.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.896
And most of us,
when we see someone in uniform

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.816
going through our neighborhoods

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.240
feel curiosity, if not concern.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.016
So if you're an undocumented parent,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.056
every day when you say
goodbye to your child,

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.816
send them off to school and go to work,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.816
you don't know what the chances are

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.416
that you're going to see them
at the end of the day.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.760
Because a raid at your workplace,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.136
a chance encounter with local police

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.840
could change the course
of your life forever.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.216
The second thing I learned
is that when people like me,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.800
who understood that fear,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.816
who had learned a new language,
who had navigated new systems,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.176
when people like us
were sitting at the table,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.320
we advocated for our communities' needs
in a way that no one else could or would.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.440
I understood what that feeling
of fear was like.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.376
People in my family were experiencing it.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.816
Young people I had worked with
were being harassed,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.816
not just by classmates,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.600
but also by their teachers.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.336
My husband, then boyfriend,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.576
thought twice before he put
a backpack on or grew a beard

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.240
because he traveled so much.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.256
What I learned in 2001
was that my vote mattered

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.560
but that my voice
and vantage point also mattered.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.336
And it's these three things --

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.496
immigrants' votes,
voices and vantage points --

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.480
that I think can help
make our democracy stronger.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.056
We actually have the power

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.056
to change the outcome of elections,

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.216
to introduce new issues
into the policy debate

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.136
and to change the face
of the pale, male, stale leadership

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.960
that we have in our country today.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.176
So how do we do that?

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.776
Well, let's talk first about votes.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.456
It will come as no surprise to you

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.240
that the majority of voters
in America are white.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.936
But it might surprise you to know

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.000
that one in three voters
are black, Latino or Asian.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.376
But here's the thing:

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.680
it doesn't just matter who can vote,
it matters who does vote.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.856
So in 2012, half of the Latino
and Asian-American voters

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.120
did not vote.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.696
And these votes matter
not just in presidential elections.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.800
They matter in local and state elections.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.456
In 2015, Lan Diep,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.800
the eldest son of political
refugees from Vietnam,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.320
ran for a seat
in the San Jose City Council.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.640
He lost that election by 13 votes.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.856
This year, he dusted off
those campaign shoes

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.720
and went back to run for that seat,

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.480
and this time he won, by 12 votes.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.920
Every one of our votes matters.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.816
And when people like Lan
are sitting at the policy table,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.176
they can make a difference.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.976
We need those voices.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.256
We need those voices

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.376
in part because American leadership

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.240
does not look like America's residents.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.880
There are over 500,000
local and state offices in America.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.136
Fewer than 2 percent of those offices
are held by Asian-Americans or Latinos,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.920
the two largest immigrant groups
in our country.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.936
In the city of Yakima, Washington,

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.576
where 49 percent
of the population is Latino,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.160
there has never been a Latino
on the city council until this year.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.496
Three newly elected Latinas
joined the Yakima City Council in 2016.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.216
One of them is Carmen Méndez.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.976
She is a first-generation college student.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.816
She grew up partly in Colima, Mexico,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.256
and partly in Yakima, Washington.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.720
She's a single mother,
a community advocate.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.016
Her voice on the Yakima City Council

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.616
is advocating on behalf
of the Latino community

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.896
and of all Yakima residents.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.496
And she's a role model for her daughter

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.800
and other Latinas.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.960
But the third most untapped resource
in American democracy

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.280
is the vantage point
that immigrants bring.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.240
We have fought to be here.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.416
We have come for economic
and educational opportunity.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.776
We have come for political
and religious freedom.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.960
We have come in the pursuit of love.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.016
That dedication,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.840
that commitment to America

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.320
we also bring to public service.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.656
People like Athena Salman,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.176
who just last week won the primary

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.576
for a seat in the Arizona State House.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.696
Athena's father grew up in the West Bank

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.936
and moved to Chicago,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.416
where he met her mother.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.496
Her mother is part Italian,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.936
part Mexican and part German.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.600
Together they moved to Arizona
and built a life.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.936
Athena, when she gets to the statehouse,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.496
is going to fight for things
like education funding

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.056
that will help give
families like hers a leg up

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.096
so they can achieve
the financial stability

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.960
that we all are looking for.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.376
Immigrants' votes,
voices and vantage points

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.296
are what we all need to work
to include in American democracy.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.920
It's not just my work. It's also yours.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.496
And it's not going to be easy.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.176
We never know

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.400
what putting a new factor
into an equation will do.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.760
And it's a little scary.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.696
You're scared that I'm going
to take away your place at the table,

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.200
and I'm scared that I'm never
going to get a place at the table.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.616
And we're all scared

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.720
that we're going to lose this country
that we know and love.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.696
I'm scared you're going
to take it away from me,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.200
and you're scared
I'm going to take it away from you.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.576
Look, it's been a rough election year,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.976
a reminder that people
with my immigration history

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.400
could be removed at the whim of a leader.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.736
But I have fought to be in this country

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.696
and I continue to do so every day.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.816
So my optimism never wavers,

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.376
because I know that there are
millions of immigrants just like me,

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.360
in front of me,
behind me and all around me.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.880
It's our country, too.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.136
Thank you.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.760
(Applause)
