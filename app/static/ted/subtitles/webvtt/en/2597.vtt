00:00:01.097 --> 00:00:03.134
It was April, last year.

00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:05.461
I was on an evening out with friends

00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:07.238
to celebrate one of their birthdays.

00:00:07.677 --> 00:00:10.070
We hadn't been all together
for a couple of weeks;

00:00:10.094 --> 00:00:12.490
it was a perfect evening,
as we were all reunited.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.473
At the end of the evening,

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:18.182
I caught the last underground train
back to the other side of London.

00:00:18.663 --> 00:00:20.455
The journey was smooth.

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:21.987
I got back to my local station

00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:24.038
and I began the 10-minute walk home.

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.523
As I turned the corner onto my street,

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:29.063
my house in sight up ahead,

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.980
I heard footsteps behind me

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.167
that seemed to have
approached out of nowhere

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:34.591
and were picking up pace.

00:00:35.778 --> 00:00:38.305
Before I had time to process
what was happening,

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.460
a hand was clapped around my mouth
so that I could not breathe,

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:44.184
and the young man behind me
dragged me to the ground,

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:46.334
beat my head repeatedly
against the pavement

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.340
until my face began to bleed,

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:50.572
kicking me in the back and neck

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:52.248
while he began to assault me,

00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:54.734
ripping off my clothes
and telling me to "shut up,"

00:00:54.758 --> 00:00:56.417
as I struggled to cry for help.

00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.819
With each smack of my head
to the concrete ground,

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:02.773
a question echoed through my mind
that still haunts me today:

00:01:03.118 --> 00:01:05.327
"Is this going to be how it all ends?"

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:09.740
Little could I have realized,
I'd been followed the whole way

00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:11.715
from the moment I left the station.

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:12.942
And hours later,

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:16.510
I was standing topless and barelegged
in front of the police,

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.306
having the cuts and bruises
on my naked body photographed

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.852
for forensic evidence.

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:25.195
Now, there are few words to describe
the all-consuming feelings

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.424
of vulnerability, shame, upset
and injustice that I was ridden with

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:30.504
in that moment and for the weeks to come.

00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:34.492
But wanting to find a way
to condense these feelings

00:01:34.516 --> 00:01:36.838
into something ordered
that I could work through,

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.997
I decided to do what
felt most natural to me:

00:01:39.322 --> 00:01:40.557
I wrote about it.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.582
It started out as a cathartic exercise.

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:46.664
I wrote a letter to my assaulter,

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:48.783
humanizing him as "you,"

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:51.684
to identify him as part
of the very community

00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:53.856
that he had so violently
abused that night.

00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.265
Stressing the tidal-wave
effect of his actions,

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.505
I wrote:

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.250
"Did you ever think
of the people in your life?

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:04.178
I don't know who the people
in your life are.

00:02:04.202 --> 00:02:06.159
I don't know anything about you.

00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:07.815
But I do know this:

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:09.920
you did not just attack me that night.

00:02:10.323 --> 00:02:11.836
I'm a daughter, I'm a friend,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.545
I'm a sister, I'm a pupil,

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.871
I'm a cousin, I'm a niece,

00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:16.062
I'm a neighbor;

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:18.135
I'm the employee
who served everyone coffee

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.712
in the cafÃ© under the railway.

00:02:20.362 --> 00:02:22.848
And all the people who form
these relations to me

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:24.525
make up my community.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.684
And you assaulted
every single one of them.

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:30.254
You violated the truth that I
will never cease to fight for,

00:02:30.278 --> 00:02:32.215
and which all of these people represent:

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.509
that there are infinitely more
good people in the world than bad."

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.789
But, determined not to let
this one incident make me lose faith

00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:42.526
in the solidarity in my community
or humanity as a whole,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.028
I recalled the 7/7 terrorist bombings
in July 2005 on London transport,

00:02:47.052 --> 00:02:50.452
and how the mayor of London at the time,
and indeed my own parents,

00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:53.323
had insisted that we all get back
on the tubes the next day,

00:02:53.347 --> 00:02:55.110
so we wouldn't be defined or changed

00:02:55.134 --> 00:02:57.033
by those that had made us feel unsafe.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.944
I told my attacker,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.289
"You've carried out your attack,

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.453
but now I'm getting back on my tube.

00:03:04.162 --> 00:03:07.429
My community will not feel we are unsafe
walking home after dark.

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.156
We will get on the last tubes home,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.014
and we will walk up our streets alone,

00:03:11.038 --> 00:03:13.374
because we will not ingrain
or submit to the idea

00:03:13.398 --> 00:03:16.166
that we are putting ourselves
in danger in doing so.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.790
We will continue
to come together, like an army,

00:03:18.814 --> 00:03:21.761
when any member
of our community is threatened.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.895
And this is a fight you will not win."

00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:27.428
At the time of writing this letter --

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:28.827
(Applause)

00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:29.996
Thank you.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.020
(Applause)

00:03:32.717 --> 00:03:34.437
At the time of writing this letter,

00:03:34.461 --> 00:03:36.316
I was studying for my exams in Oxford,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.724
and I was working
on the local student paper there.

00:03:38.748 --> 00:03:42.048
Despite being lucky enough to have
friends and family supporting me,

00:03:42.072 --> 00:03:43.280
it was an isolating time.

00:03:43.304 --> 00:03:45.791
I didn't know anyone
who'd been through this before;

00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:47.259
at least I didn't think I did.

00:03:47.283 --> 00:03:50.777
I'd read news reports, statistics,
and knew how common sexual assault was,

00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:52.858
yet I couldn't actually name
a single person

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:55.965
that I'd heard speak out
about an experience of this kind before.

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.926
So in a somewhat spontaneous decision,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.946
I decided that I would publish
my letter in the student paper,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.878
hoping to reach out to others in Oxford

00:04:02.902 --> 00:04:06.273
that might have had a similar experience
and be feeling the same way.

00:04:06.297 --> 00:04:07.523
At the end of the letter,

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.913
I asked others to write in
with their experiences

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:11.629
under the hashtag, "#NotGuilty,"

00:04:11.653 --> 00:04:14.679
to emphasize that survivors of assault
could express themselves

00:04:14.703 --> 00:04:17.609
without feeling shame or guilt
about what happened to them --

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:20.209
to show that we could all
stand up to sexual assault.

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:23.065
What I never anticipated
is that almost overnight,

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:25.007
this published letter would go viral.

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:28.145
Soon, we were receiving
hundreds of stories

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.952
from men and women across the world,

00:04:29.976 --> 00:04:32.648
which we began to publish
on a website I set up.

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:34.730
And the hashtag became a campaign.

00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:39.342
There was an Australian mother in her 40s
who described how on an evening out,

00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:40.922
she was followed to the bathroom

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:43.272
by a man who went
to repeatedly grab her crotch.

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:44.918
There was a man in the Netherlands

00:04:44.942 --> 00:04:47.634
who described how he was date-raped
on a visit to London

00:04:47.658 --> 00:04:50.540
and wasn't taken seriously
by anyone he reported his case to.

00:04:50.564 --> 00:04:53.998
I had personal Facebook messages
from people in India and South America,

00:04:54.022 --> 00:04:57.133
saying, how can we bring
the message of the campaign there?

00:04:57.173 --> 00:04:59.971
One of the first contributions we had
was from a woman called Nikki,

00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:02.812
who described growing up,
being molested my her own father.

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:04.319
And I had friends open up to me

00:05:04.343 --> 00:05:07.436
about experiences ranging
from those that happened last week

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.587
to those that happened years ago,
that I'd had no idea about.

00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:13.685
And the more we started
to receive these messages,

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:16.293
the more we also started
to receive messages of hope --

00:05:16.317 --> 00:05:18.792
people feeling empowered
by this community of voices

00:05:18.816 --> 00:05:21.320
standing up to sexual assault
and victim-blaming.

00:05:21.344 --> 00:05:22.643
One woman called Olivia,

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:24.452
after describing how she was attacked

00:05:24.476 --> 00:05:27.302
by someone she had trusted
and cared about for a long time,

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:29.724
said, "I've read many
of the stories posted here,

00:05:29.748 --> 00:05:32.738
and I feel hopeful that if so many
women can move forward,

00:05:32.762 --> 00:05:33.944
then I can, too.

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:35.275
I've been inspired by many,

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:37.492
and I hope I can be as strong
as them someday.

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:38.670
I'm sure I will."

00:05:39.082 --> 00:05:41.808
People around the world began
tweeting under this hashtag,

00:05:41.832 --> 00:05:44.909
and the letter was republished
and covered by the national press,

00:05:44.933 --> 00:05:48.229
as well as being translated into several
other languages worldwide.

00:05:48.642 --> 00:05:51.016
But something struck me
about the media attention

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.651
that this letter was attracting.

00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:54.753
For something to be front-page news,

00:05:54.777 --> 00:05:57.744
given the word "news" itself,

00:05:57.768 --> 00:06:01.148
we can assume it must be something new
or something surprising.

00:06:01.172 --> 00:06:03.398
And yet sexual assault
is not something new.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.731
Sexual assault, along with other
kinds of injustices,

00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:08.643
is reported in the media all the time.

00:06:09.154 --> 00:06:10.352
But through the campaign,

00:06:10.376 --> 00:06:12.983
these injustices were framed
as not just news stories,

00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:16.325
they were firsthand experiences
that had affected real people,

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.699
who were creating,
with the solidarity of others,

00:06:18.723 --> 00:06:20.814
what they needed
and had previously lacked:

00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:22.235
a platform to speak out,

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.711
the reassurance they weren't alone
or to blame for what happened to them

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:29.364
and open discussions that would help
to reduce stigma around the issue.

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:33.056
The voices of those directly affected
were at the forefront of the story --

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.306
not the voices of journalists
or commentators on social media.

00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:39.116
And that's why the story was news.

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:42.346
We live in an incredibly
interconnected world

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.270
with the proliferation of social media,

00:06:44.294 --> 00:06:47.927
which is of course a fantastic resource
for igniting social change.

00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:50.678
But it's also made us
increasingly reactive,

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:54.089
from the smallest annoyances
of, "Oh, my train's been delayed,"

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:58.484
to the greatest injustices of war,
genocides, terrorist attacks.

00:06:58.508 --> 00:07:02.006
Our default response has become
to leap to react to any kind of grievance

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.178
by tweeting, Facebooking, hastagging --

00:07:04.202 --> 00:07:06.854
anything to show others
that we, too, have reacted.

00:07:07.798 --> 00:07:10.111
The problem with reacting
in this manner en masse

00:07:10.135 --> 00:07:13.056
is it can sometimes mean
that we don't actually react at all,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.529
not in the sense of actually
doing anything, anyway.

00:07:15.553 --> 00:07:17.291
It might make ourselves feel better,

00:07:17.315 --> 00:07:19.866
like we've contributed
to a group mourning or outrage,

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.852
but it doesn't actually change anything.

00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:23.040
And what's more,

00:07:23.064 --> 00:07:24.868
it can sometimes drown out the voices

00:07:24.892 --> 00:07:26.990
of those directly
affected by the injustice,

00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:28.593
whose needs must be heard.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.633
Worrying, too, is the tendency
for some reactions to injustice

00:07:33.657 --> 00:07:35.254
to build even more walls,

00:07:35.278 --> 00:07:38.640
being quick to point fingers
with the hope of providing easy solutions

00:07:38.664 --> 00:07:39.857
to complex problems.

00:07:40.328 --> 00:07:42.867
One British tabloid,
on the publication of my letter,

00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:44.420
branded a headline stating,

00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:48.101
"Oxford Student Launches
Online Campaign to Shame Attacker."

00:07:49.567 --> 00:07:51.834
But the campaign never
meant to shame anyone.

00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:55.384
It meant to let people speak
and to make others listen.

00:07:56.186 --> 00:07:59.600
Divisive Twitter trolls were quick
to create even more injustice,

00:07:59.624 --> 00:08:02.574
commenting on
my attacker's ethnicity or class

00:08:02.598 --> 00:08:04.835
to push their own prejudiced agendas.

00:08:05.381 --> 00:08:08.842
And some even accused me
of feigning the whole thing

00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:10.972
to push, and I quote,

00:08:10.996 --> 00:08:14.810
my "feminist agenda of man-hating."

00:08:14.834 --> 00:08:15.896
(Laughter)

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.080
I know, right?

00:08:17.104 --> 00:08:19.969
As if I'm going to be like,
"Hey guys! Sorry I can't make it,

00:08:19.993 --> 00:08:22.358
I'm busy trying to hate
the entire male population

00:08:22.382 --> 00:08:23.767
by the time I'm 30."

00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:24.929
(Laughter)

00:08:24.953 --> 00:08:27.001
Now, I'm almost sure

00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:29.997
that these people wouldn't say
the things they say in person.

00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:32.783
But it's as if because they might
be behind a screen,

00:08:32.807 --> 00:08:34.366
in the comfort in their own home

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.541
when on social media,

00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:38.219
people forget that what
they're doing is a public act --

00:08:38.243 --> 00:08:41.019
that other people will be reading it
and be affected by it.

00:08:41.043 --> 00:08:43.772
Returning to my analogy
of getting back on our trains,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.473
another main concern I have
about this noise that escalates

00:08:47.497 --> 00:08:49.373
from our online responses to injustice

00:08:49.397 --> 00:08:52.872
is that it can very easily slip
into portraying us as the affected party,

00:08:52.896 --> 00:08:54.916
which can lead to a sense of defeatism,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.659
a kind of mental barrier to seeing
any opportunity for positivity or change

00:08:58.683 --> 00:09:00.258
after a negative situation.

00:09:01.092 --> 00:09:03.327
A couple of months
before the campaign started

00:09:03.351 --> 00:09:04.792
or any of this happened to me,

00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:06.562
I went to a TEDx event in Oxford,

00:09:06.586 --> 00:09:08.521
and I saw Zelda la Grange speak,

00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:10.806
the former private secretary
to Nelson Mandela.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.975
One of the stories
she told really struck me.

00:09:13.755 --> 00:09:15.824
She spoke of when
Mandela was taken to court

00:09:15.848 --> 00:09:17.438
by the South African Rugby Union

00:09:17.462 --> 00:09:20.013
after he commissioned
an inquiry into sports affairs.

00:09:20.037 --> 00:09:21.188
In the courtroom,

00:09:21.212 --> 00:09:24.203
he went up to the South African
Rugby Union's lawyers,

00:09:24.227 --> 00:09:25.387
shook them by the hand

00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:27.854
and conversed with them,
each in their own language.

00:09:27.878 --> 00:09:29.218
And Zelda wanted to protest,

00:09:29.242 --> 00:09:31.149
saying they had no right to his respect

00:09:31.173 --> 00:09:33.448
after this injustice they had caused him.

00:09:33.837 --> 00:09:35.549
He turned to her and said,

00:09:36.324 --> 00:09:40.453
"You must never allow the enemy
to determine the grounds for battle."

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.610
At the time of hearing these words,

00:09:43.634 --> 00:09:45.902
I didn't really know why
they were so important,

00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:49.287
but I felt they were, and I wrote them
down in a notebook I had on me.

00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:51.808
But I've thought about this line
a lot ever since.

00:09:52.198 --> 00:09:54.715
Revenge, or the expression of hatred

00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:56.675
towards those who have done us injustice

00:09:56.699 --> 00:09:59.713
may feel like a human instinct
in the face of wrong,

00:09:59.737 --> 00:10:01.651
but we need to break out of these cycles

00:10:01.675 --> 00:10:04.783
if we are to hope to transform
negative events of injustice

00:10:04.807 --> 00:10:06.510
into positive social change.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.079
To do otherwise

00:10:08.103 --> 00:10:11.382
continues to let the enemy
determine the grounds for battle,

00:10:11.406 --> 00:10:12.592
creates a binary,

00:10:12.616 --> 00:10:15.120
where we who have suffered
become the affected,

00:10:15.144 --> 00:10:17.524
pitted against them, the perpetrators.

00:10:18.143 --> 00:10:20.013
And just like we got back on our tubes,

00:10:20.037 --> 00:10:23.073
we can't let our platforms
for interconnectivity and community

00:10:23.097 --> 00:10:25.169
be the places that we settle for defeat.

00:10:27.072 --> 00:10:30.588
But I don't want to discourage
a social media response,

00:10:30.612 --> 00:10:33.279
because I owe the development
of the #NotGuilty campaign

00:10:33.303 --> 00:10:34.847
almost entirely to social media.

00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:37.396
But I do want to encourage
a more considered approach

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.543
to the way we use it
to respond to injustice.

00:10:39.567 --> 00:10:42.018
The start, I think,
is to ask ourselves two things.

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:44.574
Firstly: Why do I feel this injustice?

00:10:44.598 --> 00:10:46.904
In my case, there were
several answers to this.

00:10:46.928 --> 00:10:49.161
Someone had hurt me and those who I loved,

00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:52.085
under the assumption they
wouldn't have to be held to account

00:10:52.109 --> 00:10:54.022
or recognize the damage they had caused.

00:10:54.046 --> 00:10:56.954
Not only that, but thousands
of men and women suffer every day

00:10:56.978 --> 00:10:58.696
from sexual abuse, often in silence,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.272
yet it's still a problem we don't give
the same airtime to as other issues.

00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:04.816
It's still an issue many people
blame victims for.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.122
Next, ask yourself: How,
in recognizing these reasons,

00:11:08.146 --> 00:11:09.822
could I go about reversing them?

00:11:10.183 --> 00:11:13.771
With us, this was holding my attacker
to account -- and many others.

00:11:13.795 --> 00:11:16.401
It was calling them out
on the effect they had caused.

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:19.159
It was giving airtime
to the issue of sexual assault,

00:11:19.183 --> 00:11:22.544
opening up discussions amongst friends,
amongst families, in the media

00:11:22.568 --> 00:11:24.209
that had been closed for too long,

00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:26.590
and stressing that victims
shouldn't feel to blame

00:11:26.614 --> 00:11:27.885
for what happened to them.

00:11:27.909 --> 00:11:31.227
We might still have a long way to go
in solving this problem entirely.

00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:32.402
But in this way,

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:35.737
we can begin to use social media
as an active tool for social justice,

00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:37.859
as a tool to educate,
to stimulate dialogues,

00:11:37.883 --> 00:11:40.568
to make those in positions
of authority aware of an issue

00:11:40.592 --> 00:11:43.113
by listening to those
directly affected by it.

00:11:44.112 --> 00:11:48.582
Because sometimes these questions
don't have easy answers.

00:11:48.606 --> 00:11:50.272
In fact, they rarely do.

00:11:50.715 --> 00:11:53.979
But this doesn't mean we still
can't give them a considered response.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.574
In situations where
you can't go about thinking

00:11:56.598 --> 00:11:58.693
how you'd reverse
this feeling of injustice,

00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:01.371
you can still think,
maybe not what you can do,

00:12:01.395 --> 00:12:02.944
but what you can not do.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:07.373
You can not build further walls
by fighting injustice with more prejudice,

00:12:07.397 --> 00:12:08.559
more hatred.

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:12.736
You can not speak over those
directly affected by an injustice.

00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:17.100
And you can not react to injustice,
only to forget about it the next day,

00:12:17.124 --> 00:12:19.432
just because the rest
of Twitter has moved on.

00:12:20.078 --> 00:12:24.265
Sometimes not reacting
instantly is, ironically,

00:12:24.289 --> 00:12:26.683
the best immediate course
of action we can take.

00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:31.729
Because we might be angry, upset
and energized by injustice,

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:34.522
but let's consider our responses.

00:12:35.413 --> 00:12:38.649
Let us hold people to account,
without descending into a culture

00:12:38.673 --> 00:12:41.459
that thrives off shaming
and injustice ourselves.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.992
Let us remember that distinction,

00:12:44.016 --> 00:12:46.214
so often forgotten by internet users,

00:12:46.238 --> 00:12:48.678
between criticism and insult.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.346
Let us not forget
to think before we speak,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.787
just because we might
have a screen in front of us.

00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:55.782
And when we create noise on social media,

00:12:55.806 --> 00:12:58.124
let it not drown out the needs
of those affected,

00:12:58.148 --> 00:13:00.589
but instead let it amplify their voices,

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.555
so the internet becomes a place
where you're not the exception

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:06.747
if you speak out about something
that has actually happened to you.

00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:08.824
All these considered
approaches to injustice

00:13:08.848 --> 00:13:11.544
evoke the very keystones
on which the internet was built:

00:13:12.317 --> 00:13:14.572
to network, to have signal, to connect --

00:13:14.596 --> 00:13:17.088
all these terms that imply
bringing people together,

00:13:17.112 --> 00:13:18.335
not pushing people apart.

00:13:19.443 --> 00:13:23.165
Because if you look up the word
"justice" in the dictionary,

00:13:23.977 --> 00:13:25.243
before punishment,

00:13:25.267 --> 00:13:28.543
before administration of law
or judicial authority,

00:13:29.529 --> 00:13:30.775
you get:

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:32.911
"The maintenance of what is right."

00:13:33.794 --> 00:13:37.560
And I think there are few things
more "right" in this world

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:39.320
than bringing people together,

00:13:39.344 --> 00:13:40.646
than unions.

00:13:41.395 --> 00:13:43.892
And if we allow social media
to deliver that,

00:13:43.916 --> 00:13:47.854
then it can deliver a very powerful
form of justice, indeed.

00:13:48.477 --> 00:13:49.706
Thank you very much.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:56.615
(Applause)
