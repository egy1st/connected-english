00:00:01.436 --> 00:00:04.643
One hot October morning,

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:07.377
I got off the all-night train

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:08.559
in Mandalay,

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:11.701
the old royal capital of Burma,

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:13.142
now Myanmar.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.858
And out on the street, I ran into
a group of rough men

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:21.775
standing beside their bicycle rickshaws.

00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:23.169
And one of them came up

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:25.375
and offered to show me around.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:29.279
The price he quoted was outrageous.

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:33.820
It was less than I would pay
for a bar of chocolate at home.

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:36.985
So I clambered into his trishaw,

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:42.880
and he began pedaling us slowly
between palaces and pagodas.

00:00:43.972 --> 00:00:49.271
And as he did, he told me how
he had come to the city from his village.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:51.674
He'd earned a degree in mathematics.

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:54.025
His dream was to be a teacher.

00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:59.257
But of course, life is hard
under a military dictatorship,

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:03.401
and so for now, this was the only way
he could make a living.

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:08.737
Many nights, he told me,
he actually slept in his trishaw

00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:13.147
so he could catch the first visitors
off the all-night train.

00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:19.392
And very soon, we found
that in certain ways,

00:01:19.416 --> 00:01:21.082
we had so much in common --

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:22.967
we were both in our 20s,

00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:26.203
we were both fascinated
by foreign cultures --

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:28.658
that he invited me home.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:33.863
So we turned off the wide,
crowded streets,

00:01:33.887 --> 00:01:38.097
and we began bumping
down rough, wild alleyways.

00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:40.469
There were broken shacks all around.

00:01:40.493 --> 00:01:43.335
I really lost the sense of where I was,

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:47.818
and I realized that anything
could happen to me now.

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:50.284
I could get mugged or drugged

00:01:50.308 --> 00:01:51.624
or something worse.

00:01:51.648 --> 00:01:53.032
Nobody would know.

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:58.006
Finally, he stopped and led me into a hut,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.354
which consisted of just one tiny room.

00:02:02.228 --> 00:02:04.405
And then he leaned down,

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.371
and reached under his bed.

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:09.786
And something in me froze.

00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:14.746
I waited to see what he would pull out.

00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:18.371
And finally he extracted a box.

00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:24.226
Inside it was every single letter
he had ever received

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.291
from visitors from abroad,

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:29.103
and on some of them he had pasted

00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:32.518
little black-and-white worn snapshots

00:02:32.542 --> 00:02:34.746
of his new foreign friends.

00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:40.014
So when we said goodbye that night,

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:42.625
I realized he had also shown me

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.959
the secret point of travel,

00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:47.039
which is to take a plunge,

00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:49.755
to go inwardly as well as outwardly

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.294
to places you would never go otherwise,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.498
to venture into uncertainty,

00:02:55.928 --> 00:02:57.101
ambiguity,

00:02:57.498 --> 00:02:58.780
even fear.

00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:02.737
At home, it's dangerously easy

00:03:02.761 --> 00:03:04.971
to assume we're on top of things.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.822
Out in the world, you are reminded
every moment that you're not,

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.855
and you can't get to the bottom
of things, either.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:17.137
Everywhere, "People wish to be settled,"

00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:19.440
Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us,

00:03:19.464 --> 00:03:22.140
"but only insofar
as we are unsettled

00:03:22.164 --> 00:03:23.850
is there any hope for us."

00:03:24.891 --> 00:03:27.318
At this conference,
we've been lucky enough

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:30.795
to hear some exhilarating
new ideas and discoveries

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.575
and, really, about all the ways

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.922
in which knowledge is being
pushed excitingly forwards.

00:03:36.797 --> 00:03:40.026
But at some point, knowledge gives out.

00:03:40.802 --> 00:03:42.026
And that is the moment

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.685
when your life is truly decided:

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.507
you fall in love;

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:49.928
you lose a friend;

00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:52.465
the lights go out.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.014
And it's then, when you're lost
or uneasy or carried out of yourself,

00:03:58.038 --> 00:04:00.200
that you find out who you are.

00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:05.552
I don't believe that ignorance is bliss.

00:04:06.193 --> 00:04:09.324
Science has unquestionably made our lives

00:04:09.348 --> 00:04:11.816
brighter and longer and healthier.

00:04:12.825 --> 00:04:17.652
And I am forever grateful to the teachers
who showed me the laws of physics

00:04:17.676 --> 00:04:21.189
and pointed out that
three times three makes nine.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.503
I can count that out on my fingers

00:04:24.527 --> 00:04:26.869
any time of night or day.

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:30.414
But when a mathematician tells me

00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:33.961
that minus three times
minus three makes nine,

00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:38.854
that's a kind of logic
that almost feels like trust.

00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:44.435
The opposite of knowledge, in other words,
isn't always ignorance.

00:04:44.948 --> 00:04:46.098
It can be wonder.

00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:47.632
Or mystery.

00:04:47.964 --> 00:04:49.147
Possibility.

00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:53.731
And in my life, I've found
it's the things I don't know

00:04:53.755 --> 00:04:56.434
that have lifted me up
and pushed me forwards

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:59.026
much more than the things I do know.

00:05:00.222 --> 00:05:02.021
It's also the things I don't know

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:05.439
that have often brought me closer
to everybody around me.

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:08.549
For eight straight Novembers, recently,

00:05:08.573 --> 00:05:13.001
I traveled every year across Japan
with the Dalai Lama.

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:17.101
And the one thing he said every day

00:05:17.125 --> 00:05:20.672
that most seemed to give people
reassurance and confidence

00:05:20.696 --> 00:05:22.754
was, "I don't know."

00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:26.202
"What's going to happen to Tibet?"

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:30.206
"When are we ever
going to get world peace?"

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:32.826
"What's the best way to raise children?"

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:37.205
"Frankly," says this very wise man,

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.466
"I don't know."

00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:43.818
The Nobel Prize-winning
economist Daniel Kahneman

00:05:43.842 --> 00:05:48.345
has spent more than 60 years now
researching human behavior,

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:50.401
and his conclusion is

00:05:50.425 --> 00:05:55.039
that we are always much more confident
of what we think we know

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.788
than we should be.

00:05:56.812 --> 00:05:59.471
We have, as he memorably puts it,

00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:03.699
an "unlimited ability
to ignore our ignorance."

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.936
We know -- quote, unquote -- our team
is going to win this weekend,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.129
and we only remember that knowledge

00:06:12.153 --> 00:06:14.502
on the rare occasions when we're right.

00:06:15.582 --> 00:06:18.425
Most of the time, we're in the dark.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.794
And that's where real intimacy lies.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.513
Do you know what your lover
is going to do tomorrow?

00:06:28.673 --> 00:06:29.946
Do you want to know?

00:06:31.621 --> 00:06:34.434
The parents of us all,
as some people call them,

00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:35.617
Adam and Eve,

00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:39.799
could never die, so long as they
were eating from the tree of life.

00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:42.829
But the minute they began nibbling

00:06:42.853 --> 00:06:45.435
from the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil,

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:47.263
they fell from their innocence.

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:50.833
They grew embarrassed and fretful,

00:06:50.857 --> 00:06:52.054
self-conscious.

00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:55.233
And they learned,
a little too late, perhaps,

00:06:55.257 --> 00:06:57.997
that there are certainly some things
that we need to know,

00:06:58.021 --> 00:07:01.968
but there are many, many more
that are better left unexplored.

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:05.924
Now, when I was a kid,

00:07:05.948 --> 00:07:09.266
I knew it all, of course.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.502
I had been spending 20 years
in classrooms collecting facts,

00:07:13.526 --> 00:07:16.245
and I was actually
in the information business,

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.419
writing articles for Time Magazine.

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:24.305
And I took my first real trip to Japan
for two-and-a-half weeks,

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:27.609
and I came back with a 40-page essay

00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:31.197
explaining every last detail
about Japan's temples,

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.903
its fashions, its baseball games,

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.649
its soul.

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:39.606
But underneath all that,

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.807
something that I couldn't understand

00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:47.325
so moved me for reasons
I couldn't explain to you yet,

00:07:48.087 --> 00:07:51.296
that I decided to go and live in Japan.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.201
And now that I've been there for 28 years,

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.625
I really couldn't tell you
very much at all

00:07:57.649 --> 00:07:59.313
about my adopted home.

00:08:00.222 --> 00:08:01.569
Which is wonderful,

00:08:01.593 --> 00:08:04.473
because it means every day
I'm making some new discovery,

00:08:04.497 --> 00:08:05.988
and in the process,

00:08:06.012 --> 00:08:09.906
looking around the corner
and seeing the hundred thousand things

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.231
I'll never know.

00:08:12.964 --> 00:08:15.430
Knowledge is a priceless gift.

00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:21.007
But the illusion of knowledge
can be more dangerous than ignorance.

00:08:21.895 --> 00:08:24.528
Thinking that you know your lover

00:08:25.115 --> 00:08:26.272
or your enemy

00:08:26.621 --> 00:08:28.076
can be more treacherous

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.548
than acknowledging you'll never know them.

00:08:31.937 --> 00:08:36.409
Every morning in Japan, as the sun
is flooding into our little apartment,

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:40.791
I take great pains not to consult
the weather forecast,

00:08:40.815 --> 00:08:42.453
because if I do,

00:08:42.477 --> 00:08:45.740
my mind will be overclouded, distracted,

00:08:45.764 --> 00:08:48.278
even when the day is bright.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.353
I've been a full-time
writer now for 34 years.

00:08:54.816 --> 00:08:57.696
And the one thing that I have learned

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.256
is that transformation comes
when I'm not in charge,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.457
when I don't know what's coming next,

00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:08.008
when I can't assume I am bigger
than everything around me.

00:09:09.191 --> 00:09:11.097
And the same is true in love

00:09:11.643 --> 00:09:13.919
or in moments of crisis.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:18.371
Suddenly, we're back in that trishaw again

00:09:18.395 --> 00:09:22.430
and we're bumping off the broad,
well-lit streets;

00:09:22.454 --> 00:09:26.118
and we're reminded, really,
of the first law of travel

00:09:26.142 --> 00:09:27.868
and, therefore, of life:

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.829
you're only as strong
as your readiness to surrender.

00:09:35.512 --> 00:09:37.521
In the end, perhaps,

00:09:37.545 --> 00:09:38.739
being human

00:09:39.262 --> 00:09:41.015
is much more important

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.694
than being fully in the know.

00:09:44.763 --> 00:09:45.949
Thank you.

00:09:45.973 --> 00:09:52.596
(Applause)
