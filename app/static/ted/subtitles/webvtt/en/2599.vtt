00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.735
"We're declaring war against cancer,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.360
and we will win this war by 2015."

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.176
This is what the US Congress
and the National Cancer Institute declared

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.760
just a few years ago, in 2003.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.656
Now, I don't know about you,
but I don't buy that.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.736
I don't think we quite won this war yet,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.400
and I don't think
anyone here will question that.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.296
Now, I will argue that a primary reason

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.456
why we're not winning
this war against cancer

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.776
is because we're fighting blindly.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.375
I'm going to start by sharing with you
a story about a good friend of mine.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.616
His name is Ehud,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.776
and a few years ago,
Ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.656
And not just any type of brain cancer:

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.856
he was diagnosed with one
of the most deadly forms of brain cancer.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.096
In fact, it was so deadly

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.776
that the doctors told him
that they only have 12 months,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.216
and during those 12 months,
they have to find a treatment.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.696
They have to find a cure,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.880
and if they cannot
find a cure, he will die.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.256
Now, the good news, they said,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.216
is that there are tons
of different treatments to choose from,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.456
but the bad news is

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.016
that in order for them to tell
if a treatment is even working or not,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.536
well, that takes them
about three months or so.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.936
So they cannot try that many things.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.056
Well, Ehud is now going
into his first treatment,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.336
and during that first treatment,
just a few days into that treatment,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.696
I'm meeting with him, and he tells me,
"Adam, I think this is working.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.536
I think we really lucked out here.
Something is happening."

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.016
And I ask him, "Really?
How do you know that, Ehud?"

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.256
And he says, "Well,
I feel so terrible inside.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.136
Something's gotta be working up there.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.376
It just has to."

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.840
Well, unfortunately, three months later,
we got the news, it didn't work.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.576
And so Ehud goes
into his second treatment.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.856
And again, the same story.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.616
"It feels so bad, something's
gotta be working there."

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.576
And then three months later,
again we get bad news.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.536
Ehud is going into his third treatment,
and then his fourth treatment.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.080
And then, as predicted, Ehud dies.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.376
Now, when someone really close to you
is going through such a huge struggle,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.216
you get really swamped with emotions.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.336
A lot of things
are going through your head.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.816
For me, it was mostly outrage.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.536
I was just outraged that, how come
this is the best that we can offer?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.856
And I started looking
more and more into this.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.336
As it turns out, this is not just
the best that doctors could offer Ehud.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.176
It's not just the best doctors could offer
patients with brain cancer generally.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.400
We're actually not doing that well
all across the board with cancer.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.096
I picked up one of those statistics,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.896
and I'm sure some of you
have seen those statistics before.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.376
This is going to show you here
how many patients actually died of cancer,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.416
in this case females in the United States,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.736
ever since the 1930s.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.936
You'll notice that there aren't
that many things that have changed.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.256
It's still a huge issue.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.016
You'll see a few changes, though.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.576
You'll see lung cancer,
for example, on the rise.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.800
Thank you, cigarettes.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.856
And you'll also see that,
for example, stomach cancer

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.216
once used to be one
of the biggest killers of all cancers,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.680
is essentially eliminated.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.536
Now, why is that?
Anyone knows, by the way?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.896
Why is it that humanity is no longer
struck by stomach cancer?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.776
What was the huge, huge
medical technology breakthrough

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.160
that came to our world
that saved humanity from stomach cancer?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.056
Was it maybe a new drug,
or a better diagnostic?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.376
You guys are right, yeah.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.016
It's the invention of the refrigerator,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.656
and the fact that we're
no longer eating spoiled meats.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.976
So the best thing
that happened to us so far

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.936
in the medical arena in cancer research

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.151
is the fact that
the refrigerator was invented.

00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:21.376
(Laughter)

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.656
And so -- yeah, I know.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.096
We're not doing so well here.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.456
I don't want to miniaturize the progress

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.856
and everything that's been done
in cancer research.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.296
Look, there is like 50-plus years
of good cancer research

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.736
that discovered major, major things
that taught us about cancer.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.496
But all that said,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.092
we have a lot of heavy lifting
to still do ahead of us.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.016
Again, I will argue that the primary
reason why this is the case,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.040
why we have not done that remarkably well,

00:03:48.064 --> 00:03:49.896
is really we're fighting blindly here.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.136
And this is where
medical imaging comes in.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.840
This is where my own work comes in.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.136
And so to give you a sense
of the best medical imaging

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.656
that's offered today
to brain cancer patients,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.856
or actually generally
to all cancer patients,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.816
take a look at this PET scan right here.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.080
Let's see. There we go.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.336
So this is a PET/CT scan,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.816
and what you'll see in this PET/CT scan

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.056
is the CT scan will show you
where the bones are,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.480
and the PET scan will show you
where tumors are.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.176
Now, what you can see here

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.616
is essentially a sugar molecule

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.456
that was added a small little tag

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.576
that is signaling to us
outside of the body,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.896
"Hey, I'm here."

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.736
And those sugar molecules are injected
into these patients by the billions,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.456
and they're going all over the body

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.560
looking for cells
that are hungry for sugar.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.976
You'll see that the heart,
for example, lights up there.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.216
That's because the heart
needs a lot of sugar.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.576
You'll also see that the bladder
lights up there.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.216
That's because the bladder
is the thing that's clearing

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.640
the sugar away from our body.

00:04:46.096 --> 00:04:48.096
And then you'll see a few other hot spots,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.736
and these are in fact the tumors.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.896
Now, this is a really
a wonderful technology.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.056
For the first time it allowed us
to look into someone's body

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.456
without picking up
each and every one of the cells

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.336
and putting them under the microscope,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.376
but in a noninvasive way
allowing us to look into someone's body

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.536
and ask, "Hey,
has the cancer metastasized?

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.776
Where is it?"

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.296
And the PET scans here
are showing you very clearly

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.600
where are these hot spots,
where is the tumor.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.776
So as miraculous as this might seem,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.680
unfortunately, well, it's not that great.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.400
You see, those
small little hot spots there.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.760
Can anyone guess how many cancer cells
are in any one of these tumors?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.936
So it's about 100 million cancer cells,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.656
and let me make sure
that this number sunk in.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.016
In each and every one
of these small little blips

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.616
that you're seeing on the image,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.736
there needs to be
at least 100 million cancer cells

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.296
in order for it to be detected.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.776
Now, if that seemed to you
like a very large number,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.480
it is a very large number.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.696
This is in fact
an incredibly large number,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.056
because what we really need
in order to pick up something early enough

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.016
to do something about it,
to do something meaningful about it,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.176
well, we need to pick up tumors
that are a thousand cells in size,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.336
and ideally just
a handful of cells in size.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.376
So we're clearly
pretty far away from this.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.656
So we're going to play
a little experiment here.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.136
I'm going to ask each of you
to now play and imagine

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.520
that you are brain surgeons.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.016
And you guys are now at an operating room,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.056
and there's a patient in front of you,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.800
and your task is to make sure
that the tumor is out.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.776
So you're looking down at the patient,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.136
the skin and the skull
have already been removed,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.696
so you're looking at the brain.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.416
And all you know about this patient

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.256
is that there's a tumor
about the size of a golf ball or so

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.600
in the right frontal lobe
of this person's brain.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.416
And that's more or less it.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.656
So you're looking down, and unfortunately
everything looks the same,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.776
because brain cancer tissue
and healthy brain tissue

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.376
really just look the same.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.296
And so you're going in with your thumb,

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.656
and you start to press
a little bit on the brain,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.096
because tumors tend to be
a little harder, stiffer,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.736
and so you go in and go
a little bit like this and say,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.736
"It seems like the tumor is right there."

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.416
Then you take out your knife
and start cutting the tumor

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.696
piece by piece by piece.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.416
And as you're taking the tumor out,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.656
then you're getting
to a stage where you think,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.816
"Alright, I'm done.
I took out everything."

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.376
And at this stage, if that's --

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.096
so far everything sounded,
like, pretty crazy --

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.816
you're now about to face the most
challenging decision of your life here.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.376
Because now you need to decide,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.096
should I stop here
and let this patient go,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.056
risking that there might be
some leftover cancer cells behind

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.936
that I just couldn't see,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.616
or should I take away some extra margins,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.496
typically about an inch or so
around the tumor

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.720
just to be sure that I removed everything?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.240
So this is not a simple decision to make,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.776
and unfortunately this is the decision

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.136
that brain cancer surgeons
have to take every single day

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.760
as they're seeing their patients.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.256
And so I remember talking
to a few friends of mine in the lab,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.656
and we say, "Boy,
there's got to be a better way."

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.096
But not just like you tell a friend
that there's got to be a better way.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.073
There's just got to be a better way here.

00:07:54.097 --> 00:07:55.616
This is just incredible.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.296
And so we looked back.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.296
Remember those PET scans I told you about,
the sugar and so on.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.056
We said, hey, how about
instead of using sugar molecules,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.216
let's maybe take tiny, tiny
little particles made of gold,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.896
and let's program them with some
interesting chemistry around them.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.336
Let's program them
to look for cancer cells.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.456
And then we will inject
these gold particles

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.736
into these patients by the billions again,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.736
and we'll have them go all over the body,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.736
and just like secret agents, if you will,

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.576
go and walk by
every single cell in our body

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.296
and knock on the door of that cell,

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.056
and ask, "Are you a cancer cell
or are you a healthy cell?

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.096
If you're a healthy cell, we're moving on.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.856
If you're a cancer cell,
we're sticking in and shining out

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.976
and telling us,
"Hey, look at me, I'm here."

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.376
And they'll do it
through some interesting cameras

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.816
that we developed in the lab.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.775
And once we see that,
maybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:45.200
towards taking only the tumor
and leaving the healthy brain alone.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.776
And so we've tested that,
and boy, this works well.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.776
So I'm going to show you an example now.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.576
What you're looking at here

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.536
is an image of a mouse's brain,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.696
and we've implanted
into this mouse's brain

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.976
a small little tumor.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.616
And so this tumor is now
growing in this mouse's brain,

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.296
and then we've taken a doctor
and asked the doctor

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.136
to please operate on the mouse
as if that was a patient,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.576
and take out piece by piece
out of the tumor.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.376
And while he's doing that,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.376
we're going to take images
to see where the gold particles are.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.016
And so we're going to first start

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.456
by injecting these gold particles
into this mouse,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.376
and we're going to see
right here at the very left there

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.656
that image at the bottom

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.176
is the image that shows
where the gold particles are.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.256
The nice thing
is that these gold particles

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.296
actually made it all the way to the tumor,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.976
and then they shine out and tell us,
"Hey, we're here. Here's the tumor."

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.376
So now we can see the tumor,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.536
but we're not showing this
to the doctor yet.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.616
We're asking the doctor,
now please start cutting away the tumor,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.056
and you'll see here the doctor
just took the first quadrant of the tumor

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.296
and you see that first quadrant
is now missing.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.776
The doctor then took
the second quadrant, the third,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.536
and now it appears to be everything.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.296
And so at this stage,
the doctor came back to us and said,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.576
"Alright, I'm done.
What do you want me to do?

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.176
Should I keep things as they are

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.696
or do you want me to take
some extra margins around?"

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.376
And then we said, "Well, hang on."

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.816
We told the doctor,
"You've missed those two spots,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.840
so rather than taking huge margins around,

00:10:06.864 --> 00:10:08.696
only take out those tiny little areas.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.736
Take them out,
and then let's take a look."

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.616
And so the doctor took them away,
and lo and behold,

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.656
the cancer is now completely gone.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.056
Now, the important thing

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.700
is that it's not just
that the cancer is completely gone

00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:21.056
from this person's brain,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.400
or from this mouse's brain.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.416
The most important thing

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.336
is that we did not have to take
huge amounts of healthy brain

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.576
in the process.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.776
And so now we can actually imagine a world

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.696
where doctors and surgeons,
as they take away a tumor,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.140
they actually know what to take out,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.280
and they no longer
have to guess with their thumb.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.456
Now, here's why it's extremely important
to take those tiny little leftover tumors.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.336
Those leftover tumors,
even if it's just a handful of cells,

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.416
they will grow to recur the tumor,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.096
for the tumor to come back.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.056
In fact, the reason why 80 to 90 percent

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.296
of those brain cancer surgeries
ultimately fail

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.096
is because of those small little
extra margins that were left positive,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.800
those small little leftover tumors
that were left there.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.616
So this is clearly very nice,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.936
but what I really want to share with you
is where I think we're heading from here.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.616
And so in my lab at Stanford,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.160
my students and I are asking,
what should we be working on now?

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.456
And I think where
medical imaging is heading to

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.816
is the ability to look into the human body

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.280
and actually see each and every one
of these cells separately.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.736
The ability like this would allow us

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.656
to actually pick up tumors
way, way earlier in the process,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.600
way before it's 100 million cells inside,
so we can actually do something about it.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.616
An ability to see each and every one
of the cells might also allow us

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.016
to ask insightful questions.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.136
So in the lab,
we are now getting to a point

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.416
where we can actually start asking
these cancer cells real questions,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.216
like, for example, are you responding
to the treatment we are giving you or not?

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.696
So if you're not responding, we'll know
to stop the treatment right away,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.760
days into the treatment, not three months.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.656
And so also for patients like Ehud

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.096
that are going through these
nasty, nasty chemotherapy drugs,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.376
for them not to suffer

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.296
through those horrendous
side effects of the drugs

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.976
when the drugs are
in fact not even helping them.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.936
So to be frank here,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.416
we're pretty far away
from winning the war against cancer,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.696
just to be realistic.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.616
But at least I am hopeful

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.776
that we should be able to fight this war
with better medical imaging techniques

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.656
in the way that is not blind.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.896
Thank you.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.160
(Applause)
