00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I started juggling a long time ago,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And as a golfer and as a kid,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that I sort of lived my whole life, is process.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And it's the process of learning things.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And he had a real passion for golf,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and he also created this whole mythology

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
about Ben Hogan and various things.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Well, I learned a lot about interesting things

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And that was the mythology of skill.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
with the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But I'm going to explore skill, and juggling,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and basically visual music, I guess.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
OK, you can start the music, thanks.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:04:10.000
(Music)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
(Applause)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Thanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun;

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
play with skill and play with space, play with rhythm.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I do a big piece in a triangle

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and these are three sections from it.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
but using the rhythm of my body and feet,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and controlling the balls with my feet.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
(Applause)

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Thanks. Now, this next section was an attempt to explore space.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
You see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Well, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it's a process of joining with forces.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
how to join with the space through the technique.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So juggling gravity -- up, down.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
If you figure out what up and down really are,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
it's a complex physical set of skills

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
but then you add in sideways.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
(Applause)

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Now, I look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
what you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your hands

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
because you're not looking at your hands,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
with the obvious reference to the feet,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
but it's also time -- where the feet were, where the balls were.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:17.000
(Applause)

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Thanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I'm going to build towards complexity now.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Juggling three balls is simple and normal.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
(Laughter)

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Excuse me.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
(Laughter)

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
We're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
you're getting into a subculture here.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
(Laughter)

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And juggling -- the balls cross and all that.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
OK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
of different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And you can change the rhythm -- good, Michael.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
OK? Change the rhythm, so it's even.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Or you can go back and change the height. Now, skill.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
But you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So, you've got to go after the space down there.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
OK, then you've got to combine them,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And then you get crazy.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Applause)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
so you've got to pay attention. Complexity:

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
if you spend enough time doing something, time slows down

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
or your skill increases, so your perceptions change.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
It's learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
You may not be able to affect it, it almost drifts on you. It goes.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
But that's the closest approximation I can have to it.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
OK? And whoever laughed there --

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
you understood it completely, right?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
(Laughter)

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
No, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
who's got his hands around that mess, OK.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Well, that's what juggling is about, right?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
All right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
OK? Another way is the outside.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And you could play with the rhythm.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Same pattern.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Make it faster and smaller.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Make it wider.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Make it narrower.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Bring it back up.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
OK. It's done. Thanks.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
(Applause)

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Now, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
but let's try something.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
OK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I'm going to give you a little clue.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Enough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
(Laughter)

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
You're not getting off that easy. All right?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Now, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Green.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Yellow.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Pink.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
White.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
OK, you can do that? Yeah? OK.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Now, let's actually learn something.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Actually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
You want to do it? Yeah? OK.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Hands out in front of you. Palms up, together.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
What you're going to learn is this.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
(Laughter)

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
OK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Index finger, middle finger, ring, little.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Little, ring, middle, index. And then open.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
A little bit faster.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
(Laughter)

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
All right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
(Laughter)

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
One learning process that I see is this --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
(Laughter)

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
OK. Another learning process that I see is this --

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
(Laughter)

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
OK. So, everybody take a deep breath in, breath out. OK.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Now, one more time, and --

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. OK.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Shake your hands out.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Now, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
OK? So, what you're doing is, you're going la, la, la,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and you're getting this. OK?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So what I want you to do is -- fingers.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
But I want you to do is also, with your eyes,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
(Laughter)

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
OK? Here we go.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So, we're going to start off looking at the white ball --

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and I'm going to tell you which color,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So white ball and --

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Green.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Finger, finger, finger, finger. Yellow.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Finger, finger, finger, pink or finger.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Pink, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
All right.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
(Applause)

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
How did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
a moment of learning, a moment of challenge.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
It's a moment that you can't make sense of.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Why the hell should I learn this? OK?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
You know, I can't decipher -- is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
(Laughter)

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
You know, what are you supposed to do?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
You've got somebody up here who is the operative principle

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
of doing that for his whole life. OK?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Trying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
It's just a moment. That's all it is, a moment. OK?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
I don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
a moment. And what I do as a creative artist

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
What I've done for you here, I developed a lot of those tricks

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and I put the choreography together,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
but they're not original techniques.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Now, I'm going to start showing you some original techniques

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
that come from the work that I've developed. OK?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So, a moment, how would you define a moment?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
that was representational of a moment.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Ahhh.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
All right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
So, a moment.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000
(Rattling)

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
OK? And then, what I did as a juggler was say,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
OK, what can I do to make that something

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
that is dependent on something else, another dynamic.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:50.000
(Rattling)

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
So, a moment.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
(Rattling)

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Another moment.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
(Rattling)

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Excuse me, still getting there. A moment that travels.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
(Rattling)

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
A moment -- no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Time. How can you look at time?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Well, obviously, there's something in here,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
and you can all have a guess as to what it is.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
There's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:49.000
And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Now, this has expanded into a much bigger piece,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
while I'm keeping time with this.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
But I just thought I'd talk about a moment.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
(Applause)

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
All right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Are we ready to do that? Yes?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
This is the piece that I told you about.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
(Applause)

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Thanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
at 120 miles an hour?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
(Laughter)

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
The only other thing is, it was a real shock.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked me

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
that it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Anyway, balance:

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
constant movement to find an approach to stillness.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Cheating.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
(Laughter)

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Balance: making up the rules so you can't cheat,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:06.000
so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:17.000
To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
(Laughter)

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Hup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:28.000
and keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
So, there's a rhythm to it.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
The rhythm can get much smaller.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
As your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
those tinier movements. Thanks.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
(Applause)

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Now, I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
that is about balance in some ways, and also --

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
oh, actually, if you're bored, not here, here's one use for it.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:21.000
(Laughter)

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
You can go with the "Sticks One" music.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:23:53.000
(Music)

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000
(Applause)

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Thanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And they influenced that, and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
"Two Sticks," you can go with it. Thanks.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Which is again exploring space, or the lines in space.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
(Music)

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
(Applause)

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Working with space and the lines in space in a different way.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Oh, let's see here.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
(Applause)

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
So, I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
now, what if you attach something to it, or change it.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
This is a little thing that I made

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
because I really like the idea of curves and balls together.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
And then creating space and the rhythm of space,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
using the surface of the balls, the surface of the arms.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Just a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
which is --

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000
what have I got here? OK. All right.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
I'm actually leading up to something,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
the newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000
(Applause)

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Now, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics --

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
the diameter and the circumference.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Sometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
that I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
of objects that I try to work with.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
The next piece that I'm going to do -- which is the cylinders piece,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
if you want to get that up --

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000
it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
with all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
and the stories that were involved in it,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
as well as the fact that they protected the contents.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
The second influence on this piece came from recycling

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
and looking into a tin can recycling bin

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
and seeing all that beautiful emptiness.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
So, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:31:58.000
(Music)

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
(Applause)

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Talking about geometry and everything,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
if you take the circle and you split it in half --

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
can you run "S-Curve music?"

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
I'm going to do just a short version of it.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Circles split in half and rotated, and mythology.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:33:59.000
(Music)

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000
(Applause)

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Anyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
and I dance around a small stage so --

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
two minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on --

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
what I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
They're not ideas, they're instincts.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
And the latest thing that I'm working on --

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
(Clattering) --

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
is something really -- I don't know what it is yet.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Well, because then it tells me the truth,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
instead of me imposing the truth.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
And what it is, is working with both positive and negative space

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
but also with these curves.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
And what it involves,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
but I'll do a little bit of it.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
It initially started off with me stacking these things,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000
of filling in the space. And then it started changing,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
and become folding on themselves.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
And then changing levels.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Because my attempt is to make visual instruments,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
not to just make -- I'll try one other thing.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000
For work in three dimensions, with your perceptions of space and time.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Now, I don't know exactly where it's going,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And it's going to change as I go through it.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
But I really like it, it feels right.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
This may not be the right shape, and -- look at this shape,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
and then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
just to see, just to play,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
because I love all different kinds of things to play with.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Let's see here.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
To work with the positive and negative in a different way.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
And to change, and to change.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
So, I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
We'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.000
(Applause)
