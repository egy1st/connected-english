WEBVTT

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.096
I'm a painter.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.696
I make large-scale figurative paintings,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.120
which means I paint people

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.039
like this.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.616
But I'm here tonight to tell you
about something personal

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.320
that changed my work and my perspective.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.216
It's something we all go through,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.840
and my hope is that my experience
may be helpful to somebody.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.096
To give you some background on me,
I grew up the youngest of eight.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.296
Yes, eight kids in my family.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.656
I have six older brothers and a sister.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.880
To give you a sense of what that's like,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.736
when my family went on vacation,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.456
we had a bus.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.680
(Laughter)

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.656
My supermom would drive us all over town

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.416
to our various after-school activities --

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.640
not in the bus.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.640
We had a regular car, too.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.736
She would take me to art classes,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.016
and not just one or two.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.616
She took me to every available art class
from when I was eight to 16,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.280
because that's all I wanted to do.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.400
She even took a class with me
in New York City.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.736
Now, being the youngest of eight,
I learned a few survival skills.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.296
Rule number one:

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.280
don't let your big brother
see you do anything stupid.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.096
So I learned to be quiet and neat

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.760
and careful to follow the rules
and stay in line.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.616
But painting was where I made the rules.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.280
That was my private world.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.440
By 14, I knew I really wanted
to be an artist.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.200
My big plan was to be a waitress
to support my painting.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.296
So I continued honing my skills.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.456
I went to graduate school
and I got an MFA,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.776
and at my first solo show,
my brother asked me,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.776
"What do all these red dots
mean next to the paintings?"

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.800
Nobody was more surprised than me.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.016
The red dots meant
that the paintings were sold

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.136
and that I'd be able to pay my rent

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.480
with painting.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.376
Now, my apartment
had four electrical outlets,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.696
and I couldn't use a microwave
and a toaster at the same time,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.960
but still, I could pay my rent.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.680
So I was very happy.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.120
Here's a painting
from back around that time.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.536
I needed it to be
as realistic as possible.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.960
It had to be specific and believable.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.720
This was the place where I was
isolated and in total control.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.376
Since then, I've made a career
of painting people in water.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.416
Bathtubs and showers were
the perfect enclosed environment.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.176
It was intimate and private,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.416
and water was this complicated challenge
that kept me busy for a decade.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.976
I made about 200 of these paintings,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.720
some of them six to eight feet,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.680
like this one.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.736
For this painting, I mixed flour in
with the bathwater to make it cloudy

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.736
and I floated cooking oil on the surface

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.096
and stuck a girl in it,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.736
and when I lit it up,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.520
it was so beautiful
I couldn't wait to paint it.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.760
I was driven by this
kind of impulsive curiosity,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.496
always looking for something new to add:

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.480
vinyl, steam, glass.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.776
I once put all this Vaseline
in my head and hair

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.640
just to see what that would look like.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.416
Don't do that.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.880
(Laughter)

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.816
So it was going well.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.120
I was finding my way.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.776
I was eager and motivated

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.280
and surrounded by artists,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.800
always going to openings and events.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.216
I was having some success and recognition

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.600
and I moved into an apartment
with more than four outlets.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.136
My mom and I would stay up very late

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.296
talking about our latest ideas
and inspiring each other.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.040
She made beautiful pottery.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.416
I have a friend named Bo
who made this painting

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.816
of his wife and I dancing by the ocean,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.507
and he called it "The Light Years."

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.576
I asked him what that meant, and he said,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.160
"Well, that's when you've stepped
into adulthood, you're no longer a child,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.320
but you're not yet weighed down
by the responsibilities of life."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.720
That was it. It was the light years.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.536
On October 8, 2011,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.616
the light years came to an end.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.520
My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.610
It had spread to her bones,
and it was in her brain.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.935
When she told me this, I fell to my knees.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.200
I totally lost it.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.136
And when I got myself together
and I looked at her,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.736
I realized, this isn't about me.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.800
This is about figuring out
how to help her.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.416
My father is a doctor,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.016
and so we had a great advantage
having him in charge,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.200
and he did a beautiful job
taking care of her.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.496
But I, too, wanted to do
everything I could to help,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.096
so I wanted to try everything.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.320
We all did.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.656
I researched alternative medicines,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.760
diets, juicing, acupuncture.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.976
Finally, I asked her,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.600
"Is this what you want me to do?"

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.520
And she said, "No."

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.480
She said, "Pace yourself.
I'm going to need you later."

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.896
She knew what was happening,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.336
and she knew what the doctors

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.856
and the experts
and the internet didn't know:

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.840
how she wanted to go through this.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.840
I just needed to ask her.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.936
I realized that if I tried to fix it,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.160
I would miss it.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.056
So I just started to be with her,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.480
whatever that meant
and whatever situation came up,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.760
just really listen to her.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.360
If before I was resisting,
then now I was surrendering,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.816
giving up trying to control
the uncontrollable

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.400
and just being there in it with her.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.960
Time slowed down,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.360
and the date was irrelevant.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.480
We developed a routine.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.760
Early each morning I would crawl
into bed with her and sleep with her.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.856
My brother would come for breakfast

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.656
and we'd be so glad to hear
his car coming up the driveway.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.440
So I'd help her up and take both her hands

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.120
and help her walk to the kitchen.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.216
She had this huge mug she made

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.040
she loved to drink her coffee out of,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.960
and she loved Irish soda bread
for breakfast.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.976
Afterwards was the shower,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.256
and she loved this part.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.816
She loved the warm water,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.296
so I made this as indulgent as I could,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.520
like a spa.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.096
My sister would help sometimes.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.416
We had warm towels

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.576
and slippers ready immediately

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.560
so she never got cold for a second.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.200
I'd blow-dry her hair.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.056
My brothers would come in the evenings
and bring their kids,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.920
and that was the highlight of her day.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.400
Over time, we started to use a wheelchair,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.776
and she didn't want to eat so much,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.960
and she used the tiniest little teacup
we could find to drink her coffee.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.976
I couldn't support her myself anymore,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.280
so we hired an aide
to help me with the showers.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.056
These simple daily activities

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.840
became our sacred ritual,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.736
and we repeated them day after day

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.960
as the cancer grew.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.696
It was humbling and painful

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.720
and exactly where I wanted to be.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.440
We called this time "the beautiful awful."

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.976
She died on October 26, 2012.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.680
It was a year and three weeks
after her diagnosis.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.960
She was gone.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.496
My brothers, sister, and father and I

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.120
all came together in this
supportive and attentive way.

00:07:35.903 --> 00:07:37.856
It was as though our whole family dynamic

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.936
and all our established roles vanished

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.616
and we were just
all together in this unknown,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.496
feeling the same thing

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.000
and taking care of each other.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.920
I'm so grateful for them.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.776
As someone who spends most
of my time alone in a studio working,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.656
I had no idea that this kind of connection

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.616
could be so important, so healing.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.440
This was the most important thing.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.520
It was what I always wanted.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.920
So after the funeral, it was time
for me to go back to my studio.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.416
So I packed up my car
and I drove back to Brooklyn,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.360
and painting is what I've always done,
so that's what I did.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.680
And here's what happened.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.480
It's like a release of everything
that was unraveling in me.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:38.895
That safe, very, very carefully
rendered safe place

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.856
that I created in all my other paintings,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.135
it was a myth.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.360
It didn't work.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.080
And I was afraid, because
I didn't want to paint anymore.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.576
So I went into the woods.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.216
I thought, I'll try that, going outside.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.056
I got my paints,
and I wasn't a landscape painter,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.696
but I wasn't really
much of any kind of painter at all,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.216
so I had no attachment, no expectation,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.296
which allowed me to be reckless and free.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.376
I actually left one of these wet paintings

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.320
outside overnight

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.176
next to a light in the woods.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.160
By the morning it was lacquered with bugs.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.136
But I didn't care.
It didn't matter. It didn't matter.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.536
I took all these paintings
back to my studio,

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.216
and scraped them, and carved into them,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.736
and poured paint thinner on them,

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.056
put more paint on top, drew on them.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.280
I had no plan,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.130
but I was watching what was happening.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.585
This is the one with all the bugs in it.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.096
I wasn't trying to represent a real space.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.576
It was the chaos and the imperfections
that were fascinating me,

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.280
and something started to happen.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.160
I got curious again.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.520
This is another one from the woods.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.136
There was a caveat now, though.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.096
I couldn't be controlling
the paint like I used to.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.136
It had to be about implying
and suggesting,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.880
not explaining or describing.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.016
And that imperfect,
chaotic, turbulent surface

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.840
is what told the story.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.440
I started to be as curious
as I was when I was a student.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.096
So the next thing was I wanted
to put figures in these paintings, people,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.896
and I loved this new environment,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.200
so I wanted to have
both people and this atmosphere.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.896
When the idea hit me of how to do this,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.696
I got kind of nauseous and dizzy,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.576
which is really just adrenaline, probably,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.536
but for me it's a really good sign.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.696
And so now I want to show you
what I've been working on.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.776
It's something I haven't shown yet,
and it's like a preview, I guess,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.056
of my upcoming show,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.280
what I have so far.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.960
Expansive space

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.080
instead of the isolated bathtub.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.640
I'm going outside instead of inside.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.680
Loosening control,

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.896
savoring the imperfections,

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.120
allowing the --

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.840
allowing the imperfections.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.336
And in that imperfection,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.256
you can find a vulnerability.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.440
I could feel my deepest intention,
what matters most to me,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.200
that human connection

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.320
that can happen in a space
where there's no resisting or controlling.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.275
I want to make paintings about that.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.560
So here's what I learned.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.240
We're all going to have
big losses in our lives,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.056
maybe a job or a career,

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.360
relationships, love, our youth.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.736
We're going to lose our health,

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.960
people we love.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.656
These kinds of losses
are out of our control.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.880
They're unpredictable,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.320
and they bring us to our knees.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.520
And so I say, let them.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.400
Fall to your knees. Be humbled.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.640
Let go of trying to change it

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.960
or even wanting it to be different.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.800
It just is.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.616
And then there's space,

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.816
and in that space feel your vulnerability,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.536
what matters most to you,

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.240
your deepest intention.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.320
And be curious to connect

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.720
to what and who is really here,

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.240
awake and alive.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.480
It's what we all want.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.920
Let's take the opportunity
to find something beautiful

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.680
in the unknown, in the unpredictable,

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.080
and even in the awful.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.536
Thank you.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.639
(Applause)
