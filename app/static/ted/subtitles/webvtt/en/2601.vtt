00:00:00.825 --> 00:00:03.176
Have you ever noticed
when you ask someone to talk

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.536
about a change they're making
for the better in their personal lives,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.520
they're often really energetic?

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:11.496
Whether it's training for a marathon,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.776
picking up an old hobby,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.656
or learning a new skill,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.936
for most people,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.200
self-transformation projects
occupy a very positive emotional space.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.176
Self-transformation is empowering,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.536
energizing, even exhilarating.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.336
I mean just take a look
at some of the titles of self-help books:

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.056
"Awaken the Giant Within,"

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.576
"Practicing the Power of Now,"

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.056
or here's a great one
we can all relate to,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.296
"You are a Badass:

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.416
How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness
and Start Living an Awesome Life."

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.640
(Laughter)

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.560
When it comes to self-transformation,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.800
you can't help but get
a sense of the excitement.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.016
But there's another type of transformation

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.120
that occupies a very different
emotional space.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.680
The transformation of organizations.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.216
If you're like most people,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.616
when you hear the words "Our organization
is going to start a transformation,"

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.040
you're thinking, "Uh-oh."

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:16.576
(Laughter)

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.800
"Layoffs."

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.736
The blood drains from your face,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.616
your mind goes into overdrive,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.880
frantically searching
for some place to run and hide.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.616
Well, you can run,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.920
but you really can't hide.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.016
Most of us spend
the majority of our waking hours

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.560
involved in organizations.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.136
And due to changes in globalization,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.696
changes due to advances in technology

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.536
and other factors,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.480
the reality is our organizations
are constantly having to adapt.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.576
In fact,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.480
I call this the era
of "always-on" transformation.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.656
When I shared this idea
with my wife Nicola,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.816
she said, "Always-on transformation?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.920
That sounds exhausting."

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.936
And that may be
exactly what you're thinking --

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.536
and you would be right.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.696
Particularly if we continue to approach
the transformation of organizations

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.080
the way we always have been.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.336
But because we can't hide,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.056
we need to sort out two things.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.296
First,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.056
why is transformation so exhausting?

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.840
And second, how do we fix it?

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.416
First of all,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.576
let's acknowledge that change is hard.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.616
People naturally resist change,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.280
especially when it's imposed on them.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.776
But there are things that organizations do
that make change even harder

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.640
and more exhausting
for people than it needs to be.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.936
First of all,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.400
leaders often wait too long to act.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.256
As a result,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.720
everything is happening in crisis mode.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.338
Which, of course, tends to be exhausting.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.456
Or, given the urgency,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.400
what they'll do is they'll just focus
on the short-term results,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.480
but that doesn't give
any hope for the future.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.280
Or they'll just take
a superficial, one-off approach,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.136
hoping that they can return
back to business as usual

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.760
as soon as the crisis is over.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.816
This kind of approach

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.920
is kind of the way some students
approach preparing for standardized tests.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.736
In order to get test scores to go up,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.360
teachers will end up teaching to the test.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.536
Now, that approach can work;

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.496
test results often do go up.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.296
But it fails the fundamental
goal of education:

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.440
to prepare students
to succeed over the long term.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.200
So given these obstacles,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.976
what can we do

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.456
to transform the way
we transform organizations

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.440
so rather than being exhausting,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.040
it's actually empowering and energizing?

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.176
To do that, we need to focus
on five strategic imperatives,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.935
all of which have one thing in common:

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.240
putting people first.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.736
The first imperative
for putting people first

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.520
is to inspire through purpose.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.816
Most transformations have
financial and operational goals.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.096
These are important
and they can be energizing to leaders,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.680
but they tend not to be very motivating
to most people in the organization.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.256
To motivate more broadly,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.680
the transformation needs to connect
with a deeper sense of purpose.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.920
Take LEGO.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.880
The LEGO Group has become
an extraordinary global company.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.256
Under their very capable leadership,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.120
they've actually undergone
a series of transformations.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.016
While each of these
has had a very specific focus,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.336
the North Star,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.176
linking and guiding all of them,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.640
has been Lego's powerful purpose:

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.240
inspire and develop
the builders of tomorrow.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.560
Expanding globally?

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.576
It's not about increasing sales,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.240
but about giving millions of additional
children access to LEGO building bricks.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.360
Investment and innovation?

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.818
It's not about developing new products,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.656
but about enabling more children

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.200
to experience the joy
of learning through play.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.976
Not surprisingly,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.080
that deep sense of purpose tends
to be highly motivating to LEGO's people.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.056
The second imperative
for putting people first

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.800
is to go all in.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.776
Too many transformations

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.536
are nothing more than
head-count cutting exercises;

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.040
layoffs under the guise of transformation.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.016
In the face of relentless competition,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.976
it may well be that you will
have to take the painful decision

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.856
to downsize the organization,

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.560
just as you may have to lose some weight
in order to run a marathon.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.216
But losing weight alone

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.080
will not get you across
the finish line with a winning time.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.760
To win

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.640
you need to go all in.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.920
You need to go all in.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.000
Rather than just cutting costs,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.176
you need to think about initiatives

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.896
that will enable you
to win in the medium term,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.896
initiatives to drive growth,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.976
actions that will fundamentally
change the way the company operates,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.536
and very importantly,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.200
investments to develop
the leadership and the talent.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.456
The third imperative
for putting people first

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.176
is to enable people with the capabilities

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.040
that they need to succeed
during the transformation and beyond.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.520
Over the years I've competed
in a number of triathlons.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.456
You know, frankly, I'm not that good,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.496
but I do have one distinct capability;

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.200
I am remarkably fast at finding my bike.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.536
(Laughter)

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.376
By the time I finish the swim,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.256
almost all the bikes are already gone.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.760
(Laughter)

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.216
Real triathletes know that each leg --

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.976
the swim, the bike, the run --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.496
really requires different capabilities,

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.736
different tools,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.416
different skills, different techniques.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.896
Likewise when we transform organizations,

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.776
we need to be sure
that we're giving our people

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.600
the skills and the tools
they need along the way.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.376
Chronos,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.376
a global software company,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.336
recognized the need
to transfer from building products --

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.016
software products --

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.800
to building software as a service.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.016
To enable its people
to take that transformation,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.736
first of all they invested in new tools

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.816
that would enable their employees
to monitor the usage of the features

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.600
as well as customer satisfaction
with the new service.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.976
They also invested in skill development,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.816
so that their employees would be able

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.320
to resolve customer service
problems on the spot.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.176
And very importantly,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.576
they also reinforced the collaborative
behaviors that would be required

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.640
to deliver an end-to-end
seamless customer experience.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.256
Because of these investments,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.616
rather than feeling overwhelmed
by the transformation,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.895
Chronos employees actually felt energized

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.000
and empowered in their new roles.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.416
In the era of "always-on" transformation,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.936
change is a constant.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.896
My fourth imperative therefore

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.720
is to instill a culture
of continuous learning.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.816
When Satya Nadella
became the CEO of Microsoft

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.776
in February 2014,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.696
he embarked on an ambitious
transformation journey

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.920
to prepare the company to compete
in a mobile-first, cloud-first world.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.936
This included changes to strategy,

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.176
the organization

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.880
and very importantly, the culture.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.600
Microsoft's culture at the time was one
of silos and internal competition --

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.520
not exactly conducive to learning.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.320
Nadella took this head-on.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.976
He rallied his leadership
around his vision

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.520
for a living, learning culture,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.576
shifting from a fixed mindset,

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.976
where your role was to show up
as the smartest person in the room,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.816
to a growth mindset,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.320
where your role was to listen, to learn
and to bring out the best in people.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.976
Well, early days,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.120
Microsoft employees already
noticed this shift in the culture --

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.480
clear evidence of Microsoft
putting people first.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.120
My fifth and final imperative
is specifically for leaders.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.856
In a transformation,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.440
a leader needs to have a vision,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.800
a clear road map with milestones,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.056
and then you need to hold people
accountable for results.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.033
In other words, you need to be directive.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.376
But in order to capture
the hearts and minds of people,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.800
you also need to be inclusive.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.440
Inclusive leadership
is critical to putting people first.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.720
I live in the San Francisco Bay area.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.896
And right now,

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.400
our basketball team
is the best in the league.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.616
We won the 2015 championship,

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.880
and we're favored to win again this year.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.656
There are many explanations for this.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.400
They have some fabulous players,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.896
but one of the key reasons

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:52.360
is their head coach, Steve Kerr,
is an inclusive leader.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.976
When Kerr came to the Warriors in 2014,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.680
the Warriors were looking
for a major transformation.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.960
They hadn't won a national
championship since 1975.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.816
Kerr came in, and he had a clear vision,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.240
and he immediately got to work.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.816
From the outset,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.936
he reached out and engaged
the players and the staff.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.240
He created an environment of open debate
and solicited suggestions.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.056
During games he would often ask,

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.960
"What are you seeing that I'm missing?"

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.760
One the best examples of this
came in game four of the 2015 finals.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.720
The Warriors were down two games to one

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.040
when Kerr made the decision
to change the starting lineup;

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.000
a bold move by any measure.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.280
The Warriors won the game
and went on to win the championship.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.216
And it is widely viewed

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.920
that that move was
the pivotal move in their victory.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.120
Interestingly, it wasn't
actually Kerr's idea.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.160
It was the idea of his 28-year-old
assistant, Nick U'Ren.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.336
Because of Kerr's leadership style,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.200
U'Ren felt comfortable
bringing the idea forward.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.216
And Kerr not only listened,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.800
but he implemented the idea

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.176
and then afterwards,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.160
gave U'Ren all the credit --

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:28.040
actions all consistent with Kerr's
highly inclusive approach to leadership.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.936
In the era of "always-on" transformation,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.640
organizations are always
going to be transforming.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.440
But doing so does not
have to be exhausting.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.256
We owe it to ourselves,

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.256
to our organizations

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.000
and to society more broadly

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.840
to boldly transform
our approach to transformation.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.576
To do that,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.080
we need to start putting people first.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.016
Thank you.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:07.992
(Applause)
