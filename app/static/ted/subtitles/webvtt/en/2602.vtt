WEBVTT

00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:12.503
(Music)

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:38.077
(Applause)

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.433
Trevor Copp: When "Dancing With the Stars"
first hit the airwaves,

00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:49.536
that is not what it looked like.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.097
(Laughter)

00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:54.148
Jeff and I were full-time
ballroom dance instructors

00:01:54.172 --> 00:01:57.585
when the big TV ballroom revival hit,

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.800
and this was incredible.

00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:03.736
I mean, one day we would say "foxtrot,"

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.797
and people were like "Foxes trotting."

00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:08.551
(Laughter)

00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:10.529
And the next day they were telling us

00:02:10.553 --> 00:02:12.941
the finer points of a good feather step.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.318
And this blew our minds.

00:02:15.342 --> 00:02:20.564
I mean, all of the ballroom dance
geeking out that we had always done

00:02:20.588 --> 00:02:24.227
on why salsa worked differently
than the competitive rumba

00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:26.755
and why tango traveled unlike the waltz,

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.796
all of that just hit
the public consciousness,

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:32.899
and it changed everything.

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:36.200
But running parallel to this excitement,

00:02:36.224 --> 00:02:40.575
the excitement that suddenly,
somehow, we were cool --

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.020
(Laughter)

00:02:43.044 --> 00:02:45.057
there was also this reservation.

00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:48.371
Why this and why now?

00:02:49.556 --> 00:02:52.789
Jeff Fox: When Trevor and I
would get together for training seminars

00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:53.972
or just for fun,

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:55.862
we'd toss each other around, mix it up,

00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:58.073
take a break from having
to lead all the time.

00:02:58.097 --> 00:03:00.867
We even came up with a system
for switching lead and follow

00:03:00.891 --> 00:03:02.042
while we were dancing,

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:04.075
as a way of taking turns and playing fair.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.056
It wasn't until we used that system
as part of a performance

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.241
in a small festival

00:03:08.265 --> 00:03:10.392
that we got an important tap
on the shoulder.

00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:13.724
Lisa O'Connell, a dramaturge
and director of a playwright center,

00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:15.746
pulled us aside after the show and said,

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.834
"Do you have any idea
how political that was?"

00:03:18.858 --> 00:03:20.874
(Laughter)

00:03:20.898 --> 00:03:23.667
So that began an eight-year
collaboration to create a play

00:03:23.691 --> 00:03:26.452
which not only further developed
our system for switching

00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:30.234
but also explored the impact
of being locked into a single role,

00:03:30.258 --> 00:03:31.422
and what's worse,

00:03:31.446 --> 00:03:33.575
being defined by that single role.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.492
TC: Because, of course,

00:03:35.968 --> 00:03:40.177
classic Latin and ballroom dancing
isn't just a system of dancing;

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.344
it's a way of thinking, of being,

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:45.547
of relating to each other

00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:48.162
that captured a whole period's values.

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.966
There's one thing that stayed
consistent, though:

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.316
the man leads

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.735
and the woman follows.

00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:56.854
So street salsa, championship tango,
it's all the same --

00:03:56.878 --> 00:03:58.736
he leads, she follows.

00:03:59.335 --> 00:04:01.074
So this was gender training.

00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:03.425
You weren't just learning to dance --

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.489
you were learning to "man" and to "woman."

00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:09.003
It's a relic.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.896
And in the way of relics,
you don't throw it out,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.303
but you need to know
that this is the past.

00:04:14.327 --> 00:04:15.707
This isn't the present.

00:04:16.866 --> 00:04:19.945
It's like Shakespeare:
respect it, revive it -- great!

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:21.455
But know that this is history.

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.021
This doesn't represent how we think today.

00:04:25.045 --> 00:04:26.585
So we asked ourselves:

00:04:26.609 --> 00:04:28.263
If you strip it all down,

00:04:28.672 --> 00:04:31.431
what is at the core of partner dancing?

00:04:32.094 --> 00:04:34.329
JF: Well, the core principle
of partner dancing

00:04:34.353 --> 00:04:36.753
is that one person leads,
the other one follows.

00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:40.364
The machine works the same,
regardless of who's playing which role.

00:04:40.388 --> 00:04:43.659
The physics of movement doesn't really
give a crap about your gender.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:44.723
(Laughter)

00:04:44.747 --> 00:04:46.777
So if we were to update the existing form,

00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:48.895
we would need to make it
more representative

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.189
of how we interact here, now, in 2015.

00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:54.963
When you watch ballroom,
don't just watch what's there.

00:04:55.517 --> 00:04:56.699
Watch what's not.

00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:00.101
The couple is always
only a man and a woman.

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:01.283
Together.

00:05:01.307 --> 00:05:02.579
Only.

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:03.754
Ever.

00:05:03.778 --> 00:05:07.860
So, same-sex and gender nonconformist
couples just disappear.

00:05:07.884 --> 00:05:10.516
In most mainstream international
ballroom competitions,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.159
same-sex couples are rarely
recognized on the floor,

00:05:13.183 --> 00:05:14.367
and in many cases,

00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:16.128
the rules prohibit them completely.

00:05:16.152 --> 00:05:20.987
TC: Try this: Google-image,
"professional Latin dancer,"

00:05:21.504 --> 00:05:23.715
and then look for an actual Latino person.

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:25.106
(Laughter)

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.669
You'll be there for days.

00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:31.170
What you will get is page after page
of white, straight Russian couples

00:05:31.194 --> 00:05:33.159
spray-tanned to the point of mahogany.

00:05:33.183 --> 00:05:35.084
(Laughter)

00:05:35.108 --> 00:05:37.368
There are no black people,
there are no Asians,

00:05:37.392 --> 00:05:38.676
no mixed-race couples,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.228
so basically, non-white people
just disappeared.

00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:46.739
Even within the white-straight-
couple-only paradigm --

00:05:48.008 --> 00:05:49.389
she can't be taller,

00:05:49.413 --> 00:05:50.881
he can't be shorter.

00:05:50.905 --> 00:05:52.528
She can't be bolder,

00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:54.420
he can't be gentler.

00:05:55.261 --> 00:05:57.481
If you were to take a ballroom dance

00:05:57.505 --> 00:05:59.798
and translate that into a conversation

00:05:59.822 --> 00:06:01.264
and drop that into a movie,

00:06:01.288 --> 00:06:04.910
we, as a culture,
would never stand for this.

00:06:04.934 --> 00:06:07.857
He dictates, she reacts.

00:06:08.674 --> 00:06:11.679
No relationship -- gay,
straight or anything --

00:06:11.703 --> 00:06:16.110
that we would regard as remotely healthy
or functional looks like that,

00:06:16.134 --> 00:06:17.720
and yet somehow,

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:20.358
you put it on prime time,
you slap some makeup on it,

00:06:20.382 --> 00:06:24.039
throw the glitter on, put it out there
as movement, not as text,

00:06:24.832 --> 00:06:26.950
and we, as a culture,

00:06:26.974 --> 00:06:28.297
tune in and clap.

00:06:29.805 --> 00:06:32.751
We are applauding our own absence.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.948
Too many people have disappeared
from partner dancing.

00:06:38.334 --> 00:06:42.592
(Music)

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:26.915
(Applause)

00:07:28.957 --> 00:07:31.496
JF: Now, you just saw
two men dancing together.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.533
(Laughter)

00:07:32.557 --> 00:07:34.022
And you thought it looked ...

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:35.694
a little strange.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.175
Interesting -- appealing, even --

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:39.752
but a little bit odd.

00:07:40.372 --> 00:07:43.356
Even avid followers of the same-sex
ballroom circuit can attest

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.490
that while same-sex partner dancing
can be dynamic and strong and exciting,

00:07:47.514 --> 00:07:49.837
it just doesn't quite seem to fit.

00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:51.663
Aesthetically speaking,

00:07:51.687 --> 00:07:55.733
if Alida and I take the classic
closed ballroom hold ...

00:07:57.637 --> 00:07:59.194
this is considered beautiful.

00:08:02.204 --> 00:08:04.392
(Laughter)

00:08:04.703 --> 00:08:05.961
But why not this?

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.675
(Laughter)

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:11.367
See, the standard image that the leader
must be larger and masculine

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:13.485
and the follower smaller and feminine --

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.429
this is a stumbling point.

00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:19.848
TC: So we wanted to look at this
from a totally different angle.

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:25.035
So, what if we could keep
the idea of lead and follow

00:08:25.059 --> 00:08:28.255
but toss the idea that this
was connected to gender?

00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:33.827
Further, what if a couple
could lead and follow each other

00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:35.080
and then switch?

00:08:35.513 --> 00:08:36.746
And then switch back?

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.139
What if it could be like a conversation,

00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:44.018
taking turns listening and speaking,
just like we do in life?

00:08:44.042 --> 00:08:47.254
What if we could dance like that?

00:08:48.418 --> 00:08:51.059
We call it "Liquid Lead Dancing."

00:08:52.542 --> 00:08:54.461
JF: Let's try this with a Latin dance,

00:08:55.045 --> 00:08:56.199
salsa.

00:08:56.524 --> 00:09:00.161
In salsa, there's a key transitional step,
called the cross-body lead.

00:09:00.185 --> 00:09:02.945
We use it as punctuation
to break up the improvisation.

00:09:02.969 --> 00:09:06.339
It can be a little tricky to spot
if you're not used to looking for it,

00:09:06.363 --> 00:09:07.514
so here it is.

00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:14.845
One more time for the cheap seats.

00:09:14.869 --> 00:09:17.305
(Laughter)

00:09:20.378 --> 00:09:22.383
And here's the action one more time,

00:09:22.407 --> 00:09:23.766
nice and slow.

00:09:28.842 --> 00:09:32.929
Now, if we apply liquid-lead thinking
to this transitional step,

00:09:32.953 --> 00:09:34.635
the cross-body lead becomes a point

00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:36.644
where the lead and the follow can switch.

00:09:36.668 --> 00:09:39.191
The person following can elect
to take over the lead,

00:09:39.215 --> 00:09:41.568
or the person leading can choose
to surrender it,

00:09:41.592 --> 00:09:44.184
essentially making it
a counter-cross-body lead.

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:46.144
Here's how that looks in slow motion.

00:09:53.913 --> 00:09:57.300
And here's how it looked
when we danced it in the opening dance.

00:10:02.789 --> 00:10:06.162
With this simple tweak,
the dance moves from being a dictation

00:10:06.186 --> 00:10:07.375
to a negotiation.

00:10:07.761 --> 00:10:10.254
Anyone can lead. Anyone can follow.

00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:12.761
And more importantly,
you can change your mind.

00:10:13.523 --> 00:10:15.889
Now, this is only one example
of how this applies,

00:10:15.913 --> 00:10:18.552
but once the blinkers come off,
anything can happen.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:24.273
TC: Let's look at how Liquid Lead thinking
could apply to a classic waltz.

00:10:24.297 --> 00:10:25.525
Because, of course,

00:10:25.549 --> 00:10:28.140
it isn't just a system of switching leads;

00:10:28.164 --> 00:10:29.330
it's a way of thinking

00:10:29.354 --> 00:10:32.610
that can actually make
the dance itself more efficient.

00:10:32.981 --> 00:10:34.329
So: the waltz.

00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:36.563
The waltz is a turning dance.

00:10:36.984 --> 00:10:38.596
This means that for the lead,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.832
you spend half of the dance
traveling backwards,

00:10:41.856 --> 00:10:43.326
completely blind.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.899
And because of the follower's position,

00:10:45.923 --> 00:10:48.731
basically, no one can see
where they're going.

00:10:48.755 --> 00:10:50.103
(Laughter)

00:10:50.127 --> 00:10:52.139
So you're out here on the floor,

00:10:52.163 --> 00:10:54.827
and then imagine that coming right at you.

00:10:54.851 --> 00:10:56.200
JF: Raaaaaah!

00:10:56.224 --> 00:10:57.748
(Laughter)

00:10:57.772 --> 00:11:01.068
TC: There are actually a lot
of accidents out there

00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:03.334
that happen as a result
of this blind spot.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.322
But what if the partners
were to just allow for

00:11:07.346 --> 00:11:09.495
a switch of posture for a moment?

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:11.798
A lot of accidents could be avoided.

00:11:12.253 --> 00:11:17.093
Even if one person led the whole dance
but allowed this switch to happen,

00:11:17.117 --> 00:11:18.503
it would be a lot safer,

00:11:18.527 --> 00:11:21.571
while at the same time,
offering new aesthetics into the waltz.

00:11:22.221 --> 00:11:25.654
Because physics doesn't give a damn
about your gender.

00:11:25.678 --> 00:11:26.737
(Laughter)

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:31.155
JF: Now, we've danced Liquid Lead
in clubs, convention centers

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:34.007
and as part of "First Dance,"
the play we created with Lisa,

00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:36.363
on stages in North America and in Europe.

00:11:36.387 --> 00:11:38.070
And it never fails to engage.

00:11:38.736 --> 00:11:42.217
I mean, beyond the unusual sight
of seeing two men dancing together,

00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:44.735
it always evokes and engages.

00:11:45.174 --> 00:11:46.461
But why?

00:11:46.485 --> 00:11:49.580
The secret lies in what made
Lisa see our initial demonstration

00:11:49.604 --> 00:11:50.907
as "political."

00:11:50.931 --> 00:11:53.506
It wasn't just that we were
switching lead and follow;

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.587
it's that we stayed consistent
in our presence, our personality

00:11:56.611 --> 00:11:59.540
and our power, regardless
of which role we were playing.

00:11:59.564 --> 00:12:01.184
We were still us.

00:12:01.816 --> 00:12:03.851
And that's where the true freedom lies --

00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:05.864
not just the freedom to switch roles,

00:12:05.888 --> 00:12:09.503
but the freedom from being defined
by whichever role you're playing,

00:12:09.527 --> 00:12:12.083
the freedom to always remain
true to yourself.

00:12:12.457 --> 00:12:15.557
Forget what a lead is supposed
to look like, or a follow.

00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:17.136
Be a masculine follow

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.383
or a feminine lead.

00:12:18.795 --> 00:12:20.065
Just be yourself.

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:23.590
Obviously, this applies
off the dance floor as well,

00:12:23.614 --> 00:12:26.153
but on the floor, it gives us
the perfect opportunity

00:12:26.177 --> 00:12:29.474
to update an old paradigm,
reinvigorate an old relic,

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:33.687
and make it more representative
of our era and our current way of being.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.971
TC: Jeff and I dance partner dancing
all the time with women and men

00:12:37.995 --> 00:12:39.383
and we love it.

00:12:39.407 --> 00:12:43.970
But we dance with a consciousness
that this is a historic form

00:12:43.994 --> 00:12:48.304
that can produce silence
and produce invisibility

00:12:48.328 --> 00:12:51.022
across the spectrum of identity
that we enjoy today.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.314
We invented Liquid Lead

00:12:53.338 --> 00:12:58.503
as a way of stripping out
all the ideas that don't belong to us

00:12:58.527 --> 00:13:02.822
and taking partner dancing back
to what it really always was:

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.756
the fine art of taking care of each other.

00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:15.413
(Music)

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:20.903
(Applause)
