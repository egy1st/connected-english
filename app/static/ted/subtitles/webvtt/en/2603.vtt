WEBVTT

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.256
You are a high-ranking
military service member

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.240
deployed to Afghanistan.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.376
You are responsible for the lives

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.536
of hundreds of men and women,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.720
and your base is under attack.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.360
Incoming mortar rounds
are exploding all around you.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.376
Struggling to see
through the dust and the smoke,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.016
you do your best to assist the wounded

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.240
and then crawl to a nearby bunker.

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.016
Conscious but dazed by the blasts,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.200
you lay on your side and attempt
to process what has just happened.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.136
As you regain your vision,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.416
you see a bloody face

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.760
staring back at you.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.680
The image is terrifying,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.856
but you quickly come to understand

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.760
it's not real.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.336
This vision continues to visit you
multiple times a day and in your sleep.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.696
You choose not to tell anyone
for fear of losing your job

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.400
or being seen as weak.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.976
You give the vision a name,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.096
Bloody Face in Bunker,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.440
and call it BFIB for short.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.016
You keep BFIB locked away in your mind,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.816
secretly haunting you,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.160
for the next seven years.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.280
Now close your eyes.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.520
Can you see BFIB?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.376
If you can, you're beginning
to see the face

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.816
of the invisible wounds of war,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.696
commonly known
as post-traumatic stress disorder

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.160
and traumatic brain injury.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.016
While I can't say I have
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.960
I've never been a stranger to it.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.800
When I was a little girl, I would visit
my grandparents every summer.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.976
It was my grandfather

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.400
who introduced me to the effects
of combat on the psyche.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.336
While my grandfather was serving
as a Marine in the Korean War,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.240
a bullet pierced his neck
and rendered him unable to cry out.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.895
He watched as a corpsman passed him over,

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.456
declaring him a goner,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.120
and then leaving him to die.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.576
Years later, after his
physical wounds had healed

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.216
and he'd returned home,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.800
he rarely spoke of his
experiences in waking life.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.536
But at night I would hear him
shouting obscenities

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.080
from his room down the hall.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.656
And during the day I would announce myself
as I entered the room,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.480
careful not to startle or agitate him.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.416
He lived out the remainder of his days

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.536
isolated and tight-lipped,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.336
never finding a way to express himself,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.120
and I didn't yet
have the tools to guide him.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.096
I wouldn't have a name
for my grandfather's condition

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.880
until I was in my 20s.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.936
Seeking a graduate degree in art therapy,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.200
I naturally gravitated
towards the study of trauma.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.936
And while sitting in class learning
about post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.560
or PTSD for short,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.016
my mission to help service members
who suffered like my grandfather

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.480
began to take form.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.816
We've had various names
for post-traumatic stress

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.440
throughout the history of war:

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.840
homesickness,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.680
soldier's heart,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.800
shell shock,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.720
thousand-yard stare, for instance.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.416
And while I was pursuing my degree,
a new war was raging,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.656
and thanks to modern body armor
and military vehicles,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.440
service members were surviving
blast injuries they wouldn't have before.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.616
But the invisible wounds
were reaching new levels,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.896
and this pushed military doctors
and researchers

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.216
to try and truly understand the effects
that traumatic brain injury, or TBI,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.880
and PTSD have on the brain.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.136
Due to advances
in technology and neuroimaging,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.296
we now know there's
an actual shutdown in the Broca's,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.080
or the speech-language area of the brain,
after an individual experiences trauma.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.216
This physiological change,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.336
or speechless terror as it's often called,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.656
coupled with mental health stigma,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.416
the fear of being judged

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.896
or misunderstood,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.576
possibly even removed
from their current duties,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.600
has led to the invisible struggles
of our servicemen and women.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.416
Generation after generation of veterans

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.696
have chosen not to talk
about their experiences,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.640
and suffer in solitude.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.896
I had my work cut out for me
when I got my first job

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.576
as an art therapist at the nation's
largest military medical center,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.800
Walter Reed.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.376
After working for a few years
on a locked-in patient psychiatric unit,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.296
I eventually transferred to the National
Intrepid Center of Excellence, NICoE,

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.680
which leads TBI care
for active duty service members.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.936
Now, I believed in art therapy,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.976
but I was going to have
to convince service members,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.736
big, tough, strong, manly military men,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.496
and some women too,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.520
to give art-making as
a psychotherapeutic intervention a try.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.520
The results have been
nothing short of spectacular.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.376
Vivid, symbolic artwork

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.376
is being created
by our servicemen and women,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.920
and every work of art tells a story.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.136
We've observed that the process
of art therapy bypasses

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.120
the speech-language issue with the brain.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.360
Art-making accesses the same sensory
areas of the brain that encode trauma.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.936
Service members can use the art-making
to work through their experiences

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.440
in a nonthreatening way.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.176
They can then apply words
to their physical creations,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.600
reintegrating the left
and the right hemispheres of the brain.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.520
Now, we've seen this can work
with all forms of art --

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.600
drawing, painting, collage --

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.040
but what seems to have the most impact

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.920
is mask-making.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.680
Finally, these invisible wounds
don't just have a name,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.200
they have a face.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.456
And when service members
create these masks,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.760
it allows them to come to grips,
literally, with their trauma.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.976
And it's amazing
how often that enables them

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.200
to break through the trauma
and start to heal.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.080
Remember BFIB?

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.336
That was a real experience
for one of my patients,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.816
and when he created his mask,

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.720
he was able to let go
of that haunting image.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.936
Initially, it was a daunting process
for the service member,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.936
but eventually he began
to think of BFIB as the mask,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.616
not his internal wound,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.496
and he would go to leave each session,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.560
he would hand me the mask,
and say, "Melissa, take care of him."

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.736
Eventually, we placed BFIB in a box
to further contain him,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.216
and when the service member
went to leave the NICoE,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.280
he chose to leave BFIB behind.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.896
A year later, he had only seen BFIB twice,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.616
and both times BFIB was smiling

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.800
and the service member
didn't feel anxious.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.336
Now, whenever that service member
is haunted by some traumatic memory,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.800
he continues to paint.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.616
Every time he paints
these disturbing images,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.360
he sees them less or not at all.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.696
Philosophers have told us
for thousands of years

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.976
that the power to create

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.760
is very closely linked
to the power to destroy.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.176
Now science is showing us
that the part of the brain

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.216
that registers a traumatic wound

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.120
can be the part of the brain
where healing happens too.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.880
And art therapy is showing us
how to make that connection.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.216
We asked one of our service members

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.576
to describe how mask-making
impacted his treatment,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.200
and this is what he had to say.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.816
(Video) Service Member:
You sort of just zone out into the mask.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.296
You zone out into the drawing,

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.320
and for me, it just released the block,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.576
so I was able to do it.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.216
And then when I looked at it
after two days, I was like,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.576
"Holy crap, here's the picture,
here's the key, here's the puzzle,"

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.656
and then from there it just soared.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.136
I mean, from there
my treatment just when out of sight,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.856
because they were like,
Kurt, explain this, explain this.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.696
And for the first time in 23 years,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.616
I could actually talk about stuff
openly to, like, anybody.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.736
I could talk to you about it
right now if I wanted to,

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.416
because it unlocked it.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.696
It's just amazing.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.400
And it allowed me to put 23 years of PTSD

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:46.256
and TBI stuff together in one place

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.400
that has never happened before.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.240
Sorry.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.896
Melissa Walker: Over the past five years,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.736
we've had over 1,000 masks made.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.189
It's pretty amazing, isn't it?

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.856
Thank you.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.400
(Applause)

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.560
I wish I could have shared
this process with my grandfather,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.840
but I know that he would be thrilled

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.696
that we are finding ways

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.840
to help today's and tomorrow's
service members heal,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.760
and finding the resources within them

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.336
that they can call upon

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.360
to heal themselves.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.896
Thank you.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:35.274
(Applause)
