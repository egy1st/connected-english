00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.320
Let's talk about trust.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.736
We all know trust is fundamental,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.376
but when it comes to trusting people,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.160
something profound is happening.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.056
Please raise your hand

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.400
if you have ever been
a host or a guest on Airbnb.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.616
Wow. That's a lot of you.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.080
Who owns Bitcoin?

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.896
Still a lot of you. OK.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.616
And please raise your hand
if you've ever used Tinder

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.256
to help you find a mate.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.096
(Laughter)

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.496
This one's really hard to count
because you're kind of going like this.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.336
(Laughter)

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.136
These are all examples of how technology

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.256
is creating new mechanisms

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.296
that are enabling us to trust
unknown people, companies and ideas.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.336
And yet at the same time,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.896
trust in institutions --

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.856
banks, governments and even churches --

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.256
is collapsing.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.496
So what's happening here,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.280
and who do you trust?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.696
Let's start in France with a platform --
with a company, I should say --

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.856
with a rather funny-sounding name,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.136
BlaBlaCar.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.776
It's a platform that matches
drivers and passengers

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.816
who want to share
long-distance journeys together.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.056
The average ride taken is 320 kilometers.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.680
So it's a good idea
to choose your fellow travelers wisely.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.296
Social profiles and reviews
help people make a choice.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.336
You can see if someone's a smoker,
you can see what kind of music they like,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.960
you can see if they're going to bring
their dog along for the ride.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.016
But it turns out
that the key social identifier

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.656
is how much you're going
to talk in the car.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.496
(Laughter)

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.136
Bla, not a lot,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.456
bla bla, you want a nice bit of chitchat,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.216
and bla bla bla, you're not going
to stop talking the entire way

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.696
from London to Paris.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.016
(Laughter)

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.056
It's remarkable, right,
that this idea works at all,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.936
because it's counter to the lesson
most of us were taught as a child:

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.280
never get in a car with a stranger.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.816
And yet, BlaBlaCar transports
more than four million people

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.080
every single month.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.216
To put that in context,
that's more passengers

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.720
than the Eurostar
or JetBlue airlines carry.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.496
BlaBlaCar is a beautiful illustration
of how technology is enabling

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.120
millions of people across the world
to take a trust leap.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.816
A trust leap happens when we take the risk
to do something new or different

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.880
to the way that we've always done it.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.000
Let's try to visualize this together.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.520
OK. I want you to close your eyes.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.376
There is a man staring at me
with his eyes wide open.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.856
I'm on this big red circle. I can see.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.296
So close your eyes.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.176
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.456
I'll do it with you.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.496
And I want you to imagine
there exists a gap

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.080
between you and something unknown.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.616
That unknown can be
someone you've just met.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.736
It can be a place you've never been to.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.136
It can be something
you've never tried before.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.376
You got it?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.496
OK. You can open your eyes now.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.856
For you to leap from a place of certainty,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.456
to take a chance on that someone
or something unknown,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.816
you need a force to pull you over the gap,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.680
and that remarkable force is trust.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.176
Trust is an elusive concept,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.576
and yet we depend on it
for our lives to function.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.856
I trust my children

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.736
when they say they're going
to turn the lights out at night.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.976
I trusted the pilot
who flew me here to keep me safe.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.816
It's a word we use a lot,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.256
without always thinking
about what it really means

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.656
and how it works in different
contexts of our lives.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.296
There are, in fact,
hundreds of definitions of trust,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.896
and most can be reduced
to some kind of risk assessment

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.680
of how likely it is
that things will go right.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.696
But I don't like this definition of trust,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.016
because it makes trust
sound rational and predictable,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.616
and it doesn't really get
to the human essence

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.576
of what it enables us to do

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.576
and how it empowers us

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.696
to connect with other people.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.776
So I define trust a little differently.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.240
I define trust as a confident
relationship to the unknown.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.016
Now, when you view trust
through this lens,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.696
it starts to explain
why it has the unique capacity

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.816
to enable us to cope with uncertainty,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.856
to place our faith in strangers,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.760
to keep moving forward.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.176
Human beings are remarkable

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.880
at taking trust leaps.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.376
Do you remember the first time
you put your credit card details

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.616
into a website?

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.976
That's a trust leap.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.936
I distinctly remember telling my dad

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.216
that I wanted to buy a navy blue
secondhand Peugeot on eBay,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.896
and he rightfully pointed out

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.296
that the seller's name
was "Invisible Wizard"

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.416
and that this probably
was not such a good idea.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.136
(Laughter)

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.576
So my work, my research
focuses on how technology

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.256
is transforming
the social glue of society,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.936
trust between people,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.216
and it's a fascinating area to study,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.616
because there's still
so much we do not know.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.736
For instance, do men and women
trust differently in digital environments?

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.656
Does the way we build trust
face-to-face translate online?

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.616
Does trust transfer?

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.336
So if you trust finding a mate on Tinder,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.720
are you more likely
to trust finding a ride on BlaBlaCar?

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.696
But from studying hundreds
of networks and marketplaces,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.536
there is a common pattern
that people follow,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.216
and I call it "climbing the trust stack."

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.440
Let me use BlaBlaCar
as an example to bring it to life.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.376
On the first level,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.576
you have to trust the idea.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.816
So you have to trust

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.240
the idea of ride-sharing
is safe and worth trying.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.336
The second level is about having
confidence in the platform,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.496
that BlaBlaCar will help you
if something goes wrong.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.176
And the third level is about
using little bits of information

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.680
to decide whether
the other person is trustworthy.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.816
Now, the first time
we climb the trust stack,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.096
it feels weird, even risky,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.096
but we get to a point
where these ideas seem totally normal.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.416
Our behaviors transform,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.416
often relatively quickly.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.240
In other words, trust enables
change and innovation.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.696
So an idea that intrigued me,
and I'd like you to consider,

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.256
is whether we can better understand

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.456
major waves of disruption and change
in individuals in society

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.536
through the lens of trust.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.856
Well, it turns out
that trust has only evolved

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.536
in three significant chapters
throughout the course of human history:

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.776
local, institutional

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.200
and what we're now entering, distributed.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.016
So for a long time,

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.296
until the mid-1800s,

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.256
trust was built
around tight-knit relationships.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.296
So say I lived in a village

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.896
with the first five rows of this audience,

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.856
and we all knew one another,

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.776
and say I wanted to borrow money.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.776
The man who had his eyes wide open,
he might lend it to me,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.896
and if I didn't pay him back,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.576
you'd all know I was dodgy.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.256
I would get a bad reputation,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.336
and you would refuse
to do business with me in the future.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.576
Trust was mostly local
and accountability-based.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.936
In the mid-19th century,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.376
society went through
a tremendous amount of change.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.176
People moved to fast-growing cities
such as London and San Francisco,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.056
and a local banker here
was replaced by large corporations

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.976
that didn't know us as individuals.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.976
We started to place our trust

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.576
into black box systems of authority,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.896
things like legal contracts
and regulation and insurance,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.936
and less trust directly in other people.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.816
Trust became institutional
and commission-based.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.656
It's widely talked about how trust
in institutions and many corporate brands

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.416
has been steadily declining
and continues to do so.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.056
I am constantly stunned
by major breaches of trust:

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.576
the News Corp phone hacking,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.416
the Volkswagen emissions scandal,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.775
the widespread abuse
in the Catholic Church,

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.015
the fact that only one measly banker

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.336
went to jail after the great
financial crisis,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.416
or more recently the Panama Papers

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.576
that revealed how the rich
can exploit offshore tax regimes.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.056
And the thing that really surprises me

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.096
is why do leaders find it so hard

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.296
to apologize, I mean sincerely apologize,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.480
when our trust is broken?

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.496
It would be easy to conclude
that institutional trust isn't working

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.016
because we are fed up

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.936
with the sheer audacity
of dishonest elites,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.936
but what's happening now

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:21.576
runs deeper than the rampant questioning
of the size and structure of institutions.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.616
We're starting to realize

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.416
that institutional trust

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.416
wasn't designed for the digital age.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.096
Conventions of how trust is built,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.456
managed, lost and repaired --

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.976
in brands, leaders and entire systems --

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
is being turned upside down.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.856
Now, this is exciting,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.416
but it's frightening,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.136
because it forces many of us
to have to rethink

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.856
how trust is built and destroyed
with our customers, with our employees,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.360
even our loved ones.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.976
The other day, I was talking to the CEO
of a leading international hotel brand,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.240
and as is often the case,
we got onto the topic of Airbnb.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.936
And he admitted to me
that he was perplexed by their success.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.096
He was perplexed at how a company

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.296
that depends on the willingness
of strangers to trust one another

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.280
could work so well across 191 countries.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.056
So I said to him
that I had a confession to make,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.056
and he looked at me a bit strangely,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.456
and I said --

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.496
and I'm sure many of you
do this as well --

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.016
I don't always bother to hang my towels up

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.976
when I'm finished in the hotel,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.640
but I would never do this
as a guest on Airbnb.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.896
And the reason why I would never do this
as a guest on Airbnb

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.576
is because guests know
that they'll be rated by hosts,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.336
and that those ratings
are likely to impact their ability

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.040
to transact in the future.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.896
It's a simple illustration of how
online trust will change our behaviors

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.216
in the real world,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.736
make us more accountable

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.200
in ways we cannot yet even imagine.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.936
I am not saying we do not need hotels

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.296
or traditional forms of authority.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.416
But what we cannot deny

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.696
is that the way trust
flows through society is changing,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.016
and it's creating this big shift

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.896
away from the 20th century

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.736
that was defined by institutional trust

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.256
towards the 21st century

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.920
that will be fueled by distributed trust.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.656
Trust is no longer top-down.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.776
It's being unbundled and inverted.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.640
It's no longer opaque and linear.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.136
A new recipe for trust is emerging

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.056
that once again
is distributed amongst people

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.216
and is accountability-based.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.656
And this shift is only going to accelerate

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.416
with the emergence of the blockchain,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.080
the innovative ledger technology
underpinning Bitcoin.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.736
Now let's be honest,

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.216
getting our heads around
the way blockchain works

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.680
is mind-blowing.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.976
And one of the reasons why
is it involves processing

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.656
some pretty complicated concepts

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.176
with terrible names.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.696
I mean, cryptographic algorithms
and hash functions,

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.776
and people called miners,
who verify transactions --

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.376
all that was created
by this mysterious person

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.136
or persons called Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.816
Now, that is a massive trust leap
that hasn't happened yet.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.896
(Applause)

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.376
But let's try to imagine this.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.096
So "The Economist"
eloquently described the blockchain

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.776
as the great chain
of being sure about things.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.856
The easiest way I can describe it
is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.856
and they are filled with assets.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.296
So that could be a property title.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.336
It could be a stock trade.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.320
It could be a creative asset,
such as the rights to a song.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.976
Every time something moves

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.816
from one place on the register
to somewhere else,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.936
that asset transfer is time-stamped

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.376
and publicly recorded on the blockchain.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.280
It's that simple. Right.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.816
So the real implication of the blockchain

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.976
is that it removes the need
for any kind of third party,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.336
such as a lawyer,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.816
or a trusted intermediary,
or maybe not a government intermediary

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.656
to facilitate the exchange.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.936
So if we go back to the trust stack,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.696
you still have to trust the idea,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.016
you have to trust the platform,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.976
but you don't have to trust
the other person

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.936
in the traditional sense.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.456
The implications are huge.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.176
In the same way the internet blew open
the doors to an age of information

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.616
available to everyone,

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.960
the blockchain will revolutionize
trust on a global scale.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.176
Now, I've waited to the end
intentionally to mention Uber,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.656
because I recognize
that it is a contentious

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.296
and widely overused example,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.560
but in the context of a new era of trust,
it's a great case study.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.656
Now, we will see cases of abuse
of distributed trust.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.336
We've already seen this,
and it can go horribly wrong.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.536
I am not surprised that we are seeing
protests from taxi associations

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.896
all around the world

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.800
trying to get governments to ban Uber
based on claims that it is unsafe.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.696
I happened to be in London
the day that these protests took place,

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.696
and I happened to notice a tweet

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.336
from Matt Hancock, who is
a British minister for business.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.576
And he wrote,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.576
"Does anyone have details of this
#Uber app everyone's talking about?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.800
(Laughter)

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.520
I'd never heard of it until today."

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.840
Now, the taxi associations,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.536
they legitimized the first layer
of the trust stack.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.896
They legitimized the idea
that they were trying to eliminate,

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:07.056
and sign-ups increased
by 850 percent in 24 hours.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.336
Now, this is a really strong illustration

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:16.176
of how once a trust shift has happened
around a behavior or an entire sector,

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.440
you cannot reverse the story.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.976
Every day, five million people
will take a trust leap

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.536
and ride with Uber.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.776
In China, on Didi,
the ride-sharing platform,

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.696
11 million rides taken every day.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.336
That's 127 rides per second,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.176
showing that this is
a cross-cultural phenomenon.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.376
And the fascinating thing is
that both drivers and passengers report

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.896
that seeing a name

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.896
and seeing someone's photo
and their rating

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.176
makes them feel safer,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.776
and as you may have experienced,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.760
even behave a little more nicely
in the taxi cab.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.056
Uber and Didi are early
but powerful examples

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.056
of how technology
is creating trust between people

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.360
in ways and on a scale
never possible before.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:13.176
Today, many of us are comfortable
getting into cars driven by strangers.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.496
We meet up with someone
we swiped right to be matched with.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.456
We share our homes
with people we do not know.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.840
This is just the beginning,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.016
because the real disruption happening

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.976
isn't technological.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.320
It's the trust shift it creates,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.976
and for my part, I want to help people
understand this new era of trust

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.656
so that we can get it right

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.576
and we can embrace
the opportunities to redesign systems

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.696
that are more transparent,
inclusive and accountable.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.976
Thank you very much.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.576
(Applause)

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.816
Thank you.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.548
(Applause)
