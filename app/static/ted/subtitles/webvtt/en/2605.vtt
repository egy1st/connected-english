WEBVTT

00:00:01.723 --> 00:00:03.111
Please meet Jane.

00:00:03.644 --> 00:00:05.639
She has a high-risk pregnancy.

00:00:05.663 --> 00:00:07.420
Within 24 weeks,

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:09.605
she's on bed rest at the hospital,

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.456
being monitored
for her preterm contractions.

00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:14.918
She doesn't look the happiest.

00:00:14.942 --> 00:00:18.163
That's in part because it requires
technicians and experts

00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:22.502
to apply these clunky belts on her
to monitor her uterine contractions.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.290
Another reason Jane is not so happy
is because she's worried.

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:31.394
In particular, she's worried
about what happens

00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:34.823
after her 10-day stay
on bed rest at the hospital.

00:00:35.438 --> 00:00:37.508
What happens when she's home?

00:00:37.532 --> 00:00:41.261
If she were to give birth this early
it would be devastating.

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:43.628
As an African-American woman,

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:46.734
she's twice as likely
to have a premature birth

00:00:47.376 --> 00:00:48.949
or to have a stillbirth.

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:52.529
So Jane basically has one of two options:

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:54.578
stay at the hospital on bed rest,

00:00:55.237 --> 00:00:58.695
a prisoner to the technology
until she gives birth,

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.409
and then spend the rest
of her life paying for the bill;

00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:07.554
or head home after her 10-day stay
and hope for the best.

00:01:08.198 --> 00:01:11.293
Neither of these two options
seems appealing.

00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:14.243
As I began to think
about stories like this

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:16.053
and hear about stories like this,

00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:18.170
I began to ask myself and imagine:

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:19.736
Is there an alternative?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.496
Is there a way we could have
the benefits of high-fidelity monitoring

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.319
that we get with our trusted
partners in the hospital

00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:29.702
while someone is at home
living their daily life?

00:01:30.832 --> 00:01:32.327
With that in mind,

00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:34.298
I encouraged people in my research group

00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:37.830
to partner with some
clever material scientists,

00:01:37.854 --> 00:01:40.261
and all of us came together
and brainstormed.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:42.345
And after a long process,

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.763
we came up with a vision, an idea,

00:01:44.787 --> 00:01:48.565
of a wearable system that perhaps
you could wear like a piece of jewelry

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:51.045
or you could apply
to yourself like a Band-Aid.

00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:55.646
And after many trials and tribulations
and years of endeavors,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.397
we were able to come up
with this flexible electronic patch

00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:01.816
that was manufactured
using the same processes

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.521
that they use to build computer chips,

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:08.977
except the electronics are transferred
from a semiconductor wafer

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.269
onto a flexible material
that can interface with the human body.

00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:16.823
These systems are about
the thickness of a human hair.

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:21.259
They can measure the types
of information that we want,

00:02:21.948 --> 00:02:23.127
things such as:

00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:24.324
bodily movement,

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.074
bodily temperature,

00:02:26.098 --> 00:02:27.903
electrical rhythms of the body

00:02:27.927 --> 00:02:29.085
and so forth.

00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:31.377
We can also engineer these systems,

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:34.291
so they can integrate energy sources,

00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:37.842
and can have wireless
transmission capabilities.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:42.529
So as we began to build
these types of systems,

00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:46.891
we began to test them on ourselves
in our research group.

00:02:46.915 --> 00:02:50.279
But in addition, we began to reach out
to some of our clinical partners

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:51.458
in San Diego,

00:02:51.482 --> 00:02:55.182
and test these on different patients
in different clinical conditions,

00:02:55.206 --> 00:02:57.903
including moms-to-be like Jane.

00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:03.511
Here is a picture of a pregnant woman
in labor at our university hospital

00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:08.466
being monitored for her uterine
contractions with the conventional belt.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.090
In addition,

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:12.706
our flexible electronic patches are there.

00:03:13.268 --> 00:03:17.544
This picture demonstrates waveforms
pertaining to the fetal heart rate,

00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:20.485
where the red corresponds
to what was acquired

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.088
with the conventional belts,

00:03:22.112 --> 00:03:24.770
and the blue corresponds to our estimates

00:03:24.794 --> 00:03:28.482
using our flexible electronic systems
and our algorithms.

00:03:28.932 --> 00:03:30.380
At this moment,

00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:33.022
we gave ourselves a big mental high five.

00:03:33.508 --> 00:03:36.915
Some of the things we had imagined
were beginning to come to fruition,

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.616
and we were actually seeing this
in a clinical context.

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:41.523
But there was still a problem.

00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:45.335
The problem was, the way
we manufactured these systems

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.816
was very inefficient,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.997
had low yield

00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:49.365
and was very error-prone.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:51.256
In addition,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.752
as we talked to some
of the nurses in the hospital,

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:55.966
they encouraged us to make sure

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.003
that our electronics worked
with typical medical adhesives

00:04:00.027 --> 00:04:01.484
that are used in a hospital.

00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:04.431
We had an epiphany and said,
"Wait a minute.

00:04:04.998 --> 00:04:07.669
Rather than just making
them work with adhesives,

00:04:07.693 --> 00:04:10.721
let's integrate them into adhesives,

00:04:11.194 --> 00:04:13.697
and that could solve
our manufacturing problem."

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.260
This picture that you see here

00:04:16.284 --> 00:04:20.779
is our ability to embed these censors
inside of a piece of Scotch tape

00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:23.519
by simply peeling it off of a wafer.

00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:27.624
Ongoing work in our research group
allows us to, in addition,

00:04:27.648 --> 00:04:31.357
embed integrated circuits
into the flexible adhesives

00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:35.071
to do things like amplifying signals
and digitizing them,

00:04:35.095 --> 00:04:36.273
processing them

00:04:36.297 --> 00:04:38.560
and encoding for wireless transmission.

00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:43.015
All of this integrated
into the same medical adhesives

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.849
that are used in the hospital.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.302
So when we reached this point,

00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:49.750
we had some other challenges,

00:04:49.774 --> 00:04:53.089
from both an engineering
as well as a usability perspective,

00:04:53.113 --> 00:04:55.936
to make sure that we could
make it used practically.

00:04:57.207 --> 00:04:59.694
In many digital health discussions,

00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:04.665
people believe in and embrace the idea
that we can simply digitize the data,

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.269
wirelessly transmit it,

00:05:06.293 --> 00:05:07.767
send it to the cloud,

00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:08.988
and in the cloud,

00:05:09.012 --> 00:05:11.745
we can extract meaningful
information for interpretation.

00:05:12.147 --> 00:05:14.624
And indeed, you can do all of that,

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:17.637
if you're not worried
about some of the energy challenges.

00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:19.324
Think about Jane for a moment.

00:05:19.348 --> 00:05:21.152
She doesn't live in Palo Alto,

00:05:21.176 --> 00:05:22.889
nor does she live in Beverly Hills.

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:24.517
What that means is,

00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:27.871
we have to be mindful about her data plan
and how much it would cost

00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:31.514
for her to be sending out
a continuous stream of data.

00:05:32.383 --> 00:05:33.662
There's another challenge

00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:37.384
that not everyone in the medical
profession is comfortable talking about.

00:05:37.408 --> 00:05:40.236
And that is, that Jane
does not have the most trust

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.745
in the medical establishment.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.599
She, people like her, her ancestors,
have not had the best experiences

00:05:47.623 --> 00:05:50.619
at the hands of doctors and the hospital

00:05:51.163 --> 00:05:52.551
or insurance companies.

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:56.807
That means that we have to be mindful
of questions of privacy.

00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:58.452
Jane might not feel that happy

00:05:58.476 --> 00:06:01.755
about all that data
being processed into the cloud.

00:06:02.712 --> 00:06:04.708
And Jane cannot be fooled;

00:06:05.346 --> 00:06:06.830
she reads the news.

00:06:06.854 --> 00:06:09.824
She knows that if the federal
government can be hacked,

00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:11.849
if the Fortune 500 can be hacked,

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:13.920
so can her doctor.

00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:16.749
And so with that in mind,

00:06:16.773 --> 00:06:17.969
we had an epiphany.

00:06:18.858 --> 00:06:21.588
We cannot outsmart
all the hackers in the world,

00:06:21.612 --> 00:06:24.379
but perhaps we can present
them a smaller target.

00:06:24.986 --> 00:06:27.167
What if we could actually,

00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:31.123
rather than have those algorithms
that do data interpretation

00:06:31.147 --> 00:06:32.360
run in the cloud,

00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:36.315
what if we have those algorithms run
on those small integrated circuits

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.419
embedded into those adhesives?

00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:42.089
And so when we integrate
these things together,

00:06:42.113 --> 00:06:45.617
what this means is that now
we can think about the future

00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:49.706
where someone like Jane can still
go about living her normal daily life,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.202
she can be monitored,

00:06:51.226 --> 00:06:54.726
it can be done in a way where
she doesn't have to get another job

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.215
to pay her data plan,

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:59.934
and we can also address
some of her concerns about privacy.

00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:02.057
So at this point,

00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:04.085
we're feeling very good about ourselves.

00:07:04.109 --> 00:07:05.272
We've accomplished this,

00:07:05.296 --> 00:07:08.466
we've begun to address some
of these questions about privacy

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.381
and we feel like, pretty much
the chapter is closed now.

00:07:12.405 --> 00:07:15.079
Everyone lived happily ever after, right?

00:07:16.751 --> 00:07:18.314
Well, not so fast.

00:07:18.338 --> 00:07:19.543
(Laughter)

00:07:19.567 --> 00:07:22.607
One of the things we have to remember,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:26.012
is that Jane does not have the most trust
in the medical establishment.

00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:27.199
We have to remember

00:07:27.223 --> 00:07:30.737
that there are increasing
and widening health disparities,

00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:34.065
and there's inequity in terms
of proper care management.

00:07:34.616 --> 00:07:37.110
And so what that means
is that this simple picture

00:07:37.134 --> 00:07:38.779
of Jane and her data --

00:07:38.803 --> 00:07:42.730
even with her being comfortable
being wirelessly transmitted to the cloud,

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:45.069
letting a doctor intervene if necessary --

00:07:45.093 --> 00:07:46.559
is not the whole story.

00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:48.485
So what we're beginning to do

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:53.336
is to think about ways to have
trusted parties serve as intermediaries

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.778
between people like Jane
and her health care providers.

00:07:56.802 --> 00:07:59.813
For example, we've begun
to partner with churches

00:07:59.837 --> 00:08:02.694
and to think about nurses
that are church members,

00:08:02.718 --> 00:08:04.740
that come from that trusted community,

00:08:04.764 --> 00:08:08.687
as patient advocates and health coaches
to people like Jane.

00:08:09.462 --> 00:08:11.469
Another thing we have going for us

00:08:11.493 --> 00:08:13.529
is that insurance companies, increasingly,

00:08:13.553 --> 00:08:15.511
are attracted to some of these ideas.

00:08:15.906 --> 00:08:17.613
They're increasingly realizing

00:08:17.637 --> 00:08:20.577
that perhaps it's better
to pay one dollar now

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:23.584
for a wearable device and a health coach,

00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:25.774
rather than paying 10 dollars later,

00:08:26.253 --> 00:08:28.807
when that baby is born prematurely

00:08:28.831 --> 00:08:31.772
and ends up in the neonatal
intensive care unit --

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:34.691
one of the most expensive
parts of a hospital.

00:08:35.697 --> 00:08:38.118
This has been a long
learning process for us.

00:08:38.593 --> 00:08:42.428
This iterative process of breaking
through and attacking one problem

00:08:42.452 --> 00:08:44.223
and not feeling totally comfortable,

00:08:44.247 --> 00:08:46.066
and identifying the next problem,

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.147
has helped us go along this path

00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:51.247
of actually trying to not only
innovate with this technology

00:08:51.271 --> 00:08:55.223
but make sure it can be used for people
who perhaps need it the most.

00:08:55.709 --> 00:08:58.493
Another learning lesson
we've taken from this process

00:08:58.517 --> 00:08:59.896
that is very humbling,

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.247
is that as technology progresses
and advances at an accelerating rate,

00:09:04.271 --> 00:09:08.213
we have to remember that human beings
are using this technology,

00:09:08.237 --> 00:09:09.839
and we have to be mindful

00:09:09.863 --> 00:09:13.303
that these human beings --
they have a face,

00:09:13.327 --> 00:09:14.589
they have a name

00:09:14.613 --> 00:09:15.774
and a life.

00:09:15.798 --> 00:09:17.409
And in the case of Jane,

00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:18.889
hopefully, two.

00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:21.235
Thank you.

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:26.497
(Applause)
