00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.719
The great philosopher Aristotle said

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.320
if something doesn't exist,
there's no word for it,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.776
and if there's no word for something,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.440
that something doesn't exist.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.335
So when we talk about elections,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.936
we in established democracies,
we know what we're talking about.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.056
We've got the words.
We have the vocabulary.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.976
We know what a polling station is.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.720
We know what a ballot paper is.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.720
But what about countries
where democracy doesn't exist,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.056
countries where there are
no words to describe the concepts

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.520
that underpin a democratic society?

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.856
I work in the field
of electoral assistance,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.016
so that's to say we assist

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.176
emerging democracies to organize

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.080
what is often their first elections.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.896
When people ask me what I do,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.336
quite often I get this answer.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.176
"Oh, so you're one of these people
who goes around the world

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.120
imposing Western democracy
on countries that can't handle it."

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.840
Well, the United Nations
does not impose anything on anybody.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.816
It really doesn't,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.216
and also, what we do

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.536
is firmly anchored in the 1948
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.656
Article 21, that says

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.200
that everybody should have the right
to choose who governs them.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.536
So that's the basis of the work.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.456
I specialize in public outreach.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.896
What does that mean? Another jargon.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.696
It actually means
designing information campaigns

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.136
so that candidates and voters

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.456
who have never had the opportunity
to participate or to vote

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.216
understand where, when, how to register;

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.456
where, when, how to vote;

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.000
why, why it is important to take part.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.016
So I'll probably devise a specific
campaign to reach out to women

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.056
to make sure that they can take part,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.376
that they can be part of the process.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.256
Young people as well.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.496
All sorts of people.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.936
Handicapped people.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.560
We try to reach everybody.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.256
And it's not always easy,
because very often in this work,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.416
I've noticed now over the years
that I've been doing it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.856
that words are lacking,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.520
and so what do you do?

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.320
Afghanistan.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.696
It's a country with
high levels of illiteracy,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.576
and the thing about that was,
it was in 2005,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.576
and we organized two elections
on the same day.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.816
The reason was because the logistics
are so incredibly difficult,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.096
it seemed to be more efficient to do that.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.336
It was,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.816
but on the other hand,
explaining two elections instead of one

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.336
was even more complicated.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.696
So we used a lot of images,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.520
and when it came to the actual ballot,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.456
we had problems, because
so many people wanted to take part,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.416
we had 300 candidates for 52 seats

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.480
in the Wolesi Jirga,
which is the parliamentary elections.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.216
And for the Provincial Council,
we had even more candidates.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.800
We had 330 for 54 seats.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.520
So talking about ballot design,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.640
this is what the ballot looked like.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.216
It's the size of a newspaper.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.000
This was the Wolesi Jirga ballot --

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:20.576
(Laughter)

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.960
Yeah, and --

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.080
this was the Provincial Council ballot.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.696
Even more.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.656
So you see, we did use
a lot of symbols and things like that.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.456
And we had other problems
in Southern Sudan.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.216
Southern Sudan was a very different story.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.336
We had so many people
who had never, of course, voted,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.160
but we had extremely, extremely
high levels of illiteracy,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.896
very, very poor infrastructure.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.496
For example -- I mean, it's a country
the size of Texas, more or less.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.400
We had seven kilometers of paved roads,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.336
seven kilometers in the whole country,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.496
and that includes the tarmac
where we landed the planes

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.056
in Juba Airport.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.216
So transporting electoral materials, etc.,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.496
is exceedingly difficult.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.495
People had no idea
about what a box looked like.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.815
It was very complicated,

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:22.936
so using verbal communication
was obviously the way to go,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.960
but there were 132 languages.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.720
So that was extremely challenging.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.336
Then I arrived in Tunisia in 2011.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.016
It was the Arab Spring.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.336
A huge amount of hope was generated
by that enormous movement

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.936
that was going on in the region.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.096
There was Libya,
there was Egypt, there was Yemen.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.136
It was an enormous, enormous
historical moment.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.736
And I was sitting
with the election commission,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.496
and we were talking
about various aspects of the election,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.856
and I was hearing them using words
that I hadn't actually heard before,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.096
and I'd worked with Iraqis,
I'd worked with Jordanians, Egyptians,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.536
and suddenly they were using these words,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.416
and I just thought, "This is strange."

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.336
And what really gave rise to it
was this word "observer."

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.616
We were discussing election observers,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.456
and the election commissioner
was talking about "mulahiz" in Arabic.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.576
This means "to notice"
in a passive sort of sense,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.216
as in, "I noticed
he was wearing a light blue shirt."

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.936
Did I go and check whether
the shirt was light blue or not?

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.936
That is the role of an election observer.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.016
It's very active, it's governed
by all kinds of treaties,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.816
and it has got
that control function in it.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.016
And then I got wind
of the fact that in Egypt,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.376
they were using this term "mutabiâ€™,"
which means "to follow."

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.696
So we were now having
followers of an election.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.296
So that's not quite right either,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.082
because there is a term
that's already accepted and in use,

00:05:50.106 --> 00:05:53.376
which was the word "muraqib"
which means "a controller."

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.536
It's got that notion of control.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.296
So I thought, three words
for one concept. This is not good.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.416
And with our colleagues,
we thought perhaps it's our role

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.496
to actually help make sure
that the words are understood

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.656
and actually create a work of reference

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.336
that could be used across the Arab region.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.616
And that's what we did.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.296
So together with these colleagues,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.296
we launched the "Arabic Lexicon
of Electoral Terminology,"

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.640
and we worked
in eight different countries.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.176
It meant actually defining 481 terms

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.056
which formed the basis
of everything you need to know

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.440
if you're going to organize
a democratic election.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.216
And we defined these terms,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.216
and we worked with the Arab colleagues

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.016
and came to an agreement
about what would be the appropriate word

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.616
to use in Arabic.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.896
Because the Arabic language is very rich,
and that's part of the problem.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.896
But there are 22 countries
that speak Arabic,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.616
and they use modern standard Arabic,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.496
which is the Arabic
that is used across the whole region

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.016
in newspapers and broadcasts,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.936
but of course, then from one country
to the next in day to day language and use

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.296
it varies -- dialect, colloquialisms, etc.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.896
So that was another
added layer of complication.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.416
So in one sense you had the problem

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.096
that language wasn't
fully ripe, if you like,

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.800
neologisms were coming up,
new expressions.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.056
And so we defined all these terms,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.376
and then we had
eight correspondents in the region.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.296
We submitted the draft to them,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.896
they responded back to us.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.536
"Yes, we understand the definition.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.256
We agree with it,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.456
but this is what we say in our country."

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.096
Because we were not going
to harmonize or force harmonization.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.120
We were trying to facilitate
understanding among people.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.696
So in yellow, you see
the different expressions in use

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.040
in the various countries.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.936
So this, I'm happy to say,
it took three years to produce this

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.296
because we also finalized the draft
and took it actually into the field,

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.463
sat with the election commissions
in all these different countries,

00:08:01.487 --> 00:08:04.376
debated and defined and refined the draft,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.416
and finally published it
in November 2014 in Cairo.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.696
And it's gone a long way.
We published 10,000 copies.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.936
To date, there's about 3,000 downloads
off the internet in PDF form.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.856
I heard just recently from a colleague
that they've taken it up in Somalia.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.776
They're going to produce
a version of this in Somalia,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.816
because there's nothing in Somalia at all.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.856
So that's very good to know.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.135
And this newly formed Arab Organization
for Electoral Management Bodies,

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.096
which is trying to professionalize

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.416
how elections are run in the region,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.535
they're using it as well.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:47.496
And the Arab League have now
built up a pan-Arab observation unit,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.776
and they're using it.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.416
So that's all really good.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.256
However, this work of reference
is quite high-pitched.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.176
It's complex, and a lot of the terms
are quite technical,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.360
so the average person probably doesn't
need to know at least a third of it.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.016
But the people of the Middle East

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.536
have been deprived of any form
of what we know as civic education.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.336
It's part of our curriculum at school.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.456
It doesn't really exist
in that part of the world,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.896
and I feel it's really
the right of everybody

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.016
to know how these things work.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.656
And it's a good thing to think about
producing a work of reference

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.336
for the average person,

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.496
and bearing in mind that now

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.696
we have a basis to work with,

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.856
but also we have technology,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.256
so we can reach out using telephone apps,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.416
video, animation.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.736
There's all sorts of tools
that can be used now

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.256
to communicate these ideas to people

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.000
for the first time in their own language.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.456
We hear a lot of misery
about the Middle East.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.656
We hear the chaos of war.
We hear terrorism.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.216
We hear about sectarianism
and all this horrible negative news

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.896
that comes to us all the time.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.776
What we're not hearing is what are
the people, the everyday people, thinking?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.400
What are they aspiring to?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.880
Let's give them the means,
let's give them the words.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.696
The silent majority is silent

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.800
because they don't have the words.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.720
The silent majority needs to know.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.456
It is time to provide people
with the knowledge tools

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.720
that they can inform themselves with.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.056
The silent majority
does not need to be silent.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.376
Let's help them have a voice.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.656
Thank you very much.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.502
