00:00:00.836 --> 00:00:03.793
Some people are obsessed
by French wines.

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:06.524
Others love playing golf

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:08.187
or devouring literature.

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:12.304
One of my greatest pleasures
in life is, I have to admit,

00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:13.534
a bit special.

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:18.914
I cannot tell you how much I enjoy
watching cities from the sky,

00:00:18.938 --> 00:00:20.319
from an airplane window.

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:23.911
Some cities are calmly industrious,

00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:25.475
like Dusseldorf

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.140
or Louisville.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.413
Others project an energy
that they can hardly contain,

00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:32.754
like New York

00:00:32.778 --> 00:00:34.003
or Hong Kong.

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:36.806
And then you have Paris

00:00:37.492 --> 00:00:39.204
or Istanbul,

00:00:39.228 --> 00:00:41.201
and their patina full of history.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.158
I see cities as living beings.

00:00:44.514 --> 00:00:46.982
And when I discover them from far above,

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:51.431
I like to find those main streets
and highways that structure their space.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.495
Especially at night,

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.342
when commuters make these arteries
look dramatically red and golden:

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:03.195
the city's vascular system
performing its vital function

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.429
right before your eyes.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:08.409
But when I'm sitting in my car

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.312
after an hour and a half
of commute every day,

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:14.213
that reality looks very different.

00:01:14.237 --> 00:01:15.291
(Laughter)

00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:16.473
Nothing --

00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:18.187
not public radio,

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.370
no podcast --

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:20.422
(Laughter)

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.455
Not even mindfulness meditation

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.094
makes this time worth living.

00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:25.727
(Laughter)

00:01:26.072 --> 00:01:27.226
Isn't it absurd

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.707
that we created cars
that can reach 130 miles per hour

00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:37.353
and we now drive them at the same speed
as 19th-century horse carriages?

00:01:37.377 --> 00:01:38.636
(Laughter)

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.402
In the US alone,

00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:45.820
we spent 29.6 billion hours
commuting in 2014.

00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:47.899
With that amount of time,

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:52.214
ancient Egyptians could have built
26 Pyramids of Giza.

00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:53.284
(Laughter)

00:01:53.308 --> 00:01:54.706
We do that in one year.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.106
A monumental waste of time,
energy and human potential.

00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:01.331
For decades,

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:03.663
our remedy for congestion was simple:

00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:06.728
build new roads or enlarge existing ones.

00:02:07.198 --> 00:02:08.348
And it worked.

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:10.830
It worked admirably for Paris,

00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:13.944
when the city tore down
hundreds of historical buildings

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:15.615
to create 85 miles

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.920
of transportation-friendly boulevards.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.099
And it still works today
in fast-growing emerging cities.

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.945
But in more established urban centers,

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.899
significant network expansions
are almost impossible:

00:02:28.923 --> 00:02:30.843
habitat is just too dense,

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:32.840
real estate, too expensive

00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:34.924
and public finances, too fragile.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.385
Our city's vascular system
is getting clogged, it's getting sick,

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.016
and we should pay attention.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.743
Our current way
of thinking is not working.

00:02:44.172 --> 00:02:46.093
For our transportation to flow,

00:02:46.117 --> 00:02:48.468
we need a new source of inspiration.

00:02:50.187 --> 00:02:52.879
So after 16 years
working in transportation,

00:02:53.437 --> 00:02:56.983
my "aha moment" happened
when speaking with a biotech customer.

00:02:57.622 --> 00:02:59.650
She was telling me how her treatment

00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:02.917
was leveraging specific properties
of our vascular system.

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:06.050
"Wow," I thought, "Our vascular system --

00:03:06.074 --> 00:03:09.150
all the veins and arteries in our body

00:03:09.174 --> 00:03:12.381
making miracles of logistics every day."

00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:15.270
This is the moment I realized

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:18.277
that biology has been
in the transportation business

00:03:18.301 --> 00:03:19.812
for billions of years.

00:03:20.364 --> 00:03:22.728
It has been testing countless solutions

00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:26.051
to move nutrients, gases and proteins.

00:03:26.532 --> 00:03:30.893
It really is the world's most
sophisticated transportation laboratory.

00:03:31.326 --> 00:03:36.829
So, what if the solution to our traffic
challenges was inside us?

00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:39.160
I wanted to know:

00:03:39.184 --> 00:03:42.980
Why is it that blood flows
in our veins most of our lives,

00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:46.596
when our big cities get clogged
on a daily basis?

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.554
And the reality is that you're looking
at two very different networks.

00:03:52.013 --> 00:03:53.832
I don't know if you realize,

00:03:54.223 --> 00:03:58.920
but each of us has 60,000 miles
of blood vessels in our bodies --

00:03:58.944 --> 00:04:00.238
60,000 miles.

00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:02.854
That's two-and-a-half times
the Earth's circumference,

00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:04.131
inside you.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.179
What it means is that blood vessels
are everywhere inside us,

00:04:08.203 --> 00:04:10.230
not just under the surface of our skin.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.819
But if you look at our cities,

00:04:12.843 --> 00:04:15.941
yes, we have some
underground subway systems

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:18.381
and some tunnels and bridges,

00:04:18.405 --> 00:04:20.685
and also some helicopters in the sky.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.768
But the vast majority of our traffic
is focused on the ground,

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:25.969
on the surface.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.805
So in other words,

00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:32.208
while our vascular system uses
the three dimensions inside us,

00:04:32.232 --> 00:04:34.996
our urban transportation
is mostly two-dimensional.

00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:38.914
And so what we need
is to embrace that verticality.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.855
If our surface grid is saturated,

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.777
well, let's elevate our traffic.

00:04:44.174 --> 00:04:48.058
This Chinese concept of a bus
that can straddle traffic jams --

00:04:48.694 --> 00:04:53.079
that was an eye-opener on new ways
to think about space and movement

00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:54.389
inside our cities.

00:04:54.863 --> 00:04:56.675
And we can go higher,

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.991
and suspend our transportation
like we did with our electrical grid.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.985
Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi
are talking about testing

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.841
these futuristic networks
of suspended magnetic pods.

00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:12.361
And we can keep climbing, and fly.

00:05:13.263 --> 00:05:15.190
The fact that a company like Airbus

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:18.522
is now seriously working
on flying urban taxis

00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:19.919
is telling us something.

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:25.501
Flying cars are finally moving
from science-fiction déjà vu

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:28.214
to attractive business-case territory.

00:05:28.238 --> 00:05:29.848
And that's an exciting moment.

00:05:30.415 --> 00:05:33.044
So building this 3-D
transportation network

00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:38.386
is one of the ways we can mitigate
and solve traffic jams.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.820
But it's not the only one.

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:41.875
We have to question

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:45.666
other fundamental choices
that we made, like the vehicles we use.

00:05:46.278 --> 00:05:48.618
Just imagine a very familiar scene:

00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:51.116
You've been driving for 42 minutes.

00:05:51.656 --> 00:05:54.379
The two kids behind you
are getting restless.

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:56.104
And you're late.

00:05:56.754 --> 00:05:59.019
Do you see that slow car in front of you?

00:05:59.474 --> 00:06:01.292
Always comes when you're late, right?

00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:02.451
(Laughter)

00:06:02.475 --> 00:06:04.638
That driver is looking for parking.

00:06:05.193 --> 00:06:07.410
There is no parking spot
available in the area,

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:08.777
but how would he know?

00:06:09.552 --> 00:06:14.468
It is estimated that up to 30 percent
of urban traffic is generated

00:06:14.492 --> 00:06:16.217
by drivers looking for parking.

00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:18.965
Do you see the 100 cars around you?

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:22.160
Eighty-five of them
only have one passenger.

00:06:22.571 --> 00:06:26.791
Those 85 drivers could all fit
in one Londonian red bus.

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:28.490
So the question is:

00:06:28.514 --> 00:06:31.574
Why are we wasting so much space
if it is what we need the most?

00:06:31.598 --> 00:06:33.360
Why are we doing this to ourselves?

00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:35.700
Biology would never do this.

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:39.236
Space inside our arteries
is fully utilized.

00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:41.246
At every heartbeat,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.283
a higher blood pressure literally compacts
millions of red blood cells

00:06:45.307 --> 00:06:47.425
into massive trains of oxygen

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.338
that quickly flow throughout our body.

00:06:49.771 --> 00:06:53.701
And the tiny space inside our red
blood cells is not wasted, either.

00:06:54.357 --> 00:06:56.074
In healthy conditions,

00:06:56.098 --> 00:07:00.136
more than 95 percent
of their oxygen capacity is utilized.

00:07:00.494 --> 00:07:03.355
Can you imagine if the vehicles
we used in our cities

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:05.063
were 95 percent full,

00:07:05.087 --> 00:07:08.471
all the additional space
you would have to walk, to bike

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:10.033
and to enjoy our cities?

00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:14.129
The reason blood is so
incredibly efficient

00:07:14.153 --> 00:07:17.254
is that our red blood cells
are not dedicated

00:07:17.278 --> 00:07:19.132
to specific organs or tissues;

00:07:19.497 --> 00:07:22.608
otherwise, we would probably have
traffic jams in our veins.

00:07:22.632 --> 00:07:23.864
No, they're shared.

00:07:23.888 --> 00:07:26.264
They're shared by all
the cells of our body.

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:29.390
And because our network is so extensive,

00:07:29.414 --> 00:07:34.174
each one of our 37 trillion cells
gets its own deliveries of oxygen

00:07:34.198 --> 00:07:35.727
precisely when it needs them.

00:07:36.253 --> 00:07:40.843
Blood is both a collective
and individual form of transportation.

00:07:41.513 --> 00:07:43.057
But for our cities,

00:07:43.081 --> 00:07:44.365
we've been stuck.

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:46.434
We've been stuck in an endless debate

00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:51.675
between creating a car-centric society
or extensive mass-transit systems.

00:07:52.295 --> 00:07:53.910
I think we should transcend this.

00:07:53.934 --> 00:07:58.253
I think we can create vehicles
that combine the convenience of cars

00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:00.594
and the efficiencies of trains and buses.

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:02.864
Just imagine.

00:08:02.888 --> 00:08:07.136
You're comfortably sitting
in a fast and smooth urban train,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.271
along with 1,200 passengers.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.637
The problem with urban trains

00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:16.056
is that sometimes you have to stop
five, ten, fifteen times

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.621
before your final destination.

00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:21.332
What if in this train
you didn't have to stop?

00:08:21.929 --> 00:08:23.198
In this train,

00:08:23.222 --> 00:08:26.451
wagons can detach dynamically
while you're moving

00:08:27.012 --> 00:08:29.494
and become express, driverless buses

00:08:29.518 --> 00:08:31.571
that move on a secondary road network.

00:08:32.024 --> 00:08:33.925
And so without a single stop,

00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:35.536
nor a lengthy transfer,

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.969
you are now sitting in a bus
that is headed toward your suburb.

00:08:39.647 --> 00:08:41.573
And when you get close,

00:08:41.597 --> 00:08:44.904
the section you're sitting in detaches

00:08:44.928 --> 00:08:47.878
and self-drives you
right to your doorstep.

00:08:48.523 --> 00:08:51.184
It is collective and individual
at the same time.

00:08:51.922 --> 00:08:56.799
This could be one of the shared,
modular, driverless vehicles of tomorrow.

00:08:57.681 --> 00:08:58.842
Now ...

00:08:59.217 --> 00:09:02.375
as if walking in a city
buzzing with drones,

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:06.686
flying taxis, modular buses
and suspended magnetic pods

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.161
was not exotic enough,

00:09:09.062 --> 00:09:10.999
I think there is another force in action

00:09:11.023 --> 00:09:13.604
that will make urban traffic mesmerizing.

00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:16.130
If you think about it,

00:09:16.154 --> 00:09:21.160
the current generation of driverless cars
is just trying to earn its way

00:09:21.184 --> 00:09:24.214
into a traffic grid
made by and for humans.

00:09:24.626 --> 00:09:28.039
They're trying to learn traffic rules,
which is relatively simple,

00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:30.460
and coping with human unpredictability,

00:09:30.484 --> 00:09:32.096
which is more challenging.

00:09:33.063 --> 00:09:36.490
But what would happen
when whole cities become driverless?

00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:38.827
Would we need traffic lights?

00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:40.447
Would we need lanes?

00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:41.970
How about speed limits?

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:44.852
Red blood cells are not flowing in lanes.

00:09:45.402 --> 00:09:47.363
They never stop at red lights.

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:49.363
In the first driverless cities,

00:09:49.387 --> 00:09:51.504
you would have no red lights and no lanes.

00:09:52.014 --> 00:09:55.087
And when all the cars
are driverless and connected,

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.195
everything is predictable
and reaction time, minimum.

00:09:59.219 --> 00:10:01.133
They can drive much faster

00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:04.094
and can take any rational initiative
that can speed them up

00:10:04.118 --> 00:10:05.475
or the cars around them.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.275
So instead of rigid traffic rules,

00:10:10.203 --> 00:10:11.535
flow will be regulated

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:16.386
by a mesh of dynamic and constantly
self-improving algorithms.

00:10:18.468 --> 00:10:21.195
The result: a strange traffic

00:10:21.219 --> 00:10:24.730
that mixes the fast and smooth
rigor of German autobahns

00:10:24.754 --> 00:10:28.054
and the creative vitality
of the intersections of Mumbai.

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:30.254
(Laughter)

00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:32.233
Traffic will be functionally exuberant.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.698
It will be liquid like our blood.

00:10:34.722 --> 00:10:36.478
And by a strange paradox,

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:39.313
the more robotized
our traffic grid will be,

00:10:39.337 --> 00:10:42.093
the more organic and alive
its movement will feel.

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:44.852
So yes,

00:10:44.876 --> 00:10:48.574
biology has all the attributes
of a transportation genius today.

00:10:48.598 --> 00:10:51.407
But this process has taken
billions of years,

00:10:51.431 --> 00:10:54.433
and went through all sorts
of iterations and mutations.

00:10:54.892 --> 00:10:58.320
We can't wait billions of years
to evolve our transportation system.

00:10:58.979 --> 00:11:00.807
We now have the dreams,

00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:02.123
the concepts

00:11:02.147 --> 00:11:04.453
and the technology

00:11:04.477 --> 00:11:07.327
to create 3-D transportation networks,

00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:09.066
invent new vehicles

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.714
and change the flow in our cities.

00:11:11.109 --> 00:11:12.264
Let's do it.

00:11:12.288 --> 00:11:13.452
Thank you.

00:11:13.476 --> 00:11:16.309
(Applause)
