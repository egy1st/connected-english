00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:03.817
How many of you have seen
the Alfred Hitchcock film "The Birds"?

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.857
Any of you get really freaked out by that?

00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:07.921
You might want to leave now.

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:08.976
(Laughter)

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.003
So this is a vending machine for crows.

00:00:11.027 --> 00:00:13.520
Over the past few days,
many of you have been asking,

00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:16.534
"How did you come to this?
How did you get started doing this?"

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.327
It started, as with many great ideas,

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.387
or many ideas you can't
get rid of, anyway,

00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:21.566
at a cocktail party.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.800
About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail
party with a friend of mine.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.713
We were sitting there,
and he was complaining about the crows

00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:30.108
that were all over his yard
and making a big mess.

00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:32.834
And he was telling me
we ought to eradicate these things,

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:34.830
kill them, because they're making a mess.

00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:36.005
I said that was stupid,

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:38.602
maybe we should just train them
to do something useful.

00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:40.157
And he said that was impossible.

00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:43.553
And I'm sure I'm in good company
in finding that tremendously annoying,

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.457
when someone tells you it's impossible.

00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:48.611
So I spent the next 10 years reading
about crows in my spare time.

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:51.411
(Laughter)

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:53.632
And after 10 years of this, my wife said,

00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:56.276
"You've got to do this thing
you've been talking about,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.795
and build the vending machine."

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:58.970
So I did.

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:01.439
But part of the reason
I found this interesting is,

00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:04.295
I started noticing that we're very
aware of all the species

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.114
that are going extinct on the planet

00:01:06.138 --> 00:01:08.207
as a result of human habitation expansion,

00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:11.176
and no one seems to be paying
attention to all the species

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.268
that are actually living;
they're surviving.

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:16.017
And I'm talking specifically
about synanthropic species,

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:18.719
which have adapted
specifically for human ecologies,

00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:22.106
species like rats
and cockroaches and crows.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.744
And as I started looking at them,
I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.

00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:28.160
They'd become extremely
adept at living with us.

00:01:28.184 --> 00:01:30.857
And in return, we just tried
to kill them all the time.

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:31.976
(Laughter)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.573
And in doing so, we were
breeding them for parasitism.

00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:38.558
We were giving them all sorts
of reasons to adapt new ways.

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:41.340
So, for example, rats
are incredibly responsive breeders.

00:01:41.364 --> 00:01:44.383
And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried
to get rid of them knows,

00:01:44.407 --> 00:01:47.409
have become really immune
to the poisons that we're using.

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:51.067
So I thought, let's build something
that's mutually beneficial;

00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:53.071
something that we can both benefit from,

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:56.114
and find some way to make
a new relationship with these species.

00:01:56.138 --> 00:01:57.780
So I built the vending machine.

00:01:57.804 --> 00:02:00.874
But the story of the vending machine
is a little more interesting

00:02:00.898 --> 00:02:02.285
if you know more about crows.

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:05.151
It turns out, crows aren't just
surviving with human beings;

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:06.416
they're actually thriving.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.277
They're found everywhere
on the planet except for the Arctic

00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:11.113
and the southern tip of South America.

00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:13.828
And in all that area,
they're only rarely found breeding

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:16.171
more than five kilometers
away from human beings.

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:18.945
So we may not think about them,
but they're always around.

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.613
And not surprisingly,
given the human population growth,

00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:24.613
more than half of the human population
is living in cities now.

00:02:24.637 --> 00:02:27.452
And out of those, nine-tenths
of the human growth population

00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:28.634
is occurring in cities.

00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:30.831
We're seeing a population boom with crows.

00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:32.900
So bird counts are indicating

00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:36.072
that we might be seeing up to exponential
growth in their numbers.

00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:37.743
So that's no great surprise.

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:40.260
But what was really interesting
to me was to find out

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:43.107
that the birds were adapting
in a pretty unusual way.

00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:46.268
And I'll give you an example of that.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.110
This is Betty.
She's a New Caledonian crow.

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:51.540
And these crows use sticks in the wild

00:02:51.564 --> 00:02:54.198
to get insects and whatnot
out of pieces of wood.

00:02:54.222 --> 00:02:56.888
Here, she's trying to get
a piece of meat out of a tube.

00:02:56.912 --> 00:02:58.555
But the researchers had a problem.

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.127
They messed up and left
just a stick of wire in there.

00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.674
And she hadn't had the opportunity
to do this before.

00:03:03.698 --> 00:03:05.588
You see, it wasn't working very well.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.643
So she adapted.

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:12.190
Now, this is completely unprompted;
she had never seen this done before.

00:03:12.214 --> 00:03:14.226
No one taught her to bend this into a hook

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.031
or had shown her how it could happen.

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:17.508
But she did it all on her own.

00:03:17.532 --> 00:03:19.993
So keep in mind --
she's never seen this done.

00:03:20.017 --> 00:03:21.608
(Laughter)

00:03:21.632 --> 00:03:22.815
Right.

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:29.367
(Laughter)

00:03:29.498 --> 00:03:30.922
Yeah. All right.

00:03:30.946 --> 00:03:35.591
(Applause)

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.096
So that's the part where
the researchers freak out.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.889
(Laughter)

00:03:39.913 --> 00:03:41.080
It turns out,

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:44.344
we've been finding more and more
that crows are really intelligent.

00:03:44.368 --> 00:03:47.950
Their brains are in the same proportion
as chimpanzee brains are.

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:50.066
There's all kinds of anecdotes

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.452
for the different kinds
of intelligence they have.

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:54.976
For example, in Sweden,
crows will wait for fishermen

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.893
to drop lines through holes in the ice.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:58.457
And when the fishermen move off,

00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.722
the crows fly down, reel up the lines,
and eat the fish or the bait.

00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:03.684
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:05.147
On an entirely different tack,

00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:07.761
at University of Washington
a few years ago,

00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:11.145
they were doing an experiment where
they captured some crows on campus.

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.987
Some students went out,
netted some crows, brought them in,

00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:16.595
weighed and measured them,
and let them back out again.

00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:19.831
And they were entertained to discover
that for the rest of the week,

00:04:19.855 --> 00:04:22.487
whenever these particular students
walked around campus,

00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.622
these crows would caw at them
and run around,

00:04:24.646 --> 00:04:26.458
and make their life kind of miserable.

00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:27.484
(Laughter)

00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:29.453
They were significantly less entertained

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.206
when this went on for the next week.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.503
And the next month.

00:04:32.527 --> 00:04:34.255
And after summer break.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.578
Until they finally graduated
and left campus,

00:04:36.602 --> 00:04:38.342
and -- glad to get away, I'm sure --

00:04:38.366 --> 00:04:41.605
came back sometime later, and found
the crows still remembered them.

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:42.635
(Laughter)

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.734
So, the moral being: don't piss off crows.

00:04:44.758 --> 00:04:47.977
So now, students
at the University of Washington

00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:51.373
that are studying these crows,
do so with a giant wig and a big mask.

00:04:51.397 --> 00:04:53.612
(Laughter)

00:04:53.636 --> 00:04:54.946
It's fairly interesting.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.541
(Laughter)

00:04:56.565 --> 00:04:58.489
So we know these crows are really smart,

00:04:58.513 --> 00:05:00.693
but the more I dug into this,
the more I found

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.882
that they actually have
an even more significant adaptation.

00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:08.360
Video: Crows have become
highly skilled at making a living

00:05:08.384 --> 00:05:10.731
in these new urban environments.

00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:14.666
In this Japanese city, they have devised
a way of eating a food

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.977
that normally they can't manage:

00:05:19.293 --> 00:05:21.103
drop it among the traffic.

00:05:25.303 --> 00:05:30.444
The problem now is collecting the bits,
without getting run over.

00:05:30.468 --> 00:05:32.769
Wait for the light to stop the traffic.

00:05:44.609 --> 00:05:48.075
Then, collect your cracked nut in safety.

00:05:51.702 --> 00:05:52.976
(Laughter)

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.079
(Applause)

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:56.096
Joshua Klein: Yeah, pretty interesting.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.057
What's significant about this
isn't that crows are using cars

00:05:59.081 --> 00:06:00.232
to crack nuts.

00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:01.897
In fact, that's old hat for crows.

00:06:01.921 --> 00:06:03.456
This happened about 10 years ago

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.007
in a place called Sendai City,
at a driving school

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:07.192
in the suburbs of Tokyo.

00:06:07.737 --> 00:06:08.892
And since that time,

00:06:08.916 --> 00:06:11.978
all the crows in the neighborhood
are picking up this behavior.

00:06:12.002 --> 00:06:15.029
Now every crow within five kilometers
is standing by a sidewalk,

00:06:15.053 --> 00:06:16.466
waiting to collect its lunch.

00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:20.061
So they're learning from each other.
And research bears this out.

00:06:20.085 --> 00:06:22.599
Parents seem to be teaching their young.

00:06:22.623 --> 00:06:25.473
They learn from their peers,
they learn from their enemies.

00:06:25.497 --> 00:06:26.952
If I have a little extra time,

00:06:26.976 --> 00:06:29.123
I'll tell you about a case
of crow infidelity

00:06:29.147 --> 00:06:30.585
that illustrates that nicely.

00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:33.680
The point being, they've developed
cultural adaptation.

00:06:33.704 --> 00:06:34.949
And as we heard yesterday,

00:06:34.973 --> 00:06:38.015
that's the Pandora's box
that's getting human beings in trouble,

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.912
and we're starting to see it with them.

00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:42.472
They're able to very quickly
and very flexibly adapt

00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:45.224
to new challenges and new resources
in their environment,

00:06:45.248 --> 00:06:47.493
which is really useful
if you live in a city.

00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:50.763
So we know that there's lots of crows.

00:06:50.787 --> 00:06:53.848
We found out they're really smart
and they can teach each other.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.173
When all this became clear,

00:06:55.197 --> 00:06:58.360
I realized the only obvious thing to do
is build a vending machine.

00:06:58.384 --> 00:06:59.537
So that's what we did.

00:06:59.561 --> 00:07:01.298
This is a vending machine for crows.

00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:04.989
And it uses Skinnerian training
to shape their behavior over four stages.

00:07:05.013 --> 00:07:06.370
It's pretty simple.

00:07:06.394 --> 00:07:09.398
Basically, what happens
is that we put this out in a field

00:07:09.422 --> 00:07:11.392
or someplace where there's lots of crows.

00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:14.253
We put coins and peanuts
all around the base of the machine.

00:07:14.277 --> 00:07:16.318
Crows eventually come by, eat the peanuts,

00:07:16.342 --> 00:07:18.276
and get used to the machine being there.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.081
Eventually, they eat all the peanuts.

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:22.424
Then they see peanuts
here on the feeder tray,

00:07:22.448 --> 00:07:24.170
and hop up and help themselves.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:27.067
Then they leave, the machine
spits up more coins and peanuts,

00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:28.861
and life is dandy if you're a crow --

00:07:28.885 --> 00:07:31.331
you can come back anytime
and get yourself a peanut.

00:07:31.355 --> 00:07:34.840
So when they get really used to that,
we move on to the crows coming back.

00:07:34.864 --> 00:07:36.967
Now they're used to the sound
of the machine;

00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:39.103
they keep coming back
and digging out peanuts

00:07:39.127 --> 00:07:40.850
from the pile of coins that's there.

00:07:40.874 --> 00:07:43.410
When they get really happy
about this, we stymie them.

00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:46.228
We move to the third stage,
where we only give them a coin.

00:07:46.252 --> 00:07:48.990
Now, like most of us who have gotten
used to a good thing,

00:07:49.014 --> 00:07:50.353
this really pisses them off.

00:07:50.377 --> 00:07:53.657
So they do what they do in nature
when they're looking for something:

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:55.754
sweep things out of the way
with their beak.

00:07:55.778 --> 00:07:58.620
They do that here, and that knocks
the coins down the slot.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.430
When that happens, they get a peanut.

00:08:00.454 --> 00:08:01.749
This goes on for some time.

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.209
The crows learn that
all they have to do is show up,

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.583
wait for the coin to come out,
put it in the slot,

00:08:06.607 --> 00:08:07.758
then get their peanut.

00:08:07.782 --> 00:08:09.861
When they're good
and comfortable with that,

00:08:09.885 --> 00:08:13.056
we move to the final stage,
where they show up and nothing happens.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.287
This is where we see the difference
between crows and other animals.

00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:20.023
Squirrels, for example, would show up,
look for the peanut, go away.

00:08:20.047 --> 00:08:22.601
Come back, look for the peanut, go away.

00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:25.463
They do this maybe half a dozen times
before they get bored,

00:08:25.487 --> 00:08:27.464
and then they go off and play in traffic.

00:08:27.488 --> 00:08:31.136
Crows, on the other hand,
show up and they try and figure it out.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.465
They know this machine
has been messing with them

00:08:33.489 --> 00:08:35.511
through three different
stages of behavior.

00:08:35.535 --> 00:08:36.537
(Laughter)

00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:38.340
They figure there must be more to it.

00:08:38.364 --> 00:08:40.173
So they poke at it and peck at it.

00:08:40.197 --> 00:08:42.351
And eventually some crow
gets a bright idea:

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:46.296
"Hey, there's lots of coins
lying around from the first stage,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.485
hops down, picks it up, drops it
in the slot, and we're off to the races.

00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:52.929
That crow enjoys a temporary
monopoly on peanuts,

00:08:52.953 --> 00:08:56.596
until his friends figure out
how to do it, and then there we go.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.976
So, what's significant about this to me

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.334
isn't that we can train crows
to pick up peanuts.

00:09:01.358 --> 00:09:05.188
Mind you, there's 216 million
dollars' worth of change lost every year,

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.867
but I'm not sure I can depend
on that ROI from crows.

00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:08.938
(Laughter)

00:09:08.962 --> 00:09:12.146
Instead, I think we should look
a little bit larger.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.436
I think crows can be trained
to do other things.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.936
For example, why not train them
to pick up garbage after stadium events?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.864
Or find expensive components
from discarded electronics?

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:22.773
Or maybe do search and rescue?

00:09:23.349 --> 00:09:25.976
The main point of all this for me is,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.729
we can find mutually beneficial
systems for these species.

00:09:28.753 --> 00:09:31.257
We can find ways to interact
with these other species

00:09:31.281 --> 00:09:33.215
that doesn't involve exterminating them,

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.541
but involves finding an equilibrium
with them that's a useful balance.

00:09:36.565 --> 00:09:37.820
Thanks very much.

00:09:37.844 --> 00:09:43.444
(Applause)
