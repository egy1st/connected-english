WEBVTT

00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:03.476
I want to start by doing an experiment.

00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:08.307
I'm going to play three videos
of a rainy day.

00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:12.819
But I've replaced the audio
of one of the videos,

00:00:12.843 --> 00:00:15.217
and instead of the sound of rain,

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.309
I've added the sound of bacon frying.

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:23.109
So I want you think carefully
which one the clip with the bacon is.

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:25.607
(Rain falls)

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.300
(Rain falls)

00:00:31.627 --> 00:00:33.532
(Rain falls)

00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:41.893
All right.

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:45.638
Actually, I lied.

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:46.932
They're all bacon.

00:00:46.956 --> 00:00:48.531
(Bacon sizzles)

00:00:52.276 --> 00:00:54.303
(Applause)

00:00:57.216 --> 00:01:00.489
My point here isn't really
to make you hungry

00:01:00.513 --> 00:01:02.162
every time you see a rainy scene,

00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:08.106
but it's to show that our brains
are conditioned to embrace the lies.

00:01:08.696 --> 00:01:10.794
We're not looking for accuracy.

00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:14.539
So on the subject of deception,

00:01:14.563 --> 00:01:17.926
I wanted to quote one
of my favorite authors.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.899
In "The Decay of Lying,"
Oscar Wilde establishes the idea

00:01:24.923 --> 00:01:30.532
that all bad art comes from copying
nature and being realistic;

00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:36.340
and all great art comes
from lying and deceiving,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.063
and telling beautiful, untrue things.

00:01:40.087 --> 00:01:44.001
So when you're watching a movie

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.402
and a phone rings,

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:48.428
it's not actually ringing.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:53.196
It's been added later
in postproduction in a studio.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.074
All of the sounds you hear are fake.

00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:57.908
Everything, apart from the dialogue,

00:01:57.932 --> 00:01:59.086
is fake.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.770
When you watch a movie and you see
a bird flapping its wings --

00:02:02.794 --> 00:02:04.815
(Wings flap)

00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:08.404
They haven't really recorded the bird.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:13.422
It sounds a lot more realistic
if you record a sheet

00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:14.998
or shaking kitchen gloves.

00:02:15.022 --> 00:02:17.374
(Flaps)

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.792
The burning of a cigarette up close --

00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:23.813
(Cigarette burns)

00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:28.102
It actually sounds a lot more authentic

00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:30.971
if you take a small Saran Wrap ball

00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:32.213
and release it.

00:02:32.237 --> 00:02:35.380
(A Saran Warp ball being released)

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:37.272
Punches?

00:02:37.296 --> 00:02:38.818
(Punch)

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:40.774
Oops, let me play that again.

00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:41.997
(Punch)

00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:46.271
That's often done by sticking
a knife in vegetables,

00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:47.717
usually cabbage.

00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:50.113
(Cabbage stabbed with a knife)

00:02:50.788 --> 00:02:53.752
The next one -- it's breaking bones.

00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:56.001
(Bones break)

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.004
Well, no one was really harmed.

00:02:59.028 --> 00:03:00.428
It's actually ...

00:03:01.163 --> 00:03:04.418
breaking celery or frozen lettuce.

00:03:04.442 --> 00:03:06.483
(Breaking frozen lettuce or celery)

00:03:06.947 --> 00:03:08.179
(Laughter)

00:03:09.253 --> 00:03:13.968
Making the right sounds
is not always as easy

00:03:13.992 --> 00:03:15.899
as a trip to the supermarket

00:03:15.923 --> 00:03:18.619
and going to the vegetable section.

00:03:18.643 --> 00:03:21.018
But it's often a lot more
complicated than that.

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:24.065
So let's reverse-engineer together

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:26.413
the creation of a sound effect.

00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:29.786
One of my favorite stories
comes from Frank Serafine.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.661
He's a contributor to our library,

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:35.247
and a great sound designer for "Tron"
and "Star Trek" and others.

00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:41.549
He was part of the Paramount team
that won the Oscar for best sound

00:03:41.573 --> 00:03:43.504
for "The Hunt for Red October."

00:03:43.528 --> 00:03:46.918
In this Cold War classic, in the '90s,

00:03:46.942 --> 00:03:51.727
they were asked to produce the sound
of the propeller of the submarine.

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:53.096
So they had a small problem:

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.640
they couldn't really find
a submarine in West Hollywood.

00:03:56.664 --> 00:04:00.322
So basically, what they did is,

00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:03.701
they went to a friend's swimming pool,

00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:08.260
and Frank performed
a cannonball, or bomba.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.265
They placed an underwater mic

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.065
and an overhead mic
outside the swimming pool.

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.342
So here's what the underwater
mic sounds like.

00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:18.901
(Underwater plunge)

00:04:19.608 --> 00:04:21.114
Adding the overhead mic,

00:04:21.138 --> 00:04:23.091
it sounded a bit like this:

00:04:23.115 --> 00:04:25.490
(Water splashes)

00:04:25.514 --> 00:04:29.961
So now they took the sound
and pitched it one octave down,

00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:32.461
sort of like slowing down a record.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.266
(Water splashes at lower octave)

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:38.697
And then they removed
a lot of the high frequencies.

00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:40.996
(Water splashes)

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.076
And pitched it down another octave.

00:04:44.314 --> 00:04:46.602
(Water splashes at lower octave)

00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:49.132
And then they added
a little bit of the splash

00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:51.440
from the overhead microphone.

00:04:51.464 --> 00:04:54.629
(Water splashes)

00:04:54.653 --> 00:04:57.191
And by looping and repeating that sound,

00:04:57.215 --> 00:04:58.405
they got this:

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:01.270
(Propeller churns)

00:05:04.463 --> 00:05:10.991
So, creativity and technology put together
in order to create the illusion

00:05:11.015 --> 00:05:14.186
that we're inside the submarine.

00:05:14.868 --> 00:05:18.229
But once you've created your sounds

00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:20.647
and you've synced them to the image,

00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:24.722
you want those sounds to live
in the world of the story.

00:05:25.397 --> 00:05:29.431
And one the best ways to do
that is to add reverb.

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.612
So this is the first audio tool
I want to talk about.

00:05:33.198 --> 00:05:38.320
Reverberation, or reverb,
is the persistence of the sound

00:05:38.344 --> 00:05:40.275
after the original sound has ended.

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:42.867
So it's sort of like the --

00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:45.927
all the reflections from the materials,

00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:48.838
the objects and the walls
around the sound.

00:05:48.862 --> 00:05:51.074
Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot.

00:05:51.098 --> 00:05:54.100
The original sound is less
than half a second long.

00:05:56.138 --> 00:05:57.288
(Gunshot)

00:05:57.747 --> 00:05:59.436
By adding reverb,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.677
we can make it sound like
it was recorded inside a bathroom.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.033
(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom)

00:06:05.057 --> 00:06:08.562
Or like it was recorded
inside a chapel or a church.

00:06:08.887 --> 00:06:10.440
(Gunshot reverbs church)

00:06:11.043 --> 00:06:13.047
Or in a canyon.

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.960
(Gunshot reverbs in canyon)

00:06:15.984 --> 00:06:18.637
So reverb gives us a lot of information

00:06:18.661 --> 00:06:23.591
about the space between the listener
and the original sound source.

00:06:23.615 --> 00:06:25.724
If the sound is the taste,

00:06:25.748 --> 00:06:29.932
then reverb is sort of like
the smell of the sound.

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:32.467
But reverb can do a lot more.

00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:36.401
Listening to a sound
with a lot less reverberation

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:38.508
than the on-screen action

00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:41.552
is going to immediately signify to us

00:06:41.576 --> 00:06:44.219
that we're listening to a commentator,

00:06:44.243 --> 00:06:49.034
to an objective narrator that's not
participating in the on-screen action.

00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:54.662
Also, emotionally intimate
moments in cinema

00:06:54.686 --> 00:06:56.633
are often heard with zero reverb,

00:06:56.657 --> 00:07:00.627
because that's how it would sound
if someone was speaking inside our ear.

00:07:01.024 --> 00:07:02.985
On the completely other side,

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.505
adding a lot of reverb to a voice

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:08.906
is going to make us think
that we're listening to a flashback,

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.946
or perhaps that we're inside
the head of a character

00:07:13.946 --> 00:07:16.422
or that we're listening
to the voice of God.

00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:18.708
Or, even more powerful in film,

00:07:18.732 --> 00:07:20.219
Morgan Freeman.

00:07:20.243 --> 00:07:21.527
(Laughter)

00:07:21.551 --> 00:07:22.718
So --

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:24.972
(Applause)

00:07:25.502 --> 00:07:29.373
But what are some other tools or hacks

00:07:29.397 --> 00:07:31.257
that sound designers use?

00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:34.489
Well, here's a really big one.

00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:41.198
It's silence.

00:07:41.807 --> 00:07:45.411
A few moments of silence
is going to make us pay attention.

00:07:45.881 --> 00:07:48.321
And in the Western world,

00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:50.468
we're not really used to verbal silences.

00:07:50.492 --> 00:07:53.521
They're considered awkward or rude.

00:07:54.537 --> 00:07:58.110
So silence preceding verbal communication

00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:01.081
can create a lot of tension.

00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:04.810
But imagine a really big Hollywood movie,

00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:09.178
where it's full of explosions
and automatic guns.

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:13.984
Loud stops being loud
anymore, after a while.

00:08:14.008 --> 00:08:15.952
So in a yin-yang way,

00:08:15.976 --> 00:08:19.113
silence needs loudness
and loudness needs silence

00:08:19.137 --> 00:08:21.535
for either of them to have any effect.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.727
But what does silence mean?

00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:26.689
Well, it depends how
it's used in each film.

00:08:27.416 --> 00:08:30.595
Silence can place us inside
the head of a character

00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:32.237
or provoke thought.

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.314
We often relate silences with ...

00:08:36.654 --> 00:08:37.972
contemplation,

00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:39.815
meditation,

00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:42.752
being deep in thought.

00:08:44.569 --> 00:08:47.671
But apart from having one meaning,

00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:49.865
silence becomes a blank canvas

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:54.414
upon which the viewer is invited
to the paint their own thoughts.

00:08:54.962 --> 00:08:58.638
But I want to make it clear:
there is no such thing as silence.

00:08:59.192 --> 00:09:03.637
And I know this sounds like the most
pretentious TED Talk statement ever.

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:10.140
But even if you were to enter
a room with zero reverberation

00:09:10.164 --> 00:09:12.229
and zero external sounds,

00:09:12.253 --> 00:09:15.370
you would still be able to hear
the pumping of your own blood.

00:09:16.004 --> 00:09:20.321
And in cinema, traditionally,
there was never a silent moment

00:09:20.345 --> 00:09:22.265
because of the sound of the projector.

00:09:22.716 --> 00:09:25.163
And even in today's Dolby world,

00:09:26.034 --> 00:09:29.315
there's not really any moment of silence
if you listen around you.

00:09:30.485 --> 00:09:32.710
There's always some sort of noise.

00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:35.661
Now, since there's no such
thing as silence,

00:09:35.685 --> 00:09:39.256
what do filmmakers
and sound designers use?

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.776
Well, as a synonym,
they often use ambiences.

00:09:44.307 --> 00:09:48.176
Ambiences are the unique background sounds

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.248
that are specific to each location.

00:09:51.272 --> 00:09:53.121
Each location has a unique sound,

00:09:53.145 --> 00:09:55.121
and each room has a unique sound,

00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:56.718
which is called room tone.

00:09:56.742 --> 00:09:59.165
So here's a recording
of a market in Morocco.

00:09:59.189 --> 00:10:02.129
(Voices, music)

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.238
And here's a recording
of Times Square in New York.

00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:13.366
(Traffic sounds, car horns, voices)

00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:19.071
Room tone is the addition of all
the noises inside the room:

00:10:19.095 --> 00:10:21.484
the ventilation, the heating, the fridge.

00:10:21.508 --> 00:10:24.419
Here's a recording
of my apartment in Brooklyn.

00:10:24.443 --> 00:10:29.321
(You can hear the ventilation, the boiler,
the fridge and street traffic)

00:10:35.422 --> 00:10:39.726
Ambiences work in a most primal way.

00:10:40.718 --> 00:10:43.572
They can speak directly
to our brain subconsciously.

00:10:44.538 --> 00:10:50.387
So, birds chirping outside your window
may indicate normality,

00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:53.728
perhaps because, as a species,

00:10:53.752 --> 00:10:57.889
we've been used to that sound
every morning for millions of years.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.303
(Birds chirp)

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:09.480
On the other hand, industrial sounds
have been introduced to us

00:11:09.504 --> 00:11:10.995
a little more recently.

00:11:11.969 --> 00:11:14.027
Even though I really like
them personally --

00:11:14.051 --> 00:11:16.464
they've been used by one
of my heroes, David Lynch,

00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:18.423
and his sound designer, Alan Splet --

00:11:18.447 --> 00:11:21.009
industrial sounds often carry
negative connotations.

00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:23.787
(Machine noises)

00:11:28.092 --> 00:11:32.948
Now, sound effects can tap
into our emotional memory.

00:11:34.869 --> 00:11:37.226
Occasionally, they can be so significant

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.824
that they become a character in a movie.

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:45.174
The sound of thunder may indicate
divine intervention or anger.

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:49.338
(Thunder)

00:11:51.957 --> 00:11:55.932
Church bells can remind us
of the passing of time,

00:11:55.956 --> 00:11:57.861
or perhaps our own mortality.

00:11:59.827 --> 00:12:03.341
(Bells ring)

00:12:07.773 --> 00:12:12.263
And breaking of glass can
indicate the end of a relationship

00:12:12.287 --> 00:12:13.515
or a friendship.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.191
(Glass breaks)

00:12:16.788 --> 00:12:20.341
Scientists believe that dissonant sounds,

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:25.136
for example, brass or wind
instruments played very loud,

00:12:26.438 --> 00:12:30.882
may remind us of animal howls in nature

00:12:30.906 --> 00:12:34.033
and therefore create a sense
of irritation or fear.

00:12:34.506 --> 00:12:37.437
(Brass and wind instruments play)

00:12:40.714 --> 00:12:43.886
So now we've spoken
about on-screen sounds.

00:12:44.298 --> 00:12:48.931
But occasionally, the source
of a sound cannot be seen.

00:12:48.955 --> 00:12:51.479
That's what we call offscreen sounds,

00:12:51.503 --> 00:12:52.951
or "acousmatic."

00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:55.275
Acousmatic sounds --

00:12:55.887 --> 00:13:00.920
well, the term "acousmatic" comes
from Pythagoras in ancient Greece,

00:13:00.944 --> 00:13:04.535
who used to teach behind
a veil or curtain for years,

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:07.749
not revealing himself to his disciples.

00:13:07.773 --> 00:13:10.561
I think the mathematician
and philosopher thought that,

00:13:11.727 --> 00:13:12.878
in that way,

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:17.621
his students might focus
more on the voice,

00:13:17.645 --> 00:13:19.609
and his words and its meaning,

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:22.803
rather than the visual of him speaking.

00:13:22.827 --> 00:13:25.526
So sort of like the Wizard of Oz,

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:30.364
or "1984's" Big Brother,

00:13:30.388 --> 00:13:33.654
separating the voice from its source,

00:13:33.678 --> 00:13:35.569
separating cause and effect

00:13:36.379 --> 00:13:40.174
sort of creates a sense
of ubiquity or panopticism,

00:13:40.198 --> 00:13:42.278
and therefore, authority.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:46.217
There's a strong tradition
of acousmatic sound.

00:13:47.129 --> 00:13:53.739
Nuns in monasteries in Rome and Venice
used to sing in rooms

00:13:53.763 --> 00:13:57.622
up in galleries close to the ceiling,

00:13:57.646 --> 00:14:01.586
creating the illusion that we're listening
to angels up in the sky.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.080
Richard Wagner famously
created the hidden orchestra

00:14:06.104 --> 00:14:09.940
that was placed in a pit
between the stage and the audience.

00:14:09.964 --> 00:14:15.007
And one of my heroes, Aphex Twin,
famously hid in dark corners of clubs.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:20.163
I think what all these masters knew
is that by hiding the source,

00:14:20.187 --> 00:14:21.850
you create a sense of mystery.

00:14:21.874 --> 00:14:23.943
This has been seen
in cinema over and over,

00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:27.047
with Hitchcock,
and Ridley Scott in "Alien."

00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:29.463
Hearing a sound without knowing its source

00:14:29.487 --> 00:14:32.712
is going to create some sort of tension.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:40.144
Also, it can minimize certain visual
restrictions that directors have

00:14:40.168 --> 00:14:43.858
and can show something
that wasn't there during filming.

00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:45.967
And if all this sounds
a little theoretical,

00:14:45.991 --> 00:14:48.397
I wanted to play a little video.

00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:51.816
(Toy squeaks)

00:14:52.383 --> 00:14:55.034
(Typewriter)

00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:58.267
(Drums)

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:01.485
(Ping-pong)

00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:05.444
(Knives being sharpened)

00:15:05.786 --> 00:15:08.832
(Record scratches)

00:15:09.405 --> 00:15:10.591
(Saw cuts)

00:15:10.615 --> 00:15:12.072
(Woman screams)

00:15:12.663 --> 00:15:16.458
What I'm sort of trying
to demonstrate with these tools

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.119
is that sound is a language.

00:15:20.516 --> 00:15:23.658
It can trick us by transporting
us geographically;

00:15:24.571 --> 00:15:26.087
it can change the mood;

00:15:26.579 --> 00:15:28.000
it can set the pace;

00:15:29.482 --> 00:15:32.936
it can make us laugh
or it can make us scared.

00:15:34.698 --> 00:15:38.048
On a personal level, I fell
in love with that language

00:15:38.072 --> 00:15:39.389
a few years ago,

00:15:39.413 --> 00:15:44.020
and somehow managed to make it
into some sort of profession.

00:15:45.274 --> 00:15:48.500
And I think with our work
through the sound library,

00:15:48.524 --> 00:15:54.320
we're trying to kind of expand
the vocabulary of that language.

00:15:55.797 --> 00:15:59.279
And in that way, we want
to offer the right tools

00:15:59.303 --> 00:16:00.943
to sound designers,

00:16:00.967 --> 00:16:02.315
filmmakers,

00:16:02.339 --> 00:16:04.174
and video game and app designers,

00:16:04.748 --> 00:16:07.883
to keep telling even better stories

00:16:08.382 --> 00:16:11.114
and creating even more beautiful lies.

00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:12.425
So thanks for listening.

00:16:12.449 --> 00:16:15.968
(Applause)
