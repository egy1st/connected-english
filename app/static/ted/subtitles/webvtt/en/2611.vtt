00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.720
(Music)

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.776
I went down

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.120
to St. James Infirmary

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.400
To see my baby there

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.080
She was lying on a long wooden table

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.440
So cold, so still, so fair

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.400
I went up to see the doctor

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.000
"She's very low," he said

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.760
I went back to see my baby

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.295
Good God

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.840
she's lying there dead

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.400
I went down to old Joe's bar room

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.800
On the corner of the square

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.016
They were serving drinks as per usual

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.800
And the usual crowd was there

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.040
To my left stood Old Joe McKennedy

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.880
His eyes were bloodshot red

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.880
He turned to the crowd around him

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.600
And these are the words he said

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.520
"Let her go, let her go, God bless her

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.160
Wherever she may be

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.080
She can search
this whole wide world all over

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.760
But she'll never find another man like me

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.416
She can search
this whole wide world all over

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.360
And she'll never find

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.959
another man

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.320
like me

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.400
When I die, please God, bury me

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.640
In my ten-dollar Stetson hat

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.696
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece
on my watch chain

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.040
So my friends know I died standing pat

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.120
Get six gamblers to carry my coffin

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.336
And six choir girls to sing me a song

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.696
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.080
To raise hell as I go along

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:27.520
Now that's the end of my story

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.200
Let's have another round of booze

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.600
And if anyone should ask you

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.096
Just tell them I got

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.240
the St. James Infirmary

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.760
blues

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.800
(Applause)
