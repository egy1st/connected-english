00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.496
I'm here today to talk to you
about a very powerful little word,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.055
one that people will do almost anything

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.360
to avoid becoming.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.536
Billion-dollar industries thrive

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.336
because of the fear of it,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.536
and those of us who undeniably are it

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.896
are left to navigate a relentless storm

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.120
surrounding it.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.856
I'm not sure if any of you have noticed,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.240
but I'm fat.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.576
Not the lowercase,
muttered-behind-my-back kind,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.976
or the seemingly harmless
chubby or cuddly.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.600
I'm not even the more sophisticated
voluptuous or curvaceous kind.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.696
Let's not sugarcoat it.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.576
I am the capital F-A-T kind of fat.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.200
I am the elephant in the room.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.576
When I walked out on stage,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.296
some of you may have been thinking,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.736
"Aww, this is going to be hilarious,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.376
because everybody knows
that fat people are funny."

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.416
(Laughter)

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.575
Or you may have been thinking,
"Where does she get her confidence from?"

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.920
Because a confident fat woman
is almost unthinkable.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.016
The fashion-conscious
members of the audience

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.696
may have been thinking how fabulous I look

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.296
in this Beth Ditto dress --

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.536
(Cheers)

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.456
thank you very much.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.376
Whereas some of you might have thought,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.056
"Hmm, black would have been
so much more slimming."

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.336
(Laughter)

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.856
You may have wondered, consciously or not,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.816
if I have diabetes, or a partner,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.056
or if I eat carbs after 7pm.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.336
(Laughter)

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.296
You may have worried
that you ate carbs after 7pm last night,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.040
and that you really should renew
your gym membership.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.576
These judgments are insidious.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.176
They can be directed
at individuals and groups,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.760
and they can also
be directed at ourselves.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.560
And this way of thinking
is known as fatphobia.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.216
Like any form of systematic oppression,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.896
fatphobia is deeply rooted
in complex structures

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.976
like capitalism, patriarchy and racism,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.776
and that can make it
really difficult to see,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.080
let alone challenge.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.256
We live in a culture

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.256
where being fat
is seen as being a bad person --

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.096
lazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.600
and morally suspect.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.016
And we tend to see thinness

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.240
as being universally good --

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.056
responsible, successful,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.440
and in control of our appetites,
bodies and lives.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.576
We see these ideas again and again

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.536
in the media, in public health policy,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.176
doctors' offices,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.376
in everyday conversations

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.080
and in our own attitudes.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.856
We may even blame fat people themselves

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.456
for the discrimination they face

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.176
because, after all, if we don't like it,
we should just lose weight.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.440
Easy.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.856
This antifat bias has become
so integral, so ingrained

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.416
to how we value ourselves and each other

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.176
that we rarely question why
we have such contempt for people of size

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.040
and where that disdain comes from.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.896
But we must question it,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.096
because the enormous value
we place on how we look

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.240
affects every one of us.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.536
And do we really want to live in a society

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.496
where people are denied
their basic humanity

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.480
if they don't subscribe
to some arbitrary form of acceptable?

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.936
So when I was six years old,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.496
my sister used to teach ballet
to a bunch of little girls in our garage.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.720
I was about a foot taller and a foot wider
than most of the group.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.536
When it came to doing
our first performance,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.176
I was so excited
about wearing a pretty pink tutu.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.720
I was going to sparkle.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.936
As the other girls slipped easily
into their Lycra and tulle creations,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.840
not one of the tutus
was big enough to fit me.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.856
I was determined not to be
excluded from the performance,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.696
so I turned to my mother

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.656
and loud enough for everyone to hear

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.296
said, "Mom, I don't need a tutu.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.496
I need a fourfour."

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.720
(Laughter)

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.976
Thanks, Mom.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.536
(Applause)

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.976
And although I didn't
recognize it at the time,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.256
claiming space for myself
in that glorious fourfour

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.160
was the first step towards becoming
a radical fat activist.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.696
Now, I'm not saying
that this whole body-love thing

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.976
has been an easy skip along
a glittering path of self-acceptance

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.896
since that day in class.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.120
Far from it.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.936
I soon learned that living outside
what the mainstream considers normal

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.800
can be a frustrating and isolating place.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.336
I've spent the last 20 years unpacking
and deprogramming these messages,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.080
and it's been quite the roller coaster.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.896
I've been openly laughed at,
abused from passing cars

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.560
and been told that I'm delusional.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.856
I also receive smiles from strangers

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.696
who recognize what it takes
to walk down the street

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.296
with a spring in your step
and your head held high.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.656
(Cheer)

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.016
Thanks.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.096
And through it all, that fierce
little six-year-old has stayed with me,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.976
and she has helped me
stand before you today

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.016
as an unapologetic fat person,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.136
a person that simply refuses to subscribe

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.576
to the dominant narrative

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.296
about how I should move
through the world in this body of mine.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.120
(Applause)

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.520
And I'm not alone.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.576
I am part of an international
community of people

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.216
who choose to, rather
than passively accepting

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.176
that our bodies are
and probably always will be big,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.520
we actively choose to flourish
in these bodies as they are today.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.056
People who honor our strength
and work with, not against,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.456
our perceived limitations,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.296
people who value health

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.776
as something much more holistic

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.976
than a number on an outdated BMI chart.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.096
Instead, we value mental health,
self-worth and how we feel in our bodies

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.600
as vital aspects
to our overall well-being.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.776
People who refuse to believe
that living in these fat bodies

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.640
is a barrier to anything, really.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.656
There are doctors, academics and bloggers

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.856
who have written countless volumes

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.040
on the many facets
of this complex subject.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.616
There are fatshionistas
who reclaim their bodies and their beauty

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.576
by wearing fatkinis and crop tops,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.520
exposing the flesh
that we're all taught to hide.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.776
There are fat athletes

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.776
who run marathons,
teach yoga or do kickboxing,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.560
all done with a middle finger
firmly held up to the status quo.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.056
And these people have taught me
that radical body politics

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.360
is the antidote
to our body-shaming culture.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.456
But to be clear, I'm not saying
that people shouldn't change their bodies

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.960
if that's what they want to do.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.576
Reclaiming yourself can be one
of the most gorgeous acts of self-love

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.200
and can look like
a million different things,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.696
from hairstyles to tattoos
to body contouring

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.800
to hormones to surgery
and yes, even weight loss.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.616
It's simple: it's your body,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.080
and you decide what's best to do with it.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.816
My way of engaging in activism

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.936
is by doing all the things
that we fatties aren't supposed to do,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.496
and there's a lot of them,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.720
inviting other people to join me
and then making art about it.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.776
The common thread
through most of this work

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.456
has been reclaiming spaces that are
often prohibitive to bigger bodies,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.416
from the catwalk to club shows,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.000
from public swimming pools
to prominent dance stages.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.416
And reclaiming spaces en masse
is not only a powerful artistic statement

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.000
but a radical community-building approach.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.936
This was so true of "AQUAPORKO!" --

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.896
(Laughter)

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.536
the fat fem synchronized swim team

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.000
I started with a group
of friends in Sydney.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.776
The impact of seeing
a bunch of defiant fat women

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.015
in flowery swimming caps and bathers

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.856
throwing their legs in the air
without a care

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.000
should not be underestimated.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.640
(Laughter)

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.016
Throughout my career, I have learned
that fat bodies are inherently political,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.136
and unapologetic fat bodies

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.040
can blow people's minds.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.736
When director Kate Champion,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.736
of acclaimed dance theater
company Force Majeure,

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.216
asked me to be the artistic associate

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.536
on a work featuring all fat dancers,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.680
I literally jumped at the opportunity.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.200
And I mean literally.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.896
"Nothing to Lose" is a work made
in collaboration with performers of size

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.496
who drew from their lived experiences

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.056
to create a work as varied
and authentic as we all are.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.320
And it was as far from ballet
as you could imagine.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.936
The very idea of a fat dance work
by such a prestigious company

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.056
was, to put it mildly, controversial,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.096
because nothing like it had ever been done
on mainstream dance stages before

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.960
anywhere in the world.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.960
People were skeptical.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.376
"What do you mean, 'fat dancers?'

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.800
Like, size 10, size 12 kind of fat?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.896
Where did they do their dance training?

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.480
Are they going to have the stamina
for a full-length production?"

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.696
But despite the skepticism,

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.816
"Nothing to Lose" became
a sellout hit of Sydney Festival.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.176
We received rave reviews, toured,

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.736
won awards and were written about
in over 27 languages.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.200
These incredible images of our cast
were seen worldwide.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.976
I've lost count of how many times
people of all sizes

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.096
have told me that the show
has changed their lives,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.136
how it helped them
shift their relationship

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.496
to their own and other people's bodies,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.280
and how it made them confront
their own bias.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.776
But of course, work
that pushes people's buttons

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.000
is not without its detractors.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.296
I have been told
that I'm glorifying obesity.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.816
I have received violent death threats

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.296
and abuse for daring to make work
that centers fat people's bodies and lives

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.840
and treats us as worthwhile human beings
with valuable stories to tell.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.616
I've even been called

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.576
"the ISIS of the obesity epidemic" --

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.296
(Laughter)

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.880
a comment so absurd that it is funny.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.776
But it also speaks to the panic,

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.776
the literal terror,

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.880
that the fear of fat can evoke.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.976
It is this fear that's feeding
the diet industry,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.776
which is keeping so many of us
from making peace with our own bodies,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.096
for waiting to be the after-photo

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.376
before we truly start to live our lives.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.200
Because the real elephant
in the room here is fatphobia.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.536
Fat activism refuses to indulge this fear.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.856
By advocating for self-determination
and respect for all of us,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.816
we can shift society's reluctance
to embrace diversity

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.840
and start to celebrate the myriad ways
there are to have a body.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.736
Thank you.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:07.156
(Applause)
