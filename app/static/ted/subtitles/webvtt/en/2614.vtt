00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.022
In the spring of 2016,

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:07.450
a legal battle between Apple
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.152
captured the world's attention.

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:12.972
Apple has built security features
into its mobile products

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:16.829
which protect data on its devices
from everyone but the owner.

00:00:16.853 --> 00:00:21.498
That means that criminals, hackers
and yes, even governments

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:22.842
are all locked out.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.779
For Apple's customers,
this is a great thing.

00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.620
But governments are not so happy.

00:00:29.152 --> 00:00:31.469
You see, Apple has made
a conscious decision

00:00:31.493 --> 00:00:34.053
to get out of the surveillance business.

00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:37.288
Apple has tried to make surveillance
as difficult as possible

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:39.678
for governments and any other actors.

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:44.006
There are really two
smartphone operating systems

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.658
in the global smartphone market:

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:47.396
iOS and Android.

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:50.817
iOS is made by Apple.
Android is made by Google.

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:54.570
Apple has spent a lot of time and money

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:57.865
to make sure that its products
are as secure as possible.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:01.892
Apple encrypts all data
stored on iPhones by default,

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:05.922
and text messages sent from one
Apple customer to another Apple customer

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:07.648
are encrypted by default

00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:10.189
without the user having
to take any actions.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:12.380
What this means is that,

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:16.184
if the police seize an iPhone
and it has a password,

00:01:16.724 --> 00:01:20.366
they'll have a difficult time
getting any data off of it,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.802
if they can do it at all.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:26.512
In contrast, the security of Android
just really isn't as good.

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:29.582
Android phones, or at least
most of the Android phones

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:31.212
that have been sold to consumers,

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:34.091
do not encrypt data stored
on the device by default,

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:39.101
and the built-in text messaging app
in Android does not use encryption.

00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:42.249
So if the police seize an Android phone,

00:01:42.273 --> 00:01:45.630
chances are, they'll be able to get
all the data they want

00:01:45.654 --> 00:01:46.946
off of that device.

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:49.544
Two smartphones

00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:51.901
from two of the biggest
companies in the world;

00:01:52.497 --> 00:01:54.282
one that protects data by default,

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.222
and one that doesn't.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.982
Apple is a seller of luxury goods.

00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:02.255
It dominates the high end of the market.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.064
And we would expect a manufacturer
of luxury goods to have products

00:02:07.088 --> 00:02:09.045
that include more features.

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:11.974
But not everyone can afford an iPhone.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.585
That's where Android
really, really dominates:

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.360
at the middle and low end of the market,

00:02:17.384 --> 00:02:20.010
smartphones for the billion
and a half people

00:02:20.034 --> 00:02:22.904
who cannot or will not spend

00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:25.389
600 dollars on a phone.

00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:35.105
But the dominance of Android
has led to what I call

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.341
the "digital security divide."

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:40.350
That is, there is now increasingly a gap

00:02:40.374 --> 00:02:44.499
between the privacy
and security of the rich,

00:02:44.523 --> 00:02:47.293
who can afford devices
that secure their data by default,

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:49.288
and of the poor,

00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:54.525
whose devices do very little
to protect them by default.

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:58.782
So, think of the average Apple customer:

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:04.875
a banker, a lawyer,
a doctor, a politician.

00:03:05.387 --> 00:03:10.641
These individuals now increasingly have
smartphones in their pockets

00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:14.138
that encrypt their calls,
their text messages,

00:03:14.162 --> 00:03:15.697
all the data on the device,

00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:19.729
without them doing really anything
to secure their information.

00:03:20.904 --> 00:03:24.949
In contrast, the poor
and the most vulnerable in our societies

00:03:24.973 --> 00:03:30.160
are using devices that leave them
completely vulnerable to surveillance.

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:33.054
In the United States, where I live,

00:03:33.078 --> 00:03:37.027
African-Americans are more likely
to be seen as suspicious

00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:38.902
or more likely to be profiled,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.305
and are more likely to be targeted
by the state with surveillance.

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:46.797
But African-Americans
are also disproportionately likely

00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:49.917
to use Android devices
that do nothing at all

00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:52.011
to protect them from that surveillance.

00:03:52.974 --> 00:03:54.298
This is a problem.

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:58.045
We must remember
that surveillance is a tool.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.458
It's a tool used by those in power

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:04.192
against those who have no power.

00:04:05.173 --> 00:04:09.923
And while I think it's absolutely great

00:04:09.947 --> 00:04:13.395
that companies like Apple
are making it easy for people to encrypt,

00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:18.170
if the only people
who can protect themselves

00:04:18.194 --> 00:04:19.685
from the gaze of the government

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.269
are the rich and powerful,

00:04:21.741 --> 00:04:22.928
that's a problem.

00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:27.111
And it's not just a privacy
or a cybersecurity problem.

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:29.283
It's a civil rights problem.

00:04:30.806 --> 00:04:33.673
So the lack of default security in Android

00:04:33.697 --> 00:04:39.076
is not just a problem
for the poor and vulnerable users

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.318
who are depending on these devices.

00:04:41.342 --> 00:04:43.602
This is actually a problem
for our democracy.

00:04:44.237 --> 00:04:45.705
I'll explain what I mean.

00:04:46.514 --> 00:04:49.389
Modern social movements
rely on technology --

00:04:49.413 --> 00:04:54.836
from Black Lives Matter to the Arab Spring
to Occupy Wall Street.

00:04:55.238 --> 00:04:59.213
The organizers of these movements
and the members of these movements

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:03.177
increasingly communicate
and coordinate with smartphones.

00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:08.297
And so, naturally governments
that feel threatened by these movements

00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:11.977
will also target the organizers
and their smartphones.

00:05:13.462 --> 00:05:15.536
Now, it's quite possible

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.624
that a future Martin Luther King
or a Mandela or a Gandhi

00:05:19.648 --> 00:05:23.505
will have an iPhone and be protected
from government surveillance.

00:05:24.283 --> 00:05:25.830
But chances are,

00:05:25.854 --> 00:05:29.568
they'll probably have a cheap,
$20 Android phone in their pocket.

00:05:30.676 --> 00:05:34.497
And so if we do nothing
to address the digital security divide,

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:38.389
if we do nothing to ensure
that everyone in our society

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:41.452
gets the same benefits of encryption

00:05:41.476 --> 00:05:45.133
and is equally able to protect themselves
from surveillance by the state,

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:49.939
not only will the poor and vulnerable
be exposed to surveillance,

00:05:50.404 --> 00:05:53.345
but future civil rights
movements may be crushed

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:55.789
before they ever reach
their full potential.

00:05:55.813 --> 00:05:56.980
Thank you.

00:05:57.004 --> 00:06:00.111
(Applause)

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.866
Helen Walters: Chris, thank you so much.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.762
I have a question for you.

00:06:07.786 --> 00:06:09.639
We saw recently in the press

00:06:09.663 --> 00:06:15.167
that Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook
covers over his camera

00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:18.165
and does something
with his headphone mic jack.

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.734
So I wanted to ask you
a personal question, which is:

00:06:20.758 --> 00:06:21.910
Do you do that?

00:06:21.934 --> 00:06:24.513
And, on behalf of everyone
here, particularly myself,

00:06:24.537 --> 00:06:25.862
Should we be doing that?

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:27.654
Should we be covering these things?

00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:31.839
Christopher Soghoian: Putting a sticker --
actually, I like Band-Aids,

00:06:31.863 --> 00:06:34.128
because you can remove them
and put them back on

00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:36.464
whenever you want to make
a call or a Skype call.

00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:38.190
Putting a sticker over your web cam

00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:40.890
is probably the best thing
you can do for your privacy

00:06:40.914 --> 00:06:42.420
in terms of bang for buck.

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:46.341
There really is malware,
malicious software out there

00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:48.222
that can take over your web cam,

00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:50.116
even without the light turning on.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.309
This is used by criminals.
This is used by stalkers.

00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:58.271
You can buy $19.99 "spy
on your ex-girlfriend" software online.

00:06:58.295 --> 00:06:59.446
It's really terrifying.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.994
And then, of course,
it's used by governments.

00:07:02.018 --> 00:07:05.239
And there's obviously
a sexual violence component to this,

00:07:05.263 --> 00:07:08.964
which is that this kind of surveillance
can be used most effectively

00:07:08.988 --> 00:07:15.791
against women and other people
who can be shamed in our society.

00:07:16.417 --> 00:07:18.525
Even if you think
you have nothing to hide,

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:23.107
at the very least, if you have
children, teenagers in your lives,

00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:26.141
make sure you put a sticker
on their camera and protect them.

00:07:26.165 --> 00:07:28.159
HW: Wow. Thank you so much.
CS: Thank you.

00:07:28.183 --> 00:07:29.334
HW: Thanks, Chris.

00:07:29.358 --> 00:07:31.830
(Applause)
