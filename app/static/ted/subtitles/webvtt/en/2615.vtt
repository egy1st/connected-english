00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.656
For over a decade,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.736
I have studied young people
that have been pushed out of school,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.680
so called "dropouts."

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.776
As they end up failed
by the education system,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.336
they're on the streets
where they're vulnerable to violence,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.816
police harassment,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.296
police brutality

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.960
and incarceration.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.776
I follow these young people
for years at a time,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.216
across institutional settings,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.400
to try to understand what some of us call
the "school-to-prison pipeline."

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.696
When you look at a picture like this,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.280
of young people who are in my study ...

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.856
you might see trouble.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.056
I mean one of the boys
has a bottle of liquor in his hand,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.216
he's 14 years old

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.760
and it's a school day.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.936
Other people, when they see this picture,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.976
might see gangs,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.096
thugs, delinquents --

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.320
criminals.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.320
But I see it different.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.496
I see these young people
through a perspective

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.840
that looks at the assets
that they bring to the education system.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.336
So will you join me in changing
the way we label young people

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.000
from "at-risk" to "at-promise?"

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.520
(Applause)

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.616
How do I know that these young people

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.096
have the potential
and the promise to change?

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.160
I know this because I am one of them.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.016
You see, I grew up
in dire poverty in the inner city,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.256
without a father --

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.360
he abandoned me before I was even born.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.096
We were on welfare,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.416
sometimes homeless,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.920
many times hungry.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.016
By the time I was 15 years old,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.320
I had been incarcerated in juvy
three times for three felonies.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.480
My best friend had already been killed.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.256
And soon after,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.816
while I'm standing next to my uncle,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.039
he gets shot.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.056
And as I'm waiting
for the ambulance to arrive

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.840
for over an hour ...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.680
he bleeds to death on the street.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.400
I had lost faith and hope in the world,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.496
and I had given up on the system
because the system had failed me.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.616
I had nothing to offer

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.200
and no one had anything to offer me.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.736
I was fatalistic.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.760
I didn't even think
I could make it to my 18th birthday.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.656
The reason I'm here today

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.176
is because a teacher
that cared reached out

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.840
and managed to tap into my soul.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.376
This teacher,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.600
Ms. Russ ...

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.216
she was the kind of teacher
that was always in your business.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.976
(Laughter)

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.456
She was the kind of teacher that was like,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.616
"Victor, I'm here for you
whenever you're ready."

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.840
(Laughter)

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.536
I wasn't ready.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.200
But she understood one basic principle
about young people like me.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.120
We're like oysters.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.496
We're only going to open up
when we're ready,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.000
and if you're not there when we're ready,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.294
we're going to clam back up.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.096
Ms. Russ was there for me.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.136
She was culturally relevant,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.296
she respected my community,
my people, my family.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.640
I told her a story about my Uncle Ruben.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.896
He would take me to work with him
because I was broke,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.776
and he knew I needed some money.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.480
He collected glass bottles for a living.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.376
Four in the morning on a school day,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.000
we'd throw the glass bottles
in the back of his van,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.120
and the bottles would break.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.816
And my hands and arms would start to bleed

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.520
and my tennis shoes and pants
would get all bloody.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.400
And I was terrified and in pain,
and I would stop working.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.176
And my uncle, he would look me in the eyes
and he would say to me,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.536
"Mijo,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.240
estamos buscando vida."

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.576
"We're searching for a better life,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.600
we're trying to make
something out of nothing."

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.696
Ms. Russ listened to my story,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.216
welcomed it into the classroom and said,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.280
"Victor, this is your power.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.240
This is your potential.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.136
Your family, your culture, your community
have taught you a hard-work ethic

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.496
and you will use it to empower
yourself in the academic world

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.240
so you can come back
and empower your community."

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.416
With Ms. Russ's help,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.320
I ended up returning to school.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.040
I even finished my credits on time

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.720
and graduated with my class.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.200
(Applause)

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.416
But Ms. Russ said to me
right before graduation,

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.760
"Victor, I'm so proud of you.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.696
I knew you could do it.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.936
Now it's time to go to college."

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.160
(Laughter)

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.536
College, me?

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.600
Man, what is this teacher smoking
thinking I'm going to college?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.120
I applied with the mentors
and support she provided,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.016
got a letter of acceptance,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.256
and one of the paragraphs read,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.640
"You've been admitted
under probationary status."

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.896
I said, "Probation?
I'm already on probation,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.136
that don't matter?"

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.416
(Laughter)

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.320
It was academic probation,
not criminal probation.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.136
But what do teachers like Ms. Russ
do to succeed with young people

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.056
like the ones I study?

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.256
I propose three strategies.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.496
The first:

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.696
let's get rid of our
deficit perspective in education.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.976
"These people
come from a culture of violence,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.256
a culture of poverty.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.856
These people are at-risk;
these people are truant.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.760
These people are empty containers
for us to fill with knowledge.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.696
They have the problems,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.800
we have the solutions."

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.400
Number two.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.760
Let's value the stories that young people
bring to the schoolhouse.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.056
Their stories of overcoming
insurmountable odds are so powerful.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.760
And I know you know some of these stories.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.096
These very same stories and experiences

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.760
already have grit, character
and resilience in them.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.816
So let's help young people
refine those stories.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.816
Let's help them be proud of who they are,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.776
because our education system
welcomes their families, their cultures,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.016
their communities

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.840
and the skill set
they've learned to survive.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.816
And of course the third strategy
being the most important:

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.056
resources.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.920
We have to provide
adequate resources to young people.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.800
Grit alone isn't going to cut it.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.256
You can sit there
and tell me all you want,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.416
"Hey man, pick yourself up
by the bootstraps."

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.496
But if I was born
without any straps on my boots --

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.736
(Laughter)

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.496
How am I supposed to pick myself up?

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.360
(Applause)

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.736
Job training,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.976
mentoring,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.696
counseling ...

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.456
Teaching young people
to learn from their mistakes

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.176
instead of criminalizing them,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.720
and dragging them out
of their classrooms like animals.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.616
How about this?

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.376
I propose that we implement restorative
justice in every high school in America.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.080
(Applause)

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.056
So we went out to test these ideas
in the community of Watts in LA

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.336
with 40 young people
that had been pushed out of school.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.040
William was one of them.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.896
William was the kind of kid
that had been given every label.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.136
He had dropped out, he was a gang member,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.400
a criminal.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.776
And when we met him he was very resistant.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.216
But I remember what Ms. Russ used to say.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.536
"Hey, I'm here for you
whenever you're ready."

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.015
(Laughter)

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.320
So over time --

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.696
over time he began to open up.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.159
And I remember the day
that he made the switch.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.616
We were in a large group

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.736
and a young lady in our program was crying

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.440
because she told us her powerful story

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.696
of her dad being killed

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.720
and then his body being shown
in the newspaper the next day.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.176
And as she's crying,
I don't know what to do,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.936
so I give her her space,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.200
and William had enough.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.616
He slammed his hands
on the desk and he said,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.120
"Hey, everybody! Group hug! Group hug!"

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.280
(Applause)

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:29.176
This young lady's tears and pain
turned into joy and laughter

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.776
knowing that her community had her back,

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.576
and William had now learned
that he did have a purpose in life:

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.560
to help to heal the souls
of people in his own community.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.176
He told us his story.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.976
We refined his story

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.816
to go from being the story of a victim
to being the story of a survivor

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.216
that has overcome adversity.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.160
We placed high value on it.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.160
William went on to finish high school,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.096
get his security guard certificate
to become a security guard,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.976
and is now working
at a local school district.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.920
(Applause)

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.336
Ms. Russ's mantra --

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.616
her mantra was always,

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.040
"when you teach to the heart,
the mind will follow."

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.520
The great writer Khalil Gibran says,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.640
"Out of suffering
have emerged the greatest souls.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.360
The massive characters
are seared with scars."

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.696
I believe that in this education
revolution that we're talking about

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.656
we need to invite the souls
of the young people that we work with,

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.936
and once they're able to refine --

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.016
identify their grit,
resilience and character

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.880
that they've already developed --

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.120
their academic performance will improve.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.696
Let's believe in young people.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.016
Let's provide them
the right kinds of resources.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.696
I'll tell you what my teacher did for me.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.200
She believed in me so much

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.216
that she tricked me
into believing in myself.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.456
Thank you.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.040
(Applause)
