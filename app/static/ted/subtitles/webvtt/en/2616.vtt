00:00:00.826 --> 00:00:03.404
I want to talk to you about my kids.

00:00:03.743 --> 00:00:08.391
Now, I know everyone thinks
that their kid is the most fantastic,

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:10.490
the most beautiful kid that ever lived.

00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:12.601
But mine really are.

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:13.932
(Laughter)

00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:16.330
I have 696 kids,

00:00:16.354 --> 00:00:20.806
and they are the most intelligent,
inventive, innovative,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.676
brilliant and powerful kids
that you'll ever meet.

00:00:25.263 --> 00:00:30.086
Any student I've had the honor of teaching
in my classroom is my kid.

00:00:30.702 --> 00:00:34.521
However, because their "real"
parents aren't rich

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:37.421
and, I argue, because they
are mostly of color,

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:39.951
they will seldom get to see in themselves

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.391
the awesomeness that I see in them.

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:45.353
Because what I see in them is myself --

00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:48.336
or what would have been myself.

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:52.038
I am the daughter of two hardworking,

00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:54.680
college-educated, African-American parents

00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:57.418
who chose careers as public servants:

00:00:57.442 --> 00:01:01.054
my father, a minister;
my mother, an educator.

00:01:01.078 --> 00:01:04.614
Wealth was never the primary
ambition in our house.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.737
Because of this lack of wealth,

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:08.971
we lived in a neighborhood
that lacked wealth,

00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:11.838
and henceforth a school system
that lacked wealth.

00:01:12.307 --> 00:01:16.147
Luckily, however, we struck
the educational jackpot

00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:18.542
in a voluntary desegregation program

00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.934
that buses inner-city kids --
black and brown --

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.612
out to suburban schools -- rich and white.

00:01:25.288 --> 00:01:29.049
At five years old, I had to take
an hour-long bus ride

00:01:29.073 --> 00:01:31.134
to a faraway place

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:32.955
to get a better education.

00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:38.136
At five years old, I thought
everyone had a life just like mine.

00:01:38.621 --> 00:01:40.651
I thought everyone went to school

00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:43.034
and were the only ones
using the brown crayons

00:01:43.058 --> 00:01:44.726
to color in their family portraits,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.831
while everyone else was using
the peach-colored ones.

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:52.174
At five years old, I thought
everyone was just like me.

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:56.111
But as I got older, I started
noticing things, like:

00:01:56.948 --> 00:01:59.510
How come my neighborhood friend
don't have to wake up

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:01.072
at five o'clock in the morning,

00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:03.607
and go to a school that's an hour away?

00:02:04.278 --> 00:02:06.528
How come I'm learning to play the violin

00:02:06.552 --> 00:02:10.260
while my neighborhood friends
don't even have a music class?

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.584
Why were my neighborhood friends
learning and reading material

00:02:14.608 --> 00:02:17.036
that I had done two to three years prior?

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:19.980
See, as I got older,

00:02:20.762 --> 00:02:24.691
I started to have
this unlawful feeling in my belly,

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:28.623
like I was doing something
that I wasn't supposed to be doing;

00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:31.358
taking something that wasn't mine;

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.109
receiving a gift,

00:02:33.544 --> 00:02:35.571
but with someone else's name on it.

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.433
All these amazing things
that I was being exposed to

00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:41.155
and experiencing,

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.454
I felt I wasn't really supposed to have.

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.216
I wasn't supposed to have a library,
fully equipped athletic facilities,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.712
or safe fields to play in.

00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:54.455
I wasn't supposed to have
theatre departments

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.844
with seasonal plays and concerts --

00:02:56.868 --> 00:02:59.105
digital, visual, performing arts.

00:02:59.603 --> 00:03:04.259
I wasn't supposed to have
fully resourced biology or chemistry labs,

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:07.085
school buses that brought me door-to-door,

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.537
freshly prepared school lunches

00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:11.305
or even air conditioning.

00:03:12.127 --> 00:03:14.057
These are things my kids don't get.

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.198
You see, as I got older,

00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:19.239
while I was grateful
for this amazing opportunity

00:03:19.263 --> 00:03:20.909
that I was being given,

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:23.661
there was this ever-present pang of:

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.629
But what about everyone else?

00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:30.507
There are thousands
of other kids just like me,

00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:32.267
who deserve this, too.

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.429
Why doesn't everyone get this?

00:03:34.453 --> 00:03:38.793
Why is a high-quality education
only exclusive to the rich?

00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:43.198
It was like I had some sort
of survivor's remorse.

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:45.954
All of my neighborhood friends
were experiencing

00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:47.803
an educational train wreck

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:51.516
that I was saved from through a bus ride.

00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:54.561
I was like an educational Moses screaming,

00:03:54.585 --> 00:03:56.194
"Let my people go ...

00:03:56.218 --> 00:03:58.055
to high-quality schools!"

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.496
(Laughter)

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.080
I'd seen firsthand how the other half
was being treated and educated.

00:04:04.104 --> 00:04:07.043
I'd seen the educational promised land,

00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:11.306
and I could not for the life of me
justify the disparity.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.292
I now teach in the very same school system
from which I sought refuge.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.407
I know firsthand the tools
that were given to me as a student,

00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:27.354
and now as a teacher, I don't have
access to those same tools

00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:28.942
to give my students.

00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:34.026
There have been countless nights
when I've cried in frustration,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.326
anger

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.741
and sorrow,

00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:40.056
because I can't teach my kids
the way that I was taught,

00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:44.772
because I don't have access
to the same resources or tools

00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:46.686
that were used to teach me.

00:04:47.393 --> 00:04:49.564
My kids deserve so much better.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.133
We sit and we keep banging
our heads against this term:

00:04:53.157 --> 00:04:55.722
"Achievement gap, achievement gap!"

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:59.394
Is it really that hard to understand

00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:02.643
why these kids perform well
and these kids don't?

00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:04.092
I mean, really.

00:05:04.664 --> 00:05:06.931
I think we've got it all wrong.

00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:08.116
I think we,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.222
as Gloria Ladson-Billings says,

00:05:10.246 --> 00:05:14.988
should flip our paradigm and our language
and call it what it really is.

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:17.135
It's not an achievement gap;

00:05:17.878 --> 00:05:19.806
it's an education debt,

00:05:20.417 --> 00:05:25.695
for all of the foregone schooling
resources that were never invested

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:29.564
in the education of the black
and brown child over time.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.846
A little-known secret in American history

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.923
is that the only American institution
created specifically for people of color

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.280
is the American slave trade --

00:05:41.866 --> 00:05:43.815
and some would argue the prison system,

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.065
but that's another topic
for another TED Talk.

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.239
(Laughter)

00:05:47.654 --> 00:05:51.947
The public school system of this country
was built, bought and paid for

00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:56.258
using commerce generated
from the slave trade and slave labor.

00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:00.614
While African-Americans were enslaved
and prohibited from schooling,

00:06:00.638 --> 00:06:03.797
their labor established
the very institution

00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:05.509
from which they were excluded.

00:06:06.042 --> 00:06:11.121
Ever since then, every court case,
educational policy, reform,

00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:14.399
has been an attempt
to retrofit the design,

00:06:14.423 --> 00:06:17.083
rather than just stopping
and acknowledging:

00:06:17.107 --> 00:06:19.715
we've had it all wrong from the beginning.

00:06:21.243 --> 00:06:25.286
An oversimplification
of American educational history.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.822
All right, just bear with me.

00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:30.758
Blacks were kept out -- you know,
the whole slavery thing.

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:33.333
With the help
of philanthropic white people,

00:06:33.357 --> 00:06:34.911
they built their own schools.

00:06:34.935 --> 00:06:37.269
Separate but equal was OK.

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.459
But while we all know
things were indeed separate,

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.139
they were in no ways equal.

00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:47.736
Enter Brown v. the Board of Education
of Topeka, Kansas in 1954;

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.991
legal separation of the races
is now illegal.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.129
But very few people pay attention
to all of the court cases since then,

00:06:58.153 --> 00:07:03.426
that have undone the educational
promised land for every child

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.414
that Brown v. Board intended.

00:07:06.438 --> 00:07:10.156
Some argue that today our schools
are now more segregated

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.916
than they ever were before we tried
to desegregate them in the first place.

00:07:15.963 --> 00:07:19.556
Teaching my kids about desegregation,
the Little Rock Nine,

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.883
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:24.237
is a real awkward moment in my classroom,

00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:26.962
when I have to hear
the voice of a child ask,

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.243
"If schools were desegregated in 1954,

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:33.564
how come there are no white kids here?"

00:07:33.588 --> 00:07:35.048
(Laughter)

00:07:35.072 --> 00:07:36.428
These kids aren't dumb.

00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:39.016
They know exactly what's happening,

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.889
and what's not.

00:07:41.526 --> 00:07:43.760
They know that when it comes to schooling,

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.260
black lives don't matter

00:07:47.081 --> 00:07:48.493
and they never have.

00:07:50.316 --> 00:07:56.831
For years, I tried desperately
to cultivate in my kids a love of reading.

00:07:57.416 --> 00:08:00.280
I'd amassed a modest classroom library

00:08:00.304 --> 00:08:03.601
of books I'd accumulated
from secondhand shops,

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:06.088
thrift stores, attics -- you know.

00:08:06.112 --> 00:08:08.572
But whenever I said those dreadful words,

00:08:08.596 --> 00:08:10.792
"Take out a book and read,"

00:08:10.816 --> 00:08:13.249
you'd think I'd just declared war.

00:08:13.273 --> 00:08:14.966
It was torture.

00:08:15.693 --> 00:08:16.857
One day,

00:08:17.184 --> 00:08:20.314
after I'd heard about this website
called DonorsChoose,

00:08:20.338 --> 00:08:22.654
where classroom teachers create wish lists

00:08:22.678 --> 00:08:24.782
of items they need for their classroom

00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:27.333
and anonymous donors fulfill them,

00:08:27.357 --> 00:08:31.358
I figured I'd go out on a limb
and just make a wish list

00:08:31.382 --> 00:08:34.595
of the teenager's dream library.

00:08:35.698 --> 00:08:39.890
Over 200 brand-new books
were sent to my room piece by piece.

00:08:40.672 --> 00:08:45.245
Every day there were new deliveries
and my kids would exclaim with glee,

00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:47.226
"This feels like Christmas!"

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.330
(Laughter)

00:08:48.354 --> 00:08:49.519
Then they'd say,

00:08:49.543 --> 00:08:52.415
"Ms. Sumner, where did
these books come from?"

00:08:52.439 --> 00:08:53.655
And then I'd reply,

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:57.655
"Strangers from all over the country
wanted you to have these."

00:08:58.274 --> 00:09:00.951
And then they'd say, almost suspiciously,

00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:04.201
"But they're brand-new."

00:09:04.225 --> 00:09:05.227
(Laughter)

00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:06.830
To which I'd reply,

00:09:06.854 --> 00:09:08.634
"You deserve brand-new books."

00:09:10.137 --> 00:09:13.560
The whole experience hit home
for me when one of my girls,

00:09:13.584 --> 00:09:16.654
as she peeled open a crisp paperback said,

00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:21.960
"Ms. Sumner -- you know,
I figured you bought these books,

00:09:21.984 --> 00:09:24.722
'cause you teachers
are always buying us stuff.

00:09:25.158 --> 00:09:29.187
But to know that a stranger,
someone I don't even know,

00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:30.910
cares this much about me

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.935
is pretty cool."

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.495
Knowing that strangers
will take care of you

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:38.545
is a privilege my kids aren't afforded.

00:09:40.342 --> 00:09:41.784
Ever since the donation,

00:09:41.808 --> 00:09:45.666
there has been a steady stream of kids
signing out books to take home,

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.350
and then returning them
with the exclamation,

00:09:48.374 --> 00:09:49.962
"This one was good!"

00:09:49.986 --> 00:09:51.034
(Laughter)

00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:53.360
Now when I say,
"Take out a book and read,"

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:55.603
kids rush to my library.

00:09:56.849 --> 00:09:58.896
It wasn't that they didn't want to read,

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.470
but instead, they'd gladly read
if the resources were there.

00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:07.231
Institutionally speaking,

00:10:07.255 --> 00:10:11.607
our public school system has never
done right by the black and brown child.

00:10:12.068 --> 00:10:14.616
We keep focusing on the end results

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.005
or test results,

00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:17.875
and getting frustrated.

00:10:17.899 --> 00:10:20.036
We get to a catastrophe and we wonder,

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.897
"How did it get so bad?
How did we get here?"

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.045
Really?

00:10:25.439 --> 00:10:27.514
If you neglect a child long enough,

00:10:27.538 --> 00:10:30.628
you no longer have
the right to be surprised

00:10:30.652 --> 00:10:32.483
when things don't turn out well.

00:10:33.319 --> 00:10:35.053
Stop being perplexed

00:10:35.077 --> 00:10:36.703
or confused

00:10:36.727 --> 00:10:38.203
or befuddled

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.606
by the achievement gap,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.853
the income gap,

00:10:41.877 --> 00:10:43.496
the incarceration rates,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.567
or whatever socioeconomic disparity
is the new "it" term for the moment.

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:51.690
The problems we have as a country

00:10:51.714 --> 00:10:53.797
are the problems we created as a country.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.278
The quality of your education
is directly proportionate

00:10:58.302 --> 00:11:00.160
to your access to college,

00:11:00.184 --> 00:11:01.912
your access to jobs,

00:11:01.936 --> 00:11:03.644
your access to the future.

00:11:05.594 --> 00:11:10.864
Until we live in a world where every kid
can get a high-quality education

00:11:10.888 --> 00:11:12.424
no matter where they live,

00:11:12.448 --> 00:11:14.328
or the color of their skin,

00:11:14.352 --> 00:11:18.412
there are things we can do
on a macro level.

00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:22.953
School funding should not
be decided by property taxes

00:11:22.977 --> 00:11:25.208
or some funky economic equation

00:11:25.232 --> 00:11:28.268
where rich kids continue
to benefit from state aid,

00:11:28.292 --> 00:11:32.377
while poor kids are continuously
having food and resources

00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:33.994
taken from their mouths.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.511
Governors, senators, mayors,
city council members --

00:11:38.535 --> 00:11:41.399
if we're going to call
public education public education,

00:11:41.423 --> 00:11:43.006
then it should be just that.

00:11:43.555 --> 00:11:46.538
Otherwise, we should
call it what it really is:

00:11:46.562 --> 00:11:48.127
poverty insurance.

00:11:49.211 --> 00:11:50.653
"Public education:

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:53.765
keeping poor kids poor since 1954."

00:11:53.789 --> 00:11:55.241
(Laughter)

00:11:56.733 --> 00:12:01.831
If we really, as a country, believe
that education is the "great equalizer,"

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:05.686
then it should be just that:
equal and equitable.

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:10.501
Until then, there's no democracy
in our democratic education.

00:12:11.493 --> 00:12:13.000
On a mezzo level:

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.842
historically speaking, the education
of the black and brown child

00:12:16.866 --> 00:12:20.337
has always depended
on the philanthropy of others.

00:12:20.361 --> 00:12:23.155
And unfortunately, today it still does.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.135
If your son or daughter or niece
or nephew or neighbor

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:29.722
or little Timmy down the street

00:12:30.253 --> 00:12:32.556
goes to an affluent school,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.754
challenge your school committee
to adopt an impoverished school

00:12:35.778 --> 00:12:37.817
or an impoverished classroom.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:41.238
Close the divide by engaging
in communication

00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:43.459
and relationships that matter.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.004
When resources are shared,

00:12:46.028 --> 00:12:47.720
they're not divided;

00:12:47.744 --> 00:12:49.201
they're multiplied.

00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:51.710
And on a micro level:

00:12:51.734 --> 00:12:53.554
if you're a human being,

00:12:53.985 --> 00:12:55.151
donate.

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:59.587
Time, money, resources, opportunities --

00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:01.974
whatever is in your heart.

00:13:02.847 --> 00:13:05.051
There are websites like DonorsChoose

00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:07.129
that recognize the disparity

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:09.648
and actually want
to do something about it.

00:13:11.748 --> 00:13:13.952
What is a carpenter with no tools?

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.672
What is an actress with no stage?

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.447
What is a scientist with no laboratory?

00:13:19.859 --> 00:13:22.586
What is a doctor with no equipment?

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.515
I'll tell you:

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.434
they're my kids.

00:13:27.219 --> 00:13:29.035
Shouldn't they be your kids, too?

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:31.044
Thank you.

00:13:31.068 --> 00:13:37.273
(Applause)
