00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.640
June 2010.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.640
I landed for the first time
in Rome, Italy.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.696
I wasn't there to sightsee.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.840
I was there to solve world hunger.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.256
(Laughter)

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.496
That's right.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.616
I was a 25-year-old PhD student

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.736
armed with a prototype tool
developed back at my university,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.840
and I was going to help
the World Food Programme fix hunger.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.576
So I strode into the headquarters building

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.416
and my eyes scanned the row of UN flags,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.400
and I smiled as I thought to myself,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.456
"The engineer is here."

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.696
(Laughter)

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.496
Give me your data.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.696
I'm going to optimize everything.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.456
(Laughter)

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.376
Tell me the food that you've purchased,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.016
tell me where it's going
and when it needs to be there,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.776
and I'm going to tell you
the shortest, fastest, cheapest,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.736
best set of routes to take for the food.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.256
We're going to save money,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.376
we're going to avoid
delays and disruptions,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.136
and bottom line,
we're going to save lives.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.376
You're welcome.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.096
(Laughter)

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.096
I thought it was going to take 12 months,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.680
OK, maybe even 13.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.080
This is not quite how it panned out.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.376
Just a couple of months into the project,
my French boss, he told me,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.216
"You know, Mallory,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.896
it's a good idea,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.256
but the data you need
for your algorithms is not there.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.816
It's the right idea but at the wrong time,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.136
and the right idea at the wrong time

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.536
is the wrong idea."

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.880
(Laughter)

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.240
Project over.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.320
I was crushed.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.456
When I look back now

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.136
on that first summer in Rome

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.816
and I see how much has changed
over the past six years,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080
it is an absolute transformation.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.040
It's a coming of age for bringing data
into the humanitarian world.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.816
It's exciting. It's inspiring.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.040
But we're not there yet.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.616
And brace yourself, executives,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.616
because I'm going to be putting companies

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.760
on the hot seat to step up
and play the role that I know they can.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.336
My experiences back in Rome prove

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.440
using data you can save lives.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.896
OK, not that first attempt,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.496
but eventually we got there.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.256
Let me paint the picture for you.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.016
Imagine that you have to plan
breakfast, lunch and dinner

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.656
for 500,000 people,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.816
and you only have
a certain budget to do it,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.080
say 6.5 million dollars per month.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.682
Well, what should you do?
What's the best way to handle it?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.040
Should you buy rice, wheat, chickpea, oil?

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.976
How much?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.136
It sounds simple. It's not.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.376
You have 30 possible foods,
and you have to pick five of them.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.816
That's already over 140,000
different combinations.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.536
Then for each food that you pick,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.536
you need to decide how much you'll buy,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.256
where you're going to get it from,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.760
where you're going to store it,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.736
how long it's going to take to get there.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.096
You need to look at all of the different
transportation routes as well.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.200
And that's already
over 900 million options.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.496
If you considered each option
for a single second,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.856
that would take you
over 28 years to get through.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.400
900 million options.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.616
So we created a tool
that allowed decisionmakers

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.256
to weed through all 900 million options

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.640
in just a matter of days.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.800
It turned out to be incredibly successful.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.656
In an operation in Iraq,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.216
we saved 17 percent of the costs,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.376
and this meant that you had the ability
to feed an additional 80,000 people.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.800
It's all thanks to the use of data
and modeling complex systems.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.080
But we didn't do it alone.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.576
The unit that I worked with in Rome,
they were unique.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.336
They believed in collaboration.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.056
They brought in the academic world.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.360
They brought in companies.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.816
And if we really want to make big changes
in big problems like world hunger,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.400
we need everybody to the table.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.976
We need the data people
from humanitarian organizations

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.256
leading the way,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.856
and orchestrating
just the right types of engagements

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.576
with academics, with governments.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.296
And there's one group that's not being
leveraged in the way that it should be.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.416
Did you guess it? Companies.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.040
Companies have a major role to play
in fixing the big problems in our world.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.296
I've been in the private sector
for two years now.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.896
I've seen what companies can do,
and I've seen what companies aren't doing,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.296
and I think there's three main ways
that we can fill that gap:

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.416
by donating data,
by donating decision scientists

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.920
and by donating technology
to gather new sources of data.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.496
This is data philanthropy,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.360
and it's the future of corporate
social responsibility.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.760
Bonus, it also makes good business sense.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.136
Companies today,
they collect mountains of data,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.922
so the first thing they can do
is start donating that data.

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:43.136
Some companies are already doing it.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.576
Take, for example,
a major telecom company.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.376
They opened up their data
in Senegal and the Ivory Coast

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.376
and researchers discovered

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.734
that if you look at the patterns
in the pings to the cell phone towers,

00:04:53.758 --> 00:04:55.696
you can see where people are traveling.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.896
And that can tell you things like

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.016
where malaria might spread,
and you can make predictions with it.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.936
Or take for example
an innovative satellite company.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.976
They opened up their data and donated it,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.656
and with that data you could track

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.720
how droughts are impacting
food production.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.600
With that you can actually trigger
aid funding before a crisis can happen.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.840
This is a great start.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.720
There's important insights
just locked away in company data.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.296
And yes, you need to be very careful.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.896
You need to respect privacy concerns,
for example by anonymizing the data.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.696
But even if the floodgates opened up,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.256
and even if all companies
donated their data

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.536
to academics, to NGOs,
to humanitarian organizations,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.536
it wouldn't be enough
to harness that full impact of data

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.080
for humanitarian goals.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.776
Why?

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.040
To unlock insights in data,
you need decision scientists.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.336
Decision scientists are people like me.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.176
They take the data, they clean it up,

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.456
transform it and put it
into a useful algorithm

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.320
that's the best choice
to address the business need at hand.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.496
In the world of humanitarian aid,
there are very few decision scientists.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.160
Most of them work for companies.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.976
So that's the second thing
that companies need to do.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.696
In addition to donating their data,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.880
they need to donate
their decision scientists.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.256
Now, companies will say, "Ah! Don't take
our decision scientists from us.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.320
We need every spare second of their time."

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.560
But there's a way.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.616
If a company was going to donate
a block of a decision scientist's time,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.776
it would actually make more sense
to spread out that block of time

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.000
over a long period,
say for example five years.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.656
This might only amount
to a couple of hours per month,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.736
which a company would hardly miss,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.240
but what it enables is really important:
long-term partnerships.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.736
Long-term partnerships
allow you to build relationships,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.416
to get to know the data,
to really understand it

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.856
and to start to understand
the needs and challenges

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.040
that the humanitarian
organization is facing.

00:06:54.345 --> 00:06:57.536
In Rome, at the World Food Programme,
this took us five years to do,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.016
five years.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.376
That first three years, OK,
that was just what we couldn't solve for.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.896
Then there was two years after that
of refining and implementing the tool,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.720
like in the operations in Iraq
and other countries.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.616
I don't think that's
an unrealistic timeline

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.376
when it comes to using data
to make operational changes.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.800
It's an investment. It requires patience.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.256
But the types of results
that can be produced are undeniable.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.840
In our case, it was the ability
to feed tens of thousands more people.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.776
So we have donating data,
we have donating decision scientists,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.496
and there's actually a third way
that companies can help:

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.496
donating technology
to capture new sources of data.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.360
You see, there's a lot of things
we just don't have data on.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.680
Right now, Syrian refugees
are flooding into Greece,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.680
and the UN refugee agency,
they have their hands full.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.056
The current system for tracking people
is paper and pencil,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.336
and what that means is

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.216
that when a mother and her five children
walk into the camp,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.896
headquarters is essentially
blind to this moment.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.256
That's all going to change
in the next few weeks,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.160
thanks to private sector collaboration.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.496
There's going to be a new system based
on donated package tracking technology

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.560
from the logistics company
that I work for.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.456
With this new system,
there will be a data trail,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.936
so you know exactly the moment

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.456
when that mother and her children
walk into the camp.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.096
And even more, you know
if she's going to have supplies

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.376
this month and the next.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.416
Information visibility drives efficiency.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.696
For companies, using technology
to gather important data,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.176
it's like bread and butter.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.776
They've been doing it for years,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.056
and it's led to major
operational efficiency improvements.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.440
Just try to imagine
your favorite beverage company

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.856
trying to plan their inventory

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.376
and not knowing how many bottles
were on the shelves.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.616
It's absurd.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.200
Data drives better decisions.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.336
Now, if you're representing a company,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.496
and you're pragmatic
and not just idealistic,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.576
you might be saying to yourself,
"OK, this is all great, Mallory,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.440
but why should I want to be involved?"

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.816
Well for one thing, beyond the good PR,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.616
humanitarian aid
is a 24-billion-dollar sector,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.696
and there's over five billion people,
maybe your next customers,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.536
that live in the developing world.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.656
Further, companies that are engaging
in data philanthropy,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.656
they're finding new insights
locked away in their data.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.936
Take, for example, a credit card company

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.296
that's opened up a center

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.696
that functions as a hub for academics,
for NGOs and governments,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.960
all working together.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.776
They're looking at information
in credit card swipes

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.776
and using that to find insights
about how households in India

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.520
live, work, earn and spend.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.256
For the humanitarian world,
this provides information

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.936
about how you might
bring people out of poverty.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.976
But for companies, it's providing
insights about your customers

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.040
and potential customers in India.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.560
It's a win all around.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.736
Now, for me, what I find
exciting about data philanthropy --

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.096
donating data, donating decision
scientists and donating technology --

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.496
it's what it means
for young professionals like me

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.360
who are choosing to work at companies.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.456
Studies show that
the next generation of the workforce

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.040
care about having their work
make a bigger impact.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.376
We want to make a difference,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.816
and so through data philanthropy,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.776
companies can actually help engage
and retain their decision scientists.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.680
And that's a big deal for a profession
that's in high demand.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.960
Data philanthropy
makes good business sense,

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.480
and it also can help
revolutionize the humanitarian world.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.696
If we coordinated
the planning and logistics

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.096
across all of the major facets
of a humanitarian operation,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.720
we could feed, clothe and shelter
hundreds of thousands more people,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.696
and companies need to step up
and play the role that I know they can

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.600
in bringing about this revolution.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.656
You've probably heard of the saying
"food for thought."

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.920
Well, this is literally thought for food.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.696
It finally is the right idea
at the right time.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.936
(Laughter)

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.536
Très magnifique.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.776
Thank you.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.651
(Applause)
